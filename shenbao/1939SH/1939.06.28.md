(Hong Kong) According to authoritative sources in Hong Kong, several Japanese warships suddenly opened fire on Fuzhou at dawn on the 27th, bombarding it intensely. Subsequently, marines were dispatched to land on Chuanshi Island at the mouth of the Min River, 30 miles from Fuzhou. The situation in Fuzhou is extremely tense. Before landing, the Japanese side issued warnings to foreign businesses, stating that military action would be taken against Fuzhou and Wenzhou, and all ships were required to leave by noon on the 29th. Currently, a British destroyer is anchored off the coast of Fuzhou. (Special dispatch, 27th)

(Hong Kong) In the Chaoshan Railway area, Chinese aid troops have gathered, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. Traces of the Japanese army were discovered in Fengxi, three kilometers south of Chaozhou, and they were surrounded and annihilated last night. However, the situation in Chaozhou remains extremely tense. (Special dispatch, 27th)

(Hong Kong) The northern Guangdong front is quiet. Chinese mechanized units have been ordered to move south to strengthen defenses and await an opportunity to counterattack. The Chinese air force also frequently flies over northern Guangdong, bombing Japanese positions heavily. (Special dispatch, 27th)

(Guangzhou) Eight Japanese warships and eight or nine motorboats outside the mouth of the Min River suddenly attacked the Chinese blockade line outside the port at 6:10 this morning. The Japanese warships simultaneously opened fire, bombarding the revolutionary army's coastline for an hour and a half. Several Japanese aircraft also took off to assist. Around 8 o'clock, the artillery fire suddenly ceased, and four Japanese boats carrying hundreds of Japanese soldiers patrolled back and forth near the blockade line. Nine Japanese aircraft then took off from a large aircraft carrier, flying low over the coastal areas of Magui and Changle, and dropping bombs on Changle. Several other Japanese boats approached Chuanshi Island outside the port, forcibly landing several hundred soldiers. (Dispatch, 27th)

Liuhuang According to reports, in Fuyang "more than twenty miles southwest of Chao'an" and Longhu Town (more than twenty miles south of Chao'an), more than a hundred Japanese cavalry were spotted at 10 PM on the 25th. They retreated immediately after being engaged by the Chinese army. The next day, the Japanese army sent reinforcements to attack again, and fierce fighting lasted all day. The Chinese army, deployed on this flat and boundless battlefield, relied on their burning passion to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Later, the Japanese army, relying on their convenient transportation, quickly sent reinforcements, putting great pressure on the Chinese army. In order to preserve its main force, the Chinese army had no choice but to retreat into certain defensive positions, awaiting reinforcements for a counterattack. (Dispatch, 27th)

Liuhuang According to reports, fierce fighting has continued for days in the Caitang area. The Chinese army has held its ground firmly behind fortifications and has launched several counterattacks, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army. Although the army has attacked fiercely with mechanized units, they have not succeeded so far. Subsequently, with the discovery of Japanese troops in Fuyang and Longhu, the rear of Caitang was suddenly threatened, and the troops immediately withdrew to the northeast. (Dispatch, 27th)

(London) During today's parliamentary session, the news of Japan's intention to occupy Wenzhou and Fuzhou was mentioned. Labor Party member Greenwood raised the following questions: Is the government planning to send any instructions to ships in the area that may be affected by the situation? Is the Prime Minister considering cooperating with countries whose ships travel to Wenzhou and Fuzhou? Given the increasingly dangerous situation, is the British government making any progress in its proposed response? The Prime Minister replied that he could not answer those questions at the moment because news of the Japanese military's intention to land had only just been received. The Prime Minister did not respond to further questions. Before answering the above questions, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated that the naval commander stationed in Hong Kong had received news of the Japanese intention to occupy Fuzhou and Wenzhou and was awaiting detailed information. Regarding the situation in Tianjin, the Prime Minister stated that everything had been detailed in yesterday's statement, and there was nothing more to add at this time, but he hoped to have more to report soon. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(Hong Kong) A Japanese detachment landed today at a coastal promontory (translated meaning) approaching Fuzhou. It is reported that the Japanese side warned foreign ships in advance to stay away from the waters outside Fuzhou, as military action would take place there imminently. A British destroyer is currently on standby at the promontory. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(Hong Kong) According to sources here, Japanese warships gathered at the mouth of the Min River this morning, and Japanese marines landed at Jianfeng, opposite Luoxing Pagoda, 30 miles from Fuzhou. The Japanese army is apparently planning to use this as a base to attack Fuzhou. A U.S. gunboat is currently stationed in Fuzhou. According to the U.S. consulate, there are not many American residents in Fuzhou. Furthermore, the British ship "Muller," which was near Wenzhou, reported encountering a Japanese aircraft over the sea near Wenzhou that dropped a warning stating that "military action" would be taken there soon and warning ships not to enter the port. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, fighting is currently extremely fierce in the Anbu area northwest of Shantou. The Chinese army's fortifications there are very strong. The 11,000 Japanese soldiers in the area are mostly drawn from Guangzhou and Xiamen. Furthermore, a Chinese spokesman stated that the blockade line around Shantou had not been sufficiently strengthened in the past because the Chinese side wanted to maintain its foreign trade. The key points of the port were not militarized for the same reason, which made it easy to fall. According to foreign observers, Shantou is a seaport, and the Japanese navy will concentrate its attack there, making its fall sooner or later inevitable. Therefore, it is not necessary to spend large sums of money on building strong defensive fortifications. One of the reasons for the Japanese to capture Shantou is to cut off the Chinese side's import and export trade. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Chaoan According to reports, more than 500 Japanese soldiers launched several fierce attacks on Caitang on the 25th. The Chinese army put up a strong resistance, and fierce fighting broke out. On the evening of the 25th, Japanese cavalry were spotted in Fuyang, twenty miles northwest of Caitang, and fierce fighting is currently underway. (Dispatch, 26th)

Chaoan More than twenty Japanese aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs on various towns and villages in the Chaozhou region in batches today. The town of Chaozhou is under constant air raid alert, and the residents of the city have been evacuated as much as possible. (Dispatch, 26th)

Jinhua At 8:10 on the morning of the 26th, five Japanese warships, six motorboats, and more than ten civilian ships, under the cover of artillery fire, forcibly landed at Yuhuan Kanmen Town, Yacheng, and other places. The Chinese army met them with a head-on attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. Fierce fighting continued until night. (Dispatch, 27th)

(Hong Kong) The Japanese army in Shantou issued a communiqu√© today stating that Chaozhou, the northern terminus of the Shantou-Chaozhou Railway, was occupied by the Japanese army at 1:30 this morning. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(Chongqing) A large number of Japanese warships and transport ships have gathered outside the port of Fuzhou, and it is expected that the Japanese army will soon land and fight in Fuzhou. According to Chinese estimates, there are approximately eighteen Japanese cruisers, destroyers, and transport ships anchored outside Fuzhou. However, according to the Chinese military, it will not be easy for Japanese warships to enter the port of Fuzhou because Fuzhou has water barriers, unlike Shantou. The Chinese side has completed its defensive fortifications in preparation for a Japanese landing, and all local administrative agencies have been moved inland. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(Chongqing) After the fall of Shantou, one branch of the Japanese army advanced along the Han River toward Chaozhou by motorboat, and another branch of the Japanese army advanced along the Shantou-Chaozhou Railway. Although the tracks and bridges have been destroyed, the terrain is flat and easy to travel. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(Hong Kong) It is reported that the Japanese army has landed at Jianfeng on the coast near Fuzhou. The Japanese side had previously warned foreign ships not to enter Fuzhou, as war was about to break out. British naval authorities here have not yet received confirmation from British destroyers stationed there regarding the Japanese landing. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(Tokyo) According to a telegram from the Japanese military headquarters, Chaozhou, the terminus of the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway, has been captured by the Japanese army. The city is 42 kilometers from Shantou. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 27th)

(Hong Kong) According to British reports here, the Japanese navy landed 30 miles from Fuzhou at dawn this morning. Before landing, the Japanese navy issued a warning to foreign ships, stating that there would be military action in the port and asking them to evacuate.

(Hong Kong) According to news received here, as a result of the Japanese army's three-pronged attack on Chaozhou, Chaozhou has been captured. Ten thousand Chinese soldiers have changed their positions and continue to resist. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 27th)

### Authorities order Chongqing residents to evacuate by the end of June. Those who fail to comply after the deadline will be subject to imprisonment, and additional checkpoints will be set up to inspect pedestrian passports.

(Chongqing) According to sources here, the Chinese authorities have now ordered Chongqing residents to evacuate Chongqing by the end of June. Those who fail to evacuate after this date will be subject to imprisonment or fines. In order to prevent people from all over the country from gathering in Chongqing again, the Chongqing Garrison Command will set up additional checkpoints at the thoroughfares outside the city to check whether those entering the city have passports. Foreigners can have their embassies apply for residence permits on their behalf, but the procedure is quite difficult, especially for servants employed by foreigners.

The three Japanese pilots, Taotao Zhenmu, Hui Gu Shiye, and Wei Teng Tianzhen, were killed on the spot, and the fuselage was burned. The Chinese side seized two machine guns, telescopes, maps, and many other parts. (Dispatch, 27th)

### Chamberlain says Tianjin Incident may be resolved amicably, British Ambassador to Japan meets Arita again, discussing ways to resolve the Tianjin dispute, Japanese Foreign Minister visits various parties for secret talks, negotiations seem to be conducted in Tokyo.

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a declaration in the House of Commons today, stating that the Tianjin incident could be resolved amicably. Members of Parliament were surprised to hear this and asked on what basis the Prime Minister said so. Political figures said that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie was only instructed to protest the maltreatment of British residents in Tianjin, not to discuss the entire issue. However, he still hoped that the Tianjin case could be resolved amicably, indicating that Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration was based less on new factors and more on expressing Ambassador Craigie's hopes. Although these people also hoped that the Tianjin case could reach a "compromise" solution, they did not express what kind of solution it would be. Diplomatic figures believe that the 50 million Chinese yuan deposited by Chinese banks in the British concession in Tianjin is the most coveted by the Japanese side, and it is more important than the extradition of four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case. Opposition parties in Parliament deeply believe that the Japanese side will prolong the current ambiguous situation in Tianjin as much as possible, so that the British side believes that an amicable solution is still possible, and the implementation of economic retaliation will be delayed. At the same time, they are stepping up their efforts to undermine British prestige, so they are quite anxious. In short, the British government still hopes that the moderate faction in Japan will be willing to avoid economic conflict with Britain and will restrain the military, so it will wait a few more days, until the moderate faction is no longer able to do anything, and then announce the abolition of the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

(London) According to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met last night and continued to consider the situation in the Far East. It is expected that it will soon announce the start of negotiations in Tokyo. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie received instructions from the British government yesterday to negotiate with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, which made Foreign Minister Arita quite busy today. According to Japanese sources, the British Ambassador suggested to Foreign Minister Arita that the Tianjin incident should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations in Tokyo. It is reported that Foreign Minister Arita secretly discussed the British proposal with Prime Minister Hiranuma this morning, and after attending the Cabinet meeting, he visited Minister of the Army Itagaki and Minister of the Navy Yonai to exchange views on the Tianjin issue. He visited Minister of the Army again at 3:00 p.m. for secret talks lasting about an hour. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(London) Regarding the Tianjin incident, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita again this morning to study the Tianjin case and whether there was a possibility of an amicable solution. In addition, regarding the request from the Japanese naval authorities in China that warships and merchant ships of all countries leave the ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou in China before the 29th of this month, officials here are unaware of this. Responsible parties believe that the rumors may be exaggerated, but in any case, the British will not give up their trading rights in the treaty ports in China. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

(Tokyo) It is reported that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met for 40 minutes last night to discuss the basis for negotiating the Tianjin dispute. However, according to the Kokumin Shimbun, the British Ambassador conveyed Britain's attitude towards the Tianjin situation and requested a formal response from the Japanese government to Britain's protest. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(London) The National Labor Committee met in London today to discuss the international situation, paying attention to the Japanese problem. It is reported that the committee has a serious view of the recent Tianjin incident and is discussing the issue of discussing this matter with the government immediately. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Britain should help China on a large scale.

(London) Independent Progressive Party Member of Parliament Bartlett published an article in the News Chronicle today, stating that during the meeting of the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee last night, someone suggested that Japan could cancel its movement in Tianjin under certain conditions. Therefore, in the next few days, the British side will find an excuse to hand over the four suspects in the Cheng Xigeng assassination case to the Chinese court, in other words, extradite them to the Japanese. This is not surprising. Bartlett argued that Britain should strengthen China's currency system, as this is the best way to force Japan to change its policies. Today's editorial in the same newspaper also urged the British side to provide large-scale financial and economic assistance to China, and said that if Britain does not retaliate against Japanese provocations, there is a real danger, because the National Socialist Party may determine that we do not care about Europe. The Daily Mail urged British women to stop buying Japanese goods, so that the Japanese government would know that its insulting policies are not worth the cost. The Manchester Guardian also stated that our most important ally in the Far East is China, not the United States or France. Most of the retaliatory measures currently proposed are to restrict Japanese exports to the British Empire. However, we must know that there are other more moderate methods that can be adopted, namely, helping China. We can supply China with loans, airplanes, and tanks to strengthen its resistance to Japan. This is also an effective response to Japan. The real front line in the Far East is not in Tianjin, Hong Kong, or Singapore, but in the mountains of northwestern China and the river basins of southern China. (London dispatch, 27th)

### The United States will discuss sending a fleet.

(Washington) The Washington Star published an article today stating that Washington is now discussing the possibility of sending an American fleet to the Far East. British and French sea power are now preoccupied with affairs in Europe. In terms of the ability to protect the rights and interests of civilized nations at sea in the Far East, the American flag is the only symbol that can represent the rights and interests of civilized nations at sea in the Far East. Former U.S. President Roosevelt's plan to send the American fleet around the world in 1907, which paid special attention to Japan, can be reconsidered today. U.S. political circles have not criticized this suggestion, but during the recent tense situation in the Far East, naval circles discussed the possibility of moving the fleet to Hawaii or Manila. According to reliable sources, the U.S. authorities are most concerned about amending the Neutrality Act, so the government hopes to avoid actions that could hinder the passage of the Neutrality Act amendment. However, if other countries want to take advantage of this opportunity and say that the United States is only focused on domestic legislation and has no time to take care of other matters, then they are greatly mistaken. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull said that American diplomatic representatives are still discussing the China incident with the British and French governments, but there have been no new developments in the past few days. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Editorial

### Review of the Soviet-Japanese Conflict

In China, in the area of Lake Bel, bordering Mongolia and Manchuria, the air and land forces of the Soviet Union and Japan have been fighting repeatedly from mid-May to the day before yesterday. Adding to this is a week-long propaganda war. What the two sides have announced, apart from still maintaining their original defenses to this day, and the consistency of their words, the rest is completely different. For example, Japan claimed that Soviet troops violated the border, and the Japanese-Manchukuo forces drove them out of the border, achieving a great victory; the Soviet Union claimed that Japanese troops violated the border, and the Soviet-Mongolian forces annihilated the enemy on the spot and repulsed them all; the number of enemy planes lost and soldiers killed and wounded claimed by each side is greatly disparate. Any military force represents its country, and its actions are part of the country's actions, which the country must take responsibility for. Now, the land and air forces of the Soviet Union and Japan have been fighting for more than a month. How can this not be a major national event? However, neither side, in their announcements, has attributed the conflict to a misunderstanding, nor has either side held the other accountable. The two countries still have their exchange of envoys, and no routine diplomatic protests have been heard. The forbearance of the two countries is truly a miracle. When the news spread far and wide, the world was refreshed, but the impression reflected was mostly regarded as novel and large-scale news, without considering it an extremely important and worrying unexpected serious change. Alas, is this numbness? International norms have been lost, world affairs are on the brink of extreme danger, and there is no shock at bloodshed. However, at the very least, this is news. We journalists are willing to review it.

Based on the propaganda of both the Soviet Union and Japan regarding the results of the military conflict, it is difficult to judge which side suffered heavier losses and which side occupied a superior position due to lack of sufficient evidence. However, based on common sense: The Soviet Union admitted on May 28 that its air force suffered the loss of nine aircraft due to lack of preparation, while destroying three of the enemy's aircraft, without concealing its defeat; while Japan's self-reported record is one of invincibility; this is one point. In air battles, the Soviet Union's account of the number of aircraft on both sides is always similar, with the Soviet Union's losses being less and Japan's losses being more, but still relatively close; in air battles, Japan's account of the number of aircraft on both sides is always that the Soviet Union had more aircraft and Japan had fewer, and the Soviet Union's losses were five or ten times greater than Japan's; this is another point. Even these two points alone make it impossible to discover the most accurate reality. However, the Japanese side's exaggeration is so great that common sense judges it to be false. Japan has clearly lost in this "propaganda war." Propaganda must be sincere, or at least close to the truth. Japanese-style propaganda seeks to exaggerate without seeking credibility. This has always been the case, and the Soviet-Japanese conflict is just one example.

Regarding the origin of the conflict, the Soviet Union and Japan each blamed the other for violating the border. To violate the border is to be proactive, to be on the offensive, and to bear the responsibility. We cannot evaluate the responsibility based on the propaganda of both sides. However, generally speaking: The Soviet government, in its fundamental policies, is determined not to participate in war, let alone launch war. The Japanese government, in its international policies, only wishes not to fight the Soviet Union alone. During these two years of invading China, its strength has been depleted, and it is afraid that the Soviet Union will provoke a war. How could it be willing to start a war with the Soviet Union? This is the reality of both sides, and we secretly believe that it is in accordance with reason. Therefore, it can be deduced that this conflict was not initiated by instructions from Tokyo or Moscow. Yesterday's report from the German Haitong News Agency in Tokyo, claiming that people in Tokyo political circles said that the conflict was not an isolated incident but an organized action by Moscow to contain the Japanese army and remotely aid China, is clearly another distorted propaganda with a different purpose. In terms of having a different purpose, the Soviet Union's national conditions are simple, and the government's choices never deviate from fundamental policies, so "small actions" with a different purpose are less necessary. Japan, on the other hand, seeks to advance or retreat both internally and externally, and its national conditions and national policies are not like those of the Soviet Union, so its rulers often need small actions with a different purpose at times, and it is reasonable to create propaganda materials. Even with these claims, we still do not believe that the conflict was initiated in Tokyo. Not initiated by Tokyo, and even less by Moscow, then the conflict must have been an individual action by the local garrison. In terms of individual actions, we will not take the Soviet Union's published secret order of the commander of the Japanese 23rd Division (see yesterday's newspaper) as ironclad proof that the Japanese side initiated the conflict, but we may as well ask two questions: Did the Soviet garrison violate Moscow's policies and attack the Japanese defense line without receiving orders from Moscow? Did the Japanese garrison violate Tokyo's policies and attack the Soviet defense line without receiving orders from Tokyo? Which of these two scenarios has a precedent, which has a habit, and which has a higher possibility? The conflict is a matter for both sides, but it is definitely not launched simultaneously by both sides without intention. Therefore, there must be one side that is proactive, takes the offensive, and bears the responsibility! We secretly believe that the possibility of this conflict being initiated by the Japanese garrison is higher.

We do not want to act as interpreters to explain everything about others. We are only assuming that the aforementioned reasoning is not wrong and analyzing the rationale for initiating the conflict. We believe that Japan's joys and sorrows, its wandering down divergent paths in the international arena, have their own internal contradictions, which have led to fragmented actions. There are extreme right-wingers who advocate being hostile to the Soviet Union, severing ties with Britain, and thoroughly allying with Germany and Italy; there are moderates who advocate maintaining the anti-Soviet front with Germany and Italy while avoiding deepening friction with Britain, France, and the United States. The two factions are evenly matched domestically and are in a state of waxing and waning. Surrounding the Tianjin concession, landing in Shantou, and even engaging in clashes with the Soviet garrison are all ways to force the moderates to sever ties with Britain, and also ways to make the unexpected tension in Soviet-Japanese relations promote relations with Germany and Italy. At the same time, it shows the deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations, causing Britain to shy away and abandon its alliance with the Soviet Union, which is also a way to serve Germany and Italy and strengthen the solidarity of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Running around in all directions, there is indeed a consistent consciousness running through it as a thread.

### Japanese Incitement Ineffective; Anti-British Movement Fails; Only 500 Attend Assembly; Procession Fails to Attract Interest; Tianjin Concession Situation Seems Slightly Relaxed; Guerrillas Attack Police Station in Southern Suburbs

(Beijing) The anti-British movement organized by the Japanese in Beijing has made no progress among the Chinese people. Yesterday's mass rally, which invited thousands of students, teachers, and officials to participate, was a complete failure. Only 500 people attended, and the subsequent procession failed to attract any interest. Newspapers controlled by the Japanese have published several columns of anti-British propaganda, but few listen to them. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

(Tianjin) Today, no unexpected incidents occurred at the entrances and exits of the concessions. The general feeling is that the situation here has slightly eased. Some people believe that this situation is a sign that major negotiations regarding the Tianjin situation are currently underway in Tokyo. According to reliable Chinese sources, Japanese sentries searching those passing through the concession entrances and exits have been replaced this morning, at least at the Wanguo Bridge, and seem to have received certain orders. According to sources in the foreign community, this matter may confirm the remarks made by the Japanese military commander, which have been notified to the Japanese sentries. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

(Tianjin) The shortage of milk has not improved this morning, making the situation in the British concession hospitals even more serious, and many patients are affected. A Japanese customs official in the isolation hospital also has no milk available. The hospital administrator has notified the Consul-General that the official's life is in danger due to the inability to obtain milk. Several foreign visitors arrived here this morning and were led by Japanese officers on a tour in front of various obstacles. They were riding in several luxurious Japanese military automobiles, each carrying two officers and visitors. They passed through the British concession and entered the former German concession. It is heard that the Japanese Consulate will hold a special meeting for these visitors this morning. A Reuters reporter went to the border this morning and saw nothing unusual, but there was still a long line of Chinese people wanting to enter the British and French concessions who were being deliberately searched. According to unconfirmed Chinese sources, just after 11 pm on Sunday night, 60 Chinese guerrillas attacked the police station in the southern suburbs of Tianjin. Rifle fire continued for some time, clearly heard in the British concession. By the time Japanese soldiers and Chinese police reinforcements arrived, the guerrillas had retreated, taking several Chinese policemen hostage as they left. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### British Consulate Replies to Japanese Protest

(Tianjin) It is heard that the British Consul-General, Jamieson, has replied to the note from the Japanese Consul-General, Tashiro, protesting the Tianjin incident news published in British newspapers. The contents include the following three points: (1) Acknowledging receipt of the Japanese protest regarding the British newspapers' distortion of facts. (2) Requesting the Japanese Consul-General to provide evidence for the matters protested. (3) The British Consul-General will send a copy of the signed statements of the British subjects who have been insulted to the Japanese authorities, and at the same time request an investigation and reply. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### Japanese Not Ashamed of Nudity

(Tianjin) General Honma, commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, stated today while hosting foreign journalists here that the Japanese authorities had instructed the search personnel this morning not to engage in insulting actions, that British subjects could be exempted from strip searches, and that the search personnel were ordered to be more cautious in all measures. The commander emphasized that the Japanese are not ashamed of nudity and smiled as he offered to take off his clothes in public to prove his point. He then mentioned the Japanese custom of mixed bathing for men and women, saying that there is nothing insulting about being seen naked. The commander solemnly stated that he had not received any news of foreigners being stripped and that he had not issued such an order. The current restrictions will continue to be implemented until the British change their attitude. Japan's current methods will continue indefinitely, even if the British take retaliatory measures against Japan. The commander also mentioned the four demands regarding the Tianjin incident recently submitted by the "Provisional Government" to the British and French embassies in Beijing, saying that these demands were prepared by the "Provisional Government" and were not discussed with Japan beforehand, but that their content roughly represents Japan's opinions and aspirations. A reporter asked what the minimum demands of the Japanese army in Tianjin would be. The commander replied that he could not disclose this, that he did not know whether it would be resolved in Tianjin, Tokyo, or London, but hoped that the matter could be resolved locally. When the commander mentioned the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, he solemnly stated that although the details of this matter had not been discussed with Tokyo, all plans were implemented under orders from Tokyo. Calling the current situation in Tianjin a "blockade" is inaccurate; it should be called "restrictions on traffic." The Japanese authorities have no intention of cutting off the food supply to the concessions. The current difficulties are due to unavoidable delays at the entrances and exits, which are necessary for a thorough search of all goods entering the concessions. As for river traffic, it has not been restricted except for the inspection of ships entering and leaving the port, and river traffic cannot be restricted without a special order from Tokyo. Regarding the British military trucks, this was because the trucks did not comply with the traffic regulations, as the trucks wanted to travel on one-way traffic roads. When reporters asked if the restrictions would be further tightened, General Honma hesitated for a moment and then replied that the plan adopted was flexible, so the possibility of tightening could not be ruled out. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### Truth About the Stripping of British Subject

(Tianjin) Mr. Holthus, son of the former British Consul in Tianjin, was ordered to strip today and suffered various other humiliations, as witnessed by me (Associated Press Far East Manager, Mr. Mullisher), as I happened to be standing outside the door of the search post at the intersection of Wilson Street. At that time, a puppet Chinese policeman was ordered by a Japanese sentry, and the Chinese policeman immediately forced Mr. Holthus to strip and unbutton his trousers. Then, Mr. Holthus was ordered to let his trousers fall to the ground, and the Chinese policeman searched him all over. When I entered the search post, a puppet Chinese policeman touched my pockets and ordered me to sit down. However, the Japanese person standing there glanced at me briefly and, after examining my American passport and card, let me go. Mr. Holthus lives near the Xiangzong Guild Hall outside the British concession, but his office is in the British concession. I specially accompanied Mr. Holthus today from his office to his residence outside the British concession. At the Japanese sentry line, we were forced to walk through a 50-foot-long muddy lane to the search shed. When we entered the search shed, a Chinese coolie was being searched. Mr. Holthus took off his hat, and I passed through without difficulty, quietly watching the puppet Chinese policeman search Mr. Holthus at the other end of the lane. While the Chinese policeman was searching him, a Japanese sentry sitting on a chair issued orders from time to time. Mr. Holthus was first ordered to take off his shoes and socks, and then to take off his clothes, which he did one by one without any objection. Finally, the Japanese soldier glanced at his pockets, and Mr. Holthus emptied all the contents of his pockets onto the ground. The Chinese policeman then pulled Mr. Holthus's trouser legs up to his knees and his shirt bottom up to his shoulders, as ordered by the Japanese sentry. He was then ordered to undo his trousers, and the Chinese policeman groped him arbitrarily. Only then was Mr. Holthus ordered to proceed. So Mr. Holthus began to retrieve all his clothes, socks, etc., and went to the exit to put them on. All these humiliating actions were carried out in front of a group of Chinese coolies waiting to pass through. According to Mr. Holthus, he has suffered the humiliation of strip searches four times since the British concession was blockaded. According to Mr. Holthus, the British Consul has asked British subjects not to enter or leave the concession unless necessary, so he plans not to return to the British concession in the next few days. Also, no matter who it is, when passing through the search shed, unless they have a special pass, they must get out of the car or rickshaw and walk to the search shed. This type of search shed was built by the Japanese a month ago, and at most only ten or so people pass through it in an hour. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

### Another Incident of Interference with British Ship Occurs

(Tianjin) Another major incident of interference with a British ship occurred today. The ship interfered with was the Ariadne Moller. The details of this matter will only be known for certain after the ship arrives at the British concession and the captain reports. It is heard that the ship arrived at Tanggu on Friday and, after being delayed for some time, sailed up the river and arrived at the riverside of the former German concession on Sunday morning. It is heard that the Japanese did not allow the ship to dock at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf for inspection but was forced to dock downstream. The ship was ordered to dock at the Dashut Steamship Company wharf, but the previous order was soon cancelled, and this happened several times. The food on the ship gradually ran out, and the fifteen foreign passengers, of whom only one was British, had nothing to eat from Sunday noon. Communication between the ship and the shore was also not permitted by the Japanese. Finally, the foreign passengers were notified that they could disembark at 1:30 am yesterday. What the fate of the 200 Chinese passengers will be is currently unknown. The ship has not yet arrived at the riverside of the British concession, but according to the shipping company, it will arrive this afternoon. It is heard that British Consul-General Jamieson has tried to persuade British firms not to let their British employees leave the concession. It is heard that several British subjects, including Mr. Holthus, who has repeatedly suffered the humiliation of being stripped, are currently on vacation. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### Japanese Plan to Develop Tanggu Port

Chinese newspapers report that the North China Liaison Department of the Japanese Koa-in recently announced a plan to develop Tanggu Port as a prelude to establishing Greater Tianjin, in order to reduce the importance of the British and French concessions as the financial center of North China. It is heard that the announcement of this plan is related to the Japanese blockade of the British concession. It is expected that when this plan is realized, the two Tianjin concessions will gradually lose their importance as the financial center of North China. According to Chinese sources, the plan includes modernizing the loading and unloading facilities in Special Area 1 (former German concession) and Special Area 3 (former Russian concession).

(Beijing) Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the British military attache in China who is currently being held by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou, recently sent a letter here, saying that the Japanese are providing him with food and books. Mr. Spear seems to be quite comfortable, but there is no sign of his release. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### U.S. Senate and House Pass Currency Act Extension for Two Years; Senate Passes Three Amendments; Stop Buying Foreign Silver; Abolish Presidential Devaluation Prerogative

(Washington) The powers enjoyed by President Roosevelt in currency matters (namely, the power to change the gold content of the dollar, to purchase domestic silver at a fixed price by the Ministry of Finance, and to establish an Exchange Equalization Fund of 2 billion US dollars) expire on the 30th of this month. The government has submitted a bill requesting an extension of the validity period for two years. The House of Representatives approved it on April 2nd. The Senate recently discussed the bill and passed it immediately, but with three amendments attached: (1) An amendment proposed by Colorado Democratic Senator Adams, abolishing the President's power to change the gold content of the dollar; (2) Regarding the price of domestic silver, which is set at 77.57 cents per ounce, Nevada Senator Pittman advocated setting it at 1.16 US dollars per ounce, but was rejected; (3) An amendment proposed by Colorado Republican Senator Townsend, prohibiting the Ministry of Finance from purchasing silver from abroad after the 30th of this month. In other words, the current silver purchase law will be abolished from the 30th of this month. Regarding this, Senate Democratic Leader Barkley delivered a speech before the vote, saying that the United States is purchasing silver from China and Mexico, and that these countries use the proceeds from selling silver to purchase goods from the United States. If this amendment is approved, the amount of American goods purchased by these countries will inevitably be reduced. At this moment, a certain country is trying to monopolize the international market. If you think that American goods do not need to be sold to Mexico and China, you may as well deprive these countries of their ability to purchase goods." After the Senate's discussion, Townsend's amendment was finally approved by a show of hands. Because the amendments passed by the Senate are very different from the original bill passed by the House of Representatives, the two houses will inevitably organize a joint committee to jointly formulate a unified clause. However, because the House of Representatives has not abolished the silver purchase law, the government can continue to purchase silver from abroad until the House of Representatives abolishes the law. However, according to observations from political circles, this law will inevitably be abolished. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

(New York) After the Senate decided to raise the price of domestic silver purchased by the Ministry of Finance from 64.64 cents per ounce to 77.57 cents, the Democratic New York Times recently criticized it, saying, "The result of the government's implementation of the silver purchase policy has artificially raised the price of domestic silver to 64.64 cents per ounce, which is 50% higher than the world market price, which is already inappropriate. How can the price be raised again? The silver purchase is originally a crazy move. Fortunately, the Senate has now decided to stop purchasing silver from abroad and only allow the purchase of domestic silver, which cannot be said to be completely devoid of common sense." (Havas dispatch, 26th)

(Washington) The U.S. Senate's cancellation of the silver purchase decree yesterday immediately suspended the government's silver purchase policy. The Senate's silver faction also united with conservatives, and by a vote of 40 to 30, limited the domestic silver price to 77.5 cents per ounce. The Senate also voted 47 to 31 to abolish President Roosevelt's prerogative to devalue the currency. The above two proposals were originally jointly proposed by Democratic Senators Pittman and Adams, but because the government firmly opposed them, they were not discussed in combination. Furthermore, the U.S. Currency Balance Fund will terminate supply this Friday, but yesterday's resolution had no effect on this. Observers here all believe that the U.S. government may make concessions to the silver group in order to restore the President's authority over the currency system. Yesterday, all Republican senators (except Senator Borah) adopted the same attitude as the silver faction and Democratic conservatives. Senator Pittman immediately proposed an amendment to change the silver price to 1.16 US dollars per ounce, but it was ultimately rejected by a vote of 26 to 52. According to sources from the silver group, a careful discussion should be made before the currency system bill is passed. According to this statement, it is actually intimidating those who intend to obstruct by delaying methods. Furthermore, according to Senate leaders, if the silver faction wants to extend the debate, a meeting will continue to be held tonight. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

### Mexico Greatly Shocked by the News; Fears Negative Impact on Political and Economic Aspects

Mexico City The relevant authorities in Mexico City were extremely shocked upon learning that the U.S. Senate had passed the Townsend Amendment, deciding to stop purchasing silver from abroad. However, they still hope that President Roosevelt can exercise his rights to veto it. Because silver sales account for a little less than one-third of the Mexican government's annual income, if the United States stops purchasing silver, the Mexican government will inevitably issue more paper money, reduce the value of the peso (Mexican currency name), and raise tax rates to compensate. After Mexico confiscated the oil mines of American merchants, the economic situation was already very difficult. If the above-mentioned measures are taken again, it will inevitably arouse public resentment and have a negative impact. Even from a political point of view, President C√°rdenas's political enemies, whether they belong to the right or the left, can take the opportunity to oppose the current government. The impact is difficult to foresee. People around President C√°rdenas recently said, "If the Townsend Amendment is implemented, not only will China be abandoned and fall into bankruptcy, but Mexico will also be controlled by the forces of Germany and Italy, and its market will be monopolized by Japanese goods. It is hoped that President Roosevelt will not allow it to be implemented." (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### U.S. Silver Purchase Statistics at Home and Abroad; China, Mexico, and India Provide the Most

(Washington) From the date the U.S. Treasury Department implemented the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 to the present, it has purchased silver from abroad worth 879,900,000 US dollars, of which Mexico, Canada, China, India, and Peru provided the most. In addition, the Treasury Department also purchased silver domestically worth 201,400,000 US dollars. The two numbers total 1,081,300,000 US dollars. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### U.S. Fiscal Deficit Last Year; Expenditures Unprecedentedly Large; National Debt Reaches 40 Billion

(Washington) The U.S. Treasury Department is preparing today to end its annual expenditures and revenues. It is said that the expenditures for this fiscal year are unprecedentedly large. The U.S. national debt will exceed 40,000,000,000 US dollars. Since 1931, the U.S. government has had a deficit every year, and it is feared that the balance of payments for the coming year will not be balanced either. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

### U.S. Neutrality Law Amendment; House Begins Debate; Repeal Embargo on Arms Clause; Isolationists Still Strongly Obstructing

(Washington) Regarding the Neutrality Law issue, the amendment proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom is scheduled to be submitted to the House for discussion tomorrow. The Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee recently held a secret meeting to study the contents of the bill and prepare for the debate by the Democratic members, hoping that the Bloom bill would be easily approved by the House. According to the knowledge of the members in the Congressional lounge, the members plan to cancel the clause in the Bloom bill authorizing the President to designate war zones and prohibit American merchant ships from entering war zones, and at the same time allow the repeal of the clause prohibiting the transport of arms to belligerent countries. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

(Washington) The amendment to the Neutrality Law proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, which advocates repealing the current embargo on arms clause, will be submitted to the House for discussion tomorrow. According to informed sources in political circles, if Congress has not voted on the new Neutrality Law when it adjourns for summer vacation, President Roosevelt may convene a special session of Congress to discuss it. At this moment, the State Department also insists that this bill must be concluded before Congress adjourns. In view of this, the Bloom bill can be approved by the House, but it is not yet known whether the Senate will pass it. Although there are only 20 or 30 senators opposing the Bloom bill, most of them are highly respected. Therefore, the strength of the opposition in Congress must be observed by the number of votes in favor and against after the House vote. At this moment, isolationists all say that if the war in Europe is unavoidable, then the United States will not be able to stop it. The key is to prevent the United States from being dragged into the vortex. Now President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull want the United States to immediately stand on the same front as the democratic countries in Europe, which is inappropriate. Those who support amending the current Neutrality Law firmly believe that the United States does have the power to prevent war, believing that if all aggressor countries know that once a war starts, the United States will provide material and spiritual assistance to Britain and France, they will naturally retreat in the face of difficulties. The best course of action now is to quickly amend the current Neutrality Law so that Chancellor Hitler can clearly understand the attitude of the United States, thereby contributing to the establishment of peace. The isolationist and government factions are deadlocked in this way. However, most of the American press supports amending the Neutrality Law, and only the newspapers belonging to the Hearst (American press tycoon) family still urge readers to exert pressure on Congress to reject the amendment proposed by Bloom. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

(New York) The Democratic New York Times recently published a commentary, saying that the current Neutrality Law must be amended according to the Bloom proposal so that the government can promote a diplomatic policy to reduce the crisis of a world war. The best way to eliminate war is to warn countries that are exhausted by soldiers and armed forces in time, so that they understand the opposing forces they will encounter, which occupy an absolute advantage. The position of the United States is extremely important. In other words, if we now officially inform these countries that the United States will provide resources for those who fight for self-defense, and at the same time, aggressor countries cannot control maritime traffic, they will not be able to obtain these resources. In this way, these countries will inevitably avoid war to avoid self-destruction. In this respect, the Bloom Amendment is sufficient to use the power of the United States to protect our country's security and to make our country's position and international law respected. Its contribution to eliminating war and establishing peace is by no means superficial." (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### U.S. Credit Loan to Portugal for a Total of 5 Million US Dollars to Purchase Railway Materials

### Britain Agrees to Lend Poland 20 Million Pounds; Poland Plans to Borrow 60 Million Pounds

(London) The Polish economic delegation came here to talk with representatives of the British Treasury Department, planning to borrow 60 million pounds from Britain to expand military equipment.

It is learned that the two sides are scheduled to meet again this afternoon, at which time the loan amount may be negotiated and finalized. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Britain Hastens Production of Military Uniforms; Cloth Length Reaches 2,000 Miles

(London) Many of the Yorkshire yarn factories in Britain are processing and weaving tea-colored cloth in preparation for the use of 2 million British conscripts, militias, and local troops. The length of the cloth can reach 2,000 miles, enough to stretch from the east coast to the west coast of the Atlantic. The labor cost for clothing will total 20 million US dollars. The War Department's contractor worked day and night for several days after Prime Minister Chamberlain announced the conscription. Civilian tailors are also cooperating with government contractors. Even at a speed of one shirt per minute, they still feel overwhelmed. At the same time, the War Department also needs to order other types of uniforms for other troops. Recent orders include 2 million yards of raw materials for cotton trousers covers to meet the needs of the Air Force, and 15 million yards of thick cotton cloth to meet the needs of the formal army. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

### If England and Japan Go to War, China and England Will Definitely Form an Alliance, and China's Resistance Will Definitely Be Strengthened: Radio Address by British Rear Admiral

(London) Former Director of Naval Intelligence, Vice Admiral Opens, recently delivered a radio address on the topic of "Pacific Defense Issues," stating that he believes if war breaks out between England and Japan, China will automatically become an ally of England and can be easily assisted through railway, air, and road transportation. As a result, China's resistance strength will certainly increase, and Japan, exhausted, will inevitably be defeated. Fortunately, both England and Japan are willing to resolve various disputes through agreements, so war between the two countries may not occur." In my opinion, England, France, and the United States should organize a conference in the Far East. When necessary, they can jointly send a note to Japan, which Japan would not dare to ignore. The combined military strength of the three countries is so powerful that Japan would not dare to provoke them. (Havas, 26th)

(London) According to Rear Admiral Oping, former head of naval intelligence, in a radio address today, if war breaks out between England and Japan in the Far East, England will surely win. "I firmly believe that after a war breaks out between England and Japan, China's resistance will certainly be strengthened, and as a result, Japan will collapse due to exhaustion. Even if a major war breaks out simultaneously in Europe, and the main force of the British Navy cannot but focus on Europe, we can still defeat Japan." At that time, the British Navy must first concentrate on Europe to resolve Germany and Italy, and then turn eastward to attack Japan. Therefore, at the beginning of a war between England and Japan in the Far East, the British Navy can only take a defensive posture based on Singapore, and will certainly be able to secure the area west of Singapore and Australia and New Zealand with ease. As for aid to China, it can also be provided continuously through the Burma Road, railways, and air transport. Therefore, England's victory over Japan is practically assured.

### European Crisis Looms Again: Germany Eager to Seize Danzig, Italian Army and Navy Busy with Autumn Maneuvers, British Navy Also Advances Exercises

(Paris) Diplomatic circles here recently received news from abroad that the major powers are actively engaged in military activities, no different from what they did before the repeated tensions in the European situation. It can be seen that the international situation will experience another crisis within a few weeks. This can be seen in the following events: (1) Before the signing of the German-Italian military alliance treaty, General Lidell, Commander-in-Chief of the German National Defense Forces, and Baliani, Deputy Minister of the Italian Army, held talks in Innsbruck. Recently, Admiral Reidel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, and General Gavaniari, Head of the Italian Navy, conducted talks in Friedrichshafen, Germany, to determine cooperation methods between the two navies. As for the cooperation between the air forces of both sides, General Goering, Minister of Aviation of Germany, is also conducting talks with General Vaye, Head of the Italian Air Force. (2) German-Italian military measures have been extended to Africa. General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, went to Italian Libya in North Africa to lay the foundation for joint German-Italian actions in North Africa. (3) General Batoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, recently went to Albania to inspect defense, and has now returned to Rome. After Albania was occupied by Italy, it has recently stationed 120,000 Italian troops. (4) The Italian Navy's First Fleet, including the battleships "Cavour" and "Caesar," ten cruisers, and more than twenty destroyers and torpedo boats, is conducting a "symbolic cruise" in the Atlantic Ocean. The Second Fleet will sail east on July 1, heading to Italian Libya, Albania, and the Aegean Sea. In effect, the entire Italian Navy is about to be mobilized. (5) The Italian Army will conduct large-scale exercises in the north. (6) The number of German Army personnel this summer will be 1.4 million. Along the German-Polish border, 200,000 workers are rushing to build fortifications. This is clearly a threat to the Free City of Danzig. The re-emergence of tension in the European situation can be seen from the above. (Havas, 26th)

(Berlin) The Danzig Vorposten, the organ newspaper of the National Socialist Party in the Free City of Danzig, recently issued an appeal to the city's residents, saying, "All my fellow citizens, in a short period of time, need to remain calm and united. This is essential today, because only after being united can we realize all necessary conditions and enable the citizens of Danzig to achieve their ultimate goal." (Havas, 27th)

Danzig: Preparations are underway here to organize irregular forces, which will be composed of the National Socialist Party Army and the Hitler Youth. Youths aged sixteen to twenty have been secretly dispatched to East Prussia and other parts of Germany for two weeks of rigorous training. The location of these youths is being carefully kept secret by the local authorities. However, these youths are expected to return here on July 1. Sixteen barracks are being built in the Free City and should be completed in time for use. (Reuters, 27th)

(London) The Admiralty recently issued a communiqu√© stating, "The summer leave for officers and men of the ships belonging to the headquarters fleet will be brought forward to July this year, so that these ships can enter dock in July for repairs. After completion, exercises can be held earlier in August. The ships sailing to certain places along the coast in mid-July has also been decided to be cancelled. Furthermore, Navy Week, which is held every year in early August, will also be cancelled this year." People in Parliament recently commented on this matter, saying, "According to news from Germany, the international situation in the second half of August this year is feared to become extremely tense again. The Admiralty authorities, in order to prepare for the worst, have decided to bring forward the date of the naval exercises (which were held in September last year). Only by being prepared to deal with the most dangerous situation can there be the greatest hope of safeguarding peace. Moreover, compared to last year, not only will the naval exercises be held earlier, but the total tonnage and armament of the British fleet have also increased significantly." People in naval circles do not believe that the early exercises of the British fleet have anything to do with the international situation, but diplomatic circles claim that "German politicians have recently made repeated fierce speeches, and the country's newspapers have repeatedly criticized Britain, and have made various allusions to the resolution of the Danzig Free City issue. The British government has therefore decided to take various steps to prepare for any eventuality." (Havas, 26th)

### Australia-Japan Trade Agreement to Expire Soon, No Plans to Renew

Canberra: Australian Minister of Commerce Paterson announced today that Australia and Japan do not intend to conclude a new trade agreement to replace the Australia-Japan trade agreement that expires on June 30. However, Japan has automatically undertaken to import two-thirds of its required wool from Australia, and will continue to inspect Japanese cotton cloth imported into Australia in accordance with the method since January 1937.

### Content of Newly Concluded French-Japanese Trade Agreement: French Goods Exported to Japan Must be Necessities Instead of Luxuries

(Tokyo) According to the new trade agreement signed by France and Japan on June 23, Japan will only purchase urgently needed necessities instead of luxuries.

France will purchase canned fish, porcelain, and cotton goods from Japan. (Reuters, 25th)

### Opening of the International Chamber of Commerce Conference: Attended by Representatives from Forty Countries, Totaling More Than 1,300 People

Copenhagen, Denmark: The 10th Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) was opened yesterday by the King of Denmark. 1,347 representatives from 40 countries attended. The conference chairman, Peterson, delivered the opening address, saying, "The ICC has been working hard for 20 years, moving towards its ultimate goal, and has made more progress than in its early stages. Although international trade and currency circulation have been frustrated due to political relations and restrictions on free competition, balancing the world economy will inevitably determine the future course of history. Therefore, the ICC should always hold this belief and move forward to achieve its goal." Then, the president of the conference, the American tycoon Watson, gave a speech saying, "Anyone who works for the future happiness and world peace will certainly not be in vain. It should be known that peace is a prerequisite for human happiness. All countries in the world should accept the responsibility of resolving international disputes for the happiness and security of all mankind, so that everyone can get what they need." (Haitong, 27th)

### British Undersecretary's Speech: Imperial Goal is to Create a New World

(London) Today is the second day of the conference held by the British Empire Press Union. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler attended and delivered a speech, saying, "Seeking peace is our first virtue. Therefore, the British Empire will never aim at aggression. To this day, we are not opposed to changing the status quo, but we are opposed to changing it by force. Moreover, the League of Nations covenant originally contained a clause for amending the status quo by peaceful means, but unfortunately, certain countries have never invoked or used it. As for our country's new policy, it has two major characteristics: one is strength, and the other is understanding. A balance must be struck between the two. Although we are determined to implement the new policy, we are not indifferent to new forces and new needs, nor will we seek temporary peace at any cost. Now, we have heard demands for establishing a new order in both the Far East and the West, but the goal of the British Empire is even greater than this. In other words, based on past experience and understanding of its own strength, as well as the understanding relations it maintains with various countries, it will establish a new world order, that is, create a new world amidst the current difficulties. This is indeed our urgent task. As for the establishment of an information department in the Foreign Office, our intention is not to use it as a propaganda factory, but as a photography studio to capture our true image and publicize it to all countries in the world." (Havas, 27th)

### British Authorities Discuss Promoting Talks with the Soviet Union: New Instructions Are Broad in Scope, Guarantee Issues Are Revised Again

(London) The Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee held a meeting at 6 PM today, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain himself, to discuss the progress of the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It approved the new instructions to Sir Seeds, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, which are said to be able to further advance the current negotiations, and the final agreement is also expected to be established. According to well-informed sources, the British government will make another revision of its views on mutual assistance methods, the inherent nature thereof, and the issue of guaranteeing other countries, in order to bring them closer to the Soviet Union's views. In other words: (1) Any neutral country whose preservation of independence is considered by one of the three signatory countries (Britain, France, and the Soviet Union) to be of vital importance, shall, in the event of aggression or the threat of aggression, automatically implement mutual assistance. (2) All countries, whether neutral or guaranteed by the three signatory countries, that indirectly benefit from the tripartite mutual assistance method should clearly indicate their names. Difficulties may arise in this regard, because the British government clearly intends to include Switzerland and the Netherlands in the list, but these countries do not maintain normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union may object, which is not necessarily certain. Ambassador Seeds submitted a lengthy memorandum to the government, requesting that significant concessions be made to the Soviet Union's demands, so that the British-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement could be completed quickly. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax made a thorough study of this memorandum this afternoon, and immediately drafted instructions, which were submitted to the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee for approval. Once the Cabinet approves the report, it will be sent to Ambassador Seeds by telegraph. According to sources close to the Foreign Office, the scope of the new instructions is quite broad, and Ambassador Seeds will not need to consult the government frequently when conducting negotiations with the Soviet authorities in the future. (Havas, 26th)

### Japanese Planes Cruelly Bomb Various Regions of Fujian Province; Fuzhou Bombed Daily for Nearly Half a Month; Yong'an and All Important Cities Are Harassed

Fuzhou Dispatch: For nearly half a month, the Japanese side has dispatched warships loaded with aircraft to bomb Fuzhou as many as three or four times each day, indiscriminately dropping incendiary bombs. Prosperous streets and important military shops have all been burned and destroyed, with losses amounting to as much as five or six million yuan. As for Jian'ou, Yanping, Yong'an, Tingzhou, Quanzhou, Tong'an, Haicheng, Nan'an, and other places, they have also been bombed repeatedly. Details are as follows:

(1) Jian'ou: At 9:00 AM on the 3rd, two Japanese planes, passing through Jianyang via Jiangshan on the border of Jiangxi, invaded Jian'ou. They first dropped six bombs outside the North Gate, all of which landed in empty spaces. Then, they dropped three bombs in the city. One landed on Xianpu Road, destroying four houses, killing two people, and injuring ten. Two landed in Chai Lane, destroying nine houses and killing three people. Four civilian houses on Dexin Street were also shaken down.

Six bombs were dropped in the third district of Haicheng, destroying four houses. The second time was at 12:00 PM when 13 bombs were dropped in Haicheng County Town, destroying more than ten houses. Then, three bombs were dropped in Jimei, Tong'an, all landing in empty spaces. The third time was at 4:00 PM when 17 bombs were dropped in Jimei, collapsing only a few houses.

(8) Yanping: At 7:30 AM on the 8th, four Japanese planes, taking off from a Japanese warship at the mouth of the Min River, passed through Fuzhou to Yanping, dropping 13 bombs, shaking down two classrooms of Nanping Middle School, injuring two students, two classrooms of Industrial Middle School, injuring three people, and killing one person with machine-gun fire at Mingcui Pavilion. Fuzhou was also subjected to two air raids on the same day.

(9) Yong'an (i.e., the new provincial capital of Fujian): At 8:00 AM on the 9th, seven Japanese planes, taking off from a Japanese warship in Xiamen, passed through Haicheng, Longxi, and Zhangping and invaded the urban area, dropping 13 bombs on the Normal School, the County Government Prison, the Post and Telegraph Bureaus, and outside the South Gate and West Gate, shaking down four houses of the Normal School, one house of the County Government Prison, and one post office, and bombing to death 11 prisoners and injuring six. Quanzhou was also subjected to two air raids on the same day. The first time was at 9:30 AM when four Japanese planes dropped ten bombs on Zhongshan Road, Shiba Wan, East Street, Hua Lane, and other places in the city, destroying more than 30 houses and killing or injuring more than 40 people. One of the bombs happened to land in an air-raid shelter in Shiba Wan, killing all twenty-plus people hiding inside, which was extremely tragic. Quanzhou Middle School and Mingtou Hall were also bombed and destroyed. The second time was at 1:00 PM when 12 bombs were dropped in Minglun Town, Zhongshan Road, and other places, destroying 13 houses, killing seven people, and injuring 12. Huiming Middle School and Chongfu and Kaiyuan, two ancient temples, were all destroyed.

(10) Quanzhou: At 8:30 AM on the 10th, 13 Japanese planes were spotted, taking off from a Japanese warship in Xiamen, dropping 35 bombs and five incendiary bombs on Minglun Town, South Main Street, Sanjiao Pu, Baiyuan Village, outside Tumen, East Gate Street, Datie Lane, and other places, destroying more than 100 houses and killing or injuring more than 40 people. The essence of the entire city was reduced to scorched earth. The Catholic Church, Chengtian Temple, and the First Building landmark were all bombed and destroyed, making it an unprecedented disaster for Quanzhou.

(11) Tingzhou: At 9:00 AM on the 10th, two Japanese planes, invading from the border of Jiangxi, dropped two bombs near the county government and two bombs near the county nursery, collapsing two houses, killing two people, and injuring three.

(12) Longxi, Haicheng, Shima, and Tong'an: From 12:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 12th, 24 Japanese planes, taking off from a Japanese warship in Xiamen, bombed in batches and in rotation, dropping a total of more than 50 bombs. However, because there were air raids from noon to evening without a break, long-distance telephone lines were disrupted, so the extent of the losses is unknown. It is only known that Haicang and Jiaowei in Haicheng, and Aotou and Liuwudian in Tong'an suffered severely. The provincial government, seeing that the air raids are becoming increasingly fierce, has ordered the county governments to immediately work with local agencies and charitable organizations to organize air raid emergency relief offices, establish refugee shelters to accommodate refugees whose houses have been destroyed by air raids and who have nowhere to go, and establish treatment centers to treat people injured by Japanese planes.

### Japanese Troops in Kunshan Head to the Front Lines to Fight; Forcibly Conscripting Civilians to Transport Supplies

Kunshan Dispatch: Recently, because the front lines are unfavorable, the Japanese troops stationed in the rear have been busy with troop movements, resulting in frequent transportation. The Japanese troops stationed in Kunshan are all reserves and have recently been ordered to depart. Before leaving, they forcibly conscripted civilians everywhere. Anyone drinking tea in tea houses or listening to storytelling in book halls was dragged away. For a time, the whole city was in turmoil, and people were panicking. It is estimated that over a hundred people were conscripted.

### The Bravery of Jinmen People's Restore Homeland and Save the Village Corps; Gathering in Lianjiang to Launch a Night Attack on Jinmen; Killing Over Forty Japanese Soldiers in One Night

Xiamen Dispatch: Jinmen has been occupied for a full year and a half. Jinmen people displaced in various places, seeing their homeland suffering all kinds of ravages, have organized the Restore Homeland and Save the Village Corps. The corps gathered on the evening of the 20th of April in Lianjiang, each person carrying rifles, Mauser pistols, and a large number of hand grenades, and boarded sailboats straight to Jinmen Island. They landed on the coast near Guanao and advanced in separate routes to encircle the Japanese garrison in Guanao and the Japanese artillery fort in Chengzi Corner. At about 2:00 AM that night, they first killed the Japanese sentries, cut off the telephone lines, and then threw hand grenades fiercely. Under the command of the brave Chen (name missing) and Lu (name missing), the corps leader and vice corps leader of the Jinmen Restore Homeland and Save the Village Corps, these brave men fought to be the first to charge. The Japanese soldiers, suddenly awakened by the sound of explosions, were panic-stricken. Over thirty garrison troops and a dozen artillery fort soldiers were annihilated in less than half an hour. These brave men seized the Japanese weapons and destroyed the artillery fort at Chengzi Corner, then calmly gathered, boarded the sailboats they had come on, and returned safely.

That day, over forty Japanese soldiers were annihilated, two light machine guns, over twenty rifles, and countless other spoils of war were seized. Among the rescue corps members, two bravely disregarded their own safety, resulting in heroic sacrifice. The annihilated Japanese soldiers belonged to a detachment of the "Sasebo Marine Corps Great Western Unit Second Company." The next morning, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Houpu, upon hearing the news, was ashamed and indignant. So, he sent troops to rescue on one hand and wired Xiamen for help on the other hand. However, when the Japanese troops from Xiamen and Houpu arrived one after another, they could only collect the remains of the Japanese soldiers, fire cannons at Dadeng and Xiaodeng to vent their anger.

### Ningbo Temporarily Suspends Navigation; Japan Blocks Foreign Ships from Sailing to Fujian and Wenzhou; British and American Authorities Firmly Refuse; Japan Must Take Responsibility If Civilians Are Endangered; Transportation Between Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou Is Cut Off

External News: The British authorities have refused the Japanese demand that British ships and British nationals withdraw from Fuzhou and Wenzhou. According to British officials, both places are commercial ports, and Britain naturally has the right to make full use of them. In the event that Japanese military actions endanger the lives and property of British nationals in those two places, the responsibility should be borne by Japan.

External News: Regarding the Japanese deadline for American ships in Fuzhou and Wenzhou to leave immediately and for American nationals to evacuate entirely by the 29th, it is now known that the commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Yarnell, intends to send a reply to the Japanese refusing the demand. The wording is the same as the reply refusing the Japanese demand in Shantou.

Since the fall of Dinghai, the Ningbo military authorities, in order to consolidate defenses, have decided to re-prohibit foreign ships from sailing. The Der Ping, Mou Fu, and New Peking ships all left Ningbo yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai that evening. However, there is a rumor that the Mou Fu ship has been permitted to continue sailing one more trip. In Wenzhou, foreign merchants were suddenly notified by the Japanese to obstruct foreign ships from entering the Ou River, causing the Ma Le En De, Bao Li, Fei Kang, and other ships to turn back to Shanghai midway. The Taikoo's Yingzhou, Liangzhou, and other ships have changed their route to Hong Kong. Details are explored below:

Ships from Ningbo Sail to Shanghai

Since the fall of Dinghai, Ningbo has become tense because of its proximity. Shipping circles in the city have been widely rumored that the Yong River would be re-closed to navigation. Until now, it has been learned that the Ningbo Defense Command has decided to temporarily prohibit navigation in order to strengthen the defense of the Zhenhai Estuary. A shipping company in the city, not having received an official telegram, sent a telegram the day before yesterday afternoon inquiring, saying, "Heard Ningbo will close navigation, is it true? Hope for a reply." Subsequently, at 8:00 PM that evening, a reply telegram was received from Ningbo stating, "Telegram received, prohibition of navigation is true, all ships staying in Ningbo are scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th." Therefore, the news of the prohibition of navigation has been confirmed. All foreign ships staying in Ningbo, such as the De Ping of Sino-Italian, the Mou Fu of Lihe, and the New Peking of Taikoo, left Ningbo before 6:00 AM yesterday morning and sailed to Shanghai, arriving in Shanghai one after another at around 7:00 PM that evening. However, according to news from the German merchant Lihe Yangxing, the Mou Fu ship of the company has been specially approved by the Ningbo authorities and may continue sailing one more trip. But whether it can sail depends on the decision in the Ningbo telegram.

Gap Unfilled

According to news from shipping circles yesterday, the closure of the Zhenhai Estuary this time is entirely for the purpose of consolidating the defenses of the fortress and is of the same nature as before. If the situation eases, it is hoped that it will be opened immediately. Therefore, the gap in the blockade line left for navigation will not be filled. The old Taiping ship, reserved to be sunk as a blockage, is still berthed at the Zhenhai China Merchants Bureau wharf and will not be sunk unless absolutely necessary. Because if it is blocked, it will be very difficult to open it in the future.

Two Ships Dock in Ningbo

The Gaodeng ship of the German merchant Lu Lin Yangxing, which travels the Ningbo-Dinghai route, sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 23rd. Because of the war there, it went straight to Shipu and has now returned to Ningbo from Shipu. Because Dinghai's transportation is blocked, it has decided to suspend navigation and dock in Ningbo temporarily. The Tianbao ship of the German merchant Shi Yide Yangxing is also temporarily docked and suspended. A decision on the route will be made after the Yong River is opened.

Japanese Obstruction

After the Japanese troops landed in Dinghai, they attempted to invade Zhenhai and the Ou River fortress. Yesterday morning, according to news from shipping circles, several Japanese warships were anchored outside the mouth of the Ou River, and aircraft were flying around. The German merchant John Mahler's ship was suddenly blocked from entering the Huanghua Customs Gate when it sailed out of the harbor yesterday morning. The ship had no choice but to turn back. At the same time, the Japanese naval authorities also notified foreign merchants, saying that the Japanese military would take action in the Ou River and Min Sea, and advised foreign merchant ships not to sail into the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian. Otherwise, if damage occurs, the Japanese side will not be responsible.

En De Turns Back

The Sino-Italian Company's En De ship was originally scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo on the afternoon of the 26th, but upon receiving news of the Ningbo navigation ban, it temporarily changed its course to Wenzhou yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, it suddenly received news of the Japanese obstruction yesterday morning, so it radioed the En De ship to return to Shanghai. After receiving the company's telegram, the ship turned back midway and entered the harbor at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The Fei Kang ship of the German merchant Lu Lin Yangxing and the Shi Li Yu ship of the Italian merchant Hua Yi Yangxing also sailed to Wenzhou at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, but both turned back midway. The Liangzhou and Yingzhou ships of the Taikoo Company have decided to change their route to Hong Kong. The Hana ship of the German merchant Far East Company left Wenzhou and returned to Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, and the Haifu ship of Lihe Yangxing arrived in Shanghai last night. Whether it can sail depends on the situation.

Japanese Attempt to Invade Chuanshan

Chuanshan is southwest of Dinghai, separated by a harbor two hours away by boat. It belongs to Zhenhai County and can be reached by land to Ningbo. Since the fall of Dinghai, the authorities have been stepping up preparations in the area to strengthen defenses and strictly guard against invasion. The harbor there is extremely narrow and the waterway is quite shallow, so Japanese warships cannot approach. Moreover, both sides are mountainous, and the Chinese side has strong fortifications and gun emplacements, so the defenses are extremely solid. According to a telegram received by shipping circles from Ningbo yesterday afternoon, over 300 Japanese soldiers, covered by three Japanese warships, attempted to land at Chuanshan yesterday morning. They were fiercely attacked by the local water police team, and the Japanese troops were wounded and retreated without success. However, the situation there is still extremely tense.

Destroying Highways

All coastal highways in eastern Zhejiang have been destroyed one after another due to military reasons, such as the Wenzhou to Qingtian section, the Ningbo to Cao'e section, the Cao'e to Xiaoshan section, the Ningbo to Chuanshan section, and the Jiangkou to Xikou section. The Ningbo Defense Commander has recently ordered the Fenghua and Xinchang County governments and the Yin-Feng Long-Distance Bus Company to prepare to continue the destruction upon orders. It is said that when necessary, all highways in Zhejiang Province will be destroyed at any time as required by military needs. Currently, the Lishui-Jinhua section via Yongkang and the Jinhua-Lanxi Longhai-Quzhou section are still open to traffic temporarily.

Situation in Zhoushan

According to reports from refugees who arrived in Shanghai from the Zhoushan Islands by sailboat, Shenjiamen in Dinghai was constantly bombed by six Japanese planes and shelled by Japanese warships on the morning of the 21st, causing considerable damage to the area. Subsequently, Japanese troops landed, and although the Self-Defense Corps and others resisted fiercely, they were ultimately defeated by the superior enemy and fell. It is said that the fall of Dinghai County Town was after Shenjiamen. Now, the Self-Defense Corps and others, led by County Magistrate Su, have retreated to the Qingling area to carry out guerrilla warfare and inflict heavy damage on the Japanese troops at any time. As for the residents, they have all withdrawn to the deep mountains in the suburbs, and the county town has become a ghost town.

Japanese Note

The English-language Great American Evening News reported that, according to news released by the Shanghai Consular Body, the Japanese naval authorities declared this morning (26th) that military action would begin today against the coastal ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou in Chinese hands, and requested that all foreign warships and merchant ships in the two places withdraw to designated areas by noon on Friday. Nationals of third countries residing in the two cities should evacuate as quickly as possible. The note delivered by the Japanese Navy to the Consular Body stated that after the above time, ships still anchored in the two ports may suffer direct or indirect losses, and the Japanese authorities will not be responsible. As of noon today, Shanghai had not received news of the Japanese declaration of military action against Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Fuzhou is the provincial capital of Fujian Province, recently relocated, and Wenzhou is a port in Zhejiang Province near the Fujian border, and is also the most important gateway for Chinese forces to enter the interior.

Ever since the Japanese troops landed in Shantou, the two cities have been quite tense. The Shanghai-Ningbo directËà™Á∂´, which had just resumed on Monday, has now been suspended. After the Japanese Navy occupied Zhoushan Island, Zhenhai and Ningbo will be invaded by Japanese troops at any time. It is believed that the Japanese troops will use the island as a base for invading Zhenhai and Ningbo, thereby completing their blockade of the Chinese coast. The Japanese military sent the following note to the Consular Body requesting foreign ships and foreign nationals to withdraw from Fuzhou and Wenzhou:

(1) On June 27, 1939, the Japanese Navy will begin military operations against Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Therefore, please have all third-country warships and merchant ships anchored in Wenzhou sail to the sea east of 112.15 degrees east longitude and those anchored in Fuzhou sail to 119.50 degrees east longitude before noon (Japanese time) on the 29th. For military needs, from the above time, the entrances to the two ports will be blocked with dangerous materials and other obstacles, so ships will not be able to enter or leave the two ports. After the above time, ships remaining anchored in the two ports may suffer direct or indirect losses, and the Japanese authorities will not be responsible. (2) Since the area near Wenzhou and Fuzhou will become a combat zone, please have the nationals of third countries residing in these areas evacuate as soon as possible.

British Authorities

are responding to this warning in the same way as the Shantou warning, stating that the Japanese side is responsible for not interfering with the actions of British ships or endangering the lives and property of British citizens. The British government cannot accept this warning as a means for the Japanese side to shirk its above-mentioned responsibility, because British ships, including warships, have the right to sail to any point on Chinese waters and to anchor in all commercial ports, and the right of British citizens to reside near Wenzhou and Fuzhou is not affected.

### American Nationals Enthusiastically Celebrate the American National Day

### Approved Tram Fare Increase by the Shanghai Municipal Council: First Class: National Currency 3.1 Cents Per Mile, Third Class: National Currency 2.15 Cents Per Mile ‚Äì An Increase of Approximately 16.6% Over the Original Price

The Shanghai Tramways Company submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council in April of this year to approve an increase in fares. It is noted that the company's last fare increase was implemented in June 1933. The fares set at that time, after being converted to national currency at the average exchange rate in March 1937, were equivalent to 2.67 cents of national currency per mile for first class and 1.84 cents of national currency per mile for third class. According to the contract between the company and the Shanghai Municipal Council, there was a clause stipulating that the maximum fare would be 10 cents per mile for first class and 5 cents per mile for third class.

Decline in Exchange Rates, Increased Costs

The company stated that the proposed fare increase was necessitated by the sharp decline in the exchange rate of the national currency and the significant increase in operating costs in the year prior to April of this year, making it unavoidable. The Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council discussed this matter in detail on May 19 of this year.

Public Utilities Committee Approved

Some committee members stated that the most important factor to consider regarding this proposal was the company's financial situation and whether an increase in fares was necessary. It was jointly decided that the increase in operating costs and the proposed fare increase did not exceed the contract limits. Others stated that the proposed fare increase of 16.6% over the original price was reasonable and that, according to the company's business charter established on October 10, 1930, the company seemed to have the right to increase fares to the maximum limit without the need for approval from the Council. Subsequently, the committee resolved to seek legal advice regarding the authority issue. As for the proposed fares, the majority of the committee members approved them.

Expected Revenue After the Price Increase

According to the legal advice obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Council afterward, the Tramways Company, based on its business charter, could increase fares to the maximum limit. Regarding the company's income and expenditure situation, the Chief of the Finance Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council conducted a detailed investigation and reported to the Board of Directors. The Chief stated that, to his knowledge, the expected increase in revenue after the Tramways Company implemented the price increase would only be able to offset 80% of the increased expenses.

Tramways Company Statement

At a meeting held last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors submitted the recommendations of the Public Utilities Committee, along with the opinions and detailed reports of the Chief of the Finance Department, for review. It was decided to instruct the Chief of the Finance Department to write to the Tramways Company again to inquire about various facts and figures in order to determine whether the proposed fare increase was justified. The company then replied to the Chief of the Finance Department, stating that the company had always adopted a business policy of charging low fees to cater to the public. The large number of tram passengers showed that the public agreed with the company's fares. Since the last fare increase, the company's operating costs have increased significantly. In the past two months, the exchange rate of British gold has risen from 7 and 32/7 pence to 7 and a half pence, further increasing expenses. The company did not want to increase the burden on passengers, as an excessive fare increase would reduce the number of passengers, which would be detrimental to the company's interests.

Tram Fares in Various British Cities

The proposed revised fares, when converted at an exchange rate of one national currency yuan to six and a half British pence, would be 20% of one penny per mile for first class and 14% of one penny per mile for third class. In comparison, the tram fares per mile in Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester in the United Kingdom are 65%, 50%, and 72% of one penny, respectively. The company had carefully considered the fare increase, which is why it had been delayed until now before implementing it. At the same time, the company submitted a report on its assets, liabilities, income, and expenditure for the past six years.

Approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors

After reviewing the above documents, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors raised the Tramways Company's request for discussion again on the 14th of this month. The directors all believed that the proposed revised fares were fair and reasonable, and they unanimously resolved to approve the company's increase of the average fare to 3.11 cents of national currency per mile for first class and 2.15 cents of national currency per mile for third class.

New Fares to Be Implemented Tomorrow

According to a news agency, the Shanghai Tramways Company has recently decided to revise its ticket prices due to the decline in exchange rates and high expenses. It is now learned that the company has finalized the new fares and will officially announce them tomorrow (the 29th), posting them on all vehicles. Passengers will also be required to pay the new fares when riding.

### The Body of a Secretary at the Nanjing Japanese Consulate Transported to Japan: Miyashita and Funayama Died of Poisoning

The Japanese Consulate-General in Nanjing invited Japanese and puppet personnel to a banquet on the 10th of this month. During the banquet, someone secretly placed poison in the wine, resulting in the poisoning of many Japanese and puppet personnel. As a result, two secretaries from the consulate, Miyashita and Funayama, died despite efforts to save them. Their bodies have been transported to Shanghai. At 9 a.m. yesterday, the coffins were carried onto the Japanese ship "Shanghai Maru," which set sail from the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou to return to Japan. At the time, a large number of Japanese and puppet personnel were at the wharf, holding half-masts to hold a send-off ceremony. The surrounding area was guarded by Japanese soldiers to prevent accidents, and the situation was quite tense.

### Total Amount of Silver and Money Exchange Transfer Certificates Provisionally Set at 50 Million: Registration to Begin Immediately, Implementation Scheduled for July 4th

In order to regulate the capital of the same industry in Shanghai and meet the needs of industry and commerce, the Silver and Money Exchange Association will handle the issuance of inter-bank transfers, with a total amount provisionally set at 50 million yuan. Registration will begin immediately, and implementation is scheduled for July 4th. A letter has been sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to send personnel to jointly form a transfer preparation inspection committee. The details are as follows:

Evaluation Price for Receiving Transfers

It is stipulated that member banks and money exchanges of the Silver and Money Exchange Association, as well as member banks of the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, note exchange banks, and trust companies, can provide property, including major goods, corporate bonds, stocks, real estate in the concession, etc., to the Bank Joint Reserve Committee to receive inter-bank transfers. The committee will evaluate the prices and issue transfer certificates. The evaluation committee members are divided into real estate shares, securities and stock shares, and goods shares. The committee members are appointed by Chinese and foreign experts.

Formation of Inspection Committee to Handle Registration

The Inter-Bank Transfer Preparation Inspection Committee is jointly organized by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Banks Association, the Bankers Association, and the Money Exchange Association, each sending one representative, and the Sino-Central-Jiaotong-Nong four banks jointly sending one representative. The association has already sent letters to the above organizations and the four banks to promptly send representatives. The task is to inspect the collateral provided by the banks and money exchanges for receiving the transfer. At the same time, the association has started handling the registration of inter-bank transfer receipts, which will be implemented on July 4th.

Transfer Deposits Converted into Legal Tender

Since the Ministry of Finance allowed the Sino-Central-Jiaotong-Nong four banks to provide silver and money exchanges with legal tender as much as possible, it is reported that the Bank Joint Reserve Committee has reached an agreement with the Sino-Central-Jiaotong-Nong four banks. The 22 million yuan of transfer deposits originally deposited by the silver and money exchanges in the Bank Joint Reserve and the Money Exchange Reserve will be converted into legal tender by the Bank Joint Reserve at 95% starting from July 4th, in twelve weeks, to facilitate turnover. It is reported that the association has notified the banks and money exchanges that hold the deposits.

Increased Chips Beneficial to All Industries

A reporter from New Sound News learned from the silver and money exchanges yesterday that after the bank's semi-annual settlement, two types of chips have been added to the Shanghai market: one is a new transfer chip with definite collateral, and the other is the transfer of existing deposits in warehouses, which has become a legal tender chip. Although the new transfer method is a new chip in Shanghai, it can prevent the market from feeling a lack of chips, which is very beneficial to industry and commerce. At the same time, it can make the entire financial market more stable and reduce improper speculation.

Collateral is Reliable and Circulates in the Market

Regarding the issue of silver and money exchanges issuing 50 million yuan of new transfer chips, a reporter from New New News visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association, yesterday. He said that the Bank Joint Reserve Committee is determined to handle the issuance of new inter-bank transfers for various banks and money exchanges entirely to regulate inter-bank funds and meet the needs of industry and commerce. All receiving banks and money exchanges must provide reliable property as collateral, and the transfer received must not exceed 70% of the evaluated value of the collateral, so as to ensure that the collateral is sufficient. The transfers can be used as chips for transactions and transfers in industry and commerce, circulate in the market, and can be transferred inland to purchase local goods.

Issuing Circulating Notes is Absolutely Not Accurate

The silver and money exchanges' reserve fund is allowed to exchange inter-bank transfer deposits for legal tender and handle inter-bank receipts of transfers, all of which are scheduled to be implemented after the semi-annual settlement holiday, that is, from July 4th. Therefore, the legal tender chips in Shanghai can be increased by 22 million yuan and 50 million yuan of new transfer certificates, totaling 72 million yuan. In addition, the number of legal tender and transfers currently circulating in the market is also quite large. In the future, the turnover of chips for banks and money exchanges themselves and for industry and commerce will not be lacking. The rumor that the authorities will issue circulating notes due to restrictions on deposits and withdrawals and a shortage of legal tender has been confirmed by authoritative sources in the financial community to be absolutely inaccurate.

### Tianjin Incident Captivates World Attention: More News Released Daily Than During the Shanghai War: Well-Known Foreign Reporters in This City Rush to North China

The Continental Daily reported that the Overseas Telegraph Company and newspapers were calling for newsÁ®ø‰ª∂ from Tianjin. The North China city had become the number one news source in the world. More news about this matter was being released from China daily than was being released from Shanghai during the most intense fighting around Shanghai in September 1937. The increasing tension in Tianjin has caused well-known news reporters to quickly leave this city. Miles, the Far East General Manager of the Associated Press, went to the blockaded city last week. Steele of the Chicago Daily News, after arriving here from India, rushed to Tianjin last Saturday. Kane, a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, also left Shanghai by train for the north last Sunday.

### Japanese Warships Bombard to Provide Cover: Intense Fighting in Xingang

Chinese Troops Bravely Repel Japanese Troops, Who Retreat to Their Ships: Swire & Co. Decides to Suspend the North Shasa Route

For days, the Japanese Navy has been sending warships to bombard various ports in Haiqi County in an attempt to cover the landings and hinder the passage of foreign ships. Swire & Co., a British company, has decided to suspend the North Shasa route. Foreign ships sailing today will temporarily not call at Xingang and other places. The details are as follows, as reported by a reporter from Dagong News Agency:

Japanese Warships Continue to Bombard Xingang

A Japanese small shallow-water gunboat, No. 32, arrived at Erlishu waters outside Xingang Port the day before yesterday (the 26th) and continued to bombard the shore to cover two motorboats carrying more than 30 soldiers, equipped with machine guns, rifles, and other weapons, in an attempt to land. When the Japanese soldiers on the boats approached the port, they fired with machine guns and rifles. The Chinese troops on the shore immediately returned fire. For a time, the sound of cannons was deafening, bullets flew everywhere, and the fighting was intense. As a result of the battle, due to the tight defense of the Chinese troops, the Japanese troops retreated to their ships, and the landing attempt still failed.

Ships Sailing to North Shasa Are Blocked from Sailing

The Wantong Wheel of the British Swire & Co., the Haiyi Wheel of the German Far East Co., and the Jiangding Wheel of the Fuhua Co., all sailing on the North Shasa route, sailed out on the morning of the 26th. At about 2 p.m., they arrived near Xingang and were spotted by Japanese warships, which immediately signaled them to stop and blocked them from advancing. The Haiyi and Jiangding wheels then sailed back to Qinglong Port and dropped anchor. The Wantong wheel, protected by the British warship "Mosquito," sailed with it to Xingang and anchored. Although it sounded its whistle, the boatmen did not dare to risk going out of the port to pick up passengers. At about 5 a.m. yesterday morning, when the Wantong wheel sailed to Lingdian Port, it suddenly discovered two Japanese motorboats following closely behind the ship, firing guns at the shore. The ship stopped. At about 10 a.m., when the Japanese motorboats left, it sailed straight to Sanhe and docked. The boatmen risked going out of the port and unloaded passengers and goods. Only a dozen passengers took the ship from the port to Shanghai. A small number of passengers on the Haiyi and Jiangding wheels disembarked at Qinglong Port, and the majority of the passengers and cargo were brought back to Shanghai by the original ships. All the ships arrived in Shanghai at around 3 p.m. yesterday.

Japanese Consulate Notifies Wantong to Suspend Navigation

At the request of the naval authorities, the Japanese Consulate notified the British Consulate yesterday that there were military operations in the lower ports of North Shasa and that all ships were prohibited from sailing. The British Consulate informed the British Swire & Co. accordingly. A reporter from Dagong News Agency learned that the company has temporarily suspended the Wantong wheel's voyage on the North Shasa route and will decide whether to resume the voyage depending on the situation.

German Ships Still Operate, Do Not Call at Upper Ports

According to a reporter from Dagong News Agency who inquired last night, the Haiyi wheel of the German Far East Co. and the Jiangding wheel of the Fuhua Co. will still sail to Shuji Hong, Niuhong Port, and Hutong Port as usual at 7 a.m. this morning. However, if they are blocked by Japanese warships, they will temporarily take Qinglong Port as the end point and will not call at Xingang, Lingdian Port, Sanhe Port, and other upper ports. Since the Anti-Japanese War, passengers and goods in northern Jiangsu have been transported through the above three ports. If they are blocked by the Japanese army, the daily necessities in this city will be slightly affected.

### Rumor That Japanese Troops Landed in Minjiang River: No Telegrams Received in Shanghai: Shenfu Wheel Scheduled to Arrive in Fuzhou Yesterday, Niuzhuang Wheel Temporarily Changed Its Route

After Hong Kong telegrams reported that the Japanese Navy had landed at the Jianfeng area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMinjiang River in Fujian yesterday morning, a reporter from New Sound News inquired from the shipping industry yesterday, but no telegrams were received from Fuzhou. It was found that the Minjiang River in Fuzhou had already been blocked, and the blockade line was at the Mawei in Minjiang River. Therefore, all foreign ships sailing to Fuzhou were anchored at Panshi outside Mawei. Mawei is the only military port, with new-style fortresses and defense works.

No Telegrams from Fujian Shipping Companies to Confirm

The British Yilong Co.'s Shenfu wheel loaded goods in Shanghai and sailed to Fuzhou on the 25th of this month, scheduled to arrive in Fuzhou yesterday. However, as of last night, the Shanghai company had not received a telegram from the wheel or from the Fuzhou branch. Therefore, the rumor of the Japanese army landing was considered difficult to confirm.

Niuzhuang Wheel Changed to Directly Release to Haifang

The British Swire Co.'s Liangzhou and Niuzhuang wheels were originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to the newly opened Xiudu, Linqiu, and Sanjiang ports near Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Xiangyu in Fujian Province this morning. Yesterday morning, there were rumors that the Japanese army had landed near the Minjiang River. After learning of the above news, Swire Co. changed the route of the Niuzhuang wheel and changed it to directly release to Haifang on the morning of the 30th (Saturday).

Xiudu Route Temporarily Takes a Wait-and-See Approach

As for the Liangzhou wheel, which was originally scheduled to sail to Xiudu (Hsintu) (i.e., Xiudu near Quanzhou) this morning, the passengers and goods that had been booked yesterday were being loaded. Because the route was difficult to change for a while, for safety reasons, we will wait and see for another day today. If there are no major changes, we will prepare to export tomorrow morning and try to sail to Xiudu.

### Situation in North China Gradually Tense: British and American Flagships Concentrated: American Ship OÂÖãÊñØÊ≥∞ Arrived in Yantai, British Ship Kant is Rushing North

After the Tianjin Concession was blockaded, the situation in North China suddenly became tense. Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Asian Fleet, had already taken the flagship Â••Âè§ÊñØÊ≥∞Ëôü from Qinhuangdao to Yantai on the 26th. The British warship "ÈÇìËÇØ" also sailed from Qinhuangdao to Yantai on the same day following the American ship Â••Âè§ÊñØÊ≥∞Ëôü. It is also learned that the reason why the British warships sailed to Yantai was due to the request of the British Consul in Yantai, because the anti-British incidents there were on the rise. Also, the British Far East giant ten-thousand-ton flagship "ÂùéÁâπ" (KENT) departed from Singapore for China on the evening of the 26th and is currently en route to North China. It is said that it will go to Yantai for concentration. Admiral Noble, Commander of the British Far East Fleet, may still remain in Singapore to meet with Australian Naval Minister Goree, so the date of his return to China will be delayed accordingly. The "ÂùéÁâπ" is equipped with eight 8-inch guns.

### Fierce Anti-British Actions in Qingdao

The Continental Daily reported that when Jardine Matheson's Chun Sheng wheel berthed in Qingdao last week, longshoremen instigated by the Japanese displayed a portrait of British Prime Minister Chamberlain, shouting "Down with Chamberlain" and "Resist British Goods," causing the wheel to be unable to unload and stay in Qingdao for four days. This was told to the reporter by Captain Kegongks when the Chun Sheng wheel arrived here yesterday (26th) at noon. The dockworkers also held a mass rally and demonstration, severely criticizing Britain and the British, and used a portrait of Chamberlain to arouse greater excitement. During the four days, whenever coolies were hired to unload goods for the Chun Sheng wheel, someone would persuade them to unload goods for the Japanese wheel. It is also learned that the Taikoo Co.'s Shengjing wheel returned here from Tianjin and other ports in North China at 6:30 a.m. yesterday morning. It is said that the wheel was not obstructed by the Japanese.

### Scarce Arrivals, Slack Sales: Total Rice Stockpile Unchanged: Decrease in Stockpile is Due to Citizens' Scattered Hoarding of Rice: Rice Management Committee Held Another Meeting Yesterday to Discuss

The Concession authorities have repeatedly taken measures to stabilize the people's food and curb the rise in prices within the Concession, and have sent detectives to intervene. Rice prices have fallen slightly. Now, the Concession Rice Management Committee, in order to stabilize people's hearts, convened a committee meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday. It is reported that the result of the discussion can be divided into the following three points: 1. To stabilize the people's hearts in the market, it is necessary to dredge the source of national rice. 2. Send personnel to the market to persuade each other to buy and sell at the limited price according to the license. 3. Reward the Bang merchants and encourage them to purchase national rice and transport it to Shanghai for regulation. It is reported that rice sales have been slack in recent days.

Although Stockpiles Have Decreased, There is No Shortage of Food

A reporter from New Sound News learned from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association yesterday that the 13th rice stockpile survey was released yesterday. The total rice stockpile in the city's rice warehouses was 436,427 bags, a decrease of 87,395 bags compared to last week. According to rice industry news, the reason for the decrease in the stockpile of more than 80,000 bags is that citizens rushed to buy and hoard rice during the recent surge in rice prices. Although the current stockpile has decreased, there is no shortage of food for the whole people, because the rice stored in the rice shops and the rice hoarded by the citizens is estimated to be around 50 to 60 million bags.

### Jin Yushu Embezzlement: The First Special Court Sentenced Him to Two and a Half Years and Ordered Him to Return the Embezzled Funds

Jin Yushu, a former accountant of the Nanliang Deseguo Foreign Company, successively embezzled public funds amounting to 24,350 yuan and fled. The company filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the former Capital District Court and issued an arrest warrant. Recently, detectives from the Old Zhabei Police Station arrested Jin and escorted him to the First Special Court. Due to the issue of jurisdiction, the First Special Court requested instructions from the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court. Now the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Special Court has jurisdiction. Therefore, yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei opened a criminal court to interrogate him. The lawyer of the Police Station, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted him for embezzlement. The defendant had no objection to the prosecution's claims and requested a judgment according to law. The lawyer representing Deseguo stated that Jin Yushu had already returned 5,000 yuan, so the incidental civil suit should be corrected to 19,350 yuan and the statutory 5% interest until the date of execution, etc. Judge Xiao sentenced Jin Yushu to two years and six months of imprisonment and ordered him to return 19,350 yuan of national currency to the plaintiff, and 5% interest until the date of execution.

### Geneva Collects National Products for Display: Increase International Trade Efficiency: The Chinese International Library Museum Department Sends a Letter to the Manufacturers Association to Collect Samples

The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association received a letter from the Chinese International Library in Geneva yesterday: "We are writing to inform you that our library was established in Geneva, the international center. Its main purpose is to promote national glory and enhance China's international status. For six years, we have spared no effort in providing books, exhibiting calligraphy and paintings, distributing magazines, and holding lectures, and the results have been great. Last autumn, we expanded our plan and organized a Museum Department to become a parallel institution with the existing library, so that our country's cultural relics can be permanently displayed overseas to promote Westerners' understanding of us and change their past misconceptions about our race. Since the Anti-Japanese War, we have stepped up our publicity. In view of the popularity of Japanese goods in Europe and the United States, we think there must be a way to control them. We have set up a National Products Department to promote our national products in Europe and the West, so that Westerners can distinguish the exquisiteness of our Chinese goods, which are far superior to Japanese goods, so as to increase the efficiency of our country's international trade. Reading the newspaper, we know that your association is holding a National Products Exhibition in Shanghai. We admire your grand plans. We are thinking, if your association could collect a copy for our library at the same time, regardless of the nature or category, and display them separately with explanations for publicity purposes, it would be beneficial to both the public and private sectors. If you agree to this, it would not only be a blessing for our library, but also for the future of our motherland's foreign trade. Please divide each item into small packages and send them to our library as samples. If the weight is too large and you need to pack them in large boxes, to avoid taxes, please send them to the office of our country's League of Nations representative, stating that you are forwarding them to our library. Please consider and reply."

### Wang the Taoist Turns Bandit, Extorting Money by Intimidation, Arrested After Failure

Wang Xingbao, a Taoist priest, 31 years old, residing at No. 147 Li Mei Road, on the 22nd of this month at 5:30 AM, gathered Qiu Sanzi, a Jiangbei native, and the fugitive nicknamed "Rotten Wood," carrying a pistol and two sharp blades, and went to the home of the blind fortune teller Wang Wenlong at No. 46 Li Mei Road to commit robbery. They robbed nine pieces of clothing. Unsatisfied, Wang Xingbao sent Wang an intimidating letter on the 24th, demanding 500 yuan and setting the time for negotiation at 7 AM the next day at Gansu Road in the Public Concession. After receiving the letter, Wang sent Shao Linfu as a representative to negotiate with the bandits on the one hand, and reported it to the French police on the other. Inspector Li Xianyang, detectives Zhou Bingcheng, Wang Dongwan, Zhou Qingfang, Yang Jiaxue, and others disguised themselves and accompanied Shao. Upon arriving at the designated location, they found the Taoist priest Wang standing by the roadside, seemingly waiting. Shao pretended to negotiate with Wang, and the bandit Qiu also staggered over. The detectives rushed forward, captured the two bandits, and took them to the police station for investigation. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for trial by Judge Zhang Minsheng. The police requested an extension of the hearing because the case was not yet fully investigated. After a brief interrogation, the court ordered a rescheduling for further trial.

### Truck Railing Breaks, Female Workers Injured

The Pinghe Warehouse at No. 248 Qinhuangdao Road, Yangshupu Road, Hongkou, has a large number of male and female workers who are transported by the warehouse's own trucks. Yesterday at 5:39 PM, dozens of female workers were riding in a small truck, departing from the warehouse to take them home. Unexpectedly, the truck was small and overcrowded. When passing the intersection of Macleod Road, one side of the wooden railing broke due to excessive vibration. Thirteen female workers near the railing, Chen Lanying (20 years old), Jiang Wangshi (50 years old), Jin Achun (48 years old), Zhang Jinshi (58 years old), Xu Fangshi (26 years old), Zhou Feishi (24 years old), Xia Xiufeng (24 years old), Yao Chenshi (46 years old), Yao Xiuying (20 years old), Zhou Lingdi (28 years old), Yang Shenshi (42 years old), Gong Shenshi (47 years old), and Tang Geshi (30 years old), were thrown out and suffered injuries to their faces, chests, hands, and feet.

### Procuress and Pimp Punished for Extortion

Liu Gendi, a woman from Yixing (18 years old), lost both parents at a young age and was impoverished. She came to Shanghai this spring to find work in a yarn factory but was unsuccessful. She stayed at the Rue de Saigon Refugee Shelter. Recently, the shelter closed down, and Liu had nowhere to live, becoming a beggar, sleeping in the alleys. Later, two elderly women who were previously at the shelter took her to a brothel at No. 8 Zhifu Road, opened by Hu Peizhen from Zhenjiang and her concubine Wang Guibao from Changzhou, forcing her into prostitution. For about ten days, Liu suffered from urinary problems, and the procuress Wang Guibao ordered the ruffians Jin Linbao from Shaoxing and Jin Asan from Ningbo to take her to Shi Shiquan, a fellow villager and owner of Zhengji Teahouse on Xiaoshadu Road, on the 20th at 8:30 PM. The two Jins took the opportunity to extort Shi, falsely accusing him of introducing Liu to Wang Guibao's brothel to become a prostitute, demanding 200 yuan to settle the matter. The case was exposed, and the police from Putuo Road dispatched Chinese detective Tan Jinhai to arrest the two Jins. After learning the details, he went to No. 8 Zhifu Road to arrest the two brothel owners, Hu and Wang, and sent them all to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Criminal Court sentenced Hu Peizhen and Wang Guibao to two years and six months each, and Jin Linbao and Jin Asan to six months each, as a warning.

### Japanese National Expelled for Involvement in Opium Sales Rights

The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 26th), a Japanese newspaper in this city reported that two more Japanese nationals, involved in a transaction related to opium sales rights, have been ordered to be expelled by the Japanese military authorities.

### Wang Jiasun and His Brother Falsely Accuse Xu Maochang, Police File Public Prosecution

Xu Maochang, a wealthy Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, has been involved in lawsuits in recent years. Initially, he was accused by Viennese dancer Jiang Yuzhen of seduction and abandonment, and was also implicated in the yarn exchange scandal. More recently, he has been sued in civil and criminal cases in the First Special District Court, and a lawsuit involving adultery with a Ms. Yang has turned into a family scandal. Thus, Xu has been spending his days dealing with lawsuits. Now, a dispute has arisen with Wang Jiasun and Wang Jiatong, directors of the Chengji Real Estate Company.

The Background of the Conflict: Wang Yang'an, the father of Wang Jiasun and Wang Jiatong, and Xu Qingyun, the father of Xu Maochang, were both from the same hometown and were friends. Xu Qingyun's Henglai Money Exchange, located in Xingren Lane, Ningbo Road, has now declared bankruptcy, and both Xu Qingyun and Wang Yang'an have passed away. Recently, Xu Maochang suddenly claimed that Wang Yang'an had invested 30,000 yuan in Henglai Money Exchange when he was alive, but did not come forward. Therefore, Wang Yang'an's successors, Wang Jiasun and Wang Jiatong, should also bear the

Responsibility for the Debt

and brought the matter to the Wang brothers. The Wang brothers denied any knowledge that their ancestor had invested 30,000 yuan in Henglai and refused to take responsibility. Thus, the dispute arose. On the 20th of this month, Wang Jiasun, representing Wang Jiatong, reported to the Old Gate Police Station, stating that Xu Maochang, on the morning of the 19th around 11:00 AM, had led four or five people to the Chengji Real Estate Company at No. 457 Hankou Road, threatened them with a pistol, and robbed 30 account books, requesting investigation. After

Investigation by

Chinese detective Tao Rubi and Western detective, Xu Maochang claimed that the account books were taken from Wang Jiatong's house at No. 557 Route des Soeurs, were voluntarily handed over, and that a receipt was issued by the accompanying lawyer Zhang Zhiguo, and that there was no pistol threat. The detectives determined that the Wang brothers had made a false accusation and petitioned the First Special District Court to

Issue a Summons.

Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen opened the First Criminal Court to summon them. Wang Jiatong, due to illness, sent lawyer Liu Shifang to court to make a statement, while Wang Jiasun surrendered himself. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated the details of the case and prosecuted the two Wangs for the crime of false accusation under Article 169 of the Criminal Law, stating that since the defendant Wang Jiatong had not appeared in court, the case could not be concluded immediately and requested a postponement. After Judge Xiao interrogated Xu Maochang and Wang Jiasun, he ordered a postponement for further interrogation.

### Apprentice Kills a Man, Sentenced to Seven Years in Prison

Jiang Genshan, a 22-year-old from Yancheng working at the Dafeng Shoe Store at No. 522 Yidingpan Road, went to Yun Jisheng, a fellow villager working at No. 1292 Caoxiebang, Robison Road, at 8:40 AM on the 18th of this month, and started a fight over a debt of two yuan. He injured Yun's abdomen with his fists, causing intestinal and spleen rupture. Yun died after being sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the incident was reported, the Putuo Police Station arrested and sent Jiang to the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Criminal Court, after investigation, sentenced Jiang Genshan to seven years in prison as a warning.

### Pimp Punished for Robbery

Sun Achang, a 52-year-old from Shaoxing, had committed offenses multiple times in the past. Recently, he worked as an assistant in a brothel at No. 8 Qunyufang, Shantou Road, and thus became acquainted with Gong Caidi (25 years old), the landlady of Yunniang's bookshop at No. 22 Huile Lane, Sima Road. On the 1st of this month, Sun Achang suddenly had inappropriate thoughts and, impersonating a Mr. Yang, sent a note to Gong Caidi, summoning her to Room 504 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Using threats, he forced her to live with him. When she refused, he robbed her of a gold bracelet worth over 200 yuan. After the report, detective Zhang Bingchun was dispatched to arrest Sun and send him to the First Special Court. After the interrogation, Judge Xiao sentenced Sun to one year and two months in prison yesterday.

### Wan Chen Sauce Garden Dispute, Shareholder's Embezzlement Case Concluded

Wan Chen Sauce Garden was formerly located at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Lujiawan. On April 22nd of this year, Li Runshen, the shareholder and manager of the garden, convened a meeting of the partners, reporting losses and difficulties in maintaining operations. It was resolved to entrust accountant Fei Zutai to liquidate the accounts. Recently, Li Runshen and others hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court against Zhang Qiuhua, the manager of the branch garden, and Chu Wenhan and other five partners, accusing them of embezzling common property. During the court hearing, Zhang Qiuhua and others appointed lawyer Li Wenjie to defend them, arguing that there were nine common partners in the garden, all using symbols as their names. They argued that Li Yansun and Li Bingsun did not have the status of partners and were not legally entitled to be plaintiffs. They further argued that the liquidation of the accounts was decided by the meeting, and the sale of property was within their duties, so it could not be considered embezzlement. Furthermore, the proceeds from the sale of goods were used to dismiss workers and pay off debts, which was a very proper purpose. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff's lawsuit was obviously for other purposes and hoped that others would be subject to criminal penalties. The defendants declared in court that they would file a counterclaim. After the court's trial, it was announced that the case was concluded and that a judgment would be delivered on the 29th.

Several Fake Police Loiter on Yidingpan Road, Run Away When Concession Police Arrive

The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (the 26th) at 6:07 PM, British soldiers from the Great Western Road barracks were given a "standby" order because it was reported that several plainclothes men with weapons, believed to be "Great Way" police, were loitering on Yidingpan Road. Two Chinese police officers ordered the armed men to leave the Concession road, but they ignored the order. The Jing'an Temple police station was called for a team of plainclothes and uniformed police officers wearing wire vests. When they arrived, the plainclothes men fled into Lane 469 Yidingpan Road, where a "Great Way" police station was located. It was later confirmed that only two of them were armed. Around 6:30 PM, the British troops returned to normal deployment and the "standby" order was cancelled.

### Woman Seduced and Sold into Brothel, Three-Year-Old Daughter Missing, Perpetrators Wang Shilin and Others Arrested

Yuan Zhangshi, a Ningbo woman formerly residing on Rue de Li Mei in the French Concession, whose husband, Yuan Ade, worked as a chef for a prominent family in the National Government, took her three-year-old daughter, Lindi, to the rooftop garden of the Sincere Company on March 1st of the previous year. A tourist from Suzhou named Wang Shilin saw her alone and beautiful, and approached her. Soon, they became intimate and went to the Yuanyuan Hotel on Sima Road.

They Spent Time Together in a Room

for over ten days, becoming very fond of each other. Wang Shilin, thinking he could deceive her, used false pretenses, saying that factories in Dalian were recruiting female workers with high salaries of 160 yuan every ten days. Yuan Zhangshi was lured by the promise of money and agreed to go to Dalian. Wang Shilin conspired with Li Guozhen and his son Li Maoxin, Chen Shunhe, and others living at No. 222 Zhejiang Road, first agreeing with Liu Wenkui, who ran a brothel in Dalian, on the

Terms of the Sale.

The price was 160 yuan. Wang Shilin sent an accomplice named Qiaozhen to accompany Yuan Zhangshi on the Qingdao Maru ship. Upon arriving in Dalian, they first stayed at Liu Wenkui's house at No. 10 Li Guangsi Road for a few nights. Liu then wanted to take Yuan Zhangshi to his brothel to prostitute her. Yuan Zhangshi, upon learning this, refused firmly and was imprisoned by Liu. She escaped during a moment of opportunity and went to the Ningbo Association in Dalian, reporting it to the police, who telegraphed Yuan Ade in Shanghai, notifying him to bring his wife back. However, the

Three-Year-Old Daughter Lindi

was nowhere to be found. Yuan Ade had reported his wife and daughter's disappearance to the police, requesting an investigation. Two years later, Yuan Zhangshi ran into Wang Shilin on Avenue Edward VII and approached him, asking him to return the girl, promising not to pursue the old matter. Wang Shilin invited her to Room 54 of the Avenue Edward VII Hotel, promising to find a way. After several days passed with no news, Yuan Zhangshi reported it to the New Gate Police Station. Chinese detectives Chen Shizhong and Li Yinmin were dispatched to arrest Wang Shilin and Chen Shunhe.

Two Individuals Were Arrested

and then went to the Zhongzheng Hotel at No. 11, Lane 604, Fuzhou Road to arrest the landlady, Gu Laoer (identified as Li Guozhen's concubine), taking them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case, requesting a postponement. After Judge Xiao interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained separately, and the case was rescheduled for July 7th for further interrogation.

### Indian Police Fight Robbers, Both Sides Fire Over Twenty Shots, Eight Robbers Escape

At around 11:10 AM yesterday morning, eight robbers suddenly arrived at the Xiechangtai Lumber Company, a three-bay shop at Nos. 1464-1468 Route des Soeurs in western Shanghai. Three of them were carrying pistols and one was carrying a Mauser pistol. They rushed into the accounting room, threatened with their guns, and looted at will, stealing 80 yuan in national currency. However, the shop had an alarm bell on the outside wall. While the robbery was in progress, a shop employee secretly pressed the alarm bell. As the robbers were escaping with the money, two Indian police officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, Nos. 82 and 594, rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the robbers pulled out their guns and resisted arrest, firing about twenty shots in rapid succession. The two Indian police officers also fired nine shots in return, but missed. All eight robbers managed to escape. No one was injured by stray bullets.

### Four Years of Marriage Without Consummation, Divorce Denied, Reason Being Fault Lies with the Woman

Xiang Meixiang, a 25-year-old woman from Ningbo, residing at No. 20 Ningbo Road in the Public Concession, married Shen Jiaju, a local man residing at No. 45 Taoyuan Village, Route Lavender, on April 27th, 1935, through a matchmaker. (Shen is 28 years old, graduated from Aurora University, and is a devout Catholic.) Unexpectedly, after the marriage, Xiang refused to consummate the marriage with her husband. From June 1st of the following year, Xiang used the excuse of returning to her maiden home, and never returned to her husband's home. Shen, although married for over four years, is still a nominal husband. Not only did Xiang not return to her husband's home, but she recently hired lawyer Wu Linkun to file for divorce in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting the court to order her husband to pay over 40,000 yuan in alimony and other expenses. Shen hired lawyer Tang Hao to defend him, opposing the divorce. After reviewing the documents, Judge Ma Yishu determined that the fault lay with Xiang, and yesterday announced the judgment in the Civil Court. The main text stated that the plaintiff's claim was dismissed, and the costs of the lawsuit were to be borne by the plaintiff.

### "Opium Suppression Bureau" Levies Excessive Taxes, Tobacco Prices Increase in All Opium Dens

After the establishment of the "Shanghai Local Opium Suppression Bureau" on the second floor of No. 912 North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, the bureau actively registered soil firms and opium dens in the four suburban areas. Due to increased taxes, a strike of opium dens in western Shanghai was triggered. It is now known that in order to maintain business, opium dens have automatically reopened, and soil firms are also registering with the fake "bureau" under high pressure. However, the price of soil and tobacco has soared along with the fake "donations," causing widespread complaints among addicts. The fake "bureau" is now planning to increase revenue, and from next month, "branch bureaus" will be set up in the counties of Pudong, Nanshi, and the nearby suburbs that have been incorporated into the fake "city." Some hooligans and gentry are actively maneuvering to obtain lucrative positions such as fake "branch bureau chief" or fake "inspector."

Liu Changsheng, a 27-year-old from Changzhou living at No. 7 Shudeli, Pingjili Road in the French Concession, was a partner in the lottery den run by Ren Quancai, a Pudong native, at No. 8 next door. On the 23rd at 9:00 AM, he had a dispute with Xu Gaofa, a Nanjing native currently running a lottery barge living at No. 103 Lao Shenfu Road, near the iron gate of Tangjia Bay, over lottery rights. They fought each other, causing Liu to suffer serious injuries and die after unsuccessful treatment (previously reported as being beaten to death due to arguing over Stone Immortal Portoring responsibilities). After receiving the report, the police arrested Xu. Liu was sent for an autopsy. The arrested perpetrator, Xu Gaofa, was sent to the Second Special Court the day before yesterday.

### Perpetrator Who Stabbed Pawnshop Accountant to Death Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Two Fugitives to Be Arrested and Reassessed

Ye Shizhong, a Suzhou native who was a compradore in a foreign firm and had been a captain of a South City Security Corps detachment, had an irreconcilable hatred with Tang Shenglin, a Suzhou native and accountant at the Fuchang Pawnshop at No. 12 Zilaihuo Street. He often planned revenge with his fellow villagers, Ye Chunian and Zhou Jie. On April 28th of this year, they held a meeting at the Great Shanghai Hotel to discuss methods to kill Tang. At that time, they purchased several knives, each pulled a hair and swore an oath to kill Tang, and then swore to join the army in Sichuan. That night, they went to Fuchang Pawnshop and stabbed Tang to death. After the incident, Ye Chunian failed to escape and was arrested by the French Concession police, who sent him to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, charging him with the crime of joint murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Ye's confession was evasive, but witness Jiang Haoqing firmly identified Ye as one of the three criminals. After Judge Liao Qingbang concluded the trial, he took his seat in the First Criminal Court yesterday morning and ordered the defendant to be brought before him to announce the verdict. The main text stated that Ye Chunian was sentenced to life imprisonment for joint murder, with deprivation of public rights for life. Ye Shizhong and Zhou Jie, who are on the run, will be reassessed after they are arrested.

### Shipowner Sues for Return of Ship After Vessel Joins Japanese Company; Wins Lawsuit; Defendant Ordered to Return Ship and Pay Damages

A man named Han Funan, residing at No. 44, Tongkang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, leased his Yongfu steamship to Liu Wuqi, residing at No. 1, Xinqingfang, Baier Road, for inland river navigation on May 17th of last year. The monthly rent was 1,600 national currency, with a term of one month. Qu Mingqing, owner of the Quchangshun Fish Shop in Xiaodongmen, and Yan Shanzhou, residing at No. 6, Shangxianfang, Malang Road, served as guarantors. On July 17th of last year, Liu, as agreed, moored the ship near the Old Garbage Bridge on the Suzhou River, where it was recovered by Cai Juming, the ship captain hired by Han. On the 19th of that month, the ship was suddenly towed away by the "Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company" controlled by the Japanese. Subsequently, Han hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a complaint with the Second Special Court's Civil Division, requesting that Liu Wuqi, Zhai Mingqing, and Yan Shanzhou be ordered to jointly return the ship and compensate for losses of 11,200 yuan. The initial trial, presided over by Judge Li Liang, ruled against the plaintiff's claim. Han, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The trial concluded a few days ago, and the judgment was announced in the Third Court by Chief Justice Xia on the afternoon of yesterday at 3 p.m. The main text of the judgment stated: The original judgment is reversed; the defendant Liu Wuqi shall return the Yongfu steamship to Han Funan. If the ship cannot be returned, he shall compensate for the ship's value of 8,000 yuan and shall compensate Han Funan for losses of 9,200 yuan. If the litigation costs cannot be paid, Zhai Mingqing and Yan Shanzhou shall be jointly liable for repayment. Liu Wuqi and others, dissatisfied with the judgment, decided to appeal to the Supreme Court.

### The Preconditions for Couples Seeking Eternal Love

The reason why humans are considered the most intelligent of all things is that they have knowledge, emotions, and will. They do not haggle over the present but must strive for the final victory; therefore, only gambling everything on one occasion is not a high-level human behavior. When men and women of marriageable age choose a spouse, who does not carefully consider it again and again in order to seek eternal love and grow old together? As for couples whose love wanes midway, who are outwardly harmonious but inwardly estranged, who share a bed but dream different dreams, or who even litigate for divorce, it must be because either party has discovered a crisis that they cannot love each other forever, and therefore, the foundation of their marriage has shaken.

Let us be frank: marriage is the union of sexual relations. The reason why their foundation shakes is because their sexual life cannot be happy. In principle, the love of a couple is mutually beneficial and mutually enjoyable. Why can't it be happy? It must be caused by a pathological condition in one party's sexual function. According to medical judgments, if a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been promiscuous and indulgent after marriage, or if early marriage with multiple wives has consumed too much of his reproductive gland fluid, then symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, spermatorrhea, infertility, and neurasthenia will arise. Such husbands often feel the pain of lack of strength in their marital life. At the same time, how can a wife's enthusiasm withstand this cold destruction? Many wives' symptoms of anorgasmia, uterine congestion, hysteria, and neurasthenia arise from this. As for those with strong temperaments, they find other ways out, commit adultery, elope, and file for divorce from their husbands, which is commonplace in today's society.

Couples who wish to live a happy life in the paradise of eternal love must first have healthy sexual function. Therefore, smart couples must carefully maintain and cherish it. If the above symptoms occur, they must seek the most appropriate and effective treatment. According to thousands of case studies from world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, taking reproductive gland element preparations [Reproductin] (divided into male and female) is the best. Because this agent is of high quality and has accurate efficacy, the drug's effect starts one hour after taking it. In 24 hours, it will produce essence and tonify the kidneys in men, and regulate menstruation and stop leucorrhea in women. Continuing to take it for a week will promote developmental function, invigorate metabolism, strengthen the brain, and activate blood, and can completely cure the above-mentioned combined symptoms. Long-term use has the effect of prolonging life and reversing aging, so Chinese and Western doctors recommend this agent. However, male friends with spermatorrhea must also take [Hemetos' Spermatin Tablets] (available at Wuzhou, Chinese-Western-French and other large pharmacies) to stop leakage until it is stopped. It can treat both the symptoms and the root cause, and its effectiveness is faster.

### Breasts are the Atoms that Nurture Love's Seedlings

‚Äî Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

This is not an exaggeration, nor is it an insult to women, nor is it self-flattery. We men are too tempted by women's breasts. No matter how honest and upright you are, when you take a walk in the park in the evening and see many healthy women with bare arms and legs, giggling and laughing, walking in front of you, their clothes are so thin, the curves are so obvious, and especially the towering breasts rise and fall slightly, as if nodding to you, even if you are a Liu Xiahui, in this situation and looking at this scene, I am afraid you will also be deeply moved? Therefore, Dr. Baterson, a one-dollar doctor in the United States, said in a recent book called "The Secret of Love" that a woman's breasts are the god of happiness between husband and wife, and the atoms that nurture love's seedlings. He believes that if a woman's breasts are higher and more elastic, then her reproductive gland ovary function must be strong, so her temperament will be more gentle, enthusiastic, and able to give men soaring pleasure, the so-called "just right", so the family is full of joy, and happiness is boundless! Conversely, if a woman's breasts are sagging, or even withered like a man's, it can be determined that she suffers from various unspeakable hidden diseases, and also suffers from anorgasmia and infertility. Such women have lost the beautiful curves in their posture, and make men feel tasteless in their marital life. Because of their various adverse effects, many tragedies are staged!

Then how can women with withered breasts seek remedy? According to the world-famous gynecologist Dr. Condelin and my experience, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductin" is the most appropriate and effective. The ingredients of this agent are extracted from the ovarian essence of extremely healthy animals and prepared by scientific methods. Therefore, the medicinal properties are mild and the efficacy is great. If you continue to take it, it will not only make the withered breasts rise day by day, and the thin buttocks gradually become plump, but also adjust menstruation, rosy cheeks, and keep youth forever.

### The Relationship between Spermatorrhea and Brain Weakness and Insomnia

‚Äî Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Excessive spermatorrhea can lead to brain weakness and insomnia, which young people with a little common sense should know! At the same time, if a young person suffers from insomnia due to excessive use of the brain, or due to hot weather, unrequited love, sadness, etc., they are also most likely to suffer from spermatorrhea. Accordingly, in this hot and humid season, sweating is endless, the air is humid, and the air pressure is quite low, so there is often a phenomenon of nocturnal emission. If those who have always had spermatorrhea do not pay attention to prevention and treatment, then the symptoms will inevitably worsen. Therefore, there are those who are led to spermatorrhea, sperm leakage, and brain, spinal cord, and sexual triple nerve weakness caused by spermatorrhea. As a result, various symptoms such as headache, amnesia, insomnia, sadness, backache, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, and dissipation of energy will follow. Such young people will not only be depressed and afraid of cold and heat, but will also see their lives in distress and achieve nothing! At the same time, due to the pain of love, even if they get married through matchmakers and parents' orders, they will not be happy in their marital life, be hated by their wives, or even have no children, leaving lifelong regrets! Therefore, young people should not take spermatorrhea lightly. In this yellow plum season, they should pay special attention to prevention. According to the world's famous doctors and my experience, the effective treatment for spermatorrhea is to take "Hemetos' Spermatin Tablets" to strengthen the spermatic gate, calm the nerves, and make you sleep peacefully at night and reduce dreams, so that spermatorrhea can be stopped that night. If the above symptoms have already occurred due to spermatorrhea, you must also take the reproductive gland element preparation "Reproductin" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you can continue to take it, you will definitely be able to cure the above symptoms in a short period of time and can also guarantee a cure.

### Editor's Remarks

Although foreign exchange has plummeted and prices have soared in recent days, customers sincerely want old brands and things that are believed by tens of thousands of people, and they are never willing to take advantage of opportunities. For example, the giants in the domestic cigarette industry‚ÄîHuacheng and Nanyang‚Äîthe cigarettes they produce, first, will not easily increase prices unless it is absolutely necessary, so as not to burden old customers; second, they will not give away gifts as a cover for cutting corners, so they can enjoy a long-standing reputation and remain prosperous. This is a good example. It is heard that the various famous medicines such as "Reproductin" and "Hemetos' Spermatin Tablets" managed by Anliss Pharmaceutical in this city, because they were purchased very early, so they also stick to these two New Year's resolutions. Moderate and not rising prices, not giving away gifts, because fairness lies in the hearts of the people, and you can see the difference after taking them, so they do not make false propaganda.

### Do Not Use Patients as Sacrificial Items to Treat Gonorrhea!

Among venereal diseases, none is more contagious than gonorrhea. At the same time, in terms of treatment, none is more difficult to treat than gonorrhea. However, the world knows that it is so, but does not know why. Since gonorrhea is a difficult disease to treat, its treatment should be treated with utmost caution. Unfortunately, patients often privately take over-the-counter drugs that are rampant on the market, or blindly believe in a rigid surgical operation with local medical instruments. Gonorrhea is not limited to the local area, and the symptoms are not fixed, so how can one adhere to a single over-the-counter drug, which is no different from carving a boat to seek a sword, because there is only one kind of medicine and the disease is ever-changing. As for local surgical instrument therapy, at best, it only acts on the local area. In fact, wanting to squeeze out gonococci by washing with medical instruments is like a fool's dream, and only fools believe it. Because after gonorrhea invades the posterior urethra, its physiological structure is very complex, and gonococci can survive everywhere. It is impossible to completely drive out the gonococci with simple medical instruments.

With my experience of more than ten years, I treat gonorrhea without sticking to set methods. I use needles, medicines, electrotherapy, news ions, massage, etc. I first rely on scientific diagnostic methods to understand the condition, and then treat the symptoms. The treatments I use are the most advanced, such as the German Lulin Pingliu electric method in electrotherapy, the German Xishi serum in blood serum, and the latest chemical therapy for internal medicine. The responsibility of us doctors is to seek a quick cure, neither sticking to set methods nor competing for novelty, and not using patients as sacrificial items.

### Middle School Students Without Original School Certificates Can Still Graduate If Several Subjects Are Passed; Those Who Pass All Subjects After Borrowing May Have Previous Subjects Considered as Passing

(Fangyan Correspondence) The Zhejiang Education Department previously stated that since the War of Resistance Against Japan, there have been many students in the province whose student status could not be determined because the original schools were in the war zone and could not obtain certificates. Regarding the graduation of these students, the department previously instructed the schools that transferred or borrowing students who had reached graduation, if their graduation exam scores were passing, and because the situation of the original school was unknown, and they could not submit the transcript of the previous semesters, the middle school would first issue a graduation certificate. Now, in order to conclude the graduation problem of these students and make a unified decision, it will be handled in accordance with the method of the Guangdong Provincial Education Department's Order No. 944 of the Ministry of Education in 1938. For middle school students who borrow or transfer, if the grades of each subject in the previous semesters cannot be submitted at the time of graduation, and the scores after borrowing are passing, the grades of each subject in the previous years can be regarded as passing. The schools that have issued graduation certificates to the previous graduates can prepare graduation certificates, together with a list of graduates' scores, and send them to the department for review and re-issuance. The province's public and private middle schools have been informed accordingly.

### A Summary of Chinese Broadcasting Education in the Last Three Years (3): Dispatching Personnel for Inspection and Evaluation of Results; Allocating Funds Starting from the Fifth Year

Evaluation of Results

The Ministry of Education successively promulgated various measures for implementing broadcasting education in provinces and cities, as well as guidelines for secondary schools and public education centers using broadcasting education. It also issued key points for provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus to pay attention to regarding electro-visual education administration, and key points for implementing electro-visual education in provinces and cities in the 26th year. These documents contained detailed regulations on the tasks and performance evaluation of personnel at all levels. The Ministry of Education and provincial and municipal inspectors and supervisors, when inspecting schools and centers equipped with radios, also included the radio reception performance as an important evaluation item for these schools and centers.

Allocation of Funds

When the Ministry of Education initiated and managed broadcasting education in the 24th year, there were no dedicated funds. Expenses were only paid by economizing on the ministry's operating expenses. Starting from the 25th year, after the central government determined the funds for public construction, 300,000 yuan was allocated specifically for broadcasting education. In the 26th year, 135,000 yuan was allocated, including subsidies to provinces and cities for radios and dry batteries, accounting for 125,000 yuan. From July to December of the 27th year, 40,000 yuan was allocated, including subsidies to provinces and cities for radios and dry batteries, accounting for 35,000 yuan, and broadcasting education administration accounting for 5,000 yuan. Provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus also allocated special funds for broadcasting education according to the Ministry of Education's orders. Radio receiving agencies were also required to allocate funds for broadcasting education within their respective operating expenses. However, due to the difficulty of raising funds in various provinces, cities, and counties, the required amount of funds for the operation has not yet been achieved.

Remedying Difficulties

(1) There are too few domestic manufacturers of radios and dry batteries. The output is insufficient to meet the demand, and the production sites are mostly concentrated in Shanghai, making procurement and transportation difficult. Remote provinces often suffer from damage to components and battery failure after long periods of transportation. The Ministry of Education has requested the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Radio Manufacturing Plant, to increase the production of radios, and to add dry battery manufacturing plants in Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to facilitate procurement in the northwest and southwest border provinces. (2) The Ministry of Education has trained few electro-visual education personnel in the past, and they cannot be widely dispatched to serve in various counties. In addition, the procurement of parts and components is inconvenient in various provinces, cities, and counties, resulting in frequent radio damage and inability to repair. Starting from the 27th year, the Ministry of Education and provincial education departments have added technical personnel to provide radio technology guidance to various provinces and cities. (3) There is no dedicated educational broadcasting station, so the educational programs that are set up are affected by other programs, and the programs cannot be expanded as much as possible. The Ministry of Education originally had a plan to set up its own shortwave broadcasting station, but it was unsuccessful due to the war. It is reported that the ministry will continue to plan and set it up after the situation is calm, for the purpose of broadcasting educational programs exclusively. (4) The Ministry of Education, in view of the uneconomical and inconvenient purchase and distribution of radios in the past, ordered the Broadcasting Education Committee to set up a small factory to manufacture radios. Unfortunately, it was affected by the war shortly after its establishment and stopped. Now, the ministry has cooperated with the Electrical Engineering Factory of Jinda College of Science to assemble radios, which can temporarily remedy the situation. It is reported that after the situation is stable, it can be restored to work and manufacture its own factories. (5) Regarding the examination of radio reception results, although the Ministry of Education has formulated rules and instructed supervisors and inspectors to inspect them at any time, most of these inspection personnel are just taking a cursory look. It is still questionable whether all radio receiving agencies can listen to educational broadcasts on time. It is reported that the Ministry of Education plans to increase the number of broadcasting tests once a month, that is, to compile a simple test based on the broadcasting materials of this month, and broadcast the test questions. Those who participate will be given small prizes to encourage them. The implementation of this method also increases the interest of radio reception personnel. (End)

### How to Guide Children's Holiday Life

‚Äî Lu Guanliu

As the saying goes, "Learn until you are old, and you will never learn enough." It can be seen that our pursuit of knowledge is not limited to a specific place, nor is it limited to a specific time. We cannot say that schools are places for acquiring knowledge, while homes and society are not. We cannot say that term time is a time for learning, while rest days and holidays are not. Therefore, we must guide children to learn new things and acquire new knowledge anytime and anywhere. However, based on this principle, we can know that even if it is summer vacation, it does not mean that it is a time for children to purely rest and not acquire knowledge. It only means that due to the weather conditions, the methods of acquiring knowledge and the activities of children need to be changed to another method.

How exactly do children's methods of acquiring knowledge and activities change during the holidays? It can be divided into three aspects: First, in terms of knowledge activities, this means changing the form of class and adopting self-study methods. Assign self-study holiday assignments to children to do, so that children can gain new knowledge from reviewing their homework. Second, in terms of civic activities, this means changing children's narrow school life into a broad social life. Within the scope of children's abilities, take advantage of the spare time during the holidays to participate in appropriate social work. Third, in terms of health activities, this means reducing the burden of children's homework during the holidays, paying attention to physical exercise, paying attention to hygiene, reducing the intrusion of diseases, paying attention to sports, and increasing the health of the body.

Ordinary schools think that when the holidays arrive, they only need to assign some holiday assignments to children to do, and they think that they have done their best. In fact, this is still not enough, because children's lifestyles are different from usual during the summer vacation. Teachers must guide them on how to spend this long holiday life. Moreover, since the summer vacation is not a time for studying with peace of mind, they leave the school and return to their families, with more opportunities to contact society. Therefore, they should be guided to do some social activities to enable children to understand and learn about society from this work. Secondly, in terms of health, the summer is originally the most unhygienic time, because the hot weather and the breeding of mosquitoes and flies often make it easy for people to get sick. Therefore, the more it is in summer, the more attention should be paid to hygiene, so as to maintain health. Therefore, during the summer vacation, health activities and social activities are more valuable, more meaningful, and more worthy of our advocacy and guidance than knowledge activities.

Regarding social activities, there are several tasks that can be guided to do:

(1) Organize reading clubs, contact nearby classmates, discuss with each other, and seek progress together.

(2) Promote "little teachers" and do some popular education work, teaching illiterate people in their own families or relatives and neighbors.

(3) Discuss current affairs issues and use collective methods to systematically and plan to study current affairs knowledge.

(4) Publish neighborhood wall newspapers or do live radio broadcasts to increase the knowledge of the general public and arouse the research of the general public.

(5) Implement mosquito and fly eradication work, pay attention to nearby public health, and do some epidemic prevention work.

(6) Promote frugality and disaster relief to awaken the general public's understanding of frugality. Actively implement frugality work.

Regarding health activities, there are also several tasks that can be guided to children to do:

(1) Do morning exercises for ten minutes every morning, (2) Play a few games every week, (3) Take a walk outside a few times every week, (4) Take a bath every day, (5) Underwear work, (6) Have a fixed amount of food every day, (7) Have a fixed time to sleep every day.

If the above tasks can be guided to children to do, then children's holiday life can have satisfactory results.

### Heberden Disappoints, Xu Chengji Withdraws, Many Famous Players Do Not Participate, Cai Huiquan Enters the Second Week

(London, 26th, Havas) The Heberden Tennis Championships began today. Queen Mary also attended the match. In the men's singles, German tennis star Krahmer and Australian star Brownvich did not participate. In addition, Chinese tennis player Xu Chengji, although he had participated, temporarily announced his withdrawal. All of this has reduced the interest in the competition.

(Heberden, 26th, Reuters) Chinese tennis star Xu Chengji has withdrawn from the Heberden Men's Singles Championship. Xu told Reuters that his back muscles had not healed since winning the Birmingham Championship. It has not yet been decided whether to participate in doubles. Xu's withdrawal allowed the British Twenties to enter the second week without a fight. (Note: Xu's hopes this year were better than in the past. Although he was listed as a seed player in the previous tournament, he was not selected this year, but it is not extravagant to expect to reach at least the quarter-final week. Xu's failure to be selected as a seed player this year may be due to his unexpected defeat to France in the Taiwan tournament. His disadvantage lies in his lack of physical strength, his inability to fight five sets, which led to the defeat of the British star Bowness, and his success in other European competitions has made tennis experts deeply believe that he will have an amazing masterpiece in this year's Heberden tournament.)

He Renxuan

Another Chinese player, He Renxuan, was defeated by Czech Trona on the opening day today, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. Xu Chengji was a guest of honor. Trona, who shoots with his left hand, hit straight into the corner of the net with his quick shots, making He Renxuan helpless. He's first ball was unreliable. His heyday was in the third set, where he fought to a 4-4 tie.

Cai Huiquan

Chinese Davis Cup player Cai Huiquan defeated Irish player Egan in five sets, 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. Cai's performance was completely lackluster. Initially, his hits were chaotic. In the third set, he only managed to win with a powerful stroke. Egan won two sets in a row, but finally collapsed. The two fought fiercely for two hours.

Other

The weather was fine today, but then the clouds gathered. Only one or two accidents occurred in the closing match of the men's singles, namely, the elimination of German Davis Cup player Mitaksas and French Pusays. Queen Manly was also present to watch the game, at which time Menzel was eliminating British Peters in the central arena. The results of the important groups of men's play are as follows:

Xu Chengji gave up to British Gan.

Cai Huiquan (China) beat Egan (Ireland) 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.

Science and Life

### The Recognition of the Whole

‚Äî Ji Qian

There are many reasons why science has not been fully developed in our country. However, one of the biggest reasons is that our people do not have a clear understanding of science itself. Whenever we do something, we always think of finding a shortcut, looking for a secret, thinking that we can reap success and achieve a lifetime of peace. The same psychology is also inevitable in our study of academics. Seventy or eighty years ago, our people already knew the importance of science, and the government was quite keen to promote it. At that time, there was no shortage of people in the country who were determined to research science. However, what they recognized for this kind of work was only one end of science, not the whole. For example, mathematics is a broad and profound academic field, and its importance in the position of science, and the need to pay attention to promotion in the country, is undoubtedly. However, only knowing to focus on this subject and neglecting various sciences, thinking that this subject is the mother of all sciences, and that if we can deeply understand mathematics, then all scientific problems can be solved easily, is also inevitable to have an excessive bias. In the past, the Shanghai Gezhi College originally aimed at cultivating scientific talents, and most of those who studied there were also talented people of the time, and they all tended to one way of mathematics. They did not have time to attack physics, chemistry, and other fields, and they regarded biology and geology as trivial matters. It is heard that the instruments purchased by the college for the study of physics, chemistry, and other subjects were as numerous as the eaves, but they were not used and were left to rot. The students focused on mathematics, thinking that once they had a deep understanding of this subject, all instruments could be used as tools to solve all scientific problems. In the end, only one or two of them seemed to have made some achievements in mathematics, while they were still completely unaware of the other scientific fields. Sciences other than mathematics were not noticed and had no hope of budding and growing. What is said above is just one example. In the past few decades, there have been countless such errors in our country's promotion of science and research of science. Science itself is a healthy organic matter, in which each field is indispensable, so that it can receive the effect of helping each other. All fields of science must be equally valued. With the overall development of science, agitation and tempering, assistance and observation, practical science will continue to progress, benefiting people's livelihoods, and solving countless difficulties for the country and society. I hope that those who promote science education in the country will pay attention to this.

### Food and Nutrition

‚Äî Xin Zhi

Ancient philosophers have considered the need for food and nutrition. However, the progress of nutritional knowledge, like other sciences, started with experiments, gaining an inch at a time, a foot at a time, and gradually expanding until the threads could be straightened out. In fact, the era of experiments began a hundred years ago. In this short period of a hundred years, it is a great achievement in science to be able to go from complete darkness to gradually seeing the light.

More than 2,300 years ago, the Greek Hippocrates, the ancestor of Western medicine, believed that all foods contain a universal nourishing substance. That is to say, although there are ten thousand kinds of food, there is only one kind of nourishing substance. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Martin began to feed various foods to animals for experiments. However, it was limited to non-nitrogenous foods such as sugar gum. The precision of its experimental methods is quite strict for later generations. Its ability to distinguish the effects of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous foods has laid the foundation for modern physiology and biochemistry. Years later, Mulbaomin distinguished the similarities of various protein substances in the body of animals and plants, and named them "proloti", which is still considered to be the main organic substance in the body. Combined with Li Biexu's achievements, the knowledge of food chemistry has been increased a lot. Lai Fuxie and Vander's research on the energy required by the human body are also worthy of record. At the end of the nineteenth century, the US Department of Agriculture's announcement contained nutritional value conditions: listing the chemical composition of food, the proportion of nutritional components, the ease of digestion, the comparison of fuel values, the relationship between nutrition and price, the most suitable food and nutritional value ratio required by endurance in various industries, and so on.

Experts studying nutritional issues have devoted themselves to explaining the experience of humans with various foods for many years. However, society still despises the nutritional theory created by scientists, mostly because everyone has their own experience of food. Most people think that the method of choosing suitable food is purely based on appetite and economic ability as the criteria, which is enough to deal with it. However, after animal feeding experiments, it is certain that there are several diseases of nutritional imbalance that can be obtained from food experiments. This kind of imbalance is no different from ordinary diseases, so it is not easy to understand the main cause. Since the application of the knowledge of food properties to the research of diseases, it is known that wrong food is the root cause of physical weakness and early death. Paying attention to the conditioning of food can make the sick healthy and the healthy long-lived. This is true.

The history of the progress of nutrition research is the result of decades or hundreds of people's deep thinking and detailed verification over the past hundred years. The purpose is nothing more than to seek knowledge of the necessity of human nutrition and the nature of food. One of the most important sections is the invention of trace vitamins. Trace vitamins are sometimes transliterated as vitamins, sometimes transliterated as vitamins or vital factors. The revised translation is trace vitamins, although it is a transliteration, it also shows that the amount in food is very small, but the use is very effective. If it is adjusted to be the safety factor for maintaining life, then it is not worth this type of substance, and all foods are essential elements for maintaining life. Moreover, strictly speaking, trace vitamins are not chemically of the same type of substance. At first, knowledge was naive and their properties were not understood, so they were collectively called trace vitamins, just like XY in algebra as the representative of unknown numbers and A and B in novels represent unnamed people.

### How Drinking Harms Health

‚Äî Lu Yi

Alcohol poisoning can be divided into two types: acute and chronic. So-called drunkenness is acute poisoning. It is said to be due to the stimulating nature of alcohol, but in reality, alcohol is not a stimulant. It inhibits the part of the brain that normally restricts personal behavior, leading to a loss of self-control.

Once the brain loses its self-control, thoughts are freed from their usual rationality and caution, allowing them to roam freely. Therefore, a drunkard often becomes rude, talkative, loudly and strangely laughing, and exhibits various abnormal behaviors. A heavily intoxicated person may even become dazed or even fall into a coma. In this state of overindulgence, one staggers while walking, speaks incoherently, the face flushes, the pulse quickens, the eyes become bloodshot, and increased blood flow to the brain causes dizziness. Vomiting is also a common symptom.

Alcohol has a local irritant effect, especially on the stomach. It can cause redness and swelling of the stomach lining, forming minor ulcers. People who drink alcohol for a long time will inevitably develop serious pathological changes in their stomachs. Swallowing liquors with extremely high alcohol content, such as Gaoliang spirit, will inevitably cause a burning sensation in the abdomen, indicating the local effect of alcohol in the stomach.

The stomach does not usually absorb food, but alcohol is an exception, being absorbed very easily, so poisoning occurs rapidly. Those who wish to avoid intoxication for a long time should never drink on an empty stomach, as alcohol is absorbed faster on an empty stomach than when full.

The best food to eat while drinking or beforehand is fatty food. Alcohol is an excellent solvent for fat, so the two have a special affinity. Carbohydrates (sugar, candied fruit, sweets) are the worst foods to accompany alcohol. Chemically speaking, carbohydrates are a disguised form of alcohol. Therefore, all sweet wines should be avoided.

Because drunkenness is a very common occurrence, people rarely think about the more serious condition of chronic alcohol poisoning. If alcohol is consumed continuously, leading to long-term alcohol poisoning, significant changes occur in the body. Some are so severe that they disrupt normal physiological functions and lead to death. The first inevitable change occurs in the digestive tract. Alcohol acts as a local irritant, causing indigestion, loss of appetite, and chronic catarrhal cough, known as "alcoholic cough."

A red nose is a marker of chronic alcohol poisoning, indicating the impairment of blood vessels. Alcohol acts on the walls of blood vessels, causing them to degenerate. As the walls weaken, the blood vessels dilate; the small blood vessels on the nose and cheeks allow more blood to enter, thus causing these areas to turn red. Any poisoning of the viscera and blood vessels must cause corresponding damage to the internal organs connected to the portal system.

Therefore, those who suffer from long-term chronic alcohol poisoning will inevitably have all their important organs affected, with the kidneys being the first to be harmed.

With changes in blood supply, alcohol exerts its latent harmful effects on the muscles. The voluntary muscles (muscles we can control) of the affected person are partially damaged by fatty degeneration, thus certain muscle groups show signs of paralysis, and the entire musculature displays inconsistent and miserable signs.

If the amount consumed is very small and can be completely oxidized by the body, alcohol is very much like a food. Because it can generate energy, some even mistakenly call it food. But when consumed in excess, alcohol is absolutely toxic. Therefore, if civilized people must indulge in drinking for pleasure, the only way is to use the power of education to guide them to drink in moderation. The saying, "Do not drink excessively, lest you become disorderly," is our ancient teaching.

### Great Revolutions of the Earth

‚Äî Shi

The phenomenon of revolution (Revolution) is seen in many human affairs, such as political revolution, social revolution, economic revolution, and even family revolution, psychological revolution, etc. Any major reform in human society can be called a revolution. However, these are all small-scale revolutions, not to be compared with the great revolution. The so-called greatest revolution can only be applied to the Earth. The Earth has undergone about four periods of dramatic changes, which are called the Four Great Revolutions. The other changes it has experienced are not comparable to these. These four great revolutions were all caused by the expansion or contraction of the Earth's internal magma, which inevitably caused the Earth's crust to bulge or sink. These drastic changes caused mountains to rise suddenly, deep ravines to sink, glaciers to flow horizontally, and the climate to change abruptly. All mountain ranges, rivers, and all living organisms on the Earth's surface were greatly affected. For example, trilobites, ancient insects, ancient members, turtles, ancient amphibians, and giant reptiles (such as various dinosaurs, dragons, ichthyosaurs, etc.), primitive birds, and giant mammals in fossils mostly lost their lives and became extinct during a great revolutionary period. All living organisms in the world today are fortunate to have escaped extinction, or have evolved as a result of the threat of great revolutions, to the degree they are today. The first of these four great revolutions was discovered in the early Cambrian period of the Paleozoic Era, about 100 million years ago. The third occurred at the junction of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras, this change being slightly less than the first two, about 60 million years ago. The fourth occurred in the later period of the Cenozoic Era (Pleistocene), about one million years ago, far less than these four, so it cannot be called a revolution. But the future is long. Will there be another great revolution in the future? Will a large part of all living organisms in the world (including humans) be imprisoned and become extinct, and will new ones emerge to replace them? This is also unknowable. Or perhaps, with the increasing development of science, humans will be able to use it to avoid the disaster of extinction.

### Peach Blossom Musings

‚Äî Qiaoxia Ke

"In the third month of late spring, the grasses of Jiangnan grow tall, miscellaneous flowers bloom on the trees, and warblers fly in a chaotic manner. Seeing the flags and drums of the old country, I feel the past in my heart," these few sentences, for some reason, now cause some people to feel deeply moved. Thus, peach blossom musings are evoked.

Some Western scholars have reduced all of life's phenomena to the relationship between the sexes; this may be a bit of an oversimplification. Of course, we cannot deny that sexual activity‚Äîreproduction‚Äîin the biological world is the most important part of life, and we humans are no exception. However, where there is writing, a word "love" is created out of nowhere, and sometimes this ordinary word is clothed in a mysterious cloak. What is going on? If we say that patriotism and love of one's hometown express a need for a suitable environment; love of calligraphy and painting, and love of antiques express a need for an object of study; love of relatives, acquaintances, and friends expresses a kind of sympathy, then we can say that love is need. Or, if someone needs love, how should this be explained? What's so difficult about that? He just needs a need; a person with no needs is inconceivable. Or, people all need to eat, but people don't seem to love rice, wouldn't that be inconsistent? Oh, how is that relevant? If you haven't eaten for three days, I think you can't help but squeeze your stomach and shout, "Rice, I am willing to sacrifice everything for you." Therefore, "a short pass at the Three Gorges at dusk, only seeing your affection later," is moved only after a close friend dies, and "customs across the world are mutually loving" is appreciated only after leaving one's hometown; all are the same. These examples of love are not mysterious. Now comes the love between men and women, we can say that it is a need between men and women, but it must be divided into two kinds: one is organizational on a social level, such as managing household affairs, division of labor between inside and outside, and the other is based on the common rules of biology, which is to complete sexual intercourse. The first kind of need is no different in principle from loving relatives, acquaintances, and friends; the second kind of need is unique to men and women, so the problem arises here. Sexual desire is best exemplified by appetite; when hungry, one must eat, and one does not refuse to achieve it by any means. When full, the matter is finished. Who would still hold a bowl of rice and admire it after being full? That is the world's greatest lover. Of course, the length of time the whole process takes is different. (To be continued)

### Finance: Gold Bar Collateral Loans Vanish; Spot Feels Oversupplied; Continues to Fall for Five Days: Mostly Small Transactions, Few Bulk Deals: Approximately 600 Taels

Yesterday's spot market for cash gold continued to trend downward, having fallen for five consecutive days. This phenomenon is actually due to the virtual disappearance of gold bar collateral loans after the Ministry of Finance restricted the withdrawal of legal tender, resulting in the lack of strong buyers who are unable to operate easily. Furthermore, the exchange rate has also been easing for days, and people's sentiment is ultimately weary and unable to rally. Today's market was further triggered by the easing exchange rate, causing securities firms to repeatedly sell relentlessly. In addition, a certain bank also saw more outflows than inflows. Although Hong Kong buyers had some appetite, the head position still felt oversupplied. The market trend remained weak, once retreating to a low of 2,495 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops and retail investors took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and the underlying trend stabilized, hovering around 2,500 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 2,500 yuan, continuing to fall by 30 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were mostly small, with few bulk deals, totaling approximately 600 taels. Gold jewelry also fell slightly by four yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Cash Trade at 2,500 Yuan

From the morning, the initial opening price per tael (ten taels) fell slightly by ten yuan because it was heard that the exchange rate was hardening again, making people more tired. The market opened at 9:40 AM, with cash houses selling two taels to money changers at a price of 2,510 yuan. Subsequently, cash houses sold another ten taels to gold shops at the same price. At that time, securities firms suddenly started selling, and the market trend became even weaker, falling seven yuan in an instant. Securities firms sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at 13 yuan. Soon after, securities firms sold another 50 taels to a certain gold shop at 10 yuan (rumored to be on behalf of Hong Kong buyers). Later, securities firms sold another 30 taels to gold houses at 12 yuan. After that, the exchange rate continued to harden, and buyers were scarce, so the price plummeted another ten yuan. Money changers sold two taels to a certain bank at a price of two yuan. At that time, securities firms continued to sell aggressively, and buyers were watching from the sidelines, so the price became even more unsustainable, breaking through the 2,500 yuan mark. Securities firms sold ten taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 495 yuan. Then, a group of retail investors suddenly took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and the selling momentum of securities firms slowed down slightly, immediately showing a rebound. Money changers sold two taels to gold shops at a price of 500 yuan. Immediately, money changers sold another ten taels to a certain bank at a price of four yuan, and two taels to colleagues at a price of three yuan. At that time, gold shops were more eager to buy, and the trend continued to rise gradually. A certain gold shop bought 30 taels from a certain bank at a price of six yuan. Gold houses bought two taels from cash houses at a price of seven yuan. Gold shops bought ten taels from securities firms and 50 taels from a certain bank, both at a price of eight yuan. As noon approached, the market trend weakened again. Cash houses sold 50 taels to gold houses, pressing the price down to 500 yuan as the closing price for the morning. The afternoon trend was flat and tired. At about 2:00 PM, money changers traded ten taels with each other at a price of two yuan. Then, money changers sold 50 taels to Yuhao at a price of 500 yuan. At that time, securities firms slightly increased their supply, selling 50 taels to money changers at a price of 498 yuan. Soon after, money changers traded ten taels with each other at a price of 497 yuan. Afterwards, sellers' willingness to supply weakened, and the price immediately rebounded. At 2:45 PM, gold houses bought 50 taels from money changers, with 2,500 yuan as the closing price for the evening. As a result, it continued to fall by 30 yuan compared to yesterday, and it has fallen for five consecutive days, totaling 200 yuan. The fluctuations throughout the day were 25 yuan. The wooden sign gold price of cash houses was ten yuan higher, and the current market price was 50 yuan lower. According to inquiries, there were very few trades.

Jewelry Gold Price Lowered Twice by Four Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael remained unchanged at first, but by 9:55 AM, it was lowered by two yuan, and then lowered by another two yuan at about 10:00 AM, due to the weakness of spot gold. After that, the spot gold situation stabilized, so there were no more changes. The Big Guild posted 250 yuan, the New Guild posted 251 yuan, and Mumu posted 245 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Remained Unchanged

According to a London dispatch on the 26th, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at seven pounds, eight shillings, and sixpence per ounce. Therefore, the market prices of various central banks also remained unchanged. The cash buying price in China was 1,212.3 yuan, the listed customs gold price was 2.396 yuan, and the Shanghai standard gold price was also 1,207.6 yuan.

### Japanese Merchants' Sales Become More Eager, Exchange Rate Continues to Ease

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw no changes in the HSBC listing price. The sentiment in the unofficial market was that Japanese banks' willingness to sell was increasing day by day (one theory is that the forward trading is arbitrage), and foreign dispatches from Indian silver companies were also selling. Chinese banks and foreign banks occasionally followed suit due to the need for legal tender at the end of the month. In addition, foreign banks' appetite for buying was not strong, so the situation was quite easy and hard to bear. Although foreign firms made some settlements in the middle, the overall position was still oversupplied, resulting in a sharp easing at one point. The British exchange rate of 6 pence 875 and the US exchange rate of 13.4375 yuan could both be settled. Later, Sassoon bought a large amount, and the price softened slightly, but still lengthened. Trading throughout the day was still strong. The Hong Kong exchange rate initially eased along with the British and American exchange rates to 46.25 yuan, but it tightened slightly after foreign firms bought. As a result, it still lengthened by 75.

Head Position Still Oversupplied

In the morning, the initial situation was that the London big bars were flat in the near and far term, the New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London raw gold also lacked changes. Exchange rates were flat between British and American, between Liu and Shanghai, and between them and France. The US exchange rate was 0.0625 higher against British, 0.05 lower against Shanghai, and flat against France. The central listing prices of various exchange rates remained the same. The banks' morning opening spot selling prices were British gold 6 pence 78125 and US exchange rate 13.25 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British and American exchange rates showed no changes. After the opening, foreign firms came to buy, but Japanese banks and foreign dispatches were eager to sell, causing the market to harden. Japanese banks sold spot British gold to Youli for 6 pence 8125, and then Japanese banks and Indian silver companies competed to sell spot US exchange to foreign banks for 13.3125 yuan and 375. Later, foreign firms settled spot British gold with HSBC. The British gold price was 6 pence 78125, and also purchased and settled spot US exchange from a certain bank for 13.3125 yuan. HSBC's listing price was announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also announced without rising or falling, still collecting 2.75%. After that, Western merchants Sassoon tried to force a purchase, but Chinese banks and foreign Dutch banks sold very actively, and Japanese banks repeatedly sold aggressively. In addition, foreign merchants' banks' appetite for buying was very weak, so the position was several times oversupplied for a while. Therefore, the situation became more and more hardened. Japanese banks and Chinese banks successively sold spot British gold to Sassoon for 6 pence 84375. Then, Japanese banks and Chinese banks competed with foreign Dutch banks to sell spot US exchange to Sassoon, easing from 13.40625 yuan to 4375. Later, Japanese banks sold spot British gold to HSBC, hardening to 6 pence 875. As noon approached, foreign firms also hardened the spot Hong Kong exchange rate to 46.125 yuan. Extended to the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were British gold 6 pence 84375, US exchange rate 13.375 yuan, and Hong Kong exchange rate 46.25 yuan.

Sassoon's Settlement Quantity Not Weak

In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to buy spot US exchange from foreign banks for 13.375 yuan. Then, Japanese banks started selling again, selling spot British gold to Western merchants Sassoon and foreign HSBC for 6 pence 875. The market situation remained hard. Afterwards, foreign banks were very willing to sell British and American exchange rates, resulting in an increasingly easy situation. At that time, foreign firms also bought spot Hong Kong exchange rate from Anta Holland for 46.125 yuan, and the situation softened slightly. Extended to the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were British gold 6 pence 875, US exchange rate 13.40625 yuan. As a result, it lengthened by 0.09375 compared to the British exchange rate of the previous day, and the American exchange rate hardened by 1.5625. The Hong Kong exchange rate was valued at the transaction price and was also cheaper by 0.75. The following is a record of the trades opened throughout the day:

### Demand for Cash Very Strong, Foreign Currencies Fall One After Another

Yesterday, the British pure gold was moving slightly, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.0625. Foreign exchange firms in this port settled a lot, the supply from foreign banks was smooth, Japanese banks were eager to sell, and the market situation was easy. The evening close for British exchange rate was 6 pence 875, easing 0.09375 compared to the previous day, and the US exchange rate was 13.40625 yuan, also easing 1.5625. The gold market opened with the tired momentum of the previous day, trading ten yuan lower. After the opening, exchange tickets eased, gold house customers sold a lot, and buyers' appetite was dull, the falling trend was quite dramatic, once falling to 2,495 yuan. Money changers took the opportunity to absorb slightly, and the market situation stabilized, with the noon close at 2,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the volume of transactions gradually decreased, and the market situation hovered. The evening close did not change. As a result, it fell by 30 yuan compared to the previous day. The supply of British and American gold pounds was relatively smooth, and market prices fell. British and American gold tickets were weak due to the easing of exchange tickets, and customer demand was sluggish, and market prices fell quite sharply. The demand for Hong Kong tickets, French tickets, Singapore tickets, etc., was rare, and all followed the decline. Only Italian tickets had demand and saw a unique increase. Japanese gold tickets were sold, and the market situation has eased, with the evening market at 9 jiao 9 fen 2 li. The demand for Korean tickets was also rare, with the evening market at 9 jiao. In public association trading, only Xiang Kang sold and Xiang Tai bought 100 yuan of American gold tickets. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell 5 jiao, British gold tickets fell 5 jiao, American gold pounds fell 7 jiao, American gold tickets fell 1 jiao 5 fen, Hong Kong tickets fell 1 fen, French tickets fell 3 li, Singapore tickets fell 6 fen, Dutch tickets fell 3 fen, Robbie tickets fell 5 fen, Canadian tickets fell 7 fen, Italian tickets rose 3 fen, Australian gold tickets fell 1 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

Discount Rate Still Outside the 100 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts and bills of exchange was seen to fall back. In the morning, it was around 110 yuan per thousand yuan, and it was not supported until the afternoon, and finally stepped down, retreating to 102.5 yuan, a decrease of 7.5 yuan compared to the previous day's price. The borrowing rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged, with both morning and afternoon markets suspended at 2 jiao 5 fen.

### Securities: Foreign Debt Continues to Fall

The listed prices of London Chinese foreign debts on the 26th of this month (week) have continued to decline. Among the upper-tier debts, the French-American gold (with seal) and the British-French issuance of rehabilitation debts each fell by 3 pounds, the former Zhejiang was 46 pounds, and the latter was 31 pounds. The British-German continued British issuance fell by 2 pounds, the price was 48 pounds, and Crispe fell by 1 pound, the price was 22.5 pounds.

Market transactions included 2,000 pounds of German-French issuance of rehabilitation loans with a seal, with a trading price of 26 pounds. It was also heard that there were also transactions of Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds, with a transaction price of 18 pounds.

The stock market of the Public Industry Association continued to be calm, with few transactions. People's sentiment was waiting and watching, the situation was uncertain, and credit was extremely tight, so that the market could not improve for a while. Only Jardine Matheson shares were still actively traded. The opening price was 18.6 yuan, and the closing price was 18.3 yuan, with a total of 11,000 shares traded. The rubber stock market remained stable, but there were few buyers at present. The company bond market was weak, with a transaction of 83 yuan for the electricity 5.5% bond and 90 shares for the telephone 6% bond.

The listed prices of London British Far East companies' stocks on the 26th of this month (Monday) showed very little fluctuation. The Bank of Macao shares fell by 2 shillings 6 pence, with a price of 7 pounds, and the Kailuan Mining shares rose by 3 pence, with a price of 18 shillings. There were no other changes.

### Industrial and Commercial Discussions on Assistance: Those Hedging Foreign Exchange Should Be Aware

‚Äî Ben

Foreign merchant factories and firms import a batch of raw materials, and must settle the payment for the goods by buying foreign exchange. However, the raw materials cannot be exchanged for money immediately, and there is a shortage of cash positions. They have to entrust domestic banks to come forward, collect credit deposits, sell at low prices in the near term, and buy at high prices in the long term. The interest rate is 2-3%, and the term is limited to one month. This is because they are forced to quench their thirst with poison due to the shortage of funds. General wealthy merchants and financiers are greedy for petty profits and do not hesitate to act as accomplices for tigers, making wedding clothes for others. As the saying goes, "Where there is profit, people flock to it."

Ten days ago: the exchange market changed drastically, and the shilling suddenly shrank, from a listed price of 8 pence 25 softening to 6 pence and a half. The cost increased by 20%, people panicked, and foreign firms aggressively absorbed. In addition, the end of the month was approaching, and the need for funds was urgent. The interest rate reached 5.5%. Sure enough, "under a heavy reward, there must be brave men." Within two or three days, foreign merchants' banks collected this deposit; reaching 8-9 million yuan, both parties established the contract on the same day, and the settlement was at the end of the month (payment). The US dollar was at least 5,000 yuan (equivalent to more than 40,000 legal currency), and as much as 25,000 yuan, or even 50,000 yuan. However, wealthy households from all over the place concentrated on the isolated island, and were confused and did not know where to invest. Now that they heard this news, they all rushed to donate enthusiastically. Therefore, within two or three days, this huge figure was filled. Capitalists only know "profit for themselves," and do not know about national economy and people's livelihood, disrupting the financial system. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Finance's electric message on the 21st instructed to restrict the withdrawal of deposits, which was like a bolt from the blue. In addition to the normal industrial and commercial enterprises that suffered a fish in the pond, they suffered unprovoked losses due to the lack of cash positions, business was sluggish, and buying and selling stopped. Those friends who hedged foreign exchange interest originally wanted to fish in troubled waters, but unexpectedly, things turned out to be unexpected, and the entire deposit in the bank could not be withdrawn (limited to 500 yuan). On the foreign merchant's side, the contracts were established, there were guarantors and brokers, so they were not afraid of you being short. When the time came, they would have to settle the amount as agreed. These two days, they are also so anxious that they have no way out and cannot enter the ground. As a result, they had to raise prices and sell. For example, they used to sell in at 2 fen, but now they raised the price by 3-4 fen to let it out. After signing a contract, they turned around and asked, and the loss was several thousand or tens of thousands, and it was happening to many people. That is really the so-called "lifting a stone and pressing your own foot, losing your wife and losing your army!"

Therefore: I hope that the capitalists who hedge foreign exchange interest can wake up after receiving this severe blow. Instead of being used by others and doing a business that loses money, it is better to invest this money in domestic real factories. On the one hand, it can revitalize industry, benefit the country and the people. At the same time, the interest on their own funds will also have a solid guarantee. Otherwise, if you only know how to take risks and engage in speculation, the result will be losing money for nothing. "Stealing chickens won't cost you rice." What's the point of this!

### Silk Floss & Silver - Emergency in Silver Exchanges - Cotton Yarn Rises and Falls with Cuts - The Perception is that Double Horse Yarn at 9 Yuan from Southern Merchants Continues to Be Procured Endlessly as the Japanese Yarn Market Disappears

Transactions in cotton yarn on the grey market are becoming increasingly active. People's minds are restless and uncertain. There are differing views on whether the market is bullish or bearish, but genuine demand is still considered strong. Merchants from South China, Hong Kong, and Guangdong continue to procure without ceasing, providing substantial support to market prices. At the opening of the market this morning, due to the impact of the silver shortage on generally speculative households, many began cutting losses, causing a noticeable panic in the market, resulting in a straight drop. Spot goods of Double Horse 20s yarn from foreign firms opened at 484 yuan, dropping straight to 473 yuan, a difference of 11 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors of good news boosting the market, and large firms were reportedly buying in, causing the market to recover and rise again. Double Horse 20s yarn from foreign firms initially traded at 475 yuan, 2 yuan higher than in the morning. Shortly after, buying interest surged, with reports that Xie Kang, acting on behalf of a certain party, was purchasing, tightening the market, pushing the price up to 480 yuan. Warehouse receipts were traded at 475 yuan. However, prices fell by 2 yuan by the close of trading. In total, various merchants bought a combined total of 1,395 bales for the day. The market price for Double Horse 20s yarn fell by 9 yuan, Double Globe yarn fell by 7 yuan, and 10s coarse yarn also fell by varying amounts of 3 to 5 yuan. Ningbo Hefeng Factory offered 500 bales of 10s Red Lotus Bee yarn at a price of 408 yuan. Yesterday, 1,400 bales of cotton yarn arrived from Ningbo. Today, 205 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various merchants are recorded on the left:

Guangdong 365 Hong Kong 20

Fellow Traders 888 Total 1,395

The Japanese yarn market is largely disappearing. In reality, the discount rate for banknotes is high, and sales of Japanese yarn have always been conducted entirely on credit, which has a greater impact. As a result, transactions are difficult to settle. The price of Yueqin Wood brand 20s yarn for the current month fell to a low of 370 yuan, but recovered in the afternoon to 375 to 380 yuan.

Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was relatively active in the early morning. However, due to rumors that the government's approved agricultural relief fund included 35 million for cotton export subsidies, and that the government would announce that only new cotton would be eligible for these subsidies, market prices slightly declined. Washington also rumored that the US might exchange American cotton for Soviet manganese, but the details are unknown. Yesterday's New York market resulted in prices remaining flat, with fluctuations of 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by one rupee. Egyptian cotton rose by 3 to 5 points.

Transactions in foreign cotton in Shanghai have shown no improvement recently. Traders are eager to sell, but it is difficult to find buyers. Factories are not only unwilling to buy, but are also actively seeking to cancel contracts for cotton that has already been purchased but not yet shipped. Yesterday, the Yarn Mill Association held its second decision-making meeting at the Wing On Company, inviting foreign cotton firms to participate. However, due to excessive losses from currency swap issues, no progress was made. It is said that discussions will be held again within the day.

### US Cotton Export Subsidies Limited to New Cotton

Transactions in domestic cotton continue to be non-existent, and factory demand is as rare as morning stars. Huashang Xinyu Factory purchased 500 bales of White Rock 20s raw material, with prices 2 to 3 yuan lower than before. This is because the price of yarn has also fallen, naturally pulling the inter-dependent raw cotton into the vortex. As for the price of Indian cotton blocks, they remain in a state of fatigue. Most factories are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude, maintaining a weary and immobile stance. Supplies from northern Jiangsu have decreased, with only 60 bales of Tonghua cotton arriving. Today, 100 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:

Sugar Market: Local refined sugar down half a yuan; Huizhou white sugar up two yuan.

According to the London wire yesterday, the sugar market for August rose by 2.25 pence, to 7 shillings and 6.5 pence. December rose by 0.75, to 6 shillings and 3.25 pence. March of next year rose by 1 penny, to 6 shillings and 4 pence. The Dutch wire reported a rise of 5 cents for the near term, with July and August at 8.60 Dutch guilders. The long term remained unchanged. (The incorrect exchange of near-term and long-term prices the day before should be corrected.) The Timber Market Association's clearing prices showed slight fluctuations. Spot prices for 24 coarse white timber were 28.8 yuan at the native firms and 28.6 yuan at the foreign firms, both down by 0.1 yuan. Re-export goods were 20.5 yuan, down by 0.05 yuan. Da Jin Qian mark high coarse timber was down by 0.3 yuan from the previous day, trading at 29.5 yuan. Taikoo cart white timber was unchanged. Western firms' B mark was 28.7 yuan, totaling 200 bales, but downstream prices were down by another 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. DY brand was 27.5 yuan, HX mark was 27.1 yuan, and H mark red color increased by 0.4 yuan, to 19 yuan. National sugar prices saw a slight reduction in their upward momentum due to reports that the Yongjiang River was again blocked and that the Ou River was also impassable. Once the financial situation stabilizes slightly, there should be official market prices. Local refined white sugar, along with coarse white, has softened in recent days, dropping 0.5 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 was 28.5 yuan, with Nos. 2, 3, and 4 decreasing by 0.5 yuan for each successive grade. Guangdong firms offered several hundred bales of Huizhou white sugar, priced at 26.9 yuan to 25.8 yuan, about 2 yuan higher than before.

### Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Sales Decline Further - Door Sales Less Than Half of Normal - Wenzhou Merchants Suddenly Wire to Stop Shipments - Both Sides Agree to Choose One of Four Methods for East Piece Goods Settlement

National Cloth

Yesterday, due to the sudden telegram from Wenzhou merchants to stop shipments, all declared goods were withdrawn. Sales are becoming increasingly limited. Financial institutions are not allowing overdrafts, and there are no new loans being issued. The market is flooded with inventory, making turnover difficult. Business is very slow, prices are chaotic, and most off-market prices are cheap. Yesterday, Jiangxi merchants purchased over one hundred bales of fine cloth under the Shepherd Boy brand and coarse cloth of various grades from the Ewo Mill. Fine Shepherd Boy cloth was priced at 16.35 yuan for each piece on a full exchange rate basis. Guangdong merchants shipped over two thousand pieces of colored cloth and colored twill to places like Mazhang. Quanzhou merchants also experienced a slight increase in actual sales, with transactions in serge, woolen cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill totaling one thousand several hundred pieces. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan purchased forty bales of fine cloth and fine twill from the Shenxin Fugui brand, and over one thousand pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Purchases on Mokiang Road were extremely scattered. Door sales have sharply declined, reaching less than 50% of normal levels. This shows that the purchasing power of citizens has further declined.

Attached is a comparative table of market prices before and after the market shutdown (items marked with a „ÄÄsymbol are products of Japanese factories).

(Note: The prices of Chang Gui fine cloth and fine twill on the sweet 10th are spot prices, and those on the sweet 17th are factory prices. The payment methods are: „Äá for exchange, „ÄÄfor cash, „ÄÄfor 37 calculation.)

East Piece Goods

The market for white goods remains stagnant. A meeting was convened yesterday, but it adjourned without results. However, with the end of the month approaching, the "rubber ball" goods for this month urgently need to be settled. Some traders have individually contacted each other, and many are choosing to fulfill one of the four methods: "delivery," "settlement," "clearing accounts," or "extension." Off-market transactions in fine cloth and fine twill lack fixed standards. Longtou fine cloth is quoted at 14.5 yuan, and Wufu fine twill is offered at 13.9 yuan.

On the 28th, 6 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen and 54 pieces to Hong Kong. In addition, 30 pieces arrived from Hong Kong on the 27th.

### Grains - Flour Clearly Fixed, Secretly Loose - New Wheat Arrivals Surge Daily

Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market presented an appearance of being clearly fixed but secretly loose. Investigations into local transactions have shown no hope of development since the emergence of the cash issue. Both northern and southern merchants have been unable to operate smoothly due to the war. However, there are rumors that northern merchants have already opened up orders for 40,000 bales, which are said to be forward flour to be delivered in Tianjin. It is also rumored that a certain party has already shipped out 100,000 bales in previous batches. If calculated at an exchange rate of 5 yuan, the factory price has secretly fallen significantly. However, yesterday, manufacturers did not accept exchange payments for local transactions, so small retail transactions in this street still require 4.65 yuan in cash, while the market already shows signs of loosening. Investigations show that 500 bales of flour were exported to Xiamen today, and 400 bales of bran were exported to Hong Kong.

Wheat: Yesterday, the new wheat market continued to soften and decline. Arrivals along the Shanghai-Ningbo road are gradually surging. Wheat from places such as Nanjing, Caishiji, Wuhu, Danyang, and Nanxiang have all been transported here. However, at present, flour mills' interest in purchasing remains weak. Yesterday, Japanese factories slightly inquired, and local streets and wineries also made small purchases. However, those holding the goods are under pressure due to insufficient capital and the hot weather, so they are all willing to sell off their goods for cash. The market showed signs of being unable to support itself and loosened. A total of 1,400 bales of new wheat from various locations were offered for sale, with the highest price being 6.55 yuan. In addition, 500 bales of Nanxiang barley were priced at 5.9 yuan. The market price has fallen by more than 0.1 yuan from before.

### Abundant Rice Market Supply

Jing Rice: Yesterday, the source of supply from various merchants, especially the goods from Hexia, were still blocked by a certain party in Minhang, resulting in a lack of arrivals. However, in addition to nearly 2,000 bales from the Changzhou area, Wuhu Jian rice continued to arrive at the port at a rate of 2,000 to 3,000 bales per day, so Shanghai's rice supply still relied on this route to maintain it. As for the sales market, the shops on this street were still lively yesterday, but suddenly turned dull again. The situation was fatigued, and sellers eager to unload their goods were willing to lower prices to secure sales. However, there was ultimately no turnaround by noon, so prices for both thick and thin Jing rice had already depreciated by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.

Ke Xian Rice: Influenced by the rumors of fixed price transactions for foreign rice, and the Wuhu telegram this morning stating that the local market price had fallen sharply by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, people's hearts softened and they sought to sell off their stockpiles. High-quality Ji Xian rice immediately fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Paddy rice still had some sales in the interior countryside, but only by a small amount of a few cents to 0.1 yuan. A total of 3,000 bales were offered for sale in the general market, mostly purchased by countryside traders in the interior.

Foreign Rice: The spot market suddenly weakened yesterday. There were no inquiries for the original price of 23 yuan. Following the transaction of 300 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice the night before, rumors of a second batch of transactions circulated in the market yesterday. The Saigon rice mentioned yesterday was No. 2 rice, totaling 3,000 tons, sold through the Daufu Foreign Firm for Zhejiang, and purchased by six or seven firms that had initially committed to buying Saigon rice but later reneged.

Glutinous Rice: Prices remained mediocre. In general, this type of market, after the two municipal councils strictly ordered price limits, hoarders disappeared. Only scattered small amounts remained in this street for actual demand. Moreover, due to financial issues and various other factors, cargo owners lacked the ambition to defend their positions. Under these circumstances, there is no possibility of a sharp rise in the rice market, and there may even be a trend towards decline.

Miscellaneous Grains: The market situation has entered a normal track. There are many bean transactions.

Although the transaction volume in the miscellaneous grains market is small, it is entirely for genuine sales. Therefore, the overall market situation is normal, shifting with supply and demand. Prices are mostly in line with buying and selling, and are relatively stable. Yesterday, over 300 bales of Dalian yellow beans were traded, priced at 9.6 yuan, 9.5 yuan, and 9.4 yuan. About 100 bales of Wuhu beans were priced at 9.35 yuan and 9.33 yuan. 150 bales of Hankou trench beans were priced at 9.43 yuan. 200 bales of Jiading white-skinned broad beans were priced at 6.7 yuan and 6.65 yuan. 50 bales of Chongming sand broad beans were priced at 5.85 yuan. 60 bales of Nanxiang green-skinned broad beans were priced at 6.9 yuan, and 30 bales of Pinghu green-black beans were priced at 13.8 yuan.

Regarding export beans, 143 tons were shipped to Bombay today, 16 tons to Columbus, 160 bales to Xiamen, and 280 bales to Hong Kong.

### Coal - Coal Briquettes Increase in Price Three Times in Ten Days

The market price of coal briquettes previously increased by 2 yuan per ton starting on the 9th due to soaring raw material prices. Unexpectedly, it has been repeatedly raised within ten days, reaching a total of 3 yuan, with each increase ranging from 2 to 3 yuan per ton, causing panic and chaos in the market. Non-industry players have also started hoarding. Factories have had to stop issuing orders to curb manipulation. The Coal Briquette Association announced the selling price list a few days ago. Companies selling directly from their own vehicles, Yitai Hing, Guohua, and Dongfang Coal Briquettes, were priced at 36 yuan per ton, with an additional yuan for delivery. Retail prices at stores were set at 2.1 yuan per load, but those with inventory were still selling at prices ranging from 1.9 to 2 yuan.

### Silk and Tea - New Ji Li Silk Sold Gradually

Foreign silk markets rose across the board yesterday. New York raw silk rose by 5 to 6 cents, Shanghai silk rose by 7 to 8 cents but was not sold. Guangdong silk rose by 5 cents, near-term standard silk rose by 6.5 cents, and long-term rose by 1.5 cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by 20 yuan and long-term prices rose by 19 yuan.

The local silk market remains sluggish. White factories have slightly negotiated spot transactions. New Ji Li silk has already been gradually sold. Yesterday, Dachang and other firms traded nearly 50 loads, with silk prices showing little change. On the 28th, 283 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to Europe.

### Imports and Exports - More Goods from Ningbo

Yesterday's incoming goods to Shanghai included 853 bags of sugar shipped from Hong Kong, 645 bags from Shantou, and 1,150 bags from Xiamen. Goods transported from Ningbo included 710 bags of cottonseed, 1,500 pieces of cottonseed cake, 3,000 bags of cottonseed flour, 1,529 pieces of fresh eggs, 42 bags of silkworm cocoons, 132 pieces of tung oil, and 7 pieces of human hair. Regarding exported goods, 149 tons of egg yolk and egg white, and 15 tons of gallnuts were shipped to London, and 175 pieces of egg yolk and egg white were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Classical Chinese and Modern Chinese

‚Äî Yang Jinhao

The writing of an era expresses the spirit of that era. The content (views) and form (tone) of writing should conform to the spirit of the times: this has already become common sense.

However, much of the writing prevalent in our country today has not yet achieved this common sense. Some modern people insist on using classical Chinese to write about the views of ancient people, some use classical Chinese to write about the views of modern people, and some use modern Chinese to write about the views of ancient people. The first type is like a walking corpse, the second is like a living ghost of modern times, and the third is like a mummy in disguise: none of them deserve to be called true "modern Chinese"‚Äîthe writing of the new era.

Currently, the second type of writing is the most prevalent: possessing a modern soul but acting like a living ghost, making it difficult for people to understand, truly making oneself ridiculous.

However, it would be fine if they were only ridiculing themselves: but they happen to occupy a considerable position in society, forcing a group of energetic young people to expend much energy to figure out those ghostly forms and shadows, and even to follow them and imitate their ghostly voices. That's a real sin!

In order to save the energy of cultural youths, so that it is not wasted on wrong paths but used for deeper accomplishments; and also to allow the masses who do not have much money to learn that ancient tone and style to be able to acquire knowledge and express their feelings: I want to request that all adults and gentlemen eliminate the remnants of classical Chinese and expand the modern Chinese movement:

(1) All university and high school entrance examinations should be limited to writing in modern Chinese: that is, to use modern language to write about modern views. Some university or high school Chinese language teachers insist on using old antiques from the Four Books and Five Classics, and even the graders only look at classical Chinese papers and not vernacular papers. Such a habit of forcing young students to go backwards must be vigorously eliminated!

(2) All official documents, whether reports, consultations, orders, or approvals, especially government announcements and orders, should abolish all old official styles and be rewritten entirely in vernacular.

(3) All social applied writing, whether letters, deeds, advertisements, invitations, etc., should abolish all inherited clich√©s and be rewritten entirely in vernacular.

(4) News and articles in newspapers and magazines should be written in vernacular to promote and popularize it.

Some people say that writing in classical Chinese is economical. In fact, this is not necessarily true. For example, a news item says: "... This question believes that the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident is very slim..." Rewritten in vernacular, it can be written as: "Here, it is believed that there is little hope for a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident," isn't it also possible to save a word? Many morbid moans, or new antiques full of clich√©s, watch them shake their heads and wag their tails without saying anything sensible, that's extremely uneconomical! Therefore, whether an article is economical depends on whether its content is substantial and whether the language is verbose. Moreover, writing in vernacular allows the author to save the preparatory work of learning to write classical Chinese, and the effort of translating vernacular into classical Chinese when writing; and it also allows the reader to save the effort of learning to read classical Chinese, and the effort of translating classical Chinese into vernacular when reading. Isn't that much more economical than writing in classical Chinese? "The literary revolution" has been advocated for more than twenty years, and yet many young students still demand to learn classical Chinese, and our country's education has still not been truly popularized; this is entirely because the new antiques prevalent in society‚Äîclassical Chinese‚Äîare at work. Therefore, I urge the educational authorities, government officials, and leaders from all walks of life to issue decrees or advocate writing in modern Chinese as soon as possible. When those new antiques lose their basis in society, then the modern Chinese that conforms to the spirit of the times will naturally rise and become popular, and the "literary revolution" and "revolutionary literature" will naturally achieve further victories.

Although the above repeats old words, it is still worth shouting loudly. I hope everyone "knows and acts," and works hard in a down-to-earth manner.

‚Äî‚ÄîField Notes‚Äî‚Äî

There are two routes from Shangcheng into Anhui: one is from Yuzidian to Huiqi Mountain, passing through Sidao River, which is twenty li away, which is a relatively flat main road; the other is from Sizhuadun to Suxianshi, crossing Huangtu Ridge and reaching Zao Xie He, which is the nearest shortcut, but the road is winding, the mountain slopes are steep, and it cannot be done without walking. We arrived in Shangcheng from Songbu at about 9 pm. Although there was a truck from the military supervision department to take us, we still had to get out of the car and wade through the vast stony beaches where mountain streams converged. Otherwise, if the wheels played around with the stones, you would be sure to hold a "baptism ceremony." That night, we stayed at the Dahua Hotel next to the county government. In Shangcheng, it was considered a first-class hotel, with paper windows, uneven dirt floors, and old bamboo beds, all preserving the style of the Middle Ages. However, the inferiority of the material conditions can reflect the simplicity of social life: the hard work and endurance of the people of Zhongzhou can be seen here. Moreover, the people are strong and brave. Since this resolution of organization, training, and the inculcation of political common sense, in the voice of "defend our homeland," they are all ready to rub their fists and prepare to spill their blood.

Mr. Zhang Naiqi of the Anhui Provincial Committee also stayed in Shangcheng that day; this familiar national fighter had returned to Anhui from Wuhan, passing through here, so we met. He wore a worn-out gray cloth uniform, pacing back and forth in the courtyard, and no one knew that he was a high-ranking official.

"Ah, where are you going?" He seemed a little surprised.

"Anhui," I replied, "to western Anhui!" I immediately added a sentence.

"Then shall we travel together?"

"No, we may want to go to Xinyang for investigation."

Then, he told us about the mobilization work of the masses here, expressing very satisfied excitement. Finally, he said that for the 150-li mountain road to Anhui, one would have to rely on a pair of feet, because western Anhui was short of both salt and rice, and it was necessary to mobilize civilians to prepare for a rainy day, so hiring sedan chairs was absolutely impossible.

Somehow, County Magistrate Chen Shouchang actually discovered the arrival of Mr. Zhang. Early the next morning, he came to Dahua to invite him to give a speech. We were also involved together. After the speech, we toured the entire city. This ancient county town on the border of Henan, surrounded by less than ten li, seemed very quiet because it was located in the war zone: but the people's emotions about the war of resistance were extremely tense, which could be proved by the impression gained from the lecture meeting. It is said that the old six counties belonging to Guangzhou, Henan, have always done a good job in civilian defense work due to the banditry that has plagued them for years. The baojia system is also quite complete. When the mobile war begins, Shangcheng's people's armed forces will immediately be brought into play to serve as the gatekeepers of western Anhui, which is more than enough. As proof, Shangcheng has been occupied for half a year, but the bandits have never crossed the Zao Xie He even one step. Although relying on natural dangers, it also relies on human power. Who says political work is not important?

In the silent and lonely night,

No sound of pedestrians is heard;

The mournful bugle call

Accompanies the long howl of the west wind.

Scattered over the sentry's camp.

In the clashing sound of iron helmets,

Many people shout:

"Let us rise up,

Formerly, learning to fly necessarily required being in the air. Now, one can learn the methods of operation and gain the correct sensation of flying simply in a small machine on the ground. This should be credited to a new technique invented by a young man named Link of New York.

The Link Trainer is installed in an airtight chamber and controlled by powerful bellows. Except for the inability to fly, it can match a real airplane in every aspect and can use automatic equipment to accurately simulate all kinds of dangers in flight‚Äîsuch as wing icing, air resistance, etc. One will also lose altitude or enter a whirlwind just as one would in a real airplane. An incautious learner, if confined in this trainer for too long, will also experience dizziness like a skilled pilot who has been in the air for too long, requiring assistance to exit the machine upon landing.

The public knows too little about the Link Trainer, but it is considered standard equipment by the U.S. Aviation Trade Bureau and the Army and Navy. The Army currently possesses twenty-five of these devices. European and American commercial airlines also use this trainer to train their pilots, practice flying, and subject them to dangerous experiments at any time.

Link's first trainer was built in a corner of his father's organ factory. He adopted the pneumatic method used for the organ's bellows equipment. He now manufactures this device in two factories, one in Binghamton, New York, and the other in Gananoque, Ontario, Canada. In January of this year, due to a rush of orders from around the world, he quadrupled the production capacity of his Binghamton factory. The Canadian factory is currently rushing to complete orders worth a total of $1.25 million for customers throughout the British Empire. The cheapest of these trainers costs $6,000 each, and the most expensive costs $10,000 each. Link is only thirty-five years old this year, and his net worth is already close to a million. This inventor did not receive technical training in school. His experience comes from careful learning in his own factory. The manufacture of organs differs from most industrial manufacturing; its driving force is compressed air. Link focused on studying this force from childhood.

At the age of twenty-three, he engaged in aviation amidst the enthusiasm for aviation sparked by Lindbergh's flight to Paris. Soon, he was teaching people to fly. But flying may be considered a stressful matter on the student's part, while for the teacher, this task can quickly become a routine. A busy man like Link, engaged in this every day, found it very painful, so he conceived of a method to cultivate flying experience on the ground. He spent the winter months between 1927 and 1928 experimenting with bellows, vents, and the supporting power of air in the organ factory. By spring, he had solved this problem. He was able to create a trainer whose every movement was like that of a real airplane. Link then founded an aviation school, where anyone who agreed to pay a tuition fee of $85 could be guaranteed graduation. In 1931, the school had 150 students, but in 1932, he felt frustrated because the number of students gradually decreased, leading the school to experience losses.

At the same time, the number of trainers he sold was insufficient to sustain his plans: only a few were bought by aviation transportation agencies, and the number sold abroad was also scarce: only a few in the UK, and the rest sold in other parts of Europe. In 1930, the Navy purchased one, and the Army ordered six.

His main income, however, came from various amusement parks; he and his brother George used the trainers to perform various aviation shows in the parks. On one occasion, George was embarrassed by the audience. It turned out that they wanted to climb into the cockpit to start the machines. Link came up with a solution: he asked the audience to pay money as a reward, and then take turns "flying" in the trainer for a quarter of an hour. The audience willingly paid and took turns riding, leaving satisfied. After that, the performance venue set a visiting fee, and the daily ticket income was considerable, so his factory was able to sustain itself and grow day by day.

In 1934, the cancellation of airmail contracts and the accidents encountered by the Army Air Corps pilots flying mail planes made the aviation community realize the need for mechanical training‚Äîthis was a matter that could not be delayed. Then Link's opportunity arrived. Day after day, people came to inquire about the use of the trainer. Since the end of 1934, the production in his factory has been increasing day by day.

When you enter a Link Trainer, you can feel as if you are in a real airplane. When you "ascend," the instruments clearly indicate the same as those indicated by a rising airplane. Once the airplane is in the air, you must manage altitude and fly forward, being unstable in the air. The trainer also has these sensations. Except for the inability to move forward, the trainer can realize all the fears and possibilities of flying. If one wing droops, the driver will immediately feel it, and the artificial horizon will also remind the driver. Increasing or decreasing altitude, turning left and right, all are available.

Pains Beyond Words

‚Äî ÊùéÈü∂Âπ¥
By Li Shaonian

I occasionally have some free time, so I go to chat with a friend. Since we are both young literature enthusiasts, our conversations inevitably revolve around literature. Then we launch into a round of reckless discussions targeting the current bleak state of this isolated island. After sitting for a while, I pick up a copy of Lu Yan's "The Traveler's Heart" from his bookshelf and take my leave. The motivation for taking this book is simply that I am also a traveler. I just want to see what the heart of a so-called "traveler" is like, whether we share the same emotions that permeate our states of mind.

I go home. I leaf through "The Traveler's Heart." On it, I discover my friend's afterthoughts, an eight-line poem, titled "Pains Beyond Words":

On the white paper, a small circle is drawn,

Can you escape the longing for your hometown?

Oh, traveler's heart!

Falling into a small circle of pain,

Hoping for all comfort to come,

You look up and wait,

The bitter, suffocated traveler's heart,

Only seeking to enlarge that circle of life!

My friend reveals his homesickness in these eight lines, unable to conceal it.

But what about the hometown?

Under the fires of war, the hometown‚Äîhis and mine‚Äîapart from merely a terrain resembling a rubble pile, there is only the remnant of broken tiles and bricks. Thinking of this, the symptoms of homesickness naturally become even heavier. Sometimes, one cannot help but consign some unspeakable pain between the lines, just to ease one's mind, but the melancholy still remains.

In fact, he lacks a firm "belief." I would never let unspeakable pain grow in my heart and gnaw at it. If things continue to develop like this, he will sink into the most severe mental illness, never able to extricate himself. To put it bluntly, he is engaging in slow suicide.

"The final victory belongs to us!" We abandon this unspeakable pain and make silent hopes and efforts, only then can we enlarge that circle of life, isn't that so? President Chiang announces to us: "One person's life is finite, but the life of the nation is infinite!" We must enlarge an even greater circle! (Proceeds from the sale will be donated)

The Yang Yuelou Abduction Case

There was a woman named Wang, from Wu [Suzhou], who followed the merchant Zhang with her quilt and silk. Zhang traveled to Fuliang to sell tea and did not return for years. Spring flowers and autumn moons passed, and Wang was already a middle-aged beauty. She had a daughter, about to reach the age of fifteen, still waiting to be betrothed, indeed perfectly flawless. In the Spring Theater Company there was a Yang Yuelou, who had a rather imposing appearance. Many famous courtesans flocked to him. Wang, in the lamplight of the third watch, at the end of a performance, also felt longing for him. But being elderly, she was too ashamed to recommend herself, so she used her young daughter as bait. Wang had an adopted daughter named A Shi, seventeen years of age, young and beautiful. Marrying her to Yang would be a union between two families. She wouldn't have to worry about gossip. Yang hesitated because of public opinion and dared not proceed with the marriage. Thus, on the first day of the month, just as dawn broke, while people were still asleep, Wang secretly carried A Shi out. Yang was waiting with a carriage for the beauty to board. With a flick of the whip, the carriage was gone, leaving no trace. At noon, Wang carried several large and small lacquered red boxes out, and as the sun set, she left and did not return. Zhang's family sent out scouts in all directions. The next day, they learned that Yang Yuelou was renting a place in Wenyun Lane. They immediately reported to the Guangbang Guild Hall and formally lodged a complaint with the authorities about the abduction. On the third day, Magistrate Chen immediately sent constables. The doors were closed during the day, and the constables broke in through a hole in the wall. Yang Yuelou jumped from the upper floor, caught off guard, and was captured. Wang and her adopted daughter, along with seven large and small leather suitcases, were taken into custody. At the trial, the onlookers were like a wall. The plaintiff was Wei, a relative of Wang, who recounted the abduction in detail. Yang Yuelou was summoned to face the court. Magistrate Chen, considering that the actor had enticed and abducted a woman from a good family, a heinous crime, immediately sent him to the county for further investigation. The next night, during the night trial, Yang was subjected to a hundred strokes to the feet. Wang was given two hundred lashes to the back. When questioned, A Bao stated that she would follow her husband like a hen follows a rooster and had no other intentions. She was also given two hundred strokes, and when asked about how she met Yang, she said that her mother had played matchmaker after they watched a play together. Magistrate Ye ruled that Yang had committed more than one crime. Previously, he was also a principal offender in the mass brawl at the Little East Gate. It was ordered that he be detained for further questioning.

After the Restriction on Withdrawals

‚Äî ÂºµÈéÆÂ±±
By Zhang Zhenshan

The "Ma Electric" [an announcement by Ma Yin-ch'u], like a clap of thunder, extending to Shanghai, caused the ambitions of speculators to tremble; shattered the illusions of those hoping to evade capital; and at the same time, turned those who hoarded and manipulated prices into "heroes" with no place to use their skills, thus hopefully stabilizing and lowering the general standard of living. While we applaud this, shouldn't we laugh at those with "big bellies and wild ambitions" and watch their predicament with arms folded?

After the restriction on withdrawals, large depositors were indeed unable to withdraw unlimited amounts. However, these days, the banks have been extremely crowded with depositors withdrawing funds, both large and small account holders. I visited several large banks and browsed in the savings departments. In each one, the crowds of people were layered and wriggling under the windows outside the counters, waving their passbooks or receipts. The scene was like the ticket sales before a popular play in the theater. The clerks inside the counter were as busy as ticket sellers. The thunderous wind kept blowing, but it could not dispel the heat wave, nor could it disperse the sour sweat odor squeezed out of the crowd. This grand occasion was indeed unprecedented. Several savings departments even temporarily added window openings and transferred more staff to cope with the situation. Rolls of banknotes were being pushed out of the windows, some with tens of yuan, some with one or two hundred yuan, and many with five hundred yuan. Accumulating like grains of sand into a pagoda, the total number must be quite large.

The restriction on withdrawals originally stipulated that amounts below 500 yuan were not restricted. However, why were those small depositors also joining in the excitement? This may be attributed to rumors. The people who stir up trouble are ubiquitous. Once there is an opportunity, they will not stop using their "eloquence." Coupled with the fact that foreign banks are not bound by the ministry's orders and can pay depositors the full amount of cash, this has given the general public, especially the petite bourgeoisie, the idea of transferring their funds. These days, it's hard to believe that people withdrawing money are using it to maintain their livelihoods.

At the same time, many of those so-called small depositors are actually not purely small depositors, but rather those transformed from large sums. This is already an open secret. Since the announcement of the "August 16th" financial stabilization measures two years ago, their funds have almost all escaped the restriction and become cash holdings. Because of the experience that small amounts are unrestricted and easier to withdraw, many wealthy people are dividing their large sums into several small amounts, creating many account names, such as: Zhang San, Li Si, Zhao Wu, Sun Liu, Zhou Qi, Wang Ba; and even names like Tian Ji, Di Ji, Ren Ji, Gui Ji, etc., coming and going, like a cunning rabbit having three burrows. Therefore, although the restriction on withdrawals is set at 500 yuan, they can withdraw an unknown number of 500 yuan each week, as long as they have enough account names, it is not difficult to turn it all into cash.

However, where do they put all this cash? The "smart" ones have their own ways, truly not worrying about the dangers of hoarding and inviting theft. In addition to transferring it to cash accounts, most people buy foreign exchange and deposit it in foreign banks, and some even actively purchase gold and silver, or try to hoard goods.

In addition, many people use safe deposit boxes to hide their cash. They take it out of the savings or current account and immediately put it into the safe deposit box they rent in the same bank. When they need to use it, they take it out, which is extremely convenient.

These selfish actions have a huge negative impact on the monetary system and social financial institutions, and it is even more regrettable that the general purely small depositors listen to the rumors of speculators! Generally, ambitious people or selfish people with capital should prioritize the interests of the nation and society to assist the government in stabilizing finances and the market, in order to increase the economic strength of the war of resistance. I know that saying this is like "playing the lute to a cow," but I am not willing to remain silent. I don't have time to worry about whether it has any effect, of course.

Written Before the Opening of the "Labor Exhibition"

‚Äî ‰∫ûË∑Ø
By Ya Lu

"Self-reliant education is what is called labor education" Research and create to adapt to the purpose of "learning for application"

The middle and primary school labor exhibition initiated by the Municipal Private School Association is scheduled to open on July 4th. It is said that the scale is very large, and the proceeds from the sale of works will be used for disaster relief donations. This kind of "labor exhibition" with great significance is really unprecedented in the isolated island's education circle.

The bad habit of readers being clumsy with their hands and feet, and laborers not knowing how to think, and not being willing to use both hands and brain, is indeed one of the reasons for our country's backward production. Since Zhenfu [Huang Yanpei] advocated labor education in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], there have indeed been many outstanding achievements, but it is feared that there are also not a few schools that simply add one or two hours of manual courses such as earth, wood, bamboo, and paper each week as decoration. Even a few schools, when they encounter an exhibition, have to take the opportunity to hope to win praise and compete for face, and do not hesitate to buy a few ready-made things at any cost and then repackage them for display. This kind of hypocrisy that cannot produce real value is really the misfortune of the education community. For the sake of the value of education and the essence of labor, I hope that the schools participating in this middle and primary school labor exhibition must be realistic and not think that society can be deceived.

A famous educator once said: "Self-reliant education is what is called labor education." Because if we can make good use of our clever brains and omnipotent hands to manufacture something, as long as it meets human needs, then from the national point of view, there is no need to rely on foreign goods and let capital flow out; from the individual point of view, having a skill will not make one a social parasite or encounter possible difficulties in life.

The main purpose of labor education in schools is to gradually cultivate students' interest and skills in the mechanical industry; at the same time, labor education can also fully promote the national spirit. I saw some works in the middle and primary school labor exhibition in the previous year, which were rich in the meaning of "recovering lost land" and "Chinese patriotism," which of course is very able to stimulate national consciousness, and it was exciting to see.

It is expected that this time, the middle and primary school students will exhibit their elaborate works, which must be very meaningful and very valuable, but do not think that this is enough. We must deeply recognize that after the War of Resistance, our country's great cause of rejuvenation will depend on talents with specialized skills in all aspects of construction. Therefore, on the one hand, we must enrich knowledge of science, mathematics, and manufacturing-related patterns, and on the other hand, we must adapt to the purpose of "learning for application" and make good use of our hands and brains to continuously research, create, and invent.

Finally, I hope that the social gentry and ladies will enthusiastically go to visit and appreciate the "Labor Exhibition" during the opening days, and give honest criticism. At the same time, I hope that they can generously donate and buy some favorite things. In that case, the suffering compatriots will also benefit a lot.

Episode 13: Urging Study, Farming, and Storing Materials for the Country, Retaining the Strong and Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds with a Field

He Shuangyu said, "Then this silkworm breeding farm has broken the plan of the Free Village not setting up factories." Zhu Fuzhang said, "Although everyone had this tacit understanding at the time, there was no rule set that the Free Village was not allowed to set up factories, because at that time no one thought of competing for land in the Free Village to set up a factory. And the people in the Free Village are all engaged in farming, and no one thought of setting up a factory. When the Provincial Agricultural Bureau sent someone to negotiate with our village, our village held various meetings and felt that we could not refuse him. Does the Free Village only allow a few people from the Free Village to live there, and not allow others to start a business? Is this kind of closed-door mentality allowed to exist in this world? Moreover, the breeding farm does not hinder our village in any way, and the Agricultural Bureau is also considering the development of the silkworm industry. Good seeds are beneficial to silkworm farmers. I remember when our Jiangsu Province's silkworm farming area was lost, the silkworm seeds were almost controlled by others. Until now, the silkworm seeds in Zhejiang and Jiangsu have gradually become excellent. There is also a saying that the breeding farm cannot be considered a purely factory; it is still an agricultural farm. At that time, it was resolved to agree. Fortunately, they do not occupy much land, and it is not necessary to be in a place with land and water transportation. The seeds produced last year were of good quality, and this year they have doubled. Who knew that double would not be enough? It is said that the seeds scheduled for next year have exceeded this year's output by one and a half times. In this way, their houses are not enough again, and they are adding to them there." He Shuangyu said, "The breeding farm is probably only busy during the silkworm season, right? After the silkworm season, it will be idle. Like now, it is idle time." Zhu Fuzhang said, "That's not necessarily true. In the past, it was originally like this. Farmers have a fixed lunar calendar. As long as they are busy through the early summer, the silkworm business is over. The ancient people's poems say, "After the silkworm and mulberry are finished, then plant the fields," which just happens to be in order, and after being busy in the early days, they are busy in the middle days. However, now silkworms are raised in the spring and summer; after the summer silkworms are raised, they are raised in the autumn. Except for the winter, when the mulberry leaves are not withered, silkworms can be raised in the other three seasons. In order to raise silkworms in three seasons, the breeding farm must prepare silkworm seeds for three seasons, so they are still not very idle. However, summer and autumn silkworms are not as many as spring silkworms. Just like in our village, we only raise spring silkworms, but they don't raise silkworms for the other two seasons. And besides raising silkworms and feeding mulberry, there is also a lot of other work to do. The seed selection part requires a lot of people. They all have to be specialized people, all of whom have graduated from silkworm industry schools. These jobs are all done by ladies!" (148)

Household Goods Exchange

‚Äî ÁéâÂÖ®
By Yu Quan

A movement to trade waste materials, all kinds of household application items are available.

Recently, the increase in the cost of living in Shanghai is unprecedented. Needless to say, rents, other things like rice, oil, vegetables, clothing, and all daily necessities, have suddenly increased in price. For example, bok choy, not long ago sold for only three or four cents a catty, now requires 20 copper coins. Matches are now sold for two cents a box‚Ä¶ No matter what the item, the price has reached an abnormal height. Life on this isolated island is currently extremely difficult!

The cost of living continues to increase, but we must think of a way to save it. I have always advocated that in addition to doing our best to save, we should promote a waste exchange movement. The practical method is to exchange my waste for others‚Äô waste that I need. In this way, there is no need to buy it with money, but to promote this movement, it must be expanded in scope in order to be effective.

Now a service agency that meets the above conditions has appeared, that is, the "Household Goods Exchange" recently attached to the Shanghai Women's and Youth Service Department on Jing'an Temple Road in the YWCA, and it is completely a service nature. However, it only sells new and old items on behalf of others, but we can bring our own unused items to consign there. The money earned can then be used to buy our own needed items there, so aren't the waste products that everyone doesn't need all exchanged for practical items? I think the establishment of this agency is very suitable for the current needs. I am happy that this is the gospel that the residents of the isolated island are happy to hear, and even more joyfully comforts my hope that it has now been realized.

Walking into the agency, it is really like being in a department store. All the items that should be used in the family are there, and they are displayed by category, such as silk, cloth, clothing for all seasons, shoes and hats, Chinese clothing, Western clothing, toys, both new and old are available. Each item is marked with a price. These items are all consigned from the outside world, and the agency only charges some handling fees necessary for expenses.

The most commendable thing about the agency is that both new and old goods can be sold on consignment. Then from now on, if there are extra items at home, it is a pity to discard them, so we can entrust them to the agency for sale, which is more cost-effective than selling them to old goods collectors. At the same time, if we lack any items, buying new ones is not enough economic power, and buying old ones is not easy to buy, then we can go there to choose and buy. Fortunately, everything is available there, and the prices also have a certain standard, and you will never suffer a loss. It is really both convenient and economical.

Since the opening of the "Household Waste Exchange," it has been quite crowded with consignors and buyers, which shows how much the agency is needed! We hope that people who are enthusiastic about social welfare will come together to initiate and set up several item exchange agencies with the same nature, which will at least reduce the burden on the lives of the residents of the isolated island.

Bidding Farewell to Mao and Welcoming Yan

Since the beginning of the era, the Golden Company originally intended to retain Gao Shenglin, Guan Shengxi, and Qiu Shengrong of the "Sheng" generation, and pair them with Yan Jupeng, who had been performing since the previous era. Among them, Guan Shengxi had already been in Shanghai for a long time since he came with Zhang Eyun the previous time, and his heart was set on returning home, so he did not want to continue performing in Shanghai. Gao Shenglin, Qiu Shengrong, and the young actor Jiang Shiyu remained. The reason why the Golden Company wanted to keep a group of people was that Yan Jupeng did not bring many supporting actors. Besides the female role Hao Zhu and Hou Yulan, there were only Ma Yunkun and Wang Fushan. Now, let's talk about Hou, Ma, and Wang for the time being:

Hou Yulan

Ms. Hou is twenty-one years old this year. Her father's name is Yueting, and he is an amateur performer. Yulan loved Peking opera since she was a child. When the Peking Opera School was established, Yulan enrolled in the school. The school produced many talents, especially Zhao Jinrong, Song Dezhu, and Hou Yulan among the female roles, who are truly rare talents in recent times. Yulan is excellent in both character and academics. She took the exam three times and always came out on top. The principal of the opera school, Jin Zhong, praised her as the most outstanding talent in the school. Zhao Jinrong and Song Dezhu left the school before Yulan. After Zhao and Song left, Yulan held the fort alone and became the mainstay of the school. Last winter, Yulan also graduated. She originally intended to form her own troupe, but it did not work out for some reason. Then, she was invited by the Sheng actor Xi Xiaobo. Since Yulan started working with Xiaobo, her reputation has grown even more, showing a remarkable progress. Because Yulan is a disciple of Cheng Yushuang, people in old Beijing often called her "Female Inkstone Partner." Yulan's art was personally taught by Yushuang, and she gained a lot of experience in learning the Cheng style. Yulan's performances of Cheng's masterpieces are vivid and lifelike, almost indistinguishable from Yushuang's. Yulan's voice is very sweet, and her appearance is also excellent. This time, coming with Jupeng, she will definitely be very popular among the people of Shanghai.

Ma Liankun

Liankun specializes in "Jiazi Hua" (painted face roles). He was a student of the "Fu Liancheng" opera school and was considered a top student in the second class. Among the "Jiazi Hua" talents from Fu Liancheng, Hou Xirui was the first to become popular. After Hou, there was only Liankun. (There were many "Jiazi Hua" talents in the second class of Fu Liancheng, including Wang Lianpu, Liu Lianrong, and Su Lianhan, among whom Ma Liankun was the first to emerge.) Liankun's art combines the strengths of Hou (Xirui) and Hao (Shouchen). His "Jiazi" demeanor is the best. He also has considerable skill in martial arts, and his singing and reciting are also commendable. Liankun's "white-faced" plays have a good reputation. His art is suitable for working with Sheng actors. Several years ago, Tan Fuying relied on him as his right-hand man. Now that he is coming with Jupeng, I can't help but congratulate Jupeng, because with Liankun, he will definitely achieve the effect of green leaves complementing the peony.

Wang Fushan

Fushan specializes in "Chou" (clown roles). He is the son of Wang Shuanzi (Changlin), a descendant of a prominent family, not comparable to ordinary people. Fushan's art was personally taught by Shuanzi, so he is proficient in both civil and martial arts. Fushan's art is above the average clown actors of the younger generation. Although his voice is not loud, it has strength. He is at a disadvantage because of his height, and his appearance is not attractive. However, his martial arts are excellent, and his movements are flexible. Fushan followed his father's footsteps and played with Yang Xiaolou, so he had more opportunities to perform martial clown roles than civil clown roles. Therefore, Fushan's martial clown plays are better than his civil clown plays. Although his civil clown plays are also worth watching, he is better at performing mischievous plays. It may be difficult for him to satisfy people in the "robe and belt" clown roles. Judging from Yan Jupeng's repertoire, it would be best to pair him with Yao Cirui or Quan Rudanghui for clown roles. Fushan does not seem to be the right match.

The above three are the supporting actors who came with Yan Jupeng. It seems that there is a lack of an inside old man. However, the Golden Company has a large number of talents, so there should be no difficulty. As for Jupeng's arrival, it is expected to cause a sensation. Jupeng has not been seen in Shanghai for ten years, let alone his heroic appearance ten years ago. In terms of Jupeng's art, he is truly worthy of being called the "Orthodox Tan School" and "Unique in Rhythm." Fuying is good, but to hear a Sheng play with a truly Tan flavor, Jupeng is definitely the best. Recently, Sheng actors Nanlin (Lintong) and Beima (Lianliang) are the most popular. No one intends to revive the Tan style. Listening to Jupeng's singing, we will surely have a refreshing experience.

### Dorothy Lamour Wears Chinese Fashion on the Screen

Ms. Li Xiaqing Lent Her Clothes

Paramount Company Did Not Spend a Cent

The famous Hollywood actress Miss Dorothy Lamour belongs to Paramount Pictures. Recently, the company is filming "Disputed Passage." In the film, Miss Lamour plays an American orphan raised by Chinese foster parents, so she will wear Chinese women's costumes to perform on the screen. With such a graceful Western beauty, plus oriental costumes, we imagine that this fusion of Chinese and Western virtues will definitely have a unique peak.

As for the Paramount Company authorities, they did not spend a cent for Miss Lamour's "Chinese costumes," because our Chinese female aviator Ms. Li Xiaqing is currently flying across the United States. In addition to her life in the air, she also travels around Hollywood, spending her silver lamp life. In this film, she is making her debut. Her friendship with Miss Lamour is very good, as close as sisters. Their body shapes and sizes are similar, so borrowing clothes is not a problem. It is said that Ms. Li has more than a hundred Chinese-style clothes, such as cheongsams, which is enough for Miss Lamour to choose and use.

### Pure Scientific Underwater Film

‚Äî New Film

‚Äî‚ÄîNow Showing Everywhere in the Soviet Union

Recently, a Soviet scientific blockbuster "The Depth of the Sea" has been completed and is being screened in major cities in the Soviet Union. All the shots in this film were taken underwater, all of which are the dynamics of marine life. The film's photographer wore swimming clothes and dived into the seabed, using a microscopic camera to capture the structure of the smallest organisms under the sea. The interest is particularly focused on tassels, flounders, needlefish, and the mimicry of crabs, especially the methods of changing mimicry at different depths below the seabed. However, some accidental events are not easy to capture on camera, such as the sea anemone unfolding to capture small fish, mostly in dark places. However, hunger sometimes forces them to change their habits and snatch food in bright places. In this way, the photographer gets the opportunity to capture the snatching action on camera. This film was directed by three famous professors of experimental biology, Libiteff, Vodensky, and Nikitin. Although it is a purely scientific film, in the Soviet Union, which advocates science, such a film will give everyone the opportunity to see it.

### A Brief Discussion of Yan Shishan

‚Äî Sheweng

Yan Shishan, the martial female lead of the Golden Company, has a longer performance period this time and will return to Beiping with Mao Shilai. Now, let's briefly talk about everything about her.

Shishan is the niece of Jiujin Feng and inherited from her family. Although she graduated from a formal opera school, she also has a family education. Her appearance and movements are rarely matched. Her art is extremely beautiful. Plays such as "The Hujia Village" and "Stealing the Treasure Herb" are her masterpieces. Her "Dachu Shou" (fighting scenes) are also complete, stable and clean. If she had not had a solid foundation, how could she have achieved this? It is a pity that many martial female lead plays have not been staged. The repertoire of the Golden Company is too dense, so many plays cannot be staged in time. Her salary is very unclear. Shishan's voice is already brighter than Chun Kui, and she often practices singing long passages to train her voice. She also learns some Qingyi and Huadan plays and can learn them wholeheartedly. Everyone who knows her says that she will soon compete with Shi Lai and Song Dezhu on the stage. It is expected that after she returns to Beiping, she will focus on shirt plays. When she comes to Shanghai again in the future, she will surely change her style. Her friend Lv Gong has high expectations for her, because her material is excellent, and she is truly the only one in the younger generation. I once took a photo of her performing at the Golden Company to leave an impression for those who love Yan.

### Anecdotes of the Opera World

‚Äî Xu Muyun

The Fall of Layman Woyun and the Progress of Li Duokui

When he shared the stage with Yan Jupeng, the Zaqu world praised their acting and recitation for being very similar to the old masters. Sometimes his voice was clear, and he cut corners, but the audience still did not make a fuss or boo him. However, he later felt guilty and was embarrassed to continue singing, so he soon resigned. Since the death of the old master and the fall of Woyun, Li Duokui has unintentionally become the leader in the Laodan (old female) scene. At the same time, since the deaths of Fu Shan, Wen Liangchen, and the work-based Lao Dan, only Chen Wenqi and Sun Futing remain. It is also said that Mr. Lu Wu is now nearly seventy years old. Among those who specialize in Lao Dan's Huqin (Chinese violin), no one has been heard of inheriting Lu's mantle until now, which is also a great regret in the opera world. Li Long and I have not been to Shanghai for a long time. I would like to persuade them to quickly accept a few disciples when they come to the south, so as to avoid the danger of losing the Lao Dan and Lu school of Huqin.

Master Hongdou is Able to Do Everything, Civil and Military, Kunqu and Other Arts

No one in the north and south opera circles does not know the names of Master Dongwu (Pu Xiguo), Master Wangsi (Junzhi), and Master Chenshier (Yanheng). However, Chen and Wang specialize in the Tan style. Wang's voice is excellent, and he can often be seen on the Hongdoushe stage. Master Shier does not have a voice, but his humming of the Tan style is very charming. In addition to singing and pronunciation, Chen has also deeply studied the Qin (Huqin), chess, calligraphy, painting, and drums, all following Dai Chunshi, and can imitate him to the point of confusion. Some people say that when he is in financial difficulties, he puts Dai Chunshi's signature on his own works and sells them for a high price. I once preserved several of his fan paintings and letters, and will publish them later so that everyone can appreciate them. The public knows his name in Qin, but in fact, this gentleman is a talented and elegant person. Unfortunately, he and Junzhi both passed away several years ago. Now, only Mr. Xiyuan remains among the three old men, and he also lives on the isolated island. I think those who aspire to study opera arts should quickly seek advice from him and not miss the good opportunity. (47)

### Casual Talk About the Entertainment World

(5) Peking Opera

Among the various arts in the entertainment world, "Peking Opera" can be said to be the one that has lasted for a long time and always has a large number of audiences.

Like literature, it is also divided into "Beijing" and "Shanghai" styles. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. We cannot arbitrarily promote "Beijing Dynasty" or "Shanghai School".

However, according to the older Peking Opera fans, they always feel that the "typical predecessors" are gradually being lost, which is the most poignant page in the "Unofficial History of the Pear Garden"!
