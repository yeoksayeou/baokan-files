Editorial

### The Issue of Japan's Sabotage of China's Coastal Shipping Industry

Excluding the power of European and American countries in China is one of the important tasks for Japan to establish the so-called "New Order in East Asia." Taking the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China as an example, the issue of navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, which European and American countries have been negotiating for a long time, has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Recently, Japan has intensified its use of force to interfere with the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China. In the past few days, nine Portuguese merchant ships in the Zhejiang sea area have been detained by Japanese warships and forced to Shanghai. The British ship "Siggs" was also detained by a Japanese warship on its way from Xiamen to Fuzhou and forced to Taiwan. Japan's interference with the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China did not start recently. However, Japan's recent large-scale detention of British and Portuguese merchant ships clearly indicates that it has even more aggressive intentions for the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China than mere interference.

Since launching its war of aggression against China, Japan has implemented a maritime blockade of China, but it has not cut off transportation between various ports along the Chinese coast. Japan's incomplete blockade is partly due to its fear of provoking interference from third parties. At the same time, it also has economic intentions, namely, to use the shipping between various ports to allow large quantities of Japanese goods to be transshipped to the interior, and many raw materials needed by Japan during the war can also be obtained from the Chinese interior in the same way, so that trade between China and Japan after the war is even more prosperous than before the war. But now things have changed, and interference from third parties is no longer an issue in fact. Japan's blockade of traffic on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers only elicited ineffective protests from European and American countries. Last month, Japan banned European and American merchant ships from sailing between ports north of the Yangtze River in the lower reaches, and European and American countries did not make any practical gestures. Japan anticipates that in order to control China's shipping industry, destroying the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China will not provoke interference from European and American countries. As for the indirect trade that Japan engages in using China's coastal shipping industry, because the Chinese government's control over foreign trade is becoming increasingly strict, it is no longer as easy as it used to be. After Japan's failure in its economic conspiracy, destroying the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China in order to completely blockade China's maritime traffic has become an inevitable act of aggression by Japan.

The reasons Japan recently gave for detaining merchant ships from European and American countries, according to the navy, are: (1) the ships are carrying Chinese guerrillas; (2) they are carrying armaments for the Chinese side; (3) the ships' nationalities are unclear. These three reasons are actually just excuses for deliberately destroying the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China. Taking the first two reasons, Japan detained nine Portuguese merchant ships in the Zhejiang sea area this time, and the detention has been going on for several days. The inspection has been carried out many times. May I ask how many genuine guerrillas has Japan discovered? How many armaments are there? To take a step back, if European and American merchant ships really do carry Chinese guerrillas and armaments as Japan claims, but Japan has not declared war on China, on what article of international law can it prohibit European and American merchant ships from freely carrying passengers and cargo? If the ships' nationalities are unclear, these ships have been sailing along the coast for a long time. Why didn't Japan conduct a detailed investigation with the various European and American diplomatic missions in China in advance? Why did it have to detain them in the ocean? And if the detained European and American merchant ships are genuinely Chinese ships operating under false flags, British warships and Portuguese consuls would not have protested to the Japanese side. The fact that British warships and Portuguese consuls have protested is enough to prove that they are indeed British and Portuguese ships. Japan, however, disregards the protests of British warships and Portuguese consuls. Japan clearly believes that British warships and Portuguese consuls are helping Chinese ships operate under false flags, which is a major insult to Britain and Portugal!

During the current Sino-Japanese War, the damage suffered by European and American personnel from Japan's sabotage of the coastal shipping industry in China is actually very limited. However, from this, we can see Japan's determination to eradicate European and American power in China, and we can see that all of Japan's guarantees are worth absolutely nothing. Yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma gave a speech at the so-called "Asia Development Board," saying that Japan had no intention of interfering with the rights and interests of third parties in the Far East, but only to the extent that it did not endanger Japan's national defense and interests. Then isn't the detention of European and American merchant ships by Japanese warships an interference with the rights and interests of third parties? Could it be that these detained British and Portuguese merchant ships are in any way harmful to Japan's national defense? If European and American countries want to protect what little remains of their rights and interests in China, only practical action is the most effective method. In the past, Britain and the United States tried to protect the free passage of merchant ships with warships in China. Now they should extend this approach, such as the method of dividing defense zones by British and French warships in the Mediterranean in the past, and send warships to protect the free navigation of merchant ships from interference, so as to protect rights and interests. Otherwise, not to mention that navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers will be permanently hopeless, even coastal shipping may be difficult to maintain in the future!

### Guerrilla Warfare in Shanxi: Ammunition is Not a Problem, Output from Mobile Armories is Increasing Daily; Bombs are Available in Endless Supply

A certain place in Shanxi: The mobile armories in Shanxi province use railway steel rails obtained by the Chinese army and guerrilla teams as raw materials to manufacture rifles, and the output is increasing daily. I had the opportunity to carefully examine the products of these armories. The Taiyuan Arsenal in Shanxi province is one of the largest of its kind in China. It was occupied by the Japanese army more than a year ago. The tens of thousands of workers employed in the factory have long been scattered throughout the province. Those who are manufacturing ammunition in remote mountain areas today are the same people. Their products are mostly bombs, rifles, and pistols. If necessary, their manufacturing equipment can be dismantled and transported away by mules within two hours. There are quite a few of these manufacturing sites. Each major political region has a large one, and there are twenty or thirty small ones that are allied with various groups. The numbers of products cannot be announced, of course, but it is said that in a certain political region alone, an average of 10,000 bombs and 200 rifles can be manufactured every day, and can be increased if necessary. Rifles are mostly made from railway steel rails, and bombs are made of iron. Students who have returned from Europe with high metallurgical skills supervise the workers to forge iron in the local method. All manufacturing sites are located in remote areas. My free time is limited, so I cannot personally visit them and see their contents, but I had the good fortune to meet technicians engaged in this work, and I was able to talk to them and carefully examine the samples they produced. It is said that steel rails are soft, which is the main difficulty in manufacturing guns. Later, a method of making hardened steel was obtained, which made things much easier. Now, the main product is bombs, which this province can use endlessly. Even if transportation is cut off for a long period of time, the Chinese army can still rely on these things to carry out the war. An official said that the Japanese army will never be able to cut off our ammunition supply. Every farmer knows how to make gunpowder, because this thing was originally invented in China. Even without detonators, a fuse can be used instead. With these bombs, we can acquire better Japanese weapons, and make the Japanese army unable to use their exquisite weapons any longer. An old-fashioned German hand grenade used in the European War is now a treasure for the Chinese army. At night, when the Japanese army's exquisite weapons lose their effectiveness, the Chinese army often uses these hand grenades to attack the Japanese army. The Chinese army is well-informed, which is due to the nature of the people, so they know in detail every action of the Japanese army, even where the senior officers are located. Moreover, the Chinese army is familiar with the local geography, so even on the darkest nights, they can grope their way to attack the enemy. Once they find their target, they can retreat safely. There are more than a dozen of these attacks every night. The gains from each attack are, of course, very small, but when taken together, the results are quite considerable. When I returned to General Yan Xishan's headquarters, I saw the rifles and pistols made by hand in the Shanxi armories. The rifles were beautifully made. Except for their smooth barrels, they were very similar to those made by machines. There were also two pistol specimens made by the armories of two major counties, one was an 11-millimeter automatic pistol modified from the White Langlin style, made from steel rails obtained from the Tongpu Railway, which was very sharp, and the other was completely handmade, using German Mauser bullets. The construction was very good, and any gun expert would admire it. It was shaped like a Mauser but smaller, and was entirely designed by local workers. It is said that several hundred of these pistols can be made every month, and the number can be increased or decreased as needed. (Special dispatch from the Reuters correspondent, April 7)

### Residents Flee, Never to Return; Japanese Forge Paper Money

A certain place in Shanxi: A reporter met with a county magistrate of a certain county along the railway line in Jin Province in a certain city near the railway line. According to him, "There are 130 villages and towns under my jurisdiction, of which the Japanese only occupy seven. In addition, there are six villages and towns between the Fen River and the Tongpu Railway that have also been invaded by Japanese forces. However, our administrative organs in these areas are still secretly working. The county seat under my jurisdiction has been looted and burned to the ground. In the past, there were 5,000 residents and more than 200 shops, but now it has become a wasteland. Only three households of residents remain. Even the Japanese army does not want to come to this land again. The residents of the county seat have scattered and fled, and their businesses have been completely destroyed. However, if the county government needs funds, it can raise them within a few days. Currently, all expenses of the county government have been greatly reduced, with a total of only 100 yuan per month, which is just enough for food. County government personnel are not paid. Zhao Zhu, an important town on the railway line south of Linfen, has now established a puppet 'local government.' There is only one person working there, an opium addict who used to run a business but is now bankrupt. The Japanese have advertised that if the women of the city's residents return home, they will rebuild their houses for free, but no one has responded. Sometimes the Japanese army threatens to burn the entire city if the residents do not return, but as a result, only a few elderly men reluctantly return, while young women and children still hesitate to come forward."

The county magistrate continued to describe the Japanese efforts to consolidate their financial position, saying that the Japanese army considers it a crime for people in occupied areas to possess more than 30 yuan in Chinese legal tender, and anyone with more than 100 yuan is shot. However, the people still refuse to use Japanese paper money. Not long ago, several Japanese were engaged in currency exchange along the railway line, willing to exchange 90 cents of Chinese legal tender for one yuan of Japanese currency. Their purpose was probably to establish a "black market exchange rate" because the Chinese consider Japanese currency to be worthless, so they wanted to let the Chinese people know that Japanese currency still had some value. Currently, the Japanese have abandoned this method. If the Chinese exchange Japanese currency, they will be given 1.1 or 1.2 yuan of counterfeit Chinese paper money for every yuan of Chinese legal tender. The Japanese are now importing large amounts of counterfeit paper money into Shanxi in an attempt to undermine the credibility of Chinese legal tender, but we will never be deceived by them. As the county magistrate spoke, he handed the reporter a counterfeit five-yuan note from the Shanxi Provincial Bank, instructing him to compare it with the genuine one. This kind of counterfeit money has thicker paper and is easily identifiable, and the color is also lighter than the genuine one. The county magistrate continued, saying that while the currency problem has already caused considerable difficulty, the lack of domestic goods supply is even more serious. The business of governance has virtually come to a complete halt, so unless small-scale industries can be successfully established, the people will be forced to use Japanese currency to buy Japanese goods.

### Wu Jingheng Writes an Article, Questioning Wang Jingwei (3): Accusing the Communist Party of Creating Trouble, Sowing Discord, and Handing Over Chahar with Both Hands—A Memory

(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) (C) Mr. Wang claims that "What I sincerely seek is a century-long plan for East Asia. I have seen through and determined that open warfare between China and Japan will harm both sides, while peace will allow them to coexist." He also says, "It is clear and obvious, right in front of us. Are there any ambitious people in both countries who, intimidated by temporary misfortunes and reputations, hesitate and look around, and dare not make a clear choice?" Mr. Wang actually acts as if he is a person of worth, a revolutionary youth, a party leader, an orator, a poet, and a traitor. He has transformed himself again into an old priest. And your heroic Madam Chen, she has recently been lamenting how the people suffer in the war, forgetting that she helped you fight fiercely in Hankou and Beiping, looking like a pious old woman who has lived for generations. It is a pity that you two are secretly encouraging "comrades" to stir up minor disturbances, preparing to organize a "central government," hoping to steal power and use it as a stepping stone for you to advance towards the enemy. People cannot help but see through your masks and know that you are crying crocodile tears, which is actually laughable. It is better to advise you to take good care of your young head that is quick to draw a knife, and always be honest. (D) What Mr. Wang least believes in is honesty. His ambition is to achieve unparalleled heights. It is almost as if, if there were a God in the universe, he would want to surpass God. In fact, no matter how well he learns Sun Wukong's ability to change, he can never change that tail. People see him as just an animal. What is his tail after all? It is the "immature" green youth, the orator who does not understand logic, the bookworm who searches for phrases and sentences, and the ordinary man who loves a few dirty coins. I used to call him a hypocrite, but I fell for his tricks. Party leader and traitor are just temporary titles he occupies. Eventually, he will be kicked away, picked up by the tail, and transformed again, from the extreme left to the extreme right, from the extreme high to the extreme low, from the extreme fragrant to the extreme smelly. He does not care. He himself thinks that he has "seen through" and changes immediately. He has seen through that the revolution is coming from the left, and feels that he is certainly not a match for Lenin, Trotsky, or the Trinity, or Stalin. He has also seen through the century-long plan for East Asia and believes that at least Hitler, Mussolini, and young soldiers will be under his control. People say that Jingwei has already joined a certain group. He is acting as a high-ranking traitor, which is not as simple as Qin Hui or Li Wanyong. Therefore, the iron statues of Qin Hui and Madam Wang by the West Lake are not enough for them. At least tungsten steel should be prepared for their weight. We do not know what will happen next, so let us see how he transforms again. What I lament now is that since he knows that "advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not cause division," how can others not see this? People can only answer you by saying that advocating war will not cause division. Who is using the War of Resistance to achieve unification? What are you opposing? You are trying to incite your "comrades" to create a small disturbance for the enemy. If you stir up a small disturbance in the country at this time, can you still handle this transformation? What kind of tinplate should we use to prepare for your centenary memorial?

China's unification through the War of Resistance is a new term that everyone readily uses. No one created this term to fight the war. When asked about the content of this term, it means that, except for a very small number of animal-like traitors, all Chinese people are patriots. I will also give an example. The Political Council, which you presided over, is a gathering of representatives from various parties and factions, unified by the War of Resistance. Everyone remembers the weakening of national power due to past divisions, so once united, they will not divide again. Therefore, you can also believe that "advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not cause division." Unification also includes the Communist Party's obedience to the Three Principles of the People and support for the National Government, and they are also fighting the war together. You believe that the Communist Party is inherently disruptive. You also say that the Communist Party can "come to the surface," but until now, we have only seen you openly surrendering, and we have not seen the Communist Party openly causing trouble. The Communist Party can come to the surface, but you have not even come to the surface. You just want to promote yourself and create internal strife, plot to harm the country, provide benefits to the enemy, and satisfy your personal desires. The ancients said, "If a man is clean, he should be promoted. If he is clean together, he should not be dismissed." We only know that they are Chinese people who obey the Three Principles of the People, support the National Government, and fight the war together. That is all. England, which the Communist Party wants to overthrow first, can still cooperate with the Soviet Union because of the democratic bloc. China discriminates against Chinese people who advocate democracy and obey the Three Principles of the People. How can this be? You have promoted democracy all your life, but you have seen through the actions of the anti-democratic bloc and want to jump ship immediately. You mention communism or non-communism, but you just want to say that China supports communism and should be "punished" by aggressive countries that use anti-communism as a pretext. You say, "If the Communist Party's disturbances come to the surface when advocating peace, it would be better than the current situation of manipulating, controlling, and sowing discord." This sentence clearly announces your own plan, which is to hope that the Communist Party does not cause trouble, so you come to do the work of manipulating, controlling, and sowing discord first. If the Communist Party falls into your trap and causes trouble, your opportunity will come. What is it? It is that you can borrow the name of seeking foreign aid to borrow Japanese soldiers to quell internal strife. Isn't this kind of intention Wu Sangui of the Ming Dynasty or Li Wanyong of Korea? You are acting perversely to such an extent. Do you still have any conscience? You have been sitting in the Central Party Headquarters for more than a day. Who does not follow you to "persuade Communist friends with good intentions and wish them to come to the surface naturally and jointly build a country based on the Three Principles of the People?" What are you intending to publicly mention it to the enemy in particular? You advocate a peace agreement that betrays the country, and you also have the ability to make them come to the surface, and everyone loves the country with them. You have no way to make them come to the surface. What kind of logic is this? Well, please, you who are not inherently disruptive, search your conscience and see through less. Honestly be your number one young man who is quick to draw a knife. I have offended you, and I am willing to be punished by you in the future.

Finally, I will also return you "an example." You should remember that when you were the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China, didn't the Japanese warlords demand the removal of Chairman Song Zheyuan of Chahar? You received the demands of the Japanese warlords, and without asking anyone, without asking how, and without asking what mistakes Chairman Song Zheyuan had made, and whether he should be removed or not, you used your sincere diplomacy, responsible spirit, and extraordinary vision and means to quickly issue an order overnight to remove Chairman Song. You bowed to the Japanese warlords, obeyed their orders, and handed over the entire sovereignty of Chahar to the Japanese warlords in less than 24 hours. The Japanese warlords acquired Chahar peacefully without spending a single bullet or shedding a drop of blood. Do you see any difference between this and President Hacha handing over Czechoslovakia last month? Calculating the time, your brilliant and rapid diplomatic means of handing over Chahar were much faster than the handing over of Czechoslovakia. I do not know how many other practical examples there are. I only cite this one example, which is enough to show your high opinion, foresight, and diplomatic genius, and your ability to betray power to the enemy in a responsible and sincere manner and humiliate the country. Mr. Wang, you are so responsible and sincere to the Japanese warlords. How could the Japanese warlords be willing to give you up? Among the 450 million Chinese people, no one else can be found except you. Therefore, they found Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi, but they were not enough. They had to say to you that only you, Mr. Wang, can be their negotiating opponent. This is no wonder they say that because they did not intend to seduce you or harm you intentionally, but to benefit themselves and make it easier for them to destroy China. And you really do not intend to harm Japan, but they see your way of handing over Chahar so quickly, which can not but make their ambition to destroy China more pronounced and their spirit of humiliating China particularly high. Therefore, they gain an inch and want a mile, so that the Japanese warlords are inexplicably happy and remember why, and even disregard their own traditional policies and supreme military strategy.

Until the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, they still thought that the Chinese only respond to force and not gentleness, so they sent troops into the customs, recklessly burned and killed in Tianjin, and occupied Beiping. They still delusionally thought that our National Government was the same as when you were the President of the Executive Yuan in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China. As long as they use force to threaten and entice, they can sign a surrender and easily get North China. Not only that, they also... In their hearts, they sent troops to Shanghai to attack Nanjing until they occupied Guangzhou and Wuhan. Mr. Wang, do you know what this is? I am afraid you still do not understand. This is to wait for you to come out and be the opponent of the National Government. But they have arrived in Wuhan, and you are still unwilling to come out to be their opponent. Do you really want them to fight to Xi'an and Nanning before you are willing to overthrow the National Government and be their opponent? If they arrive in Xi'an and Nanning, they will suffer many casualties and spend a lot of military expenses, and they will spend all of their 600 million war budget for this year. If they cannot capture Xi'an and Nanning at this time, or if they capture them but you still do not come out to overthrow the National Government and be their opponent, then you, Mr. Wang, are really harming them and are really sorry for them. At this time, your good friend, the Japanese military, will definitely question you and ask whether your "establishment of a long-term peace and stability in East Asia for a hundred years" and "another path of common survival and common development" in "an example" are not deceiving people. If you are afraid that you cannot answer by that time, I will help you think that you only need to say, "I am Chinese, and we use deception in war. I am doing this now because you have failed, but this is enough to be 'a long-term peace and stability in East Asia for a hundred years' and 'another path of common survival and common development.'" If you answer him like this, will you not become a famous statesman in history? If this is really the result, then in our future history of the Sino-Japanese War, on the day that the Republic of China gains independence, freedom, territorial sovereignty, and administrative integrity, will your first contribution not be recorded on the first page? What are you afraid of having grievances that cannot be cleared? I think that if you want to serve the country and make a name for yourself, and leave a legacy for future generations, you can only do this. This is the first method that your old comrade has thought of for you. Besides this, there is only a dead end. Please cherish it and do not take the wrong path. If you get to the point where you take a wrong step and regret it for a thousand years, it will be too late to regret. Goodbye. (The End)

### British Reporter Praises the Yunnan-Burma Highway

(London) The Chinese government's procurement committee in London recently ordered various construction materials worth 180,000 pounds from several British firms for the Yunnan-Burma Railway. It is reported that the construction of the railway is currently being carried out actively, and there are still other transactions under negotiation. According to news from Chinese sources in London, the route of the Yunnan-Burma Railway follows the one suggested by British engineers forty years ago. Recently, a reporter from The Times traveled by car on the highway from Lashio to Kunming and published an article detailing his impressions of the excellent achievements of the Chinese engineers. According to the report, the total length of the highway is 124 miles from Lashio to the border and 648 miles from the border to Kunming. The 367-mile section of the highway within China, from Xiaguan to the border, was only started in October 1937. Although the altitude there is between 2,000 and 8,000 feet above sea level, it was completed in 14 months and can be used for lighter vehicles. The section of the highway from Longling to the Salween Valley is the worst, passing through mountains 8,000 feet high, with steep slopes and bends. The outside of the highway is also adjacent to steep mountain walls as deep as 2,000 feet. At present, countless man-hours have been spent on this section of the highway, but landslides often occur due to geological reasons. The suspension bridge across the Salween Valley, which is 280 feet wide, was recently completed and is now being rebuilt to allow heavier vehicles to pass. According to the reporter, if the highway is to support heavy traffic during the rainy season, adequate ditches must be dug on the inside of the road to drain the accumulated water. The reporter praised the achievements of the Chinese engineers, saying that travelers in Yunnan Province have unlimited admiration for the determination and perseverance of the Chinese.

### Roosevelt Warns Totalitarian Countries: If War Breaks Out in Europe, the U.S. Cannot Avoid Being Involved; U.S. Strength Far Greater Than Germany and Italy; British Newspapers Say Don't Easily Believe Panic-Mongering News

(Washington) President Roosevelt met with newspaper reporters today and hinted at the possibility of the United States being drawn into the European war. It is noted that when President Roosevelt left his hometown of Warm Springs to return to the capital, he told his neighbors, "If we do not have a war, I will still return home in the autumn." The Washington Post commented that this was a warning to the totalitarian countries, saying that "any war they start will draw in a country whose strength is greater than that of Germany and Italy." The New York Times' headline stated that President Roosevelt said that the U.S. would be drawn into the whirlpool, which is in line with the idea that we cannot stand aloof from the great war." The New York Forum for Public Opinion also stated that President Roosevelt's words were a warning to the aggressors. President Roosevelt made a clearer statement to reporters today, saying that the Washington Post's commentary was excellent, clear, and honest, and future generations would know the true meaning of what I said. (Associated Press on the 11th)

(London) The Times published a commentary entitled "Disturbed Europe" and the Daily Telegraph also published a commentary entitled "Tensions in Europe", both discussing the alarming events in the current international situation, but saying that the panic-mongering news that accompanies the tense situation has become a new diplomatic technique of the aggressor countries. The Times said that this kind of news should not be believed entirely, but rather considered as a trick of those who are creating and trying to take advantage of this situation. U.S. President Roosevelt's interpretation of an article in the Washington Post is very significant, saying that the intentional threat to Western culture will involve the fate of the United States, which is probably the most direct warning ever heard. The President's Office and the State Department share this view, and most Americans seem to think so as well. (Reuters telegram on the 12th)

(Washington) When President Roosevelt met with newspaper reporters today, the reporters asked him to express his opinion on the international situation. The President immediately replied that the article published by the Washington Post today, which commented on his remarks in Warm Springs, was "clear and honest," and that everyone should read it. According to the newspaper, the President said when he left Warm Springs, "If we do not encounter war before this fall, then I will come back here again." Does this mean that the U.S. will join the war, or does it mean that a war will break out on the other side of the Atlantic? If we think carefully about the President's words, we will know that the word "we" used by the President refers to the countries of Western civilization. Any war that harms Western civilization, regardless of whether our country participates in it or not, will have a vital impact on our country. "At this time, if the countries that believe in freedom can take a firm attitude in time, war can be avoided. The pressure exerted by the Rome-Berlin Axis on other countries will not be relaxed unless it encounters real resistance. Countries can only deal with it with consistent firmness, which can force it to adopt a compromising and sincere attitude. In short, force is the only creed of the dictators, and only by showing stronger force can their barbaric actions be stopped. Under this kind of situation, the United States will naturally become a powerful factor. President Roosevelt has indicated to the Axis countries that our country will not sit idly by and ignore the conspiracies of these countries, and has clearly pointed out that any war that is started by the Axis countries will immediately involve the United States. At the same time, there is another level that needs to be noted, that is, the strength of the United States is much stronger than the combined strength of Germany and Italy. This is a fact, and if it is stated frankly at this time, it will benefit the prevention of war. In short, dealing with the dictators with a tough attitude is the best way to prevent war. Recently, France has strengthened its current policy, and the United Kingdom has also decided on the final "limit of retreat," which are all due to this kind of argument. President Roosevelt wants the United States to intervene at the last minute to prevent war, and his starting point is also the same. " Generally, people are now commenting on President Roosevelt's citation of the Washington Post, saying that since the President fully agrees with the opinions expressed by the newspaper and wants to use this to warn the Rome-Berlin Axis countries, this can be seen. (Havas on the 11th)

### Americans Support Boycott of German Goods

(New York) The Institute of Public Opinion conducted a survey on the issue of boycotting German goods. The question posed was, "Do you support participating in the national boycott of German goods?" The results of the survey have now been revealed. A total of 65 percent supported participation, while 35 percent opposed it. According to reports, this question has been surveyed more than once. When it was conducted in October of last year, only 56 percent supported it. By the time it was surveyed in December of last year, the number of supporters had increased to 61 percent. It can be seen that the number of Americans supporting the boycott of German goods is increasing day by day. In addition, the Institute also surveyed public opinion on the issue of imposing additional tariffs on imports of German goods. As a result, 78 percent supported it. (According to reports, since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the U.S. government has ordered that, starting from the 23rd of this month, an additional tariff of 25 percent be levied on most imports from Germany.) (Havas telegram on the 11th)

### German Newspapers Criticize England

(Berlin) German newspapers are all strongly opposed to England. Political activities here are still affected by the Easter holiday and remain suspended. Currently, the only important cabinet member remaining in Berlin is Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The rumors that troops are moving towards the Polish border have been strongly denied by the authorities. (Reuters telegram on the 11th)

### Remembering Easter: Exchanges Reopen, Market Prices Remain Stable

(London) After the Easter holiday, when European stock exchanges reopened, prices generally saw a sharp decline. This was expected. The Paris exchange saw significant selling, with government bonds falling by one to two pounds. In Amsterdam, Netherlands, major securities fell by as much as fifteen pounds. However, after Prime Minister Colijn's speech was released, confidence was somewhat restored. Although prices on the London Stock Exchange fell, there was no heavy selling pressure. Most British bondholders are unwilling to exacerbate the situation. Due to the shock in Continental Europe, a large number of sales were originally expected, but it is now known that the number is small, which is also encouraging. Although there was a rush to sell major currencies on the London foreign exchange market, the market was not affected and remained relatively stable. However, some people in Amsterdam were bidding for US dollars, causing the price of the Dutch guilder to fall. Later, the Dutch equalization fund sold a large number of US dollars, and the guilder price was maintained. (Reuter, 11th)

### European Situation Slightly Eases, But Countries Still Deploying Defenses: Italy Announces Suspension of Mobilization, Seeming to Reconsider

Malta The tense situation here in the past few days has eased. According to official announcements, the overall situation has returned to normal, and army defenses have also been relaxed. (Reuter, 11th)

(Paris) The entire French fleet has been fully prepared, and troops have been stationed at coastal artillery forts. Many conscripted soldiers have returned to their camps, and many technicians have also been drafted into the army. (Reuter, 11th)

(Paris) The French call-up of reservists of all ranks has become increasingly apparent in recent days. Yesterday, military vehicles frequently passed through the main thoroughfares of the capital, and reservists from various districts in eastern France were also flocking to the capital in response to the call. Therefore, railway transportation is also extremely busy. It is reported that naval bases in French territories in the Mediterranean have also taken measures to call up reservists and strengthen defenses. (Haitong, 12th)

(London) The Daily Telegraph reports that a large number of Spanish troops are currently concentrated in Santander and other points near the French border. The French authorities are closely watching this situation. According to news from Spain in recent days, Spain is ostensibly demobilizing its troops under the guise of ending internal strife, but in reality, it is concentrating troops at key points. (Reuter, 12th)

Gibraltar The military authorities here are currently taking precautionary measures on the border of the territory every evening, prohibiting anyone from entering the port from the Spanish city of La Línea. (Havas, 11th)

(Paris) According to reports from Gibraltar, the British have strengthened the garrison in Gibraltar, and fully armed patrols are patrolling the border between Gibraltar and Spain. (Haitong, 12th)

The Hague The semi-official Dutch news agency recently issued a message stating that the Dutch government has ordered a small number of reservists to prepare for enlistment so that they can immediately enlist when the development of the situation necessitates mobilization. (Havas, 12th)

Amsterdam The extraordinary military measures taken in the entire coastal area of the Netherlands have made a very deep impression here. Since the Easter holidays, machine guns and cannons have been set up at every specified distance along the entire coastline of the Netherlands to prevent any attempts to land in the Netherlands. Scheveningen, a famous seaside resort, is also guarded by naval authorities, with guns and cannons everywhere, and strict security. (Haitong, 12th)

Brussels According to authoritative sources, the Belgian government does not intend to take any precautionary military measures, as all necessary steps have already been arranged. There are no changes at present. Although the army is being mobilized, this is only part of a spring exercise. (Haitong, 12th)

Warsaw The authorities today called up six classes of reservists from 1912 to 1917. (Reuter, 11th)

Capital of Yugoslavia Although Yugoslavia's attitude towards Italy's occupation of Albania has not been formally announced, it has taken certain military precautions. Several classes of reservists have been called up, mostly in areas adjacent to the Yugoslav-Albanian border. At the same time, people here welcome Archbishop Gaffey, the representative of the Croatian national leader Maček, as his arrival may indicate that the long-standing issue of Croatian autonomy will reach a compromise between the two sides. (Reuter, 12th)

Cairo Since yesterday, military movements have been busy on Egypt's western border. Heavy troops are stationed along the border with Libya, and British troops stationed along the Suez Canal have been ordered to move westward. This morning, British troops from Palestine have arrived to fill the defenses. (Haitong, 12th)

Jerusalem Two British infantry battalions, a mechanized cavalry regiment, a transportation company, and a horse-drawn artillery unit departed from Palestine yesterday and headed for Egypt. (Haitong, 12th)

Aden The countries of the Arabian Peninsula are sparing no effort in strengthening their military. The Kingdom of Yemen is recruiting volunteers to train troops, and the government has issued a notice to the people to participate in national defense and jointly resist foreign aggression. The Kingdom of Nejd has also hired former Turkish officers to train its troops. (Havas, 12th)

(Rome) The official gazette recently published a statement saying, "The number of soldiers in our country has reached its highest level. In addition to recruits from the 1917 and 1918 classes, and a portion of recruits from the 1919 class who are currently serving, reservists from the 1901 and 1912 classes, and a portion of technicians of all classes, have also been called up. Unless there are special circumstances in the future, it is not intended to call up other classes of reservists to serve." (Havas, 11th)

(Rome) After the government actively prepared for military affairs, the whole country was filled with a wartime atmosphere. People generally said that the situation would develop extremely seriously, and private conversations were mostly about war. Reservists between the ages of 25 and 40 were being called up one after another. They were visible everywhere on the streets and in vehicles. The number of soldiers in the army has reached more than one million. The authorities also plan to hold large-scale air defense exercises within a few months. The intensity of the work has made a deep impression on the public. Although the Italian troops who invaded Albania did not encounter strong resistance, large numbers of reinforcements continued to be sent to the country in recent days. (Havas, 11th)

Capital of Albania Italian army units were sent by plane to the two central locations of Korçë and Krujë, and immediately occupied them. In addition, the town of Bilisht, located at the border between Albania and Greece, has also been occupied by Italian troops. (Havas, 11th)

### Britain Still Intends to Get to the Root of the Problem, Promoting a Balkan Security Pact, and There Are Also Proposals for Italy to Join; Denies Mussolini Sent a Letter to Chamberlain

(London) Several members of the cabinet, especially Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon and Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, have a plan, the main idea of which is that Britain invites Italy to jointly guarantee the status quo of the Balkan Peninsula, in exchange for the country withdrawing its troops from Spain. They also hope to establish a Mediterranean pact, but the dispute between Italy and France must be resolved first. Otherwise, this pact can only be limited to the eastern Mediterranean. The details of the above plan are still unknown. The British government will definitely do its best to make it successful. Its intention is, even if it does not dismantle the Rome-Berlin Axis, at least to prevent Italy from blindly following Germany's lead. In addition, Bulgarian Minister to Britain Momtchiloff visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to inform him that Bulgaria does not intend to destroy the existing agreements between Bulgaria and other Balkan countries, and Bulgaria is also opposed to any interference from countries outside the Balkan Peninsula. If so, maintaining the status quo of the Balkan Peninsula will be facilitated. This is also one of the reasons why the European situation is easing. (Havas, 11th)

(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini sent a letter to Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday, explaining the country's actions in Albania, saying that this move does not contradict the Anglo-Italian Agreement, and that the country's ambition is for peace. Once General Franco triumphantly enters Madrid on May 2, the remaining 25,000 soldiers will withdraw from Spain. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed this matter at 3:00 this afternoon. Those present included Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Home Secretary Hoare, Lord Chancellor Inskip, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Morrison, and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan. It is heard that because Italy has promised to respect the territorial integrity of Greece and has now provided guarantees on the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers, it has been decided that it is not necessary to abolish the Anglo-Italian Agreement, so that the door to negotiations will not be closed as a result. (Havas, 11th)

(London) The British Prime Minister's residence and the Foreign Office today firmly denied the rumor that Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had private contacts. (Reuter, 12th)

(London) The Foreign Office issued a communiqué today denying that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had sent any letter to Prime Minister Chamberlain. Political figures commented on the communiqué, saying that the cabinet did indeed discuss this letter during the small group meeting yesterday, and even some cabinet members therefore advocated caution. All the newspapers in the country also firmly believed that this was the case, and the Foreign Office's denial was probably intended to indicate that the government did not want to use this document as a basis for discussion. Therefore, the denial is only important in domestic politics. (Havas, 12th)

(Paris) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's letter to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, stating that the country has no intention of changing the status quo in the Mediterranean, has been commented on by diplomatic figures here. Whether this statement is sincere depends on whether the country fulfills the Anglo-Italian Agreement and withdraws all its troops from Spain. Regarding this matter, the British government has repeatedly asked the Italian government to provide formal guarantees, but the Italian authorities have only made verbal guarantees. Their intention is not sincere, but only to ease any actions that Britain may take in the Mediterranean. When war breaks out in Europe, Italy may even use its troops stationed in Spain to attack the British port of Gibraltar, and then attack the international neutral port of Tangier. If so, it would seriously affect the communication lines between these ports and the British Empire, which Britain will never passively wait for, but must meet with a counterattack. (Havas, 12th)

### The Greek Question

Athens The Italian Minister to Greece delivered a note to the Greek government today, stating that "Italy sincerely hopes to establish close and friendly relations with Greece." Italy has no intention of attacking Greece, and hopes that Greece will not doubt this sincerity. It should be known that the various rumors arising from the Albanian incident were spread by "Italy's enemies." In short, the Italian government is willing to guarantee the integrity of Greece's territory and islands. (Associated Press, 12th)

(Rome) The Italian government solemnly provided Greece with a guarantee on the 10th of this month, stating that it would respect the territorial integrity of the country. Greek Minister to Italy Metaxas expressed his gratitude to the Italian government. (Havas, 12th)

(London) When the House of Commons reconvenes on the 13th of this month, Prime Minister Chamberlain is expected to issue a statement saying that Britain will regard any threat to Greece as an unfriendly act. However, it is not yet known whether the same statement will be issued to Turkey to provide guarantees. It is also said that the guarantees that the British government intends to provide to Greece are unilateral in nature and do not constitute a mutual assistance agreement, as Britain and Poland did previously. It is also reported that the Spanish parliament established a friendly treaty with Germany and Italy on the 23rd or 24th of last month, containing a non-aggression clause, but without special military mutual assistance clauses. (Havas, 11th)

(London) Responsible figures here recently stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to announce in the House of Commons tomorrow that guarantees will be given to Greece. The motive for this move is, on the one hand, to establish a collective security system to resist future aggression, and on the other hand, to maintain Britain's strategic interests. If something happens in the future, Greece becoming one of Britain's front lines is no different from Belgium, the Rhineland in France, and Portugal, Egypt, and Iraq becoming Britain's front lines. If this is the case, then Italy's occupation of Albania, regardless of the reason, is enough to threaten Britain, which is undeniable. Therefore, in order to maintain its operational capabilities in the eastern Mediterranean, the British Navy cannot and should not ignore this threat. As far as the current situation is concerned, the number of bases that the British Navy can use in the eastern Mediterranean is very small. It is allowed that between the British island of Malta and the Suez Canal, there is only the port of Alexandria that can accommodate large warships. Other ports, such as Port Said in Egypt, Haifa in Palestine, and Cyprus, can only accommodate a small number of warships. Therefore, if Greek ports can be used by the British fleet in wartime, it will be of great benefit. Although the movement of British warships to these ports is not actually restricted, if Britain and Greece can establish a mutual assistance agreement so that Britain can use these strategic locations according to the treaty, it would be a wise move. This is why Britain is eager to give guarantees to Greece first. (Havas, 12th)

(Rome) Political figures here recently commented on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula, stating that although Italy has given guarantees to Greece, declaring that it will not invade, it must be in exchange for the country not participating in the "encirclement" policy promoted by Britain. Therefore, if the mutual guarantees between Britain and Poland are extended to the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, then Italy, in addition to occupying Albania, should further expand its influence into the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea basin. Italy's position is such that the newspapers have revealed it to warn Greece, Turkey, Romania, and even Yugoslavia not to join the collective security organization advocated by Britain, which would bring disaster upon themselves. The newspapers here said that if Turkey and Greece provide ports for foreign fleets to use, Italy will never tolerate it. Among them, the "Padano Post" also hopes that Romania, Turkey, and Greece will follow the example of Yugoslavia and treat Italy with understanding. Otherwise, "Albania has become a vassal of Italy, and has become Italy's strategic base in the Adriatic Sea, and will become Italy's bridge to extend its influence into the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea."

### Poland and Britain Help Each Other: Germany Raises Objections, Believes Military Measures Are Unfriendly: Polish Ambassador to Germany Returns Home for Instructions

Warsaw Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski recently returned here from Berlin after holding talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to report on the situation. The Polish government is quite concerned about the situation, and a part of the reservists has been called up. The semi-official Iskra news agency recently issued a statement with the title "We should unite and maintain a strong force so that we can be prepared for any eventuality." Its content is to appeal to the people to prepare to make sacrifices. This article should be based on official authorization. (Havas, 11th)

Warsaw Informed political figures here recently stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop explained Germany's views on the mutual assistance agreement agreed upon by Britain and Poland when he met with Polish Ambassador Lipski on the 7th of this month. According to German figures here, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop told Ambassador Lipski that Britain's guarantee to Poland contradicts the spirit of the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Once the verbal agreement agreed upon by Britain and Poland becomes a written agreement, the German government will have to reconsider the entire situation. As for the military measures taken by the Polish government, Germany considers them to be "unfriendly" actions. (Havas, 12th)

(Berlin) Polish Ambassador Lipski, who recently returned home, is reportedly that the German government did not put forward concrete suggestions for the outstanding issues between Germany and Poland. Only the "People's Observer" recently published an article explaining Germany's various requirements to Poland. Outsiders were unaware and thought that the German government had made various requests to Ambassador Lipski. In fact, the various opinions mentioned in the newspaper had already been explained to the Warsaw government by German Ambassador to Poland Moltke two weeks ago. Ambassador Lipski has not returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since he had a meeting with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the 7th of this month to discuss Poland's military measures (it is rumored that the conversation that day was quite tense). Afterwards, he returned home to report on his duties, and has remained there until now. It is estimated that Lipski can return here tomorrow. (Havas, 12th)

### French Government Decides: Diplomatic and Military Declarations to be Issued Today

(Paris) The Council of Ministers met at 10:00 this morning, presided over by President Lebrun, and approved the draft declaration, which will be issued by Prime Minister Daladier in the name of the French government tomorrow, to explain France's attitude towards the European situation. At the meeting, Prime Minister Daladier reported on the general situation and proposed various necessary military measures to adapt to international events, which were immediately approved by the Council of Ministers. It was decided that Foreign Minister Bonnet would report on France's recent diplomatic activities, emphasizing the necessity of France's cooperation with Britain in diplomacy, and explaining the main principles on which France's current attitude is based. Before attending the Council of Ministers meeting, Foreign Minister Bonnet met with British Ambassador Sir Phipps. (Havas, 12th)

(Paris) Before the cabinet meeting this afternoon, Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet both consulted with General Pétain, the French Ambassador to Spain, who had just returned from Burgos. According to political sources, what General Pétain wanted to discuss included the following matters: (1) Italy's failure to withdraw its troops in Spain, (2) Spain's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact, and (3) the slow pace of the Spanish government's repatriation of refugees in France. At the same time, it is heard that negotiations between France and the Spanish government have proven to be not easy, as the Spanish government is currently taking a strict approach to the refugee issue, and will not allow refugees in France to return to the country until the French side fulfills the Bérat Agreement, which stipulates the return of jewels and arms. Regarding this issue, many events must go through legal procedures, so it is considered quite difficult. It is heard that the Spanish army is currently building fortifications on the border of French Morocco, and is quite busy. However, this matter has not caused much concern among the French, because Italy's actions in Albania have made Muslims inclined to France even more than before. (Reuter, 11th)

(Paris) The cabinet held a cabinet meeting at 4:00 this afternoon to discuss the situation, which lasted until 6:30. According to responsible sources, Foreign Minister Bonnet gave a detailed report on the current diplomatic situation, and the cabinet immediately approved the various measures decided by the Standing Committee on National Defense yesterday, and formulated other measures, which will be submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval tomorrow, so as to strengthen national defense and prepare for any eventuality. In addition, Prime Minister Daladier met with Ambassador to Spain General Pétain before the cabinet meeting, and held talks with Foreign Minister Bonnet and Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac after the meeting. President Lebrun met with Chief of General Staff General Gamelin. (Havas, 11th)

Algiers The Governor-General today received a protest from the Muslims in Algiers against Italy's actions in Albania, with a declaration of allegiance to France and resistance to aggression to defend the motherland. Mass rallies were held in all major centers today. (Reuter, 11th)

### American Sympathy for China

(Washington) Yesterday, during the Foreign Affairs Committee's discussion on revising the Neutrality Act, Mr. Maas, an important figure in the House Naval Affairs Committee, suggested: "The United States should protect its interests in all countries, and its interests in China must also be protected. I absolutely sympathize with China. The United States does not invoke the Neutrality Act in the Sino-Japanese war, which shows American aid to China. Furthermore, I believe Guam should be fortified immediately. Once fortified, Japan would never dare to venture past the island. American loans to China have already provoked fierce opposition from Japan. I believe the United States should facilitate all goods needed by China, regardless of how vehemently the aggressors oppose it. The United States should assist China in continuing its resistance." (American Associated Press dispatch, 12th)

(New York) Mr. Frederick, chairman of the United China Relief, received a letter from Madame Chiang Kai-shek of China yesterday, expressing her gratitude. The contents were recently published by Mr. Frederick, who also stated, "An American donation of one US dollar per month can save a life in China." This shows that although the amount may be small, the effect is very significant. The committee has now established numerous branches, hoping to raise substantial funds to aid one million Chinese refugees. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### British Ambassador to Spain Presents Credentials

Burgos. British Ambassador Sir Peterson presented his credentials to General Franco, head of the National Army government, in Cabitanieli today. Mr. Franco stated in his address that Spain wishes to establish friendly relations with all countries like Britain. Historically, Britain and Spain have had close ties due to geographical reasons. As Spain undertakes a new plan, it is certain that its great sacrifices will be recognized and will gain the most sincere sympathy and friendship. In this spirit, he and the Spanish government will engage in the most sincere cooperation. Mr. Peterson, in his reply, spoke of Britain's sympathy for Spain and stated that he would do his best to maintain and promote British-Spanish relations. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Japan Forcibly Sends Civil Officials to China to Intensify Aggression

(Tokyo) Reports state that the Japanese government will soon begin forcibly sending civil officials to serve in China and Mongolia "to enhance and accelerate continental development." When officials from various administrative provinces are dispatched to branches of the "Asia Development Board" and other organizations on the mainland, those dispatched will not be allowed to request exemption based on family circumstances unless they have sufficient and legitimate reasons. Upon completion of the two-year service period, the government guarantees their return to Japan and reinstatement in their original positions without loss of qualifications or other benefits.

### Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Launches Major Counteroffensive; Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat in Xia County; South of Jie County, Duntai Ridge Recovered

(Chongqing) Battle reports from Shanxi Province indicate that the Chinese army in southern Shanxi launched a general offensive against Japanese positions on the morning of the 10th. Another report claims the Chinese army has entered Kaifeng, with street fighting underway. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

(Chongqing) According to military reports from the Chinese side in Shanxi Province, it has been confirmed that the Chinese army has launched a general offensive on all fronts in southern Shanxi. When the Chinese military spokesperson received journalists today, he declined to disclose details of the Chinese army's offensive, citing military secrecy. However, according to the aforementioned military reports, the Chinese army began its offensive at dawn on April 10th. Simultaneously, reports from the north state that the Chinese army in Henan Province also launched an offensive on Kaifeng on the evening of the 10th, breaking through the outer city and entering the city through the south gate the following day. Street fighting is currently taking place inside Kaifeng. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

(Chongqing) According to reports from Shanxi Province, after the Japanese army's attempt to dislodge the Chinese army defending Zhongtiao Mountain failed, they retreated north towards the Tongpu Railway. The Chinese army then launched a general counteroffensive against the Japanese positions between Zhongtiao Mountain and the Tongpu Railway. Chinese daredevil troops charged the south gate of Xia County but withdrew after fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese defenders in the city. Frontline reports state that the Chinese army is still attacking the city walls. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Yuanqu. The Chinese army on all fronts in southern Shanxi launched a major counteroffensive against the Japanese army in the Zhongtiao Mountain area on the 10th. The Chinese air force also dispatched aircraft to coordinate the battle. The received battle situation is summarized as follows: (1) The Chinese army attacking Xia County engaged in several rounds of hand-to-hand combat, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers are still resisting stubbornly from fortified positions, and fighting is ongoing. (2) The Japanese troops in Zhangdian, Houwang, Congshan Village, and Duancun are all under siege by the Chinese army. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. (3) The Chinese army attacking Ershili Ridge (south of Jie County) has captured Duntai Ridge (north of Xie County). The Japanese army has gradually sent reinforcements from Jie County to counterattack the Chinese army, but the Chinese army still holds the advantage. (Dispatch, 11th)

(Beiping) The Japanese army spokesperson stated at a press conference at 6:00 PM yesterday that the Chinese army in southern Shanxi launched a major counteroffensive from the 9th of this month, attacking Yongcheng, Anyi, and Xia County in several directions. The spokesperson claimed that the Japanese army had repelled the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army's losses listed by the spokesperson were extremely small, possibly due to the Chinese army's night attacks. The Japanese side now feels that a major battle will soon occur in the southeastern part of Shanxi Province because Wei Lihuang's troops have already crossed the Yellow River and are advancing. The Japanese side anticipates that Wei Lihuang's troops appear to be attempting to cut off the Pu Railway line south of Taiyuan, isolating the Japanese army in Taiyuan. The Chinese troops who crossed the river this time (2) are from the Sichuan army. The aforementioned Sichuan army crossed the Yellow River from the west of the Tongpu Railway, and a portion of the Sichuan troops has joined the front lines and begun fighting, as evidenced by the battles in Yongcheng, Anyi, and Xia County. The Japanese side believes that the quality of the Chinese troops who crossed the river this time is not sufficient. The Japanese side also stated that in mid-March, before the Chinese army's counteroffensive, the Japanese army engaged in 338 battles with 100,000 Chinese troops in Shanxi Province. (Associated Press dispatch, 12th)

Xingji. Starting from the 6th, the Japanese once again attempted to invade northwestern Shanxi, one route advancing from Qingshuihe towards Pianguan, another from Shenchi attacking Wuzhai, and a third from Jingle invading Kelan. On the morning of the 7th, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers from Qingshuihe advanced south, with one group engaging the Chinese army in a fierce three-hour battle at Dayuyaozi, and another group being stopped by the Chinese army at Hongmenkou, Shenchi. On the 9th, the Japanese increased their forces with more than 30 vehicles and 500-600 soldiers. At 9:00 PM, one unit occupied Bingcun, and on the 10th, they reached Laoniu at noon. Another group advanced from Yijing via Liangchi Village, attacking Sancha. Simultaneously, a Japanese aircraft flew over Wuzhai and dropped several bombs. At 4:00 PM, more than 200 Japanese cavalry invaded Wuzhai County. The Japanese troops in Jingle, with more than 400 infantry and artillery, advanced along the Jingle-Kelan road towards Ximabang at 4:00 AM on the 8th. A Chinese detachment engaged them in Fucun, and after a fierce battle for half a day, the Japanese army collapsed and retreated. The Chinese army in Xihe is currently in pursuit. (Dispatch, 12th)

Yuanqu. In the Pingyao-Qixian area, more than 6,000 Japanese soldiers, starting on the morning of the 11th, advanced towards Zihongkou from Yukou, Zihongkou, Dongnanbeijian, Dongpo and Xipo (all southwest of Zihongkou), attempting to outflank the position. The commander of the Japanese Bonan Division is in command, and fierce fighting is currently underway. (Dispatch, 12th)

### Six Members of the North China Puppet Pacification Committee Killed

(Beiping) During a meeting held by the "Beiping Pacification Committee" affiliated with the "Provisional Government of North China" on Easter Sunday in Kaifeng, the capital of Henan Province, unidentified heroes suddenly attacked and killed all six "committee members" in attendance. One "committee member" was spared because he did not attend the meeting. Those identified among the killed "committee members" include General Hu Yun (transliteration), "Chairman of the Committee," and Fu Qunying (transliteration), a former senior general of the "Manchu Army." This "Pacification Committee" was only established at the beginning of this year, and its purpose was to persuade Chinese soldiers to join the new Chinese organizations. According to Japanese sources in Beiping, the "murderers" in this assassination must have been Chinese who infiltrated the Japanese army in Kaifeng, but as of late last night, the investigation had not yielded any clues. (Haitong Telegraph dispatch, 12th)

### Japanese Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombing Missions, U.S. Lodges Protest

### Japanese Army in North China Oppresses Farmers, Imposing Exactions and Taxes; Each Household Required to Provide One Railroad Tie; Villages Near Railroads Subjected to Burning

The Continental Daily reported yesterday (10th) information obtained by foreigners observing in the vicinity of Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai: The Japanese military and semi-military authorities in North China have begun a widespread program of building roads and railways. Consequently, the Japanese army has altered its attitude toward Chinese farmers in the region and is now apparently attempting to win their sympathy. The Japanese army authorities have ordered soldiers to cease their previous brutal treatment of civilians. Thus, incidents of killing, assault, and rape have significantly decreased. The Japanese army is also attempting to gain the goodwill of the Chinese by claiming to protect them from rampant rural bandits. However, the situation of Chinese farmers remains dire, as they are still forced to endure exactions and taxes, adding to their already heavy burden of war. A prominent example of these exactions is the Japanese army's requirement that each household provide one railroad tie for the construction of new railways. Even foreign churches are subject to similar "taxes." Under these circumstances, foreign churches find it advisable to "cooperate" with the Japanese army. As a result, railway stations along the lines are filled with railroad ties, and the trees in the countryside are almost completely depleted. Farmers who still have trees after delivering railroad ties cut them down for firewood, fearing that the Japanese army will forcibly seize them. Although railway operations continue on schedule, they require special security due to the activities of guerrillas. The railway lines are heavily guarded, and bunkers made of earth and sandbags have been built at each station and bridge. A railway branch line has even more solid fortifications, with trenches every 200 yards. Jinan itself is a major fortress, surrounded by three layers of barbed wire and a military road built specifically for rapidly transporting troops to any attacked location. The construction of these fortifications is proceeding at full speed. Jinan is clearly becoming one of the most important bases for the Japanese army in the region. Farmers in the vicinity of Jinan can profit from engaging in construction work, but those living near the railways are less fortunate, as the Japanese army retaliates against them for guerrilla attacks. Villages near railways attacked by guerrillas are burned down. The Japanese army has also published notices in local newspapers stating that they will not only burn down entire villages but also kill all men between the ages of ten and forty.

### Conditions After the Fall of Wuhan: A Traveler's Account

Guilin Correspondence: Recently, a friend who had traveled from Wuhan through guerrilla areas arrived here. He claims to have left the French Concession in Hankou on March 7, with a group of five people. It took them a total of fifteen days to travel the route. He reported on many aspects of the situation after the fall of Wuhan. A summary is recorded below:

Japanese Construction Work: The enemy invaded Wuhan on December 26 at dawn. On the morning of December 26, the compatriots of Wuhan did not expect that the enemy would quickly attack Wuhan. It was only on the morning of the 26th that the distant sound of gunfire was heard from the river. Fifty or sixty enemy warships sailed up the Yangtze River from the lower reaches. Small motorboats were in front of the warships, and a large number of fighter planes flew low overhead, strafing to protect the warships' advance. Japanese officers and soldiers stood proudly on the bows of the ships, all wearing yellow uniforms. They landed ashore in the afternoon.

Our demolition work was not done well enough. The enemy quickly restored the radio station and hydroelectric power plant. The fortifications we had previously built along the river were used by the enemy, who added very thick steel plates to them, making them very strong, to guard against our future counterattacks.

Occupation Under Iron Heel: Regarding the situation in Wuhan, the enemy designated Districts 1, 2, and 3 of Hankou as commercial areas and the model area as a military area. Only Japanese were allowed to live in these three districts. The area along Minsheng Road was designated as a Sino-Japanese district, where Chinese could reside. The Japanese Concession was completely burned down for fear of guerrilla hiding. They made use of the old shops, such as those along Zhongshan Road. Whatever business they did before, they are still operated by the Japanese now.

The cost of living in Wuhan is extremely high. Rice in the concession sells for 20 yuan per dan, coal for 16 yuan per dan, and two small radishes cost one yuan. Other daily necessities are even more expensive. One yuan and two jiao of Chinese currency can be exchanged for one yuan of Japanese military scrip. It goes without saying that Japanese goods sell well in Wuhan. Japanese canned goods are very cheap; one yuan can buy five cans. Apples and the like can be bought for ten for one yuan. Items such as silk, printed cloth, medicines, and clocks are scattered in various shops.

French Concession Has Capitulated: When the Japanese army first entered Wuhan, the attitude of the French Concession authorities was quite strong. Later, the Japanese army blockaded the French Concession, and the French Concession authorities had to make concessions step by step. Now, Japanese military police arrest pedestrians in the concession at any time. Annamite soldiers guard the gates of the French Concession, not allowing any food to be transported into the concession. If pedestrians are found carrying food into the concession, they are forced to kneel on the ground with the food on their heads, unable to get up for the whole day.

Because the concession was blockaded, the more than 100,000 residents in the concession found it difficult to live and faced immense hardship. Everyone had to move out, but in December, the Japanese authorities stipulated that each person had to purchase a "Residence Permit" for three to five yuan in Japanese currency before returning to their original residence. Pedestrians must sincerely and respectfully bow 90 degrees to Japanese soldiers each time they encountered them on the road, otherwise they would be whipped. Even if their bowing was slightly unsatisfactory, they would not escape a beating. Once, a pedestrian with a shaved head passed in front of Japanese soldiers, who arbitrarily used their bayonets to mock and make fun of his head.

The People Continue to Resist: Hankou's Telegraph Bureau has now become the enemy's military police detective agency, which are everywhere. Every hotel, every alleyway is occupied by Japanese plainclothes detectives. Most hateful are those who are now working for the enemy as intelligence agents, including some who participated in the national salvation work in Wuhan in the past. They are constantly helping the enemy to spy, so that some of the comrades who remain in Wuhan are constantly being monitored by them. One slip and they will soon be arrested.

Our secret work in Wuhan is also being done quite well. Leaflets and slogans on the walls can often be found on the streets, such as "Reject the puppet organization, support Chairman Chiang to resist until the end." These slogans were found on the streets and walls on the morning of the day the puppet maintenance society was established. Although the Japanese authorities and their running dogs smeared them, they reappear immediately after it rains and are indelible traces. (To be continued)

Sexual Hygiene

### A Vibrant and Happy Life is Based on the Health of Both Sexes

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School

Modern couples exist in endless mutual dependence, and their mutual relationship is incomparable to the sexual lives of primitive people. The sexual lives of modern people are based entirely on mutual love and the control of etiquette. All brutality, jealousy, filth, terror, and obscenity, all improper actions arising from the material aspects of sexual desire, can be completely eliminated by the noble form of married life. A vibrant and happy life depends on the harmonious union of both sexes and their mutual improvement and promotion. If all the beautiful potential contained in the harmonious fusion of love life can be fully understood, then no one will want to escape into the asceticism of celibacy! It is a pity that the world still ignores this point, cannot fully exert the effect of the harmony of both sexes, and at the same time cannot strictly abide by the monogamous system for sexual health, resulting in damage and weakening, which affects love. It is really difficult to estimate.

Since the relationship between love and sexual health is as described above, then what methods can be used to make this function fully healthy and happy? In a word, one must cherish chastity before marriage and refrain from debauchery and self-gratification. It must be known that what distinguishes our sexual life from that of primitive people is entirely due to the advocacy of the concept of chastity. Without chastity, everyone can marry anyone, and debauchery and filth cannot be curbed. Therefore, those who are debauched before marriage are prone to causing diseases, and the brain nerves are also extremely weakened. Spinal nerves also show pathological changes. Thereafter, symptoms such as forgetfulness, insomnia, headache, dizziness, mental fatigue, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, and back pain will also erupt.

In addition, early marriage and polygamy are also important reasons for the demise of people willing to sacrifice themselves for the country. Therefore, those who are good at hygiene must value their semen and not dare to indulge in sexual desire and cause damage. Every drop of semen and blood is an important raw material for the love between husband and wife. Therefore, those who have the above-mentioned problems should quickly start with increasing essence and nourishing blood, taking aphrodisiac pills containing endocrine agents. This is not only to supplement the weakness of essence and blood caused by indulgence in sexual desire but also to promote health. From this perspective, after administering the male "Butikon" orally, the function of the testicles to produce sperm cells becomes active, and new essence and blood can be produced continuously. No matter which patient it is, they can show amazing and outstanding effects within 24 hours of being treated with "Butikon," giving their wives unparalleled comfort. At this time, the wife's heartfelt joy is difficult to describe. There are many disharmonious couples in the world. Taking "Butikon" has the effect of regulating menstruation and producing seeds. From then on, a vibrant and happy life begins.

### The Most Advanced Treatment for Lung Disease

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Why is lung disease difficult to treat? Because the tubercle bacillus is covered with wax, which is acid-resistant. Therefore, any oral medication cannot remove its wax, but only has the effect of improving nutrition, so its effectiveness is uncertain. Since Dr. Tume of Germany used the latest theory to formulate "Bofei Nar" from various mineral and plant ingredients, there has been considerable progress in the treatment of lung disease. The special effect of this agent is to enhance resistance to remove the armed state—wax—of tubercle bacillus. Therefore, the extremely violent tubercle bacillus has no place to stand and is completely eliminated. Therefore, no matter how difficult to treat lung disease is, taking "Bofei Nar" will completely cure it. It also has good effects on children's whooping cough, senile asthma, and all influenza, chronic cough, and excessive phlegm.

### Treating Spermatorrhea Must Pay Attention to Hygiene

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Among the symptoms of neurasthenia, there is a condition called spermatorrhea, which affects a very large number of people, especially young people who have just entered adulthood. It is almost unavoidable. Those with severe symptoms often have spontaneous emissions, so that a slight stimulation can also cause semen to flow out. This is known as "sliding emission," which is a particularly serious situation.

Regarding the treatment of spermatorrhea, choosing effective drugs to consolidate the seminal gate is essential, but if one does not pay attention to hygiene or engages in self-gratification, taking large amounts of medicine will still be ineffective. Therefore, at this time, patients should cleanse their hearts and reduce desires, reject lustful thoughts, read noble books, engage in exercise, and abstain from smoking and alcohol. Special attention must be paid to urination before going to bed, because spermatorrhea is a symptom of neurasthenia, so the treatment of neurasthenia is absolutely necessary. Take the male "Butikon," an animal testicle sperm extract, three times a day, three tablets each time, and also take three "Nair Spermatorrhea Tablets" before going to bed. Not only can spermatorrhea be completely cured, but also the underdevelopment, premature aging, back pain, loss of appetite, and other symptoms caused by spermatorrhea can be cured one by one in a short period of time.

Modern medicine

### Chemical Therapy and the Evaluation of Treating Gonorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Chemical therapy has indeed made considerable contributions to the treatment of gonorrhea, but it is not absolutely effective. This is because such therapies can hardly encompass and cure the ever-changing nature of gonorrhea. For example, the chemical therapies currently popular on the market are suitable for acute gonorrhea in some cases and chronic gonorrhea in others. The quest for a comprehensive treatment has yet to be realized. This is because it is beyond the power of medicine to achieve. Regarding this reason, medical experts in Europe and the United States have already made thorough discussions, and there is no need for further elaboration.

What is now attracting the attention of the general public is non-specific therapy. The invention of this therapy has a distinctly superior point compared to general chemical therapy. That is, non-specific therapy can increase the function of white blood cells and bacteria, so it can surpass general chemical therapy as a fundamental treatment for gonorrhea.

Dr. Peter, a German master of venereology, is a giant in the field of gonorrhea studies. He has also conducted more than thirty years of research on the invention of gonorrhea drugs. Based on non-specific therapy, he conducted further research, and the results were greatly rewarding. The doctor used a special protein body mixed with yellow pigment to produce it. After animal experiments, it was clinically tested by famous doctors from various countries. After continuous improvement, the result was the invention of the special gonorrhea drug "Krellinnon," which is praised by experts from all over the world. Clinical practitioners in various countries have praised this agent extensively.

Based on my experience, I felt particularly troubled by gonorrhea before the invention of "Krellinnon." However, since the invention of "Krellinnon," I have found it much more convenient. All cases of chronic prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., that had not been cured by chemical therapy were completely cured after switching to "Krellinnon." In addition, using "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" to wash the urethra, and for women with gonorrhea and leucorrhea, "Cardell-Sheehy Vaginal Suppositories" can be used externally as suppositories. Patients can self-treat at home every day according to the diagram and instructions, and the effect is even better, with a high success rate. There is absolutely no case of failure.

### Salvaging Orchitis

The testicle is an important organ for producing sperm, and its importance to our survival is well known. However, the hateful gonorrhea often takes advantage of people's unpreparedness and attacks this important reproductive fortress, leading to the loss of life functions, which is truly terrible. Therefore, we must quickly treat gonorrheal orchitis without hesitation. Otherwise, the gonorrhea will become more and more severe, and it will spread uncontrollably. I have been in clinical practice for twenty years. If the patient's testicle has not become completely hardened, there is still a way to remedy it. The following case is clear evidence, and readers can pay attention to it!

Patient Li Shuchun, 24 years old, from Liyang, Jiangsu, a businessman. He contracted gonorrhea two years ago and once recovered by injuring himself. The following year, because his elderly mother was eager to have a grandson, she told him to return home to get married. Li was still single in Shanghai. After getting married, he enjoyed his honeymoon life. However, the old poison recurred, causing orchitis due to gonorrhea infection. The testicles were swollen and painful, and he walked awkwardly. Sitting felt like a heavy object was hanging down. After a long period of treatment, it was about to harden. Fortunately, through the introduction of Zhu Zhujun, he came to me for treatment. After I used scientific methods to examine him, I diagnosed him with gonorrheal epididymitis, and it seemed that there was a tendency for internal suppuration. Therefore, I urgently used the special gonorrhea drug "Krellinnon" to produce a special effect of anti-gonorrheal bacteria. On the other hand, I also used German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy, and ordered the patient to rest at home. This treatment took only five weeks before he was completely cured. Later, scientific methods of serum examination were used to prove that there was absolutely no gonorrheal reaction. From this day on, twenty numbers are sent to the clinic every day, and each number costs only five cents.

### The Decline in Financial Spot Gold Remains Slight; Xiamen Gang Continues to Purchase, with Only a Five-Yuan Difference Throughout the Day

Yesterday, the spot gold grey market continued to be flat and weak, but the range of fluctuations in the middle was still narrow, with only a five-yuan difference throughout the day. The situation showed a trend of first falling and then rising. Although a certain gold shop continued to purchase on behalf of the Xiamen Gang, the gold shops and money exchange businesses were both engaged in arbitrage selling, and the jewelry shops also came to sell. Therefore, the underlying trend once declined, reaching the 2,060-yuan mark. Subsequently, the buying interest of the Xiamen Gang revived, and the jewelry shops also switched from selling to buying, so the price turned upward, resulting in a final decline of only two yuan. All parties were observing with long-term considerations because they were aware of the uncertain situation in Europe, so they were all bearish, but there were no futures buyers. The volume of transactions was similar to the previous day, totaling five hundred and several tens of taels. Jewelry gold was listed at one yuan less. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Declined by Two Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), sellers initially called for 2,065 yuan. However, at that time, most buyers were waiting and watching. Although many parties depreciated the price by three or four yuan, it was still difficult to find a counterpart, so there was no opening for a long time. Until 10:15 AM, a certain gold shop continued to absorb purchases on behalf of the Xiamen Gang, and then transactions were seen. First, a certain gold shop advanced 50 taels each to the cash gold shop and colleagues, all at a price of 2,063 yuan, which was the opening price, three yuan lower than the previous closing price. After the opening, the same price was used, and the jewelry shops also mutually traded 50 taels. Soon, the money exchange business provided 20 taels to the jewelry shops, at a price of 61 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop came to purchase and absorb 50 taels from colleagues and 50 taels from the money exchange business, all at a price of 63 yuan. After that, the absorbing power of the certain gold shop weakened, so the trend continued to decline. At 11:20 AM, the jewelry shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange business, at a price of 60 yuan. Afterwards, those who entered still had a liking for the above price, but the sellers held back. By noon, no transactions were seen, so the noon closing price was still 60 yuan. In the afternoon, the underlying trend turned better, because the Xiamen Gang continued to absorb purchases in secret. First, the jewelry shops advanced 50 taels to the advance exchange business, at a price of 62 yuan. A certain gold shop advanced 50 taels to the money exchange business, at a price of 60 yuan. Then, they advanced 30 taels to the money exchange business, at a price of 65 yuan. Finally, at 4:10 PM, the cash gold shop advanced 50 taels to the money exchange business, at a price of 2,064 yuan, which was the late closing price. As a result, the closing price was two yuan lower than the previous evening's closing price. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was 2,070 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,060 yuan. The current standard gold was listed at 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed at One Yuan Less

The initial price of jewelry gold per tael was unchanged. By noon, because the spot gold noon closing price had fallen to the 60-yuan mark, it was also listed at one yuan less. Da Tong Hang changed to list at 209 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang listed at 207 yuan, purchasing at 201 yuan.

British Pure Gold Unchanged

The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged, calculated at 1,207 yuan and 60 cents.

### Foreign Exchange Stable; Transactions Sparse; Hong Kong Exchange Rate Continues to Rise

Yesterday, although foreign firms continued to purchase in the foreign exchange market, the supply from non-specialized firms such as HSBC remained unabated. Therefore, the supply and demand corresponded, resulting in an extremely stable situation. As a result, there were no gains or losses. The volume of transactions in the morning was also quite sparse. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, because the money exchange businesses were selling quite vigorously, the situation continued to trend towards relaxation.

In the early morning, the London big bars were flat in both near and far terms. The New York silver price remained stable. London raw gold also showed no increase or decrease. The exchange rates for British currency against American currency and against Shanghai currency remained flat. Against French currency, it fell by three cents.

The central listing of various exchange rates remained as before. The morning opening selling price of banks was 8 pence and 25 for British currency and 16 yuan and 0.0625 for American currency, which was the same as the previous evening's closing price. After the opening, although foreign firms came to purchase, non-specialized firms were quite willing to supply, so the situation was uneventful. Foreign firms settled with HSBC, and the HSBC listing remained unchanged. The announcement of the white silver balance tax also showed no increase or decrease, still levying 5.00 percent. After that, foreign firms continued to purchase for settlement. A certain bank purchased American currency at 16 yuan and 0.0625. Then, a certain bank crossed and sold American dollar bills to Da Tong at 16 yuan and 0.1875. Therefore, the process remained largely unchanged. Near noon, the money exchange businesses frequently stuffed Hong Kong currency, selling Hong Kong currency to foreign firms, Dutch Anda, and a certain bank, from 56 yuan to 56 yuan and 0.125, causing the market price to be slightly cheaper. By noon, the bank selling price was 8 pence and 25 for British currency and 16 yuan and 0.0625 for American currency, which was the same as the morning opening price. As a result, there was no increase or decrease compared to the previous closing price, while the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to rise by 1.25. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday.

### To Avoid Wasting Interest, Foreign Currency is Released

Yesterday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. In this city, the foreign exchange needs of various foreign firms were very strong, and the supply from foreign banks was quite smooth. The market price was as stable as before. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The opening of spot gold was weak, and gold shops and jewelry businesses were selling very vigorously. Retail absorption was sluggish, and the momentum was very weak. In the afternoon, money exchange businesses, retailers, etc., slightly absorbed, and the declining trend was slightly improved. Transactions were rare, and fluctuations were very narrow. The result was slightly soft, because the European situation was tense, people were panicked, and the intention of buyers was waning, resulting in a stalemate. Wealthy people were very eager to release foreign currency British and American gold pounds, and many were also selling British and American dollar bills to avoid wasting interest. Banks and money exchange businesses did not have strong demand, and prices slightly declined. Hong Kong currency showed signs of relaxation. Japanese fresh dollar bills continued to trend weakly. Public Zeng's transactions were extremely rare. Only Qin Qin sold 200 yuan of American dollar bills to Heng Mao.

### Securities: Foreign Debt Prices Fluctuate; Domestic Debt Prices Mainly Rise

In the securities grey market, yesterday's market situation can be described as firm and stable. The rise was very slight and not strong. Generally, there were many speculative trading activities, but there were relatively few buyers, resulting in a temporary stability and stability of market prices. The large bullish forces never let go because the environment was still brewing. Once there was definite news of peace, the exchange would inevitably open, and the market price would inevitably rise again. Yesterday's situation: At the opening, Category A was purchased by Yongkang, Category B was absorbed by No. 4, and other categories were purchased by Da Feng and No. 22. Those who sold Category B and bought Category D, hoping to win the lottery, were Tiansheng No. 35 and Tongkang Songmao. There were also sellers. In the afternoon, transactions were very clear. Both buyers and sellers were not very enthusiastic. In general, the bullish forces still dominated, and the result continued to be good, rising from 5 cents, 10 cents to 35 cents. The total number of transactions was more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

London Chinese Foreign Debt Listed Market Prices on the 11th of this month (Tuesday): The prices of various debts fluctuated. The Feakes Airplane Debt Note rose by 1 pound, with the price being 17 pounds. The original and continued issued debts of the Jinpu Railway each rose by half a pound, with the price being 17 pounds and a half. The British-German continued loan British issued debt note and the Sino-French American dollar 5% public bond with printed debt notes each fell by half a pound. The former's price was 68 pounds, and the latter's price was 64 pounds and a half. Also, the 6th market price of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bond rebounded by 5 shillings, which was a misprint in the original report and should be corrected. The remaining varieties remained unchanged. The supply of actual goods in London: British Gold Rehabilitation Public Bonds British issued debt notes of 2,000 pounds were sold at a price of 51 pounds and 15 shillings, 5 shillings higher than the market price. Also, German issued printed debt notes of 3,000 pounds were sold at a price of 47 yuan and 15 cents, 3 pounds and 15 shillings lower than the British issued price. Jinpu Railway continued issued public bonds British issued debt notes of 2,000 pounds were sold at a price of 18 pounds and 5 shillings, 15 shillings higher than the market price.

Stock Market: London British-owned Far East company stocks listed market prices on the 11th of this month (Tuesday) continued to decline. The Jardine Matheson Bank stock fell back by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with the price being 8 pounds. The HSBC Bank stock each fell by half a pound. The British registered stock fell to 82 pounds and a half. The Hong Kong registered stock fell to 84 pounds and a half. The Kailuan Mining Bureau stock fell back by 6 pence, with the price being 17 shillings and 6 pence. The Kula Klang Rubber stock fell by 7 pence and a half, with the price being 16 shillings and 10 pence and a half. Also, the 6th report Shanghai Waterworks A share fell by 5 shillings, which was a misprint in the original report and should be corrected. The remaining varieties remained unchanged.

Shanghai Public Trade Association reported that the stock market situation was flat, and prices were slightly lower. Holders withdrew and watched, and there were also fewer new buyers, because it was clear that the subsequent international situation was still unstable. The Jardine Matheson stock did not change much, hovering between the 20 yuan price. The Yesson Dock stock was traded at a price of 100 yuan. Rubber raw material prices fell slightly. It was expected that the US government intends to exchange cotton and wheat for rubber and tin in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Rubber users should therefore stop purchasing. There was also intense propaganda in all parties that the production of rubber should be increased. If this is the case, the raw material market should have a bad atmosphere. However, this statement cannot be confirmed now. If this is implemented, it is expected that the rubber stocks in this city will not be affected, because even though the price may be reduced slightly due to the increase in production, the profits from the increased production of raw materials by various companies will be more. Last week, the British rubber inventory decreased by more than 1,300 tons.

The Shanghai Securities Market traded 50 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Stock, with the price being 6 yuan and 40 cents.

### Yarn and Cotton: Inventory is Thin; Ten-Count Coarse Yarn Prices Rise Uniquely; Shenxin Factory Continues to Open Two Thousand Bales of "Celestial Girl" Yarn

The yarn market is still in a stable situation, but the price of 20-count yarn is increasing because the factory's production has increased and the inventory is relatively strong. The demand in various places in South China, such as Yunnan, Hong Kong, Chaozhou, and Shantou, has improved day by day, and the volume is huge. The market price should rise, but there are many holders of goods who do not have the concept of raising prices and follow the trend, so the upward trend of the market is advancing in a roundabout way. However, the raw materials for 10-count coarse yarn are lacking, and the output of various factories has decreased. The inventory is thin, and the factories generally have no inventory. The selling price has escaped the difficulties of fine yarn and is moving forward. The prices of 32-count single yarn and 42-count double-strand thread are also in a quiet situation as the spot goods are lacking. Observing the overall trend of the yarn market, it will not escape the state of hesitation for the time being. In the afternoon, Hong Kong gang transactions were still healthy, and they rebounded again.

Situation of current yarn: At the opening of the morning, the market felt more lively, and the atmosphere was still tight, because the customer sales were good, so the selling prices of various goods were called a step higher. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse and "Celestial Girl" yarn increased by one yuan. The price of 42-count Qian yarn continued to rise due to strong demand. The Tianjin gang had a healthy appetite for 10-count coarse yarn, and the Yunnan gang followed suit, and the factory's quota was almost completely searched. By the closing, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell back because the base was loose and everyone was vying to sell at a high price. The closing price of Double Horse was 390 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the market was on the rise due to the lack of real needs. The current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by two yuan, at 392 yuan. As a result, the statistics of various departments buying went to 1,563 bales for the whole day, and 240 bales were traded in the afternoon of the previous day, totaling 1,803 bales. The market price of 20-count "Celestial Girl" and Double Horse was about the same as the price of the previous day, but the price of 10-count coarse yarn alone rose by 3-4 yuan. 32-count and 42-count were flat. The Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 20 bales of 20-count "Celestial Girl" yarn, with the price being 389 yuan, for the period from April to September. The Yong'an Factory opened 160 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn, with the price being 400 yuan. The Xinyu Factory opened 100 bales of 10-count Double Globe yarn, with the price being 308 yuan, and 50 bales of 16-count Double Globe yarn, with the price being 370-371 yuan. Today, 750 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, and 180 pieces were shipped to Yantai. The amounts bought by each gang are listed on the left.

Same Trade 660 Yunnan 120

Hong Kong 513 Mainland 90

Tianjin 290 Shantou 30

Northern Gang 100 Total 1,803

Japanese yarn market: Due to the stagnation of real demand, there were often days with markets but no sales. However, the trading of wins and losses in the next month was extremely lively. Imports were frequent, and market prices fluctuated from time to time. As a result, the current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 359-360 yuan, and the current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 356 yuan, up 2-3 yuan from the previous day.

### Local Cotton is Virtually Stagnant; Manufacturers Switch to Purchasing American and Indian Cotton

The local cotton business is as flat as if it were stagnant. This is because the sources from all routes are interrupted. Zhejiang cotton is affected by the river closure and is difficult to transport out. It relies solely on the Subei route, which has a small amount of goods arriving, but the amount is decreasing day by day. As for the factories, although they have the intention of starting to handle it, there are also no goods to smoothly enter. Therefore, it has become a desolate scene. Some manufacturers have shifted their target to foreign cotton. However, the quality of Indian cotton is poor, and the factories are extremely reluctant to purchase it. However, under this environment, it is not enough to remedy the situation without adopting foreign cotton. Therefore, many are starting to handle American cotton. Only 480 bales of Tongzhou cotton have arrived at the pier. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market still shows no improvement. Washington has not yet released any documents on cotton industry issues. Yesterday, it was rumored that the US government planned to use a loan of 5 million bales of cotton to exchange for 600,000 tons of rubber, but this statement could not be confirmed. If it can be implemented, cotton prices may have a chance to turn around. Yesterday, New York fell by 1-4 pounds. India, including forecasts, fell by half a rupee. Egypt was flat. Yesterday, the exchange rate did not change compared to the previous one. Converted into legal tender, the cotton prices are estimated to have fallen by 20 cents per dan for American cotton and Brazilian cotton, fallen by 20 cents for Indian cotton, and risen slightly by 40 cents for Egyptian cotton.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading: Yarn prices have been more active in recent days, so the cotton market has shown a slight turnaround. Therefore, there have been sporadic transactions in recent days, but large-scale orders are still pending. In the past few days, due to the brisk sales of coarse yarn, most of the raw cotton purchased by various factories has been short-fiber cotton. Yesterday, Shenxin advanced 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, Hefeng advanced 500 bales of American cotton, and Anda advanced 200 bales of Indian cotton. The cotton market prices yesterday, converted to factory delivery prices, are recorded below:

### Soybean Cake: Soybean Oil Still Sold Secretly; Market Prices Slightly Rebound, Then Decline

Yesterday, soybean oil rose sharply and then declined slightly. The source of Lian Oil has not completely disappeared. It seems that Xintai, a Japanese company in the past, secretly sold it, and there is also a saying that foreign firms such as Lulin Foreign Firm also sold it. The next period in March can also be settled, leading to a decline in confidence. However, the appetites of various routes are concentrated in Shanghai, so there is a general situation of a drop in the bucket. Yesterday, a total of more than 400 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded, with the price opening at 42 yuan and 50 cents. As a result, the closing price was 41 yuan, 35 cents. Lianqi large baskets opened 150 pieces, with the price being 39 yuan. Peanut oil was unchanged. Only 120 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, with the price also opening at 34 yuan.

### North and South Goods: White Lotus is High; Sugar is Transported from Shantou and Hong Kong

Due to traffic difficulties, the source of Lanxi White Lotus is extremely lacking, and the price has risen frequently. Recently, both the Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs have appetites for sales, and the market price has risen again. Yesterday, it was sold to 120 yuan in cash, which is about to rise by more than 10 yuan before and after.

On the 12th, 300 bags of sugar were imported from Hong Kong, another 540 bags from Shantou, another 190 bags from Beihai, and another 117 bags of cold sugar from Hong Kong.

### Food: Foreign Flour is Being Dumped; Factory Flour Prices Rebound by 5 Cents; Wheat Arriving Earlier Has Been Exhausted; City Inventory Feels Lacking

Factory flour: The factory prices of current flour have been loosened in the past few days. The customer sales in the north and south have been pretty good in recent days, but the appetites for sales are quite emphasized. After a large batch of foreign flour arrived on the market recently, the Northern Ocean Gang has transported away a lot, and the factory flour has been affected. Therefore, starting yesterday, the factory has lowered the factory prices by 2.5-5 cents for the sake of competition. Both the north and south gangs have new transactions, but the wholesale prices in this street have not changed, still holding at 4 yuan and 40 cents. A total of more than 40,000 bags were traded in the city, and the market environment was generally flat.

Foreign flour: Yesterday's market situation was still stable. Recently, due to reports of price increases in overseas telegrams, there were few long-term fixed flour transactions. The floating inventory of current foreign flour on the market has been reduced after being favored by Japanese customers for several days, so the sellers are very reluctant to change. However, the market has also seen little special development amid the low prices of factory flour. It is said that brands such as the Bat, Double Eagle, and Lamp Model are still sold at 4 yuan and 30 cents, while the Sailing Boat brand must be added by 5 cents, and the old brand Red Sun must be 4 yuan and 30 cents in cash. More than 20,000 bags were also traded.

Wheat: Yesterday's transactions trended back to quiet. The new Jiangnan and Jiangbei wheat that arrived in the past two days has been searched and handled by North China, resulting in a lack of city inventory again. At present, the raw materials for various flour mills, in addition to foreign wheat orders arriving one after another, are also being handled by local wheat from the producing areas. Therefore, they rarely pay attention to the city goods, and the customer gangs have also stopped watching one after another due to the lack of goods to handle. Even the few sporadic arrivals have been secretly absorbed by the Japanese flour mills, so the market transactions have virtually stopped again.

### Shippers are Willing to Sell; Prices of Thick and Thin Japonica Rice are Slightly Soft

Yesterday, a total of three called numbers arrived from various gangs in the river, and a total of more than 2,000 bags from CheLunBaoZi and Suzhou, Tongkun, and Kunshan gangs. Arrivals are rare, and the sellers' thoughts have become firm. However, in terms of the sales market, this street is weak, and the hoarders are also sluggish, so the market is settled. However, there are also shippers who are willing to sell, so the prices of thick and thin Japonica rice have all shown a slightly soft body. Du Yangjian, Bu Jian, and Bian Yuan still hold firm to the original prices due to similar supply and demand.

### Customer Xian Rice Sales are Weak, Reversing the Corner Angle

Yesterday's market for customer Xian rice still lacked wholesale transactions from customer gangs and trading hoards. The appetite for sales on this street was weak, and the price of the river Bu Jian reported small. The sources of Wu Xian rice were continuous, and new arrivals were piled up at the Hongkou depots. Subsequent batches were still arriving at the port, so importers wanted to watch and wait before handling again. Yesterday's market only opened more than 1,000 bags, and the market price reversed the corner by a few cents. High Wu Xian rice only opened at 13 yuan and 25 cents. However, the supply of Saigon rice was dry, and the shippers insisted on not letting it go lightly. Yesterday, the original package wholesale price increased by 5 cents, with the price opening at 17 yuan and 25 cents. High Saigon rice was called to 17 yuan, 50-60 cents.

### Silk and Tea

### Thriving Raw Silk Sales by American and French Firms – Indian and African Silk Markets Stir After Prolonged Stagnation

Overseas silk markets generally remained firm yesterday, although some slight price declines were reported for certain forward contracts, but this was not considered significant. In New York, the May contract fell two cents, while raw silk opened at its original price. Japanese silk spot prices rose five to seven cents. In Yokohama, spot prices for raw silk in the morning market were at a small five yuan, while forward prices were at a small eleven yuan. In Lyon, Chinese silk opened at its original price, while Japanese silk rose two francs. Considering the fluctuations in overseas silk prices, spot goods remain in an advantageous position. Given the strong sales seen solely by Japanese firms in American and French ports, the future of silk prices seems to be brewing. Moreover, silk markets in various regions have shown firmness and stability for over a week. Subsequently, silk prices may rise again.

In the local silk market, due to the stability of both domestic and overseas silk prices, and after suffering from the manipulation of speculators for months, foreign silk sales have become active amidst this stable and firm silk market. Yesterday, silk transactions continued to be active. Transactions of high-grade white filature silk from French firms and 7/8 filature 20-34 from American firms for April contracts were made, with Xinfu, Dachang, and other firms engaging in hundreds of bales of trade. According to market records, besides the firm prices of fine French filature silk from firms like Chongyu, American firms' evenness silk even rose slightly by ten yuan compared to the previous day. However, the sentiment in the silk market has clearly shifted from bearish to bullish. Transactions of Jing silk from Zhejiang remained sluggish, with a price difference of thirty yuan compared to domestic and overseas prices. The Indian and African silk markets, having been quiet for a long time, seemed to be stirring after seeing active sales from British and French firms recently. However, due to the significant price difference between domestic and overseas markets, no deals were made for the time being.

Nine pieces of yellow silk arrived from Hong Kong, along with 977 packages of tea.

### Piece Goods

### Fine Yarn Prices Soar Daily – Dyeing Factories Pre-Order Autumn Goods – Huge Volume Transactions in Coarse Cloth for June, July, August – Price of White Goods and Fine Twill Up by Ten to Twenty Cents per Bolt

Domestic Cloth: The market continues to be good, mainly because the raw materials for fine yarn are rising daily, and dyeing factories are working hard to pre-order autumn goods from various factories. Orders for various gray fabrics are being placed much earlier than in previous years. Current sales of seasonal goods such as Tiao Zifu silk, bleached cloth, foreign yarn, striped bleached cloth, and printed piece goods are still good, and market prices are gradually rising. Therefore, even during the summer off-season, factories still need to speed up deliveries, resulting in very stable sentiment. There have been substantial transactions in both coarse and fine gray fabrics for June, July, and August, causing the factory prices to continue to rise. The price of white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill has increased by ten to twenty cents per bolt, with over 800 pieces being offered. Resale of goods by fellow merchants has also followed this upward trend. Coarse cloth from Ewo, which has not increased in price, is gradually becoming cheaper than the products of Lu factories, attracting customer purchases. Wholesale shops on this street purchased over 300 bales. Customers from Guangdong are showing strong demand, with transactions mostly consisting of dyed fine twill, totaling over 2,000 bolts. Merchants from Fujian are purchasing bleached cloth, Fuchou silk, colored cloth, and colored twill, totaling over 200 pieces. Due to the scarcity of ships from Sichuan and Yunnan, leading to congested cargo conditions, purchasing appetite has decreased.

East Cloth: In the morning market, sales of fine cloth and fine twill appeared weak, with both local and actual sales being sluggish. Market sentiment is hesitant. The price of various types of fine cloth has fallen sharply, with 12-pound Longtou hitting a low of 12.65 yuan. Subsequently, because Ewo purchased over 200 bales, settling prices at 12.70 to 12.75 yuan, although there were no major transactions from customers, there were still 500 to 600 pieces on this street, so the market turned tight. Longtou fine cloth was at 12.80 yuan, and Longtou fine twill was at 12.60 yuan, down about five cents per bolt compared to the previous morning market. Observing the situation, the market is tired yet stable.

Today, 310 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin, and another 330 pieces were exported to Yantai.

### Imports and Exports

### Sunflower Fans and Construction Wood Continue to Arrive

As the sales season for sunflower fans is approaching, there have been frequent arrivals recently. Yesterday, another 1,330 pieces arrived from Hong Kong.

The arrival of construction wood continues unabated. Yesterday, 39,340 pieces arrived from Fuzhou.

### Medicinal Materials

### Supplies of Caokou Nuts from Renhao Brand are Running Out

Recently, the demand for Caokou nuts from merchants in the Yangtze River area has been very strong, leading to active trade. Normally, the selling price of this product is no more than twelve or thirteen yuan per picul, but now the market price has risen to twenty yuan. Furthermore, due to limited inventory, supplies of Renhao brand goods will soon be completely sold out.

To strengthen coastal defenses, Zhejiang Province has prohibited navigation in Haimen and Ningbo and promulgated an outline of measures for controlling water and land transportation. Heavy troops are stationed in various locations, with strict alert levels. Japanese aircraft have been sighted over Zhejiang East, and Japanese warships have been sighted off the coast of Zhejiang. Details are as follows:

Strengthening Defenses and Promulgating Guidelines

The Zhejiang Provincial Government has promulgated an outline of measures for controlling water and land transportation in wartime, aiming to strengthen coastal defenses and enhance transportation efficiency to facilitate the smooth sale of local products and promote new economic development. The management of water and land transportation tools within the province, whether government-owned, privately-owned, powered, or manual, will be managed according to the regulations of this outline, under the direction of the Transportation Department. At the same time, important military areas have fortifications built, with heavy troops stationed and strict alert levels maintained.

Wenzhou as the Only Open Port

All coastal ports in Zhejiang East, except for Ningbo, Haimen, and Wenzhou, have been successively closed to navigation. Docks such as Longshan have also been demolished. The Jiaojiang River in Haimen has now been completely blocked, and Zhenhai in Ningbo has strictly prohibited ships from entering or leaving. Therefore, Wenzhou is currently the only port in Zhejiang East temporarily allowed for navigation. The Oujiang River in Wenzhou has a blockade line built at Qingshi, but there is a gap left in the blockade line to allow ships to enter and exit. Ships entering and exiting must first anchor at Jiangxin for inspection before being allowed to dock.

Japanese Planes Fly over Zhejiang for Reconnaissance and Bombing

In the morning, a Japanese plane intruded into the airspace over Yueqing City, scattering absurd leaflets. At the same time, a Japanese plane was sighted in Ruian, also scattering leaflets. On the eighth, several Japanese planes bombed Jiangshan and Qu County, with the targets being the airfield and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway station. However, the bombs all fell on wasteland, causing no local damage. It is reported that Yushan in Jiangxi was also bombed, with bombs falling into the city, destroying many houses and injuring civilians.

Japanese Warships Patrol the Waters off Zhejiang East

Several Japanese warships are anchored in Hangzhou Bay, seemingly with some intent towards Zhejiang East. On the seventh, a single-funnel Japanese warship was sighted off the coast of Yueqing, passing through Shandamen and heading west. However, there are no traces of Japanese warships outside the Oujiang River estuary in Wenzhou, the Jiaojiang River estuary in Haimen, and the Zhenhai estuary in Ningbo. However, Japanese warships are frequently sighted patrolling off the coast of Zhejiang.

### Refugee Production Association

### Issues Statement of Purpose

The Shanghai Refugee Production Association has now selected 350 Yunnan Road as its headquarters and is actively preparing for its establishment. It has also issued a statement of purpose, which states: "Since the outbreak of the war, our compatriots in the interior have lamented the devastation of their homes and the desolation of their fields. Uprooted and displaced, they have gathered in Shanghai. Various charitable organizations in the city have exerted their utmost efforts to comfort the displaced and provide them with clothing and food. However, the war has dragged on indefinitely, and long-term relief is not only practically difficult but also ultimately insufficient in terms of resources and energy. Moreover, it places a burden on society, reduces economic benefits, buries the labor force of the nation, and easily breeds dependency. To wait for the end of the war and the repatriation of refugees is impractical. The war zone is in ruins, and only those who own small plots of land can return to farming. What will become of those who have lost their homes and jobs? After much deliberation, we believe that it is better to provide long-term support actively than to offer temporary relief passively. Requiring no large amount of capital, it can accommodate a large number of refugees in production. Requiring no sophisticated skills, it only needs common sense and labor. Nothing is better than setting up workshops and relocating them to cultivate land. There is an extremely large number of refugees in Shanghai, and it is imperative to find a solution to this problem. The best way to solve this problem is to set up simple workshops and relocate them to engage in agriculture. We hope that compatriots at home and abroad will work together to achieve this, benefiting both the national economy and the people's livelihoods."

### Kerosene Industry Implements Commission Donations

The Shanghai Kerosene Industry Association, since last year, has seen its members scattered, with only fifteen remaining. The scope of business has also shrunk by sixty to seventy percent, and the Nanshi headquarters was destroyed by artillery fire. However, it continues to actively support public welfare undertakings. It recently held a meeting and decided to implement a business commission starting from April this year, donating 2.5% per case of kerosene. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the industry group for record.

### Long-Term Relief for the Elderly, Weak, Women, and Children

The Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee believes that most of the refugees in the city's shelters are elderly, weak, women, and children, and they will need long-term support before the end of the war. Therefore, it hopes that all sectors of society will continue to support the adoption movement. According to the committee, the number of refugees adopted by all sectors of society has now reached 10,000.

### Portuguese Ship Data Detained Again – Portuguese Consul Lodges Protest Yesterday – Report Submitted to Minister, Preparing to Telegraph Japan for Negotiation – Portuguese Merchants Decide to Suspend Sailing Temporarily

After Japanese warships detained Portuguese merchant ships off the coast of Zhejiang and forced them back to Shanghai, the passengers of each ship have been completely released, but the goods are not allowed to be unloaded. The Portuguese ship Data, represented by Jardine Matheson, was detained again the day before yesterday. The Portuguese Consul General formally submitted a written protest yesterday and reported it to the Minister, preparing to telegraph the Minister to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. Details are as follows:

Monitoring Ships and Preventing Unloading

The eight ships, including Tangbei, Tangqiao, Tanglu, Mida, Hailong, Libao, Rude, and Baode, were allowed by Japanese warships to sail into Wusong Port one after another and are now docked at Yangshupu Piers 16, 17, and 18. Although the passengers have been completely released, the ships are still under surveillance by Japanese warships. Japanese soldiers are stationed on each ship, prohibiting the ships' radio stations from sending telegrams, preventing the ships' radio stations from communicating with the company. As for the ship crew, from the captain to the sailors, they all remain on board, and the goods loaded on board are not allowed to be unloaded.

Portuguese Ship Data Detained Again

The Portuguese ship Data, represented by Jardine Matheson, runs the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, mainly carrying cargo. After arriving in Shanghai from Wenzhou, it docked at the Longmao Pier in Pudong to unload cargo. The day before yesterday, after the cargo was unloaded, it was preparing to sail to Pier 31 in Yangshupu to dock when it was detained by Japanese warships. It is now also docked at Pier 17, guarded and monitored by Japanese soldiers. However, since it is an empty ship, there are no goods. The crew members are all staying on board. However, according to Jardine Matheson, the ship belongs to the Portuguese Far East Company, but the Far East Company does not recognize it.

Portuguese Consul Lodges Written Protest Yesterday

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Portuguese Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday that the Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Alves, had visited the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, and the Japanese naval authorities to inquire about the detention of Portuguese merchant ships. After verifying the facts, based on the reports of various national shipping merchants, he formally submitted a written protest to the Japanese Consul in Shanghai, Miura, at 10:00 am yesterday. It is said that the content of the protest letter was very firm, demanding the immediate release of the merchant ships and guaranteeing that similar incidents would not occur again.

Reporting to the Minister and Telegraphing Japan for Negotiation

According to shipping sources, after the detained Portuguese ships were forced to fly the Japanese flag, the Portuguese flags of each ship were taken down. At that time, negotiations with the Portuguese shipowners were ineffective. Because the removal of the national flag concerns government sovereignty, the Portuguese merchants are very angry and have reported to the Portuguese Consul General to protest to Japan. It is also heard that the Portuguese Consul General has reported to the Portuguese Minister to China, preparing to telegraph the Portuguese Minister to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. At the same time, all the ships of the Portuguese merchant ship companies, after consultation, have decided to suspend sailing temporarily.

Portuguese Merchants Suspend Sailing

After the Portuguese merchant ships decided to suspend sailing, (1) the Portuguese ships docked in Shanghai are: Merrill's ship Meifa, Zhengde's ship Shantaii, Huamei's ship Tangsai, Wanguo's ship Xinde, and Far East's ship Fade. (2) The Portuguese ships docked in Wenzhou are: Wanguo's ship Minhe and Far East's ship Damao. Before the detention of the Portuguese ships is resolved, they will all temporarily suspend sailing. Therefore, there are currently no Portuguese ships sailing along the coast.

Italian and German Merchant Ships Uniquely Sail to Wenzhou

After the Portuguese merchant ships suspended sailing, the Shanghai-Wenzhou route is uniquely sailed by German and Italian ships. (1) Yihua Foreign Firm's Shili and Lulin Foreign Firm's Feikang, both Italian and German ships, completed customs clearance yesterday and will sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou today. (2) Zhongyi Company's Deping and Lihe Foreign Firm's Haifu, both Italian and German ships, are scheduled to complete customs clearance tomorrow and sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day after tomorrow. (3) Although British ships from Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have been approved to sail the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, there have been no ships sailing recently.

Negotiating for the Return of Mail on Each Ship

The detained Portuguese ships, such as Merrill's ship Mida and Atlantic's ship Hailong, are loaded with mailbags sent from Shanghai to Wenzhou or from Wenzhou to Shanghai. The Shanghai Postal Administration has negotiated with the Japanese side for the return of these mailbags. The Japanese side has agreed to the request and allowed the return. As for the current mail and packages from Shanghai to Wenzhou, they are carried by Baolide and other ships.

### The Mystery of Wang Jingwei's Arrival in Shanghai

### Still Unable to Be Confirmed to This Day

### Zhou Fohai's Activities in Shanghai

Since Wang Jingwei colluded with Konoe, established a secret agreement, and sang the tune of peace, practically betraying the party and the country, he has been unanimously rejected by the people of the country, and telegrams have been sent to the central government, requesting his arrest to uphold the law. It is said that Wang's wild ambitions have not been curbed and he is still plotting activities. Recently, it was widely rumored in the city that he had arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and was hiding somewhere in Hongkou. However, a reporter from Modern News Agency inquired with relevant parties, and as of yesterday, it was still impossible to confirm this rumor. Well-informed sources firmly believe that Wang has left Hanoi, which is a fact, but it is still difficult to determine whether he is in Hong Kong or Guangzhou. According to other sources, Zhou Fohai and other members of Wang's gang have indeed arrived in Shanghai and have been very active in recent days. They are also planning to publish a reactionary newspaper in the city similar to the "Xin Shen Bao," with the office located on Baker Road, reportedly named the "Far East Daily," which will be used to numb the people's minds. However, the people of the country are united in their hatred of the enemy and will never be seduced by it.

### Shanghai Jewish Refugee Relief

### Requires 10,000 Yuan Daily

### Relief Committee Quite Anxious

### Continued Arrivals May Lead to Famine

The Continental News reports that there are now 6,500 German Jewish refugees in Shanghai, and providing them with food and lodging costs about 350,000 yuan per month, or more than 10,000 yuan per day. The figure of 6,500 is still a vague estimate. The number of refugees registered with the committee handling refugee affairs has exceeded 6,000, but the exact number of those who are self-sufficient and have not registered is unknown. It is said that there are as many as 8,000 people in total. It is estimated that the world can absorb 3,000 refugees per month, but it is expected that more than 3,000 Jewish refugees will arrive in Shanghai alone next month. Therefore, by the end of next month, there will be 10,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai. The committee needs to raise 1 million yuan per month to maintain operations. Of course, Shanghai is unable to raise this amount of money and can only donate a portion of it. The committee is currently struggling to find the funds needed to care for the 7,000 refugees it is currently looking after.

Quite Uncertain. If 1 million yuan is needed per month, it will be impossible to bear this heavy burden. After the 3,000 refugees arriving on a special ship next month, there are still regular liner ships scheduled to sail to Shanghai, with one ship every two weeks, carrying an average of 300 to 500 refugees per ship. The Conte Biancamano, which arrives in Shanghai on April 25, will carry 600 men, women, and children. All the committee members are working overtime, and some members believe that unless foreign governments donate funds, it will be

Difficult to Continue. Some members are more optimistic and are currently trying to consult with the League of Nations. Most of the refugees in Shanghai are living in shelters, and many are crossing the Suzhou Creek to the south bank to seek employment. In general, the seriousness of the situation of Jewish refugees in Shanghai is underestimated due to the calm attitude of the committee. In fact, the committee is having difficulty coping, which is its intention, because there are no deposits left, the situation is deteriorating daily, and thousands of men, women, and children are in danger of starvation.

### Rice Reserves in Shanghai Increase

### Rice Prices Have Stabilized

### Rice Evaluation Committee's Second Survey of Rice Reserves

### Shows an Increase of Over 37,000 Bags Compared to the Previous Survey

In order to regulate rice prices and stabilize the livelihoods of the poor in Shanghai, the Rice Evaluation Committee conducted a survey of rice reserves within the two settlements. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the committee yesterday and was informed of the results of the second survey. A total of 638,547 bags of rice were stored in 97 rice stores, with each bag calculated as either 1.2 or 1.5 piculs, totaling over 900,000 piculs. This is an increase of 37,203 bags compared to the first survey. The China Bank warehouse still had the largest amount, with 113,481 bags, followed by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouse, with 103,009 bags in both the east and west warehouses. The committee has prepared a report and distributed it to relevant rice industry groups and the authorities of the two settlements for reference. The third survey will begin immediately and is scheduled to end around the 20th of this month. Regarding the selling prices of various rice stores, as the Qingming Festival has passed, rice merchants from various regions have resumed normal transportation, and the supply is increasing. The selling prices will fall again. Therefore, the selling prices of rice in the city have stabilized.

### Pork Merchants Firmly Oppose

### Japanese Merchants' Monopoly

### English Ship Loading Pigs Obstructed

### Decision Made to Suspend Sailing Temporarily

Japanese merchants are attempting to monopolize the fresh pork industry. The Continental Products Company is forcibly transporting fresh pigs from Xingang to Shanghai and collecting a pig tax of two yuan per head. Pork merchants have jointly resolved to firmly oppose this, hoping that Japanese merchants will stop the monopoly and abolish the exorbitant tax. It is reported that a declaration will be issued. Furthermore, the English ship Crystal, represented by Yuanlong Company, which was loading fresh pigs in Xingang, was obstructed by Japanese merchants from loading pigs. Therefore, it has been decided to suspend sailing temporarily.

### Danish Minister

### Returns Home on Leave

### Danish Consul in Shanghai Arrives to Take Office

The Continental News reports that the Danish Minister to China, A.H. Oxholm, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai today (April 12) with his family, returning to his country via Siberia. During Oxholm's absence, the embassy's counselor, Hille, will serve as acting minister.

The English-language North China Daily News reports that Andersen, the former Secretary of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was appointed Vice Consul of the Danish Consulate General in Shanghai on the 1st of this month and has recently arrived in Shanghai to take office.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Convenes

### Production Conference

### To Be Held in Chongqing on May 5

### Provincial Proposals Due by the End of the Month

In order to develop production and enrich the wartime economy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to convene a National Production Conference, which is scheduled to be held in Chongqing on May 5. County magistrates in charge of construction in all provinces will attend. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has also instructed provincial governments to investigate the current status of important industries, light industries, and defense industries in their respective provinces, as well as their opinions and methods for revitalizing domestic industries. These reports should be compiled and sent to the ministry before the end of this month so that they can be compiled into proposals for discussion at the conference.

### Malayan Authorities

### Restrict the Influx of Chinese Laborers

### Limit of 2,000 per Month

### Number of People from Qiongyai Going There Increases Daily

The Malayan authorities have stipulated that the number of Chinese laborers entering the country is limited to 2,000 per month. Shipping companies operating in that region will allocate passenger tickets to various ports. Before the fall of Haikou, 150 tickets to Malaya were allocated daily. Since the fall of Haikou, people from Qiongyai have been unable to travel abroad by ship from that port. Shipping companies have also transferred the tickets allocated to Haikou to other ports for sale. The Qiongyai Overseas Chinese Federation, recognizing that the number of Qiongyai compatriots seeking a living in Nanyang after the war is increasing daily, has specially negotiated with British Taikoo Company and others to have the tickets originally allocated to Haikou given to the Qiongyai people by the federation. The federation has now notified all fellow villagers that those who wish to go abroad from Hong Kong can register with the federation first, and the federation will handle the purchase of tickets for them in order of registration.

### Hongkou Residents

### Rent Houses for Profit

### Sublet at High Prices

### Japanese Authorities Have Prohibited It

The English-language North China Daily News reports that, according to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi, the Japanese naval authorities responsible for the recovery of the area north of the Suzhou Creek have recently warned the Japanese that anyone who uses the shortage of housing in the area to make improper profits from real estate will be expelled. The Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces Rehabilitation Department has obtained confirmation and will implement these harsh corrective measures. Houses owned by Chinese in the Hongkou and Kunlien areas are now rented out by the Japanese Residents Association on behalf of the homeowners, and the rent is transferred to the homeowners to prevent abuses. Some Japanese, taking advantage of the shortage of housing in the area, rent more houses from the association than they need and sublet them to others. The rent charged is sometimes three times higher than the rent paid to the Residents Association. Others rent houses, renovate them, and demand "excessive prices" for subletting the rooms to others. Some Japanese families live off the income from subletting houses in this way.

### Soybean Oil and Raw Oil

### Prices Soar

### Supply Manipulated

### Citizens Suffer

Since being placed under control, the various Shanghai Chinese merchant soybean oil companies have suffered considerable losses due to various restrictions, and the future of their business is even more bleak. However, unscrupulous merchants who only seek profit and disregard the law are taking the opportunity to hoard goods, causing market prices to rise. In the past two months, oil prices have soared without end. At the beginning of the month, the price of soybean oil had already risen to 37 or 38 yuan per hundred catties, and it is still rising. For example, Jiaozhou raw oil has risen to 34 yuan, Qingdao barrelled raw oil to 45 yuan, and Dalian soybean oil to 42.5 yuan. The price of Dahua Factory soybean oil in this port has also reached 32.7 or 32.8 yuan. Various sauce gardens and oil shops, due to the increased cost of incoming goods, have had to raise retail prices in order to cover their costs. Therefore, one yuan can buy less than two catties of oil, which has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Cai Yukun, the acting chairman of the Soybean Oil and Grain Industry Association, and Chen Ziyi, the supervisory committee member, recognizing that the rising prices of soybean oil are having a significant impact on people's livelihoods, have advised their colleagues not to be exploited and manipulate the market.

### Gunshots Heard Repeatedly in Western Shanghai

### Guerrillas Attack Japanese Troops Again

The China Mail reports that at around 10:15 pm last night (April 11), intermittent gunfire was clearly heard from Caodu, near Jessfield Road and Brenan Road, lasting for ten minutes. Heavy gunfire was heard in the Hongqiao area from early yesterday morning until about 7:00 am, confirming that guerrillas had attacked Japanese sentries in the area again.

### Detaiying Silk and Cloth Store

### Fails to Affix Stamp Tax to Account Books

The Xinsheng News Agency reports that all businesses in the city are required to affix stamp tax to all account books in accordance with the stamp tax regulations for extraordinary periods. However, the Detaiying Silk and Cloth Store on Avenue Edward VII failed to affix stamps to 21 account books opened this year and 17 items of invoices and receipts. When this was discovered, it was punished in accordance with the heavier penalties for extraordinary periods, with a fine of 785 yuan to serve as a warning.

### Japanese Troops Retreat from Tangqiao; Over Eighty Japanese Soldiers Annihilated; Guerrilla Forces Recapture the Town Simultaneously

Japanese troops stationed in Tangqiao, south of the Huangpu River, were ambushed several times by Ding's guerrilla unit. Yesterday (the 11th), relying on the assistance of the naval forces along the Huangpu River, they launched a sudden counterattack against the guerrillas late at night, attempting to encircle Ding's unit from the rear. However, they fell into an ambush set by the guerrillas. Machine guns fired from all directions, annihilating over eighty Japanese soldiers without a single survivor. The Japanese naval forces stationed along the Huangpu River, hearing the alarm, dared not linger and retreated hastily towards the west bank of the Huangpu River. The guerrillas pursued them to the shore, sinking one small motorboat and drowning over thirty Japanese soldiers. Consequently, the town was recaptured by Ding's unit.

Japanese Soldiers in Xinchang厌战 Commit Suicide

Over one hundred Japanese and "puppet" troops are currently stationed in Xinchang Town, Pudong, concentrated in the Wang Family Garden. However, Chinese guerrillas are scattered in the surrounding villages, launching surprise attacks from time to time, resulting in daily casualties for the Japanese and "puppet" troops. The Japanese soldiers feel quite dejected. The day before yesterday, at 9:00 AM, five Japanese and "puppet" soldiers were patrolling to the Yuhuanggang Bridge east of the town when they discovered a pair of leather shoes and a letter. They were greatly surprised and recognized the leather shoes as belonging to a Japanese sentry, but the sentry was nowhere to be found. They opened the letter and found that it was the sentry's suicide note. They then learned that the Japanese soldier had committed suicide by drowning himself in the river due to homesickness and厭战 (厭戰). They immediately reported to the Japanese headquarters, recovered the body from the Erzaogang River, and prohibited any publicity.

Japanese Military Supplies Difficult to Transport on the Yangtze River

The Japanese army on the central Yangtze River front line faces great difficulties in transporting various military supplies due to repeated transshipments. Yesterday morning, several transport ships loaded with a large number of military supplies and gasoline departed from Shanghai to replenish supplies on the Yangtze River. (1) The giant Japanese transport ship "Kitaki Maru" arrived from Japan with over 3,000 tons of gasoline and berthed at buoys 3 and 4 in Hongkou, where it was transferred to another transport ship, the "Tokyo Maru," for onward transport to the Yangtze River. (2) The transport ship "Saga Maru" loaded a large number of military trucks at the China Merchants North Wharf in Hongkou and sailed for the Yangtze River yesterday morning. (3) The transport ships "Yuanjiang Maru" and "Wulu Maru" loaded a large number of military supplies at the China Merchants Central Wharf in Hongkou and also sailed for the Yangtze River yesterday morning.

### Purchasing Goods in Zhejiang and Shanghai Remains Crowded; Frequent Freight Traffic on the Shanghai-Wenzhou Line; No Impact from the Zhenhai Blockade

It is learned that goods previously shipped from Shanghai to Ningbo that could not be imported due to the blockade of Zhenhai Port have now been rerouted via Shanghai-Wenzhou steamers to Zhejiang. Furthermore, it is learned that merchants from Zhejiang Province have been flocking to this port to purchase goods as before. Therefore, freight traffic between Zhejiang and Shanghai has not only not decreased due to the Zhenhai blockade but has also increased because of the peaceful situation in various parts of Zhejiang Province, with merchants requesting shipment of goods ordered from this port, resulting in a sudden increase in freight traffic between Shanghai and Wenzhou.

### Remnants of Fire in the Warehouse of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company Rekindle; Fire Engines Go Again to Pour Water for Over an Hour

The *North China Daily News* reports that at 6:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), several fire engines from the Hongkou Fire Brigade were called to the burnt-out warehouse of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company opposite the Japanese Consulate General on Wuchang Road to pour water for over an hour. This was because smoke was rising again from the remnants of the major fire on the evening of March 24th. Last night, according to the opinion of experts, it is common for the embers to rekindle in the rubble. They believe that some bales of cotton have been smoldering continuously since the initial fire and say that cotton can burn again for months after catching fire. The fire engines poured water into the rubble pile, completely soaking the interior of the warehouse before driving back.

### Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings from Past Dynasties; Crowded with Visitors for Days; Chinese and Foreign Connoisseurs Interested; Presentation of *Overview of the Origins of Chinese Painting*

The Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings from Past Dynasties opened at the Da Hsin Art Gallery the day before yesterday. It displays treasured paintings collected by over fifty famous collectors, encompassing genuine works of important calligraphers and painters from the Tang Dynasty to the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties.

### Puppets Wen Zongyao and Chen Qun, among Others, to Cross to Japan Tomorrow Morning to Flatter the Enemy; They Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Nanjing with a Gang of Scoundrels; This Trip Is to Report to the Japanese Side

Since the puppet organizations in various places were established one after another under the direction of the Japanese, the general run of shameless puppets, with faces that should be blushing with shame, serve the enemy and obey the Japanese in everything, with flattery and obsequiousness knowing no bounds. People like Liang Hongzhi, Zhang Binghui, and Su Xiwu have all crossed to Japan to flatter the enemy. Recently, Fu Xiaoan, Gao Guanwu, and others have also gone to Japan and have not yet returned. According to reliable sources from the foreign community, Wen Zongyao, the puppet "President of the Legislative Yuan of the Reformed Government," and Chen Qun, the "Minister of the Interior," in order to further betray the nation, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, accompanied by a gang of scoundrels including the puppet "Legislative Councilors" Zhu Dazhang, the "Secretary" Ye Jingshuang, Xu Benqian, an advisor to the "Ministry of the Interior" Lin Gengyu, as well as He Yong, Qin Moxiao and others, by train.

### Japanese and Puppet Goods Flood Guerrilla Areas

Japanese Goods Mostly Machinery and Tools

Puppet Goods Are Mostly Cereals and Vegetable Oils

After the war, under the protection of the Japanese, Japanese and puppet goods have been imported into China in large quantities for dumping. The areas they occupy are flooded with Japanese and puppet goods, affecting goods from Britain, the United States, Germany, and France. Imports increased sharply from January to March this year.

### Passing of Wang Liping's Respected Father; Memorial Service to Be Held in Shanghai Tomorrow

Mr. Wang Liping is a talented student of the well-known Mr. Zhang Jinhu and has served as section chief in the Shanghai Municipal Finance and Public Security Bureaus. He is known for his modesty and sincerity, and people from all walks of life are happy to associate with him. Last winter, his respected father, Mr. Ruitang, passed away in his hometown of Xuzhou. At that time, due to blocked roads, he was unable to return home to attend the funeral. Therefore, on the hundredth day after his death (April 14th of the Gregorian calendar), he is holding a memorial service at the Jingtu Nunnery on Guling Road in the International Settlement to express his filial piety.

### Opinions of Various Mass Organizations in This City on the Spiritual Mobilization (Continued) (End)

(5) Spiritual mobilization should be promoted in accordance with the implementation measures promulgated by the Supreme National Defense Council. The promotion of the National Spiritual Mobilization work and the holding of monthly meetings in various organizations, institutions, schools, factories, and shops in this city should be led by the persons in charge of the respective organizations, institutions, schools, factories, and shops and by the Spiritual Mobilization Association of this city. At the same time, all lower-level organizations and the entire masses should immediately launch the mobilization from the grassroots level with a spirit of initiative and self-awareness and should not wait for the upper levels to lead before proceeding. Because the main purpose of spiritual mobilization is to mobilize a wider range of people to participate in the war of resistance, the implementation of preliminary civil rights, such as the rights of election, impeachment, and referendum, should be carried out as much as possible in the practice of mobilization—that is, in the organization process. Only in this way can the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses in this movement be enhanced, can this movement become a truly mass movement, and can the National Monthly Meeting become a truly democratic mass organization.

(6) The holding of the National Monthly Meeting should strive to avoid empty rituals of opening meetings and making oaths and should transform passive articles into active mass actions. However, the prescribed rituals should not be disrupted. Leaders and the masses, principals and students, factory directors and workers, managers and shop assistants, all who participate in the spiritual mobilization movement and take the oath should strictly abide by the twelve articles stipulated in the National Public Charter, supervise and encourage each other. Then the so-called "not selling Japanese goods" and other passive articles will become active actions such as "boycotting Japanese goods."

(7) New, broad, and unified mass organizations should be established in the National Spiritual Mobilization, and mass organizations should be expanded through this. However, it is by no means that various mass organizations will therefore abandon their original work. Cultural circles, student circles, vocational circles, women's circles, and labor circles must extensively use the National Spiritual Mobilization as a guideline to call on and organize the unorganized and backward masses to come to all circles. However, cultural circles will not therefore abandon in-depth research into various academic subjects, student circles will not therefore abandon the pursuit of students' own welfare, women's circles will not therefore abandon the task of women's liberation, and workers' circles will not therefore abandon the appropriate improvement of workers' own lives. Therefore, National Spiritual Mobilization can be said to be a comprehensive and national organization that adapts to the major goal of resisting the war and building the country, and the original organizations and work of all circles are precisely the only foundation for promoting this national organization.

(8) Mobilization committees and national monthly meetings should be established quickly in all circles and groups to promote mobilization work. However, in view of Shanghai's special environment, if various groups, institutions, schools, factories, and shops cannot hold joint monthly meetings for the entire body, they should be divided into small groups, departments, grades, workshops, etc. to hold monthly meetings separately, and representatives should be elected from each small group, department, grade, workshop, etc. to organize a representative joint monthly meeting, so that there is no gap between the upper and lower levels.

(9) All circles, groups, institutions, schools, factories, and shops, as well as all small groups, grades, departments, and workshops, should formulate concrete measures for mutual competition and mutual inspection to seek the effective development of the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement.

(10) All circles, groups, institutions, schools, factories, and shops should select the principles of the National Spiritual Mobilization that are most relevant to their original work as the central work of spiritual mobilization. For example, the cultural circles should take correcting erroneous remarks, opposing pro-Japanese compromising ideas, and promoting the national morality of loyalty and forgiveness as their central tasks. Other circles can be inferred by analogy.

(11) All circles, schools, institutions, and factories should promote general spiritual mobilization. On the one hand, party and government personnel and seven-level elements should be responsible for leadership, but on the other hand, various groups must serve as the core of promotion and supervision. For example, in schools, factories, and shops, the principal, factory director, and manager should lead the declaration, but for the promotion of the entire work, the Education Association, the Student Union, the Trade Union, various vocational circles, and various sports groups must bear the responsibility for practical promotion, so as to achieve the effect of the party and government, all circles, and all levels working together.

(12) Due to the special environment of Shanghai, all circles should, as far as possible, initiate various new organizations in accordance with the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, which is indicated to match the environment of their own work. However, this organization must have a subordinate relationship with all circles and then be led and instructed by party and government agencies through all circles. Shanghai various mass organizations,

### Qiao Weiqing's Youngest Son, Changyin, States Living Conditions

His Actions Are Not Questioned by Anyone Other Than His Older Brother

Jia Yaochen Has the Same Surname as His Mother But Is Not His Maternal Uncle

The Dispute Over Guardianship Will Continue to Be Heard

Qiao Weiqing, a wealthy paint merchant, left behind millions in inheritance after his death. Initially, because his children were young, a management committee was organized by relatives and friends to manage the property and supervise the children. Over the years, although Qiao's eldest son, Qiao Changsheng, has reached adulthood and has married and had children, and although his relatives from his hometown of Zhenjiang have come to Shanghai several times to dispute the property and file lawsuits, the committee has never wavered. However, recently, cracks suddenly appeared among the guardians,

Separating into two factions, creating a state of opposition. Subsequently, Hu Weiyun filed a lawsuit with the First Special District District Court against Ren Yian, Na Changsheng, Chang Xiaosong, and others regarding the dispute over guardianship. Qiao's children Changsheng, Changyin, Shuying, and relatives Jia Yaochen, Zhou Shuqing, Xi Qiulianzhu, Fang Zhuhezhen, and Zhu Henian were all recruited by the two factions as important witnesses. The case was previously heard once, and those present resembled a meeting of the Qiao family's relatives. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gui Yu, who is hearing the case, subpoenaed Qiao's

Youngest son Changyin and daughter Shuying to court for interrogation. Only Qiao Changyin appeared in court, stating that he is now eighteen years old and that Shuying is his older sister, now nineteen years old, and that she could not come because she was sick. Only he came to court to await instructions accompanied by an accountant from his home. The court first inquired about his current living conditions, family property, and whom he would like to be his guardian in the future. Changyin then answered in detail, saying that the family's livelihood has always been the responsibility of the management committee, that he is currently studying at home, that his biological mother, Jia, passed away eight or nine years ago,

That his actions are not questioned by anyone other than his older brother Changsheng, that Jia Yaochen is not his maternal uncle, and that because he has the same surname as his mother, he often comes to pester them. Initially, they gave him 40 yuan per month, so the receipts issued by Jia wrote the words "Qiao Mansion generous assistance," which is enough to prove that he is not his maternal uncle. Moreover, his mother never said that Jia was his maternal uncle when she was alive. As for Hu Weiyun, he does not know him at all, so he certainly cannot trust them, and he wishes to be under the guardianship of his older brother Changsheng, and that his sister-in-law

Treats him very well. He also said that he will marry on March 29th, and that his fiancée was chosen by himself, etc. The court then tested his knowledge and then asked about his words and actions at home, whether anyone was surrounding him, and whether what he was saying now was prearranged by others. If so, since he was in court, he did not need to worry and could state the facts truthfully. Changyin replied that what he said was all his own idea, and he presented the receipts of Jia Yaochen's payment to the court. Judge Gui decided to further

Encourage him, saying that young people should establish themselves, practice their skills, and be smart and capable. If their learning and knowledge are insufficient, no matter how rich their family property is, it will not be difficult to squander it all. You should know this. Changyin retreated after being instructed. As for the lawsuit between Hu Weiyun and Ren Yian and others regarding the guardianship of the Qiao family property, it is said that further investigation and trial will continue.

### Case of Plotting to Kidnap Sheng Yupeng; Guide Girl Testifies in Court

Zhang Jinqing Denies Conspiracy

Beggar Provides Details of Writing the Letter

Sentencing Postponed to the 19th

Sheng Ze Cheng (also known as Lao Si), a descendant of the late Qing Dynasty Palace Guardian Sheng Xingsun, lives at No. 75 Yuyuan Road. His nine-year-old son, Yupeng, attends the Western District Primary School of the Shanghai Municipal Council at No. 48 Daxilu Road. On the afternoon of the 20th of last month, at 3:10 PM, Chen Jindu, the son of Sheng's old servant Chen Luo, suddenly had a malicious thought and colluded with a female guide, pretending to be Sheng's family, hired a car and drove to the school, intending to

Lure Yupeng out and kidnap him for ransom. After the incident occurred, Hua Detective Wu Chengmo of the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested Chen Jindu and accomplice Zhang Zhixiong. Based on Chen's confession, they then arrested another accomplice, Zhang Jinqing, at No. 12 Miaolong Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and sent them to the First Special Court, where they were prosecuted by police lawyer Li Zhishan according to law. After the judge interrogated Chen Jindu, he confessed that this matter was done together with Zhang Jinqing, and that the threatening letter was written by

Zhang Zhixiong, but Zhang Jinqing denied it outright. The court hearing was adjourned. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing. Meng Huaquan, a tea servant at the Anshang Hotel, testified that on the 20th of last month, the defendant Chen Jindu came to the room at 10:00 AM alone and said that four people would come in the afternoon to play mahjong. He wrote the name "Shen Bujian," paid the room fee, and then went out. He returned at 2:00 PM and asked me to hire a female guide and call a taxi,

Then they got in the car and left. I did not see Zhang Jinqing, nor was there another car waiting at the door, etc. Then the female guide Shen Sanyuan testified that she was 18 years old. On that day, she was called to the defendant Chen Jindu's room by the tea servant. Chen ordered me to accompany him to the Carde Theater to watch a play. I agreed, and we got in the car together. Unexpectedly, the car drove to the school gate, and he got out and led a child and told him to call me aunt. I said I didn't know him. I don't know anything else. When questioned Chen Jindu,

He still insisted that he colluded with Zhang Jinqing, but Zhang vehemently denied it and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. Zhang Zhixiong, who confessed to being a beggar, said that he met Chen on the road one day and asked him to write a letter. He did not know the stakes, so he wrote several letters according to what he said and was actually used. Judge Fu verified the confession and announced that the debate in this case was over, and the defendants were detained to await sentencing on the 19th.

### Xin Tai Building Incident: Cracking Down on an Opium Den

Den Owner Wang Qisheng Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment

Wang Qisheng, a Cantonese native, had long been in the business of running opium dens. Recently, he established a large-scale opium den in Room 3, Xin Tai Building, No. 36 Sijing Road. The seats were always full and the opium pipes never idle, resulting in a very considerable daily income. This aroused the malicious intent of a group of gangsters, who would gather in droves daily,

demanding money, threatening to report him to the authorities, and disrupting his business. Unable to bear the harassment, Wang discussed with Pan Guixian, the doorkeeper of Xin Tai Building, about finding a better location. After Pan's deliberation, it was decided that Pan would lend Wang a room on the third floor as a place for customers to smoke opium. All the opium paraphernalia was also moved into Pan's room. From then on, it was indeed

possible to avoid the trouble of the gangsters. However, Wang's actions were suddenly discovered by Liu Zhaonian and Li Shugui, Chinese detectives of the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police, along with detectives Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin. They immediately reported to the First Special District Court and obtained a search warrant. On the afternoon of the previous day at 1:30 PM, they rushed to Room 3 of Xin Tai Building to search, but found nothing. After further investigation,

they discovered the secret and then went to Pan's room to search. As expected, they found Chen Yifu from Ningbo and Yin Wanxiang indulging in opium smoking. Consequently, they arrested Wang Qisheng, the opium dealer Liao Chunchao, Pan Guixian, and the two opium smokers Chen and Yin. They confiscated thirty-seven and a half taels of opium, two opium pipes, and six account books.

They were taken back to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court Criminal Division yesterday morning. The defendants retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang for their defense. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi prosecuted them under Articles 5 and 9 of the Anti-Opium Law. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, Wang Qisheng was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan. The remaining defendants were acquitted. The opium paraphernalia and opium were confiscated.

Thieves Use Force to Threaten Vietnamese Constable

Vietnamese Constable Opens Fire, One Injured, Two Escape

The back door of Tian Lu Tea, Food, Candy Store at No. 58 Ganshi East Road in the French Concession is accessible through Lane 62 next door. Yesterday morning at 2:40 AM, three thieves sneaked in through Lane 62 and pried open the back door of Tian Lu Store. They stole a radio receiver, a silver box, and several pieces of clothing. As they were carrying the stolen goods out, a Vietnamese constable, No. 480 of the French Police, happened to pass by the entrance of Lane 62. Hearing noises inside the lane, he went in to investigate. He caught sight of the three thieves carrying stolen goods and trying to flee. The Vietnamese constable stepped forward to arrest them. Unexpectedly, two of the three thieves started attacking him, grabbing the Vietnamese constable by the throat and holding his hands, preventing him from shouting or moving. The other thief drew a small knife, intending to cut the leather strap of the holster containing the constable's pistol, in order to seize the pistol and threaten him. Fortunately, the Vietnamese constable was very strong and struggled fiercely, narrowly averting danger. Seeing that they could not resist, the three thieves fled with the stolen goods. The Vietnamese constable drew his pistol and chased after them, firing seven shots. Two thieves, hearing the gunshots, abandoned the stolen goods and fled. The other thief, Zhang Jinbao (22 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 7, Lian Yi Li, Haining Road), was hit by five bullets, fell wounded outside the back door of No. 15 in Lane 62.

Meanwhile, detectives recovered the stolen goods near the scene of the incident and took them back to the police station. The owner of the store was notified. A police chief dispatched detectives to investigate and arrest the two thieves who had escaped, for interrogation.

### Illegal Engagement

Girl Thirteen, Boy Twenty: Girl's Father Petitions for Invalidity of Engagement

Wang Beishi, a Ningbo native residing at No. 29 Baoyu Fang, Chengdu Road, in the Public Concession, is thirteen years old this year. Her mother has passed away, and her father, Wang Caixiang, age forty-four, is her legal guardian. He, along with retained lawyer Shen Ronghua, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against her fiancé, Cui Yongkang (age twenty, Ningbo native, residing at No. 5 Hong Sheng, No. 4 Tong An Li, Lao Yong An Street), seeking confirmation of the invalidity of the engagement. The court, according to the petition, summoned both parties to the Civil Court Seven yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Wu Xiaoke. Each party arrived with their lawyer. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the plaintiff was engaged to the defendant by her mother when she was eleven years old in the 26th year of the Republic. Now, the plaintiff opposes and disagrees with this engagement, and therefore, in accordance with Articles 972 and 973 of the Civil Code, seeks a judgment confirming the invalidity of the engagement. The defendant's representative, lawyer Xu Lianghao, argued for the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit, stating that the plaintiff's legal guardian was clearly aware that the engagement was illegal at the time. Now that the plaintiff is unwilling to fulfill the engagement, it is not related, and only the defendant's losses need to be compensated, which can be resolved without filing a lawsuit. After the court's review, the parties were instructed to go outside to conduct a settlement. The case was rescheduled for hearing on the 22nd.

The constable on duty, upon hearing the news, quickly reported to the police station and rushed to arrest them first. Unexpectedly, because the lookout robber was hiding in a concealed place, the constable did not notice him. The robber, taking advantage of the constable's unpreparedness, jumped out and punched him in the head, causing a red and swollen lump. The constable lost his balance and almost fell.

Therefore, life is extremely difficult. In Ningxia, Chairman Ma donated 400 yuan, and in Gansu, Chairman Gan donated 600 yuan. The daily routine, except for special circumstances that require changes, is to get up at 6:00 AM every morning, tidy up and do morning exercises, climb mountains or race.

### Random Chat on Pajamas

— Yu Zhenxiong

In ordinary families in our country, pajamas are extremely rare; precisely because they are so few, one could almost say they don't exist at all. When one of your female friends boasts about how many clothes she has, if you were to ask her how many sets of pajamas she owns, that would definitely make her very disappointed and think you are intentionally teasing her! Some don't even know what pajamas are. This is taking women as an example! How many men know about pajamas and own them? But the truth is, those who have studied abroad and admire Westernization, men and women in universities or wealthy families, mostly have a bathrobe, and they treat it as pajamas! But strictly speaking, a bathrobe is a bathrobe, and pajamas are pajamas; even if you have a bathrobe, it's the same as not having pajamas!

So what are pajamas like? Simply put, a short coat and a pair of pants! But their usefulness is not insignificant. Usually, when we go to bed, most men wear a vest and shorts, with the exception of children and middle-aged or older people, and as for women, I'm sorry to say I don't know. In cold weather, they add a short coat and long pants. But this outfit that's added is never a separate set, but the same short shirt and pants worn that day are put on. This is detrimental; first, the clothes easily get dirty and wrinkled, and second, the oily dirt on the collar and cuffs often stains the clean mattress and sheets, which is so disgusting! So if you wear pajamas, all these drawbacks are eliminated! Moreover, the style of pajamas is generally looser and doesn't use buttons, so it doesn't hinder breathing or cause pressure pain on the skin after sleeping, and because you change clothes in the morning and evening, you develop a habit of cleanliness and frequent changing of clothes! For people who kick the covers at night, they won't catch a cold!

The above are just a few points I thought of to mention! There are other special features, which you will experience after wearing them. Now, let me add a word about the material and style of pajamas; towel cloth is the best material, but soft and smooth fabrics are also suitable. Using white satin would be too extravagant and excessive! In the end, softness and maintaining body temperature are paramount. The style is similar to ordinary clothes and pants, the difference being that they are loose and don't use buttons, but use ties to knot instead, so you can adjust the tightness as you like! This is especially good for the stomach, because it's not good to constrict it too tightly when sleeping! I've included two rough sketches, one for men and one for women, for readers' reference. The women's sleeves and waist are narrower, and there is an extra tie at the waist. The cuffs are folded collars, while the men's have no collar for maximum comfort. At first glance, the pants look the same for men and women, but in fact, the women's pant legs should be much narrower, which is very suitable and stylish!

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

In last week's menu, I introduced two fresh seasonal meat dishes for spring. This week, I will introduce one or two fresh seasonal vegetarian dishes, which are not only palatable and filling but also don't violate economic principles. One is wolfberry with stir-fried bamboo shoots. Wolfberry is cooling in nature, and stir-frying it with bamboo shoots creates a unique flavor that surpasses even pea sprouts. However, you must use more sugar and oil; if you put too little, it won't be flavorful. The other is lettuce salad with bamboo shoots, also a wonderful accompaniment to rice or porridge. The bamboo shoots must be steamed first, and the lettuce must be squeezed with salt, then mixed with soy sauce and sesame oil. The method is extremely simple. Don't throw away the lettuce leaves. Stir-fry them with diced bamboo shoots, which is certainly delicious; what's even better is to use them to cook rice, adding some diced meat, diced bamboo shoots, soy sauce, and lard, which is fragrant and rich, ten times better than the vegetable rice sold in the market.

Monday

Chive and shredded pork stir-fry, braised small mandarin fish, wolfberry with stir-fried bamboo shoots, pickled mustard greens with mung bean sprouts

Tuesday

Pickled fish with braised pork, clear stewed knife fish, shrimp roe with gluten, stir-fried garland chrysanthemum

Wednesday

Thousand-layer tofu stewed with pickled fish, chive sprouts with scrambled eggs, lettuce salad with bamboo shoots, braised cabbage

Thursday

Onion beef slices, prawns with braised tofu, Beijing preserved cabbage with bean curd sheets, fried dough sticks in vermicelli soup

Friday

Curry sliced meat, vinegar-glazed yellow croaker, stir-fried soybean sprouts, stir-fried vegetarian delight

Saturday

Stuffed fried tofu, pan-fried sunny-side-up eggs, pickled mustard greens with braised tofu, dried tofu with stir-fried spinach

Sunday

Meat stewed in sauce, fried yellow croaker, stir-fried green vegetables, celery salad

### Shanghai People's Breakfast

— Zhang Zhenshan

Time passes in a cycle from morning to dusk and back again from dusk to morning; people's eating also cycles from breakfast to dinner and back again from dinner to breakfast; however, morning is always considered the beginning of the day's life, and breakfast is the first meal—the nourishment that must be taken before the start of the day's work, just like the principle that oil must be added before a machine starts running, so in the morning, people of all social strata must first fill their stomachs before going to work.

In Shanghai, although there are many types of food, including Sichuan, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Western cuisines, the different tastes are divided into classes by money, from the breakfast in Western restaurants to the scallion pancake stalls at the alley entrances. In between, I really don't know how many levels there are? And I don't know how many ways people eat? In the morning, walking into the large restaurants and tea rooms on Nanjing Road, you'll see that they are full of gentlemen and ladies with delicate appetites, taking a glass of milk and two slices of white toast, or a few chicken buns and duck dumplings, as breakfast. In Western restaurants, naturally, they eat Western-style breakfasts; however, those Chinese people who eat foreign breakfasts know that the taste is not as satisfying as eating a bowl of leftover overnight dishes with porridge at home, but in order to show off and flaunt their wealth, they have to go in and out of Western restaurants, affecting the manners of Westerners.

The next level of people flock to noodle restaurants or snack sections attached to restaurants, a bowl of noodles or a serving of soup dumplings for ten cents can also be taken as breakfast; this kind of breakfast, which is between noble and humble, doesn't cost much money and looks very generous. Although it's not enough compared to the top, it's more than enough compared to the bottom, so it's most welcomed by the salary class who value both economy and face. Those places are always extremely crowded every morning, with no empty seats.

What about the next level of breakfast? It seems to be the porridge and noodles sold at stalls. These stalls are set up on the edges of city streets or near farmers' markets, with a board as a table. Most of the patrons are shop assistants, workers, and vendors, who sit down and feast on the board, stir-fried noodles with pork head meat, mutton porridge, beef, fried tofu, and vermicelli soup, which can also be appropriately arranged according to their appetite. To some of the more noble people, taking this kind of food as breakfast might seem too meager? In fact, you can also say, "Not enough compared to the top, but more than enough compared to the bottom." Those scallion pancake buckets, pancake stalls, soybean milk stalls, baked sweet potatoes, glutinous rice balls... set up at the entrances of various alleys, there are even more people who take these foods as breakfast; the general porters and hawkers, the crowd who exchange labor for life, and the unemployed vagrants, eat with relish, just like the noble people eating Western food, chicken and duck meat noodles, and shrimp dumplings, they are equally able to fill their stomachs, and can equally serve as breakfast—although the price is low and the quality is poor.

Shanghai people's breakfast is thus divided into different quality levels by money!

### Participating in Group Life

— Mao Lie

There are many items in the General Mobilization of the National Spirit program that we need to implement one by one. I believe that all citizens of the Republic of China, under the same belief in resisting the war and building the nation, will certainly be happy to accept them. However, although there are many items, I believe that the most basic first step is for each person to join various groups separately.

Of course, even if everyone doesn't join any group, but only does their own thing, they can still mobilize their own spirit and contribute to the country and nation. However, this will lead to drawbacks: First, the various forces cannot be concentrated, and the efficiency of the forces will inevitably be reduced; second, without mutual supervision, it is easy to generate a sense of slackness; third, those whose spirits are never lifted, or those who intentionally evade, cannot be mobilized together. Therefore, we either don't want general mobilization of the spirit, or if we want to implement general mobilization of the spirit, then everyone must join various groups separately. For example, the citizens in the agricultural sector should join the agricultural branch of the National Spirit General Mobilization Association, those in the industrial sector should join the industrial branch, and so on for the business sector, the education sector, and any other sector. As for those who serve in a certain agency, association, company, or any established group, if the group has a branch organization, they should naturally also join and work together.

Foreigners have always mocked us for not having unity: even Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that we used to be like a plate of loose sand. Since the founding of the Republic of China, although there have been many expressions of unity, and since the War of Resistance, although the loose sand has become a piece of fused strong iron, if we don't constantly strive to improve and temper our unity, it will still be possible to disintegrate at any time, and the strong iron will also tend to corrode, so general mobilization of the spirit is necessary, and the first step is for each person to join various groups. Joining various groups allows us to concentrate our forces. Joining a group is implementing general mobilization of the spirit!

Humans are inherently gregarious animals; those who like to live alone or who are mavericks, although they consider themselves to be aloof and receive praise from some people, are, in reality, violating nature, hindering the progress of civilization, and are ultimately not worth following. Therefore, even in peacetime, everyone should have group life, and now, resisting the war and building the nation is such a great cause, which cannot be done without collective wisdom and effort, and we should take actively participating in group life as the starting point!

I hope: that everyone who has already joined a group will continue to work hard, and those who have not yet joined should go and join the group they consider suitable for themselves at this time.

### The First Night at the Front Line

— Li Qiao

Dragging our bodies, which had been conquered by hunger and fatigue, softly out of the division headquarters, we all thought we could grope our way back, based on the little experience we had when we came. Unexpectedly, we had only walked a short distance from the door when we got lost in the vast, boundless wilderness shrouded in darkness.

Our right front was illuminated by a frightening, red light, and the deep blue sky, dotted with countless sparkling little stars, was also reddened by the intense light. The non-stop firing of guns and cannons was densely mixed together, as if trying to tear apart this world shrouded in darkness. In this deafening and chaotic gunfire, the machine gun fire, which sounded like an elliptical anvil, was very crisp: ta-ta-ta-ta-ta...

"Which way to go?"

"I remember: we passed a ridge when we came, how did we get to these wheat fields? There's not even a road, look, which way to go?"

"Be careful! Don't go to the enemy's defense line, you have to know that this is already on the front line!"

After a brief discussion, everyone decided to return to the division headquarters. Feeling our way in the darkness, we had not walked far when suddenly a messenger came out of the headquarters and led us back to Shila.

We couldn't see anything clearly on the road, so we clustered tightly together and groped our way forward. But our feet were often blocked by something, almost causing us to fall to the ground. Sometimes, our feet would sink into some mud ponds, making it impossible for us to pull them out!

The evening breeze was a bit chilly, blowing in gusts, and the wheat seedlings in the fields were rustling and shaking, as if enemies were walking out of the fields. We walked silently, but kept our eyes wide open and kept watch. The sound of guns and cannons was still lively and loud, and the red light was still so bright and dazzling, like the moment when the sun first comes out.

After passing through the warning line, we finally returned to the small room where we lived. We pushed the door open and went in, and saw that the room was full of more than a dozen comrades, sleeping haphazardly.

"Hey, haven't you eaten yet?""The only female comrade who hadn't fallen asleep, wearing her tweed coat, climbed up from a thin sorghum stalk and greeted us.

"Haven't eaten, have you eaten?"

"Eaten!" She simply answered, and then picked up a basket of cold, dry rice from the table and handed it to us: "Eat quickly! Eat quickly!"

We chewed a mouthful of cold, dry rice, and couldn't swallow it anymore. We looked at her longingly, "Do you have any vegetables?"

"No."

"Do you have any salt?"

"No!"

"Ah..." Everyone couldn't help but laugh.

We devoured a few mouthfuls of rice like wolves, considering it as having eaten. But how to sleep? There were so many people in one place, and there was even a female comrade mixed in...

This female comrade's surname was Tang. It is said that when our troops were stationed in Dean, Jiangxi, she resolutely abandoned her family and school and joined our army. This rare event was then reported extensively in the Jiangxi newspapers. Although other people harbored a kind of disdain towards this young female comrade because of her work ability, I respected her very much. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, out of the 225 million female compatriots in the entire population, how many have sacrificed everything like her to come to the front line? Just from this point alone, I think she is worthy of respect.

"Get up, it's better to rearrange the bedding before sleeping. Otherwise, how can so many people sleep?"

"Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!..." Comrade Tang sang the March of the Volunteers comically, which made the people who were being attacked by sleep laugh involuntarily.

One here, one there, the people who were just about to fall asleep got up unwillingly, and everyone moved the table and the pile of furniture away, and each person busied themselves spreading the prepared gray felt on the ground. Comrade Tang also joined in the lively competition and spread the gray felt on the ground near the door. All the space was covered with gray felt, but I was still holding my gray felt in my hand with no place to put it down.

"Where is my place to sleep?"

"Isn't there still room to sleep next to Comrade Tang?" Everyone looked at me and giggled as if they had done something triumphant.

"There..." I was embarrassed by the laughter, and couldn't help but giggle along with them, the room was filled with the energetic laughter of young people.

Looking at Comrade Tang's uninhibited and frank appearance of sleeping there, I shyly spread the gray felt down. To my surprise, the laughter also disappeared with it. The only thing heard in the room was the intense sound of guns and cannons outside the door...

### Set Off

— Liu Zenghui

### The Lowest Class of People

— Wen Zongshan

The woodpecker specializes in searching for its food in the trees, while the pests residing in the trees are always avoiding its target.

There are always two different types of people standing in opposition in society, which cannot be resolved with emotion, namely, the brave and the lowest class of people.

Late at night, thinking about this small issue, I hope to give me an exceptionally accurate answer to clarify my thoughts.

Today, I found a satisfactory answer and saw the pictographic woodpecker and the corrosive worm. To put it bluntly, the brave and the lowest class of people are staging very vivid and magnificent deeds in opposition.

Penetrating into the temptation of profit, in the abyss of wealth, such a person, a low-class fellow, was killed by the brave man with justice. Some people are surprised, calling this "assassination." I say: It's unremarkable. Many people are willing to do things that "die for gold mining," not to mention that the quickness of this death is directly proportional to the speed of his "going to sea" seeking fame and wealth. You say it's strange, what's strange is that the method of his death is unremarkable, not to everyone's liking. Let's put him to death under the law.

The writing worm can absolutely not escape the woodpecker's sharp beak, you should know; when its sharp beak and tongue curl up the worm, it is the opportunity to tell you the answer.

The lowest class of people will one day be finished by the brave.

### A Song on the Road

— Luo Xi

Wading

Thousands of rivers and streams,

Ten thousand miles of passes and mountains:

Although it is said:——

Everywhere there is also——

The leisurely noon,

The endless long night.

Friends who are used to taking a foreign land as home:

Please don't——

Sigh for the light passing away of the setting sun;

Tomorrow,

Clouds will again obscure the mountains, fog will again obscure the road,

At the moment when the dawn has not yet broken,

Isn't it that you will again want to travel far with light luggage?

Friends, please remember:

The road to light is rugged!

### Mourning the "Strong Man" of Suzhou

— Zhi Ying

Late at night, after drinking, my spirit is much more excited, and everything I usually can't think of surges to my mind; what a great stimulus the sudden news is!

Warrior! You sacrificed yourself fearlessly, calmly and generously, raising your voice and shouting slogans, cursing the shameless traitors. Is your voice more powerful than the explosion of thousands of pounds of bombs? It shook the depths of the hearts of everyone in the dead city. You are so glorious! So valuable! You see your responsibilities so clearly and you have carried them out one by one; I deeply admire you, thank you, and will always remember you and mourn for you. I can't help but sob in the dark, and looking at the horizon, there is endless sorrow, warrior! May you be well!

I know that you have suffered the most cruel pain in the world, shedding drops of blood under the lash, and enduring for one second is enough to make you leave this world. Warrior! Did you endure it? Your flesh was shattered, your blood was exhausted, for the sake of the country.

Sleep well! Warrior! Spring has awakened again, may you live forever: with the azure sky and the verdant rivers and mountains accompanying you, you can sleep well! Your cannon shot has just struck our vanguard, and our brothers are now more active, vowing to follow behind you and shed some hot blood for your motherland. You have left, and there are countless successors. We will all become bombs, exploding one by one, until your motherland is well! What's there to be sad about, throwing away a great man's head like this. The devils and traitors will eventually be annihilated, warrior! You can rest in peace at the foot of Nanyang Mountain!

Written the morning after Feng Xinzhi was assassinated.

### Chatting After

— Editor

Yesterday, the author of "Warrior" was Mr. Gao Xiaochong, "Chong" was mistakenly written as "Zhong", which should be corrected.

### "Eating Arsenic to Kill a Tiger"

— Hua Fu

The world will never run out of clever people. They say: The first is to harm others and benefit oneself: The second is to benefit oneself and benefit others: The third is—no, the third is not allowed—! The third is not to harm oneself or harm others: As for the fourth, harming oneself to benefit others, only the biggest fools in the world would do so, and it is even more unacceptable! In short, clever people have their own unique spirit: They want to live, not die, and even if they have to seek a solution out of desperation, if they can't live well, they should live badly, and they never want to die well. They say that it's better to live badly than to die well, so eating arsenic to kill a tiger becomes the object of their ridicule.

When they encounter a tiger, they will definitely offer it pigs and sheep to satisfy the tiger's appetite. When the pigs and sheep are gone, the tiger stares at them, seemingly wanting to get them and be satisfied, and they will at most hide, and never dare to resist. They say, what a huge thing a tiger is, how dare they touch a hair on its body and invite suffering on themselves. If you look at those who flee, they can only kneel on the ground and beg pitifully, and even when the tiger opens its mouth to swallow them, even if they have arsenic in their hands, they are not willing to stuff it into their own mouths, and hope that they can eventually be "saved from the tiger's mouth." But we can imagine the result of such people, it's nothing more than being a light snack for the tiger, without any feeling.

Perhaps no clever person in the world would see a tiger about to eat him, and actually be so stupid as to do so. However, there are indeed such clever people in the world who see a crisis like a tiger wanting to kill them, unable to escape, unable to fight, and ultimately dare not generously go to death and fight with their lives. They only want to beg, and are indeed doing the "plotting with a tiger for its skin" thing. They say that survival is the first priority; a lose-lose situation is not worth it.

They dream of "co-existence and co-prosperity" with the tiger; they think the tiger also has humanity and can be reasoned with; they even think that even if they are eaten by the tiger, they can still survive in another way! As a ghost, getting the employment of the tiger master. Therefore, they think that their theory is perfect, the facts are thoughtful, and they have long been in an invincible position. As long as they seek peace with the tiger, they can live this way or that way. Only resisting the tiger, in their opinion, is the last resort.

In fact, tigers are often "paper tigers", which, when poked through, reveal their ugly nature. Even if it's not a paper tiger, it's just a "dog-headed tiger", and with its instincts, it will only steal pigs and sheep, and ultimately doesn't have the courage and strength to eat people. As long as people see it, they should strike it head-on - any weapon will do, it doesn't have to be a fast gun. If it is really a golden-eyed, white-browed big insect that will indeed eat people, then we should desperately fight, and if we can't beat it, we should eat arsenic and poison it! Anyway, we're going to die, why not die together with it!

I praise the spirit of eating arsenic to kill a tiger. With this spirit, I think even if the tiger had knowledge, it would retreat three times. Clever people's ridicule is prepared to be ghosts. Since we are not prepared to be ghosts, what do we care about ridicule! With this spirit, we can eradicate the tiger's breath, and we can see the clever people's ridicule fall on their own heads.

### A Northeastern Merchant's Words of Blood and Tears

— Xin Ren

The Recent Situation of the Puppet "Manchukuo" Film Industry Under Iron Heels

Since the fall of the four northeastern provinces and the rise of the puppet regime, which became the fake "Manchukuo," the people have been living a miserable and subhuman existence under oppression. All businesses, especially the film industry, which falls under the cultural sector, have been subject to intensified oppression and exploitation, treating them like beasts of burden. Recently, a merchant from the Northeast, now in Shanghai, spoke of the dire situation there, truly filled with blood and tears! Here, I provide a brief account to reveal the true state of the Northeast film industry under its dark and hopeless conditions.

Film Censorship

Under the leadership of Japanese advisors, the puppet "Manchukuo" film censorship was initially very disorganized, with each province and region conducting its own inspections. This resulted in arbitrary decisions based on personal preferences, lacking any clear standards. Films that were screened in one area were often banned in another. Films that were heavily censored in one place might be shown completely untouched in another. These inexplicable censorship events often left film merchants at a loss, causing them unspeakable suffering. In July 1934, the so-called "Unified Policy for Eastern Film Censorship" was promulgated, placing the administration under the puppet "Ministry of Civil Affairs' Police Department." From that point on, film censorship was considered "unified."

Enslaving Films

Japanese films also had to undergo censorship before being shown in the puppet "Manchukuo." However, this was merely a formality. In reality, Japanese films that could be shown publicly were never subject to any difficulties in the puppet "Manchukuo." Moreover, some of their enslaving films, masquerading as promoting "East Asian peace," often received commendation from the puppet "Ministry of Civil Affairs." However, some Japanese films were simply intended for their own enjoyment.

Grievous Exploitation

Not long ago, a so-called "Film Administration Bureau" was established to manage all film administration within the puppet "Manchukuo." Like other institutions, it was nominally headed by puppet "officials," but the real power was held by Japanese advisors. The "Bureau" implemented strict control over films, requiring all imported films to be handed over for management, and business operations were also to be controlled by them. The "Bureau" took a 40% cut of all business revenue, leaving the film owners with only 60%. This exploitative practice was unreasonably tyrannical. The price for the right to show domestic films in the Northeast, including all expenses, was about four thousand yuan per film. Therefore, the business revenue for each film had to exceed seven thousand yuan to break even. The merchants' profits were all seized, making them no different from beasts of burden.

The Recent State of Domestic Films

As for domestic films shown in the puppet "Manchukuo," they are mostly old, purely entertainment-oriented films from several years ago. Any domestic films with even a hint of national consciousness or contemporary thought would absolutely not be shown there. The puppet "Manchukuo" authorities' prohibition of such films is extremely strict, and film merchants dare not risk engaging in such life-threatening business.

Finally, according to him, he had long given up on such a bestial existence. Although he had been forced to do it for livelihood reasons in the past, he could not help but feel ashamed in his conscience, suffering from intangible condemnation and feeling extremely uneasy. In short, people who have not personally experienced the inhuman life in this dark circle cannot know how miserable it is.

Shameful Events in the Performing Arts World

### Zhao Xiaolan Actually Performs in a Puppet Show

— Ju Shi (Playwright)

Her Motivation for Going South Was Purely an Invitation from the Puppets

What Will the Shanghai Entertainment Circle Think?

Zhao Xiaolan is an indoor disciple of Shang Xiaoyun. She is not a top-tier star, but among female performers in Beijing, she is considered a talented individual. Below the likes of Xue Yanqin and Zhang Eyun, Zhao can also occupy a place. Moreover, Zhao had twice decided to go south, once with Shou Shengzao at the Huangjin Grand Theater, and the second time performing at the Xinyuan Carlton, both times returning north with praise. Recent news has shocked those who appreciate Zhao's artistic talent. It is said that Zhao has recently been singing and dancing in Nanjing, to the "pleasure" of the puppets.

After hearing this news, the writer inquired among members of the Shanghai performing arts world, but they were also unaware of the details. Therefore, I wrote to a friend residing in Beijing, and finally obtained information about the public sentiment regarding Zhao's trip south. I record it to inform the entertainment circle in Shanghai, and even more so, I hope the performing arts world will express their views on this matter.

The puppet government in Nanjing held a so-called ceremony for the "Inaugural Through Train on the Tianjin-Pukou Line." The puppet officials, both big and small, organized a "sightseeing tour" to Nanjing, and accompanying this "sightseeing tour" were several famous performers from Beijing. The leader of the group was Zhao Xiaolan. The troupe, in addition to Zhao and her daughter, consisted of fourteen people, with the list as follows:

Leader: Zhao Xiaolan

Performers: Li Yutai, Yu Lianxian,

Tang Fushun, Sun Laishun,

Zhao Chunjin, Yao Shiqie,

Wang Tianfu, Zhao Rongting,

Chen Dachen, Qian Lin

Musicians: Zhang Liansheng, Song Wenming

Fang Xuanshan, Dong Fengnian

Upon arriving in Nanjing, Zhao Xiaolan and her entourage were "banqueted" by the "Propaganda Bureau of the Reformed Government." Zhao immediately sang during the banquet to add to the "grandeur." That evening, at the invitation of the "Greater People's Association," they broadcast on the "Nanjing Broadcasting" radio station, and it was decided that they would perform at the Central Stage for three nights, starting on the evening of the third day. Prior to this, the "Reformed Government" requested special permission from the Japanese military press department to invite "important officials" from both China and Japan to "appreciate" the performances. On the fourth and fifth days, the "Greater People's Association" would host the performances, offering free admission to citizens from all walks of life. The selected repertoire included "Hongluanxi," "Baihuating," "Chunqiu Pei," "Nü Qijie," "Yutangchun," and "Hongni Guan."

As for Zhao's trip south, her motivation was solely an invitation from the puppets, definitely not for commercial purposes. There was no so-called performance fee. The intermediary contact was Zhang Qingsheng of the "Guidance Department of the New People's Association" in Beijing, who was acting on the orders of his master, the military press department. The "remuneration" for the entire troupe was said to be five thousand gold pieces. With this paltry sum, the famous female performer was blinded by greed, which is also a major event in the performing arts world this year!

### Rare News from the Kunqu Opera World

— Man Fu

Gu Chuanjie to Marry This Month

The famous Kunqu Opera performer Gu Chuanjie, whose real name is Gu Zhicheng, learned his craft at the "Yi Xin Yue Fu" Kunqu Opera Training Institute. Because all students at the training institute had "Chuan" in their name, Gu, who played elegant young men, was known as "Gu Chuanjie," enjoying fame alongside Zhu Chuanming and Zhang Chuanfang. From "Yi Xin Yue Fu" to "Xian Ni She," those who loved Kunqu Opera had a deep impression of Gu's acting. Later, he suddenly abandoned acting and pursued an official career, studying at Soochow University and Guanghua University's affiliated middle schools in Suzhou. He then went to Nanjing Jinling University to study agriculture. After graduating, he worked in rural areas in Zhenjiang for a while. After the war, he finally came to Shanghai. Occasionally, at the request of friends, he returned to the stage, but only as a guest performer. Through the introduction of Yan Weiyu and Hu Shanyuan, the editor of this newspaper's "Zi Shan Tan," he became engaged to the famous Kunqu Opera amateur Zhang Yuanhe (the granddaughter of Zhang Shushen, the former Qing Dynasty Governor of Suzhou) on February 3rd at the Zhongshe. Yesterday, joyous news came that Gu and Zhang's happy event was near, and they are scheduled to marry on the 21st of this month at the Atlantic Restaurant on the Fourth Road, celebrating their marital bliss. "Lan Huamei" (Lazy Eyebrows) will happily "Bang Zhuangtai" (Adorn the Dressing Table), "Neng Feng Chengxiang" (Auspicious Phoenix), "Jiaqi" (Happy Marriage), "Dai Chan" (Expecting a Child), and "Yu Qilin" (Jade Kylin). It is said that the members of the Xian Ni She will organize a Beijing Opera and Kunqu Opera performance that day.

Xian Ni She Finds a Venue

Since Xian Ni She Kunqu Opera performed at the Oriental Hotel last year, it has been praised by Kunqu Opera lovers. Later, due to the expiration of the contract, they moved to the Xian Le Grand Theater in western Shanghai. Recently, their performances were interrupted due to scheduling issues. The person in charge of the troupe has now successfully negotiated with the Great China Bookstore attached to the Great China Hotel on Fuzhou Road, and a contract has been signed. They will soon be able to perform on stage, with two shows a day and night. This is specially noted to inform those who love Kunqu Opera.

### Silver Screen News

— Qin Tian

Wang Yuanlong's directed film "Yanzi Li San" has now been renamed "Yanzi Thief" and will be next on the set after "Three-Volume Incarnation Girl."

The film adaptation of "Wang Zhaojun" was originally proposed by Xinhua Company long ago, and Li Minghui was designated as the lead actress at that time. Now that it is about to be produced, the lead actress has been changed to Chen Yanyan.

The Yi Hua Company's "Chu Overlord" has been a huge box office success in Hong Kong. It is said that recently there are still four theaters showing it simultaneously, with each theater selling over a thousand yuan worth of tickets every day.

Diao Banhua, who has been away from the silver screen for a long time, will soon shoot a new film, "Four Demon Kings."

The first shot of "Mysterious Lady" is an audition for a flower vase, and the first shot of "Three-Volume Incarnation Girl" is a pair of live treasures—Han Langen and Guan Hongda bedridden.

Chen Kangran has decided to direct "Women's Apartment" after "Film City Notes."

The famous amateur performer Wang Huigu recently made a guest appearance as Su Qiu in "Mysterious Lady." Her initial screen test was surprisingly successful. It is said that if she is not a genius, how could she achieve this? It is hoped that she will do well.

### Corrigenda

Yesterday, the article about the relief effort mistakenly stated that it was initiated by the International Red Cross. It was actually initiated by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Trade Association.

The statement that Huang Guiqiu will perform at the Huangjin Grand Theater is incorrect, according to a statement from the theater.

In the Yiyou Cup Championship, sponsored by the Yiyou Society, the Yiyou team and the Puying team played their final match the night before last. The Puying team, riding high on their previous victories, fought bravely. The Yiyou team, facing a formidable opponent, also calmly fought back. The match was full of exciting moments, attracting a large and surprised audience. The fierce battle between Huang Jingen and He Xiaojie was the most intense. Unfortunately, the Yiyou team was weakened by the absence of their general, Chuan Gaoshun, and ultimately lost by a score of 9 to 19. The Puying team thus won the first Yiyou Cup championship.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Performing Arts World of the Former Capital (144)

A Strange Wind Helped Li Zhuangyuan During the Palace Examination

At this time, Li Pan remained unconscious. When he was called for the third time, even after shouting his name twice, he did not respond and continued to kneel in front of the hall in a daze. Until the third time he was called, two eunuchs suddenly supported him and led him away, as if he was dreaming, and he obtained the top spot in the imperial examination. But strangely, after Li Pan was shielded by the screens, he immediately wrote non-stop, completing the paper in an instant. When he submitted it, his writing was also the best. This was truly a strange wind that helped him.

When Li Pan was the chief examiner, the successful candidates under him, such as Nian Gengyao and Altai, all became high-ranking officials and prominent figures. When he celebrated his birthday in his later years, others wrote poems praising him, including the flattering line "Half of the officials are from your students," which shows his influence at the time. During the Yongzheng era, his close friend Li Wei rose to the position of prime minister, so the Li family's power in the early Qing Dynasty was astonishing. Li Houji, who served as the governor of Fujian after the Republic, was a direct descendant of Li Wei. From Mr. Li Xiangyang to the present, the Li family can be considered a prominent family for three generations: Ming, Qing, and Republican. Back then, Mr. Xiangyang was certain to become the top candidate, but he declined. However, in his third generation, not only did another top candidate emerge, but also a prime minister. If Mr. Li had not been famous throughout the world and his personality and knowledge were universally respected, the Manchu slaves would never have so favored his descendants. In the past, during the imperial examination era, the three generations of the examinee had to be presented first. The Qing court, awed by Mr. Xiangyang's great name, knowing that he was a man of integrity and good family education, reluctantly appointed Li Pan as the top candidate. However, I feel sorry for Li Pan because he did not inherit his grandfather's great ambition and did not use his position and prestige at the time to rally the patriots who wanted to restore the Ming Dynasty, in order to complete the unfinished great cause of Mr. Xiangyang. He missed a great opportunity. Moreover, at that time, it could be said that eighty or ninety percent of the Manchu slaves' military and political power was in his hands. As I said before, "Nian Gengyao's teacher" was extremely rare in ancient and modern times. If Li Pan could have explained the righteousness and the ambition of expelling the Manchus and restoring the Ming Dynasty, I think that General Nian, who was born in the revolutionary Guangdong Guangning County, would have been moved by it. At that time, he held hundreds of thousands of troops, and the political power was also in the hands of Li Pan's cousin Li Wei. After a prime minister and a commander-in-chief both agreed, Li Pan could raise the banner of his grandfather Xiangyang, and it would probably only take a moment to drive the Manchu slaves out of the country. Unfortunately, Li Zhuangyuan did not think of this and was just like the bureaucrats with individualism, enjoying his life and considering it done. In this way, even though he became the top candidate, I think Mr. Xiangyang would have been filled with regret in the afterlife.
