### Yesterday, a Large Number of Japanese Planes Again Bombed Chongqing; Rumors Say Two Were Shot Down by the Chinese Air Force; Areas from Central Park to the East of the City Were Affected; The Banking District Was Also Hit, Causing a Large Fire; Casualties Are Unknown; Another Sixty-Six Planes in Five Groups Bombed Southern Guangdong

(Chongqing) The Japanese planes attacking Chongqing on the 25th were divided into three groups. The first group of twenty-seven planes sneaked into the city around 7:00 AM, dropping over a hundred bombs. They were fiercely attacked head-on by Chinese planes, and one was shot down. Another was also hit and crashed. The second group of six planes approached the urban area around 7:30 AM. The Chinese anti-aircraft fire was intense, so they dared not intrude, and aimlessly dropped bombs in the suburbs of the city before fleeing. The third group of six planes approached the urban area around 8:00 AM. Because of the well-executed Chinese lighting control, they could not find their target. After circling for a long time, they flew east with their bombs. After the Japanese planes flew far away, the alarm was lifted at 9:35 AM. (Dispatch of the 25th)

(Chongqing) Tonight, twenty-six Japanese planes dropped over one hundred bombs in an area approximately a quarter of a mile wide and half a mile long in the business center of Chongqing. The Japanese planes encountered six Chinese fighter planes over the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River. Fierce fighting broke out. The Japanese planes heavily bombed the area along the riverbank to Central Park, engaging in destruction. Although the number of Chinese planes was smaller than that of the Japanese planes, they still fought fiercely, repeatedly "diving" and "rising" among the Japanese planes in an attempt to drive them back. Although the Chinese planes' attempt to prevent the Japanese planes from bombing was not entirely successful, according to a Chinese report, two Japanese planes were shot down at the time. Many of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes in the riverbank area fell into the river, hitting many ships parked along the river. For a time, blood and flesh flew across the river, a horrific sight. Dozens of bodies, along with broken wood and wrecked ships, floated on the water. It is also reported that the worst-hit area was Central Park, which was hit by five bombs. At least one hundred people were killed, and the number of injured was roughly the same as the number of dead. One bomb fell in the park's zoo, killing hundreds of birds and monkeys. Another bomb hit an air-raid shelter, causing it to collapse, killing dozens of people who were taking shelter inside. Several hundred trees and many pagoda-style buildings were also destroyed. Twenty people who were lined up under a stone wall to avoid the bombs were all killed by shrapnel. The office of the famous German company, Carlowitz & Co., was also destroyed. Dr. Berthold, a German doctor, was slightly injured during the Japanese bombing of Chongqing on May 5. This time, his residence was also destroyed. A bomb hit the Canadian Church Hospital, but fortunately, no one was injured. Another six bombs fell near the Canadian Church and the Foreign Churches Association, destroying many houses, but none of the foreign church buildings were hit by bombs. The city's largest Buddhist temple was also destroyed. The "Transportation of Wounded Soldiers Headquarters" run by foreigners was also hit by a bomb, suffering heavy losses. The city was shrouded in thick smoke for half an hour. Thousands of frightened refugees ran in all directions to take shelter, and many were injured by bombs while searching for shelter. Several bombs also hit the area previously bombed by Japanese planes, killing many soldiers defending the area. A firecracker factory was hit by a bomb, causing a huge explosion. People suspected that an ammunition depot had been hit. Several large fires broke out in the city. Firefighters were unable to immediately go to put them out because the roads were full of broken walls and rubble. The authorities ordered hundreds of workers to clear the roads for the firefighters. Rescue workers went to the bombed areas to rescue the injured, who were immediately taken to various hospitals for treatment. The air in the city was filled with the smell of "black powder." According to military authorities, the Japanese were apparently using old-fashioned bombs due to a shortage of cotton. Many residents fled to the entrance of the Mei Feng Bank (transliteration) to take shelter, but a bomb hit the bank, killing the people taking shelter there. The tops of the Yanye Bank and the Chongqing Bank were also destroyed. The city's electricity and telephone lines were cut off. In several places on the streets, debris was piled up to a height of twenty feet. Two fires broke out in the business district, spreading widely, but firefighters were able to arrive and extinguish them. The fires that broke out in various places were not allowed to spread, and all were able to be extinguished because the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes were mostly demolition bombs. (American Associated Press dispatch of the 25th)

(Chongqing) Japanese planes on the 3rd, 4th, and 12th of this month, three times indiscriminately bombed the urban area of Chongqing. The bloodstains of the victims had not yet dried, and on the 25th, they attacked Chongqing again, carrying out a brutal bombing of innocent civilians in the Chinese rear. The Air Defense Command issued air raid emergency alerts around 6:00 PM and 6:30 PM. In an instant, twenty-four Japanese planes, in a figure-eight formation, circled over the repeatedly bombed urban area, frequently dropping more than one hundred bombs. Dozens of civilian residences in the urban area were destroyed, and many civilians were killed and injured. After being fiercely attacked head-on by the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery, they fled east after dropping their bombs. The newly appointed Mayor of Chongqing, He Guoguang, immediately led his subordinates to inspect the bombed areas before the alert was lifted. The Central Service Corps Air Raid Emergency Relief Joint Office and service personnel also mobilized fully to carry out rescue work. Soldiers from a certain army were also responsible for clearing the streets. The situation was tense. (Dispatch of the 25th)

(Chongqing) The densely populated lower city of Chongqing was bombed on the 3rd of this month. It was again heavily bombed by Japanese planes. As many as twenty-seven Japanese planes attacked, affecting areas from Central Park to the eastern part of the city. The Chongqing Bank was also hit. Multiple bombs landed near the Mei Feng Bank, the Sichuan Yanye Bank, and Central Park, causing large fires to break out. The number of dead and injured is still unknown. It is rumored that anti-aircraft artillery shot down two Japanese planes, but this has not yet been confirmed by officials. The alert began at 6:15 PM, when bombers were seen heading upstream. At exactly 7:00 PM, the sound of bombs and anti-aircraft artillery firing was heard simultaneously, and the intense bombing began. Immediately, rescue teams, stretcher teams, and many female service members and nurses bravely rushed to the bombed areas. Fire brigades also rushed to the fire locations to extinguish the blazes. They began to retreat gradually after the alert was lifted. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

Lian County: Sixty-six Japanese planes, on the morning of the 25th around 6:00 AM, in five groups, attacked Shaoguan, Wengyuan, Yingde, and other places.

(Chongqing) Today in Chongqing, thousands of workers and soldiers are working up to sixteen hours a day, striving to clear away all debris and demolish houses (several hundred have already been demolished) in order to build firebreaks to prevent Japanese air force bombings. All houses that are demolished, regardless of who they belong to or how old they are, must be demolished if they are within the designated area. The planned firebreaks are fourteen meters wide. Workers strictly adhere to this directive, and all firebreaks opened are fourteen meters wide. Therefore, there are often many houses that are half demolished and the other half still standing. Yesterday, the Chongqing Municipal Government ordered workers to stop work at night (from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM) for fear that the work of bombing houses with machinery would cause misunderstandings among residents.

Editorial

### Wang Jingwei's Peace Movement Theory

Rumors about Wang Jingwei's arrival in Shanghai are frequent, and the speakers are definite. There are different kinds of people: some are for a family, some are for a generation, some are for a moment, and some are for ten thousand years. However, there is no one who transcends his time and abandons his time, or transcends his country and abandons his country. Wang Jingwei, in China, is considered one of the rebellious officials and traitors. He loves wealth and fame, and uses treachery to rise above others. His governance is not enough to be effective, and his rebellion is not enough to destroy the country. Therefore, his arrival in Shanghai is not worthy of our attention, and we do not count him. But yesterday's Hong Kong dispatch said:

"The Japanese side is still attempting to end the war as soon as possible. After the failure of the so-called Peace and National Salvation Association organized several months ago, there is a new plan to have Wang Jingwei launch and organize a World Peace and Cessation of War Movement. Its purpose is to call for world peace, strive for Sino-Japanese friendship, and thereby induce the masses to end the war as soon as possible. It is heard that the general association will be set up in Shanghai, with Wang as the chairman, and branch associations will be set up in Beiping and Tianjin. Jiang Chaozong is designated as the chairman of the Beiping branch, and Jin Yunpeng is designated as the chairman of the Tianjin branch. The use of the word "world" is to prepare for the Japanese side to also make a similar organization when necessary to echo each other. A certain German named Hong, who used to be a professor at Peking University, has also agreed to join. In addition, it will encourage people from various countries in Beiping to participate. The expenses of the association will be entirely provided by the Japanese side, and it is expected to be established next month."

If the dispatch is true, Wang is stubbornly unrepentant; or a mean petty man is inherently prone to perverse behavior.

In general countries, in the event of war, blind obedience is the principle, and praising the war is the urgent task; China is different. It deeply detests and abhors war, and only goes to war because it has no choice. Precisely because of this difference, when examining public opinion, the roughly the same conclusion is: We do not like war, we do not want war; but how can we maintain an independent and autonomous country without war? Without war, there is no way to maintain it, so we have no choice but to go to war. Wang Jingwei cannot shake this conclusion by advocating anti-war and peace. He is not invoking the name of the country but fundamentally ignoring independence and autonomy. It is appropriate that he is not tolerated by reason. He harbors ulterior motives, and his anger makes him lose his mind. Empty-handed, running around, leading people astray, working hard and accomplishing nothing, he is pitiful and unworthy of pity.

Moreover, as the Hong Kong dispatch says, we will not only assert that Wang Jingwei will ultimately not succeed, but we deeply doubt that the Hong Kong dispatch is fundamentally untrustworthy. Why? It is said that the Japanese side is still attempting to end the war as soon as possible, which is due to circumstances. However, it is said that figures such as Hiranuma and Konoe cannot extricate themselves and will rely on Wang Jingwei, which is untrustworthy, firstly. The diagnosis of the League of Nations also recognizes China as an invaded country. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese war is a war of aggression and anti-aggression. In other words, the key to whether to fight or not is whether there is aggression or not, and the key to whether to make peace or not is Japan, which launched the aggression. The key is not in China, so why organize a Peace and Cessation of War Association in China? This is untrustworthy, secondly. It is said that they only hope that China will make peace, which is tantamount to urging Japan to continue its aggression and expecting China not to resist. China has its reasons to resist, but Japan has no reason to invade. Therefore, seeking peace under aggression can only be achieved with absolute superiority and sustainable military, material, and spiritual strength. How can Wang Jingwei, who has two or three hearts, succeed in this movement? This is the third reason. The world condemns Japan, but Japan does not know how to change its course. How can it deceive the world with fallacies and sophistry? Therefore, the name "world" should be an unreliable fabrication. This is the fourth reason. The Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession have jointly issued notices to ban political activities and political gatherings within the concessions. Therefore, Wang Jingwei's chairmanship and the establishment of the general association in Shanghai will undoubtedly be prohibited by the concessions. It is said that they will not affect the public order and will be given a "special note of recognition." This is absolutely untrustworthy. This is the fifth reason. Although Japan is seeking a quick victory, in order to reluctantly maintain its public sentiment and morale, it considers the anti-war movement in its own country as treason. Therefore, it is said that the Japanese side can also make a similar organization when necessary to advocate the so-called peace and cessation of war, which Japan would never dare to do. This is the sixth reason. After Wang Jingwei defected from Chongqing, whether the international community ignores him or proves by facts and actions that he supports China's resistance to Japan, Chinese public opinion condemns Wang Jingwei. Therefore, Wang's ambition is greater than his ability to rally support, and he is not worth the support and promotion of the Japanese side. Is it appropriate for the Japanese side to see this clearly and still cherish this broken broom, hoping for it to be useful? This is the seventh reason. All of these reasons make us unable to believe the rumors about Wang Jingwei transmitted in the Hong Kong dispatch. Since half a year ago, and from now on, Wang Jingwei has fundamentally destroyed his position. Measured by historical value, he is not as good as Li Chuang and Wu Sangui because he is "not enough to destroy the country."

### The League of Nations Plans to Pass a Resolution Asking Member States to Individually Aid China; Rejecting China's Request to Sanction Japan

(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council meeting will end today or tomorrow by passing a resolution calling on member states to increase the assistance they can individually give to China, which is tantamount to rejecting China's request to sanction Japan and approving its proposal regarding gasoline supplies. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council held a closed-door meeting today and passed a resolution drafted by the League of Nations Committee on Chinese Affairs. The resolution invites member states to increase any assistance they can individually give to China and recommends that diplomatic representatives of member states investigate and report on the bombing of Chinese civilians. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)

(Geneva) Regarding China's application concerning the Sino-Japanese dispute, the League of Nations Executive Council will pass two resolutions tomorrow to conclude the discussion of this regular session. Both drafts have been completed, and the Chinese representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, has also expressed his acceptance. One is very similar to the one already passed by the Executive Council regular session in January of this year, which is to recommend to member states to individually assist China as much as possible. The second condemns the bombing of ordinary Chinese people by Japanese aircraft and asks member states and non-member states to notify the League of Nations Executive Council in the future if they are aware of such bombing incidents. According to the Chinese representative's application, the Executive Council should send an investigation team to conduct on-site investigations. Although this level has not been adopted, according to the method now decided by the Executive Council, diplomatic officials and observers stationed in China from various countries can come out and cooperate. The result can still satisfy China's wishes. In addition, all resolutions should mention the Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee, which was established by the League of Nations General Assembly in 1937, including representatives from 23 countries. The United States also sent a representative to attend. When necessary, it may be convened. (Havas dispatch of the 24th)

### The Situation on Kulangsu Becomes Serious Again: Japanese Side Claims the Possibility of Japanese Troops Landing; Asahi Shimbun Reiterates Demand to Manage Concessions

(Tokyo) Rear Admiral Kanazawa, spokesperson for the Japanese Navy Ministry, stated today, based on information from Kulangsu, that the landing of marines by Britain, the United States, and France on Kulangsu has made the situation increasingly serious and has undermined the original intention of restoring peace and order on the island. The landing of foreign troops has resulted in three major repercussions: the situation on Kulangsu is now worse than when Japanese troops were maintaining peace and order. First, there has been a sudden change in the attitude of the Kulangsu Municipal Council. The Municipal Council had previously been quite moderate and cooperated with the Japanese authorities, but after the foreign troops landed, the Municipal Council immediately changed its attitude, becoming unwelcoming to cooperation and even refusing to cooperate with the Japanese side. Second, anti-Japanese agitation has intensified. Anti-Japanese leaflets are now appearing everywhere in the concession. Third, the frequent traffic of ships between Kulangsu and the mainland provides opportunities for anti-Japanese elements to infiltrate the concession. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the Japanese naval authorities will have no choice but to send more marines to Kulangsu. The Japanese authorities aim to make the Kulangsu International Settlement a place where foreign residents can live in peace, and they cannot allow the current situation on the island to continue. Kulangsu is a small island whose happiness and prosperity depend entirely on Xiamen, but it has now become a base for anti-Japanese activities disrupting peace and order in Xiamen. The Japanese side prohibits Chinese civilian ships from traveling between Kulangsu and the mainland in order to prevent anti-Japanese elements from infiltrating the concession. The Japanese authorities have no intention of harming foreigners. Even if civilian ships are suspended, foreigners can still obtain their daily necessities from Xiamen. There are only two hundred and thirty Japanese residents on Kulangsu, but more than twenty thousand in Xiamen. Many Japanese people work in Xiamen, but they reside on Kulangsu, it is said. An American reporter claimed that the withdrawal of Japanese residents from Kulangsu would improve the situation there. Kanazawa refuted this, saying that there are fewer foreign residents than Japanese residents, and that the situation would certainly improve if foreign residents withdrew. (Reuters, 25th)

(Tokyo) According to a Japanese naval spokesperson, given the current serious situation on Kulangsu, there is a high possibility that the Japanese navy will re-land troops. It is claimed that the situation has deteriorated further since the navies of the United States, Britain, and France landed on Kulangsu. At the same time, the Municipal Council there is again showing a lack of willingness to cooperate with the Japanese side. Japanese newspapers here are strongly attacking Britain and France for their unwillingness to withdraw their marines from Kulangsu. Although the United States opposes Japanese actions on Kulangsu that harm foreign interests just as strongly as Britain and France, Japanese newspapers are avoiding making accusatory remarks against it. Many Japanese newspapers say that if the Kulangsu Municipal Council does not yield to Japanese demands, Japan will inevitably take drastic measures. According to Japanese sources, since the Kulangsu Municipal Council felt that it had obtained British and French assistance, it has appeared to turn a blind eye to anti-Japanese activities, leading to a significant increase in such activities. The Asahi Shimbun claims that the reason Britain and France are protecting concessions in various parts of China is "solely to support the rule of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek." The newspaper concluded by reiterating Japan's demand to manage concessions in various places. It is heard that the Japanese side will adopt "drastic measures," and that the Shanghai International Settlement is also included. (Associated Press, 25th)

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese sources from Xiamen, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, Uchida, has requested the Chairman of the Kulangsu Municipal Council to explain the public notice issued by the Municipal Council on May 19 after the landing of British, American, and French sailors. The Chairman of the Municipal Council has not yet replied. It is noted that this public notice contains the phrase that foreign sailors have landed at the request of the consuls of the countries concerned to stop illegal activities in the concession. The Japanese Consul-General believes that this phrase gives the impression that the Japanese sailors are the ones committing illegal acts and declares that the Japanese authorities attach great importance to this implication and therefore request an explanation. (Reuters, 25th)

(Tokyo) According to the English-language Guang Zhi Bao, the spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated yesterday during a reception for newspaper reporters that foreign settlements and concessions in China are merely administrative restrictions on Chinese sovereignty and are therefore not foreign territory. Japan, in a state tantamount to war, is currently engaged in activities in China, staking the fate of the nation. The purpose of its actions in China is to place Chinese sovereignty under Japanese control. In light of this situation, it should be recognized that Japan will place all of China's land under Japanese control. (Reuters, 25th)

(Tokyo) The spokesperson for the Japanese Navy announced today that if the situation on Kulangsu becomes more serious, Japan will send additional marines to the area. It is claimed that the situation has become more tense since the navies of Britain, France, and the United States landed on Kulangsu. The authorities of the International Settlement have changed their attitude of being willing to compromise with Japan, and anti-Japanese activities within the International Settlement have also increased dramatically compared to before. Although there are only one hundred and fifty Japanese people currently residing on Kulangsu, there are more than twenty thousand in Xiamen, and the safety of the Japanese people must also be taken into account.

### The Case of the "Rangpura" Mail Steamer: Britain Lodges a Strong Protest; Denies Military Mailbags Were Seized; Sends Warships to Protect Transport Vessels

(Hong Kong) According to official claims, regarding the incident of the mail steamer "Rangpura," Admiral Sir Percy Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, has recently lodged a very strong protest. (Reuters, 25th)

(London) It is widely rumored here that regarding the Japanese warship's interception of the British mail steamer "Rangpura" near Hong Kong yesterday morning, Admiral Sir Percy Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, has issued a strong protest today, requesting that Japan adopt concrete plans to prevent the possibility of such incidents recurring in the future. It is heard that the protest states that the previously agreed-upon procedure for verifying flags only allows boarding inspections of ships flying the British flag whose nationality is questionable. However, the mail steamer "Rangpura" has been traveling between Japanese and British ports for many years, and there can be no doubt about its nationality. Therefore, it is requested that the reasons for the Japanese warship's interception of the ship be explained, and that concrete plans be adopted to prevent the possibility of such incidents recurring. (Reuters, 25th)

(Hong Kong) Regarding the Japanese military's inspection of the British India Steam Navigation Company mail steamer "Rangpura," Admiral Sir Percy Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, has lodged a serious protest with the naval authorities in Xiamen, which has been forwarded to Tokyo. The protest strongly opposes the Japanese navy's firing two shots across the bow of the "Rangpura" one mile from Hong Kong's territorial waters, as well as Japanese sailors boarding a neutral passenger ship and insisting on inspecting the ship's log. (Associated Press, 25th)

(London) Regarding the inspection of the British mail steamer "Rangpura" by a Japanese warship near Hong Kong yesterday, responsible sources here have stated that Vice-Admiral Sir Percy Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese naval authorities. The protest stated that Britain and Japan had previously agreed that any merchant ship flying the British flag could only be inspected if there was doubt about its nationality. As for the "Rangpura," it has been sailing in Chinese waters for many years, and the British India Steam Navigation Company to which it belongs is a world-renowned shipping company, leaving no room for doubt. What is the reason for this abrupt inspection? The Japanese naval authorities should be asked to clearly explain this and take concrete measures to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. (Havas News Agency, 25th)

(Hong Kong) British naval authorities today strongly deny the news that the Japanese navy took away several British military mailbags when it left the British India Steam Navigation Company mail steamer "Rangpura" yesterday. The news is described as "meaningless." British naval circles cannot confirm news about British warships protecting British ships sailing along the Chinese coast, but well-informed sources believe the news to be accurate. (Associated Press, 25th)

(London) According to reports received here, Admiral Sir Percy Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai regarding the search of the British mail steamer "Rangpura" by a Japanese warship. The "Rangpura" is a giant ship of sixteen thousand tons, carrying two hundred passengers. Yesterday, it was ordered to stop sailing near Hong Kong by a Japanese warship, and Japanese officials boarded the ship to inspect the passengers' passports. Admiral Sir Percy Noble stated in the protest that normally only foreign ships suspected of carrying munitions are subject to inspection and expressed the hope that the Japanese naval authorities would guarantee that such incidents would not occur again in the future.

### Yangtze River Navigation Repeatedly Obstructed: Britain Makes Representations to Japan; British Parliament Concerned About the Situation in the Far East; Urges Government to Take Decisive Action

(London) During the meeting of Parliament this afternoon, Conservative MP Milner asked, "On May 2nd, two thousand head of fresh pork in Xingang, China, were being transferred by sampan to the British ships 'Huangpu' and 'Christian Moller' when they were suddenly seized by five Japanese armed motorboats and forced to be taken to nearby Japanese ships. How has the British government responded to this incident, and has it taken various measures to prevent further interference with British shipping on the Yangtze River?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately provided a written response, stating, "The Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, is unaware of the incident described by Mr. Milner, but he will soon receive a report and learn that British commercial shipping in the Yangtze River Delta has recently been interfered with and that this interference has intensified. Therefore, representations have been made to the Japanese government." (Havas News Agency, 24th)

(London) The members of the China Subcommittee of the Conservative Party Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting tonight, expressing pleasure at the decisive action taken on Kulangsu and hoping that similar decisive action would be taken in similar situations anywhere. The subcommittee considered the general situation in China, acknowledging that the situation regarding the British concession in Tianjin, the obstruction of navigation on the Yangtze River, the landing of Japanese troops on Kulangsu, and the repeated threats of Japanese actions in China is serious. The members are fully aware of the seriousness of the situation, will continue to closely monitor events, and will use all their influence to represent British interests in China. (Reuters, 24th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today in response to a question that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had received informal information stating that in March, several Japanese ships and one German ship had departed from Qingdao carrying goods directly to Europe and North America, but he did not mention British or American ships. The Foreign Secretary has not yet received official confirmation of the news. The Prime Minister also stated that the proportion of goods transported to Europe by British ships from Qingdao in 1935 and 1936 accounted for 36.62% of the total, but the tonnage of goods carried in 1936 was slightly lower than in 1935.

### China's Determination to Resist is Strong: It Will Certainly Achieve Final Victory; Switching from Defense to Offense Keeps Japan Busy Running Around: Ambassador Hu Shih Discusses the War Situation in the United States

(Washington) The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shih, stated to reporters today that China may need to continue resisting for another two years before it can achieve final victory. He further pointed out that China is still very united and that its determination to resist is still very strong, which is particularly exciting. He also said that China launched a counteroffensive on a two-thousand-mile-long front last month after two years of resistance. Due to the Chinese army's counteroffensive, the Japanese side had to be on the defensive. This "April Counteroffensive" was actually intended to test the strength of the Japanese army on an expanded front. As a result, the Japanese army stopped advancing on all fronts. This counteroffensive caused a total of five hundred and four major and minor battles. As a result of the Chinese side's use of guerrilla tactics to launch a large-scale offensive against the Japanese side in April and May, Japan's lines of communication have been cut, and Japan's difficulties have gradually increased. He further pointed out that seven months after occupying Guangzhou, the Japanese army still cannot control the area around Guangzhou. They (the Japanese army) have similar difficulties near Hankou. In fact, only a small part of China's vast territory has been occupied and managed by the Japanese army. He also cited the fact that the Chinese government is still collecting taxes a few miles near Shanghai to prove his point. He said that the most difficult period China encountered was when Guangzhou and Hankou fell at the end of last year, but China still managed to get through it safely. This is the best guarantee that resistance to Japanese aggression will continue for a long time. (Associated Press, 25th)

### The Success of the Literary Revolution: A Factor in China's Rebirth

(Washington) The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, stated in a speech at the annual meeting of the Columbia University Club tonight that China's restoration is closely related to Columbia University. It is understood that many important government figures attended this annual meeting. According to Dr. Hu Shih, the idea of reforming the Chinese script originated at Columbia University in 1916. This ideal was successfully realized a few years later and became one of the important factors in China's rebirth. Hu Shih was the leader of this movement. He entered Columbia University in 1915 and devoted himself to reforming the Chinese script in the following two years, creating the foundation for vernacular Chinese. He also initiated the writing of poetry in the vernacular. His essay "Tentative Proposals for the Improvement of Chinese Literature" was the first declaration of the "Chinese Literary Revolution."

### Japanese Controlled Shipping Plans: Applicable to Coastal Routes

(Tokyo) According to the plan set by the Autonomous Council for Shipping Control, ships operating on international routes will not be subject to shipping control. The reason for this is to maintain and expand Japan's authority in international shipping and to attract foreign currency, hence this decision. However, ships operating on coastal routes will be subject to control to meet the needs of raw material mobilization and capacity expansion plans. It is heard that the owners of various shipping companies exchanged views at a special meeting of the Shipping Control Council yesterday and have agreed in principle to the establishment of a new Japanese shipping control system. Private representatives familiar with shipping and officials from the Ministries of the Navy, Army, and Commerce will all participate in the newly established shipping control system. (Reuters, 25th)

(Tokyo) A conference will be held here from June 20 to discuss the unified transportation plan between Japan and "Manchukuo." A total of eighty-eight delegates will participate, and it will last for a week. (Reuters, 25th)

### Japan's Expansion of Power: The Netherlands Feels Threatened; There is a Need to Strengthen Defenses

The Hague: Professor Lohman, leader of the Christian Historical Party, stated in the House today that, given the current expansion of the Japanese navy, the Dutch East Indies fleet must increase by three warships. Strengthening the strength of the Dutch East Indies is also very important for Australia. Today, the British pay ten pounds per person in taxes for national defense, while the Dutch only pay one-fifth of that amount, so their strength is not enough to pay more, he said. (Reuters, 24th)

### Belgium and the Netherlands Should Unite: To Resist Tyranny Together; The Queen of the Netherlands is in Beijing: Encouraging Each Other with this

### Britain Decides to Conclude a Three-Power Mutual Assistance Alliance with France and the Soviet Union: Based on the Principle of Absolute Equality; Drafting the Details of the Agreement Pending Negotiation

(London) According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, based on Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons today regarding the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, the British government will soon send a note to the Soviet Union, internationally accepting the basic proposal put forward by the Soviet Union for the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude a mutual assistance alliance. It is heard that under this alliance, if any one country rises up to assist an invaded country, the other two countries will immediately join in the assistance. The Prime Minister hinted that the various minor items that still need to be clarified will be discussed by the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, with the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, after he returns here from Geneva. It is the general opinion that this will not hinder the conclusion of the agreement or will only be related to the drafting of the detailed items. (Reuters, 24th)

(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this morning and immediately decided in principle to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. Political figures generally said that this was a victory for Foreign Secretary Halifax personally, and his reputation is increasingly admired by the cabinet members. The Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance agreement that the government has decided to conclude is based on the principle of absolute reciprocity. In other words, if one of the signatory countries is directly attacked or indirectly attacked for assisting its neighboring countries, the other signatory country should provide assistance. These so-called neighboring countries do not only refer to the Baltic Sea countries, but also Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium. At today's Cabinet meeting, some Cabinet members opposed the Anglo-Soviet agreement until the last moment. Prime Minister Chamberlain fully supported Foreign Secretary Halifax's view, saying that after Britain established agreements with Poland, Romania, Greece, and Turkey, it was natural and indispensable for Britain and the Soviet Union to conclude an agreement. The Cabinet finally decided to do so and entrusted Foreign Secretary Halifax to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union and to draft the agreement as soon as possible based on the principle of absolute reciprocity, so that it could be submitted for review before Prime Minister Chamberlain went to Scotland for rest tomorrow morning. At the same time, it will be sent to the governments of France, Poland, and Romania. Generally, Britain's proposal will be accepted by the Soviet government. Even if there are some minor issues to be negotiated, they can be resolved quickly. Conservative figures here are generally satisfied with the Cabinet's decision, saying that the agreements that Britain has concluded with Poland, Romania, Greece, and Turkey can now be effectively implemented. (Havas News Agency, 24th)

The Outline of the Agreement Contains Three Items

(London) Responsible sources here have recently confirmed that the anti-aggression joint defense agreement that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are about to conclude is a matter that has been agreed upon in principle by Britain and the Soviet Union. The word "joint defense" is particularly noteworthy and will be stated in the preamble to the agreement. The current step is for the British government to respond to the Soviet note sooner or later. As for the content, there is still no official news to verify it, but according to diplomatic sources, the main points of the Soviet government's previous proposal have been included. The outline contains approximately three items: (1) Any act of aggression against one of the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should be regarded as an act of aggression against all three countries. (2) If one of the signatory countries suffers a crisis due to fulfilling its obligations under the League of Nations covenant to other countries, the other signatory countries should provide assistance. (3) The three signatory countries should take various strategic and military measures so that, when necessary, they can implement mutually binding obligations. The outline is generally no more than this. What is unknown is whether the agreement will list the names of the countries that any one of the signatory countries is permitted to protect, or use the words "all countries that one of the signatory countries should protect or assist in accordance with its obligations under the League of Nations covenant," or use the words "all neighboring countries whose territorial integrity is necessary for the security of the three signatory countries." It is not known how the choices will be made. So far, Romania and other countries have expressed unwillingness to have their names included in the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Havas News Agency, 24th)

Applicable to Europe but Not to the Far East

(London) Diplomatic sources here have recently said that the agreement to be established between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union only applies to Europe and does not extend to the Far East. Regarding this, the Soviet government has not yet requested that the Far East issue be included in the agreement. This provides convenience for the British government, so that the agreement on the European part can be established more easily. The Soviet Union's moderate attitude can be seen from this. (Reuters, 24th)

(Tokyo) The "Kokumin Shimbun" claims to have learned from reliable sources that the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations are currently planning to add secret clauses to the three-nation alliance, stipulating that the scope of the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance includes the Far East. It is claimed that the three countries are preparing to provide active assistance to General Chiang Kai-shek, in the following ways: (1) providing supplies; (2) dispatching volunteer soldiers to participate in guerrilla warfare. According to the newspaper, there are three symbols of the joint effort of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to deal with Japan: (1) the recent repeated incursions of Outer Mongolian troops into the territory of "Manchukuo"; (2) the measures taken by Britain and France in Shanghai and Kulangsu; (3) the arrival of eight French military advisors in Chongqing. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)

The Soviet Side Remains Silent

(Geneva) Regarding the news that Britain has accepted the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, the Soviet representatives attending the League of Nations Administrative Council are quite silent about it. The Soviet delegation believes that it is still difficult to be optimistic because Chamberlain's words on this issue were very cautious. They believe that the conclusion of the agreement still requires lengthy negotiations. However, the current environment will eventually force the agreement to be completed. However, Britain, France, and other countries mostly believe that the Anglo-Soviet agreement can be concluded soon. According to French Foreign Minister Bonnet, the British Cabinet will inevitably accept the proposal to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. It is heard that British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax received a phone call from Chamberlain, stating briefly that Chamberlain had decided to accept the agreement. (Associated Press, 25th)

All Circles in Paris Express Welcome

(Paris) It is understood that the governments of Britain and France are scheduled to sign the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement on June 5. All sectors of the French government welcome the agreement, and those who oppose cooperation with the Soviet Union feel dissatisfied. At the same time, those who advocate the policy of "French imperialism" and oppose joining military agreements have been completely subdued. French newspapers commented that Britain decided to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union due to pressure from British public opinion. In addition to this agreement, the talks between the military commanders and military strategists of the three countries will be the most important, especially regarding the Anglo-Soviet experts' decision to use a large navy to defend the Baltic Sea. The Soviet Baltic Fleet includes more than fifty submarines, two battleships, and many cruisers and destroyers, and its strength is enough to harass the German navy, because the German side will divide its forces to cope with Britain's attack on the North Sea. If the Soviet Union adopts an offensive strategy in the Baltic Sea, Germany will find it difficult to purchase military materials from Sweden. Paris and London are now well aware of the reasons why the Soviet Union opposes the fortification of the Åland Islands and insists on obtaining military assistance if the Baltic Sea is attacked, because such moves would endanger the free action of the Soviet fleet. If the enemy occupies the Åland Islands and the coast of the Baltic Sea, the Soviet fleet is in danger of being blockaded in the Gulf of Finland. (Associated Press, 25th)

### Soviet Opposition to Fortifications on the Åland Islands: A Strategically Important Location Feared for Potential Exploitation by Aggressor Nations; Calls for League of Nations to Postpone Discussion

(Geneva) It is generally believed here that the Soviet Union's request for the League of Nations Administrative Council to postpone consideration of the Åland Islands issue is because Moscow, with Anglo-Soviet negotiations still ongoing, is unwilling to decide on its stance. The Åland Islands issue is expected to be raised for discussion at the public meeting of the Administrative Council on May 25th. (Reuter, 24th)

(Moscow) The Pravda editorial commenting on the Åland Islands issue states: "The regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council, which opened on the 22nd of this month, has begun discussing the Åland Islands issue. This issue was jointly submitted to the Administrative Council by the governments of Finland and Sweden. They presented a proposal to amend the 1921 Convention—which stipulates that the aforementioned archipelago shall not be fortified and shall be neutralized—requesting approval from the Administrative Council."

The Åland Islands issue is of great importance to international relations in Northeast Europe, as the archipelago is located at the confluence of the Bothnian Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Gulf of Finland, sufficient to control the sea lanes of the same sea and the two gulfs. This geographical location also makes the archipelago strategically important. A country occupying the islands could, by fortifying them, completely blockade the entrances and exits of the two gulfs at any time, preventing ships from passing. "The 1921 Convention governing the status of the Åland Islands was signed by many countries, the Soviet Union was not originally included. However, as the Soviet Union is located on the Gulf of Finland and is very close to the archipelago, it is naturally very concerned about the situation of the archipelago, whose occupier can control the gateway to the Gulf of Finland. The Åland Islands were originally Russian territory for over a hundred years. After the October Socialist Revolution, due to the Treaty of Peace concluded between the Russian Federation and Finland on October 14, 1920, Soviet Russia agreed to Finnish independence. This later fact is very important in the Åland Islands issue."

"After Soviet Russia ceded sovereignty over the Åland Islands to Finland, the League of Nations, on June 24, 1921, rejected Sweden's unfounded request regarding the archipelago and resolved to recognize that the archipelago belonged to Finland. Furthermore, in the 1921 Convention, Sweden's position was no different from that of other signatory states. Sweden's current actions are actually portraying itself as a country enjoying certain privileges in the archipelago and particularly concerned about its other statuses. Although there is no way to conduct affairs, it has long been decided that the Soviet Union holds a decisive position regarding the fate of the archipelago, and the facts also prove that the Soviet Union is directly related to this issue. However, the capitalist countries of Europe, starting from the October Revolution, have ignored all of the above, using all means to prevent the Soviet government from participating in the resolution of this issue. Regarding this point, the policies of the capitalist countries, including Finland, are well known to the world. They first carried out armed intervention against the Soviet Union, and after failing, they tried to isolate the Soviet Union internationally. The Soviet government repeatedly protested against this policy on October 2, 1919, June 28, 1910, July 22, 1911, and November 13. However, because the Soviet Union had recently undergone civil war and foreign counter-revolutionary intervention, there was no other way to protect its interests. The above protests were ignored, and the convention governing the current status of the Åland Islands was signed without the participation of the Soviet Union. This situation, of course, cannot eliminate the following undeniable and self-evident fact: that the Soviet Union, located on the Gulf of Finland, is naturally more concerned about the situation of the Åland Islands than other countries. Although the latter signed the 1921 Convention, for example, although countries such as Italy, Germany, France, and England signed the convention, how can their relationship with the archipelago be compared to that of the Soviet Union? And should Sweden, which does not occupy a special position in the convention, have more right than the Soviet Union to decide on the situation of the archipelago, even on the issue of its degree and nature of fortification?"

"As mentioned earlier, Finland has now jointly submitted a plan to the Administrative Council with Sweden to change the provisions of the 1921 Convention regarding the non-fortification and neutralization of the archipelago. The two governments have also sent official letters to each signatory state in advance, requesting agreement to amend the convention to allow Finland to fortify the archipelago. According to the communique published in Moscow newspapers yesterday, the Finnish government has also contacted the Soviet government regarding this issue. However, Finland did not seek the Soviet government's opinion on the Finnish-Swedish plan, nor did it request its consent to the fortification. The Finnish government only recognizes the Soviet Union as one of the member states of the League of Nations and requests its support so that the fortification plan can be passed by the Administrative Council. It seems that the two governments who submitted the issue of amending the situation to the League of Nations have completely forgotten the fact that the Soviet Union is directly and specially concerned about the situation of the Åland Islands." The Soviet government has notified the Finnish ambassador to Moscow to obtain several materials regarding the nature and extent of the proposed fortification of the archipelago. Before the Administrative Council makes any decision on this issue, the Soviet Union naturally hopes to understand the purpose of the proposed fortification of the archipelago, the actual situation of the fortification, and what guarantees can prevent the fortified Åland Islands from being exploited by a certain country to harm the Soviet Union. "Finnish newspapers have said that the Soviet Union's position is in conflict with protecting military secrets. This statement is not important, because Finland has already supplied this information to the Swedish government and voluntarily invited the government to participate in the implementation of the entire plan for the fortification of the archipelago. In this case, why should the Soviet Union, which is particularly concerned about this issue in national defense, not know the purpose and nature of its fortification? If the issue of fortifying the archipelago were decided solely by Finland, without the involvement of other countries, then the situation would be different, since Finland has sovereignty over the archipelago. The facts are not so now, but the Finnish government still refuses to supply the materials requested by the Soviet government. Under these conditions, the Soviet Union cannot but conclude that any decision made by the League of Nations Administrative Council on the Finnish-Swedish plan is premature, because the international nature of the Åland issue is very important. Any hasty decision made without sufficient preparation will further complicate international relations and be harmful to peace." "Considering this, the Soviet government has instructed its representative to the League of Nations to firmly insist that the League of Nations Administrative Council should postpone the discussion of the Åland issue at this session." (TASS, 27th)

### Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the Soviet Union and Poland; Rumors of a New Polish-Romanian Treaty; Warsaw Issues a Denial

Warsaw It is believed here today that the resumption of full diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland is related to the negotiations currently being initiated by Britain to organize an anti-aggression bloc. The procedures for the resumption of full diplomatic relations between the two countries have been completed today, as Soviet Ambassador to Poland, Mr. Shilanov, has taken office at the embassy here today. (Associated Press, 24th)

Warsaw Regarding recent reports in foreign newspapers that Poland and Romania have recently been conducting negotiations in Warsaw to discuss concluding a broader new Polish treaty to replace the old treaty, the authorities here have recently authorized the Polish News Agency to issue a message, solemnly stating a denial.

### Physiological Research on Marital Discord

The tragedy of discord between couples is prevalent in today's society. Minor quarrels and disputes turn what should be a harmonious and happy life into something akin to a city of sorrow and a sea of bitterness. Major ones can even lead to broken homes and deaths, and the social and national repercussions are severe! What is the reason for this? Staying true to our profession, we medical researchers should make judgments based on physiology. This is not because we doctors have nothing to do and want to force an explanation. It is feared that, in fact, the reasons for marital discord are mostly due to physiological differences or pathological states. This is a fact that has caused a sensation in history. Why did Napoleon divorce Josephine? Some say it was because she could not bear a royal heir, but Josephine had not been childless before. Napoleon also had a child with a Polish woman, but they could never have children in the thirteen years after their marriage. With Josephine's passion and the wealth of their home life, it would be natural for them to have a fulfilling married life and bear sons and daughters. However, they eventually announced their divorce. According to the analysis of American Medical Doctor Glys, Josephine was four years older than Napoleon and developed very early, marrying a French aristocrat at the age of sixteen. She only remarried Napoleon at the age of thirty-three, and her physiology was inevitably prematurely aging. At the same time, Napoleon's campaigns in the south and north probably made it difficult to coordinate their marital life. There are many similar facts in Chinese history as well. Why did Consort Yang Guifei harbor resentment in the Western Palace? Why did Empress Wu Zetian favor An Lushan? Why did Pan Jinlian have a one-sided love for Wu Song? Are these not all caused by dissatisfaction and disharmony between love and sex, which affects the relationship between husband and wife? Love and sex are based on physiology. Men and women who are physically strong will naturally have a strong desire for sex. A fulfilling sex life will inevitably lead to a close and sweet marital love, and bearing sons and daughters and a happy family are natural consequences. However, if one party cannot satisfy the other's sex life due to physiological pathological differences, even if they have always been an affectionate couple, they will inevitably develop cracks as a result? The most common example of this is when men suffer from masturbation, nocturnal emissions, or post-marital licentiousness and indulgence in their early years, resulting in seminal leakage, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm infertility, neurasthenia, etc., or when a beautiful woman has gray hair, resulting in a mismatch of physiological functions. Or multiple wives and early marriage, leading to the severing of sexual function. Then, in the normal life of the couple, they feel unable to cope, or even show premature aging, weakness, and incompetence, but how heartbroken is this for a beautiful wife in her prime, or a middle-aged woman with lingering charm? The reason for marital discord is mostly due to this. If you do not seek a remedy quickly, not only will it endanger your own life! The family tragedy will inevitably become more and more tragic! The way to remedy this is to fundamentally cure the disease. According to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, taking the male animal gonad preparation "Reproductin" is the most effective treatment for this, because this agent can produce sperm and invigorate the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, you will be able to eradicate the above symptoms early. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Simito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" (available in major Chinese and Western pharmacies in China, the UK, and other countries) to consolidate the seminal gate and prevent leakage, so the effect will be even faster.

### Six Major Harms of Untreated Seminal Emission

— Venereal Disease Specialist Doctor Zhan Nianceng

Because medical knowledge and practical experience tell us that seminal emission in young people is extremely important and should not be ignored as unimportant. If seminal emission is left untreated for too long, resulting in the depletion of essence and blood in the body, then the following six major harms are simply unavoidable. First, neurasthenia, all brainpower failure, poor memory, nocturnal dreaminess, or even insomnia, and even more frequent neuralgic brain swelling headaches; second, spinal nerve weakness, all limb fatigue, back pain, hand and foot tremors, motor ataxia, etc.; third, sexual nerve weakness, all spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, energy dissipation, etc.; fourth, impaired developmental function, the most common phenomenon being short stature, small genitals, and even young people who are already in their twenties who are completely no different from children. Fifth, excessive loss of semen, resulting in weakened function and reduced production of new semen. Even the small amount of semen produced is exceptionally thin and even lacks sperm, so they cannot have children. Sixth, due to the decline in metabolic function, it leads to a sallow complexion and emaciation, premature aging, or even premature death!

Since seminal emission has these six major harms, we must treat it thoroughly as early as possible. According to my many years of experience at home and abroad, taking "Simito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" is the most effective treatment for this, because this agent can consolidate the seminal gate, calm the nerves, reduce nocturnal dreams, and provide restful sleep, so seminal emission will heal itself. Although there are many types of seminal emission tablets sold on the market, their efficacy cannot be compared with it. If combined with the gonadotropic preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, essence and blood, and nerves, then both the root and the branch will be treated, and you will be able to restore perfect health early. Patients who can come to our clinic in person for diagnosis by specialist doctors and use scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery can be guaranteed to be cured.

### Women with Towering Breasts Are Most Proud

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Recently, the famous movie star Robert Taylor, who married Ms. Barbara Stanwyck, the star of "Miss Sandy Cody" in the United States, said these words: "We see that ladies with bright eyes and white teeth, gentle and affectionate, are certainly lovable, but we see that women with towering breasts, full hips, and touching flesh are especially lovable..." These words are correct and in line with physiological and aesthetic conditions, because women with towering breasts and full hips can not only form a very mysterious and wonderful curve in their posture, making every man who sees them feel like iron drawn by a magnet, involuntarily admire her, pursue her, and even miss her with obsession. As for their own health, due to the healthy function of the gonadal ovaries in the body and the vigorous metabolism, the development of each part is perfect, the muscles are smooth, and the face is like a flower in spring, appearing delicate and radiant. As for their clear understanding, rich emotions, agile thinking, and gentle manners, they are especially beyond the reach of ordinary women with irregular menstruation, lingering leucorrhea, malnutrition, resulting in breast atrophy and pain, and slender hips. Therefore, the eyes of men of the times must take healthy and beautiful women as their object, and ugly women with flat breasts and thin buttocks will undoubtedly be scorned by people, and their fate will be very tragic!

Can such defects be compensated for? According to the research results of world-renowned gynecologists Dr. Condrellin and Harvard Locke Ellis, it has been confirmed that only taking the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductin" can compensate for this in the short term, because the ingredients of this agent are extracted from the essence of the ovaries of extremely strong animals and prepared by scientific methods, so the medicinal properties are mild and the efficacy is great. If you continue to take it, you can not only make the atrophied breasts gradually become towering, and the slender hips gradually become full, but also adjust menstruation, give a rosy complexion, and maintain youth.

### On the Contraindications and Treatment of Urethral Injections

A treatment must be appropriate for the symptoms of a disease. Often, a certain treatment is effective in one place, but in another place, it is not only ineffective but also harmful. For example, in the treatment of gonorrhea, the injection method is like this. Originally, the urethral injection method is not a particularly effective treatment for gonorrhea, but it can have considerable efficacy if used properly. However, it is also harmful to use it in certain places. For example, when the inflammation of the urethral mucosa is severe, or when the corpus cavernosum is also inflamed, and when urination is very painful, the injection method should not be used. Furthermore, the injection method can only be used for urethritis without complications. If there are already complications such as orchitis, prostatitis, or cystitis, the injection method is also ineffective. In addition, all those with tuberculosis and other diseases and systemic weakness should not use it.

In the above cases, first make the patient's mind and body quiet, then inject their own bacterial vaccine and anti-inflammatory methods. After the acute symptoms have subsided, then use the urethral injection method to be harmless and beneficial. However, this type of injection method also requires an experienced doctor to use agile surgery to treat it. One side uses German filtrate electrophoresis therapy to ensure that the gonorrhea bacteria hidden in the urethra are thoroughly and quickly eliminated. Moreover, the toxins produced by the gonorrhea bacteria are also filtered by the filtrate electrotherapy, because many gonorrhea symptoms, such as neuralgia, are mostly caused by the invasion of the gonorrhea toxins.

In addition, when applying the method of entering therapy, urethral mirrors and bladder reflex mirrors must be used to examine it first to clarify the truth, and then the condition can be treated symptomatically, so that there will be no loss of even one ten thousandth of a chance. Otherwise, if the injection method is used rashly, there will be no failure. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

Subjects

Also treats syphilis, inguinal lymphogranuloma, chancroid, and painless new method circumcision.

### The Turmoil and Instability of the Eurasian Situation; The Need for Cooperation Between the Old and New Worlds to Prevent the Destruction of Human Civilization; The King of England's Broadcast Speech in the American Continent

Winnipeg Today, on Empire Day, the King of England gave a radio broadcast speech, stating that the civilization of Europe and Asia is indeed in a whirlwind. The Old World may need to look to the guidance of the New World. We often talk about the Old World and the New World. One of the greatest tasks of the British Empire is to make the Empire a unifying lock for the two worlds. In the long history, those who guided the progress and fixed purpose of world civilization were European ideas, but the tide of influence is no longer as surging as it used to be. The civilization of Christianity in Europe is now in deep water, and is in conflict from within. We are now striving to restore its standards, but it will take a long time and be difficult. Asia is also undergoing rapid changes, and its thinking has been deeply disturbed. The Old World is currently in turmoil, and it relies on the success of the New World to provide hope and guidance. Is this not the right time? Racial ideas may become a dangerous and collapsing force, but Britain and France have proven in Canada that they are able to maintain their glorious and distinctive cultures. This can inspire Canada, and at the same time, it can cooperate to build greater freedom and security than it can achieve alone. This is not the only chapter in North American history that should be respected. In the past hundred years, Canada and the United States have eliminated all the harsh differences in each other's purposes and interests, and no dispute has ever been resolved by force or threats. With God's blessing, no one will now think of using such judgments between the people of Canada and the United States in the future. Faith, reason, and justice are the main principles that the British Empire adheres to in all its actions today. This is what we share with the Americans. The true greatness of the Empire does not depend solely on its wealth, nor on its ability to rule other nations. This is just a tool, not a purpose or principle. The purpose of the Empire is in the plans of the people, to enable everyone to obtain freedom and justice, and to be safe from internal and external attacks. The Empire can only be called a servant for its own people and the people of the world by adding to the mental dignity and material happiness of life in hundreds of millions of families. The King of England specifically encouraged the young listeners, instructing them to remember that the key to true progress lies in faith, hope, and love. (Reuter, 24th)

Winnipeg The King and Queen of England arrived here at 10:30 this morning. The King and Queen had spent two consecutive nights in the train on the way from Fort William West. When Manitoba Premier Blegan delivered a speech welcoming the King and Queen, he said that the people of Manitoba do not forget the best traditions of their motherland. They all regard their monarch as a citizen of Canada and are proud to be a member of the Dominion. What they are even more proud of is the King of England and the British parliamentary system. In his reply, the King said that Manitoba unites many races and forms a common citizenship. The habit of tolerance and the principles of democracy, which create such a bright effect, are something that Manitoba can be proud of. I am very pleased to see the prosperous population in the territory on the way west, and to see all kinds of material and social progress. It is a pleasure to be able to visit this place in person. I deeply pray that Manitoba can continue to prosper under God's blessing. (Reuter, 14th)

### Soviet Supreme Council Opens, Gathering Representatives of Over a Hundred Nationalities in One Hall, Molotov to Deliver Important Speech

(Moscow) The Soviet Supreme Council, probably the most ethnically diverse parliament in Europe, is scheduled to begin its first meeting of 1939 tonight in the former Russian Imperial Palace here. Over 1,200 representatives of more than a hundred nationalities will be present, gathering representatives from Russia, Central Asia, Siberia, Mongolia, the Caucasus, and other regions. The variety of peoples is unprecedented in other national parliaments. After Stalin and the cabinet members enter the meeting room, the opening ceremony will be held. However, Stalin may not participate in the debates. The most important item on the agenda is that Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and concurrently Foreign Minister, will deliver a speech first, followed by a general debate on the international situation by the attendees. It is expected that Molotov will explain the reasons for the resignation of former Foreign Minister Litvinov, and national defense and the Third Five-Year Plan will also be debated. The session will last for a week or ten days. (Reuters, 25th)

(Moscow) The Soviet Supreme Council held its third regular session this afternoon in the Kremlin. The session was chaired by Antralev, Chairman of the Council of the Union. Stalin was not present, but Potemkin, First Deputy of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov were present, which attracted considerable attention. The agenda for this regular session includes the following items: (1) Approval of the 1939 budget; (2) Approval of the 1938 final accounts; (3) Establishment of the People's Commissariat for the Automotive Industry; (4) Ratification of various measures taken by the People's Commissariat after the closing of the previous regular session.

### German-Polish Relations Extremely Tense, Danzig's Unreasonable Demands, Difficult for Poland to Accept

Danzig The relations between Warsaw and Berlin reached an extremely tense level last night after the Danzig Senate, under the rule of the National Socialist Party, lodged a strong protest with the Polish government regarding the recent border conflicts between Poland and Danzig. It is said that if the protest lodged by the Danzig Senate is not satisfactorily answered, Germany will intervene directly and protest to Poland. (Associated Press, 25th)

Danzig Danzig Senate President Greiser yesterday submitted a diplomatic note to the Polish government, lodging a strong protest against Poland's violation of Danzig's autonomous territory. The note listed six incidents: (1) Recently, many innocent travelers passing through the Danzig-Polish border have often been shot at by Polish soldiers; (2) The official committees appointed by the Danzig authorities are often prevented from carrying out investigations by Polish soldiers; (3) Polish soldiers patrolling the border often cross the Danzig border; (4) Polish military aircraft repeatedly appear over the city of Danzig; (5) A Polish driver in Karlshof shot and killed an innocent traveler, Gruebler; (6) The murderer was sheltered by Polish diplomats and safely crossed the border. The note stated that if Danzig officials and civilians had not strictly observed discipline, unfortunate consequences would have already occurred. Therefore, it demanded that the Polish government immediately take necessary measures to restore order on the border and cease the actions of the Poles. (Haitong, 25th)

Warsaw The incidents occurring at the border between Poland and the Free City of Danzig are not isolated. Among them, the Karlshof case involved the death of one Danzig citizen, while other cases were less serious. Under normal circumstances, these incidents would not be noteworthy. However, given the tense relations between Germany and Poland, they take on a serious nature. Furthermore, after each incident, the Danzig Senate invariably lodges a strong protest with the Polish government, which responds with equally strong words. Both sides make demands of each other and reject each other's demands. Among the demands made by the Danzig Senate to the Polish government are: (1) an apology; (2) maintaining order on the Danzig border; (3) recalling three customs officials to Poland. The Polish government considers these demands unreasonable and refuses to accept them. It also makes two demands of the Danzig Senate: (1) compensation for the damages suffered by Polish customs officials in Karlshof; (2) guarantees for the safety of Polish customs officials. Karlshof is a strategically important location, as the only railway and highway lines from Danzig to the outside world pass through it. Currently, Poland has established customs posts there for surveillance. If this right of surveillance were to be abolished, Germany could freely smuggle in military equipment, which Poland cannot accept. From a legal standpoint, the League of Nations has recognized Poland's right to send troops into Danzig to maintain order and protect its own interests. The intention of the leaders of the National Socialist Party in the city is probably to induce Poland to exercise this right, thereby providing Germany with an excuse for intervention. Fortunately, Poland remains calm and will not resort to this unless absolutely necessary. In Warsaw, Germans say that if Germany takes action against Danzig, Poland will resist. Hitler is well aware of this, and therefore has not yet decided what attitude to take. (Havas, 24th)

### German and Italian Chiefs of Staff Hold Talks, Discussing Air Force Cooperation, Chamberlain Believes Axis Pact Does Not Conflict with Anglo-Italian Agreement

(Rome) After the establishment of the German-Italian alliance, both sides began to implement the alliance. Today, German Air Force Chief of Staff General Milch, under the command of Air Minister Goering, led several air force officers to Italy. They have already arrived here and immediately began talks with Italian Air Force Chief of Staff General Valle. The meeting lasted for an hour and a half. It is reported that Milch and his party will stay here for several days. (Havas, 24th)

(London) In a speech delivered in the House of Commons this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed the German-Italian alliance treaty, saying, "Upon examining the published provisions of this treaty, it does not appear that any clause conflicts with Italy's obligations to Britain. The obligations between Britain and Italy were first stipulated in the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement of January 2, 1937, and subsequently reaffirmed by the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 16, 1938." This is Chamberlain's definitive statement on the German-Italian alliance in the House of Commons. (Havas, 24th)

### American Submarine Accident, Rescue Efforts Underway, Divers Descend to a Depth of 240 Feet, Thirty-Six Crew Members Rescued

Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA After the submarine "Squalus," with a crew of 62 officers and men, sank off the coast of New England yesterday, 36 officers and men in the front part of the submarine were rescued by a diving bell. During the fourth and final rescue operation, when the diving bell was bringing the captain and eight sailors to 140 feet below the surface, the mechanism suddenly malfunctioned and could not rise. Several divers were dispatched to repair it, which took two hours before the task was completed and the captain and sailors were rescued. In addition, 26 people died, and all the bodies will be recovered by divers entering the submarine. Once they are recovered, measures can be taken to salvage the submarine. (Havas, 24th)

Portsmouth The American submarine "Squalus" sank outside White Island yesterday and is in a critical situation. Fifteen of the 59 crew members have been raised to the surface by a rescue device. According to them, 25 crew members are confirmed to be still alive. These 15 people were rescued in two batches. The first batch rescued seven people to the surface, and the second batch rescued eight people. Their condition is good, and they can walk without assistance. Preparations are now being made to immediately dive again to rescue everyone from a depth of 240 feet, a pioneering feat in naval history. When the rescue device rose to the surface, the crew members of the rescue ship (Falcon) cheered. The rescue work gave new hope to the wives and other women of the crew members, who have been anxiously waiting on shore for 24 hours. Earlier, a diver entered the water and performed an amazing task for nearly an hour, connecting an air pipe to the submarine. After stopping for another hour, he lowered the rescue device into the sea and rescued the crew members for the first time. The crew members trapped in the submarine had sent a signal stating that of the 59 people on board, only 33 in the front part of the submarine were not injured. They also said that the temperature was suitable and there was enough food, but the lights and electricity were cut off. All parts of the submarine can be contacted by signal, except for the torpedo room. It is believed that the room is completely flooded, and several crew members are trapped inside. (Reuters, 24th)

### German Volunteers Withdraw from Spain

Vigo, Spain The German "Condor" Legion volunteers, all of whom are technicians, including pilots, artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, and anti-tank artillery officers and soldiers, totaling 5,000 people, arrived here yesterday from the city of León on three special trains. They immediately formed ranks and proceeded to the pier, where they boarded three transport ships. It is said that they will leave here on the 26th to return to their country. German and Spanish flags were hung throughout the city, and large crowds gathered at the pier to see them off. (Havas, 24th)

### Estonian Fire, the Town of Petseri Reduced to Ashes, Over a Thousand People Homeless

Tallinn A major fire broke out in the Estonian town of Petseri yesterday, and almost all the important buildings in the town were completely burned down. Because the wind was very strong at the time, the fire spread throughout the town in less than an hour after a wooden house was carelessly ignited. By 1 p.m., the wind had gradually decreased, and the fire subsided. Later, the wind picked up again, and sparks flew everywhere, affecting two neighboring villages. As of 6 p.m. last night, both villages were still burning. Petseri is located in southeastern Estonia. In the 15th century, a church was built in the town, which contained many priceless treasures. Fortunately, this fire did not affect it. (Haitong, 25th)

Tallinn In yesterday's fire in Petseri, more than 200 houses were destroyed, leaving an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 residents homeless. The property loss amounts to millions. (Haitong, 25th)

### Recent Developments in the European Situation

— Uncle Di

The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East (Continued) European Correspondence

From beginning to end, Britain's plan has been one-sided, focusing on cooperation in resisting aggression by Germany and Italy against third countries, rather than forming an alliance that shares its fate with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has insisted on a mutually beneficial agreement similar to an alliance. Thus, another stalemate has emerged.

In this way, Chamberlain has presented a very clear situation to Hitler: attacking Britain and France would inevitably lead to the Soviet Union's involvement, while attacking the Soviet Union would not necessarily bring Britain and France into the conflict. However, Hitler ignores this and continues to collude with Mussolini according to his fixed plan, preparing to further extort Britain and France. On the Soviet side, it is of course impossible to allow itself to be exposed to the danger of attack for long and must take defensive measures. Thus, Foreign Minister Litvinov, the strongest advocate of collective security, resigned at this very moment.

Litvinov's resignation is a clear demonstration to Britain and France, and Britain was indeed shocked for a considerable period. However, what shocked them even more was the sudden uproar of news about a rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany.

(II) The possibility of a buffer between the Soviet Union and Germany

If Britain does not correct its current illusions and make the greatest determination, then a buffer between the Soviet Union and Germany is not only possible but inevitable. The key to success or failure lies in whether Germany can allow Poland to maintain its neutrality as a buffer zone between Germany and the Soviet Union. Apart from this, the conditions for a buffer agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany already exist: (1) the Soviet Union's anti-aggression focus is now not in Europe but in the Far East; (2) Germany's coveted targets are the colonies of Britain and France, not the Ukrainian region of the Soviet Union; (3) China's resistance war has created a new situation in the Far East, weakening Japanese fascism and creating new hope for the Soviet Union to gain the assistance of a powerful ally in the East, while also increasing Germany and Italy's doubts about Japan's ability to threaten Britain and France. In the face of the increasingly close relationship between China and the Soviet Union, Japan's gradual inability to echo Germany and Italy, and Britain and France's continued estrangement from the Soviet Union, the future relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly show a considerable degree of understanding.

This is only theory. What is the reality? Recently, it is worth noting that Kandalaki (David Kandalekl), one of Stalin's most trusted figures, suddenly appeared in Berlin. Everyone knows that this Kandalaki has visited Berlin several times before in order to promote a rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union, and the most successful visit was to Germany in mid-April 1937. At that time, it was the eve of the Sino-Japanese War, and the Soviet Union was very willing to reach a certain understanding with Germany. However, because of Hitler's arrogance at that time, the understanding that had already been reached was declared a failure at the last minute. The current situation is different, and Japan's power in the East has been greatly reduced. At this time, this gentleman's visit to Berlin is a headache for Britain and France. (To be continued)

### Lu Richu Arrested and Executed in Dinghai, Former Puppet Huanghai Pacification Commander

Dinghai Correspondence: Lu Richu, a native of Wujiang, Jiangsu, colluded with the Japanese puppets and served as the puppet Huanghai Pacification Commander. He gathered maritime bandits and plotted to disturb eastern Zhejiang. He was captured by a team dispatched by the Dinghai County Government. According to the interrogation, he confessed to working for the Japanese puppets and plotting against the country. He was sentenced to death in accordance with the regulations on punishing traitors. After being submitted to and approved by the Provincial Security Commander and the Director of the Security Office, he was executed on the spot. At 2 p.m. on the 15th, he was taken from prison to the court, his identity was verified, and he was tied and taken to the execution ground outside Xidou, where he was shot. He was shot five times in the head, face, chest, and abdomen, and died instantly.

### Inspection of the Central China Frontline, When Chinese Troops Recaptured Zaoyang, Japanese Casualties Exceeded 20,000, Japanese Troops Launched Offensive in Northern Hubei, Fierce Fighting

Reuters Special Correspondent Correspondence: According to front-line Chinese officers speaking to reporters, the gains from months of fierce fighting by Japanese troops in Hubei Province are practically of no military value. Japanese troops twice attempted to cross the Han River north of Zhongxiang and cut off the highway from Yichang to Xiangyang, but both attempts failed due to the strength of the Chinese defenses. The Japanese troops were forced to advance north, aiming for Xiangyang, 170 miles northwest of Hankou. The Chinese positions in the mountains around Suixian were eventually destroyed by Japanese artillery. The Japanese troops also crossed the plains west of Suixian and reached Zaoyang. However, the Japanese troops were exhausted by this point, and the Chinese troops began a counterattack.

Recapture of Zaoyang

Forcing the Japanese troops to retreat eastward, Chinese sources estimate that Japanese casualties exceeded 20,000. This number may be an exaggeration, but after observing the positions around Suixian, it is felt that Japanese casualties of several thousand are not impossible. Therefore, Japanese casualties are likely between 6,000 and 10,000. The countryside between Xiangyang and Suixian is all wheat fields, posing no obstacle to the movement of mechanized units. Although mountains are visible to the north, there are few defensible high points directly to Suixian. When the reporter arrived in Suixian, he traveled by car with a guide to a place outside Zaoyang. Beyond this point, the highway had been destroyed. After spending the night at the local transport command, he was supplied with horses to go to the

Frontline for Inspection

Along the way, farmers were busy with their agricultural work as the harvest season approached, and women in the villages were preparing food for the troops passing through. As the reporter approached the front line, he saw a group of wounded soldiers. All the stretchers were carried by farmers. It is said that this was entirely of their own volition and there was no coercion involved. When the reporter returned from the front line, he witnessed an event that proved the above statement was not false. Two soldiers were carrying a stretcher together. The one in front was small and exhausted from walking too much, so he stopped by the roadside and asked a farmer standing nearby for help. The farmer immediately agreed and carried the stretcher for two miles, while the soldier walked slowly behind to rest. That evening, the reporter approached Suixian. The next morning, he rode into the city. The desolation in the city was rare. Suixian had been less than three miles from the front line for nearly six months. Shells fell from time to time, and the city had been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, causing the residents to flee. The reporter heard that the British

Missionary Church

North of Suixian still had two foreign missionaries living there and went to visit them. He saw that the gate and walls of the church had been destroyed by bombs and were temporarily replaced with broken boards. A wooden board painted with the British flag was nailed on top of them. After the reporter knocked on the door, two tall Englishmen in Chinese clothing opened the door. They looked at the reporter with surprise and said, "You are actually the first foreigner we have met in the past six months." The two introduced themselves as Mr. Luo of the Central China School and Mr. Graham of the British Methodist Church in Suixian. They asked the soldiers who were guiding the horses to wait outside the city gate. They said that the church building had been bombed twice and that the presence of soldiers would likely cause them to be attacked again. The consulting room and pharmacy of the church hospital were destroyed last November. Because all the medicines and equipment were gone, the hospital had to be closed. Currently, only one trained nurse is staying here. She is working with two Irish Catholic priests to try to set up a shelter in the empty courtyard of the church to accommodate the few poor residents in the city when Japanese troops occupy the county seat. The reporter immediately gave them the smallpox vaccine that the Xiangyang Hospital had given him for the use of this shelter. The two Bickers were eager to inquire about the situation outside, such as whether Europe was about to declare war, whether this was likely in the near future, and what Japan would do if a European war broke out, as well as the latest developments in the Sino-Japanese War. The reporter answered in detail to the best of his knowledge. As we were talking,

Shelling Began Violently

The buildings shook. The Japanese troops, after launching an offensive in northern Hubei, began to bombard the Chinese positions northeast of Suixian. The sounds of various calibers of artillery fire could be clearly heard. When shells fired by Japanese six-inch heavy artillery landed and exploded, even though they were still five miles away, the building we were in shook. The two Bickers finally talked about the hardships of their lives. After the conversation, the reporter said goodbye and continued to advance to the front line. After arriving at the brigade headquarters, they sent someone to guide him to the front. He heard that the Japanese troops were currently attacking the county seat from the northeast and southwest in an attempt to encircle it. Led by a regimental commander, the reporter passed through deep communication trenches and supply routes to the most advanced machine gun

positions. From here, one could see the Japanese positions a hundred meters away. Because

both sides' defenses

were very solid, the war has been rather quiet in the past six months. The Chinese machine gun outposts were built very strongly and were not easily bombed. Behind the positions, there were strong air raid shelters for soldiers to hide from air raids and shells. In the gullies behind, farmers were engaged in farming. According to the commander of the troops stationed there, the houses of these farmers had been destroyed by artillery fire, but because we are here, they are all willing to stay and do not want to leave. If the shelling is too heavy during the day, they work at night. We have promised to notify them before we retreat so that they can leave in time. The troops stationed here

are all Guangxi troops.

The configuration of small arms, machine guns, and hand grenades is very sufficient. The mortars used are all made in China and are very effective. The morale of the Chinese troops here is very high. A soldier once told the reporter about nightly raids on Japanese positions and the resulting melee battles. It is said that the Japanese troops are forced to adopt this strategy, but they are ultimately not as good as the Chinese troops at it. According to various officers (including several senior ones) who told the reporter, the

ratio of casualties

between Chinese and Japanese troops averages between seven and ten, that is, seven Chinese soldiers die for every ten Japanese soldiers who die. That night, when I arrived at the division headquarters, I learned that the Chinese troops had killed 600 Japanese soldiers during the day, and the Japanese had lost 1,000 men. Although we could barely see the place where it had been bombed, I fortunately declined to go and inspect the area and avoided disaster. Near the front line, I saw twenty orphans being escorted out of the war zone, led by a soldier and followed by a Chinese woman serving at the front. The orphans all walked along the winding road, some holding hands, some singing, but they were slightly tired from running in the hot sun.

### Letter

To the Esteemed Editor:

I recently read a news item in your paper on the 24th of this month entitled "Movements of Puppets in Xuzhou," which stated that the President of the Puppet District Court of Xuzhou is Tian Wennong. I was very surprised. After investigation, Tian Wennong has been living in Shanghai since the fall of Xuzhou, for eight months now. He is not at all clear about the situation in Xuzhou, let alone the fact that he served as the President of the Puppet District Court. I believe this is a false rumor. I am sincerely afraid of confusing the public and therefore respectfully request that you correct it. I am deeply grateful.

Sincerely, Tian Wennong, 25th

Education News

### China: An Overview of Secondary Normal Education (I) - Normal Schools Emphasize Professional Training - Normal Schools are Established by the Government by District

(Chongqing Correspondence) There are 814 normal schools across all provinces and cities in China, with 86,779 students, and a budget of 10,699,605 yuan. The Ministry of Education has compiled detailed statistics and reports on secondary normal education in China. An outline is excerpted below:

System Aspects

From the beginning of education promotion in China, normal schools were listed alongside middle schools. Since the implementation of the new school system in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, middle schools have been broadly established, with senior middle schools divided into general, normal, and vocational tracks. Since then, the original provincial normal schools in various regions have successively merged into the provincial middle schools in the same location, called senior high normal departments. At the same time, many public and private middle schools have also added normal departments. Furthermore, because the normal departments had to recruit junior middle school graduates, and most junior middle school graduates volunteered to enter the general departments, there were too few senior normal students, which was not enough to meet the large demand for primary school teachers. Various places also started to run normal departments at the same level as junior middle schools, called preliminary normal schools, and short-term teacher training classes ranging from one to four years were also set up in a mixed manner, called normal training courses, to meet the urgent need for primary school teachers. As a result, normal education lost its inherent independent position in the middle education stage and became subordinate to middle schools. Normal students were taught in the same furnace as middle school students, and their due professional training could not be fully developed. After several years of implementation, the effectiveness of the multi-departmental middle school system was not apparent, and the inherent functions of normal education gradually disappeared, which had a significant impact on primary school education. After the founding of the National Government, the former University Council, in view of this, specially formulated several principles for normal education facilities and issued them as a general order. The main point was that normal schools should be established independently as a principle. This was the dawn of the revival of normal education. The Ministry of Education, based on this policy, supervised and moved forward, and educators in various places gradually felt the necessity of independent establishment of normal education, and separated the normal departments from the scope of middle schools, restoring the separate establishment of normal schools. The opportunity for reform matured. In December of the twenty-first year, the National Government promulgated the Normal School Law, and at the same time promulgated the Middle School Law and the Vocational School Law. Thus, the system of independent establishment of normal schools was established. In the twenty-second year, the Ministry of Education formulated the Regulations for Normal Schools based on this, and continued to revise them in the twenty-fourth year. The Normal School Law stipulates that normal schools may be attached with special normal departments and kindergarten normal departments. The admission requirements for normal schools and kindergarten normal departments must be graduation from public or registered private junior middle schools. The duration of study in normal schools is three years, and the duration of study in kindergarten normal departments is two or three years. The admission requirements for special normal departments must be graduation from public or registered private senior middle schools or senior vocational schools, and the duration of study is one year. This is the standard for training primary school teachers, specialized teachers, and kindergarten teachers. The Regulations for Normal Schools stipulate the methods for simple normal schools and simple normal departments. The admission requirement for simple normal schools is graduation from primary school, and the duration of study is four years. The admission requirement for simple normal departments is graduation from junior middle school, and the duration of study is one year. This is a variation for training teachers for simple primary schools, short-term primary schools, and junior primary schools. In the future, when the supply of primary school teachers in the region is sufficient, it should be stopped. Since normal schools aim to train primary school teachers, and most primary schools are located in rural areas, rural primary school teachers should have special training to fulfill their duties. Therefore, another type of normal school should be rural normal schools, and another type of simple normal school should be simple rural normal schools. The main purpose is to train rural primary school teachers. Not only should rural normal schools and simple rural normal schools be located in rural areas, but also normal schools should be located in rural areas as much as possible. Previously, the barriers between normal schools and rural normal schools could be gradually eliminated. Teachers are the most suitable profession for women, especially primary school teachers. Therefore, there are normal schools that specialize in recruiting female students, called female normal schools. The training of primary school teachers originally takes the form of all-around training, especially in subjects such as music, art, physical education, games, and manual labor, where talent is most important and special training must be provided. Another goal of special normal departments is to meet this need, and there should also be a method of grouping and studying specialized subjects in normal schools. Expanding the spirit of this method, it is also possible to set up single-subject normal schools, and the establishment of physical education normal departments is inevitable. Therefore, although there are many types of normal schools, their system is still relatively simple, that is, the two levels of normal schools and simple normal schools, female normal schools. Rural normal schools are different types of normal schools, three-year and two-year kindergarten normal departments, and physical education normal departments are branches of normal schools, special normal departments are variations of normal schools, simple rural normal schools are different types of simple normal schools, and simple normal departments are variations of simple normal schools. That's all.

Setup Aspects

Normal schools are established by the province or the city directly under the Executive Yuan. However, depending on the needs of the region, they may also be established by counties or jointly by two or more counties. This is the provision of Article 4 of the Normal School Law, which means that normal schools should be established by the province or county, and private individuals are not allowed to establish them, which is different from middle schools. Normal schools are the source of primary school teachers, and primary schools are the foundation of national education. What the state requires of primary school teachers should be cultivated by schools established by administrative agencies at all levels, and should not be authorized to any private individuals. This is an important policy on the establishment of normal schools, which has not been available before. In order to take into account the facts, private normal schools that already exist in various places, either with a long history and excellent performance, or specializing in training specialized primary school teachers, have completed the registration procedures and can continue to operate, and the rest are subject to banning.

After normal schools were once merged into middle schools, the number of schools decreased sharply. Although they later regained their independent status and were successively separated, there was no overall plan. The establishment of simple normal schools was even more chaotic. Often, counties in the province, regardless of the actual needs and financial surpluses and deficits, were simple and shortened the duration of study. In name, they were simple normal schools, but in reality, they did not meet the regulations. All of this should be adjusted immediately. Article 10 of the Revised Regulations for Normal Schools stipulates that each province should divide the province into several normal education zones according to the situation, but few provinces have followed it. In May of the twenty-seventh year, the Ministry of Education issued a general order that normal education should be planned as a whole, and the method of dividing normal education zones was determined. The main points are that each province should divide the province into several normal education zones according to the local traffic, population, economy, culture, and existing school conditions, with the principle of setting up a provincial normal school or rural normal school in the zone, and coordinating with several simple normal schools or simple rural normal schools jointly established by the counties or two or more counties, so that the number of schools is sufficient to cultivate the primary school teachers needed in various places in the zone, without the disadvantage of excess or deficiency. If education in the zone is not yet developed, the province may temporarily set up simple normal schools or simple rural normal schools, and counties with undeveloped education may not set up simple normal schools. The existing simple normal schools and various short-term teacher training classes that do not meet the regulations should be adjusted separately within a time limit, or ordered to end, or ordered to merge, or ordered to enrich and reorganize, depending on the needs, funding, and other relevant conditions. Each zone should have a female normal school, or a female department attached to the normal school. The number of classes and the number of students enrolled each year in each school in the zone should be calculated in detail and implemented after being approved by the provincial department. If this is the case, the system and establishment of normal schools can be coordinated, and their overall facilities will be systematic, planned, and without the disadvantages of deformed, scattered, partial, withered, and wasteful.

### Ningbo Primary School Children Dispersed with Their Families - Authorities Stipulate Borrowing Procedures

(Ningbo News) Ningbo has been bombed repeatedly, and people have dispersed to the inland. The county authorities, in order to provide relief to primary school children who have gone to the countryside with their families due to the dispersed population, have already formulated the points to be noted for primary schools at all levels and the borrowing procedures. The main points are excerpted as follows: (1) The above-mentioned children may enroll in schools near their new residence with the borrowing certificate from their original school, without having to pay again. (2) If the above-mentioned children pass the graduation examination of the borrowing school, they may request the original school to issue a certificate with the transcript.

### The City's Vocational Guidance is More Redundant Than Before the War

The Vocational Guidance Institute attached to the Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society reported that when the war first broke out in Shanghai, social order was extremely chaotic, and vocational guidance work had to be temporarily suspended. Now the number of schools has increased, and many people have come to Shanghai to take refuge, so the number of citizens has increased sharply, and problems such as seeking employment and studying have become more needed. Therefore, the affairs of the Vocational Guidance Institute have suddenly become busy and more redundant than usual. The institute is a purely service organization, and no fees are charged for introduction and registration. Every day, dozens to more than a hundred people go to talk. Last year, the number of job seekers was 2,040, of which 1,578 were men, accounting for 77%, and 462 were women, accounting for 23%.

### Xiqing Handball Doubles Final: Zhu Kuan and Sun Daosheng Lost Unfortunately - Qukeling and Huamu Won the Championship

The 5th Xiqing Handball Championship held its doubles final at the association at 6:30 yesterday. The opponents were Zhu Kuan and Sun Daosheng, and F. Qukeling and Huamu. Quke and Hua had defeated Zhu and Sun in the second week. Yesterday, the enemies met on a narrow road, and the match was extremely exciting. After three thrilling sets, Quke and Hua finally defeated Zhu and Sun again by two to one and won the doubles championship. This Xiqing Handball Championship came to a successful conclusion. According to Zhu Kuan, who has been known as the invincible king, and Sun Daosheng, who is known for his wisdom, Quke and Hua were able to win twice. The reason for this is not that Huamu's skills are better than Zhu Kuan's, or that F. Qukeling's wisdom is higher than Sun Daosheng's. What they rely on is that Hua's physique is strong, his arm strength is amazing, and Quke is known for his stability.

### Major Foreign Banks Do Not Accept Hua Xing Counterfeit Money; Shanghai Municipal Council Is Even Unwilling to Consider It; Customs Refuses to Comment; The Yen Was Higher Yesterday But Will Continue to Fall

The Continental News reports that a Japanese spokesperson stated at a press conference on Tuesday evening that "all" foreign banks on the south bank of Suzhou Creek had accepted banknotes issued by the Japanese-controlled Hua Xing Commercial Bank. Senior officials from every major foreign bank in Shanghai told reporters yesterday (the 24th) that they would not accept such counterfeit money. Other foreign bankers stated that Hua Xing Bank's "capital" had always been "a mystery," and even with a significant discount, they would not accept counterfeit money. It is reported that official circles hold the same

indifferent attitude

towards the new Hua Xing banknotes as the banking community. When reporters inquired with a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday about whether the Public Concession would accept Hua Xing banknotes for the payment of municipal taxes, the response was that the Shanghai Municipal Council did not even want to consider the matter. Meanwhile, Chinese sources reported last night that importers and exporters might pay customs duties with counterfeit money. It is recalled that shortly after the establishment of the counterfeit bank, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai put great pressure on the customs to immediately accept the bank's banknotes. However, the Consular Body here offered

strong opposition

. When reporters asked Mr. Robert F. C. August Loder, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, yesterday, Mr. Loder said that he refused to provide any information and did not want to confirm or deny the report. However, according to Chinese banking circles, the Japanese side would not make any effort to circulate the "Hongkou currency" (the name given to Hua Xing banknotes here) into the market on the south bank of Suzhou Creek. A Chinese banker emphatically stated that if the Japanese side could get most of the people in the occupied areas to accept the currency, it would be more than satisfied. However,

we must not forget

that even Hua Xing Bank's employees are paid their salaries in legal tender. If the Japanese side acts rashly and makes another doomed attempt to force Chinese residents in the foreign concessions to accept counterfeit money, it is expected that the same situation that is currently happening in North China will occur here. The legal tender, which is generally regarded as good money, will be hoarded by the public, as it is in North China, and the Hua Xing currency, which is generally regarded as having no cash backing, will be the first to be abandoned by the public. It is also reported that the owners of several restaurants in Hongkou are being

forced with counterfeit money

to pay the bill by Japanese customers. According to one of them, "We have no choice but to accept the currency. We know they (Japanese customers) will pay with counterfeit money when they come to eat." According to Chinese sources, it is reported that, according to reliable sources, Hua Xing Bank absorbed 600,000 yuan of legal tender on its first day of operation, and counterfeit currency is accepted at a 60% discount in the occupied areas. The North-China Daily News reports that a reporter asked the manager of a major foreign bank in Shanghai yesterday (the 24th) whether the bank would accept Hua Xing banknotes. The reply was that if a customer produced

this kind of banknote

, the cashier would refuse it. This shows a glimpse of the situation. The other foreign bankers that the reporter met yesterday unanimously stated that they would refuse to handle this new currency. According to one banker, the foreign banks mentioned by the Japanese spokesperson as handling the new currency were probably the six Japanese banks operating here. It was rumored in banking circles yesterday that one yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 160 yuan of new currency. If

this is true

, then exchanging foreign currency for Hua Xing banknotes at one of the six Japanese banks would be very profitable. However, according to detailed inquiries made yesterday, if there is new currency circulating, the amount is temporarily very small. After falling in value against legal tender for ten consecutive days, the yen showed a slight increase yesterday on the Shanghai market. Yesterday afternoon, the exchange shops in this port sold yen at 94.5 fen or 95 fen per yuan of legal tender, compared to a market price of 90 fen the day before. However, foreign exchange circles anticipate that the yen seems to have a

continued decline

trend. The opening market price of the yen yesterday morning was 91.5 fen, after which there was an upward trend, increasing to 93 fen, 94.5 fen, and 95 fen at noon. It is reported that the rise in the yen exchange rate was due to many foreigners buying yen to cover travel expenses, resulting in increased demand. A ship bound for Japan is scheduled to set sail from here today (the 25th), so the upward trend of the yen may be a temporary phenomenon. The above figures are the

selling ratio

, but the buying ratio is only one fen less. Overall, the yen is still following a downward trend, as the yen's value used to be 1.3 yuan of legal tender. In addition to the many reasons mentioned above for the decline in the yen exchange rate, according to recent Chinese sources, some people are selling yen in bulk to buy legal tender, because a certain bank wants to use legal tender as a reserve for its banknotes. This is also one of the reasons. The yen exchanged daily by exchange shops reaches

3 million yuan

. Seeing this as a good business, small exchange shops have sprung up one after another. The Chinese side calls this the "golden age" of exchange shops. The gradual restoration of traffic between the occupied areas using Japanese currency and Shanghai has resulted in this situation.

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the yen was more stable on the foreign exchange market this morning (the 25th). At the opening, the buying price of 100 yen was 96.5 yuan of legal tender, and the selling price was 96.9 yuan. However, by noon, the exchange rate had fallen by 2 yuan. Exchange shops on Szechuan Road bought 100 yen for 94.5 yuan of legal tender and sold the same amount of yen for 94.9 yuan of legal tender today.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Writes to the Rice Industry, Restoring the Price Evaluation Committee; Various Rice Industry Groups Will Hold a Meeting for Joint Discussion; The Previously Set Price Limit for National Rice Has Become Invalid

Although there are occasional reports of restrictions on the export of rice from the rice-producing areas in the Jiang-Zhe-Wan occupied areas, the source of national rice continues uninterrupted, being transported to Shanghai in separate loads on civilian boats, steamers, and trains. Moreover, with the approaching of the Yellow Plum season, rice stored in various rice warehouses is prone to decay and rot, and various grain merchants are rushing to release their stocks, resulting in an oversupply of spot goods in the bean and rice market, causing people to be pessimistic. There is indeed a trend of supply exceeding demand. The opening price for top-grade white rice yesterday morning was 17.34 yuan, a decrease of 0.23 yuan from the previous day. Order has gradually been restored, transactions are gradually becoming standardized, prices are gradually stabilizing, and there is no concern about the overall food supply for the people.

The previously set price limit has become invalid

Since the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee resolved to voluntarily disband, there has been much confusion in the outside world, with various rumors circulating, some saying that the set price limit has been cancelled, and others saying that the set price limit remains in effect. A reporter from the New Life News met with Mr. Fu Qian'geng, the Director of the Market Management Committee, yesterday, who said that market transactions had exceeded the price limit set during the last market, and although the Evaluation Committee repeatedly issued orders to strictly enforce the price limit, it was ultimately ineffective due to limited authority, and was forced to voluntarily announce its disbandment. The order to limit the price of top-grade white rice to 15 yuan has naturally become invalid. However, the Market Committee will still adhere to its purpose of stabilizing prices to maintain the food supply for the people.

Restore the organization to maintain the food supply for the people

After the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee reported the process of its voluntary disbandment to the authorities of the two concessions, it received a reply from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession yesterday, stating that "We have received your letter. Your efforts to maintain the food supply for the people are deeply appreciated. We hope that you will restore the original organization to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai." A reporter from the New Life News specifically visited Mr. Chen Ziyi, a leader in the bean and rice industry, yesterday. According to him, after receiving the reply from the Shanghai Municipal Council ordering the restoration of the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee organization, the Bean and Rice Industry Association will invite various rice industry groups to jointly discuss the matter, but the date has not yet been decided.

National rice arrives in abundance, supply exceeds demand

The source of national rice from various places has indeed increased in recent days. According to estimates, an average of 15 or 16 boats arrive from the river downstream every day, and 7,000 or 8,000 bags are transported to Shanghai by train and steamer. Moreover, various out-of-town traders are still trying their best to purchase. Although there are reports of export restrictions in Suzhou, supplies continue to arrive one after another. Yesterday, 7,000 or so bags of Nos. 5 and 6 cars were transported from various places to Shanghai, but sales in the market were scarce. According to people in the industry, there is no need to worry about the food supply problem in this city. Recently, the retail sales departments of various rice shops have seen sluggish business, showing a trend of supply exceeding demand, and rice prices are falling back, with a rather sharp downward trend.

Japanese puppet control has not yet been confirmed

After the rice industry groups have made every effort to dredge the source of supply and stabilize people's hearts, rice prices in Shanghai have been declining day by day. If efforts are made for some time, it will not be difficult to achieve a balance between production and sales, or even to return to the limited price of 15 yuan. However, just as the rice market situation is encountering a wave of turbulence and turning into a relatively calm state, it is suddenly rumored in the market that the Japanese puppets have established a "Rice and Grain Control Bureau" in the Fengji Rice Industry Wharf area of ​​Nanshi in the occupied area, and will soon forcibly implement control, and collect a "transit tax" on rice transported from various production areas in southern Huangpu to Shanghai. All rice arriving will be sold through the "puppet bureau". The houses of the former Xinchang Rice Factory have been illegally occupied as the "bureau" site. However, the various industry groups are paying close attention to whether this rumor is true or whether it has other effects, and are currently sending people to conduct on-the-spot investigations. If such an illegal organization is indeed created, the industry will vow not to cooperate with it. However, after this kind of rumor was introduced into the market, it hit the minds of the hoarders, who originally planned to sell off in large quantities, but suddenly tightened up, pretending to be coy and unwilling to let go easily. As a result, people's hearts became uneasy, and the number of transactions decreased accordingly. However, the overall market price was fortunately unaffected.

The second batch of foreign rice is being negotiated

Some rice shops in this city have ordered 2,000 tons of Saigon foreign rice (equivalent to more than 20,000 bags), and the Dafu Foreign Company in charge has telegraphed the production area to start shipping to Shanghai in early June. It is reported that other companies in the same industry are also raising funds to order a second batch of foreign rice, the amount of which is said to be between 2,500 tons. Procedures such as negotiating orders are underway and will soon be successful. Once a deal is reached, the delivery date to Shanghai will be from the end of June to the beginning of July.

### The Japanese Side Guarantees the Property of Lun Chang; British Sailors Have Withdrawn; The Japanese Side Still Needs to Protest to Britain; The Factory Hopes to Resume Work Soon

The North-China Daily News reports that labor disputes occurred at the Shantou Bailianjing Printing Factory of the British-owned Lun Chang Company. A platoon of armed British sailors was dispatched to the factory on Tuesday to protect British lives and property. Subsequently, the Japanese military authorities guaranteed to officials of the British Consulate and the factory owner that they would be responsible for protecting the property. The British sailors withdrew from the factory yesterday (the 24th). According to a member of the British Consulate yesterday, the remaining British sailors will definitely withdraw this morning (the 25th). At the same time, at the Lun Chang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, yesterday

The strike continues

British sailors protecting the property were relieved by a platoon of British soldiers from the Seaforth Highlanders in the morning. It is reported that the British and Japanese consulate authorities are negotiating the withdrawal of British troops today, but the step of withdrawing troops will only be taken after the Japanese side guarantees to protect the factory's property and British employees. It is reported that the Lun Chang Yarn Weaving Factory went on strike on Saturday morning due to the dismissal of a craftsman in the engine room, and the electricity supply was cut off, causing the factory to be

Forced to close

After a British employee was beaten by strikers, it was decided to request a platoon of British sailors to go to the factory. It was learned yesterday that labor unrest occurred at the Bailianjing Printing Factory, which directly threatened the lives and property of British people. A platoon of armed sailors from the British ship HMS Falcon was dispatched to the printing factory to be stationed on Tuesday afternoon. On the same day, the French Consulate authorities contacted the Japanese Consulate authorities and notified them that if the Japanese military authorities controlling the area

Guarantee protection

Of the factory, the British sailors would withdraw immediately. The Japanese military authorities gave this guarantee, and a unit of the sailors left the factory, with the rest withdrawing this morning. According to the Japanese view, the British sailors only agreed to withdraw after the Japanese army approached the factory on all sides. This statement was denied by British personnel yesterday. It is said that although the British sailors will withdraw after a peaceful resolution with the Japanese side, some sailors will still be stationed at the factory today. Japanese sources also said that British sailors

Landed immediately

Without Japanese permission. The Japanese side has lodged a strong protest with the British Consul-General. A Lieutenant Colonel of the Japanese Army Liaison Officer in Central China, accompanied by a certain staff officer of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, went to Pudong yesterday morning to monitor the withdrawal of British soldiers. The British authorities requested the Japanese Consul-General to arrange for a team of police from the "Shanghai Special City Government" to patrol the Bailianjing Printing Factory on Tuesday. The Japanese side has notified the "Shanghai City Government" of this matter. The Japanese

Consul-General

When the authorities lodged a strong protest yesterday morning, a team of Japanese troops approached the factory on all sides and set up machine gun positions. According to a communiqué issued by the Japanese Army in Central China at 1:00 PM yesterday, after the Japanese Army decided to withdraw the British sailors who had landed, the British authorities agreed to withdraw the British sailors. The Japanese military authorities decided yesterday morning to take measures to protect the lives and property of British people when the strike situation disrupted peace and order. The Japanese authorities

Took this action

Its purpose is to maintain peace and order in the area, and not to mediate this dispute between labor and management. When the Japanese spokesperson answered a reporter's question at a press conference yesterday, he said that initially, there was a place in Bailianjing where British and Japanese troops had an armed conflict. Thanks to the amicable attitude of the British authorities, no conflict occurred. When asked if the Japanese side had issued an ultimatum to the British army, the spokesperson replied no. He also said that according to the Japanese view, there are now stationed in the Lujiazui factory the Seaforth Highlanders.

A team of British soldiers

Although there is no place for armed conflict there, the British side has no right to send troops to land in the Japanese-occupied area. When asked why there was a risk of armed conflict in the Bailianjing Printing Factory, while there was no risk in the Lujiazui factory, given that the Japanese side opposed any foreign troops landing in the occupied area, the spokesperson replied that the Bailianjing factory is located inland, while the Lujiazui factory is on the banks of the Huangpu River. The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury also reported that British merchants' two factories in Pudong, Lun Chang, went on strike, and British sailors and soldiers were dispatched

Go to station

British and Japanese authorities then conducted discussions, and Japanese authorities guaranteed that they would protect the lives and property of British people in the two factories. British sailors and soldiers then withdrew from the two factories this morning (the 25th). The Chinese Shen Bao, which is run by the Japanese army, carried purely inaccurate news, saying that British Marine Corps soldiers with machine guns, box cannons, and hand grenades fired at Lun Chang workers on May 20. The Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, which is run by the Japanese army, also carried

Absurd news

It is said that Lun Chang Company will hire Jewish and White Russian workers to replace the striking Chinese people, which is completely impossible. It is hoped that work can be resumed soon with the current employees. As for the British Marine Corps firing guns, it is completely groundless. There are currently no British Marine Corps in Shanghai (except for one or two people in the Naval Office), and the British army is not equipped with box cannons.

### The British Army Commander Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

### Japanese Warships Break into Taotou, Dinghai; Japanese Aircraft Circle for Reconnaissance; Japanese Troops Have Not Withdrawn from Daishan

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with relevant parties, a Japanese warship suddenly broke into the waters of Taotou, Dinghai on the morning of the 23rd, and then withdrew immediately. It came again in the afternoon and retreated after a while. At the same time, two Japanese aircraft also came to the skies above Dinghai on the 20th of this month, circling for reconnaissance, causing extreme anxiety among the people. Prices have been rising sharply, especially for rice. As for the local produce of fish and seafood, sales are sluggish due to poor exports, and fish merchants are selling at reduced prices.

Japanese troops have not withdrawn from Daishan

People from Dinghai living in Shanghai do not pay much attention to the matter of Japanese troops landing on Dalangzui (not deer) in Daishan, because Daishan is 100 li away from Dinghai County by water, and the land routes are not connected. There is also the interruption of Lanxiu Mountain. However, the island is an area of fish and salt, and the market is quite hot.

Commonplace and not worthy of attention

As of yesterday morning, Shanghai had not yet received a report that Japanese troops had withdrawn from the island. It is now learned that their occupied area is in Gaoting, Pumen, and Tianshan in the southern part of Daishan. However, only police are stationed on the island to maintain order, and there are no troops. Moreover, such actions by Japanese troops on the island have been seen many times before and are not worthy of attention.

### After the Abnormal Development of the Concession, the Overview of Public Utilities; The Number of Passengers on Trams and Public Buses Has Increased Sharply; Telephone Creates a Post-War Record; Electricity Drops Sharply; Water and Gas Consumption Have Increased

In the Shanghai concession area after the war, all industries have developed abnormally, and the population has increased sharply. Various public utilities have gradually returned to their pre-war state. However, after repeated negotiations in the Hongkou area, trams and public buses have not yet been restored. The following is an overview of public utilities last year:

Public Bus

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company was exceptionally busy last year due to the extraordinary times. As a result of the war, residents in the concession gathered, and the number of passengers and mileage of the company's buses increased sharply. In 1937, the mileage was 4,472,395 miles, and the number of passengers carried was 35,803,329. In 1938, the mileage was 5,240,675 miles, and the number of passengers carried was 57,813,484. However, the operation of public buses in the area north of Suzhou Creek and east of the Garden Bridge has been temporarily suspended since August of the previous year and has not been restored as of the end of last year. Regarding routes, there have been only minor changes. For example, a new route was opened in December last year, called Route 16, and Route 14 was extended to the corner of Daxi Road and Dunxin Road.

Tram Company

The Shanghai Electric Construction Company continued to negotiate throughout last year, hoping to resume passenger traffic north of Suzhou Creek, but it is still impossible to predict when it will be realized. The British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Phillips, has come forward to negotiate this matter. A total of 15 new trolleybuses were added to the fleet last year. The chassis of the new cars were shipped from the UK, and the bodies were built by the General Factory on Baker Road. The factory was affected by the war and only resumed work at the beginning of last year. The Hongkou Huishan parking lot was once banned from entering. After negotiation, it was allowed to be used for parking again, but the number of vehicles parked was limited. The operating results on December 21, 1938 showed that the vehicles traveled a total of 8,468,426 miles and carried a total of 99,204,164 passengers, which was an increase compared to the previous year but a decrease compared to 1936.

Gas

The Shanghai Gas Company, in terms of the general situation in the area, was able to continue to increase the amount of gas sold last year. However, due to the fall in the price of Chinese currency against British gold, the price of materials shipped from abroad and coal produced in China increased, and it was necessary to obtain approval to charge a surcharge. The operating results for last year were: 723,068,700 cubic feet of gas supplied to households, 1,432,356 cubic feet of gas supplied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for public street lights, and 15,396,100 cubic feet of gas used by the company's workshops. The total amount of gas used that can be verified is 739,897,156 cubic feet. The amount of coal gas produced was 734,565,000 cubic feet, and the amount of water gas produced was 71,594,000 cubic feet. The total amount of gas produced was 806,159,000 cubic feet.

At the end of 1937, he was commissioned as the commander of the U.S. battleship Maryland. He stepped down in 1938 and was recently appointed to succeed Rear Admiral Bladen as the commander of the Yangtze River Patrol Fleet. When reporters visited him on the President Coolidge yesterday, Rear Admiral Glassford said that he

### Postal Transportation Association's Recommendations for Parcel Delivery: To Avoid Congestion and Facilitate Acceptance; Parcel Service to Eastern Zhejiang Fully Restored

In view of the traffic congestion in various places after the outbreak of the war and the difficulties in transportation, the Shanghai Postal Transportation Industry Association, although the Shanghai Postal Administration has tried its best to transport parcels from various places, they have been stopped from time to time due to the congestion of senders and the inability to load them. In order to seek proper solutions, the association held an extraordinary general meeting of members at the China Hotel at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the matter. The results were: (1) urging all member companies to abide by the order when going to the post office to send parcels, so as to avoid congestion; (2) soliciting non-member companies to complete membership procedures as soon as possible, so as to unify steps and increase strength; (3) suggesting that the Shanghai Postal Administration allocate the acceptance of large and small parcels on a daily basis, so as to avoid congestion and facilitate acceptance.

### French Mail Ship Searched in Hong Kong Waters; Japanese Sailors Thoroughly Search the Aramis; Shipowner Protests in Vain and Will Lodge a Serious Protest; British Mail on the Rampura Seized

The French mail ship Aramis was searched by the Japanese Navy at 2:00 PM on the 24th, 17 miles from Hong Kong, following the British ship Rampura. According to information obtained by the French authorities in Shanghai on the evening of the 24th, the ship was sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai on that day when it was suddenly searched by the Japanese Navy 17 miles from Hong Kong. Following the search of the British Great Britain Company mail ship Rampura by a Japanese Navy team in the morning, the same fate was imposed on the French mail ship Aramis. According to reports, at 2:00 PM that afternoon, a Japanese warship approached the Aramis and ordered it to stop. A team of sailors, led by a naval officer, boarded the ship and conducted a search, which lasted about an hour before stopping. At that time, the ship protested the illegal boarding and search by the Japanese Navy. After receiving the information on the afternoon of the 24th, the French naval authorities in Shanghai have decided to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese naval authorities. According to private sources, when the Japanese Navy boarded the British mail ship Rampura, they took away three bags of mail from the British War Office. It is also learned that the French mail ship Aramis was sailing from Marseille, France, to Shanghai. After stopping at Hong Kong harbor for six hours on the morning of the 24th, it sailed to Shanghai, only to be searched by the Japanese Navy 17 miles from Hong Kong at 2:00 PM that afternoon. According to the company, the ship telegraphed that it would arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 PM today. The French naval authorities have reported the incident to the Paris authorities.

### Important British-Owned Textile Mill Officially Returned by the Japanese After Being Occupied for Seventeen Months; Machines Being Calibrated and Work to Commence Soon

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," it received a letter today (the 25th) from the Sinchang Machine Engineering Co., Ltd., stating that the important textile mill in Caojiadu has been returned to its British owner after being occupied by the Japanese army for seventeen months. The letter briefly stated the process as follows: The former Zhendai Textile Mill and Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Caojiadu, now owned by two British companies, have been returned to their legal owners after being occupied by the Japanese army for seventeen months. It is verified that the two factories were occupied by the Japanese army in December 1937, and the British owners were forced to withdraw.

The machines are now being calibrated, and it is hoped that work will commence soon.

### French Concession Pig Market Restored to Its Original State

Since the "Livestock Market Organization," the control of fresh pork led to a strike by the meat industry in the isolated island. Subsequently, Liu Peilin, (who was previously sentenced to probation by the Second Special Court for encroaching on pigs), Liu Jinpei, Liu Peiyuan, Zhang Guorong, Shen A'er, and Yeh Kaihua (who was sentenced to long-term imprisonment for theft) and others conspired to carry out small-scale control in the two special districts, exploiting meat merchants, causing most meat merchants to remain closed. Xu Huanwen, Wang Tongxing, Wang Guocai and others in Hongkou were allowed to set up separate slaughterhouses, which were the most monopolistic, thus affecting the meat industry to a great extent. The concession authorities cared about the people's livelihoods and negotiated on their own by the Public Works Bureau and the Directorate-General, which led to the joint promotion of Lu Wenqing to take charge by the slaughtering industry, and to maintain the original fresh pig market on Route de P. Robert, French Concession. Yesterday, it officially began to restore its original state. The Sungsan Road Police protected Lu Wenqing at the slaughterhouse on Route Mengtigny (i.e. the Cattle Slaughtering Company) to receive slaughtering. At the same time, the fresh pig market was officially opened. However, when taking over, Liu Peilin and others were instigated by someone to gather a small number of Jiangyin butchers to harass and obstruct, attempting to hinder the performance of official duties. Liu Peilin and A Gen were arrested by the Chinese and Western detectives in the arena, and then it was successfully completed. From then on, there is no fear of interruption in the supply of pork in the city.

### Japanese Troops Attempt to Attack Tangkou; Heavy Casualties; More Than Forty Japanese Soldiers Drowning While Swimming; Most Shot and Drowned in the River

The Japanese Naval Headquarters dispatched two small warships with more than 100 naval marines on the morning of the 23rd, departing from Minhang in an attempt to attack the guerrillas in the Tangkou area. When the Japanese warships sailed into Tangkou, they were suddenly attacked by the Fan Gencai unit of the guerrillas. The Japanese troops struggled to the death, sneaking ashore under cover all the way. They were suddenly surrounded by Fan's unit on three sides and engaged in a bayonet charge. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand and fled in all directions, abandoning their weapons and swimming to board the warships. Fan Du immediately took the opportunity to use intensive machine gun fire to sweep the more than 40 Japanese soldiers swimming in the water, most of whom were shot and drowned in the river. The remaining Japanese troops took the original warship and retreated in a panic. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in this battle.

### Foreign Merchant Ships Detained; Redesignated National Flags; Verbal Notice from Japanese Naval Officer; New Developments in Negotiations for Detained Ships

More than 20 Portuguese merchant ships, including Tang Bei, Tang Lu, Tang Qiao, Meta, Hailong, Lishi, Fulu, Dade, Baode, Fade, and Greek ship Livorto, German ships Tian, Weijin, etc., have been successively detained by the Japanese side and moored on buoys in the Yangshupu River. All the flags of their respective countries originally flown by the ships were forcibly removed by the Japanese side and replaced with Japanese flags. Although the consulates of the respective countries in Shanghai have repeatedly negotiated separately, they have not been released to date. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter's investigation from the shipping industry yesterday, the detained ships received verbal notice from Japanese naval officers the day before, saying that the ships' original national flags are now allowed to be re-hung. After receiving the notice, the ships immediately reported to their respective companies and simultaneously hoisted their original national flags. According to observations in the shipping industry, the detention of the ships has been negotiated repeatedly, but has not been resolved, and seems to be in a stalemate. The move today may indicate new developments in the detained ship case recently.

After the National Army moved west, Xu and the stranded soldiers participated in the work of the Sixth Brigade in Western Shanghai. Xu served as the captain of the squadron and the adjutant of the brigade headquarters, so everyone called him Adjutant Xu.

After Xu joined the Japanese side, he often led plainclothes pseudo-police to search everywhere, raping, looting, and doing everything. He also brutally killed innocent villagers. Now, the families of the victims have reported to the Japanese Military Police Department. The squad leader of the military police, Takeshita Bo, detained Xu and sent him to the Jin Gu Military Police Headquarters for questioning. It is now heard that Xu has been executed by the Japanese side.

### Major Explosion in the Nanshi Area, Rumored to be from the Gaochang Temple Arsenal, Another Account Claims it was the Bombing of a Sunken Ship at the 16th Wharf

Yesterday, at approximately 3:30 PM, a deafening explosion suddenly occurred in the Nanshi area. The loud noise reverberated throughout Shanghai, startling all residents. After investigation by reporters, it was learned that the explosion occurred on Luban Road in Nanshi. It was a large bomb left behind by the retreating Chinese army. It is unknown why it suddenly detonated yesterday.

Another report states that since the Gaochang Temple Arsenal, Steel Mill, and Jiangnan Naval Dockyard in Nanshi were seized by the Japanese, they have been using a large number of ignorant workers to manufacture or repair various Japanese firearms, artillery shells, and naval vessels. Yesterday afternoon at 3:40 PM, a portion of the factory building where gunpowder was stored suddenly exploded, with thick smoke billowing out and a tremendous boom. The explosion could be clearly heard in the southwest area of the French Concession. In addition to destroying all of the gunpowder and the factory building, numerous Japanese and Chinese workers were killed or injured. However, due to the strict security measures imposed by the Japanese army after the incident, workers in other sections were suppressed and searched, and movement was restricted. The details remain unclear, but it is rumored that it was caused by the activities of a Chinese plainclothes team infiltrating the area.

Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, explosives were placed again at the blockade line of the Youjiang 16th Wharf, causing a loud explosion when bombing the sunken ship "Luoyang Maru." All of the ship's cabins and deck railings were completely destroyed by the explosion and lifted by cranes. Therefore, only the hull of the "Luoyang Maru" remains undestroyed. It is possible that the widespread report of a loud noise in the Nanshi area at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon was a misunderstanding of the sound of the ship bombing.

Yesterday at 3:15 PM, a tremendous explosion occurred in the Nanshi area, followed by a plume of black smoke that shot straight into the sky, dissipating after a long time. Upon closer observation, it seemed to be near the Gaochang Temple. Judging by the intensity of the explosion and the density of the smoke, it appeared to be a military ammunition depot. However, because the area is under Japanese military control, the true situation remains unknown.

### Modern Woman Attempts Suicide in the Dongfang Hotel, Remains Unconscious as of Last Night, Young Man Visits but Refuses to Reveal the Truth

In room 451 on the fourth floor of the New Dongfang Hotel on Guangdong Road and Yuqiaqing Road, a modern woman from Shaoxing named Tang Hui, also known as Tang Zhang, 37 years old, with a beautiful appearance, for unknown reasons, developed suicidal thoughts.

Although the detectives stationed at the hospital questioned him in detail, the young man stubbornly refused to tell the truth, claiming ignorance. The police station is currently investigating the matter in detail.

### Official of the Special Second Court Admonishes Fighters and is Beaten, Files a Charge of Assault Against the Gatekeeper

At 6:00 AM on the morning of this month, two brothers from Ningbo, Lin Xinbo and Lin Shubo, hired a vehicle to transport three suitcases to Lane 347, Avenue Albert in the French Concession. As they were about to drive into the lane, they were stopped by Yang Shao Gui (23 years old, from Shandong), the gatekeeper of No. 352, employed by the Belgian resident of No. 3. This led to a verbal dispute. At that moment, two other patrol officers arrived and used force to assault the Lin brothers. Peng Dayuan, an Anhui native working in the Special Second Court, passed by and stepped forward to mediate. The officers, without discrimination, grabbed Peng and beat him violently, causing injuries. Peng immediately submitted a petition to the Procuratorate of the Special Second Court, requesting an examination of the injuries. He also filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against Yang Shao Gui, the gatekeeper of No. 352, for assault, and attached a civil suit seeking compensation for medical expenses and losses. The court, based on the petition, ordered Judge Jiang Liquan of the Second Criminal Division to convene a hearing yesterday morning. First, the plaintiff, Peng Dayuan, recounted the incident of being beaten while admonishing the fighters. The defendant, Yang Shao Gui, testified that he was acting on his master's orders to prevent anyone from entering the lane, and that they attacked him first, leading to a mutual fight. After reviewing the testimonies, the court ordered the closing arguments and announced the conclusion. The verdict is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 29th. The defendant was released on bail of 100 yuan. If he could not provide bail, he would be detained.

### Butchers Petition After the Manager is Replaced, Alleging Illegal Coercion by the Slaughtering Company, Requesting the French Municipal Council to Stop it Immediately

The 46 slaughtering businesses in the French Concession, including Yong Yu Mingji, due to the Slaughtering Company's unwarranted removal of Liu Peilin, the manager elected by the industry association, and the unauthorized appointment of Lu Wenqing as his replacement, are greatly angered. They have jointly petitioned the Municipal Council, requesting a stop to the illegal removal and the reinstatement of Liu Peilin to his original position. The original petition is recorded below: "Petition Regarding the Forced Removal by the French Slaughtering Company of Manager (i.e., pig manager) Liu Peilin's position, causing widespread anger. We earnestly request a swift cessation of this action and a restoration of the original situation to appease the hearts of the butchers and avoid the escalation of disputes. Liu Peilin, the manager of the Slaughtering Company, was elected by all the butchers in April of the 27th year of the Republic and had a three-year contract for the entrusted management of pigs. Since taking office, he has diligently served and been consistently trusted by the industry. Previously, due to the conspiracy of a few unscrupulous individuals, we jointly submitted a petition to your esteemed Bureau, clearly stating the facts on record. However, the Slaughtering Company suddenly resorted to oppression and, on the 24th of this month, forcibly removed Liu Peilin from his position as manager. This is illogical and has caused shock and anger among all the butchers. Liu Peilin's position was elected by the public and he has committed no wrongdoing. How could the Slaughtering Company dare to overstep its authority and remove him so abruptly? This illegal coercion is alarming. Even if we assume that the company deems it necessary to replace the manager, the selection of a successor should be determined by the butchers' election. How could they make such a special move, defying public opinion? Therefore, we jointly submit this petition to your esteemed Bureau, earnestly requesting your attention and swift correction and cessation of this action. We ask that Liu Peilin be reinstated to his original position as manager to maintain the original situation and appease the public, thereby avoiding the escalation of disputes. We also request a prompt response for the benefit of both public morals and convenience. Respectfully submitted to the French Municipal Council Superintendent and General Manager."

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: I read in your May 22nd report on the Animal Protection Association that animals are being inhumanely slaughtered at the Caojiadu Slaughterhouse, which is appalling. In March, the Animal Protection Association sent someone to contact our company, stating that all slaughtered animals must first be stunned with an electric shock gun before being cut with a knife. Our company has repeatedly explained that our current slaughtering method is the same as that of other major slaughterhouses, and we have politely asked them to start by discussing and promoting this with other major slaughterhouses first. They have always complied. Unexpectedly, the Association has described it as inhumane behavior, which is a misunderstanding. We are deeply concerned that this will confuse the public. Please publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the matter. Respectfully, Shanghai Hexing Slaughtering Company, May 25th.

### News from Nanyang

— Yu Dafu

Brother Lai Ti:

All your letters and manuscripts have been received. However, the literary bi-monthly magazine that I am editing has been delayed and its plans changed due to printing difficulties. Originally, it was planned to be published in mid-March, but the printing was not completed in time, and the manuscripts from Chinese friends were incomplete, so it was delayed by a month. However, by May, various obstacles still could not be removed, so it has now been decided to publish it on June 1st. Furthermore, for the convenience of printing, distribution, and binding, it has been decided not to publish it independently, but to include it as a supplement to the "Singapore Bi-monthly" which is already being printed here, occupying one-third or two-fifths of the entire publication, with a total of about 20,000 words per issue. Many people from Shanghai have sent manuscripts, such as Mr. Xu Yu, Ms. Wu Yihong, and a gentleman from the "Great Evening News," etc. However, because I am busy, I have not replied to them. After this letter arrives, please ask "Free Talk" to publish this information so that everyone knows about the magazine.

Secondly, the situation here is that because we are located between Europe and Asia, we are as concerned about the European situation as we are about the war of resistance in our motherland. Since the announcement of the German-Italian alliance, the danger to Danzig and the Polish Corridor, and the resignation of Litvinov, there has been daily propaganda about air defense and stockpiling food. After the implementation of the British conscription system and the announcement of volunteer recruitment, there is also a very strong wartime atmosphere here. But from our perspective, having been through several life-and-death situations in the midst of gunfire, we believe that these are ultimately just a form of exercise. Regardless of whether a European war will break out soon, air raids on the Malay Peninsula and naval battles in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea will ultimately not occur, and are indeed impossible. The reason is that China's bloody war is more than enough to block the flames of war in this direction. The advances and retreats at Nanchang, and the future battles in western Hunan and Hubei, serve as a shield here.

The war of resistance in our motherland will not be affected by the world war or rumors of peace talks. The last madness of the militarists, like a dying flash of light, will inevitably erupt soon, but the "golden city" of the Northwest and the "iron wall" of the Southwest will probably be even harder to shake than Yue Fei's army.

Finally, I would like to report to you on some of my personal matters. From the perspective of personal blows, I am probably one of the most severely affected by this war of resistance. Both my old and new residences have been destroyed, my old mother died for her country, and my collection of books for thirty years has been stolen, compounded by a series of family misfortunes. If this had happened in peacetime, I would probably have already left this world, but at this critical moment for our nation and country, I have instead been tempered by these blows. I have forgotten all personal feelings, individual interests, and reputation. I have become like a well-trained wooden chicken for the war of resistance. To help you in your emergency, I have done what I could for you today amidst my busy schedule. After this letter arrives, I only hope that you will send me a short reply, telling me that what you urgently needed has been delivered. The payment for manuscripts here cannot be advanced, and the magazine has not yet been published, so I feel very uneasy about the many friends in Shanghai who urgently need money. But I have no other choice but to ask everyone to wait another month.

Dafu, May 8th

### European Spring Tour

— Translated from the "Millard's Review"

### Before and After Going to the Countryside

— Zhang Zhenshan

－Fragments of a Draftee's Life

A faint light reflected off the paper window, dimly revealing the outlines of the room's furnishings. Throwing back the blanket, I rubbed my drowsy eyes and quickly climbed out of bed.

Pushing open the window, I saw that the dimness of the lingering night had disappeared into the clear gray of the morning light. Comrade Li excitedly stretched out his thumb and spoke in his Hubei dialect:

"The weather must be good today, and the propaganda work in the countryside will definitely be smooth! Prepare quickly!"

Ignoring the commotion, everyone busily carried their military blankets and bundles on their backs. A group of people, their faces flushed, straightened their chests and walked out of the bedroom, running into the parade ground.

The sky had already put on its silver-gray coat, and the morning stars had faded their last rays of light. The morning breeze carried a cool breath, assailing our thin uniforms; the dew on the grass blades moistened our canvas sneakers. The sounds of bugles and whistles rang tightly, like a fire, burning strongly in everyone's heart.

In neat rows, under the coach's strong and serious tone, we were divided into four propaganda teams and sixteen squads; after dividing the routes and areas, he repeated the propaganda outline for the National Spiritual Mobilization; finally, he encouraged us, saying: "Once you go to the countryside, you must increase the strength of the war of resistance in the countryside. I hope you will achieve the expected goal, so that every farmer or shepherd can understand the effectiveness of the National Mobilization and their own obligations; to give the aggressors a serious blow..."

His words ended when the bugle call for the second departure began.

Starting out: we walked onto the narrow paths; turned into winding dark alleys; in the streets, the streetlights flickered with their remaining light, and sleepy shop assistants were taking down the door planks... Passing through the city gate, passing through the electric fence, we headed for the countryside.

On the road, the sun had already climbed above the horizon, and the bloody red, soft, fresh, and strong light shone obliquely, like a golden veil, dragging down to the edge of the earth. The colorful clouds surrounding the morning sun adorned half the sky with extraordinary splendor, illuminating the crisscrossing fields, ridges, and vegetable gardens; the gentle breath of morning permeated the air.

Calling out, the smoke from the chimneys on the houses floated thread by thread in the sky.

Looking at those thatched huts, looking at that light smoke, our active hearts became more unrestrained and more vigorous! After passing through a village, we left a squad behind, waving a small flag, and began to preach to the farmers: -- National Spiritual Mobilization; knowledge of air defense in war-torn rural areas; basic skills in guerrilla warfare.

They all listened attentively to our slow explanation. More and more people gathered: old uncles and old grandmothers all squinted their eyes; the children all waved their little fists.

When we finished speaking, a group of farmers raised their voices and let out a lion-like roar:

"We must cooperate with the National Army; we must pick up our iron hoes and nail rakes, aim them, and chop! We want freedom, we want to live, we want to eat. Get up and work quickly!"

This was the response given to our propaganda team. This sound shook the village, shook the fields, and also shook the distant valleys.

### Underground Fire

— Xing

Some people are afraid of fire. Birds and beasts are especially afraid of fire. When they see fire, if they cannot extinguish it, they can only flee quickly to avoid being burned to death. If they can extinguish it, they would of course be willing to do everything in their power to eliminate it.

Fire certainly comes from the sky, but to avoid the destruction of those who fear it, it will also go underground. Thus, the fire of today, we see it hiding underground, causing the world to temporarily cease its fierce and resounding burning and destruction of all filth. The triumph of the destroyers is naturally imaginable.

Originally, fire is lively, clever, and also intense. God's Holy Spirit is represented by it. It is unwilling to be easily sacrificed under the filthy water of the destroyers. It can temporarily lower its fierce flames; it can slightly restrain its angry steps. If pushed too hard, it can hide deep underground.

Underground, it found abundant coal, any fuel that could increase its power. Not only did it not die out, but it became even more intense. It constantly seeks opportunities to emerge, burning the hands, feet, and any part of the destroyers' bodies, melting the traces of any evil things on the ground. Once the time is ripe, it will erupt with a roar, shaking the heavens and the earth, and return to the earth.

Underground fire is a fact, and also a symbol. The righteous feelings of the world can be viewed as underground fire!

### Fame

— Wen Ge

Life is so ordinary! How short is human life? Some people are filled with emotion, unwilling to spend their lives silently. They frown and come up with a plan, feeling that they can accomplish something and leave a "name" in people's minds. Therefore, people have one more job... In addition to seeking profit, they also seek fame. Having a name can not only be known in one's time, but also be passed down to future generations, so that people will be in awe and terrified upon hearing it. It is a great thing to achieve both goals with one move.

Fame is dead, and to have fame, one must seek it. The methods of seeking it are nothing more than drilling, flattering, and praising. I am currently learning how to drill, flatter, and praise. The specific procedures are of course unspeakable. However, I have heard and seen some of the benefits of these methods after they are successful, so I might as well say them so that everyone can avoid some of the arduous journeys of hiding it in famous mountains.

Suppose your name can be known in your time, then everything will go smoothly for you, and you will always catch the wind. For example, if you are a writer famous throughout the country, that is really amazing. Not only are the readers amazed, but even the editors are completely prostrate. Therefore, people will snatch your articles like rare treasures, not to mention that the paper will be as expensive as in Luoyang. In this way, you can occasionally put on airs, dealing with a group of manuscript seekers in a reserved manner, in order to increase people's belief in your great name, until it reaches its peak. After that, even if you have bad works, you don't have to worry about not having a market.

The benefits of being a famous writer are not limited to this, of course there are others. If you are tired of being a writer and want to change careers, it is very easy. You can be whatever you want, as long as you are in the mood.

Just as it is for writers, by extension, how can a wealthy merchant not use fame to widely collect profits? How can gentlemen like "Mr. Hua Fang" not use fame to jump onto the political stage? Fame has so many uses, so there are many people in the world who are busy for fame, and so there are people who shake their heads and wag their tails and say: "The use of fame is great!"

But people cannot avoid death. If you, the famous writer, die, I think it will definitely be different from ordinary people. People will not only mourn or commemorate you, but even the government will issue orders to commend you, write a biography, send it to the National History Museum, and issue some funeral expenses. All of these are because you are famous. As for what happens later, of course there are many benefits. Leaving aside others, your great name can always be passed down for billions of years with the records of history books and people's stories. So at that time, even though you are dead, you should still congratulate yourself, because there are thousands and millions of nameless "Ah Q"-style mediocre people, no one is telling their true story, but you are different from everyone else, that is truly as different as clouds and mud!

Extending this further, how can wealthy merchants and "Mr. Hua Wei"-type figures not rely on the power of fame to contend for posthumous glory?

Fame has so many benefits, great! It can benefit you during your lifetime and benefit your descendants. Gentlemen who love fame, why not come and join in!

But be careful not to be poisoned by the saying "People are afraid of becoming famous, and pigs are afraid of getting fat," because these are all threats from famous people who want to limit your arrival.

### Black Glasses and Ice-Cold Drinks

— Qieqi

Upon seeing this topic, one will immediately feel... summer has arrived.

The scorching sun shines on people, stimulating their eyes and causing them to sweat like rain. So people shout: "It's hot, it's hot!"

In order to protect their eyes from stimulation, people put on black glasses; in order to reduce sweating, people eat cold drinks like ice-cold snacks.

However, these two things, on the surface, belong to summer; in fact, they are not. Usually, these two things can be seen in spring, autumn, and winter. For example, if one has an eye disease, one naturally wears black glasses; when one feels "hot" in an indoor theater, one naturally eats ice-cold snacks.

"Wearing a fur coat in June" is said to be a joke, then isn't eating ice-cold snacks in winter also a joke? But jokes are jokes, existence is existence. Taking wearing black glasses as an example, the same principle applies. Wearing black glasses because of eye disease is for "protection," and wearing black glasses to avoid sunlight stimulation is also for "protection." Why is wearing black glasses considered summer? These are all incomprehensible questions. Incomprehensible things are jokes, and jokes are all incomprehensible.

However, we are very clear about this point. No matter what incomprehensible problem it is, as long as it exists, it always has its reason (whether right or wrong). And we wear black glasses and eat ice-cold snacks in summer, not only are they not incomprehensible, but they have "definite" reasons. These have all been said one by one above, so there is no need to be long-winded again.

However, because they are not "jokes," their reasons cannot be without question, which is quite true: wearing black glasses in summer is to avoid sunlight stimulation, and eating ice-cold snacks is to reduce sweating, but these are all caused by external blows, because there is no resistance, that is why these things are used as shields. As for usually wearing black glasses and eating ice-cold snacks, they are all due to internal desires. Lacking resistance and using these things as shields is really not allowed to exist.

Therefore, wearing black glasses and eating ice-cold snacks usually, because they are due to internal desires and are different from others, even though they are "jokes," they are quite fashionable and elegant; on the contrary, wearing black glasses and eating ice-cold snacks in summer is not fashionable, nor can it be called noble and elegant, it is nothing more than a display of weakness, a "joke."

### Finance: The Wealthy are Absorbing Again, Cash Rebound Suddenly Rises

Yesterday's black market situation for spot gold bullion had been falling for four consecutive days, but yesterday it suddenly rebounded, and the price has returned above the 2,110 yuan mark.

### Yarn and Cotton: Single Yarn's Momentum is Particularly Good - Prices Rise Again by $3.50 - 20-Count Yarn is Significantly Different from the Past - Spot Warehouse Orders are Approaching Fulfillment Day by Day

The yarn market was tired in the morning and stable in the afternoon, but the sales of 32-count single yarn were exceptionally brisk, and the factories lacked inventory. The demand from the Hong Kong and Shantou gangs continued unabated, resulting in a steady rise in market prices. However, the business of 20-count yarn was slightly sluggish, not as prosperous as in the past, so the market remained in a state of hesitation. However, some operators viewed the situation as hovering and not declining, and the concept of going long was still strong. However, the banking sector had tightened, with quotas of several hundred packages. It was found that the spot price on the market was soft, but the warehouse order price was increasingly firm, and the difference in value was approaching day by day, with only $6.50 separating them. When the bullish trend was at its sharpest in the past, the spot price was more than $10 higher than the warehouse order price. Judging from the overall trend, the market situation is still in a stable state, but the production of Japanese yarn and cloth is increasing day by day.

The current situation of yarn: When the market opened in the early morning, the atmosphere was tense due to reports of renewed tensions over the Gulangyu Concession, and investor sentiment loosened. In addition, the actual demand for 20-count yarn was also sluggish, and people were waiting and watching. The opening price fell by $2.50. The spot price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was $426, and the warehouse order price was $419. Soon after, some households who were given spot tickets to the door were eager to sell, but there were fewer buyers, and the false momentum was even greater, reaching $424. The warehouse order price was good, reaching $418. However, the warehouse prices of 32-count single yarn and 42-count double-strand yarn remained firm and strong. The closing price was slightly higher. The afternoon opening was flat, followed by the fact that the demand from the various gangs in South China was still not thin. The bulls returned to activity, and the market price rebounded by one or two yuan. The spot price of Shuang Ma reached $427.50, and the warehouse order price was $421. It was found that the total turnover for the whole day was 2,065 packages. The market price of Shuang Ma fell by $1, and the market price of Shuang Diqiu fell by $1.50. However, 32-count single yarn still rose by a huge $3.50. Today, 1,305 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou and 275 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:

Same Industry: 1,015; Shantou: 415; Hong Kong: 275

Inland: 140; Yunnan: 190; Sichuan: 30

Total: 2,065

The Japanese yarn market slightly recovered because the end of this month was approaching, and the shorts were covering their positions and hedging. Therefore, the market price slightly increased a step, but the actual demand was still smooth. As a result, the price of 20-count Yueqin for this month rose by two or three yuan, to a range of $357-358.

### US Cotton News is Good for the Bulls Indian Cotton Suffers Loss Again in Saigon Local Cotton Transactions Can Be Said to Have Disappeared

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was more active yesterday. Firstly, it was reported from Mumbai that prices had risen, and the industry was therefore quite excited. The Southern cotton market also rose, and spot market prices were also very firm. Later, due to purchases by the industry and speculators, news came from Washington that was favorable to the bulls, and the cotton market rose. Although it fell slightly due to news from Liverpool that prices had fallen, the New York closing price still rose by 8 to 13 pounds. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose sharply by four rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by three to five pounds. Converted to legal currency, cotton prices all rose, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton rising by $1.10 per dan, Indian cotton rising by $1.50, and Egyptian cotton rising by $0.20.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Because the goods arriving daily were very crowded, all parties were busy picking up the goods, so transactions were very quiet. There may be a better turnaround next week. The Italian shipping company's Monte Piana shipped more than 4,000 packages of Indian cotton from India. During the voyage to China, the ship unfortunately caught fire in Saigon, and a total of 300 to 400 packages of cotton were burned and waterlogged. The details are not yet known. The factory price converted from yesterday's cotton market is calculated as follows:

Local cotton business has disappeared completely into the world of foreign cotton. In fact, the source of local cotton has been cut off, and inventories are gradually becoming short, resulting in a situation of supply without a market. As for the factory, it cannot remedy the work without foreign cotton. In view of this situation, the industry has switched to purchasing Indian cotton, creating a situation where the guests are overpowering the host. The source of Su North is rare, with a total of 405 packages of Xia Sha cotton arriving. The current situation of spot cotton is listed on the left:

### Piece Goods: Guangdong and Shantou Gangs Purchase Huge Amounts Qingdao Cloths are Shipped to Shanghai for Sale - The First Time Since the War

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday's market was peaceful. White goods, fine cloth, coarse cloth, and Zhejiang road purchases were still heavy. Sales were firm and stable. However, guest gangs made scattered purchases of light-colored cloths, relying only on local streets and nearby guest gangs. Demand was weak, and distant guest gangs lacked wholesale purchases of dark-colored cloths. As a result, the selling price has fallen recently without rising. The factory's profits are decreasing day by day. Some of the cut-price goods are not even enough to cover the cost. The market is very complicated. Yesterday, Guangdong Province, Mazhang, Shantou, Leizhou, and other places added 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth, and other goods. The Zhejiang and Anhui gangs purchased more than 100 pieces of Yihua coarse cloth, Dapeng, Fugui, Three Rabbits, and other brands of fine cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, and other goods. Various ports in northern Jiangsu added more than 2,000 pieces of fine cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, printed cloth, and factory cloth. Wholesale shops on this street purchased hundreds of pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, striped plain poplin, bleached cloth, linen yarn, light-colored cloth, and printed cloth. The demand from the clothing gangs was also strong. Khaki cloth, canvas, white serge, linen glue cloth, plain poplin, and shirt poplin, etc., were sold in scattered wholesale transactions of 4,000 to 5,000 pieces.

Eastern Cloth

White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill: The morning market sales were relatively stable. The next month's futures for Longtou fine cloth opened at $13.55, and the spot price was $0.25. However, due to sluggish sales, the market was weak again. It was also heard that the Qingdao gang had 300 to 400 packages of flower and bird fine cloth packaged and sold in Shanghai, with an opening price of $13.45 per piece, and credit for one month. Therefore, the dyeing factories on this street absorbed a lot of it, and it was also learned that huge amounts of fine cloth of Longmen and other brands would continue to be shipped to Shanghai, causing the industry to be even more panicked. The shipment and sale of Qingdao piece goods to Shanghai is the first time since the war.

Export

Yesterday, 170 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Shantou, and 24 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Breaks Through the $1,300 Mark, Breaking All Previous Records Shanghai Silk's Focus is on French Sales, and High-End Factories Also Reach New High Prices

Foreign Silk Market: The market was still firm and stable yesterday. Yokohama spot prices rose by $5, breaking all previous records and rising above the $1,300 mark. Futures rose by $6. New York near-term was down by a small fraction, and far-term was up by four fractions. The market was dominated by speculation and hedging transactions, and actual sales were not very prosperous. The Lyon silk market opened at the previous day's original level for Chinese and Japanese silk prices. Inquiries to Shanghai silk were very strong, so yesterday the focus of the local silk market was still on the French merchants.

Local Silk Market: White factory XB strip silk sold very well. The French route through the Credit Suisse Bira and other banks was very smooth. The price of silk rose again by $10, but the market was quite inconsistent. Yesterday, high-end white factories with fine stripes for French sales, Dalunhe, Seven Stars, and other grades, all broke through the $2,000 mark, setting a new high price for foreign sales this year. American sales of 70-80% factory warp remained sluggish. The Jili warp of six companies was very active. Dachang and other banks entered 90 bundles of Qilin Running Horse grade yesterday, priced at $1,020, which rose again to the high price of ten days ago. Yesterday, more than 200 dan were sold for foreign sales, which can be called a valuable harvest in this bullish trend.

### The Tea Market Remains Firm

Yesterday's tea market remained firm. The tea houses continued to display sporadic new samples. Tongfu, Baochang, Jinlong, and other foreign banks continued to show interest. The total transaction volume for the city for Xin Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei, and other varieties was 290 boxes. The selling price of Xin Zhen Mei was from $250 to $262. The selling price of ordinary goods was from $192 to $215. The market conditions were unchanged from the previous day. It was heard that more than 1,000 packages of Wenzhou Mao tea had been transported by tea merchants, and local factories are now searching for them to meet the needs of foreign merchants.

### Oil Cake: Oil Market Manipulation Begins to Collapse Down $4.60 Compared to Tuesday Soybean Cake Speculation is Undecided

Soybean Oil: The market situation under the manipulation of Japanese merchants has shown signs of being unable to hide. Therefore, the bullish companies living under the wings of others have also begun to collapse, and the downward trend seems as fierce as the upward trend. Yesterday, a total of 300 barrels of Dalian barrel soybean oil were traded, and the price was reduced from $37.5 to $35.5. In addition, 100 barrels of soybean oil shipped from Kobe were sold at a price of $35.6 to $35, a sharp drop of $4.60 compared to the price opened on Tuesday. In addition to the scattered removal from this street, new hoarding households were mixed in. Peanut oil is no exception, so there were no transactions yesterday. It was found that 913 pieces of soybean oil came from Qingdao yesterday.

Soybean Cake: Short selling and buying short are very prosperous, but most of them are mutual acceptance, so although the market price has plummeted repeatedly, the transaction has not declined. The result will have to wait until June to divide profits and losses. Yesterday's market price was down by 1.1 cents compared to the previous day's market. 20,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cake to be delivered in June were traded, and the price fell from $2.85 to $2.75. In addition, 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cake were settled at a price of $2.77 to $2.27. Under the sharp reduction of the spot cake market, the dealers who generally work with the inland gangs have slightly dragged in, so the transaction has increased. It is estimated that 2,000 pieces of Yuanji cake were traded, and the price was $2.75 to $2.7475. In addition, 5,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cake were sold at a price of $2.71 to $2.70. There are also Jiangbei small soybean cakes that have risen by two or three points compared to the previously opened price, and more than 2,000 pieces were traded, and the price was $0.52. Because the taste is small and exquisite, it is easy to sell, so there is this special situation under the immediate sales.

### Grain: Hoarders Are Seeking to Sell Japonica and Indica Rice Plummeted Yesterday, Falling Sharply by $0.40 to $0.50 High-Grade Japonica Has Entered the $17 Mark

The sources of Du rice from various gangs, Hexia, and Songjiang Nangang gangs totaled eight. Although there was also news that Suzhou was closed, there were another 3,450 packages from Tongli, Kunshan, and other areas, and passenger rice continued to arrive in a steady stream. Moreover, the weather was sultry, and the quality of rice was prone to change, so people became nervous. The street was watching, and the hoarders pushed out the crowd, forming a situation of oversupply. Those holding the goods threw them sharply one after another in order to sell them. At one time, the downward trend suddenly rose, fiercely and abnormally. As a result, such as Gao Chang Japonica, only opened at $17.3, and the prices of other high-grade Japonica rice have mostly entered the $17 mark, a drop of $0.30 to $0.50 compared to the previous market. Du Yang Jianbu and passenger rice, followed by the japonica market, also showed fatigue. Fan Yuan was even more suppressed by foreign glutinous rice, and also fell by $0.40 to $0.50. It was heard that Hong Kong glutinous rice had opened at $18.

Yesterday, there was still a surge of passenger indica rice. More than 7,000 packages arrived by Yangtze River wheel and train, and the number of passenger indica rice in storage was increasing. Its removal only relied on the main street. Yesterday, shops on this street and others watched due to the hot weather, and the transaction was less than 2,000 packages. According to the Shanghai storage, the various types of indica rice amounted to as many as 300,000 packages, and Zhongjue actually accounted for the majority. Today, the weather is hot, and Zhongjue goods are prone to heat and steam wheat. The hawkers and hoarders are eager to devalue and sell them, and the market suddenly fell by $0.30 to $0.40. High-quality goods were stored and arrived in small amounts, only $0.10 to $0.20. Passenger Yuan and foreign Yuan arrived in abundance. Yesterday, because Bian Yuan was falling and lacked a way out, Saigon also fell slightly to $19 in foreign exchange. However, Saigon production prices did not loosen, and new transactions were suspended again.

### Dried Goods: Dried Longan Will Be Stored in Cold Storage - Costs Inevitably Increase -

Dried longan has been sluggish in sales recently, and there have been no transactions between companies. The mixed goods that the companies have not been able to dispose of will be piled up in cold storage to preserve their goods because the weather is gradually getting hot and the mold season is approaching. They can be compared with new goods when they are sold in early autumn. However, the rent for storage is very high, and the cost will inevitably increase.

National Medicine and Dietary Therapy

P>Notes on Febrile Disease

— Yang Yanhe

Recently, there have been quite a few patients with febrile diseases. Because patients are unaware of dietary restrictions, they often make mistakes in their diet, delaying recovery, and even relapsing after recovery. I have listed the course of the disease, dietary therapy, and contraindications below to inform patients and those who are concerned about medicine.

Course

The onset of this disease is often triggered by a cold. If it can be treated in time with cooling and detoxification, such as Yinqiao Powder, it can often be cured with one sweat. If treatment is delayed, the headache will worsen, the joints will ache, and the body will feel like a burning coal. If the exterior is not cleared, there will be chills. If the dampness is severe, there will be chest tightness or nausea and heaviness. If the tightness is too severe, it is often a precursor to the appearance of rashes and measles, so it is necessary to prevent it in advance. As for excessive sweating causing loss of yang and heat receding but the disease not receding (Western medicine calls it relapsing fever, Chinese medicine calls it lower jiao syndrome), these are even more common complications.

Dietary Therapy

When the disease has not subsided, the stomach is steaming with damp heat, so there is no need to increase food. Forcibly ingesting it will not be absorbed or digested, only increasing heat and stagnation! However, in order to maintain the body, it is necessary to slightly ingest liquid foods. It is best to stir-fry japonica rice until yellow, cook it into a porridge, and then eat the soup without eating the rice. Other things like radish soup can also be given lightly.

Contraindications

When patients have severe chills and fever, they often cry out for fruit. In Western medicine, it is thought that giving juice without渣 is beneficial. However, patients often indiscriminately give it, without separating 渣 and juice, to satisfy the patient's appetite. Not only can the heat not be reduced, but even if it is reduced, it is only temporarily, and dampness will increase, delaying the disease. As for after the disease has healed, when the stomach is hungry, there are often cases of overeating causing the disease to recur. It is important to know the warning of "eating small, frequent meals."

### White Hyacinth Bean

— Tan Shuoquan

The white hyacinth beans sold in the market are very cheap. When combined with acidic vegetables such as 雪裏蕻 to make a soup, they are no less than meat soup. When the weather is hot in the summer, eating them is most beneficial for opening the stomach and strengthening the spleen.

If we can cook this bean and rice into a thick porridge and eat it every morning, it can make the body develop healthily, and even the weak can become strong.

White hyacinth bean can replenish qi, treat weakness and chronic diarrhea, and also detoxify pufferfish and alcohol. Those who are poisoned can chew and take it raw, and it will be effective. It has been found that this bean is sweet, neutral, and non-toxic, and contains many vitamins, almost equal to soybeans. Please do not take it lightly. (Moved to Help Those in Need)

### Talking About Honey

— Jiang Jianchu

Honey is truly a wonderful product for nourishing the body. Bees hum among the flowers all day, eating their juice and absorbing their essence. They secrete honey from the honeycomb, which truly obtains the essence of plants and is suitable for all the organs of the human body.

According to honey, it is sweet, neutral, and non-toxic, and can replenish the middle, benefit qi, detoxify, moisten the lungs, clear heat, and relieve pain. It is especially effective for constipation and dry cough.

It is best to find genuine honey sold in the market. Some low-priced honey is chemical honey. The usual way to take it is to mix it with hot water, which is not very suitable. If you cook honey with fresh pears and rock sugar, take the soup to drink, it is cool and can clear heat and can treat coughs, which is very effective. Chinese medicine often uses it to harmonize hundreds of medicines in medicines and pills, and it has the same effect as licorice. Its wide range of effects can be seen.

Plasters, Pills, Powders, and Pellets

### Children Eating Sweets

— Zhou Zhilin

Children in the course of illness often dislike porridge and rice and prefer to eat sweets and other miscellaneous things. They do not know that sweets are rich in stickiness, which is detrimental to the condition. Parents often know that they should not give them, but they give them to please the children for a while. This is a big mistake. There are also children who have diseases and no desires. Parents, pitying the children for being bored, buy several kinds to relieve their loneliness. This is even more absurd. I once had a child who accidentally ate plums when he had a rash, causing the rash to be astringent and unable to penetrate smoothly, and entered a dangerous situation. Another child died after accidentally eating fried dumplings after cholera. All of these are the fault of the parents and should be taken as a deep warning. However, there are also several kinds of sweets that are not only harmless but can also treat diseases. For example, candied hawthorn is suitable for food stagnation, honey-preserved loquat is suitable for cough, winter melon candy is suitable for watery diarrhea, honey-made waxberry is suitable for dysentery, and black dates with the pits removed and stuffed with quisqualis indica meat, steamed and eaten, are suitable for intestinal worms, all of which are extremely effective.

### How to Prevent Constipation

— Xu Linyan

Young people with yin deficiency and excessive fire often suffer from constipation. Bowel movements are often once every few days, and bowel movements are extremely difficult, often with headaches and insomnia. The usual way is to use laxatives to help. In addition to drugs, there is another method to prevent constipation, but it must be persistent to be effective. I also suffered from constipation at first, but after using this method, I have had a bowel movement every morning for more than ten years. It takes a maximum of ten minutes, because I have developed a habit.

(1) Drink a large bowl of boiled water or light salt water on an empty stomach in the morning.

(2) Usually eat more vegetables, and especially eat some fruit after meals to help digestion.

(3) Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods.

(4) Quit smoking and alcohol, and take frequent showers.

(5) Develop a habit of bowel movements. (That is, have a bowel movement at a certain time. Even if you don't feel like having a bowel movement, you must go to the toilet.)

(6) Develop a certain time for bowel movements. (If it is in the early morning, it should always be in the early morning)

Small Records of Dietary Knowledge

### Aconite Treats Abdominal Pain

— Xi Minghui

People are prone to abdominal pain when they catch a cold or eat too much cold food. The simplest treatment is to cook three slices of ginger with brown sugar. If the pain is quite severe and cannot be cured immediately, aconite can be heated in hot ashes, then taken out, chopped finely, and then boiled with a bowl of water and a little cold tea until it is thoroughly boiled. Then, add brown sugar and take it cold. It will be effective.

### Good Recipe for Treating Cough

— Lian Guan

Purchase a few fresh oranges, remove the peel, and decoct with Semen Benincasae, Exocarpium Benincasae, and Ramulus Uncarius, 3 qian each. It can cure epidemic cough, and it costs very little, which is very consistent with the purpose of economy.

### What is "Do Not Speak While Eating"

— Jin Zheming

The phrase "Do Not Speak While Eating" was said by Confucius more than 2,000 years ago (see Analects, Township Party). The meaning of these three words is very obvious. We know at a glance that it means: you cannot speak while eating. But why can't you speak while eating? Is it superstition? Perhaps some people think that nuns are not allowed to speak at all when they eat, and from this they infer that Confucius's move is also superstition, but they are completely mistaken! So how should it be explained to be clear?

We all know that there are two tubes in the throat, side by side. In the front is the trachea, which Chinese medicine calls the "throat", which specializes in breathing and leads directly to the lungs. In the back is the esophagus, which Chinese medicine calls the "pharynx", which leads directly to the lungs and specializes in transporting food. Therefore, the two words "pharynx and throat" are not continuous nouns; the pharynx is the pharynx, and the throat is the throat. Although they are both inside the mouth, they are very different. In the middle of the pharynx and throat, there is another "epiglottis", which is connected to the throat. When breathing or making a sound, it will stand up in the throat. When it comes to eating, it will bend backward, covering the pharynx, so that food can directly slide into the esophagus without entering the trachea and choking. Therefore, the activity of the epiglottis is indeed extremely sensitive, and it does its utmost for people's breathing and eating. If you eat and talk at the same time, then the epiglottis will not be able to fulfill its responsibilities, and there is a risk of food entering the trachea and choking. Therefore, it is said that you cannot speak while eating.

From this point of view, what Confucius called "Do Not Speak While Eating" is really a very important principle of hygiene; and it can prove that people in our country more than 2,000 years ago were very particular about hygiene.

### Food List for Yin Deficiency Constitution

— Chen Cunren

(A) Most Suitable Nourishing Foods

(26) Ejiao Candy—For those with yin deficiency and weak lungs suffering from chronic cough, if they dislike taking medicine after treatment, they can purchase five taels of "clam powder fried Ejiao" from a pharmacy, dissolve it in water and cook it into a gelatinous liquid, then add rock sugar and continue cooking until it resembles pear paste. When consuming, either dissolve it in boiling water or swallow it directly with a spoon. The taste is extremely palatable, making it easier for children to take. This can be called Ejiao Syrup, which is excellent for nourishing yin, supplementing the lungs, and moistening coughs, making it a good remedy for dry coughs. However, this syrup is not suitable for coughs caused by colds or external factors.

(27) Dried Persimmon—Persimmons are sweet and neutral, with a slight yin-cold nature. Dried persimmons are made from white persimmons, which can be purchased from stores selling southern goods. Because they are mixed with lime on the outside, the white powder must be wiped clean. After steaming once, it becomes a yin-nourishing food. Those suffering from hemorrhoids, bloody stools, or severe constipation can eat it regularly.

(28) Red Skin Sugar Cane—This is a fruit that those with yin deficiency and internal heat can eat regularly. It has a good effect on clearing heat and promoting fluid production, making it an excellent product for treating tidal fever, thirst, dry lips, hot palms, infantile malnutrition fever, and heat after measles. It is produced in Tangxi, with purple skin and about three feet long.

(29) Torreya Seed—Children who are about to develop infantile malnutrition should eat two or three seeds every day to eliminate malnutrition.

(30) Cow's Milk—Those with yin deficiency constitution can also drink cow's milk. Those who are not used to drinking it do not need to consume it. Those with poor digestion can also avoid drinking it. Those with bad breath or belching are prone to stomach stagnation when drinking this, especially in spring and summer. Fresh milk should not be left for too long after being delivered home, and cooking should be done carefully. Regular drinking can nourish the body, but it is not entirely suitable for some Chinese physiques. Therefore, those who are not used to it can avoid drinking it.

(31) Human Milk—Human milk from healthy lactating women is more effective than cow's milk, especially when given to sick children, it is even more effective. This is a natural nutrient given by heaven to mankind, suitable for the human body, which is self-evident. Adults or elderly people should consume it immediately after it is expressed and should not leave it for a moment, as it will undergo rapid changes when exposed to air or heat, making it unpleasant to drink.

(32) Child Urine—Child urine can be consumed by those with yin deficiency and vomiting blood. It is not a groundless superstitious food. Recently, foreigners have also studied it in detail and found six ingredients: uric acid, salt, calcium, magnesium phosphate, calcium phosphate, and urea. Magnesium phosphate is a superior product for benefiting the lungs, so it is somewhat effective for those with vomiting blood. However, if the child himself is sick, such as with damp heat, blood heat, or malnutrition, the child's urine should not be used. However, there are many effective products and methods for treating vomiting blood, and child urine is not a necessary product.

(33) Honey—Replace all sugar-added foods with honey, which can nourish the lungs, nourish yin, and moisten the intestines. Because foreign sugar is hot in nature and produces phlegm, although rock sugar is better, real cane sugar rock sugar is in short supply on the market, so honey is a better flavoring.

Rehashing Old News 67 Years Ago (1940)

(From the newspaper of May, the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the deposed Qing dynasty)

### The Hangzhou Weaving Office Scripture Case

Sun Lianfu, named Shijin, with the official name Jin, was a scripture clerk in the Weaving Office and had a long-standing intimate relationship with Zheng Tian of Xiaofen Lane. After the war, Qin Shaolu, a colleague from the same office, came to live in her house. Zheng Tian saw that he was young and handsome and had an affair with him, becoming inseparable day and night; Sun Lianfu, his old flame, was cast aside and cast into the wilderness. In the year of Xuchen, Sun Lianfu and four others were found to have embezzled public funds, and they were sentenced to hard labor in Heilongjiang. Sun Lianfu, fearing the law, faked his death. His son, Han Chen, named Wenhao, a student in Renhe County, falsely reported his father's death and observed mourning. Zheng Tian, upon hearing this news, watched and waited day and night. One night, she suddenly gathered some criminals and seized Sun Lianfu on the road and took him back, extorting five hundred silver dollars. Later, Zheng Tian's second son, Duanfu, colluded with Han Chen to serve as scripture clerks in the case. In less than three years, they amassed assets of over ten thousand. Zheng Tian became increasingly extravagant and licentious, spending dozens of gold coins a day on food, clothing, and everything else, which were all extremely luxurious. She became known as the Female Weaver. In the Weaving Office, no matter how big or small the official matters were, they were settled with a word from Zheng Tian. The entire case can be copied from the Zhejiang Governor’s Office, the Education Commissioner’s Office, and the Hangzhou Prefectural Office.

This draft was mailed from Wulin to Shenjiang, in order to uphold public opinion and express deep grievances. I hope the reader will not discard it without leaving any room. I sincerely hope so!

Postscript by Xiao Jiluo.

### Looking Back

I once saw a painter in the market with a painting depicting a man riding a horse in the front, a man riding a donkey behind, and a man pushing a cart at the very end. There was an inscription that read: "Others ride horses, I ride a donkey, and behind me, there's a man pushing a cart." This is to say that people must be content. There was also an inscription on a painting of Zhang Guolao that read: "Out of the tens of millions of people in the world, who can compare to this old man? It's not about riding backwards, it's about looking back at everything." This is also a wonderful saying.

### Interview with Ms. Tang Aimei

— Le Dao

A lively discussion of the founding of the Sewing and Embroidery Training Institute. The charity sale and exhibition starts today at the Great New World department store.

Recently, several young women wanted to learn practical skills suitable for society and family needs and asked me to find a way to introduce them. By chance, I saw the "Second Anniversary Special Issue of the China Women's Sewing and Embroidery Training Institute" published in this newspaper yesterday, so I went to visit the actual site. They were very busy preparing for the opening of the charity sale exhibition. (Note: The exhibition will be held in the painting compartment of the Great New World department store for three days starting today.) There are more than a thousand items on display, such as men's and women's fashion, children's clothing, embroidered tablecloths, chair cushions, bed sheets, travel bags, etc., in a variety of styles. It is said that this is the result of more than fifty students' efforts over three months. It is planned to sell all of them for charity, which can raise two thousand yuan. After slightly recouping the costs, it will be donated to the education fund for refugee children. I am very happy with their interest in creative work and their spirit of enthusiasm for production. If women and housewives who tend to consume could learn these practical skills, then women's demands for economic independence and gender equality would not be a fantasy.

Ms. Tang Aimei, the director of the institute, led the tour. I talked to her for another ten minutes. I first asked her about the motivation for founding the school. She said: "Since graduating from the liberal arts department of the Patriotic Women's School, I have served in the education field for many years. Since 1927, I have taken over the Zhenxin Primary School. I deeply feel that Chinese children should not wear long gowns, which hinder their functional activities; they should wear short clothes and let them be active freely. At the same time, I feel that young women must learn simple skills to make a living, preferably starting from their own position, such as weaving, sewing, embroidery, and other subjects. Therefore, in addition to teaching, I focused on learning sewing and embroidery, and I have gained quite a bit of experience. For more than ten years, I have not been negligent or lazy. In 1937, I founded this school. So far, seven classes have graduated, with more than 200 students. About half of them make a living from this. Some have their own sewing machines and develop in the inland areas, and they have achieved considerable success."

Based on her experience in the past two years, she expressed several opinions: (1) Middle and lower-class women must have a skill to make a living, be able to produce on their own, and not have to rely on others. Men and women can naturally have equal rights. (2) Ordinary families in the East and West generally have sewing machines. Housewives can sew and embroider themselves, but housewives in our country's cities only know how to learn fashion and wear fashionable clothes. May I ask how many can cut, sew, and embroider themselves? (3) The number of sewing machines imported every year is alarming, and the rights and interests are flowing out. Looking at its structure, it is not complicated. Why don't our country's iron factories find a way to imitate it? (4) It is heard that Japanese high schools have sewing and embroidery subjects and pay considerable attention to them. Our country's schools have always ignored them. I think it should be a compulsory course for junior high schools and above. (5) It is absolutely unreliable for a woman to use beauty to make people love her forever. Only real skills and independent production can make people respect her. (6) I would like to expand this school after the national crisis, recruit more students, and produce more goods. Teachers and students can create a cooperative work that can be sold at any time to implement Mr. Tao Xingzhi's educational advocacy of "teaching, learning, and doing."

Finally, she reported three interesting facts: A certain lady's family was destroyed after the war. Her husband was originally a railway station manager and lost his job. She came to learn sewing, set up a machine by herself, and specialized in making various children's clothes. The business was very prosperous, and the whole family lived on this without being thrown into a refugee camp, which was regarded as the highest honor. There was a lady whom people regarded as mentally retarded. She was extremely angry and also learned sewing. She went back to her hometown - Dinghai - and opened a clothing company, actually becoming a female boss. There was also a lady who, because her husband and wife were unhappy, her husband took a concubine. She, on the other hand, lamented her bleak life experience, first being discouraged and then becoming positive, learning sewing and embroidery, and her skills were particularly excellent. She served as the director of the sewing department in a certain factory, earning a considerable monthly income. Later, her husband saw her high ambition and was dissatisfied with the concubine's consumption and enjoyment, and suddenly realized, then broke off relations with the concubine, and the husband and wife reconciled, and their happiness was not the same as before. It can be seen that a woman's profession is of great importance to her own happiness and sorrow.

Ms. Tang's words are quite interesting. I wonder what the female compatriots think after reading them?

### Officialese in Dealing with the Environment

— (Buddha)

The League of Nations meeting is an officialese way of dealing with the environment and originally did not arouse the attention and interest of the audience.

The other day, Mr. Gu Weijun, at the League of Nations meeting, appealed to member countries to embargo war materials to Japan to stop the aggression and suggested organizing an adjustment committee, but was opposed by both Britain and France. Mr. Gu's appeal seemed like "a boatman's wife asking for a hairpin with an old gold square" and it was quite appropriate that it was rejected.

And yesterday, the drafting committee of the Council of the League of Nations was drafting a resolution asking member countries to assist China and pay attention to the Japanese bombing of civilians, which is like a child crying to go to the theatre, and the father has no way but to buy a red and green newspaper for the child to read, the same trick.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 10: A Virtuous Mother with a Chignon and Blue Skirt, a Vigorous Old Man with Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves

He Liyu looked at Shuangyu at that time, and Shuangyu also remembered this matter, because only she and Wu Junru knew about this matter. They met this one-legged gentleman, who called himself an optimist, and asked them to bring a letter to Chief Zhu, only saying "Le Tian Zhao the Madman", and he would know. Later, after meeting Zhu Airen, she had forgotten about this matter and had not mentioned it. If she had mentioned this person, Airen might have known something about him. Even when she came to Freedom Village and met Chief Zhu, she had long forgotten about it. Because entrusting them to bring a letter was also an unimportant sentence. Today, listening to Zhu Aiqun suddenly say the name Zhao Letian, and also say something about "the love story of Ai," she couldn't help but be startled in her heart, and asked Zhu Aiqun: "The Zhao Letian I'm referring to, isn't it Zhao Letian who suffered an honorable injury and only has one leg?" Aiqun said: "Yes! It's this Zhao Letian, is there a second Zhao Letian?" At this time, Aiqun was also a little surprised, why would they know Zhao Letian? Weren't they newly arrived from Guangdong? Zhao Letian was often here, could it be that he recently went to Guangdong? He Liyu then continued: "We recently saw Mr. Zhao Letian. His name is Letian, and he is truly an optimist. What he said was very humorous. Although he is a disabled person, he does not take this to heart. According to his own boast, he only has one leg, but he can walk and run as fast as flying, and he can even race with people. He also knows Chief Zhu here. Since he knew that we were classmates with Sister Airen, and knew that we were going to Freedom Village, he entrusted us with a message, he said: After seeing Chief Zhu, please greet him for me. He calls himself Zhao the Madman, and he also said: After seeing the chief, just say there is a one-legged Zhao Letian Zhao the Madman, and he will know." Chief Zhu, after hearing this, said: "Ah! Where did you meet him? He does have the title of madman, people think he is a bit crazy, in fact, he is so by nature, there is no craziness in him. But he also considers himself a madman. Anyone who is truly mentally ill will never admit that they are truly mentally ill. Now that he admits that he is crazy, it can be known that he is not crazy." He Liyu then told Chief Zhu about how they met him on the train and how they started talking. She also said that he was good at telling jokes, saying that he took advantage of buying shoes, others buy a pair, he only needs to buy one. Chief Zhu laughed: "That's why people call him Zhao the Madman." (119)

### Prelude to Cigarette Card Exhibition

— Geng

Exquisite and beautiful in style and material, exhaustive in research and antiquarianism

In a rare opportunity, I saw the fine collection of cigarette cards collected by Mr. Feng Sunmei. He used scientific methods to classify and organize them, and used archeology and research to collect and explore them, spending half his life's energy. Now, he still spends one or two hours a day to study them diligently. There are several styles and several specialized terms, even foreign naturalists are carefully deliberating and investigating, which shows that this work is for raising funds to help the needy, and these fine products will be publicly exhibited in the upcoming exhibition at the end of this month, many of which are worth recording.

Western cigarette cards are not necessarily made of paper, some are made of wool, and some are made of silk, printed with patterns of national flags of various countries, as well as various artistic pictures, and also printed with famous place names of various countries. Like violets, they are so lush and verdant that you can't tell they were originally cigarette cards. The most precious of these is the "National Flag Child's Robe," which is made by sewing together various silk cigarette cards into a child's dress, which is quite interesting. This thing was once displayed in the Museum in the downtown area, and it was ingenious.

Another characteristic is that cigarette cards are also made of glass, which is slightly three-dimensional. It is said that they were exchanged for dozens of cigarette cards, so they already have the nature of souvenirs. There is one that is made up of fifty different cards to form a half-length figure, and it is not easy to have such a complete collection. Especially, there are several silk-like butterflies, with very beautiful and solemn styles. It is said that this kind of thing is very precious, and very few people collect it.

It is very common for animals and plants to be printed on cigarette cards, but there is also a lot of research involved, for example, various strange beasts, there are no Chinese names to explain, and it is even more troublesome to study its character and origin. Like The Giraffe, which is translated into Chinese as "長頸鹿" (chang jing lu - giraffe), is a ruminant artiodactyl giraffe, which is eighteen feet high from toe to top, and is the tallest of animals, but after research, it is suspected that the giraffe is the unicorn. The shape of this animal is printed with cut marks around it. If you dig down to the bottom, it is the shape of the animal, which is very interesting. Moreover, like this method, for the sake of publicity, it can be referred to and imitated.

In other ordinary cigarette cards, there are many categories, about education, there are picture literacy, cleanliness and hygiene, children's education pictures, good students, etc. Regarding self-cultivation, there are new life illustrations, and Mr. Zhu Bailu's family motto. There are also antique figures from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, such as Xi Shi and Fan Li. With classical beauty, there are also Western movie stars. There are also cigarette cards for the former President of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Zeng Shaoqing, and other interesting Henry Beetons. In the Beijing opera section, the back of the cards also has a description of the play, and these are large. In the Fu Lu Shou category, there is only one card printed with the three characters Fu Lu Shou, but Mr. Yang Caoxian's "Shou" character is written very powerfully.

More elaborate are the "Love Fruit" category, which is the dissected surface of each fruit, with a photo of a beautiful woman, called "Love Fruit", which is a two-pronged meaning of the name, and a real symbol. There is also a whole set of "Merchant Women" category, a total of three hundred and seventy cards, divided into twelve sets, looking at the various costumes of the "Merchant Women" in the past, you can also get some special feelings. In the "Hundred Ugly Pictures" category, although they are all clown-like characters, it is not easy to research the history of each person.

In the company section, each card represents a cigarette company or manufacturer, and the survey found that there are more than three hundred companies. There is also a book "　Collection Preface" (the 　character is the abbreviation for cigarette cards, the same as writing the "圖" character in the library), this book contains many prefaces, and uses various different styles and languages, French, Russian, Hui, Miao, and even Ningbo dialect Mandarin, each showing its strengths, forming a grand sight.

These cards are not only rare and precious, but also have detailed research, and the front is also inscribed by various people, just these require a lot of energy. It is very fortunate that these will be publicly exhibited in the relief exhibition, which is worth appreciating.

### Impressions of "Flying Girl"

— Ruhu

"Tail Spin" Produced by 20th Century Fox

The Grand Light Theater has been previewing "Outlaws of the Marsh" for a long time. "Asian Film News" said that it was decided to be released on the 25th, but yesterday it suddenly changed to "Flying Girl," starring Eve S. Fee, Constance Sperner, and Nan Shan Kailan. Fans who love Taylor Power may feel too surprised and regretful? According to reporters, "Outlaws of the Marsh" did not have any unexpected problems. The problem was the dispute over the price increase. Recently, the trend of price increases has been very prevalent. Relatively good movies are often increased in price, but the question is whether some movies are worth the price increase. Therefore, whether the income after the price increase can also increase in direct proportion is also a question of questions. However, what is the result of this price increase dispute for "Outlaws of the Marsh," we outsiders still do not know.

"Flying Girl," as the name suggests, is about a group of female generals competing in a national flying competition. The idea is very good, but the purpose is for huge bonuses, which led to conflicts between Torishi and Gray. This reminds me of many sports events, etc., also for the different purposes of various groups, causing many disputes, and these disputes leave a bad impression. I think that a technical competition, using a little bonus as encouragement, the original intention is unobjectionable, but often various opposite results occur, which cannot be denied its responsibility. Therefore, it is better to use honor prizes than to use bonuses as encouragement. For the giver, it fulfills the original intention of encouragement, and for the receiver, it also gets spiritual comfort. Especially for aviation flying, bonuses should not be the ultimate goal.

The best scene handled by the director is after Speed crashes and dies. He had tried his best to describe Speed and Louise's love in the front, and after his death, Louise was grief-stricken and tried to take off in a plane to commit suicide. The emotional control was very strong. For example, Louise's sleepless night; taking off in a plane by taking advantage of the gap; Torishi also taking off in a plane to catch up; and after several close-ups of Louise's plane descending straight down, it connects to Torishi coming out of the plane, which is very touching in its subtle writing.

It was because of this incident that Gray and Torishi abandoned their past hatred and fulfilled Torishi's long-cherished wish. This kind of sincere friendship is worth cherishing.

This rising star, Nan Shan Kailan, played Louise very well. At first, her love with Speed was lively and lovely; later, when she took off in a plane, she was desperately sad. At the same time, the "movie emperor" Cherful Ray of the "Seventh Heaven" era only has a few short shots here, and I can't help but sigh again...

### Mei Wanhua's Memoirs of Rescuing Liu

— Li Feishu

Reading Mr. Xu Muyun's "Anecdotes from the Pear Garden," which recounts the story of Chu Yupu killing Liu Hanchen and Gao Sankui, stirred memories in my mind. The arrest of Liu and the others actually took place at the First Stage Theater in Beiping, not in Tianjin. In Mr. Xu's article, there's a passage that says, "He telegraphed Mei Dawang, asking him to plead with Lu Zhang for their release. Who knew that Old Chu, without waiting for Zhang's telegram to arrive, had already added a charge of communism and had the two of them shot." In reality, Old Chu had already received Zhang's telegram and had even agreed to spare their lives. Who knew that he was two-faced and, in a fit of rage, disregarded his promise and had the two executed, so Zhang berated him over the phone for being petty, dishonorable, and untrustworthy. Regarding Mr. Mei's efforts to rescue them, as I was by his side daily, I knew the details quite well. I'll now recount some of it to supplement Xu's account.

Hanchen and the others went to perform in Beiping to assist Zhao Junyu, not as a solo act. They first performed in Tianjin, where ticket sales were quite good. Hanchen was young, handsome, and dashing, and one of Chu's concubines fell for him at first sight! She repeatedly sent Ma Mou to summon him. Liu initially maintained his integrity, but it's said that Gao Sankui encouraged him from the side, and he eventually went to a restaurant for a private meeting. However, they didn't get as far as a romantic encounter. Hanchen, fearing Old Chu's power, tried to avoid her, but Chu's concubine was overly persistent in her pursuit! Whenever Hanchen appeared on stage, Chu's concubine would always appear in a box seat; when Hanchen finished performing, Chu's concubine would also leave. In the concubine's mind, this showed her deep affection, but she didn't realize that in such a crowded and public place, she was only hastening Liu's misfortune. Hanchen, aware of his precarious situation, pretended to go to Beiping to perform in order to avoid her. Upon arriving in Beiping, he and Junyu first visited Mr. Mei at Wuliang Daren Hutong. I was present at the time and noticed his darting eyes, constantly shifting. After he left, I said to Mr. Mei, "Liu's expression seems troubled, as if he has deep worries?" Mr. Mei said, "I have the same feeling. His eyes reveal a fierce omen, indicating he may not live long!" We made these remarks, unaware of the secret affair. Before he had even performed for a few days at the First Stage Theater, news came that he and Gao Sankui had been arrested. As Mr. Xu recorded, the performance hadn't even ended. They were taken directly to Tianjin and imprisoned at the governor's office. Upon hearing the news, Mr. Mei, out of a sense of camaraderie, immediately sought rescue measures. He figured the only way was to go through Zhang Xiaokun, hoping a word from him could save their lives. So, he personally went to plead with him.

At that time, Zhang was powerful and influential in Yandu (Beiping), arrogant and conceited! Surrounded by concubines and harboring scoundrels, he indulged in singing, dancing, gambling, and revelry day and night. Those eager for favor flocked to his door. Mr. Mei, aside from performing, didn't often visit his home. Occasionally, he would attend banquets, remaining silent, dignified, and never frivolous. He maintained a detached attitude, being tactful but not abrasive. Looking back at his situation then, one truly feels how difficult it is to navigate social circles. Upon hearing his plea to rescue Liu and Gao, Zhang immediately instructed his secretary to draft a telegram to Tianjin, using forceful language, and said to Mei, "Old Chu is too petty. If my concubines have affairs, I allow it. A man with multiple wives can only sleep with one at a time! The rest are left neglected. Why not find a cook to replace them? It's better to have no resentful women in the bedroom! Just be discreet and don't let me see it. Seeing the one I love embraced by another would ignite a fire of jealousy, and my pistol wouldn't be forgiving. If any of you are infatuated with my concubines, you're welcome to chase them away." Mr. Mei was stunned into silence. As he was leaving, Zhang said, "My telegram will surely spare their lives. You must repay me with a painted fan." Mei agreed, expressing his gratitude and departing.

Upon returning, he immediately searched through his boxes for an old Qianlong imperial Xiangfei bamboo fan. He instructed me to paint on the original vermilion surface, as Mr. Mei didn't want to rush the artwork. Under the lamplight, I painted several stalks of deep green double-outlined bamboo. Mr. Mei slightly modified it and added a pile of rocks. Although hastily done, the painting was still elegant and pleasing. The next day, he sent a messenger to present it to Zhang. In the afternoon, Zhang received a reply telegram from Tianjin and had it copied and sent along. I don't remember the exact wording now, but the gist was that Chu had read Zhang's telegram and that Liu and Gao were in no danger of losing their lives. He intended to give them a mild reprimand and release them soon. Mr. Mei immediately conveyed this message to the families of Liu and the others. Who knew that three days later, news came from Tianjin that Liu and Gao had been executed under the charge of communism! It's said that Old Chu dismissed his attendants in the afternoon and personally interrogated them. The confessions were never leaked. After the interrogation, at the break of dawn, they were immediately executed in the governor's office. Their bodies were thrown out through holes in the wall, not through the main gate, as was the old custom of the yamen. Chu's concubine and Ma Mou were also said to have died by Old Chu's pistol. Some say that the exposure of the affair was due to Ma Mou demanding a reward from Liu, who, feeling innocent, refused. Gao Sankui also humiliated him from the side. In a fit of anger, Ma Mou exaggerated the truth and leaked the secret to Chu, leading to this tragic and unjust case.

During the arrest, Junyu's name was also on the list. It happened that a certain yamen runner, a former acquaintance of Zhao, had already planned a way out. So, when he led the arresting officers to the backstage, he loudly asked, "Who is Zhao Junyu? Who is Zhao Junyu?" He feigned ignorance to alert him to escape. Junyu, innocent himself, initially didn't realize their intention. He stepped forward and declared, "I am Zhao Junyu." At this critical moment, the astute yamen runner slapped Zhao on the cheek, saying, "Who are you? How dare you impersonate Zhao Junyu and deceive my blind eyes!" At this point, Junyu finally understood! He retreated into the crowd and seized the opportunity to slip away, thus avoiding the disaster. In contrast, his friend had already become a wronged soul in the afterlife. Alas! Warlords kill people like grass, and Old Chu was not the only one. Karma is cyclical; those who kill will also be killed. How long ago was it? What became of Chu and Zhang? As I write this, I can't help but feel a sense of sorrow!

### Chaozhou Opera Performed at the Queen Theater: A Visit to the Lao Zheng Shun Xiang Troupe

— Haisheng

The Chaozhou Opera Lao Zheng Shun Xiang Troupe arrived in Shanghai on the Dasheng ship at nine o'clock the night before. Yesterday, the reporter went to the Queen Theater to visit. As I entered the office, I passed the stage and saw a group of very lively child actors gathered there, sitting. They wore uniform gray uniforms, indicating a well-disciplined troupe.

This group of Chaozhou opera performers was invited by the Hehe Company, organized by Cai Sicong, Cai Jianchu, Hong Qingmu, and others. According to Cai Jianchu, these child actors originally performed in the four rural townships of Shantou. Because the Japanese air raids were extremely fierce, the people of Shantou would go to the opposite bank of the river early in the morning and only return after six o'clock in the evening. Therefore, their coming to Shanghai was partly to seek refuge. There are more than eighty child actors, led by Chen Hejin and Zong Fengyi. The oldest is seventeen or eighteen years old, and the youngest is only thirteen or fourteen years old.

As for the plays performed, there are historical ones and trendy ones, totaling more than thirty. Currently, they are temporarily performing old plays, and after they settle down a bit, they will rehearse new plays that cater to the trend. They have a three-month contract with the Queen Theater. In terms of roles, there is no distinction between first, second, or third leads; the entire troupe is treated as a unit.

If circumstances permit, they will start performing as scheduled tonight, because most of the luggage still has to be inspected by customs. The program has been assigned as Shi Liangyu. Finally, Mr. Cai also told me that this is the second time that Chaozhou opera has come to Shanghai. The first time was five or six years ago, when they performed at the Great China Theater. He doesn't have any certainty about how well they will do this time.

Today's "Chess Garden" is suspended for one day, and it will be published as usual tomorrow. (Editorial Department)

### Silhouettes of Shanghai Stars in Hong Kong (4)

— Silhouette by: Zheng Zhihang Written by: Zheng Youxuan

Li Keng

This little angel of the screen has been studying in Hong Kong since he went to Hong Kong with his parents. Li Minwei also hired a famous musician to teach him piano, and I heard he is doing quite well. But his acting career seems to be following the same path as Lin Chuchu. Apart from appearing in "Rouge Tears" and "Tears of War," screen audiences rarely see his shadow. Recently, he will star in a children's film called "Little Overlord," which will be produced by Li Minwei.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Spending Public Funds to Train Ten Talented Students

There is also a bizarre thing that is quite laughable when you talk about it. It is said that in the past, the teacher in the opera school deliberately called his disciples to surround themselves on damp brick ground or land without floors, and asked people with scabies to lie on the same reed mat with him, or the two would cover the same bed sheet, so that in a few days, his talented disciples would also be infected. After suffering from scabies, the itching was unbearable, and they would toss and turn at night, always scratching non-stop. Since he was awake there, he had to recite the opera words taught by the teacher during the day, and at the same time, he had to ponder some tunes in his heart. If not, young children, full of vigor, would fall headfirst on the bed as soon as it got dark, and immediately fall asleep like dead people, and when they woke up the next day, they would forget everything. Teachers and disciples were mostly illiterate, relying entirely on oral instruction and finger transmission, and if they forgot, they had to be taught again from the beginning, which would be a bit troublesome. If you use the unscientific stupid method mentioned above, which makes the disciples scratch their scabies and recite opera words, it is actually much easier to put in effort while sleeping, and at the same time, the disciples' studies can progress faster. However, this kind of unhygienic, inhumane, and unscientific education method is really rare and strange, it is hard to believe how they could think of it! This kind of cruel education that abuses students certainly makes general young children regard it as a dangerous path, being beaten, suffering, and even not being able to sleep peacefully, so suicide and escape are often unavoidable. In the past, the regulations of the opera school must have written these words on it, which was a kind of expression of pre-emptive disavowal of responsibility to the students' parents. As for the China Opera School, it is a product of the new era. Although it is sometimes stricter and tighter in management than ordinary schools, it will never have anything like the above-mentioned events. Now, the school has actually copied all these sentences in the guarantee, which is a bit too cautious. Originally, any kind of transitional education is indeed very difficult. Too new is not very applicable, and too old is not in line with the trend. In recent years, I don't know how many people have advocated improving opera, but how to start improving it must be a joint discussion by experts in opera research from all over the country, openly and impartially expressing their opinions. It is impossible to obtain satisfactory results. If you rely on the private opinions of a few people to improve Chinese opera, that is a joke and a strange talk. (21)
