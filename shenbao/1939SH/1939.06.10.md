### A Large Number of Japanese Planes Again Attacked Chongqing Yesterday, Two Were Shot Down by the Chinese Side; Bombs Rained Down, and Fires Broke Out in the City; Nanning and Enshi Were Also Bombed; Two More Groups Harassed the Xiang Border

(Chongqing) On the afternoon of the 9th, two waves of Japanese planes took off from Hankou and flew west to invade. The first wave consisted of nine planes, which dropped bombs in Enshi, Hubei Province. The second wave consisted of more than 20 planes, which went straight to attack Chongqing. The Chinese air defense authorities issued air raid and emergency alerts. The Japanese planes then split into two groups, one of nine and one of twelve, which successively sneaked into the city's airspace. The Chinese air force and anti-aircraft units launched a fierce attack on them, and two Japanese planes were shot down by the Chinese. The search for the wreckage is currently underway. When the Japanese planes sneaked into the city's airspace, they dropped bombs indiscriminately in several places and then fled. Because the Chinese air defense and rescue efforts were well-organized, although fires broke out in several places, they were quickly extinguished, and there were very few casualties. (9th Telegram)

(Chongqing) Chongqing was again subjected to an air raid by Japanese planes tonight. A total of 27 Japanese bombers, divided into two teams, attacked, raining bombs on the same areas that suffered a terrible bombing on May 25. A major fire broke out in the city. Chinese anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely at the Japanese planes, and several Chinese fighter planes also took to the air to intercept them. The results of the air battle are not yet known, but the anti-aircraft gun units said that they had shot down two Japanese planes. At 6 p.m., Japanese planes were seen flying over Yichang and heading upstream. An alert was immediately issued in Chongqing. At 7 p.m., the first team of Japanese planes, consisting of nine bombers, appeared over Chongqing. More than half an hour later, the second team, consisting of 18 planes, arrived in succession. Before reaching Chongqing, the nine Japanese planes had bombed Enshi on the border of Sichuan and Hubei. (9th Reuters Telegram)

(Yichang) Forty-seven Japanese planes flew in several batches over Yichang around 1 p.m. on the 9th, and fled westward. Among them, nine again invaded Enshi and bombed it. (9th Telegram)

Hengyang: According to air defense reports, on the morning of the 9th, eleven Japanese planes flew in two batches along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to harass the Xiang border. One batch of eight planes, with three planes circling in the Liling area and five planes sneaking into Hengyang at 9:50 a.m. to drop bombs. Another batch of three planes also sneaked in from Jiangxi and joined the Japanese planes in Liling to observe the Zhuzhou area. (9th Telegram)

Guilin: Sixteen Japanese planes took off from Beihai at 9 a.m. on the 9th and sneaked into Nanning's airspace at 10 a.m., dropping more than 30 bombs, mostly in the wilderness, injuring only three people and destroying six or seven houses. (9th Telegram)

Fuzhou: A Japanese warship-based plane took off six times today to bomb Changmen, dropping 14 bombs. (9th Telegram)

(Chongqing) At 7:10 p.m. this evening, Chongqing was attacked by two waves of Japanese planes, lasting a total of fifteen minutes. During this period, first nine Japanese planes sneaked into Chongqing's airspace, followed by eighteen Japanese planes, dropping more than 30 bombs on Chongqing's urban area. The Japanese planes were flying at an altitude of 7,000 feet, and there were low clouds overhead in Chongqing at the time. At the same time, Chinese fighter planes also took off to meet the enemy, so the first batch of eight Japanese planes were intercepted by Chinese planes and could not move freely. However, at this time, the second batch of 18 Japanese planes invaded again. For a time, searchlights and anti-aircraft guns were active, but they were obscured by clouds and could not fully exert their power. Before long, the first batch of Japanese planes, under constant pursuit by Chinese planes outside the clouds, fled first. According to official sources, two Japanese planes have been shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft guns. It is reported that when the Japanese planes attacked, they first dropped flares to illuminate the ground like daylight before dropping bombs. The bombs dropped, as far as Chongqing is concerned, were mostly very heavy, with two weighing 500 pounds, which exploded into large craters 40 feet wide and 10 feet deep after landing. For a time, rubble flew everywhere, and even distant places were affected. One of the bombs hit a reservoir, and the water in the reservoir was splashed up to a height of eight feet. The building opposite the YMCA, owned by the Canadian Church, was heavily damaged. There were also many bombs dropped near the Sullivan Hotel, the only modern building in Chongqing. After the Japanese planes dropped their bombs, a major fire broke out in the lower city of Chongqing, but the fire brigade immediately dispatched to put out the fire, so the fire did not spread. A fire also broke out near the YMCA, but it was extinguished after the fire brigade rushed to the rescue. As for the ambulance team's actions, they were the most agile. The first to dispatch were the Girls' Ambulance Team and the Catholic Ambulance Team, led by Father Zhao, who wore long black robes, which contrasted sharply with the Red Cross Ambulance Team, who wore white clothes. By 8 p.m., the alert was completely lifted. At this time, the streets were full of pedestrians, and the shops were all open for business, as if there had been no air raid. An Associated Press reporter inspected all sides after the incident and saw that there were only three injured. It is not known how many were trapped in the rubble. In short, the number of casualties in this raid will certainly not exceed 200 people. Furthermore, many of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes this time failed to explode. After these unexploded bombs were discovered, Chinese soldiers immediately built a fence around them to prevent civilians from approaching them. According to people familiar with the matter, the reason why there were so few casualties this time was due to the effectiveness of the anti-aircraft guns. When the anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, the Japanese planes had no time to carefully identify their targets, so the bombs they dropped were mostly indiscriminate. (9th Associated Press Telegram)

### Three Routes Invade Pinglu, Japanese Casualties Reach 2,000; The Chinese Army's Goal of Attrition Has Been Achieved; Transfer to the Suburbs to Fight in the Outskirts

Yuanqu: A total of 7,000 to 8,000 Japanese troops in southern Shanxi launched a large-scale invasion from Zhangdian, Yuncheng, and Jiexian in three routes, and the situation immediately became tense. One force of 3,000 to 4,000 in Zhangdian attempted to directly attack Maojin and attack Pinglu from the flanks. After the Chinese army bravely counterattacked and attacked from both sides, they have successively recovered the strongholds of Shengrenjian, Hanyao Village, and Dongdachen, and are now blocking the Japanese army in the areas of Xidachen Village and Shuntou Village, and are engaged in a standoff. One force of about 3,000 in Yuncheng, after capturing the two strongholds of Huadong Pingtou and Xindian (northwest of Pinglu), attempted to attack Pinglu. More than 3,000 Japanese troops in Jiexian, after capturing Huache Village (southwest of Pinglu), also attacked Pinglu from the flanks. A certain Chinese army unit blocked and attacked them separately, and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army for two days, killing more than 1,000 Japanese troops, and also dispatched many daredevils to engage in bayonet melee, repeatedly charging and killing. As the Japanese reinforcements increased, the Chinese side, due to strategic considerations and the goal of attrition having been achieved, transferred to the suburbs of Pinglu at noon on the 8th and continued to attack the Japanese army in the outskirts. After the Japanese army captured Pinglu, they set fire to the villages inside and outside the city, which continued all day. A unit stationed in the city is moving towards the northeast, and a unit has sneaked into Majiazhuang on the opposite bank of Lingbao, attempting to attack Wanzhaocun (northeast of Majiazhuang). In summary, the Japanese army launched a three-pronged invasion of Pinglu this time. After the Chinese army intercepted and attacked them separately, the casualties were nearly 2,000 and countless ammunition was consumed. Although Pinglu was captured, the gains did not outweigh the losses. Generally speaking, it is judged that the Japanese's attempt this time is to try to sweep away the Chinese side's strength in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Judging from their weakened state, they have no ability to cross the river. (9th Telegram)

(Hong Kong) Shaanxi Telegram: The Japanese troops who invaded Liulin Qikou in southwestern Shanxi are now in a difficult situation.

After a fierce battle until 4 a.m., Fuhe was recaptured by the Chinese army. All the Japanese troops retreated to Zhongxin Zhucun. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese troops were killed or wounded, four Japanese soldiers were captured, and a large number of firearms, construction materials, military supplies, and documents were seized. (9th Telegram)

Dali: The Japanese troops in Fushan have been under fierce attack by the Chinese army for days, and have suffered heavy casualties.

The Chinese army is currently advancing towards the suburbs. (9th Telegram)

Yingde: Several hundred Japanese troops in Longkou sneaked into the vicinity of Lianglong Market at noon on the 6th and were severely attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army then sent reinforcements to launch a fierce attack. The Chinese army attacked the flanks of the Japanese army on one side, and the two sides attacked each other, killing Japanese troops everywhere. As of the evening of the 7th, they were still fighting in the area. (9th Telegram)

Editorial

### The Crisis of the Japanese Army's Manipulation of the Shanghai Customs

The Extra Deputy Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs issued a notice a few days ago stating that, starting from June 1st, in the nine Jianghai ports, merchant ships would be prevented from clearing customs and sailing without the permission of the Japanese army and navy. It is reported that customs officials have already begun to implement this order. In recent days, many foreign merchant ships sailing to these nine ports have changed their sailing locations. The British Taikoo Company's Wantong ship, because its sailing destination was Haimen Qishu, one of the nine ports listed, was refused customs clearance when it applied. Previously, the Japanese navy's inspection of British and French mail ships was regarded by various governments as an intentional blockade of the Chinese coast, and they protested to Japan. Japan claimed that it did not prohibit non-Chinese ships from sailing along the Chinese coast. Now, the facts show that Japan has disguisedly prevented foreign merchant ships from sailing in inland rivers and coastal ports. What is this if not a tightening of the blockade?

Japan's use of the customs to prevent foreign merchant ships from sailing in inland rivers and coastal ports is not only aimed at blockading foreign merchant ships and destroying existing European and American shipping and commerce in China. At the same time, it is also an attempt to seize the administrative power of the customs. The Jianghai Customs is one of the Chinese customs that has fallen into enemy hands, and it is also the Chinese customs with the largest revenue, and it has a very close relationship with European and American countries. Japan, fearing serious international disputes, does not handle it like other customs. After the Chinese army retreated west, it reached a so-called Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement with the United Kingdom in May last year through peaceful negotiations. Since then, the Jianghai Customs has also become a deformed agency. On the surface, the countries concerned still claim that they will maintain the integrity of China's customs administrative sovereignty. However, in reality, the customs cannot fully implement the orders of the Chinese government. The original intention of the British side was to maintain its realistic interests through a policy of compromise. Now, not only are her realistic interests annihilated because Japan refuses to pay foreign debts, but Japan is also using the customs to destroy all her rights in China. This was not what she had expected at the beginning!

Now Japan seems not satisfied with the current situation of the Jianghai Customs, and it is attempting to gain full control. The order of the Deputy Commissioner is regarded as the beginning of this attempt. The so-called Deputy Commissioner was originally established by the customs authorities to cope with special circumstances. His duties should be to serve the customs, not to execute the orders of the Japanese army and navy authorities. Furthermore, does this Customs Commissioner in the Jianghai Customs have the right to issue notices and order customs officials to execute them without the approval of the original highest authority of the Jianghai Customs and the Inspector General? This is a fundamental question. If the Deputy Commissioner is not the highest administrative authority of the Jianghai Customs, then he does not have the power to issue such a notice. Issuing a notice without this authority is a destruction of the administrative power of the Jianghai Customs.

The action of this Deputy Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs has a considerable relationship with the current Far East situation, especially the British's compromise in the face of events, which gives Japan a great encouragement. In addition, customs officials not fulfilling their due obligations also have some responsibility. Why did the highest customs authority not try to prevent the notice issued by the Deputy Commissioner in advance? After receiving the notice, why did the customs officials not ask about the normal procedures and execute it immediately? After discovering this notice, why did the highest customs authority not order its cancellation? This is also a factor that prompted Japan's bold action. Establishing the so-called "New Order in East Asia" is Japan's guise, and it is being continuously promoted. Regarding the Jianghai Customs issue, if this action of blockading traffic in nine ports does not provoke an effective resistance from the countries concerned, similar incidents will certainly occur one after another in the future. Now it can use the customs to blockade the nine ports, and in the future it can extend to blockade other ports. With great power in hand, nothing is impossible. As long as it is absolutely beneficial to Japan, what does it care about the trade of European and American countries with China and even other interests? Therefore, the action of this Deputy Commissioner is just a preliminary probe to attempt to seize the entire administrative sovereignty of the Jianghai Customs. The relevant government officials and businessmen in China are currently discussing countermeasures. We not only hope to take effective protests and promptly repeal this prohibition, but also hope to do our best to prevent similar illegal actions from continuing to occur!

### Japanese Newspapers Arbitrarily Attack the Chinese Concessions in Shanghai "Eliminating British Power in the Far East Does Not Need to Take into Account the Rights of Third Countries"

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today wrote articles arbitrarily attacking foreign concessions in China, and demanded the elimination of British power in the Far East. "Kokumin Shimbun" claimed that "Japan has decided to carry out the war of liberating Asian nations, and therefore it is necessary to solve all problems of foreign concessions once and for all." The newspaper insisted that Japan must eliminate British power in the Far East, remove "pro-British politicians" from the Japanese government, and strengthen Japan's relationship with various "friendly countries." "Asahi Shimbun" claimed that Japan has decided to adopt a tough policy towards China, and should also adopt the same policy towards third countries that take an anti-Japanese attitude. "If necessary, Japan will revoke its recognition of the British and French concessions in Tianjin." Manchukuo Counselor Ohashi published an article in various newspapers, which especially attracted the attention of political figures. The article claimed that Japan has decided not to negotiate with General Chiang Kai-shek, and this same attitude should be applied to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. If Japan does not eliminate the power of third countries in China, its war against China will never be completely successful. Ohashi advocated that Japan should carry out its plan to transform Asia with the greatest determination, without regard to the rights of third countries, so that the war against China can be ended at an early date.

### Pseudo-Officials Withdraw from Tianjin Concessions

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The head of the Tianjin pseudo-police bureau recently ordered that all personnel of the "Provisional Government" and the "Tianjin Municipal Government" residing in the British and French concessions must withdraw from the two concessions before June 9. This morning, more than 100 households have moved out of the concessions. It is reported that the Japanese authorities have decided to take free action. In order to show their tough attitude, the Japanese postal ship companies have withdrawn their goods from the British and French concessions and notified all customers to pick up their goods quickly. (9th Telegram)

(Tianjin) The Chinese Association of the British organ will hold a general meeting tomorrow night to discuss the situation in Tianjin. Reuters learned from reliable sources that if the four Chinese demanded by the Japanese side are not extradited, the Japanese side will take retaliatory measures to completely isolate the British concession, and will block the entrances and exits of the British concession and restrict the movement of British people, British ships, and goods, except for food. If the Japanese side takes this action, all residents of the British concession, including tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign people who are not British citizens, will suffer severe hardship, and the French concession may also be similarly affected. (9th Reuters Telegram)

(London) Ambassador Guo visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax this morning for a long talk and informed him of the contents of the telegram received from the Chinese government today. The telegram instructed him to raise a protest again regarding the extradition of the four suspects who assassinated Cheng Xihou, the superintendent of the Tianjin Customs. Although these four suspects have not yet been extradited to the Japanese side, the Chinese government does not seem to be completely satisfied with this matter. There are two reasons for the Chinese protest: 1. This move will be tantamount to recognizing the government under the wing of the Japanese in Peiping. 2. It will set a dangerous precedent. Guo's visit this morning was partly of a social nature, introducing Wang Zhengting to the British Foreign Secretary. The attitude held by the British authorities is that no Chinese can be surrendered to the Chinese authorities from foreign concessions or settlements unless there is definite evidence of a criminal offense. (9th Reuters Telegram)

(Tianjin) The Japanese side issued an ultimatum to the British concession authorities yesterday morning, demanding the extradition of the four suspects who assassinated Cheng Xigeng, the superintendent of the Customs, within two days, otherwise they will completely cut off traffic between the British concession and the outside world. The Tianjin Municipal Government under the wing of the Japanese ordered its Chinese and foreign officials and employees residing in foreign concessions last night to withdraw within 48 hours.

(Xiamen) It is heard that the Gulangyu Public Concession Municipal Council has accepted the first and fifth of the five demands made by the Japanese side.

### British Military Officers Detained in Zhangjiakou; Japanese Say They Will Release Them Early; Cooper Is Willing to Suffer with Spear; Japanese Plan to Send Spear to the Chinese Interior

(Peiping) According to the Japanese spokesman here, the Japanese side has decided to release Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the military attache of the British Embassy in China, and his interpreter Cooper early. At the same time, according to the British Embassy, ​​the Japanese claim that the two men used the radio stations of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces to report the activities of the Japanese army to the British authorities in Shanghai and Peiping lacks factual evidence. Japanese news agencies also claimed that the two had provided intelligence to the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. Although this claim cannot be verified, it is at least the view of the Japanese side. According to the Japanese spokesman, the interpreter Cooper could have been released, but because Cooper wanted to suffer with Spear, he was kept. As for Spear, the Japanese side intends to send him back to the Chinese interior. According to Langm, a Chinese counselor at the British Embassy, when he sought to meet with senior Japanese officials in Zhangjiakou, they refused to meet him and did not allow him to see the detained person.

### British House of Lords Discusses the Reality of Aid to China, Halifax Says He Is Blameless and Will Do His Best to Protect the Interests of British Nationals

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax made a speech in the House of Lords today during a debate on foreign affairs, expressing the government's great concern and anxiety about the situation in the Far East. He said, "When a number of unfortunate incidents occurred, we did our best to ensure that the interests of British nationals were given due respect and that the provisions of treaties were respected as far as was within our power, as the actions of the Japanese side have involved the provisions of treaties in more than one respect. We will work with other powers to do everything in our power to carry out this policy." Halifax continued, "Lord Snell recently mentioned the Far East issue, the overall situation in that area, as he said before, in many ways, and because of more than one unfortunate incident, has caused great concern and anxiety to the government." Halifax said, "I can only assure Lord Snell that when a number of unfortunate incidents occurred, we did our best to ensure that British nationals received due respect. By this, I mean the interests of British nationals and their material interests. Lord Snell also mentioned the recent resolution passed in Geneva regarding aid to China and said that he had a particularly dissatisfied assessment of the sympathetic nature of the Foreign Secretary's speech to China when the Council of the League of Nations discussed this matter. It should be noted that Dr. Gu Weijun has a different opinion on this. The Doctor thanked me for expressing sympathy to China during my speech, so I replied that my conscience was not particularly tormented by Lord Snell's accusation and should be forgiven." Lord Snell spoke first today, opening the debate. Lord Snell said that the overall situation in the Far East now seems very unsatisfactory. British ships are being stopped and searched, officials are being arrested and imprisoned, and soldiers are apparently being bayonetted to death. He does not want to criticize the Foreign Secretary in any way, but his reply to the appeal seems to be disturbingly unsympathetic. (Reuters, 8th)

(London) During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, several members of parliament from various parties raised questions about the Far East issue, which were answered one by one by Butler, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Labor MP Ponsonby asked, "Foreign Secretary Halifax recently gave a speech at the League of Nations Council in Geneva, expressing his sympathy for China. Does the government intend to continue to implement the resolutions passed by the League of Nations and do its best to help China?" Under-Secretary of State Butler immediately replied, "Yes." Conservative MP Morgan asked, "Foreign Secretary Halifax stated at the League of Nations Council that no further assistance could be given to China. What has been the government's implementation of the resolutions passed by the League of Nations? I would like Prime Minister Chamberlain to provide a clear explanation." Under-Secretary Butler immediately provided a written reply, saying, "Mr. Morgan seems to have misunderstood. Foreign Secretary Halifax stated at the League of Nations Council that the resolutions of the League of Nations were a common policy agreed upon by all member states. The British government has never sought to deviate from it. On the contrary, it has taken action in all aspects in accordance with the obligations arising from this resolution to assist China. I intend to send Mr. Morgan a summary of the Council's agenda for him to read, so that he will know that my words are not false." A certain member then raised the case of Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the British military attaché in China, being detained by the Japanese authorities. Under-Secretary Butler replied that the British authorities are taking all necessary steps to urgently negotiate with the Japanese authorities to urge his early release. Conservative MP Major-General Knowles asked whether the British, French, and American ambassadors and naval commanders in China had recently met in Shanghai to discuss the issue of restoring freedom of navigation for ships of various countries in the Yangtze River, and what the results were and what measures would be taken. Under-Secretary Butler immediately provided a written reply, saying, "The British, French, and American ambassadors and naval commanders recently happened to be in Shanghai at the same time and must have taken the opportunity to exchange views on various common issues, but Foreign Secretary Halifax is unaware of any formal meeting of the ambassadors. Regarding British commercial issues on the Yangtze River, Sir Craigie, the ambassador to Japan, continued to negotiate on the 6th of this month." (Havas, 8th)

### Yunnan-Burma Railway Construction Plan Is Under Meticulous Consideration by the British

(London) Moorehead, Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma, replied in writing in the House of Commons today to a question from Conservative Wilson, saying that the proposal for the Yunnan-Burma Railway has been submitted to the Marquis of Zetland, Secretary of State for India and Burma, for consideration, but there is no sufficiently concrete plan for a feasible decision on this proposal. All proposals regarding the connection of the Yunnan-Burma Railway must, of course, be subject to extremely detailed consideration by military advisors to the British government and the governments of India and Burma. (Reuters, 9th)

### A Small Island in the North Sea is Fortified by Germany, Strategically Important, and Foreigners are Prohibited from Visiting

(Berlin) The North German Lloyd shipping company recently issued a notice stating that, having received orders from the government, the island of Helgoland in the German North Sea is prohibited from foreign visitors from today, and therefore the company's ships will no longer sail to the island. Helgoland is a small rocky island with an area of 0.63 square kilometers, located at the confluence of the Elbe and Weser rivers, and is one of Germany's important naval strategic locations. The island originally belonged to Britain, and Germany obtained it from Britain in 1890 in exchange for some territory in East Friesland. Germany then made every effort to develop the island, building fortifications and torpedo boat ports, and it occupied an extremely important position during the European War. The island's fortifications were subsequently restricted by the Treaty of Versailles. In recent years, Germany has again fortified the island. Hitler visited the island in early April of this year. The island's fortification project is currently under major construction, so, with the exception of German tourists who can still visit the island on holidays, people of all countries are generally prohibited. (Haitong, 9th)

### France Expands Navy, Adds Fourteen Warships

(Paris) Naval Minister Campinchi recently issued a ministerial order instructing naval shipyards to begin construction, each with a displacement of 600 tons. (Havas, 9th)

### Soviet Union Appoints Two New Deputy Foreign Ministers

(Moscow) The People's Committee recently appointed Dekanozov, former Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee, and Kozyrevsky, former Director of the Far East Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, as Deputy People's Commissars for Foreign Affairs.

### Japan-Germany-Italy Alliance Negotiations Have Not Yet Achieved Concrete Results

(Berlin) Regarding the issue of strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact, as far as political figures here know, Japan's recent proposal is mainly based on Germany and Italy's policy of assisting Japan in the Far East. The current negotiations have not yet achieved concrete results. Although the Japanese here have long expressed optimism, in reality, the so-called strengthening plan is still abstract in nature. (Havas, 2nd)

### British Foreign Secretary Announces That the Era of Aggression is Over, Any Further Occurrence Will Meet with Significant Resistance, British-Soviet Negotiations Still Have Some Difficulties, and If Germany Repents, They Are Still Willing to Negotiate

(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax declared today during a foreign affairs debate in the House of Lords that the British government's desire is to devote the entire strength of the Empire to peace and forcefully stated that the era in which the independence of European countries could be undermined by unilateral action is now over, and anyone attempting to take such action will face broad and resolute resistance. The Foreign Secretary also discussed the issue of the British government's negotiations with other countries, saying that the government has worked hard to study the special circumstances of the countries it has contacted and has tried to make some practical contacts on certain practical issues. As for the discussions currently underway, I regret that I cannot provide details. Regarding Poland, the Foreign Secretary recalled the declaration issued by Prime Minister Chamberlain on April 6 with the agreement of Polish Foreign Minister Beck. The guarantee given to Poland in this declaration and its reciprocal nature, it is hoped that a permanent treaty between the two countries will be concluded soon. The guarantees we have given to Romania and Greece are all unilateral and need no further explanation at this time. The application of these guarantees will be the same as that given to Poland. If the independence of Romania or Greece is clearly threatened, and the Romanian or Greek government believes that it must resist with all the strength of the country, then Britain will step in to help. Regarding Turkey, the first stage of negotiations was successfully completed on May 12. The British government issued a declaration on the compromise reached at that time and is now actively engaged in the continued consultations stipulated in the declaration. I hope to be able to announce the successful conclusion of these consultations to the House of Commons soon (cheers). The friendly and cooperative attitude shown by Turkey in the discussions has greatly satisfied the British government and the entire country. This is truly a good omen for peace in the Mediterranean region and Southeast Europe. As for the Soviet Union, the British government has decided to send a representative from the Foreign Office to Moscow to speed up the British-Soviet negotiations. The actions taken by the British government in recent weeks mark a meaningful starting point for British foreign policy. In general, to the best of our ability, to understand the opinions of other countries and to make other countries understand the opinions of Britain, this is extremely important and must be felt.

Mussolini's Remarks Are Comforting

The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the speech given by Mussolini, saying, "In his speech in Turin, Mr. Mussolini said that millions of people are now asking us whether we are on the road to war. In fact, there is no issue that can trigger war." I am very pleased to hear this. However, if such issues are to be resolved through negotiation, both sides must have good intentions, be prepared to accommodate the opinions of others, and have the confidence to abide by their promises to others.

Britain Does Not Hinder Germany's Economy

Next, he mentioned Germany, saying, "We never want to hinder Germany in the economic field, because we know that a prosperous Germany can benefit Europe as a whole. The only desire of the British government is to use its full strength to seek a peaceful solution. However, the era in which the independence of European countries can be undermined by unilateral action is now over, and anyone attempting to take such action will surely face broad and resolute resistance. If the independence of all countries is recognized, then the British government is not only willing but also eager to develop the entire economic situation. This is not only the case for Germany, but also for all other countries in Europe."

The Success of an International Conference Is Uncertain

Regarding the possibility of convening an international conference to seek a solution to the current international situation, the conference itself, regardless of its appeal to natural emotions and impulses, is doubtful whether it can provide any remedy. The events to be considered at the conference are not all demands from Germany. Britain also hopes to adjust demands that are opposed to Germany on the basis of preserving lasting peace. We believe that such events can be resolved through negotiation without resorting to force, because it is difficult to carry on international life as usual without other conditions.

I Dare Not Agree That War is Inevitable

Those who believe that war cannot be avoided, I dare not lightly agree with this. The various complex problems in Europe today can easily lead to war if handled recklessly. Moreover, today there are several people who have full authority to make conflicts more acute. If disputes remain as connected as before, then regardless of who wins or loses the war, or how long the war lasts, I have no doubt about its final outcome. Resistance is inevitable, and the terrible consequences of war are known to all, and the desire of the people of all countries for peace and their willingness to see all disputes resolved through negotiation should be known to all. At this time, if those who hope to resort to force to achieve their goals are once aware of the other side's integrity and still do not feel that resolving the unavoidable difficulties in adjusting demands and adapting to new circumstances through negotiation is a wiser and more beneficial approach, then I can hardly believe it.

Negotiations with the Soviet Union Still Have Difficulties

At the beginning of his speech, Halifax declared, "Regarding our combination with the Soviet Union, I have discussed it with French cabinet members in Paris and Geneva, and I have also had continuous meetings with Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to Britain. As a result, we have put forward a proposal to the Soviet government from Britain and France. In our opinion, this proposal has substantially addressed the points of difficulty that previously arose. However, there are still one or two difficulties to be resolved. Regarding the status of the Baltic countries, we have never attempted to impose guarantees on countries that do not wish to accept guarantees or to take any steps that could in any way prejudice relations with these countries. Our only desire is to maintain their neutrality and prevent them from being invaded. At the same time, we must recognize that from the perspective of the Soviet Union's own security, the Soviet Union cannot be indifferent to the independence of its neighbors. I hope that we can eventually find a way to resolve this difficulty and any other problems that may arise."

British Policy Is Straightforward and Frank

The Foreign Secretary also made the following comments on the general situation: "British policy, in our view, is straightforward and frank, but in the eyes of many thoughtful people in Germany, their feelings may be different, which is probably easy to imagine. I am as shocked by the treatment of the Jews as anyone else. Regardless of Germany's feelings about German-Czech relations after the Munich Conference, I know that there are not a few people who consider the destruction of Czech independence to resolve this problem to be unwise and erroneous. However, I believe that Germans who have this feeling, or who have seen the history of the years after the war, also feel that unless they are prepared to back up their demands with the threat of force, the demands that Germans consider reasonable and just will never be considered by other countries. In fact, the British people have always wanted to reach an understanding with Germany, whenever they considered it possible, that would not only help to resolve special problems but also place the two countries in a secure position of mutual trust. Even today, I think the British people still have this hope. At the same time, I think it should be clarified that the British people, no less than their friends across the Channel, are equally prepared and determined to make all necessary contributions to maintaining their way of life and defending their position in the world."

Doors Are Still Open Everywhere

Halifax went on to say about anti-aggression guarantees and what Germany calls "encirclement," saying that if the leaders of all countries do not intend to use the oppression of superior force to force a solution, then anti-aggression guarantees will never be put into practice. The path to new opportunities that can benefit all parties is still open. In this unstable world, if there is one thing that is certain, it is that Britain and France will never take aggressive actions against the independence and security of any other country, or attack by indirect methods. Lord Snell, who initiated the debate on diplomatic events, said that the government, driven by the situation, has finally accepted the main principle of collective security, but the delay in the establishment of the British-Soviet agreement has at least had a disturbing impact. The situation in the Far East is even more unsatisfactory. He did not want to criticize the Foreign Secretary, but the Foreign Secretary's reply to the appeal made by the Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun in Geneva was disturbingly lacking in sympathy. Halifax said in his reply that he expected all Spanish foreign troops to withdraw soon. (Reuters, 8th)

British-German Misunderstandings Can Still Be Resolved

It seems that the German nation believes that Britain is no longer willing to establish an understanding with Germany, but this misunderstanding is a dangerous factor in the European situation. In fact, the British nation has in the past sought to establish an understanding with Germany based on a heart of mutual trust, and this is still the case today. Even in the European War and after the end of the war, finding various errors, Britain is willing to take responsibility for them and, thinking that what should be corrected, is eager to correct them, to establish a new era of friendship with the German nation. Before, in early March 1936, after Germany abolished the Locarno Pact, the German authorities stated that the period of various unexpected actions had passed. Also, in March 1938, after the German-Austrian merger, it was declared that there were no more territorial demands in Europe. When it came to September of last year, the Munich Agreement was signed and established, and a solution was found for the Sudetenland issue. Britain and Germany also issued a joint declaration on September 30, proclaiming their desire for peace. At that time, although there was no lack of anxiety among the British nation, it was also felt that Germany's views had never been accepted by Britain, and it also tried to understand them. It is a pity that not long after, the German Jews were mistreated, and the conscience of the people of the world was shaken. Soon after, Germany occupied the Czech Republic by surprise and destroyed its independence. Most people were terrified, and the more they said that this might be the initial method of using force to dominate Europe. Most countries, frightened by this latent crisis, approached each other, which is the norm of human nature. (Havas, 8th)

### Germany Criticizes, Italy Welcomes

(Berlin) Responsible figures here say that British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's speech is the result of certain countries beginning to feel doubts about the anti-aggression front. A certain spokesman said that some countries feel that the anti-aggression policy has a kind of ambiguous state. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax must think that he should now make Britain's desire for peace shine more brightly. In short, Halifax is trying to make the word "peace" have vitality again. (Reuters, 9th)

(Berlin) Berlin newspapers criticized British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's comments yesterday expressing their desire to have friendly relations with Germany in a satirical tone, saying that Britain's encirclement policy is completely contrary to these hypocritical comments. If Chamberlain and Halifax truly desire peace, then they must change their plans and match their words with their actions. (Reuters, 9th)

(Rome) The speech given by British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in the British House of Lords yesterday is of great interest to the newspapers here, and they have all given it as much coverage as possible, without any depreciatory remarks, and believe that it has great significance "in principle," and say that Foreign Secretary Halifax's intention is that no matter what the outcome of the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the doors for Britain to negotiate with other countries should still be left open. This layer is especially noteworthy. When the Foreign Secretary gave his speech, the members of the House of Lords repeatedly applauded him, which is reasonable. A reporter stationed in London for a certain newspaper also telegraphed that political figures in Britain believe that this speech, since March of this year, that is, since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, is the first speech that is suitable for reality and has common sense. (Havas, 9th)

### Halifax Meets with Soviet Ambassador, Explains Sending Envoy to Moscow

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon and stated that due to the current international situation, he could not personally travel to Moscow. Therefore, he has dispatched Mr. Strang, the head of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, to the Soviet Union to assist Ambassador Seeds. The current negotiations will still be presided over by Ambassador Seeds. Well-informed sources commented that the future of Anglo-Soviet negotiations is very optimistic. The British government has decided to satisfy the Soviet Union on the following two points: First, the draft Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, which mentions the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, will be cancelled due to Soviet opposition. Second, in times of emergency, the three signatory countries do not need to exchange opinions in advance and should immediately implement mutual assistance. Regarding the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states, Britain advocates that the three signatory countries should each unilaterally issue a declaration stating their "vital interests" and that the other two countries should accept them. If these interests are threatened, the other two countries should immediately provide assistance. Based on this, although the mutual assistance agreement does not explicitly mention the Baltic states, the Soviet Union can declare that if these countries are threatened, the Soviet Union's vital interests are also threatened, and Britain and France will have to come to the aid. This approach should satisfy the Soviet Union and be beneficial to the conclusion of the agreement. (Havas, 8th)

(London) Mr. Strang, the head of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, arrived here this afternoon from Warsaw. He immediately went to the Foreign Office to receive instructions and will go to Moscow before the 11th of this month to assist Ambassador Seeds in the negotiations. At the same time, the British and French governments are maintaining close contact through diplomatic channels. French Ambassador Corbin visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday and met with Foreign Office Under-Secretary Sir Cadogan today. British Ambassador to France Sir Phipps also held talks with French Foreign Minister Bonnet. (Havas, 8th)

### Czech Resistance to Germany Intensifies: One German Police Officer Killed, Conflicts Erupt in Tavern

(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency (DNB) issued a message stating: "Last night, in the town of Klatovy, not far west of Prague, a German police officer was shot and killed by an unknown assailant. Afterwards, Neurath, the 'Protector' of Bohemia and Moravia, immediately took all necessary measures, including prohibiting public gatherings, temporarily closing all cinemas, theaters, and other public entertainment venues, and ordering the closure of all public schools due to the incitement of teachers. In addition, residents must keep their windows tightly closed between 8:00 PM and 5:00 AM the next morning. German police will open fire on anyone who opens them without authorization. Furthermore, the chairman and all members of the Klatovy City Council have been dismissed and replaced by a committee. Czech police have been disarmed for dereliction of duty. If the murderer is not apprehended by the 9th of this month, Neurath will take further measures." (Havas, 8th)

Prague: Since the murder of a German police officer in Klatovy, the German authorities have taken the most severe measures and offered a reward of 30,000 crowns for the capture of the murderer. Czech Prime Minister General Elias traveled to Klatovy this morning to investigate the situation. In addition, an incident occurred in a tavern in this city last night. Czech and German customers were chatting in the tavern, using the recent football match between the Czech and German teams as a topic of conversation. The Czech team had won, and the Czechs could not help but show their joy, which angered the Germans. A German soldier in plain clothes drew a pistol but was disarmed by the Czechs. The soldier suffered minor facial injuries. Another German soldier also tried to draw a gun but was also disarmed by the Czechs. German police arrived after hearing the news and immediately arrested several Czechs and sealed off the tavern. After this incident, the Czech nation was very agitated. The German authorities have taken various measures to maintain order. (Havas, 9th)

### Britain and America's Emphasis on Peaceful Means Sets a Good Example for the World: President Roosevelt's Toast at the Banquet for the British King, Expected Further Cooperation Between the Two Countries to Protect Interests in the Pacific

(Washington) President Roosevelt hosted a grand banquet at the White House last night to entertain the King and Queen of England. During the banquet, President Roosevelt first gave a welcome speech, stating: "Our two countries have contributed greatly to world civilization and human welfare, and the relationship between us is worthy of being a model. There are no fortifications along our borders, we have no fear of aggression, and we do not compete in armaments. I recall the dispute over the sovereignty of Canton Island and Enderbury Island in the Pacific, which was resolved through friendly negotiations, establishing a system of joint rule for a period of fifty years. This is an example of abandoning force and valuing peaceful methods. If all countries in the world could imitate this, the international situation would be stabilized, and mankind could live in a happy, prosperous, and peaceful world." (Havas)

The King replied, thanking the President for the kind invitation and welcome, and said that he and the Queen were deeply moved by the hospitality in Washington. He hoped to spend a pleasant and fulfilling time during his stay in the United States. He extended warm greetings from Canada, a neighbor and friend of the United States, and expressed the highest sincerity and dedication on behalf of Britain, wishing President Roosevelt good health and happiness. He firmly believed that the United States would continue its history, distinguished by order, progress, and prosperity, just like the past history of the United States. He further wished that the two great nations would continue to move forward in a peaceful world, following friendly paths. (Reuters, 8th)

(Washington) At the grand banquet for the British King and the American President at the White House last night, the King and the President both stood up and raised their glasses to each other, vowing to strengthen the ties between Britain and the United States and work for world peace. At that time, the President further explained the cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East. Roosevelt used the joint management of the two Pacific islands by Britain and the United States as an example, stating that he hoped that all countries could resolve disputes through peaceful means. After the President's remarks, non-official sources predicted that Britain and the United States would cooperate more closely to establish a more stable balance of power in the Pacific. General observers believe that the President's remarks today indicate that Britain and the United States will further discuss various issues between the two countries in the Pacific. These issues will include: Maintaining the Open Door Policy in China, protecting the Philippines, guaranteeing the trade routes from the United States to the East Indies, defending Australia, and developing Pacific aviation routes. It is widely believed that the interests of the United States in the Pacific are expanding, and the US government will discuss various rights and interests in the Far East with the British side. (Associated Press, 9th)

(Washington) Diplomatic circles today firmly believe that the King and Queen's visit to the United States can inspire the democratic spirit of the Americas and encourage the American republics to continue to evolve along the traditional republican lines. Diplomatic circles also believe that the King and Queen's unprecedented entry into the American frontier shows that Britain and the United States intend to deepen their relationship based on friendship and mutual interests. This policy is usually referred to as "parallel," but in a technical sense, it is not an alliance. From the perspective of the grand vision of the Western Hemisphere, this policy means that Britain and the United States will develop naval policies in parallel and intend to continue to support the Monroe Doctrine, as they did when the doctrine was announced in 1823. Thus, the Latin American countries under the protection of the British and American navies will continue to receive a defensive shield to resist any aggression. This shield to protect the Western Hemisphere may extend beyond the American republics, because President Roosevelt advocates that the United States cannot stand idly by if Canada is invaded. Therefore, the United States must extend its defense to the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and the Pacific. Furthermore, the King and Queen's visit to the United States comes after the signing of the Anglo-American reciprocal treaty, which guarantees a permanent "most-favored-nation" commercial system for Latin America and provides a substantial guarantee of the principle of free exchange in most of the world. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Unprecedented Grandeur of the Welcome Ceremony

(Washington) King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England arrived at Washington Station yesterday from Niagara Falls. President Roosevelt greeted them with a democratic and sincere greeting, saying, "How are you?" The American people expressed their welcome with loud shouts, and the military fired salutes in salute. After the King and Queen got off the special train, they walked on a blue-and-white star carpet to the reception room inside the station. Naval officers standing on both sides saluted with their guns. Those waiting in the reception room included the President and his wife and many high-ranking officials. Although the form of the welcome emphasized diplomatic etiquette, the shouts of the crowd were incessant. When the King arrived at the reception room, the President said, "How are you? I am very happy to see you." The King smiled and exchanged a few words of greeting, but his voice was very low and difficult for others to hear. The President then sincerely stepped forward and shook hands with the King. Then the King turned around and introduced the Queen to the President and his wife, and they exchanged handshakes. Yesterday, the King wore a gold-colored naval admiral's uniform, the President wore a black morning suit, and the Queen and the First Lady wore blue velvet robes (the blue velvet robes were presented by wool merchants from Britain and the United States). The King, Queen, President Roosevelt, and other officials and ladies then proceeded to the square in front of the station at 12:11 PM yesterday to review the troops, and the 600,000 people standing around immediately shouted loudly. At the same time, the American naval band played the national anthems of Britain and the United States. The King returned the salute by raising his hand, and the President raised his top hat to his chest. In addition, the American artillery fired a 21-gun salute. The crowd surrounding the King was so large that it was almost impossible to move. Afterwards, the King and others took cars to the White House, the President's residence. The crowds gathered along the way were countless. Those seeking profit rented out windows facing the street to spectators for as much as $15 per person. The King's and President's cars were in the front, and the Queen's and First Lady's cars followed behind. Yesterday, the scorching sun was out in full force, and the weather was hot, with the temperature on the streets reaching 89 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the car tops were not up, and the people on the roadside were extremely crowded, so the King used a parasol to block the sunlight. While the two heads of state and the most prominent ladies were chatting casually in the car, planes from the army and navy were flying in formation overhead. Soldiers from the army and navy were stationed every four feet along the way, saluting with their guns. Armored vehicles and cavalrymen guarded the front and rear of the car. The King frequently returned the salute to the crowd in the car, and the Queen often raised her parasol. Finally, at 12:50 PM yesterday, the King and Queen arrived at the White House and planned to stay in the Presidential Palace for 36 hours. The King's visit to the White House is a historic first. The King and Queen were accompanied by Secretary of State Hull into the Presidential Reception Room. Those waiting to greet them in the reception room, in addition to the President, included the Vice President and other important government figures, including Senator Pittman, Army Chief of Staff General Craig, Naval Technical Director Admiral Leahy, Undersecretary of State Welles, etc. Today, the King and Queen will meet with British expatriates at the British Embassy, and at the same time, they will meet with important figures from the Senate and House of Representatives at the White House. This morning, the King and Queen will inspect the Washington Naval Shipyard, and then board the President's private yacht to Mount Vernon to pay tribute to President Washington's tomb with wreaths. After dining on the President's private yacht, the King and Queen will return to Washington by car, and then review the militia at Fort Myer and pay tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Tonight, the King and Queen will host a banquet for the Roosevelts at the British Embassy. At 11:30 PM, they will take a car to New York. At 8:00 AM on Saturday, the King's car will arrive at Ryder's Point, where they will change cars to Hartak Fort, and then take a destroyer from the fort to the top of New York City. Those waiting to greet the King in New York include Mayor LaGuardia, etc. After arriving in New York, the King will be accompanied by the Mayor on a half-hour tour of the streets in a military vehicle to thank the countless New Yorkers for their warm welcome. A million schoolchildren will cheer and salute in the streets. At 11:00 AM on Saturday morning, the King and Queen will visit the World's Fair and dine at City Hall. After lunch, they will visit the exhibits of Britain, Ireland, and other countries at the Fair. At 2:40 PM, the King and Queen will visit Columbia University. At 5:15 PM, they will take a transfer to Hyde Park to rest at the Roosevelt residence. (Associated Press, 9th)

### British Military Attaché Spears Detained by Japanese Troops: Detention Site on the Ping-Sui Railway Line, Japanese Side Claims Right to Detain for Questioning

The North China communication of the Tzu Lin Bao dated June 2 states that Colonel Spears, the British military attaché, set out from Chongqing to travel in China. He was arrested by the Japanese authorities when he arrived at the Japanese army's front line. The newspapers here have criticized this incident. As of today, the newspapers know the following:

The British Embassy here had predicted some time ago that Colonel Spears had left Chongqing two months ago, was traveling in the Chinese-controlled area, was expected to arrive in North China soon, and planned to arrive in the Western Hills guerrilla area, less than ten miles from Mentougou, the Japanese army's forward outpost west of Beiping, but had to turn back due to the fighting between the guerrillas and the Japanese army. However, Colonel Spears managed to send a message stating that he would take another route, namely, the Pingzhang Railway further north. Therefore, Lieutenant Cooper, an interpreter at the British Embassy, was sent to travel along the railway, hoping to contact Colonel Spears. Before Lieutenant Cooper set off, he visited the Japanese authorities in Beiping to apply for travel permits for himself and Colonel Spears. The Japanese authorities said that Lieutenant Cooper's travel permit would be issued later, but they refused to issue Colonel Spears' travel permit, because Colonel Spears had not yet obtained a Japanese travel permit, and even then, it was not necessary. Therefore, Lieutenant Cooper did not obtain a travel permit and set off along the Zhangjiakou Railway. After that, there was no news of him. Five days later, on the 30th, the "Xinmin Bao," controlled by the Japanese, published a telegram stating that the Japanese garrison in Shuangshu Village, south of the Xiahuayuan on the Pingsui Railway, had captured a suspicious foreigner in the local Catholic Church. The person was ragged and looked like a rogue. Because Shuangshu Village is under the jurisdiction of Zhangjiakou, the captured person was handed over to the Zhangjiakou Japanese Military Police Department to determine his nationality and inquire about his itinerary. The foreigner claimed that he had close ties with General Chiang Kai-shek and was a military attaché from a third country, not a Communist. He had traveled north from Chongqing via Kunming and Hanoi. Because of the bravery of the Japanese army, he had sneaked into Chahar from Hebei. Before arriving in Hebei, he had seen the Japanese army fighting in Shanxi. The Zhangjiakou Japanese Military Police Department is continuing to investigate this foreigner. On the day this news was published, the Japanese spokesman knew about the matter, but when more telegrams were received, he admitted it, but refused to confirm or deny that the arrested foreigner was a British military attaché. Foreign reporters questioned him, and the spokesman angrily replied that the Japanese army had full authority to detain and question foreigners passing through enemy lines in order to extract information from them. The British Embassy authorities are convinced that the suspicious foreigner must be Colonel Spears. One afternoon, Assistant Chinese Secretary Lamb and Major Daraman of the British garrison in Tianjin, after some delay, obtained the necessary permission from the Japanese commander and went to Zhangjiakou to meet Colonel Spears and search for Lieutenant Cooper, because they had not heard from Lieutenant Cooper after he set off. The Japanese spokesman also confirmed that the person arrested was a British military attaché, and the reason he gave for the arrest was that the situation was very special when Colonel Spears arrived at the Japanese front line, and the Japanese army had full authority to treat this person as a suspicious person. (It should be mentioned that Colonel Spears had a passport with him, according to what is known.) The spokesman added that the case was very complicated and that the Beiping Japanese Military Command was still awaiting an official report. Jinhua communication: After the Japanese army occupied the three prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, the entire western Zhejiang has become a guerrilla area. In order to plunder, the Japanese army ordered the puppet organizations in western Zhejiang to collect various donations and taxes, and to implement a public sale of opium. The main points are described below:

Consolidated Tax: The consolidated tax is the income of the puppet "Renovation Government," and is collected by the Puppet Government's General Taxation Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Tax branches are set up in each district. The tax is levied at 7.5% of the value of the goods. The names of the goods are not detailed.

Stamp Duty on Tobacco and Alcohol:

This is a provincial tax, collected by the Zhejiang Provincial Stamp Duty on Tobacco and Alcohol Office set up by the puppet provincial government. The tax rates are not detailed.

Tin Foil Tax:

Tin foil is mostly produced in Shaoxing and Hangzhou. The Shaoxing products are the best, followed by Hangzhou products. The puppet provincial government has now established the Jiangzhe Tin Foil Special Tax General Bureau in Hangzhou, and a collection office in Shanghai, with a monthly revenue of 6,000 yuan, which is delivered to the puppet Ministry of Finance.

Public Sale of Opium:

The puppet provincial government has established a Prohibition of Opium General Bureau, and each county has established a Prohibition of Opium Branch Bureau. In name, it prohibits opium, but in reality, it is a public sale. The Prohibition of Opium Branch Bureau in each county is concurrently managed by the puppet county government or the puppet police station. The prohibition of opium in Hangzhou City and County is handled by the puppet General Bureau. The income from various public sales fees is distributed according to provinces and counties. The details are as follows: (A) Registration fee for opium smokers, one dime per application. (B) Opium smoker license fee, 1.5 yuan per quarter. (The application and license fees are provincial income in the General Bureau and county income in the Branch Bureau.) (C) Opium stamp duty. The General Bureau has set up opium (called "tobacco cessation medicine" by the puppet authorities) manufacturing plants and monopoly sales offices. In addition to collecting the prescribed tobacco price, a stamp duty of three yuan is levied on each tael of opium. The stamp is issued by the General Bureau. Two-thirds of the stamp duty revenue is provincial income, and one-third is city and county income. (D) Donation of license certificates for opium distribution stations. Opium distribution stations and sales treatment centers are specially allowed to be established in the location of the provincial and county opium prohibition bureaus. Each distribution station should at least sell 1,000 taels of opium per month, and pay a monthly donation of 100 yuan for the license certificate, and so on (that is, a donation of 10% of the licensed sales volume is collected for the license certificate). (E) Business license donation for opium sales treatment centers. Each center should pay a business license donation in accordance with its grade every month, with the highest donation amount being 20 yuan. (The above two license certificate donations are provincial income in the General Bureau and county income in the Branch Bureau.) (F) Income from auction of smuggled goods and fines. The proceeds from the sale of confiscated smuggled soil and opium paste, and the fines paid after sentencing, in addition to subsidizing the public expenses of the trial organs and sharing the awards, the rest is the income of the city and county.

Field Tax and Land Price Tax:

The puppet county government compiles and collects field tax. The situation varies from county to county, but most of them are collected by the mu. Because the Japanese puppets only occupy cities and towns, and the four villages are under the control of the guerrillas, the puppet side does not dare to send people to the countryside to urge the collection. Therefore, the field tax income of the puppet county government in each county is very small. The puppet municipal government of Hangzhou City has been preparing to collect the land price tax for the first half of the 28th year since April 16.

Empty House Rent:

After the Japanese occupied various cities and towns, most of the people fled abroad. The Japanese puppets came up with the idea of ​​organizing empty house registration and implementing empty room rentals. Hangzhou City stipulated that the period from March 1 to April 30 was the registration period for empty houses, and the implementation of empty room rentals would begin on May 1. According to the results of the survey of existing houses compiled by the puppet Hangzhou Municipal Government, there are: 850 households of shops, 5,551 households of residential houses, and 3,815 empty rooms, a total of 10,125 households. The number of empty houses is far more than the number of shops and residential houses. The income from empty room rentals must be considerable. It is estimated that there are three types of income from empty room rentals: 1. Empty room registration fee, 50 cents per household, 2. Application fee for renting empty rooms, 2 yuan per application, 3. Rent, estimated by the shop and residential house valuation committee, paid monthly, and one month's rent must be prepaid when entering the house.

Tea Bowl Donation:

There are many tea houses, large and small, in the towns and villages of western Zhejiang. Tea houses also operate gambling dens, brothels, and opium dens, so the business is not bad, and the income from tea bowl donations is also considerable. For example, the donation rate for tea bowls in the Pingdiao District of Hangzhou County is divided into five grades: Grade A is 4 yuan per month, Grade B is 3 yuan per month, Grade C is 2 yuan per month, Grade D is 1 yuan per month, and Grade E is 50 cents per month.

Shop and Residential House Donation:

Shops pay 15% of the rent each month, and residential houses pay 10%. It was originally stipulated that the owner should pay 70% and the tenant 30%, but in practice, most of it is borne by the tenant. In addition, the organs below the puppet county government in each county have many kinds of miscellaneous taxes, including cargo tax, slaughter tax, self-defense donation, street light donation, ship license fee, good citizen certificate fee (now changed to household registration certificate), vehicle donation, vehicle license fee, and beggar donation, etc. The situation varies from place to place, but it is nothing more than exploitation as much as possible, so there is no need to describe them in detail.

### Guerrillas Destroy Puppet Tax Card on the Qinghu Road, Puppet Director Seriously Injured

Qingpu communication: The Xujing Station on the Qinghu Road west of Shanghai, which was set up by the puppet Qingpu County Government last spring as a "tax card," requires merchants and civilians to pay taxes for transporting goods, and even pedestrians must pay a road maintenance fee of 20 cents. In the past, the Japanese side specially dispatched more than 20 Japanese troops to guard the station together with Qiu Yongsi, the puppet tax collector. Recently, due to the Japanese side's assessment of the active Chinese army west of Shanghai, the Japanese troops were ordered to stay at the Hongqiao Airport at night. On the evening of the 7th, the Wang Department of the guerrillas stationed near Qibao took advantage of the emptiness to attack and completely destroyed the puppet tax card. The puppet tax collectors Qiu Yongsi and others were seriously injured. After the guerrillas completed their mission, they immediately retreated.

The Japanese army stationed in Qingpu ordered Zhu, the puppet propaganda director, to write peace slogans in red and green paper and post them all over the city and in the suburbs. The general meaning is to support Wang Jingwei's peace with Japan.

### Japanese Aircraft Flying Over Outside of Zhenhai Port Spontaneously Combusts and Falls into Jintang Sea

Immediately, the head of the aircraft had blazing flames, the tail smoked, and in an instant it fell into the sea near Jintang, and floated away with the tide without a trace. When the masses saw this situation, they all cheered.

### Currency Shortage Has Not Shaken the Foreign Exchange Market; It is Gradually Calming Down; All Legitimate Needs Are Still Being Supplied; Control Will Continue Once a New Level is Reached

(Special dispatch from our Hong Kong office, 9th) This morning, the Hong Kong currency price rebounded to 48. General observers said that it is possible to rebound to 50. Financial circles are informed that the government has a proper way to deal with the depreciation of the currency. Authoritative sources said that in the past few weeks, the Chinese currency balance fund has not had any difficulties, and the currency has not been shaken. However, the temporary suspension of control a few days ago was to allow the exchange rate to reach a more suitable economic level in order to balance trade. The same measures were taken in June last year, when the level price was eight pence, and this price was successfully maintained for a year. Now a new level has been discovered and can be firmly supported, which can be deeply believed. After banks such as HSBC restrict the supply of foreign exchange outside the black market, they still supply as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries based on orders, aiming to prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market and Japanese people from arbitrage. At the same time, the Central Bank also supplies statutory foreign exchange as usual. Therefore, since yesterday, the public in Shanghai has been at peace, rumors have subsided, and foreign exchange prices have also stabilized slightly. The details are as follows.

Foreign Exchange Applications Processed as Usual

Foreign banks that operate foreign exchange, such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Great Britain, supply foreign exchange to legitimate merchants as usual based on orders, aiming to prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market and Japanese people from being unable to arbitrage. As for the Central Bank, for all goods imported with government approval, it still supplies the statutory foreign exchange of one shilling and two and a half pence. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank still handles foreign exchange applications as usual every week. Yesterday was Friday, the day the bank approved and released applications. However, because the review was very strict, the number of approvals was very small.

Truth Revealed, Public Sentiment Stabilized

Since the unprecedented tightening of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market began on the 7th of this month, there have been many rumors in the market, and speculators have taken the opportunity to manipulate and profit. Now that the truth about the restriction of foreign exchange supply has been revealed, the rumors have been proven to be unfounded, and China's foreign exchange fund is still abundant, enough to maintain foreign exchange during the war of resistance. At the same time, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee has explained the unreliability of the rumors. Therefore, since yesterday, the public in the market has been at peace, the rumors have subsided, and foreign exchange prices have also stabilized slightly. Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rate for the British currency was six and a half pence, and the US currency was twelve yuan and six jiao and two and a half fen, which was the same as the previous day.

Resumption of Supply in Due Course

According to banking sources yesterday, the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee held a meeting on the 7th of this month to study the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market. It is reported that this decision to temporarily suspend assistance to the black market foreign exchange is to prevent Japanese arbitrage and promote trade balance, so as to reduce the import surplus of Shanghai Customs. Once the exchange rate reaches the horizontal line, supply and maintenance will be restored immediately. That is, if someone throws it out, the committee will buy it, and if there is revenue, the committee will sell it, so as to stabilize the black market foreign exchange. The above measures are beneficial to China's wartime finance.

Import Merchants Meet to Discuss Remedies

The sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market has a significant impact on the future of import merchants' business. For importers who have ordered goods but have not purchased foreign exchange, the losses are very large. Although the exchange rate has stabilized slightly since yesterday, it is one and a half pence lower compared to before the 7th. It is impossible to predict whether it will be able to return to the state before the 7th in the future. Therefore, an important foreign firm of import merchants held an informal meeting yesterday to discuss remedies for the current tightening of the exchange market. It is heard that they unanimously hope that the Chinese government will quickly maintain it to avoid unexpected losses to importers.

Accurate Ratio Has Not Reached the Level

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that the volatility of the exchange market in this city has returned to calm this morning (9th). As of noon, the stabilization fund had not yet resumed selling foreign exchange through HSBC and Mercantile Bank, because the current accurate exchange rate has not yet fallen to the new level set by the fund. However, the above-mentioned two banks have hinted to customers and other banks that the fund seems to sell foreign exchange when the British exchange rate shrinks to six pence and five yuan, and the US exchange rate reaches twelve yuan, sixty-two and a half yuan. At the time of closing, the two exchange rates were still zero six two higher than the new level, and the fund had the image of re-intervening and selling foreign exchange. The market has been guaranteed again, and many buyers have also stopped or reduced their foreign exchange applications. At that time, the fund's foreign exchange allocation will be restricted and reserved for later. The Chinese government has not yet made a clear statement on this aspect. This morning, the yen was stronger in the local exchange market, with exchange shops buying at nine jiao and nine fen and five yuan and selling at one yuan and five fen.

### Ministry of Finance Maintains Creditworthiness and Unifies the Type E Bonds to be Drawn Today for a Total Principal Repayment of 2.08 Million Yuan, Payable on July 31

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has decided that the government will continue to subsidize the revolving repayment of principal and interest of bonds guaranteed by customs duties, which will be paid on July 3

After the bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications make the payment, the new 　　　　 Yesterday, it was learned from the National Debt Fund Management Committee that the lottery of Type A, B, C, and D bonds of the unified public debt has been held separately. As for Type E bonds, eight lottery tickets will be drawn at the Bankers Association at 10:00 am today, with a total principal repayment of 2.08 million yuan. Letters have been sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, the local court, etc. to send personnel to monitor at that time.

### British Ambassador's Trip to Chongqing is Unbelievable

British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, in addition to attending a luncheon at the British Consulate on the 8th to celebrate the birthday of King George VI, also held a garden party at the ambassador's private residence on Dunxin Road in the afternoon to entertain consuls from various countries and extend their congratulations. Regarding the rumor that the British ambassador will leave Shanghai in mid-June, according to sources at the British Embassy, the ambassador has no intention of going to Chongqing, and no decision has been made yet. This statement is not credible.

### The Public Works Department Investigates the American Literature Strike and Plans to Implement Mediation to Avoid Escalation of Disputes

The American Literature Silk Weaving Factory on Xiaoshabo Road in this city has a total of more than 300 male and female workers. The relationship between labor and management has always been harmonious. Recently, the factory suddenly announced on the morning of the 7th of this month that it would lay off more than 100 workers and close the factory gate to prevent workers from entering the factory to work. When all the workers heard the news, they were panicked. They immediately petitioned the factory to request permission to resume work, but to no avail. The workers then gathered at a certain place to discuss and elected five representatives to petition the Public Works Department on the afternoon of the 8th, requesting impartial assistance. The director of the Industrial Section received them. The workers' representatives first stated the process of being laid off and made two requests: (1) Restore the work of the laid-off workers, and (2) During the shutdown period, the factory will provide subsidies. The Public Works Department agreed to investigate and handle it. Yesterday morning, the bureau sent Gu Bingchen to the factory to investigate, and it is heard that it will convene both parties for mediation to avoid escalation of the situation and affect public security.

### Copper Coins Have Been Collected and Exhausted; The National Government Decides to Issue Copper Subsidiary Coin Vouchers; Traitorous Merchants Collect and Sell to a Certain Party; The Central Bank Suspends Supply to Businesses and the Public; Temporary Inconvenience for Small Change

In view of the soaring price of copper overseas and the profiteering of traitorous merchants who secretly transport copper coins for export, the Ministry of Finance, in order to preserve currency materials and military industrial materials, has ordered the customs to strictly investigate and deal with the matter. In addition, because traitorous merchants are used to buy copper coins to supply a certain party with military industrial materials, which not only disrupts finance and destroys currency policy, but also affects the War of Resistance. If they are not severely punished, it is not enough to punish traitors and deter them. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that any traitorous merchant who buys one-cent or half-cent copper coins and old copper yuan will be confiscated and confiscated in full if it is found that they are resold to others or smuggled for export, and will be punished for disrupting finance in accordance with the regulations on punishing traitors. Since the implementation, the smuggling of copper yuan has disappeared. However, Shanghai, because it belongs to a fallen area, is beyond the power of the government under special circumstances, and the Jianghai Customs is forced to be unable to implement the order. General traitorous merchants take advantage of the environment to collect huge amounts of money and sell it to a certain party, which is loaded on wheels and exported from Hongkou. This has been going on for a long time, and the number is alarming, so that one-cent and half-cent copper coins and old copper yuan in the market are collected and exhausted. At the same time, the Central Bank, in view of this situation, has suspended the transport of new subsidiary coins to Shanghai for supply. All industries are affected by the purchase of good merchants, and all transactions are very inconvenient. They have no choice but to use stamps and banknotes to replace copper coins for circulation. Public buses have re-issued and circulated the coins that were previously issued as substitutes for copper yuan. Each tram hopes that passengers will bring copper coins to purchase tickets when taking the bus. As for the beggars on the road, they are also affected by the lack of copper yuan. It is heard that the listed price of copper yuan in the money industry is 300 copper coins for 100 copper coins, but the actual market price is 2,500 wen for copper yuan and 95 copper coins for subsidiary coins.

Difficult to Convert

According to the impression obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter in the market yesterday, some people exchanged a one-jiao subsidiary coin voucher for seven fen of copper subsidiary coins at a cigarette shop, and some used one yuan of national currency to exchange for 270 copper coins. Those who refuse to exchange for masters and guests because of the lack of copper subsidiary coins are also common. What I saw in the vegetable market was that I had to buy something worth more than five cents to get change in copper subsidiary coins. The same is true for shops.

Walking on Foot

Tram public words, also because of the lack of copper subsidiary coins, the ticket seller will politely refuse to board passengers who do not bring copper subsidiary coins. Passengers in this situation can only walk on foot, but the journey is long and those who are not used to walking are very hard. Public buses have used the previous price chips for circulation, so they can still cope.

What Was Seen in the Market

Because of the above situation, the inconvenience and pain felt by the citizens is very great. Most shops use stamps as substitutes to cope with customers, and some print a kind of price voucher to replace chips below one jiao for circulation. However, most shops still cannot solve the problem of finding change, and their business is also affected accordingly. Small vendors are the worst, and beggars are even more affected because no one gives alms.

New Vouchers Will Be Issued

Finally, according to the exploration of the Datong News Agency reporter, the government has decided to issue three kinds of subsidiary coin vouchers of one fen, two fen, and five fen to meet the needs of Shanghai. It is found that in various places in eastern Zhejiang, due to the lack of copper subsidiary coins, the Zhejiang Local Bank has long issued three kinds of subsidiary coin vouchers of one fen, two fen, and five fen to meet the needs of the market. Therefore, this move is not difficult. The saying that copper yuan vouchers will be issued is not true.

### Anti-British Movement Rises; Britain Makes Strong Negotiations; The Case Has Been Presented to Miura in Person by the British Consul-General; The Protest Against the Dinggeller Case Was Only Delivered Yesterday

The strike at the Luen Cheung Dyeing and Weaving Company in Pudong is becoming increasingly deadlocked due to the malicious instigation of a certain party. In Pudong, the "New Shanghai Labor Anti-British Alliance" was discovered again, expanding anti-British activities, and forcing ignorant female workers to parade again. Japanese troops are stationed in front of the new Luen Cheung factory, and good workers are unable to return to the factory to resume work. The details are as follows:

Forcing Workers to Participate in Parades

The British-owned Luen Cheung Dyeing and Weaving Company, after firing worker Gu Jingen, which caused a strike, a certain party took the opportunity to instigate, encourage in every possible way, and organize so-called "Strike Committee" and "China Workers' Alliance Committee", etc., to buy ignorant workers with money, obstruct the resumption of work, and attempt to incite an anti-British movement, resulting in the long-term unresolved strike. It is learned that in Pudong, there is recently a so-called "New Shanghai Labor Anti-British Alliance" openly raising the anti-British banner and actively engaging in activities. In addition to sabotaging the resumption of work at Luen Cheung, it also conspires to incite workers at the Gu Zhong factory and other British-owned factories to join the strike. Its ulterior motives directly use workers as its victims.

Forcing Workers to Participate in Parades

The pseudo "Great People's League", etc., in order to curry favor with a certain party and show off their achievements, have repeatedly lured Luen Cheung workers to hold demonstrations. Most workers understand the righteousness and refuse to participate. Only a small number of ignorant female workers are driven by them. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 1:00 pm, the pseudo-party forced ignorant workers to parade again. They started from Dongchang Road and went east through Xinma Road, Laiyidu, Yangjiadu, and then returned to Dongchang Road, distributing absurd leaflets along the way. Pseudo-police assisted. When workers did not want to parade and temporarily withdrew, they were forcibly prevented. Therefore, the expressions of the workers during the parade were extremely reluctant.

Japanese Troops Stationed at the Luen Cheung Factory Gate

Since the conflict at the Luen Cheung Printing Factory, the death of the British engineer Ingler from serious injuries, and the shooting of male workers by pseudo-soldiers, all workers in the two factories have been forced to leave. Japanese naval marines are now stationed in front of the new factory gate, and pseudo-soldiers are guarding outside the old factory gate. Traffic inside and outside the factory has been blocked. General good workers are eager to resume work, but they are unable to enter the factory due to environmental restrictions. It is not known how the strike will end.

British Consul Visits Miura to Negotiate

The Mainland News reported that the British staff member of Luen Cheung Company, Ingler, was fatally stabbed. The British side will submit a formal written protest to the Japanese authorities this morning (9th). The protest has been drafted and was originally scheduled to be submitted yesterday (8th), but it was postponed due to the celebration of the King's birthday. The British authorities said yesterday that they could not disclose the content of the protest. According to news received last night, British Consul-General Phillips visited

Japanese Consul-General Miura

Directly raised verbal negotiations to oppose the Japanese side fueling anti-British disturbances in Pudong. Phillips spoke of the Japanese army's endorsement of labor anti-British disturbances and the incident that occurred at the Luen Cheung Printing Factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, yesterday morning, saying that although the strike at the Bailianjing Printing Factory had been resolved, Japanese people in plain clothes with weapons prevented Chinese workers hired by the British side from returning to the factory, and then asked Miura to take measures to prevent the Japanese from repeating it.

This Kind of Activity

According to earlier news yesterday, Japanese people in plain clothes opened fire to forcibly prevent workers from resuming work, and a Chinese bystander was injured and sent to the Nanshi Hospital. The Japanese side did not mention Phillips' visit to Miura at the reception for reporters last night, but the Japanese naval spokesman said that there was no shooting incident at the Luen Cheung Printing Factory before. "The Japanese authorities are now widely on alert to maintain peace and order in the area." Regarding the anti-British parade that Japanese soldiers participated in yesterday morning, he had no news. Or asked in recent weeks, whether there have been any demonstrations of a fundamentally anti-British nature. The spokesman replied that the striking workers may have demonstrations, but he has no news about this matter. Someone asked if the Japanese authorities would take action to prevent the striking workers from demonstrating. The spokesman replied that, as previously stated, the Japanese army does not mediate between labor and management, but only maintains peace and order. The "Chinese Word Forest Daily" reported that Ingler, a British supervisor at the Luen Cheung Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, fought with Japanese sailors in the factory on Tuesday morning, suffered serious injuries, and died on Wednesday morning. Last night (8th) according to

British Consulate

An official claimed that the British Consulate authorities would lodge a very strong protest with the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Miura regarding Ingler's death. Strong negotiations have been made with the Japanese authorities regarding the anti-British demonstrations in Pudong and the threats to Luen Cheung Company's employees by armed groups, but the protest related to Ingler's death has not yet been filed.

Representatives of Foreign Factories Called to a Meeting

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that representatives of foreign companies with property in Pudong yesterday (8th) went to the Pudong Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters to hold a meeting with Captain Noji of the team. Noji verbally asked the representatives to provide the scheduled time for their employees to travel to and from various factories, so that the Japanese Marine Corps could fully protect these workers. Noji had convened this meeting before the Ingler conflict. At yesterday's meeting, he used a translator to talk to the representatives about suggestions to better protect them during labor disputes, and finally asked the participants to drink beer for the King's birthday. It is heard that the representatives asked Noji to notify them in writing of the information he obtained in detail. After obtaining the detailed report, they will consider the procedures for arranging cooperation with the Japanese side. Ingler's funeral will be held at the Hongqiao Road Cemetery this afternoon. Regarding Ingler's death, the British Consulate authorities have not yet filed a protest, but once all the information they have obtained has been verified, it will be filed.

### Tian Huzi's Troops Recapture Jiufeng; Thousands of Stonemasons Return to Their Hometowns; Japanese Troops Dare Not Easily Re-invade

According to people from Qingpu, after Yuan Yingjie's troops of the guerrillas in the Qingsong Road, Tianmashan, Hengshan, and Xiaokunshan areas were ordered to transfer to the Sujia Road to fight, the defense of the area was empty, and traitors used the line to inform the Songjiang Japanese Military Police Corps, which sent teams to occupy the nine mountains including Tianmashan, Hengshan, Xiaokunshan, Sheshan, Xueshan, Fenghuangshan, Kugongshan, Beiganshan, and Xiaoshan, and forced the original thousands of stonemasons to stop working and block the mountains. Later, the Songjiang defense was empty, and the Japanese soldiers were transferred back. Another gangster, Qu Xueming, was appointed to organize the pseudo "Jiufeng Self-Defense Corps" to guard for the Japanese army. Before long, Zhao was arrested and imprisoned for bribery, and the pseudo "army" of seventy or eighty people all disintegrated and fled. The Japanese army also had no surplus power to send troops to station. The Chinese military authorities detected the situation and recently ordered Tian Huzi's troops of the guerrillas in the western suburbs of Qingpu to advance at full speed and have completely recovered the mountains. The thousands of stonemasons who had been unemployed for several months, led by the mountain owners, continued to return to the mountains to work. They were all overjoyed when they returned to their hometowns. As of now, the Japanese army has not dared to easily invade the guerrilla army that recovered the foot of Tianmashan.

### Tightening of Foreign Exchange Affects Various Industries in Shanghai; Coal Prices Rise Starting Yesterday; Sources Become Scarce; The Shipment of Foreign Rice to Shanghai Will Inevitably Increase Prices

Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the sharp shrinkage of the first currency, various industries in the city have increased the cost of goods purchased from abroad, and the cost of water has doubled. In order to maintain their capital, they have all increased prices since yesterday, or will hold meetings to increase prices. However, all citizens of the city are suffering from high living standards and are complaining incessantly. The details are as follows:

Coal Prices Rise

The coal market is affected by the tightening of foreign exchange, and the difference between buying and selling prices is relatively large. The cost of water is high, and the sale of coal once shipped to Shanghai is bound to suffer. The market is bullish and everyone is watching silently and temporarily does not leave the warehouse, so the spot goods are scarce. The Market Evaluation Committee held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided that the price of Indian lump coal is 43 yuan per ton, Kaiping coal is 41 yuan per ton, Hongji coal is 48 yuan per ton, Kaiping scraps are 36 yuan and 5 jiao for the first grade, and 28 yuan for the second grade. The above prices are all market transactions, as for coal

Hardware Meeting

The Shanghai Hardware Parts Industry Association, because the first currency has shrunk sharply, the sales price of hardware such as hinges and other parts ordered by the industry from Europe and the United States has increased. The Evaluation Committee of the company has set a meeting at the Tianjin Road Clubhouse at 1:00 pm today to increase prices and maintain capital. It is heard that important cases such as increasing the sales price of various hardware parts will be discussed at that time. The Hardware Industry Association is also scheduled to hold a meeting of all members at the clubhouse at 4:00 pm today.

Affects Foreign Rice

A reporter from New Sound News learned from a rice leader yesterday that, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the sales prices of domestic and foreign goods have been very different. Some rice merchants in the city, in order to plan ahead, have entrusted Dafu Foreign Bank to order 200,000 bags of Saigon foreign rice (2,000 tons). The price of each large bag is 19 yuan and 4 jiao. However, since the tightening of foreign exchange and the high cost of water, the price of foreign rice will inevitably increase at that time, which will affect the people's food. As for the second batch of foreign rice, the transaction has not yet been completed. Now, due to the foreign exchange relationship, the telegraph contact has been temporarily suspended.

### Public Works Department Brass Band

The Public Works Department Music Team is scheduled to hold a brass band concert at Zhaofeng Park from 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm on the 10th of this month (weather permitting). The program includes seven items.

### Japan Protests Hanging National Flags; The French Concession Authorities Have Replied; According to the Spokesman, the Content of the Reply is Very Ordinary

Regarding the issue of hanging national flags in the French Concession, the Japanese side protested to the French authorities and requested that the hanging be stopped. It is learned that the French Concession authorities have replied to the Japanese side's request. According to the spokesman on the 8th, the French authorities have indeed replied, but the content is very ordinary and does not include any special details.

### Hai Cheng Wheel Forced to Return to Hong Kong; The British Authorities Attach Great Importance; Blocked by Japanese Warships Outside Quanzhou for Four Days; A British Army Team Boards the Ship for Negotiations to No Avail; It is Heard that the British Ambassador to Japan Has Filed a Negotiation

Since the Japanese naval authorities hindered third-country ships from sailing in inland rivers, such as Xinghua, Quanzhou, Haidou, and Qidong, after nine ports, shipping companies from various countries have reported to the authorities that ships sailing on the Beisha Line (Qidong Haimen) have been forced to change the name of the closing port to continue to send ships. However, the Xinghua Quanzhou route, British Swire Company, had planned to send the Niuzhuang wheel to sail, but it was suspended due to Japanese obstruction and changed to Tianjin. A reporter from New Sound News learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the British Jardine Matheson Company's Hai Cheng wheel, with a gross tonnage of 2,080 tons and a net tonnage of 1,280 jiao tons, sailed from Hong Kong to Quanzhou with cargo and 56 passengers. On May 26, it was blocked by a Japanese warship outside Quanzhou, preventing the ship from entering Quanzhou to unload cargo. The shipowner telegraphed the British warship for assistance, and the British warship Da Meng (transliteration) sailed to protect it, and a small team of British navy was stationed on the Hai Cheng wheel, but repeated negotiations were ineffective. The Hai Cheng docked outside Quanzhou for four days and returned to Hong Kong. It is heard that the British authorities attach great importance to this matter, and the British government has ordered the British ambassador to Japan to file a negotiation with Japan on the case of Japan blocking China's inland rivers.

### Sources涌来; Prices Fall Back; Ordering Foreign Rice is No Longer Necessary; The Sharp Shrinkage of Foreign Exchange is Not Very Relevant

The other day, due to the sharp shrinkage of the exchange rate, it was said that foreign rice was difficult to continue to order and that hoarders took the opportunity to absorb it, and prices rose again. The shrinkage of the exchange rate made it very uneconomical to order foreign rice, so it is true that it will be difficult to continue to order foreign rice in the future. However, recently, there is sufficient rice in Shanghai, and the sources of production areas are very smooth. For example, yesterday, five or six boats arrived at Hexia, and trains and small boats transported more than 5,000 bags of rice to Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan and other places. Moreover, the weather is hot, and hoarders are deeply afraid that the stored rice will heat up and be damaged, so they are mostly out of the cage. The market transaction suddenly shows a situation of oversupply, so rice prices have turned down. Changshu white japonica rice has fallen back to 17 yuan and 3 jiao. Judging from the current situation of sufficient storage and arrival, it is not necessary to order foreign rice. Although foreign exchange is tight, it has no significant impact on rice prices. Shanghai citizens' food will never be in danger.

### Wang Jingwei to Cross to Japan: Chen Bijun, Gao Zongwu, and Japanese Nationals to Accompany Him; Will Form a Puppet "Central Government" with Japanese Merchants

Ever since Wang Jingwei was officially wanted by the National Government, his whereabouts have been exceptionally secretive, leading to conflicting rumors for months. However, according to reliable reports, Wang arrived in Shanghai in early June and has not left since, remaining for over a month. The information obtained is detailed below:

Wang's Residence

Upon arriving in Shanghai, Wang initially resided in Doihara's residence in Jiangwan, under special protection from the Japanese. Later, he moved back to his old residence on Avenue Haig in Shanghai. Wang's old residence, along with the mansions of Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Boqun, etc., are all within the extraterritorial road construction area. The residences of Sun, Wu, and Wang had long been occupied by the Japanese, but Wang's residence alone remained untouched, indicating a long-standing tacit understanding between Wang and the Japanese. The walls of his residence have been heightened for defense. Within a perimeter of thirty yards around the residence, pedestrians are not allowed to pass, and multiple wooden sentry posts have been established, guarded by rotating shifts of security personnel. Inside the perimeter, in addition to a squad of Japanese military police, there are also Wang's personal bodyguards, totaling 150 guards inside and outside. Each guard receives a salary ranging from thirty-five to one hundred and twenty yuan. Protection is extremely strict. Wang frequently travels between his residences in Jiangwan and western Shanghai. Each time he leaves, four cars are deployed in front and behind. Generally, when Wang is in contact with Japanese personnel and puppets from the northern and southern puppet organizations, he stays in Jiangwan. When he is in contact with his confidants and other parties, he stays in western Shanghai. Accompanying Wang to Shanghai are his wife, Chen Bijun, and Chen Bijun's nephew, Chen Chunpu. Chen was originally a commissioner and education director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission but was dismissed by the central government for siding with Wang. Chen's decision to come to Shanghai with Wang is certainly to carry out Chen Bijun's wishes, but his duty is specifically to handle intelligence, providing the Japanese with various important Chinese information. His reward from the Japanese is fifty thousand yuan per month.

Facilitating Figures

On the Japanese side, those facilitating Wang's collusion with the Japanese are Doihara and Harada Kageaki. Doihara and Wang became acquainted while living in Tokyo and have a deep friendship. On the puppet side, there are Chen Qun and Chen Zhongfu. Chen and others in the puppet group still claim to be members of the Kuomintang and have party ties with Wang. On Wang's side, there are Gao Zongwu and Zhou Fohai. In addition, the German side is also facilitating the connection between Wang and the Japanese. Wang's confidants, such as Chen Gongbo, were not absolutely sympathetic to Wang's actions, but Chen has always held pro-German views. Therefore, due to the instigation of the German side, they did not dissent. The rumor that Chen has broken away from Wang is just a smokescreen put out by Chen himself.

About to Cross to Japan

Wang has been in Shanghai for over a month, with Harada and others following him closely day and night. In addition to key Japanese figures, those who have met with Wang include Wang Kemin, Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, and Chen Qun. It is said that they are exchanging views on organizing a puppet "central government" and dividing the various puppet regimes in the north and south. The important issue is based on what Wen Zongyao and Chen Qun discussed when they crossed to Japan in mid-April. The Japanese had long planned to organize a puppet "Federal Central Government" from the northern and southern puppet governments, initially planning to have Wu Peifu or Wang Jingwei as the puppet leader. However, those on the Japanese side who favored Wu believed that Wu was a famous Chinese military figure and not a member of the Kuomintang, which could win over most of the military and civilians. At the same time, Wang's proposal to restore the organization of the National Government and continue to use the party-state flag of the Kuomintang was deemed inappropriate. As for those on the Japanese side who favored Wang, they mistakenly believed that Wang was a high-ranking official in the National Government and the Kuomintang and had considerable appeal. However, they advised Wang to slightly modify the use of the party-state flag. Since the Japanese supporters of Wu and Wang did not hold the same views, they summoned Wen and Chen to Japan in April to discuss the matter. Wen often told the Japanese that, based on his personal relationship with Wu, he could persuade Wu to take the stage, so Wen could be Wu's representative. Chen Qun was one of the people who facilitated the collusion between Wang and the Japanese. Before Wang arrived in Shanghai, Chen often conveyed the opinions of both Wang and the Japanese, so the Japanese implicitly recognized Chen as Wang's representative. After Wen and Chen returned to Nanjing in late April, Wang immediately arrived in Shanghai. Wang, Wen, Chen, and others repeatedly exchanged views, and Wang and Wen all hoped for the early establishment of a puppet "Federal Central Government." However, Wang believed that he still needed to personally contact the Japanese government, so he decided to cross to Japan in the coming days. Those accompanying him are Chen Bijun, Chen Chunpu, Gao Zongwu, and Japanese nationals such as Harada. The previous report that Wang returned to Shanghai from Japan on the 2nd of this month was inaccurate.

Future Puppet Government

The Japanese and Wang are eager to establish a puppet "central government" as soon as possible. It is said that the planned date of establishment is September 1st. It is rumored that the puppet "central government" will have Wu as the puppet president and Wang as the puppet premier. The administrative and legislative branches will be abolished. Liang Hongzhi may be the puppet speaker of the parliament. Wen Zongyao, Chen Jintao, Chen Qun, and others will serve as ministers of foreign affairs, finance, and internal affairs. The Japanese have significant intentions for organizing the puppet "central government." One is to use it as an organization to negotiate "peace" with the Japanese, so that Wang and others can sign treasonous treaties with the Japanese. Another is that the Japanese will use Wang and others to realize their conspiracy to control China with Chinese, dominating China's sovereignty and making China a vassal of Japan. Wang will cross to Japan in the coming days to discuss the steps to establish the puppet "central government." At the same time, there will be the recommendation of Zhu Ding, Matsui Haruo, and Hu Shouchang (Hu Jusheng), the chairman and vice-chairmen of the so-called "East Asia Anti-Communist League," to preside over the so-called peace talks to appease the Japanese dream of peace.

The Zhenhai Fortress of Ningbo was bombed by five Japanese aircraft at 1:00 PM on the 7th. The garrison forces returned fire and shot down one Japanese aircraft, which crashed into the sea outside Zhenhai. This news was first reported by a Da Guang News Agency reporter. Yesterday, the Japanese Fleet Press Department issued a communiqué admitting that one Japanese aircraft was shot down in Zhenhai.

According to the Communiqué:

"On the afternoon of the 7th, a detached unit of the Naval Air Force attacked Zhenhai.

### Prosperous Cargo Transportation at Haiphong; Jardine Matheson Sends Gonghe Ship to Haiphong as a Lighter; Freight Rates Increase by Nearly 50%

Since the fall of Guangzhou, Haiphong in French Indochina has become the main hub connecting the interior. Cargo transportation has suddenly become prosperous. However, besides the customs warehouses, there are no godowns prepared by merchants. Due to the lack of road vehicles, goods cannot be transported out in time, causing congestion in the warehouses. The customs has restricted the import of goods, so in the

Past Six Months

Both merchants and shipping companies have faced difficulties. Although the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies have sent the Yangtze River ships Wuchang and Pinghe to be stationed in Haiphong as lighters for storing goods, the ships are small and there are too many goods, which is of no help. It is reported that the customs in Haiphong has built additional warehouses, and the major work has been completed. Transportation companies have registered with the customs in advance to store goods transported on behalf of customers. The Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Weitai Bank, and various customs brokers in this city have

Registered Customs Warehouses

Jardine Matheson has recently sent the river ship Gonghe to Haiphong to be stationed there with Pinghe as a lighter. The ship left the port the day before yesterday (8th) morning and sailed directly to Haiphong via Hong Kong. A lot of goods were transported, over a thousand tons, mostly cotton yarn and piece goods. Freight rates have also increased repeatedly. Starting the day before yesterday (3rd), they increased by another 50%. However, merchants do not mind the high freight rates and only want to transport their goods as quickly as possible.

### Japanese Special Service Department Hired Detective Wang Ying Arrested and Executed

Wang Ying, a secret agent of the Japanese Army Special Service Department, was in his thirties and from Pudong. He used to be a coppersmith. After the National Army moved west, he joined the Japanese Army Special Service Department as an agent, specializing in spying on the whereabouts of Chinese guerrillas. Many Chinese guerrilla soldiers were killed because of his betrayal. From last month until now, he has colluded with the Japanese army and navy to identify guerrilla members and captains in various docks and towns in southern Pudong, and he has threatened and oppressed the villagers. The Headquarters of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army learned of this, and Chief of Staff Ji Tianchou designed a plan and personally kidnapped him from Shanghai to the headquarters. Commander He Xingjian and Commander Fan Gencai, Li Qimeng, and others decided to execute him by shooting. He was paraded for a week before being taken to the execution ground. The surrounding people were very happy.

### Husband Committed a Crime; Wife Quietly Left; Sues Husband for Abandonment and Requests Divorce; Husband Asks for Cohabitation; Two Cases Consolidated for Trial

Lu Wenruo from Hangzhou, 25 years old, lives at 410 Maitheson Road. His father, Lu Kuangjiu, used to practice law and owned property in Zhabei, but he has passed away. Lu Wenruo currently works in the hosiery department of the Sincere Company. His sister, Lu Langru, used to be a typist in Yu Xiangqin's law firm and is now a scorekeeper in the Huierdeng Apple Games Department on Yuyuan Road. On May 22, 1933, Lu Wenruo married Huang Xiuzhen (29 years old, currently residing at No. 1 Lianyi Lane, Avenue Joffre), daughter of Huang Ruiling, manager of the Kaiyuan Coal Mine, through a matchmaker.

Has Three Children

The eldest son, Yunfang, is now seven years old. The second son, Yunxin, is five years old. The youngest daughter, Jingyan, is only two years old. After the marriage, Lu got into trouble with the law due to bad friends and was imprisoned for over two years. After being released from prison, the couple reconciled and lived together. Recently, conflicts have frequently occurred between the couple, and their relationship has become irreconcilable. Huang Xiuzhen also left with her children recently and reported to the police that Lu Wenruo had abandoned her. She also filed a lawsuit against Lu in the Special District Court

For Divorce

Her reason is that Lu had been sentenced to imprisonment, was subjected to intolerable abuse, and published advertisements in the newspaper, causing serious insults to the plaintiff. According to Article 1052 of the Civil Code and the Supreme Court's precedents No. 530, 977, and 2533 of 1933, all meet the conditions for divorce. Therefore, she requests a judgment granting the divorce and reserves the right to claim damages. Lu Wenruo also hired Chen Maoxuan as his lawyer to sue Huang Xiuzhen

For Cohabitation

And return of children. His reason is that married couples have an obligation to cohabitate. Lu Wenruo published a notice in the newspaper after his wife left, hoping she would realize her mistake. However, Huang falsely reported abandonment to the police and took away two sons and one daughter to threaten him. Therefore, he had no choice but to file this case. The two cases were separately summoned by Judge Gui Yu and Judge Peng Shi. Judge Gui first opened the court to hear Huang Xiuzhen's divorce case against Lu Wenruo. Judge Gui advised Huang

To Consider the Three Children

Not to insist on her own opinions and to seek a proper solution. If she cannot tolerate the family, the mother-in-law, and sisters-in-law, then consider living separately to avoid destroying eight years of marriage in an instant. She should find a way to restore the relationship and make the family as complete as before. He announced that the case would be postponed and advised both parties to try to reconcile outside the court. Then, Judge Peng heard Lu Wenruo's suit against Huang Xiuzhen for cohabitation and

Return of Children

First, the court asked both parties about the family situation and environment. Since Huang had filed for divorce in the same court, this case was part of the same incident and needed to be tried together. Therefore, he also announced that the case would be adjourned for a hearing after a summons.

### Subletter Makes Things Difficult for Tenant; Resists Arrest by Punching; Fined Forty Yuan

Lin Qun, a woman living at 55 Shantou Road, rented the side room downstairs to Jian Jian A-liu to open a brothel. Soon, A-liu subleased the house to Yijun Brothel. However, A-liu owed 87 yuan in rent and left without paying, causing the sublessor Lin Qun to repeatedly make things difficult for Yijun (Li surname). Lin Qun's younger cousin, Que Wenlong, was young and energetic and helped his cousin cause trouble. In addition to privately removing eight bottles of beer and ten bottles of soda from Yijun's room and cutting the telephone line, he forcibly removed Yijun's furniture on the 30th of last month. Li Yijun immediately reported to the Laoza Police Station, which sent Chinese Detective Zhou Wenqing No. 106 and Western Detective Turner to investigate. Seeing Que Wenlong still in Yijun's room, they questioned him. However, Que not only did not answer but dared to resist arrest and punched Detective Zhou in the face. Western Detective Turner stepped forward to stop him and was also punched. As a result, Que was taken to the police station. Because the detective's injuries were not serious, he was not detained and was ordered to leave. He requested a warrant from the First Special District Court and summoned Que to the Fourth Criminal Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the circumstances and prosecuted according to the law. The Chinese and Western detectives also testified about the situation of being beaten. When questioned, the defendant confessed and did not admit to resisting arrest. Judge Meng sentenced Que Wenlong to a fine of 40 yuan for injuring someone's body in court.

As a result, the construction site and the two neighboring dyeing factories and cloth factories, as well as a primary school, were completely burned down, causing huge losses.

They hired attorneys Allman, Davis, and Kirk Paul to represent them. Attorney Davis filed a lawsuit with the United States Court for China on behalf of the plaintiff. The defendant hired attorney Fan Kelin to respond. The case has now been concluded, and the United States Court for China ruled in favor of the plaintiff, recognizing that the Eddie-Kola (爱的可乐) trademark of Yili Soda Factory is easily confused with the Coca-Cola (可口可乐) trademark of the plaintiff.

### Husband Abandons Wife and Children: Injury Part of the Case Concluded and Awaiting Judgment; Abandonment Part Scheduled for Further Review

Xu Jinchang, from Wuxi, is 38 years old and works at the Chinese Merchants Cloth Exchange, earning an annual income of over 4,000 yuan. He has been living with Wang Linxian (32 years old this year) for over ten years and has four children. They currently reside at 12 Liyuan Lane, Route Conty, in the French Concession. Their relationship was initially strong, but has gradually cooled in recent years. On the 8th day of this year, the couple argued over

a trivial matter,

resulting in Wang Linxian being beaten and injured by Xu. She immediately appointed lawyer Yu Xiufang to represent her, and filed a petition with the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court requesting a medical examination. She also filed a petition with the Criminal Division of the same court, accusing Xu Jinchang of assault. After the court received the petitions, it opened a hearing and summoned the defendant, who avoided appearing in court on the grounds that he was going to Wuxi. The court then issued an arrest warrant and brought him into custody. From then on, Xu

practiced abandonment

of Wang Linxian and their children, disregarding their livelihood. Later, Wang Linxian encountered Xu in the International Settlement, turned him over to the police, and requested the Second Special District Court to send police officers to bring Xu to court. He was ordered to be released on bail pending trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Liquan opened a continued hearing. The plaintiff, Wang Linxian, accompanied by her lawyer, appeared in court and stated, "On the 8th day of the month, I asked the defendant for daily living expenses, but not only did he refuse, but he also committed violence and

injured me."

The defendant testified that "On the 8th day of the month, the plaintiff was wearing red nail polish and wanted to go out. I criticized her for being extravagant, as we are not a wealthy family, and she should not dress like that. She did not listen, so I scolded her. She refused to obey, so I slapped her cheek once." After reviewing the testimonies, the court found the facts of the case to be clear and ordered the closing of arguments, announcing that the judgment would be delivered on the 13th, and then adjourned. Because Xu

abandoned his children

and disregarded their needs, Wang Linxian, in her capacity as legal guardian, filed a complaint with the French police. Because the police had not been able to locate Xu, they were waiting outside the court yesterday when they learned that Xu was attending the court hearing. They immediately dispatched plainclothes detectives to arrest Xu as he left the court and took him to the police station to await further investigation.

Marty's New Showroom Pre-Announcement The American Marty Motor Company, in addition to its showroom at 10 Avenue Edward VII, also has two other locations on Route Ghisi and Avenue Haig: one for the repair department and one for the body assembly station. Due to the expansion of business, the above three locations are no longer sufficient. Recently, the company invested 100,000 yuan to purchase the former Hacking Company's showroom and repair department at 640 Avenue Foch, which occupies an area of more than three mu. According to Mr. Marty, the general manager of the company, the new showroom will be used exclusively to display Packard and Vauxhall automobiles. The new repair department is currently sending people directly to foreign countries to order the latest repair machinery in the hope of becoming the newest automobile repair shop in Shanghai. As for Chrysler and Dodge automobiles, they are still displayed in the showroom on Avenue Edward VII. The repair department on Route Ghisi remains as it is. However, the procurement of new repair machinery and the decoration of the showroom will take a considerable amount of time, so it will not be completed until early September at the earliest. It is expected that the opening of the new showroom and repair department will make a significant contribution to the automotive industry at that time.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of Mr. Feng Shirong, who claims that he read a news item in the Shen Bao on the 8th of this month entitled "Feng Baorong Forges Will and Seizes Niece-in-Law's Huge Property." The contents of the news item do not correspond to the facts. My client acted in accordance with the will of Ms. Feng Jin and a unanimous resolution of her relatives' meeting to designate Feng Gengsheng and Feng Gengfa, the adopted grandsons of Ms. Feng Jin, to be the custodians of her estate. However, Ms. Feng Wang has long severed relations with Ms. Feng Jin and has now come forward in her capacity as legal guardian to claim guardianship rights. After repeated investigations by the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, the case was about to be concluded when the witness Feng Guifen suddenly claimed that her previous testimony was false. The Civil Division transferred the case to the Procuratorate for investigation and summoned my client and his son Shanliang to court for questioning on the 7th of this month. Feng Guifen did not appear in court at the time and sent a letter to my client stating that her confession was induced by the other party's enticement and coercion and that she felt uneasy in her conscience. The letter was presented to the court for review. At the same time, Shanliang testified that Feng Guifen had asked him to write a note for her to keep as a memorandum, but it was not his intention, and that everything written on the note was true and there was no fabrication. The report published by your newspaper concerning my client and others is inaccurate and affects my client's reputation. Please correct it in your newspaper. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Chen Tingrui, June 9th.

To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my clients, Li Yansun, Li Yongsun, Li Runshan, and Li Jimin, who claim that they read a news item in the Shen Bao on the 7th entitled "Wan Chen Sauce Garden Management" and "Shareholders Control, Shareholders Encroach" concerning their lawsuit against Zhang Qiuhua and others for encroaching on profits. The details of the article regarding my clients' allegations of encroachment by Zhang Qiuhua and others on the benefits are not fully in accordance with the facts. Li Runshan is the manager of this garden, while Zhang Qiuhua is only the director of the Min Ti Ni Yin Road branch garden, and is not the manager of this garden. We are afraid of misunderstandings from the outside world. In addition to publishing a statement in the newspaper, we will entrust another letter for correction. Accordingly, we urgently address to you, hoping that you will grant a correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Wu Huatai, June 9th.

To the Editor: In the case of abuse of a maid reported in your newspaper on June 8, there was a person named Wu Huikang who falsely claimed to live at No. 5, Lane 607, Beijing Road. This address is the exclusive residence of our distribution office and has not been sublet, nor is there such a person. We hereby write to you specially for correction. Please post it in the letters to the editor section to avoid misunderstanding and to correct the record. With respect, The Shen Bao, The Third One New Silk Factory Distribution Office, June 9th.

In addition, there were many factories that started construction successively in newly built or existing factory buildings, most of which were small-scale. Most of the factories were located in the areas outside the Shanghai Western District, and there were a total of 50 small factories located in the Eastern District, including a cigarette factory located in the Eastern District, which employs 400 workers and will be able to start construction soon.

Steam Pressure Machinery

There were a total of 86 boilers under the supervision of experts. Factories are increasingly complying with the rules set by the Public Works Department to apply for registration and submit inspection certificates, which is satisfactory. Several factories manufacturing boilers have applied for registration with the Industrial Section, but some have not been able to comply with the rules.

Accidents

A total of 223 industrial and occupational accidents were reported, including 7 fatalities, 1 female worker fatality, and 16 injuries. The causes of the accidents were definitely known in 194 cases, and detailed investigations were conducted, with factory owners being instructed to pay attention in 51 cases. The above-mentioned accidents occurred in 39 cases in the machinery and hardware industry, 37 cases in the transportation industry (including 1 fatality), 36 cases in the spinning industry (including 3 fatalities), 18 cases in the construction industry (including 1 fatality), and 11 cases in the printing industry (including 1 fatality).

Factory Owner Meetings

Factory owner meetings were held three times last month. One meeting was for factory owners in the straw mat industry, one was for factory owners whose factories had accidents due to electricity this year, and one was for factory owners manufacturing flashlight bulbs. The purpose of each meeting was to make factory owners pay attention to safety issues, formulate work plans, and jointly submit guarantees.

Job Placement

The Industrial Section, at the request of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, made efforts to introduce jobs to refugees in the shelters. Several female workers have been selected and sent to work in textile factories.

Labor Disputes

At the end of last month, a cigarette factory temporarily suspended operations in preparation for relocation. The workers demanded that living expenses be paid during the suspension period, but the factory did not accept this. The matter had not been resolved at the time of reporting.

Cost of Living

Since May, the Industrial Section has revised the base number for calculating the workers' cost of living index to the cost of living in 1936. In the past six months, the total cost of living index for workers in this city has increased by 17.43. The total index for May was 164.87, breaking the highest record since the outbreak of the war. Compared with the index in 1936, it has increased by 64.87%, and its reciprocal is 60.65. In other words, one yuan in national currency in 1936 is now worth only 6 jiao and 1 fen. The sub-indices for each category have increased from 0.33% to 9.97%, except for the fuel category, which has slightly decreased. Food prices have risen significantly, especially for rice and pork.

### Sino-Western Games: Today's Finals at the American School for Boys; Western YMCA Possesses Strong Strength and is Expected to Retain the Championship; Chinese Athletic Federation and Lido Will Contend with Meilin for Second Place

The open track and field games organized by the Shanghai International Amateur Athletic Federation will continue at the American School for Boys on Route Petain today, starting at 2 PM. There are seven track events and four field events, all of which are finals. After last Saturday's competition, the Western YMCA leads the pack with 25 points, followed by Meilin with 18 points in second place, with the Chinese Athletic Federation, Lido, and the Russian Army closely behind. Considering the strength of each team, the Western YMCA is likely to retain the championship. If Meilin's Finke doesn't encounter any unexpected incidents, he will pose a threat to the Western YMCA. Our Chinese Athletic Federation and Lido have abundant talent and have hopes of competing for the runner-up position. In addition, the five teams of School Federation and the Russian Army are more remarkable; the others are average. After the competition, the awards ceremony will be hosted by President Bratt. Tickets are still sold for 60 cents and $1.10.

Today's Schedule

(1) 100-Yard Finals 2:00 PM

(2) Pole Vault 2:00 PM

(3) 440-Yard Finals 2:10 PM

(4) Discus 2:10 PM

(5) High Hurdles Finals 2:25 PM

(6) Two Miles 2:40 PM

(7) Triple Jump 2:50 PM

(8) 220-Yard Finals 3:00 PM

(9) 880 Yards 3:20 PM

(10) High Jump 3:20 PM

(11) 880-Yard Relay 4:20 PM

Finals Outlook

In the short distance, School Federation's F. Edwards is absent due to illness. His brother, C. Edwards, will compete with Western YMCA's Fonseca, Lido's Chen Yongfu, Liu Yongsen, and Peide's Kurzmann. In the middle distance, Meilin's Finke hopes to sweep the top spots in both the 440-yard and 880-yard events. In the two-mile event, Lido's Wang Zhenglin is alone at the top, but Chinese Athletic Federation's Liu Guangfa, Meilin's Finke, Peide's Pike, and two French Army athletes' strength should not be underestimated. In the high hurdles, Chinese Athletic Federation's Li Zhenzhong should have no problem securing first place, as his strong opponent, Que Bo, has left. In the high jump, Chinese Athletic Federation's Wu Bixian and Lido's Xu Wenkui have a good chance. In the triple jump, Chinese Athletic Federation's Zhang Jiakui and Western YMCA's Fonseca have the highest hopes. The defending champions in the discus and pole vault, Meilin's Koffman and Russian Army's Abramov, are both still participating, making it difficult for the Chinese athletes to compete. In the 880-yard relay, the School Federation has a strong momentum, and the Western YMCA will be at a disadvantage.

### Overview of Vocational Education in China: Actively Training Vocational Education Teachers and Conducting Exhibitions for Mutual Learning

Teacher Qualification Review

Since the promulgation of the "Standards for the Establishment and Financial Allocation of Secondary Schools," the abnormal development of secondary education in various regions has gradually been corrected. Vocational schools have been increasing in number, creating an urgent need for excellent vocational teachers. In October 1933, the Ministry of Education promulgated the "Outline of Measures for the Registration, Qualification Assessment, and Training of Vocational Subject Teachers in Vocational Schools in Provinces and Cities." The registration method is divided into two types: first, those who have graduated from Class A industrial schools or agricultural, industrial, or commercial departments of senior high schools, or who have at least two years of experience, or who are mid-level technicians in the vocational industry and have continued to work for more than four years, may request registration to serve as vocational subject teachers in junior vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools; second, those who have graduated from domestic or foreign colleges or above and have at least two years of vocational experience, or who are senior technicians in the vocational industry and have continued to work for more than four years, may request registration to serve as vocational subject teachers in senior vocational schools. If provinces and cities lack the aforementioned registered teachers, but there are skilled craftsmen who are willing to serve as vocational technology subject teachers in senior or junior vocational schools, their technical types and levels should be assessed separately. If provinces and cities lack the aforementioned personnel, they should entrust colleges or above with achievements to train them separately. The training methods are as follows: senior vocational school teachers should recruit graduates from senior high schools with equivalent qualifications and provide them with three to four years of training, or recruit graduates from senior vocational schools with equivalent qualifications and provide them with three years of training for continued research in their original disciplines; junior vocational school teachers should recruit graduates from junior high schools with equivalent qualifications and provide them with three years of training, or recruit graduates from junior vocational schools with equivalent qualifications and provide them with one to two years of training for continued research in their original disciplines. The subjects to be trained have also been stipulated separately.

In 1937, the "Measures for the Registration of Technical Personnel in Provinces and Cities" were formulated and promulgated for implementation.

In the summers of 1936, 1937, and 1938, the Ministry of Education held training sessions for agricultural and industrial vocational schools and junior high school labor teachers. The agricultural training sessions were organized by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with Central University and Jinling University and the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute. The industrial training sessions were ordered by the Ministry of Education to be organized by the Shanghai Lester Technical College and Tongji University. These sessions will continue to be held in the future to provide further training for vocational teachers and labor teachers in various subjects.

### Jiang Jixin, Member of the Textbook Review Committee, Discusses the Shortcomings of Secondary School History Textbooks: Common Shortcomings in the Areas of Ethnicity and Culture

(Chongqing News) Jiang Jixin, a member of the Secondary School Textbook Editing and Textbook Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, recently reviewed the secondary school history textbooks published by major bookstores and extracted many of their shortcomings. The main points are summarized as follows:

Detailed Review of Five Types; Brief Review of Four Types

The secondary school history textbooks reviewed this time include Lu Simian's "High School History of China" (Commercial Press), Jie Xinren's "Junior High School History of Foreign Countries" (World), Chen Zuyuan's "Junior High School History of Foreign Countries" (Zhengzhong), Yu Xun's "High School History of China" (World), and Li Jigu's "Junior High School History of Foreign Countries" (World), etc. Jin Zhaozhi's "High School History of China" (Chung Hwa Book Company), Geng Danru and Wang Zongwu's co-edited "High School History of Foreign Countries" (Zhengzhong), He Bingsong's "High School History of Foreign Countries" (Commercial Press), and Li Qingsong and Jiang Gongsheng's co-edited "Junior High School History of China" (Datong) were also briefly reviewed. In general, high school history textbooks are slightly better than junior high school textbooks. As for the shortcomings found in the books, there are several points as follows:

Origin of the Nation; Erroneous Theories Not Eliminated

Regarding the origin of the Chinese nation, most history textbooks rely on already discovered underground materials to strongly argue that the Chinese nation has lived in this magnificent land of China since ancient times and did not migrate from elsewhere. They clearly recognize the erroneous theories such as the "Eastern Theory" or "Western Theory" that were first advocated by foreigners. This is a major progress in history textbooks in recent years. However, there are still history textbooks that remain vague about the origin of the Chinese nation, saying either "opinions vary" or "there is no consensus, so doubts remain" (Lu Simian and Yu Xun both do this), or openly advocate the "Western Theory" (Zhao Xinren's "Junior High School History of Foreign Countries," Volume 1, page 67, has this argument). This type of statement not only prevents Chinese people from understanding the source of their ancestors but also indirectly shakes the determination of the people to "defend the territory and love the motherland." This is one of the first shortcomings I felt when reading secondary school history textbooks.

National Boundaries; Too Strictly Divided

Furthermore, many editors of history textbooks still cannot escape the narrow old concepts, dividing the boundaries of the various ethnic groups too strictly, and obviously not proactively following the trajectory of the Chinese nation's evolution, which is contrary to the aims of the Three People's Principles' nationalism. For example, the historical facts of the mixing or assimilation of various ethnic groups in terms of language, bloodlines, clothing, and living habits are good materials for promoting the unity and integration of various ethnic groups, and should be fully developed to make the people understand that the mutual integration of the various ethnic groups has not been a matter of one day or one night. However, in some textbooks, the adoption of Hu clothing and Hu language by the Han people, or the adoption of Han surnames and customs by the Hu people, are often criticized. Regarding this point, Lu Simian's "High School History of China" is the most serious. In Lu's book, he often uses terms such as "foreigners" and "ethnic minorities" to refer to the various ethnic groups in the borderlands, in contrast to "China," deliberately strictly dividing the boundaries of the various domestic ethnic groups, almost denying that the ethnic minorities in the borderlands are Chinese. In addition, in some textbooks, the word "Chinese" is often replaced by the words "Han people" or "Han ethnicity" where it should be used, which is completely like the writing style of foreigners. Especially the words "Han ethnicity" are clearly one of the strange terms deliberately used by the Japanese to "divide the Chinese," but some textbooks blindly adopt it, which is puzzling.

Ancient Culture; Description Brief

In the History of China, the description of "ancient culture" is extremely important, because promoting the achievements of our ancestors in culture can enhance the national consciousness of the present people and stimulate the patriotic spirit of the present people. Therefore, some countries that have only recently evolved and have no ancient culture to speak of do not hesitate to fabricate history and falsely claim that their ancestors had achievements in culture in order to inspire their people. However, the several high school history textbooks I have seen have extremely brief and unsystematic descriptions of our country's ancient culture. They often fail to mention the inventions and creations in areas such as calendars, music, medicine, etc., and "the fact that the philosophical thoughts of the various schools of thought in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods are described in great detail, while the development of crafts and medicine at that time is not mentioned at all" is a common problem in all the books.

External Influence; Even Less Emphasized

Secondly, the status of Chinese culture in the world and its influence on other countries should be clearly stated in both Chinese and foreign history textbooks to prove that our country's culture has unparalleled value, which is beyond the reach of some self-proclaimed first-class powers. For example, the institutions, languages, writing, academic, skills, surnames, clothing, and living habits of Japan and other ethnic groups in East Asia are mostly imitations of our country, but in all history textbooks, the description of the influence of our culture on foreign countries only briefly mentions the westward transmission of the three major inventions (five major inventions) and the fact that the Uighurs came to China to study during the Sui and Tang dynasties. As for the status of our academic thought in the historical evolution of other countries and how much Japan's Meiji Restoration benefited from our country, they are not mentioned at all. Needless to say, everything else is not in the minds of those textbook editors.

### Concerned About Schools: The Problem of Student Congestion; More Than a Dozen Schools Still Unresolved

Since the retreat of the National Army from the Shanghai Concession area, the situation has remained relatively safe. As a result, many people from the war zones in the interior have fled to Shanghai, and a considerable number of them are students from elementary, middle, and high schools. Due to the increase in students, the number of newly established schools at all levels has increased like mushrooms after rain, but because of expensive rents, the school buildings are mostly narrow, so they have all exceeded their original quotas, resulting in an intractable problem of congestion. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Education Department, concerned about the congestion of students in its affiliated schools, which hinders both academics and hygiene, has sent letters to the schools instructing them to find spacious school buildings to relocate and start classes as soon as possible if their school buildings are insufficient. According to inquiries from the Education Department, only a dozen schools have found spacious houses to relocate to date, while more than a dozen schools have found the problem of congestion difficult to resolve due to the difficulty of finding empty houses. However, the Education Department is still urging them to comply quickly to emphasize academics, they say.

Traffic and Transportation Weekly

### Shanghai to Singapore

— Source

Singapore is located on a small island at the southern tip of the British Malayan Peninsula, connected to the mainland by a causeway. Due to its strategic position on the Europe-Asia sea route and the active management by the British, it has become an important commercial center, with prosperous trade, surpassing other places in Southeast Asia. Tin is the main export, followed by rice, rubber, spices, etc. The total population of the city is over 500,000, of which Chinese account for 70-80%. In recent years, the number of Chinese going to the city for trade has been increasing. However, for those who are going there for the first time, they may not be very clear about all the travel matters. Therefore, a brief introduction is given on the procedures to be completed before departure, the liners sailing between Shanghai and Singapore, and the prices of each class, for the reference and selection of those who are going there for the first time.

Applying for a Passport Before departure, you must first apply for a passport to go abroad. The procedure is to fill out an application form (the guarantor section of the application form must be stamped by the shop and its manager.) and prepare five 3-inch photos and apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The passport fee is twelve yuan. You can also entrust the China Travel Service to handle it, but it will take three weeks.

British Consulate Signature After obtaining the passport, go to the British Consulate to fill out two application forms and submit the supporting documents sent from the destination. Then the consulate will send the application form to the local government for investigation. After the local government investigates, it will report the facts to the local consulate. If it is considered qualified, the passport will be issued. The signature fee is ten shillings and six pence in British gold.

Doctor's Certificate Before purchasing a ticket, you must go to the doctor for smallpox vaccination and inoculation, and obtain a certificate from the doctor. Otherwise, the shipping company will not allow you to purchase a ticket and board the ship. (If you are traveling in the third or fourth class, the doctor's certificate must be issued by the Public Works Bureau to be valid.)

After the passport signature and doctor's certificate are completed, you can choose to purchase a ticket. There are ships from Shanghai to Singapore from Italian Post, French Post, British, North German, Blue Funnel and other companies. The ships and ticket prices of each company are listed below:

(A) Italian Postal Ship Company has the "Conte Verde", "Conte Rosso", "Conte Biancamano", and "Victoria" ships. Ticket prices: First class British gold 20 pounds, second class 14 pounds, economy second class 10 pounds. The journey takes seven days.

(B) French Postal Ship Company has "Aramis", "Athos II", "Marshal Joffre", "President Doumer", "Chantraboon", "Chenla Bao", "Felix Roussel" and other ships. Ticket prices: First class British gold 20 pounds, second class 15 pounds, third class 9 pounds. The journey takes ten days.

(C) British Company has "Cathay", "Dundela", "Ranchi", "Rawalpindi", "Canton", "Kaffir", "Chitral", "Rajputana" and other ships. Ticket prices: First class British gold 20 pounds, second class 14 pounds (no third class).

(D) North German Company has "Scharnhorst", "Gneisenau", "Bochum" ships. Ticket prices are the same as the British company.

(E) Blue Funnel Company has "Hector", "Antenor", "Patroclus", "Sarpedon" ships. Ticket prices: First class British gold 18 pounds (no second or third class).

### National Railways Implement Fare Increase

— Bao Cheng

Since the incident, although most of the national railways have been unable to continue operating due to environmental reasons, the transportation authorities have still tried their best to exert their functions and work hard on transportation. In addition to the original national railways that continue to operate within the possible scope, new routes have also been added to facilitate transportation. For example, the recently opened Hunan-Guangxi and Hunan-Guizhou railways were both opened after the war. According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Transportation has now stipulated that from May 11th of this year, the passenger fares of all national railways will be increased, and a three-month trial will be conducted, stipulating the following measures:

(1) All passenger tickets will be calculated at a 25% increase from this date.

(2) All calculated remainders will still be calculated according to the previous method of calculating as five cents if it is less than five cents, and as one dime if it is more than five cents but less than one dime.

(3) Parcel, sleeper tickets, platform tickets, and express train surcharges will be handled as before.

(4) When selling special express tickets, the express train ticket should be removed first, increased by 25%, and then the express train fee should be added separately.

(5) Children's tickets, group tickets, round-trip tickets, and military half-price tickets will all be discounted based on the increased ticket price.

(6) Supplementary penalty fares should also be penalized by half based on the increased ticket price.

(7) A stamp of "Increased price by 25% by order" should be affixed on the current passenger tickets. Before the Accounting Office of the Railway Bureau produces and issues this stamp, the above words can be noted in red ink.

According to the national railway passenger tickets, this decision to increase by as much as a quarter is undoubtedly too much. However, during this time of national crisis, it seems that the various sectors will not feel any dissatisfaction with such a small increase in expenses.

### Air Transport

— Star

The Eurasian Aviation Company's southwest airlines, namely, Chongqing-Hong Kong, Chongqing-Yunnan River, and Rong-Yu (Chengdu-Chongqing) lines, had been suspended for a period of time due to the shortage of aircraft. Now they have gradually resumed, but with fewer flights.

The Chongqing-Hong Kong line's Yu-Gui (Chongqing-Guilin) section is scheduled to go south on Wednesdays and Fridays, and north on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The Gui-Hong (Guilin-Hong Kong) section is still scheduled as irregular night flights. Therefore, the company flies directly between Chongqing and Hong Kong more than three times a week, and the flight dates are still irregular. The Chongqing-Yunnan is south on Mondays and north on Fridays. The Dien-He (Yunnan-Hanoi, Vietnam) line is a round trip on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The Rong-Dien line is a round trip on Thursdays. As for the company's northwest lines, they are now in a completely suspended state. The ticket prices are still the same as before. There are no changes in the routes and ticket prices of China National Aviation Corporation.

### Entering Guangxi Itinerary

— Que Chang

Before Guangzhou was abandoned, anyone going to Guangxi from Shanghai could first take a ship to Hong Kong, then take an electric boat from Hong Kong to Wuzhou; after arriving in Wuzhou, take a public bus via Guixian to Liuzhou, and then go to Guilin or other places from Liuzhou, which was very convenient. Such a journey only took four days (referring to starting from Hong Kong; the Shanghai-Hong Kong section depends on what ship you are taking.) and the travel expenses were only thirty or forty yuan. However, since Guangzhou was abandoned, this road is impassable, and it is more difficult to go to Guangxi again. There was a time when you could land in Guangzhou Bay and go to Guangxi, but since Hainan Island was occupied, this road has also been affected. However, our transportation authorities have not been affected by the war in their mission to develop southwest transportation. The war continues to evolve, and roads and other transportation are still progressing. Although the route is relatively longer, the time will inevitably increase, but in any case, we will not be hindered. Our shortcut to Guangxi is an example;

Under today's circumstances, if you want to go to Guangxi from Shanghai, the first step is always to go to French Haiphong. There are direct ships between Shanghai and Haiphong. Large cabins are divided into two types: 225 yuan and 215 yuan, second-class large cabins are 190 yuan, officer cabins are 90 yuan, room cabins are 66 yuan, and hanging berths are 44 yuan. (Although going directly to Haiphong is more economical than transferring through Hong Kong, it takes about ten days. If you don't want to delay too much, it is still better to transfer through Hong Kong.) Before going to Haiphong, you should first apply to the government for a transit passport through Vietnam. Each passport should pay a fee of 8 yuan in national currency, submit five recent photos, and find a suitable guarantor. China Travel Service can handle the application procedures, which takes four weeks. If you transfer through Hong Kong, you can apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Visa Office on the 5th floor of the Banque de l'Indochine in Hong Kong. You need to submit three 4.5-inch half-length photos, fill out two forms for visa matters, have them guaranteed by a solid store or manager in Hong Kong, and submit them to the office in person along with a passport fee of 2 yuan and a stamp tax of 4 yuan. Collect the receipt, and you can pick up the visa based on the receipt in four or five days. (To be continued in the next issue)

### After Continuous Fluctuations in Finance, Foreign Exchange Has Been Slightly Stabilized, Importers Plan to Apply for the Issuance of New Exchange Rates, Hong Kong Side Has Supply According to Current Exchange Rates, The Date of Determination Should Not Be Far Away

The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC announced the listing, only the Dutch exchange rate returned to 125, the rest were the same as the third listing on the previous day. The dark market situation of British and American exchange rates has been slightly stabilized compared to before. Initially, due to the frequent settlement of foreign firms and the secret efforts of Chinese merchants, the potential became tight. Later, it was heard that HSBC Bank will maintain the listed price (British gold 6.5 shillings, American exchange rate 12.625 yuan). It was also rumored that various import firms felt that the sharp contraction of the dark market exchange rate had greatly affected their business prospects, so they gathered to discuss and seek remedial measures. It was also said that they decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting the issuance of a new exchange rate specifically for foreign firms, so that they would not be subjected to unexpected losses due to speculation and manipulation by certain parties and Chinese and Western merchants. This move may soon become a reality, because China seems to have no intention of clarifying the Shanghai black market exchange rate, but only to do the same as last year when it fell to about 8 shillings, and then take 8 shillings as the exchange rate. If so, the listed price of about 6.5 shillings may be the level of the new exchange rate in the future. However, this is not a thorough solution after all, how can it prevent the past abuses? This depends on how the Chinese authorities take measures. As a result, the general intention of foreign firms to buy in yesterday suddenly faded, and the market suddenly loosened due to the competition between Hong Kong telegrams and foreign firms to supply. Later, the market situation became tight again due to the repeated buying in by Western merchant Sassoon. As a result, the British exchange rate continued to tighten by 1875, and the American exchange rate also weakened by 375. The trading was flat throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, it could still be settled at 45 yuan.

Hong Kong telegrams were once thrown out

At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was flat in the near and far term, the New York bank was fixed, the London raw gold was one shilling, the exchange rate of British against American was 7 cents small, against Shanghai it fell sharply by 1 shilling 4375, against France it did not change, American against British shrank by 1875, against Shanghai it fell sharply again by 1 yuan 40 cents, against France it fell by 0.0625, the central listing of each exchange rate was as before, the bank opened the spot selling price in the morning, the British exchange rate was 6.75 shillings and the American exchange rate was 13.125 yuan, compared with the previous closing, there was no glory. After opening, foreign firms and Chinese merchants competed to buy in, and the bank's intention to supply was not good, resulting in a tight situation. It is estimated that foreign firms settled the spot British gold for 6.625 shillings for entering the British Bank, and at the same time the American exchange rate also weakened to 12.875 yuan. When HSBC announced the listing at 9:30, only the Dutch exchange rate returned to 125, the rest remained at the original price and said that the bank's balance tax was announced, and there was no change, still levying 4.50%. At that time, it was suddenly heard that HSBC was willing to maintain the listed price, which caused a selling trend. As a result, Western merchant Sassoon, Chinese merchants and foreign firms competed to buy in. However, foreign firms suddenly had the intention to sell, and Hong Kong telegrams also came to supply, and the market situation suddenly rebounded and softened. It is estimated that Sassoon settled the spot British gold for 6.6875 shillings for entering Hong Kong telegrams, and Chinese merchants and foreign firms successively bought in the spot British gold of 6.6875 shillings from McCali and Anda. Soon foreign firms absorbed and purchased the spot American exchange rate of 13 yuan from a certain bank in Belgium. Near noon, foreign firms came to buy in again, and the potential became tight again. Extended to the afternoon closing, the bank's selling price of British gold tightened again to 6.625 shillings, and the American exchange rate also weakened to 12.875 yuan. Compared with the morning opening, the British exchange rate shrank by 125 and the American exchange rate weakened by 25. It is said that the Hong Kong exchange rate bank's intention to sell is still good, and the estimated selling price is 45 yuan.

Although Sassoon bought in, the impact was small

The afternoon trading was quite clear, and the market situation was still flat. First, Yooli absorbed and entered the same bank's July British gold for 6.5 shillings. Later, Western merchant Sassoon came to buy in again, and foreign firms also followed suit, but because Hong Kong telegrams also had a strong stomach to sell, it was not affected. It is estimated that Sassoon and foreign firms successively settled and entered the spot British gold of 6.625 shillings, and also the spot American exchange rate of 12.8125 and 875. After this, foreign firms still wanted to buy in, but Hong Kong telegrams had stopped throwing out, and foreign firms' intention to supply was weak, and the situation was slightly tight. The Hong Kong exchange rate, the foreign firms were quite willing to sell out at 45 yuan. Extended to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price, the British exchange rate was 6.5625 shillings, and the American exchange rate was 12.75 yuan. Compared with the previous day's evening closing, the British exchange rate tightened by 1875 and the American exchange rate also weakened by 375. The British and American exchange rates have shrunk for three consecutive days, the British exchange rate has totaled 1.6875 shillings, and the American exchange rate has totaled 3.34375 yuan. The trading record opened for a day is recorded below.

The Hong Kong Dollar Rose the Most Violently

Hong Kong, 9th telegram, the exchange rate market opened in the morning today, chaotic and uneasy, without any standards. At 10 am, the spot quotation for the British dollar was British gold 1 shilling 2.75 pence, shrinking 15625 compared to the previous day. The spot for the American dollar was American gold 28 yuan 7.5 cents, shrinking 375 cents compared to the previous day. There were no reports for forward and Shanghai exchange rates and Japanese exchange rates. At 10:45, it was continued to be reported that the Japanese exchange rate was Japanese gold 105.25 yuan, shrinking 1 yuan compared to the previous day. At 11:05, it was continued to be reported that the American exchange rate returned by 0625, and the British exchange rate also grew by 03125. The forward was 1 shilling 2.75 pence, the Japanese exchange rate was lengthened by 25, and the Shanghai exchange rate rose to 214 yuan in legal tender, growing by 27 yuan compared to the previous day.

The Tianjin Exchange Rate Continued to Tighten

Tianjin, 9th telegram, the exchange rate market continued to tighten at the opening today, the British exchange rate shrank by 6875, the American exchange rate shrank by 1 yuan and 3125, the Shanghai exchange rate grew by 2 yuan, the "professional notes" fell back by 2 yuan and 50 cents, and the market atmosphere was confused and uneasy.

### Decreasing Circulation of Chips, Unstable Gold Market, New High Reached at 2,470 Yuan, Intermediate Relaxation Still Suggests Easier to Rise Than Fall

Yesterday's cash settlement ("烚赤") gray market saw price fluctuations not as large as the previous day, but the situation was still quite volatile, generally showing a trend of first rising, then falling, and finally rising again. The shift depended purely on the tightness of foreign exchange and the buying and selling situation. Initially, a certain gold firm (acting for the Huainan gang) aggressively increased its positions, causing the morning opening to rise to 2,420 yuan. Then, suddenly, news came that HSBC's listed exchange rates for British and American currencies had not changed, and at the same time, the foreign exchange rate was reported to have relaxed. Panic selling immediately surged, dropping the price to 2,385 yuan. After that, the price fluctuated around 2,400 yuan for quite some time. In the afternoon, news came that the foreign exchange rate had tightened again, triggering a buying frenzy, especially from securities firms and a certain bank (acting for a foreign bank), who were aggressively collecting. The market price soared, reaching new highs one after another, even reaching an unprecedented record of 2,470 yuan. However, before the evening close, the process of soaring was easier. Over the past two days, speculators with huge funds in the city have been aggressively accumulating and are still adding to their positions. The circulation of chips is dwindling, and foreign banks continue to buy aggressively. Finally, due to the emergence of cautious profit-takers, there was a slight decline, but the result was still a sharp increase of 60 yuan. The price has risen for four consecutive days, totaling a significant 346 yuan. Trading was brisk, reaching around 5,000 taels. Silver ornaments also rose successively by 6 yuan, listing at 248 yuan, an unprecedented high since the market's inception. Customs gold remained flat, while Chinese and English pure gold unanimously reversed its decline and rose.

Cash Settlement Soars, Another Sharp Increase of 60 Yuan

Since this morning, each tael (ten liang), due to the large fluctuations in the previous two days, all members were already present at the exchange at 9:00 AM. Initially, a money exchange business ("錢兌業") first called to buy at 2,380 yuan, followed by its gold firm (acting for the Huainan gang), which also tracked the purchase, especially as the foreign exchange rate was reported to be tight at that time, and buyers became increasingly eager, frantically raising prices against each other. However, sellers, aware of this frantic situation, held on even tighter, and the price soared, calling up to 1,400 yuan beyond the customs, but still had difficulty finding a counterpart. It was delayed until 9:35 AM when the market opened, and a certain gold firm bought 50 taels from a money exchange business, with the price rising to 2,420 yuan, a massive 40 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous night. Suddenly, news came that HSBC's listed rates were announced, with British and American exchange rates unchanged, and it was also heard that it was still willing to maintain the listed price, the buying frenzy immediately subsided, and everyone stopped aggressively buying, and immediately moved to fall, momentarily falling 9 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 50 taels to a peer at 415 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange rate relaxed, buyers became even scarcer, and the decline sharply intensified. In an instant, it plunged into the 400 yuan range. A certain gold firm (acting for a wealthy individual coming to the market) aggressively sold over 200 taels to a securities firm and a certain gold firm, and the price fell back to 385 yuan. After that, a certain bank continued (acting for a foreign bank) to aggressively absorb at low prices, but because the money exchange business and the silversmith gang were still aggressively supplying, the market was quite flat, hovering between 390 yuan and 400 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, the bank bought 50 taels from the silversmith gang at 405 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm again acted for a wealthy individual coming to the market, and the silversmith gang also came to supply, gradually falling 20 yuan. The silversmith gang sold 50 taels to a money exchange business at 285 yuan. Around 11:30 AM, news came that the foreign exchange rate was tightening again, coupled with a certain bank aggressively buying for a foreign bank, the underlying trend was upward. Later, a certain bank bought 50 taels from the silversmith gang at 400 yuan as the noon closing price. It was heard that after the close, the bank continued to buy 200 taels, all at 405 yuan, supplied by the money exchange business and others. The afternoon opening was under the umbrella of a buying frenzy, and it was raised another 10 yuan, initially by a certain gold firm buying 50 taels from a peer at 430 yuan. Then, it leaped another 5 yuan, with the money exchange business mutually trading 50 taels at 435 yuan. Later, because a certain silversmith slightly sold, it fell back to 20 yuan. Around 3:00 PM, Defu Securities from the securities gang suddenly aggressively bought 300-400 taels, seeing that the foreign exchange closing rate was reported to be tight, sellers disappeared, and the price soared, even flying up 50 yuan. The securities gang reached a peak of 470 yuan, an unprecedented high. After 3:30 PM, those with abundant profits, those with abundant floating profits, all came to sell high cautiously, and then moved downwards, delaying until 4:00 PM when a money exchange business sold 50 taels to a silversmith gang, lowering the price to 2,440 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price rose sharply again by 60 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous night. It has risen for four consecutive days, totaling 346 yuan. The daily fluctuation was also large, totaling 85 yuan. The cash firms' own-brand gold settlement price ("烚赤") was about 10 yuan higher, while the current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were very few transactions.

Silversmith Jewelry Gold Suspends at 248 Yuan

The initial price for silversmith jewelry gold was still suspended at 242 yuan per tael. At 12:10 PM, it was increased by two yuan. Later, at 2:55 PM, due to the cash settlement reaching an unprecedented record, it also leaped by four yuan. After that, there were no changes. Datong Bank listed at 248 yuan, while Xintong Bank listed at 246 yuan, buying in at 240 yuan, all creating unprecedented high prices since the market's inception.

British Pound Weakens, Pure Gold Also Rises One Penny

An eight-day London dispatch stated that British pure gold rose by one penny per ounce due to the weakening of the British pound, totaling 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pennies. As a result, the Central Bank's cash purchase price for Chinese currency also rose to 1,211 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed Customs gold remained flat, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai Standard Gold price also rose by 7 jiao, reaching 1,206 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Discount Rate Returns Small Yuan Half

Interbank Offered Rate Rises Two Fen

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange-drawn bills suddenly saw a drop in the market. Initially, every ten yuan had fallen to as low as 51 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, but at noon it returned to 52 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. In the afternoon, suppliers increased again, and a drop was seen again. The final price was 50 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, a small return of one yuan and a half compared to the previous day. The money industry's interbank offered rate rose two fen, suspended at a high of one jiao and two fen, it is said.

### Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise, British and American Gold Pounds Rise Seven Yuan and Four Jiao, Japanese Notes Still Below Legal Tender

Yesterday, British pure gold rose half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell 1.875. Local foreign exchange banks were settling accounts very actively, and foreign banks' supply was not smooth, and the trend was already weak. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6.5 pennies, and the American exchange rate was 12.625. The cash settlement market opened, and prices continued to prosper, rising to 40 yuan. After entering the market, the situation was chaotic. Fluctuations were uncertain. The noon closing returned to stability, and the afternoon rising wind resumed strongly. Machine merchants were very interested and absorbed a lot, reaching a high peak of 2,470 yuan, continuing to break records. The evening closing slightly returned to 2,440 yuan, a further increase of 60 yuan compared to the previous day. After the closing, it was difficult to find a counterpart to buy at 2,460 yuan, and sellers were calling for 2,500 yuan. It can be seen that before the foreign exchange rate stabilizes, there are still high waves. The rising wind of foreign currencies is strong, and British and American gold pounds are rising together. Demand is very strong, but there are markets but no goods, and supply cannot be provided. British and American gold notes are absorbed very strongly, and supply is not smooth. Hong Kong notes and others are in great demand, and supply is scarce. Japanese gold notes are quite stable, with the evening market at 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 8 li. Korean notes are at 8 jiao and 4 fen. In reality, they have been greatly discounted, because foreign exchange and gold prices have been expensive by 20%, while Japanese notes are still below legal tender. It can be seen that the Japanese yen is not worth even 6.5 pennies. Transactions at the guild were quite prosperous. Hongchang sold, and Tongfeng bought Annam notes for 200 yuan. Huitong sold, and Tongfeng bought Annam notes for 100 yuan. Dingyuan sold, and Tongfeng bought Hong Kong notes for 100 yuan. Yongfeng sold, and Tongfeng bought Hong Kong notes for 300 yuan. Dingyuan sold, and Baoxiang bought American gold notes for 100 yuan, and also sold, and Zhenxing bought American gold notes for 100 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds each rise 2 yuan, British gold notes rise 2 yuan and 6 jiao, American gold notes rise 5 jiao and 2 fen, Hong Kong notes rise 1 jiao and 3 fen, French franc notes rise 1 fen and 2 li, Singapore notes rise 1 jiao, Dutch notes rise 1 jiao and 1 fen, Annam notes rise 7 fen, Robi notes rise 8 fen, Canadian notes rise 4 jiao, Philippine notes rise 1 jiao and 5 fen, Italian notes rise 5 li, Australian gold notes rise 2 yuan and 5 jiao. Only German gold notes and Siamese notes did not change.

### Securities, Foreign Debt Still Weak, Foreign Stocks' Prominence Has Passed, Domestic Debt Hovers Between Several Jiao

The securities gray market situation yesterday was still unable to rise, hovering between several jiao. The financial situation was volatile and unstable, while the debt market remained stable, as if it were unrelated to the environmental situation. It seemed that there were people controlling the market price from the middle. Several times it was raised, but still went downstream. Only Class E was the most firm due to the withdrawal relationship. The interest of large households has not waned until now. Starting today, Class E will be calculated without the middle. If large households raise it again, the market price will not be easily reduced. Yesterday's events: in the early morning, No. 20 Tongkang and others still raised prices. Class E reached 37 jiao, Class A reached 63 yuan, and Class B reached 5 yuan. Then the sellers surged, such as Tiansheng, Shunheng, No. 22, No. 8, and No. 16 were all selling. Although Tongshun, Runli, etc. all had purchases, the noon closing slightly returned. Only Class E was still 2 jiao and a half higher. In the afternoon, the trend was slightly softer. Class C broke the 3 yuan level again. Runli continued to buy. Tiansheng slightly compensated. No. 42 and No. 35 both had purchases. The sellers' momentum was thicker. Maoda, Datong, Suji, No. 13, and No. 52 were all selling. Retail investors also sold a lot. The market price continued to be small 3 jiao to 6 jiao, only Class E was only small 5 fen. The total number of transactions was approximately 700,000-800,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---|
Unified A | 62.00 | 62.20 | 62.30 | Down 0.35
Unified B | 55.00 | 54.25 | 54.30 | Down 0.60
Unified Internal | 53.45 | 52.75 | 52.75 | Down 0.45
Unified D | 52.80 | 52.20 | 52.25 | Down 0.50
Unified E | 53.70 | 53.15 | 53.20 | Down 0.05
96 | 6.30—— | 6.30 | Down 0.15

Stock trading: 50 shares of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange were traded, at a price of 39 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.

The demand for Rubber shares from the Public Industries Association was very active, while the trend of most industrial shares was even more uneven. English Zha Hua shares, Lang Gzhi shares, Rubber Trust shares, and Zha Hua Kang Sha shares were traded briskly, and prices rose. The strength of rubber stocks is not entirely due to the devaluation of legal tender, but it is really due to receiving good news from New York and Singapore, saying that the United States consumes a wide range of rubber, and also mentions that the manufacturers' plan to purchase goods cannot continue for long. For the rest, such as the International Trust stock price was 5 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen, the telephone stock price was 110 yuan, the Jardine stock was stable, at 11 yuan and 4 jiao, the Kaiping stock was slightly soft in the morning due to the impact of falling prices in London, but later it firmly rose, and the closing price was 37 yuan, and 5 and a half percent of electricity was publicly traded in huge quantities, at a price of 89 yuan. China Business Corporation's 8% public bond seemed firm, at a price of 74 yuan and a half.

The listed market prices of London-based English Far East companies' stocks on the 8th of this month (Thursday) were affected by the sharp contraction of the Shanghai-London exchange rate. HSBC bank shares each fell 1 pound, with the price of London registered shares at 85 pounds and the price of Hong Kong registered shares at 86 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine unregistered shares also fell by one shilling, with the price at 20 shillings and 6 pennies, and the rest were unchanged.

The listed market prices of London-based Chinese foreign debt on the 8th of this month (Thursday): The upper-end public bonds all fell endlessly, all creating new low prices. Crisp Bonds continued to fall 2 pounds, with the price at 30 pounds. Chinese-French US$500 public bonds with printed debt tickets also fell 1 pound, with the price at 59 pounds. English and German continuation and settlement funds of the British value tickets each fell half a pound, the former at 61 pounds and the latter at 43 pounds and a half. The lower-end railway public bonds were slightly stabilized. Only the Hubei-Guangdong Railway public bond continued to fall 1 pound, with the price of non-German-issued printed debt tickets at 19 pounds, and the price of German-English printed debt tickets at 18 pounds. The rest were unchanged.

### How Can a Beautiful Woman Be Satisfied with a Weak Husband?

The fairest thing in the world is half a catty matched with eight taels. If half a catty is matched with nine taels, then an unfair phenomenon will be manifested. If it is unfair, then it will cry out, which is a matter of course. How can a beautiful woman marry a husband who is unattractive and weak? But in fact, "A skilled woman often sleeps with a clumsy husband," which is truly the only regret in the world!

A beautiful woman should marry a handsome and promising husband. That is a perfect match, truly a match made in heaven. Their love after marriage will definitely be sweet and lingering. They will have sons and daughters, a happy family, and enjoy unlimited happiness in life! If she marries a weak and incompetent husband, even if she uses all her love and affection, he will still be indifferent and hypocritical because he is powerless to do anything. How can this not make her feel discouraged? However, time flies like an arrow, and as she watches her youth pass by, how can she not feel heartbroken? Therefore, the tragedies between couples, such as quarrels, separation, divorce, adultery, elopement, and suicidal thoughts, are endless!

In physiological research, the physique of a man should be stronger than that of a woman, and his abilities should also be more abundant. Why is he so weak and incompetent? According to medical judgments, this is mostly caused by men committing self-pollution and seminal emission in their early years, or early marriage and indulgence in sexual desires, and unrestrained licentiousness. Because our appearance development and healthy life are greatly related to reproductive function, if the gonadal fluid that controls reproductive function is exhausted, then the metabolism will be reduced, the development function will be stagnant, the nerves will be exhausted, and symptoms such as incomplete development, premature aging, premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia will follow. Such a man, no matter how strong his body was originally, will definitely fall rapidly. Not only will the couple's life not be happy, but he will also resent himself and shorten his natural life, suffering the tragedy of separation and death!

Why does the wise husband of the times have to put himself in such a desperate situation? Today is a world of medical prosperity, and the above-mentioned symptoms already have special treatments that can be remedied. What is the special treatment? It is based on the principle of endocrine in the gonads, collecting potent animals, such as orangutans, apes, sea dogs, tigers, wolves, bears, and deer, and extracting gonadotropin from their bodies, and then replicating it into a preparation using scientific methods. Therefore, since this preparation was invented by Austrian physiologist Dr. Steinach, it is called "Steinach's Gonadotropin." The medicine is divided into male and female uses. After men take male "Gonadotropin," they can produce sperm, invigorate the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, nourish nerves, promote development function, and regulate metabolism within 24 hours. Continuing to take it for three days, those with mild symptoms will recover, and those with severe symptoms will be relieved. After taking it for half a month, hundreds of diseases can suddenly disappear, and the body will become healthier. The famous German doctor Dr. Wansdling has compared this preparation with other preparations. As a result, the function of "Gonadotropin" is always more than five times that of other similar preparations, which shows the value and effectiveness of this preparation. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himitot's Sperm-Solidifying Tablets" to solidify the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that both the root and the branches can be treated, and the effect is even faster!

Beautification

### The Influence and Remedy of Shrunken Breasts

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

A beautiful woman in her prime,

Why are her breasts so shrunken?

Everyone laughs in social situations,

And feels lonely in her dreams!

There are many young women now who say they have beautiful faces, gentle personalities, and that their movements and thoughts are generous and agile, but they have a defect of shrunken breasts. They never take it to heart, and some, although they do take it to heart, always procrastinate and refuse to seek a remedy thoroughly, only seeking to cover up the shame temporarily, wearing some false masks, thinking that it is all over, but in fact, where is it so convenient? Try to look at a woman with shrunken breasts. No matter how beautiful and light cheongsam she wears, she only feels stupid and pitiful. Is there anything touching about her? Because the curvaceous beauty advocated by modern people completely requires towering breasts as the foundation. If the breasts are shrunken or as flat as a man's, then how can curves be formed? Therefore, even if she has first-class talent and beauty, she will be obscured and unmanifested because of this. If she has less talent and beauty, then not only will she be laughed at by everyone in social situations, but she will also suffer all kinds of contempt between husband and wife. As a result, her fate will be very tragic! The only remedy, according to world-renowned gynecologist Dr. Harvard Yuke Elvis and my experience, is universally recognized that taking the ovarian endocrine preparation female "Gonadotropin" is the most suitable and effective. The main reason for shrunken breasts is the dysfunction of the ovaries. If the ovarian secretion of potent animals is used to supplement the dysfunctional female body at this time, it will naturally show a great effect. Therefore, those who take this preparation for four weeks will have a more beautiful complexion, increased appetite, and the shrunken breasts will also gradually swell. If you continue to take it for more than six weeks, not only will the breasts be towering, but also all menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, and lack of sensation will be completely cured, increasing love between couples, strengthening the body and preserving youth.

### The Most Reasonable Treatment for Seminal Emission

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Many people suspect that seminal emission in young people is difficult to cure. This is a misconception. If there is a good doctor here who can find the root cause of the disease and then prescribe the right medicine, then there is no way that it will not be effective day by day. As the saying goes, "The right medicine is like opening a lock." This is an easy thing to do. If you cannot find the root cause of the disease, or know the root cause but do not have the appropriate medicine, then it is very difficult. Therefore, we only admit the difficulty in measuring the root cause of seminal emission and the lack of effective medicines for treating seminal emission, but we do not admit that seminal emission is difficult to treat.

Facts speak louder than words. Many seminal emission patients who were immersed in the sea of suffering have regained the path of light after we prescribed the right medicine. Because according to our many years of experience, we deeply know that seminal emission is mostly caused by young people committing self-pollution and licentiousness, which weakens the sexual nerves and relaxes the sperm gate. The semen in the seminal vesicles cannot be controlled, and then seminal emission and spermatorrhea occur, and even premature ejaculation occurs. And with this phenomenon, it must be prevented as soon as possible. Otherwise, the sperm gate will become looser and looser with each emission, and the sexual nerves will become weaker and weaker with each emission, and then there will be the danger of sperm exhaustion, blood depletion, and hundreds of diseases! The most common ones are brain decay and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney deficiency and impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging. If you get to this point, not only will your future and happiness be lost, but also your vitality will be greatly lost, and your vitality will be dying!

The reasonable treatment for seminal emission is to start by consolidating the sperm gate and calming the nerves. "Himitot's Sperm-Solidifying Tablets," secretly prepared by German Dr. Himitot, completely has this function. Patients will be able to consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, get a good night's sleep, reduce dreams, and seminal emission can be stopped on the same night. If seminal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Gonadotropin" to nourish the brain, kidneys, sperm, blood, and nerves, and continuing to take it will definitely cure all symptoms in a short period of time, so that the body will become healthier. If patients can come to this clinic in person to use electrotherapy injections and other methods, the effect will be even faster!

### A New Solution for Diffuse Leucorrhea

After the poison of turbidity has been conquered by the newly invented special medicine "Da ○ Liu," its severity of epidemic is far less than before, and the one that has taken its place is the disease of gonorrhea. Not only is it as prevalent as syphilis used to be, but it is even worse than before. Because of the diffusion of gonorrhea, in many large cities, there are actually more men suffering from gonorrhea than healthy men, which is an undeniable fact. Therefore, we must conduct a thorough study on the treatment of gonorrhea in order to quickly eliminate this raging gonorrhea. However, as for most municipal doctors who stick to old methods, they often stubbornly adhere to a certain treatment method, such as using only one drug or one surgery, to deal with the ever-changing gonorrhea. How can they expect the gonorrhea to be cured day by day and return our happiness? Nowadays, doctors with a little bit of modern thinking feel that the treatment of gonorrhea, especially the need to deal with diffuse gonorrhea, is a matter of urgency. Now let's talk about it separately.

The diagnosis and treatment of stubborn and diffuse leucorrhea should be given the greatest effort to study. First of all, a precise diagnosis is made to determine whether it belongs to acute or chronic gonorrhea, including anterior and posterior urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, joint inflammation, and cystitis, and then the right treatment is used so that it can be cured in the near future. For example, gonorrheal arthritis, orchitis, etc., must be treated with German Hee's serum injection in order to eliminate the widespread gonococcus, and mechanical therapy should not be used for cystitis in the early stage, but if it is too difficult to treat, washing can be performed. For prostatitis, vibration massage, Wen's cooling method, electrical massage, and suppositories can be selected. It can be seen that even for a certain symptom of gonorrheal, there are many treatments. Are those who stubbornly adhere to a certain treatment method or a certain inferior drug to deal with it not deceiving others? As for electrotherapy methods, the German filter electrolytic current therapy is even more effective in treating various diseases.

### Cotton Yarn: Speculation Exhausted, Yarn Market Fluctuates Wildly, While Da Wang Seizes the Opportunity to Sell off Stockpiled Yarn of Over 100,000 Bales

Current situation: This morning, at the opening, attendees, realizing the current market is turbulent, mostly started trading early. The opening was relatively peaceful. Shuang Ma brand yarn was priced at 425.5 yuan per single bale, and foreign-stored yarn was at 466 yuan, an increase of 1.5 to 4 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the Mu Yang (Shepherd) brand, priced at 492.5 yuan, suddenly moved. Soon after, buying momentum surged, creating an unbearable din. Shouting was chaotic. In an instant, 20 bales of Shuang Ma foreign-stored yarn were priced at 470 yuan, and single bales at 461 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the high price, some profits were cashed out, and a downward trend abruptly started. Foreign-stored Shuang Ma fell again to 463 yuan, and single bales to 454 yuan, a difference of 6 or 7 yuan in a flash. It is conceivable that there are many who are stirring up trouble. The closing was flat. In the afternoon, the opening was still slow, and rumors resurfaced, saying that the situation for stocks and gold was becoming favorable. The market price rose step by step. The price of 20 bales of Shuang Ma foreign-stored yarn rose again to 470 yuan, and single bales to 461 yuan, with buying difficult. However, actual transactions were still scattered as usual, while the mood was unusually heated. The closing price for 20 bales of Shuang Ma spot goods was 470 yuan, and single bales at 461.5 yuan. It is found that a total of 3,850 bales were purchased by various trading groups today. The market price: 10-count Shuang Ma yarn rose 7 yuan, Shuang Qiu (Double Globe) rose 7 yuan, Mu Yang rose 1.5 yuan, Wu Fu (Five Blessings) rose 3 yuan, 10-count yarn was flat, and 32-count single yarn tended to fall. Today, 440 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 70 pieces to Yantai, 955 pieces to Shantou, and 345 pieces to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various trading groups are listed below:

Same trade: 2,710 bales Hong Kong: 470 bales

Shantou: 105 bales Yunnan: 445 bales

Wenzhou: 10 bales Inland: 110 bales

Total: 3,850 bales

The Japanese yarn market continued to rise. "Piqiu" (speculative) trading was very active, but actual sales in various regions showed no appetite. Most people are speculating on exchange bills, resulting in extreme volatility. Yueqin yarn rose to 398 yuan in the morning, then fell to 392 yuan, and then rose again to 396 yuan in the afternoon.

According to sources, warehouses of various Shanghai banks and foreign firms are filled with stockpiles of yarn and cloth, exceeding hundreds of thousands of bales. Recent transshipment and hoarding are not included. Yarn factories are taking advantage of high prices to sell some of their inventory to meet demand.

### Slight Movement by Manufacturers, Cotton Market Expanding

Foreign cotton transactions stalled, existing orders sufficient for three months.

Trading in both Chinese and foreign spot cotton showed growth, but factory purchases remained moderate. Apart from Shen Xin, Hong Zhang, and Xin Sheng factories having slight needs, others showed no activity. Japanese factories, both domestic and Shanghai, purchased several hundred bales of Chinese cotton, due to its pure white color. Similar to Indian cotton, domestic traders were also stimulated by foreign markets, showing strong interest in trading and actively buying. As a result, market prices soared. Only 106 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived from Northern Jiangsu. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded below.

It is also reported that Shanghai Chinese and foreign yarn factories have purchased near- and long-term foreign cotton, with exchange bills settled upon purchase. The amount is said to be around 800,000 bales, sufficient for three months of use by the factories.

Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton prices initially rose due to positive news from He Wuqing and active new buyers, as well as higher spot prices. Later, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace's meeting with Roosevelt, strongly advocating export subsidies, triggered buying, resulting in a closing increase of 3-5 points per pound. India was closed, with no change expected. Egypt rose over 20 points per pound.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: Yesterday, the black market exchange rate was still chaotic. Smaller factories, with weaker financial resources and thinner inventories, had sold too much cotton yarn earlier, fearing difficulties in purchasing cotton in the future. Yesterday, they reluctantly bought several thousand pieces of Indian cotton. All foreign cotton was sold by traders after making substantial profits. Foreign cotton firms have not been dealing in single bales since Wednesday. Therefore, foreign firms will continue trading after the foreign exchange stabilizes.

### Sugar Market: National Sugar Tight, Coarse White Also Firm

Yesterday's sugar market, according to a London telegram, increased by 1.75 pence for August, to 6 shillings and 11.25 pence. December increased to 6 shillings and 1 penny, and March of next year increased to 6 shillings and 1.5 pence, all up 1 penny. A Dutch telegram reported 1,500 bags of coarse sand were settled at 8.45 Dutch guilders for July-August. Therefore, the Shanghai Sugar Association's price trends remained firm. Spot 24 coarse sugar rose 4 jiao at the local warehouse, to 29.4 yuan, and rose 2 jiao at foreign warehouses, to 29 yuan. Transit goods initially traded at the original price of 20.7 yuan for 1,600 bags, and then rose 3 jiao to 21 yuan for 200 bags. Taikoo granulated white sugar, B grade spot goods, were initially priced flat, with 1,200 bags sold at 28.5 yuan, and then rose to 28.8 yuan, totaling 300 bags. Dutch red sugar remained unchanged, with transit goods trading at 13.7 yuan for 100 bags. Local cotton white sugar rose half a yuan, with Zhen Ji No. 1 at 28.5 yuan, No. 2 at 28 yuan, No. 3 at 27.5 yuan, and No. 4 at 27 yuan. Domestic sugar was gradually tightening, with Chaozhou sugar at 14 yuan and Jian sugar at 14.1 yuan, totaling 326 bags. Cotton red sugar was at 15.8 yuan to 15.45/46 jiao, over 300 bags. Huanggang ordinary Qing sugar was at 14.8 yuan, and Huizhou white sugar at 24.6 yuan, totaling over 100 bags.

### Grain: Flour Mill Prices Rise Again by One Jiao

Flour: Yesterday, the market showed strength. Since the tightening of foreign exchange, goods directly or indirectly related to foreign goods have generally risen sharply, especially the soaring gold prices, which have raised expectations. Yesterday, various mills continued to refuse customer orders, while small retail transactions in the market were still being supplied as usual, but mill prices had increased by another jiao. No. 2 flour rose from 4.45 yuan to 4.55 yuan. It is heard that medium-grade foreign flour also rose from 4.43/44 yuan to 4.55 yuan, with higher-grade brands requiring an additional 5 fen to 1 jiao. Currently, with new wheat coming to market and foreign wheat pouring in, the market is not looking good. However, the sharp fluctuations in foreign exchange have created an opportunity for rising prices. In addition, the Beiyang group is actively purchasing and packaging foreign flour, and also shows strong appetite for domestic flour. According to customer sources, after initially refusing customer sales in the morning, a batch of transactions was made in the evening market at a price of 4.55 yuan.

Wheat: Yesterday, there was no formal market for new wheat. New samples from various production areas were continuously sent to Shanghai, pitched to flour mills and foreign merchants. However, with foreign wheat arriving in large quantities and new wheat being damp and soft, it was not welcomed by manufacturers. Purchases were moderate. It is rumored that two batches of new Nanjing wheat, totaling 140 bags, had arrived. It was said that the price was being kept secret, and they were sold directly to the factory at a price of 5.7 yuan. Since both buyers and sellers remained silent, the market was not publicly announced.

Exports: Today, 13,500 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin, another 1,000 bags to Weihaiwei, and another 17,000 bags to Shantou, along with 400 bags of bran to Hong Kong.

2,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Settled

### 

Foreign Rice: Yesterday, the market suddenly changed unexpectedly. It is rumored that 2,000 tons of Saigon rice agreed upon by grain merchants were fully settled and returned yesterday due to the impact of the suspension of foreign exchange sales. A surplus of 56,000 yuan was gained from the foreign exchange settlement, but 31,000 yuan had to be paid for shipping and all losses, leaving the grain merchants with a net surplus of 25,000 yuan. Due to the above news, the current foreign rice market has also been affected. Current foreign rice inventory is less than 10,000 bags. With the source cut off, everyone is expecting prices to rise. Retail prices for ten or twenty bags rose by 3 jiao, selling at 19.3 yuan to 19.35 yuan, while one or two hundred bags were asking for 19.5/5.6 yuan, with delivery yet to be settled.

Glutinous Rice: Due to the sudden release of foreign glutinous rice, the price fell by more than 2 jiao.

### Dredging the Mouth of the Wusong River

The Wusong River mouth, i.e., the Suzhou Creek project, at that time, a dam was built west of the Great King Temple. The area to the east was not heavily silted, and the river was wide, making dam construction difficult, so dredging was not undertaken. Foreign merchants have been discussing this for some time. Now, Prefect Li has come to Shanghai to inspect the bund and embankment project. Consular officials and others invited him to Yihua Wharf, where they boarded a small steamship. Experts from the Public Works Bureau, familiar with water management, measured the depth of the river to the original dam site west of the New Gate. It is said that the river mouth will be dredged again. This decision will use steam-powered dredging machines and will not involve building dams.

### Presenting an Umbrella for Virtuous Governance

The ban on female waitresses in the concession area has pleased gentlemen, scholars, and merchants alike. Now, gentlemen and merchants in the concession area, in gratitude for the virtuous governance of Consul-General Medhurst and others, embroidered a "Ten Thousand People's Canopy" and presented it to the consulate last Saturday. It was graciously received, with warm and respectful hospitality. Since Consul-General Medhurst took office in Shanghai, he has protected the shops and residents within the concession area in an exemplary manner, earning the trust of the people. This time, regarding female waitresses and opium dens, upon receiving a notice from the Daotai, he immediately assisted in banning them completely. The Daotai has couplets praising his virtue. Since the benefits have been shared by all, it is fitting to praise Consul-General Medhurst and present the canopy.

### Edict on Burning Books

Strange! The new policies of Japan have even led to the burning of books. Yesterday, a friend returned from Japan, carrying a heavy load of books. When asked, he said, "These are the ashes of what remains." Surprised, I asked why. He replied, "Japan has long admired China's culture and writings, and has purchased books from ancient to modern times. Those shelved and labeled are all rare editions. Now, the ruler intends to use Western writing and has banned Chinese books. It is said that hundreds of thousands of volumes have been gathered and destroyed. Therefore, I took them from the collections of scholars and book collectors to bring them back to China, to avoid another Qin Shi Huang burning of books."

Spring and Autumn

### The Price Increase of Park Tickets

— Xin Meng

Shanghai is so crowded, and the air is so polluted. Everyone is happy to go for a walk if there is a park nearby, especially in the hot weather, when parks are the best place to cool off. Therefore, people living near parks usually buy several long-term tickets per family to visit the park every day.

Originally, long-term tickets were not color-coded and were the same for both men and women. So, as long as you bought a ticket, anyone could enter, regardless of gender. But since the year before last, the colors for men and women have been different. This means that even a small family of husband and wife must each buy a long-term ticket.

Last year, the method changed again. The long-term tickets that were valid for all parks were increased to two yuan per ticket, while individual tickets were only one yuan. So-called individual tickets meant that if you bought a ticket that only allowed you to visit Zhaofeng Park, then it would not be valid for the Bund Park or the Jiaozhou Park, and you would have to buy temporary tickets.

According to the Public Concession Park regulations, the validity period of a long-term ticket is one year, from June 1st to May 31st of the following year. Now is the time to renew the tickets, but the long-term tickets valid for all parks are going to be increased to three yuan again. If Zhaofeng Park is excluded, then it remains one yuan as before.

This method was proposed by the Works Committee to the Board of Directors of the Public Concession. The reason given was that, after the concession became crowded, the number of visitors to Zhaofeng Park increased daily, creating an unprecedented new record. With so many visitors, the park's facilities are inevitably being damaged, and some people are dragging chairs, trampling on flowers, and throwing melon rinds and fruit peels everywhere. In other words, the price is being increased to limit visitors, and some even suggested raising it to five yuan per ticket. On the other hand, Jiaozhou Park and the Bund Park are not being increased because there are not many visitors.

This method is somewhat unsatisfactory to us. The reason why Zhaofeng Park has so many visitors is because the park is large, the open spaces are clear and fresh, and the facilities are relatively perfect. As for Jiaozhou Park, the place is small, there are not many trees, and the air in the Bund Park is as polluted as in the downtown area. The reason for having parks in the concession is to provide residents with rest and recreation. The air in the concession is polluted everywhere, and it is natural for people to be able to go to a park like Zhaofeng Park to clear their minds and benefit their health. But the price has been increased to three times the original price.

If this decision to increase prices is to reduce park visitors, then the concession authorities are paying attention to the health problems of residents, giving vaccinations and inoculations, and have always actively promoted them. If they believe that regular visits to the park can also reduce disease and benefit health, then it seems somewhat contradictory. If it is said that visitors intentionally damage flowers and plants, I can say that this is only a small number. Educated people would never do this. For example, parks do not allow picking of any flowers. If someone picks a flower, they will be punished. We have never seen a visitor picking flowers. Therefore, for visitors who do not follow the rules, you can increase the number of police officers and implement strict surveillance. In short, we believe that this decision to increase prices is unnecessary. If the price increase really prevents many people from visiting the park, then it is not the original purpose of establishing the park. On the other hand, people who visit the park should, of course, be vigilant and not damage any flowers or plants in the park, and not violate the rules of the park, so that people leave us with a good impression, which is also an important thing.

### Reply to a Copper Coin Collector

— The Editor

Your "Confession" has been received. If your "Confession" is indeed true, then the article "Where Have Shanghai's Copper Coins Gone?" from the fourth day is unrelated to you. Please do not feel "ashamed" or "uneasy."

According to your "Confession," because of unemployment, you are collecting copper coins from various places for a certain company to earn a small profit. The reason why the company wants you to collect copper coins is to cope with the "change" needed in the daily sales department. Since it is to cope with "change," then these copper coins are still circulating in the market. But the current problem is that Shanghai is experiencing a large shortage of copper coins. This shows that there is another group of "copper coin collectors" who are transporting the copper coins to another place—this is also the reason that you call "unknown" in your "Confession." And all I can tell you is just that.

But you also need to pay attention to whether this so-called "certain company" is, as you imagine, only buying copper coins to "cope with the change" in the sales department, and asking you to collect copper coins. I hope you can find a better job, and at the same time "pay attention" to your current job.

### Thoughts on "Made For Each Other"

— Bai Hua

"Made For Each Other"

After watching "Made For Each Other," my heart felt as if it was weighed down by a heavy lead block, and the shadow of James Stewart was always looming before my eyes. Is this poor little clerk really going to end up like "Made For Each Other": a harmonious mother-in-law and daughter-in-law; a promotion to a senior clerk; and the re-establishment of a happy and complete family?

Looking around us (naturally, I include myself), we can find the shadow of James Stewart on almost everyone's face. Their dreams, like the passing of time, have left no trace, and all the unfortunate encounters are pressing him step by step. Their ending is unimaginable?

I think every James Stewart who shares the same fate will feel the same as me after watching this play.

The reason why "Made For Each Other" is so deeply touching is first and foremost that it has found such a realistic subject matter. Second, it is the superb acting skills of James Stewart and Carole Lombard. And the outstanding skills of the director, John Cromwell, are the biggest key to helping this film succeed.

John Hammerson, the assistant in James Stewart's law firm, has achieved the greatest success. He is loyal to his duties and cowardly. He practices his resignation speech all night long, but when he sees the lawyer Doolittle, he mumbles and dares not open his mouth, but instead receives the news of a pay cut. And the joy of being immersed in love, and the excitement of becoming a father for the first time, can all express the character of such a person.

Carole Lombard, contrary to her past style, plays Hammerson's wife. She is gentle, considerate, and loves her husband. And in family quarrels, after the child falls ill, her anger and grief, the characters who are completely different before and after, surpass her previous acting skills.

John Cromwell's outstanding skills can be described in several aspects:

First: The grasp of character. The character of Hammerson, from the beginning of his engagement with Jean, is always portrayed very vividly. Such as holding a photo to the law firm, and asking Doolittle for a honeymoon trip, the family life after marriage ... writing a small clerk who is just immersed in a sweet life, and is kind and lovely. After that, all misfortunes followed one after another. When the cowardly Hammerson was forced to a dead end, he could only scold loudly, and drink. The director portrayed Hammerson's character from every small action.

Second: The grasp of emotional atmosphere. This can also be divided into two parts, the first part is light and lively, and the back part is in strong contrast, and every scene tightly pulls the audience's heart, and refuses to let go.

Third: Focus on economic oppression, such as debt collection at banquets; paying hospital bills after giving birth (stamping the "Paid" stamp on the bill); borrowing 5,000 yuan from Doolittle after the child is sick, and so on. Explaining what caused the plight of this young couple from this aspect is very moving.

Other aspects, such as the simplicity of the picture weaving, the use of lens angles and lighting, all help the wooden film achieve artistic success.

Since the reopening of the Great Shanghai Theater, this is the best play, and because the past selection criteria were too low, "Made For Each Other" did not attract the attention of the audience, which is a great regret. However, this also gives a good lesson: specializing in "business eyes" is not the best business method.

### After the Rain

Chapter Eleven: Recognizing Fellow Villagers in an Old Mortar-and-Pestle Life, Attaching to Power and Wealth in a New Aristocracy

Zhao Letian later gave up on that idea. How could a patriotic man keep the two words "love" lodged in his heart? How could he constantly keep a beautiful figure in his mind? He practiced shooting, and every shot hit the mark. He was originally the best shooter. Later, he joined a certain volunteer army, and became a machine gunner, and also the most skilled machine gunner. Other machine gunners would fire their machine guns wildly, even without seeing the enemy's shadow. Zhao Letian refused to do so. He said, "We must cherish our bullets, and we cannot fire our guns aimlessly. You only hear the sound of 'tat-tat-tat' for a while, and you don't know how much value this burst of sound costs. Our military supplies are not easy to come by, and we cannot waste them." Because Zhao Letian aimed accurately and was good at concealment, the enemy did not know where his bullets were coming from. He would gently fire a few bursts, without continuing for too long continuously. But there would be people falling to the ground, one here and one there. Several of his team members were used to hearing Zhao Letian's machine gun. They knew it was his as soon as they heard it. "Tat-tat-tat, tat-tat-tat," the sound was short, sharp, and concise, unlike those long and weak bursts. This was because he did not want to waste bullets, and knew where to stop. Later, he was promoted to a captain. When he fought against others, he would still fire the machine gun himself. Once, there was a night attack, and they were also trying to seize the enemy's heavy vehicles. Their team had only two or three hundred men, but they were scattered everywhere, ambushing on all sides. The enemy had an equal number of men, and their military equipment was much better than ours. But in the dark of dusk, they did not know how many men we had. Our men were constantly moving around, because we were familiar with the terrain. For example, after firing a few shots here, we would quickly move over there and fire a few shots again, pretending to be many in number. Our machine guns were also constantly moving around, "tat-tat-tat" here, "tat-tat-tat" there, causing the enemy to run around blindly, not knowing where to go. At that time, many of them were killed by us. Especially Zhao Letian's machine gun, he was also constantly moving around, firing a few bursts of "tat-tat-tat," and he would see several black shadows arching over and unable to get up. But he didn't know that there was a soldier, holding a hand grenade in his hand, when he was hit by a machine gun bullet in the shoulder, he saw a flash of light in the bushes in front of him, and he threw the hand grenade over. He originally wanted to destroy the machine gun, but with a "bang," the machine gun was not hit, but the hand grenade bounced up from the ground and injured Zhao Letian's foot. It was truly said:

Do not forget the noble-minded, Yuan Yong, it is difficult to bury the hero's bloody deeds (133)

### A Few Opinions on the Theater Movement

— Yang Fei

Discarding the old plays that are outdated in terms of awareness, low in taste, commonplace, and boring, and that includes even improved Peking opera, Cantonese opera, and even civilized plays. As long as the content is connected with reality, can inspire the audience's sense of justice, the dialogue and lyrics are relatively popular and easy to understand, and the makeup and scenery adopt new-style techniques, then a progressive and meaningful new path will be opened in the theater world.

Therefore, we do need the dramas written and directed by Ah Ying, Yu Ling, Li Jianwu, etc. We also need the improved Peking opera directed by Ouyang Yuqian, and the improved Cantonese opera arranged by the Yong'an Theater Company (such as "The Story of Jing Ke," although the material is poorer).

I hope that these many new drama activists can cooperate, exchange experiences, and discuss improvements with each other. It is best to perform in alternating venues or in the same venue (like at the New Year's Day Artist Reunion at the Franco-Chinese Drama and Art Society) to attract audiences from multiple directions, so that audiences can exchange the money they spend on foreign films and the energy they spend on frivolous entertainment for some nourishing spiritual food.

Recently, Yu Ling's adaptation of "The Whole City in Storm" was performed at the New Light Theater, and the "New Experimental Theater" held a weekly performance of "Tartuffe." The drama world, which has always stood at the forefront of the theater movement, is still striving in such a thorny isolated environment. It is worthy of our admiration and joy. However, I feel that the drama movement must also take into account the audience who have inherited their tastes and habits. If we want to win them over, then the drama world's lone struggle is not enough. We should unite with those in the old drama world to achieve "the unity of the Shanghai drama community, to jointly discuss and promote the new development of the theater movement."

I hope that this matter can be realized quickly.

Finally, I also hope that my fellow countrymen who love to watch dramas or movies will always be vigilant and not just send their money and energy to meaningless entertainment that numbs the soul. Save it and go see a new drama with a clearer message, in order to obtain some meaningful entertainment!

### Joint Photography Exhibition of Shanghai Photographers Featuring Film Stars

— Xin Shi

Large-Scale Charity Sale Mobilizes Extensive Collection

Over a Thousand Exquisite Works of Various Kinds

Madam Li Qinian, a renowned film star from South China, recently held a charity sale of several hundred of her own photographs in Hong Kong, with the proceeds used to aid refugees. As a leading star with the largest audience in the region, Madam Li's portraits were cherished by film fans, and her charitable act garnered widespread sympathy. Consequently, the event was a great success, benefiting many refugees.

Motivated by Charity, numerous photographers in Shanghai, inspired by Madam Li's righteous and commendable actions, sought to emulate her. Recently, dozens of individuals, including Du Ao, Weng Feipeng, Mu Yilong, Li Shifang, Ma Yonghua, and He Zuoming, jointly initiated and expanded the organization of the "Chinese Film Photograph Photographers Association." They plan to compile over a thousand works and hold a grand "Exhibition of Film Star Photographs."

Organizational Details. After several days of meetings, the essential arrangements for this event have been agreed upon. Regarding the organization, Du [blank space], Mu Yilong, and Li Shifang, among seven others, have been appointed as preparation committee members, with Wu Liande taking charge of the overall coordination. Internal affairs are divided into six sections: general affairs, collection, administration, finance, publicity, etc., each managed by dedicated personnel working collaboratively. Simultaneously, they have requested the assistance of the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center in co-organizing the event. All proceeds from the sales will be donated to the center's expenses.

Exhibition Details. The exhibition will feature photographs in nine categories, including photo albums, enlarged photographs, grouped small photographs, film stills, color photographs, color-printed paintings, and slides, with single-person photographs of Chinese film stars as the main focus. This category includes stars such as Bai Die, Gu Lanjun, Yuan Meiyun, Chen Yunshang, Jin Yan [blank space], Gao Zhanfei, and Zhao Dan, as well as early stars like Yang Naimei and Zhang Zhiyun, and deceased stars like Ruan Lingyu, Ye Juanjuan, and Lu Lixia, totaling over one hundred individuals. All exhibited photographs will be standardized at twelve inches, with a uniform price of four yuan per print.

Star Autographs. The exhibition is scheduled to last for ten days. During this period, special arrangements have been made to feature enlarged color photographs of ten leading female stars, each with a beautifully framed display. Each day, a different star will be invited to attend and sign the special photographs for purchasers. The price for each of these photographs will be at least fifty yuan, and only one print per star will be offered to ensure exclusivity.

Exhibition Dates Confirmed. The exhibition venue has been tentatively set at the fourth-floor auditorium of the New World Company, with the dates scheduled from July 18th to July 27th, a total of ten days. After the conclusion of the Shanghai exhibition, all exhibits will be transported to Hong Kong for another grand exhibition.

All Renowned Photographers in Shanghai have demonstrated a commendable sense of justice, using their collective strength to hold a large-scale charity sale. Their enthusiasm is highly admirable. Film star photographs are popular among film fans, and this collective effort, combined with Madam Li Qinian's individual exhibition, will undoubtedly yield much greater results. It is expected that the outcome will be excellent, bringing immeasurable benefits to the refugees.

### White Residence Opera Performance Canceled

Telegrams Dispatched to Inform All Celebrated Performers. Madam White to Leave Shanghai to Avoid Birthday Festivities.

This publication has reported on the preparations for the White Residence opera performance in detail, and everyone eagerly hoped for its realization. However, yesterday, reporters learned that the performance has been canceled. According to a well-informed source, the White Residence, after careful consideration, cited several reasons. First, relatives advised against excessive extravagance during these times. Second, the extensive publicity made logistical arrangements difficult. Third, the approaching birthday left insufficient time for preparation. Therefore, they canceled the opera performance. Telegrams have been sent to renowned performers in Beiping and Tianjin, requesting them not to travel south. Madam White and Mr. White are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 13th to avoid the birthday celebrations, destination not yet announced. It is said that Mr. White is German, which explains why he is unfamiliar to most people.

### Continental Swimming Pool to Host Swimming Competition of Movie Stars

— Gao Feng

The Continental Swimming Pool, which has caused a sensation throughout Shanghai, coincidentally opened yesterday on one of the hottest days of the year. Despite the scorching sun melting the asphalt, Jing'an Temple Road remained crowded with people heading toward the Continental Swimming Pool. The opening ceremony featured music performed by the Luoping Dance Troupe from the Celestial Music Palace. Soon, lively music filled the air from the loudspeakers, and many Chinese and Western swimming enthusiasts, who had been waiting eagerly by the poolside, plunged into the water, creating a cacophony of sounds. In an instant, the large swimming pool was filled to capacity.

As I circled the surrounding stands, I noticed that numerous male and female movie stars and Peking Opera performers were occupying the small round tables, sipping cold drinks. At this moment, I met the managers of the pool, Mr. Lu Jiajun and Mr. Wu Ruisheng, who informed me that they are actively planning a swimming competition for movie stars. If this plan materializes, this vast aquatic paradise will surely be packed with countless film fans and swimming enthusiasts! This year, the Continental Swimming Pool has emerged in a new form before the five million residents of the isolated island. Its sensation is not accidental, but inevitable.

### Celestial Music Palace Adds Night Garden

—Rental of Celebration Halls

Since Mr. Xie Baosheng, a well-known figure in Shanghai, took over the Celestial Music Palace, half a year has passed. The arrangement of lighting, adjustment of music, selection of dancers, preparation of food and drinks, and training of staff have all been meticulously studied and diligently managed. Its supremacy in the East is certainly not a matter of luck. High-class ladies have come to deeply appreciate this pleasure palace, and the visits are constant. As a result, the business of the dance hall is booming, breaking all previous records. Recently, Mr. Xie has added a night garden to the front of the square, laying out lawns, planting flowers and trees, and adding cold drinks, snacks, and wine, to promote summer entertainment and enhance the dance atmosphere for the guests. The arrangements are now complete and will soon open. At that time, with carriages and horses passing by, there will surely be a grand scene. In addition, because of its central location, convenient transportation, and magnificent architecture, the dance hall does not hold social tea dances on Sundays, so it is often rented for weddings or birthday celebrations. The China Group Wedding Service has held all its group weddings in the dance hall. If you need a grand hall, you can contact them directly, and they will certainly be satisfied.

Cannon Eight Advances to Five, Pawn Six Advances to Five, Horse Seven Advances to Six. Explanation: In this situation, sending the central pawn and then retreating the chariot three spaces, capturing the pawn, is also excellent. Compared to using the hole-heart cannon to attack the pawn in the previous game, the cannon attack is stronger than capturing with the chariot. The goal of chariot two advances to three is to suppress the horse. In this way, one chariot can control three pieces. Capturing the pawn by retreating the chariot three spaces seems like a waste of talent.

Cannon Eight Advances to Five, Pawn Six Advances to Five. This is inevitable. Horse Seven Advances to Six shows that retreating the chariot frees the horse. Although both sides do not lose initiative at this time, the cannon strike is bolder. The reason for using the chariot retreat capture method in this game is only to allow learners to know the outline.

Shadows of the Dance World (26)
— Xiao Tian

### Special on Shu Yunzhu

Anyone who wanders through the Celestial Music Palace probably knows about the Big Hangzhou and the Little Hangzhou. Big Hangzhou is approaching her prime, and her worldly wisdom is well-rounded. Has she recently left the dance hall to marry or retire? Outsiders cannot know. Little Hangzhou's stage name is Shu Yunlan. At twenty years old, she has grown up and has some worldly wisdom, but her innocence has not completely disappeared. She is usually quite reserved, only occasionally revealing her true self to acquaintances. Many of my friends enjoy dancing with her. Generally, Little Hangzhou's actions follow those of Big Hangzhou. (26) After Big Hangzhou's retirement from the dance hall, Little Hangzhou often has to take on the role alone. And succeeding to Little Hangzhou's position, there is also a Little Little Hangzhou.

Little Little Hangzhou, there was no name for her in the dance world at first. I had no name for her, so I named her myself. Her stage name is Shu Yunzhu. Some say she is Little Hangzhou's younger sister. Little Hangzhou herself acknowledges that she is her younger sister. But looking at their appearance, it does not seem so. Little Hangzhou calls her Ah Hui. Guests who jokingly call her Ah Hui get a little upset, saying, "You can call me Ah Zhu." In short, dance girls' family matters often have unspeakable secrets. One should pity them and not force an exploration. Or perhaps I know it but should not reveal it. If so, that is the gentlemanly way.

Yunzhu is tall and slender, about twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old. She does not adorn herself. One cannot call her beautiful, but one cannot deny her charm. She is innocent and lively, like a forget-me-not, like a flower that understands words. She has Charlie Chaplin's humor and Shirley Temple's wit. My friend Mr. Song appreciates her very much, without any hint of male-female thoughts. Yunzhu has a large capacity for alcohol and is good at singing. When she is tipsy, she starts singing loudly, regardless of the people sitting next to her. Both Chinese and Western songs popular in the dance hall are no problem. Even Shanghai opera, Suzhou ballads, Peking opera, and even Shaoxing opera, she mostly has the next line if you have the first. If you happen to be feeling down, you might as well invite her for a meal, which can be worth a dose of anti-anxiety medicine. Usually, she does not pay much attention to tickets, but occasionally, when she eats dumplings, she also knows how to frown, probably fearing criticism. She dances tea dances at the Great China, and tonight she dances at the Metropolis with her sister, sitting at the neighboring table with the Cao Suqin sisters.

Yu Shuyan's Biggest Reason for Not Wanting to Perform

I was sitting alone in the place where Weisheng was dressing up and chatting with him, but I didn't want to stand there with them as a punishment. Who knew that after waiting for a while, Ma Lianliang, dressed as Fan Zhongyan, appeared on stage. I quickly asked the people backstage, "What's going on? Is Shuyan going to perform or not?" Unexpectedly, they were even more confused than I was. They all said that Yu San's words are never certain. His skills on stage are all done by people, but his private personality is not human. Loyalty, filial piety, and integrity are all sung on stage, so privately, he is unbenevolent and unjust. All in all, one play takes at most an hour, and he earns three or four thousand yuan, and he still has to maintain his airs, relying on the boss's pleasure. In the past, Boss Tan's appearances were only two hundred yuan each, and he was a bit over the top. After hearing this old stagehand's discussion, I felt that something was unreliable today. I wanted to call the few people who came with me to leave together, but the entrance and exit doors were full of people. An actor dressed as a fierce god was shouting in the crowd, "Everyone, please make way, it's my turn to go out," pushing and shouting, and it took him a long time to squeeze out. I thought this situation was not right, so I'd better slip away alone. The next day, I saw Mr. Chuan and learned that Little Yu had cheated people again, making the family and the male and female guests very angry. That day, because the stage was full of people, the people in the audience were affected. Among them, a modern young lady wearing high heels stood for half a day, and of course she was tired. In an unguarded moment, she was pushed by someone and almost fell onto the stage. Coincidentally, Lianliang's musician Zhao Guiyuan was playing "Flat Erhuang" when she bumped into him, and the erhu fell to the ground, and all the strings broke. Although the spectators could forgive them for this special situation, Lianliang was very bad-tempered and immediately started scolding. Later, Zhao Guiyuan was replaced by Yang Baozhong, because of this choice of the zither (not Bo Ya) breaking the strings.

Beiping is the place where [blank space] has lived for generations, and it is very close, but he can repeatedly change his mind at the last minute, causing great disappointment. How can anyone be sure whether he will attend a certain house party in Shanghai, which is far away? No one can say for sure that he will come to participate in someone's home performance unless he is already in Shanghai. (33)
