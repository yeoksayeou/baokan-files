### The Yu Chinese Army Recovers Kaifeng and Tongxu: Intense Street Fighting Erupts as the Main Force Enters Bian from the Southwest and West Passes; Puppet Organizations, Japanese Ammunition Depots and Warehouses All Aflame

Luoyang: A telephone call from Zhengzhou reported that the previously silent eastern Henan suddenly witnessed glorious war achievements on the night of the 16th. Kaifeng, a city considered by the Japanese to be their base, was again captured by the Chinese army on the morning of the 17th. This attack was said to be far larger in scale and inflict much heavier casualties on the Japanese than the previous five attempts. On the evening of the 16th, the Chinese army completed its deployment and launched a two-pronged attack from the west. Under the dim moonlight, they fiercely charged from the South Pass and West Pass, resulting in all-night melee. The Japanese forces were unable to withstand the assault and collapsed. The South Pass was the first to be occupied, followed by the West Pass, which also fell into Chinese hands. When the Chinese army entered the city passes, undercover Chinese teams inside the city responded, opening the gates to welcome them in while simultaneously setting fires in over twenty locations. Puppet organizations, Japanese ammunition depots, and warehouses were successively engulfed in flames. The Japanese in Bian were thrown into utter panic and intense street fighting began amidst the inferno. As of 6 PM on the 17th, the Chinese army was still engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese in Bian city. Reports indicate that Japanese casualties and losses were incalculable. Upon receiving the news, the people of Luoyang were exceedingly excited. (17th dispatch)

### The Purpose of the Winter Offensive Is to Destroy Japanese Transportation Lines, Preventing Japan from Obtaining External Aid, But It Must Rely on the Cooperation of the Military and the People

Chongqing: According to General Xue Yue of the Chinese "Steel Army," as he told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday, the purpose of the current "Winter Offensive" by the Chinese army is to destroy Japanese transportation lines. He said that the destruction of these transportation lines could lead to the rapid collapse of the Japanese army in China, as the Japanese forces are scattered throughout China, relying entirely on the transportation lines to survive. (17th United Press dispatch)

Changsha: A reporter recently visited the front line and interviewed General Xue, asking about the recent war situation in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. He said that the Chinese army is now adopting a new tactic of transportation destruction warfare, appearing behind the Japanese army in northern Hunan, northern Jiangxi, and southern Hubei, completely destroying the railways, highways, postal routes, mountain roads, and telegraph lines used by the Japanese for communication. The Japanese army has been hit hard and has fallen into an isolated and desperate situation. They will not only be unable to obtain external aid, but will inevitably starve to death. He believes that the power of transportation destruction warfare can control the lifeline of the Japanese army, but it requires the sincere cooperation of the military and the people to be effective. He expressed his deep appreciation for the trust and obedience to command shown by the people of northern Hunan when the first line of battle was engaged. He also repeatedly praised the virtue of the people of Hunan who, after destroying the roads, refused to encroach on government land and convert it into private property. The 16th marked the anniversary of his arrival in Hunan. The people of Hunan held a celebration to commemorate his rebuilding of Hunan in the past year amidst the sounds of iron horses and golden spears. He humbly declined the praise, but yielded to public sentiment and stated that in the coming year, he would resolutely follow the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief, and use the Principle of People's Livelihood as the basis for his administration. He would also use the six major departments of "enriching the people, nurturing the people, purifying the people, protecting the people, managing the people, and employing the people" as guiding principles for the administrative agencies at all levels. He ordered the administrative inspectors and county magistrates to conduct external inspections for half a year and work in their offices for the other half, in order to build a new Hunan and enable the 30 million people of southern Hunan to strive for the great project of resistance and national reconstruction.

Chongqing: According to Chinese sources today, the Japanese army has adopted a counter-offensive posture against the winter offensive launched by the Chinese army in the Yangtze River area and Shanxi. As a result, fierce battles are taking place in Nanchang, northern Hubei, and southwestern Shanxi. However, the Japanese army in Nanning has adopted a defensive posture in the past two days, abandoning its plan to advance north, and attacking the Chinese army south of Nanning, occupying several towns along the coastal highway. As for southwestern Shanxi, the Japanese army has now gathered 25,000 troops to prepare for another attack on Zhongtiao Mountain. According to Chinese military experts, the purpose of the Chinese army's offensive along the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei and southern Anhui is to cut off the transportation lines between Wuhan, Nanchang, and Nanjing. In other words, it is to cut off traffic on the Yangtze River, regardless of the Japanese navy's bombing. In the Zhongxiang and Jingshan areas of central Hubei, over two thousand Japanese soldiers were killed yesterday during the Japanese army's counter-offensive against the Chinese army. Furthermore, the Pinghan Railway between Henan and Hubei has been dismantled by the Chinese army, and the connection between the Japanese army in Wuhan and Xinyang has been lost.

The Japanese army in Nanchang also began a counter-offensive yesterday. When the Japanese attacked Longchang Bridge, 20 kilometers southeast of Nanchang, they used over a thousand Japanese soldiers, three airplanes, several tanks, artillery units, and mechanized units, and launched a fierce artillery bombardment of Longchang Bridge. The city has been completely burned down. However, the Chinese army is now threatening the flanks and rear of the main force of the Japanese army, so the Japanese army has no possibility of making any progress. (17th United Press dispatch)

### Sui Province Government Implements Three Major Political Programs

Wuyuan: The Sui Province government has recently been actively implementing three major political programs: (1) Reforming land administration to increase wartime production; (2) Punishing corruption to purify officialdom; and (3) Providing universal training to the people to strengthen resistance forces. The fundamental approach to land administration is based on the principle of "land to the tiller." The interim measures include clearing wasteland and developing land resources. Two thousand acres of good land had previously been allocated for rent-free reclamation. Poor people from Shanxi, Shandong, and Hebei who heard the news came to claim the land, and several hundred have already arrived. After examination by the provincial government, they were all given land and properly settled. Ning, a special commissioner sent to the Yimeng area to ban opium, was executed by firing squad on the 14th for embezzling over four thousand yuan, marking the first instance of the Sui Province government punishing corruption. Over sixty to seventy thousand people are undergoing universal training, which has been ongoing for over half a month. Provincial committee members are personally going to various villages to provide guidance. The people are enthusiastically participating, and the results are excellent. In addition, efforts are being made to promote the new county system. Chairman Fu stated that in order to improve politics, officials must be governed before the people can be governed, and then political reform can be expected. Therefore, those who are corrupt will be severely punished. (15th dispatch)

Editorial

### The Dynamics of the Sino-Japanese War

In the past three to five days, the Sino-Japanese war has seen renewed activity; news has come that the Chinese army has made significant progress in western Shanxi, southern Shanxi, northern Hubei, eastern Hubei, northern Hunan, northern Jiangxi, western Jiangxi, western Zhejiang, and central Henan: recovering seven or eight military strongholds and dozens of towns, all recorded in Chinese and foreign newspapers; what is particularly noteworthy and exciting is that Taiyuan, the provincial capital of Shanxi, Nanchang, the provincial capital of Jiangxi, Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, and Yuezhou, standing tall on the shores of Dongting Lake and the head of the Yangtze River, connecting the land and water routes of Hunan and Hubei provinces, have been successively broken through by detachments of the Chinese army, engaging in fierce street fighting; Kaifeng, the capital of Henan Province, which the Japanese considered their base, was also recovered yesterday morning. Observers call it the Chinese army's winter general counter-offensive.

All strategies and overall plans are conceived in secret, launched from the central command, and presided over by the commander-in-chief, with only a few generals involved in military affairs; therefore, we have no way of knowing the details, nor should we seek to know the details. Therefore, what is the significance, position, weight, and nature of the recent front-line developments in the entire Sino-Japanese War? And what kind of situation will emerge as a result of what follows? None of these are things that we should pretend to understand or lightly speculate about. However, by synthesizing the various phenomena and summarizing the various news reports, there are things that can be pondered: that is, this activity, from western Shanxi to northern Hunan, and further east to western Zhejiang, covers almost the entire Sino-Japanese front line, except for Guangdong and Guangxi; the activity of the entire front line, with its various achievements, is not a chance coincidence, but must be a planned operation. Evolving from a defensive posture to a proactive action, and affecting the entire front line, these indications are similar to a general counter-offensive; hence the term "winter general counter-offensive," but this is not the case. As far as China's war of resistance against Japan is concerned, the most satisfying thing and the most ideal situation is to win a complete victory through a general counter-offensive, with the invaders falling to the ground in defeat, either with their entire army annihilated or routed beyond repair, and the war situation between the two countries coming to an end, and the final victory being determined. The war has been going on for two and a half years, and Japan's military and financial resources have become exhausted; with time being on China's side, and China making better use of its time; with nature being exceptionally generous to China, and China making better use of its human and material resources; with international sympathy for China, and the United States and other countries being able to stop providing Japan with material aid; while Japan remains deluded, unaware of its mistakes, making ineffective efforts with exhausted strength until the final moment; then China's general counter-offensive will surely come one day, and things will fall into place naturally; that is, the most satisfying thing and the most ideal situation mentioned above will surely appear before the world one day. Looking at the overall situation, the date is not far off, but it will still be in the spring of next year or after the spring of next year. The so-called general counter-offensive is like two sides engaged in combat, with equal strength, and only the success or failure of each stage of the battle being uncertain, then general attacks and general counter-offensives can be launched repeatedly; the war between China and Japan is quite different from this. The various combat strengths and the various sources of strength of China and Japan are almost all opposite; or what China is good at is precisely what Japan is short of, or what China lacks is precisely what Japan excels at, or what China can do leisurely is what Japan is most anxious about; in short, they are not two warring countries with equal strength. Therefore, Japan can launch general attacks, is eager to launch general attacks, and has already launched general attacks repeatedly; but the reason why China is dealing with them is not only that it does not have to respond to every general attack with a general counter-offensive, but even does not need to launch a single general counter-offensive. Why? China's central consciousness in combat is to make Japan consume its resources; the way to make Japan consume its resources is not through counter-attacks, and certainly not through general counter-attacks. If Japan changes its course without waiting for China's general counter-offensive, or if it has already consumed all its resources, then China may not need to launch a general counter-offensive at all; and the general counter-offensive planned by China will only be launched once, on the eve of achieving final victory; and only on the day when it is diagnosed that Japan's resources are exhausted, not today. To call it a general counter-offensive today is just wishful thinking; it is not something that is happening or an ideal situation.

To infer the dynamics of the entire front line proactively, one must not stray far from the fundamental position of the central consciousness of combat, in other words, it is still the normal method of promoting Japan's consumption, and also another way of accelerating Japan's consumption; if we examine the successive reports of victory from various places, they often mention the destruction of enemy ammunition depots, which is because the purpose of the actions is such, the results are such, and therefore the reports are also such; the information contained within can be seen through. But there are still important secondary gains: the deployment of troops is impermanent, and the real and virtual strengths of various places vary from time to time, so it is necessary to launch operations simultaneously on the entire front line in order to test the real and virtual strengths of the enemy in various places, and the total sum of the real and virtual strengths of various places is the way to measure the total sum of the enemy's remaining strength, this is one. Japan boasts of its victories, and uses its boasts as a premise to launch its diplomatic and political offensives; this is because the essence of diplomatic and political offensives is a substitute for the failure of military offensives, but the momentum of the substitute cannot be attached to the premise of its victory; therefore, Japan in the past year has only been concerned with concealing defeats and boasting about victories; China's result of this full-line probing is not only proving that the places where the Japanese army has been are not worthy of being called "occupied areas" or "lost areas," but also proving that even a line and a point are not within the grasp of the Japanese army; what is there to talk about victory, let alone the various things based on victory, this is two. Information from the front and rear all say that the morale and public sentiment of the Chinese army are still strong and vigorous, while Japan's army is old and tired abroad, and its morale is discouraged at home; therefore, China's full-line launch makes the strong even stronger, the vigorous even more vigorous, and the old and discouraged even more discouraged and old; this is in addition to the positive gains of the military, also a "psychological warfare" tactic, this is three. However, these three all contribute to the general counter-offensive in the future; to say that China's general counter-offensive is not needed is because Japan, in view of the recent facts and trends, urgently and thoroughly changes its attitude.

### Sichuan Establishes a Opium Suppression Supervisory Office; Chiang Kai-shek, as Chairman, Concurrently Serves as Supervisor; Chief He of the Xingyuan Concurrently Serves as Deputy Supervisor

Chengdu: In order to unify the anti-opium agencies in Sichuan Province, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the abolition of all organizations such as the Sichuan Province Opium Suppression Supervisory Office, the Sichuan-Kang Opium Suppression Supervisory Office, the East Sichuan Drug Suppression Office, and the Opium Suppression Section of the Department of Civil Affairs, and reorganized them into the Sichuan Province Opium Suppression Supervisory Office, which was officially established on the 16th. Chiang Kai-shek, as Chairman, concurrently serves as the Supervisor, and Chief He of the Xingyuan concurrently serves as the Deputy Supervisor. Another Deputy Supervisor will be filled by Xu Shenfu, a local Sichuanese gentleman. Underneath, there are three departments and four offices. The First Department is in charge of banning planting and smoking opium, with Hu Juewei, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, concurrently serving as the Director. The Second Department is in charge of banning the transportation and sale of opium, with Zhang Jingyu, the former Director of the Sichuan-Kang Opium Suppression Supervisory Office, serving as the Director. The Third Department is in charge of suppressing private opium, with He Zhigang, the former Deputy Director of the Sichuan-Kang Opium Suppression Supervisory Office, serving as the Director. The directors of the Secretarial, Disciplinary, and Military Law offices are still Lei Nanlei, He Longqing, and Zhao Xianzeng. An Accounting Office is also established, with Kong Lingkun serving as the Director. In addition, assistant supervisors will be established in the eastern, southern, western, and northern districts of Sichuan to handle drug suppression affairs in their respective districts. Furthermore, the provincial government is currently actively carrying out the registration of opium addicts, with a deadline of the end of the year, and is also following the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to establish opium addiction treatment centers in all counties of the province to carry out forced rehabilitation in batches. In addition to the existing 34 opium addiction treatment hospitals, 100 county opium addiction treatment centers will be added in January next year. Preparations are currently underway to train management personnel for the opium addiction treatment centers, and to manufacture a large number of opium addiction treatment drugs for application. It is expected that the toxic atmosphere in Sichuan Province can be eliminated next year. (16th dispatch)

Before parting, he also gave each member of the delegation a recent photograph. The hosts and guests parted in great delight. (17th dispatch)

Chongqing - The Burmese delegation to China presented a eulogy to Chairman Chiang and his wife today, the gist of which was: Although there were many concerns during our plan to visit China, the earnestness of our desire was beyond words. With the completion of the Burma Road, we received new encouragement, and the desire to realize our plan became more urgent. Now that we can personally meet the distinguished Chairman and express our sincere feelings, how fortunate we are! This trip bears the mission of the entire country of Burma. We respectfully wish your country a bright and happy future, and pray for an early and glorious end to the war. Your Excellency Chairman's leadership in the War of Resistance, and your brave and indomitable spirit, are sufficient to prove that your country will win the final victory. We sincerely pray that your country will soon defeat the enemy, and compensate for the great sacrifices made in defending human justice. Some of the great women of your country, in the transition between the old and new worlds, are good at adapting, removing the habits of weakness and developing a spirit of courage and fearlessness, regarding the responsibilities of the country and the people as more important than the family. We cannot help but admire them. An old French proverb says, "The decision of law lies with men, the decision of morality lies with women." Some say that the Song family was born for China, not that China belongs to the Song family. Now, the heroines of the Song family, Madame Sun, Madame Kung, and Madame Chairman Chiang, have become the three giants of the women's world, sufficient to represent the typical women of the new China. This is why we express our deep respect. For the past twelve years, Madame Chiang's assistance to Your Excellency Chairman has been like that of Madame Sun Yat-sen to Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past. The greatness of her achievements cannot be overstated.

Xin Ba Qiao, Chairman of the All Burma Fabian Society, presented a eulogy to Chairman Chiang and his wife, saying: Our society's chairman, Mr. U Ba Qiao, decided to participate in our country's goodwill visit to your country's wartime capital, and is deeply honored to have the opportunity to pay respects to Your Excellency Chairman in person. Since Japan began its military aggression and your country has been engaged in the War of Resistance, our society has been leading the people of Burma to implement a boycott of Japanese goods, the only effective weapon to sanction aggressors. We believe that if the movement for friendship between China and Burma can remain unchanged for a long time, the result will not only allow the people of our country to admire the justice of your country and sympathize with your country's War of Resistance, but also expose the barbarism and lawlessness of the Japanese and their plans for aggression.

Chairman Chiang's reply briefly stated that the endless aggression of Japan over the years clearly shows its delusion of conquering China and conquering the world. China, mindful of world peace, has repeatedly exercised restraint and sought compromise. However, Japan has no repentance and is pressing with its military. I follow the Three Principles of the People of Prime Minister Sun Yat-sen and the national policy of the government to protect the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation, and for the sake of East Asian security and world peace, I lead the soldiers and civilians of the whole country to rise up and fight. This is my duty and historical mission. Fortunately, the whole country is united, fighting heroically, and receiving sympathy and assistance from far and near. We have fortunately broken through the most difficult predicament and are approaching the opportunity for final victory. The people of your country have always had deep friendship and have continued to assist us. I am deeply grateful. Now, I am honored by the visit and condolences of representatives from all walks of life, and honored by the glorious banners and grand eulogies, and I am deeply grateful for the condolences of the women's representatives of your country to my wife, Ms. Song. I specially represent the soldiers and civilians of the whole country and the comrades of our party to express my infinite gratitude. I firmly believe that the friendship between China and Burma, with the development of modern transportation and the efforts of both sides, will become more intimate and jointly promote prosperity.

### Letter of Thanks from the Ministry of Military Administration to the Committee for Collecting Winter Clothing; All Soldiers and Officers are Determined to Wipe Out Humiliation and Seek Revenge to Repay the Expectations of All Sectors of the Country

Chongqing - Since the beginning of this winter, the National Committee for Collecting Winter Clothing has launched a campaign to collect winter clothing in all provinces, cities, and districts of the country. Up to now, a total of × hundred × × × × × × 3,333 cotton vests have been distributed to various war zones. With this assistance, the soldiers and officers of the entire army have increased their courage to kill the enemy and serve the country. It is reported that the authorities of the Ministry of Military Administration have sent a letter to the Collection Committee on behalf of all the soldiers and officers to express their gratitude. According to a spokesman for the Ministry, the uniforms of the army have always been under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. The production and distribution of winter and summer uniforms every year are also carried out according to a certain plan. In particular, there are certain time limits for the use and storage of bedding. For example, the storage time limit for cotton-padded clothing is two years, cotton overcoats are three years, cotton vests are three years, and single clothing is one year. Two sets of single clothing are issued every year, and cotton-padded clothing is supplemented by 50% to 70% or 80% depending on the situation (fully issued to newly established troops). Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the replenishment of cotton clothing has been at least 50% or more every year. According to the storage time limit, only the losses or damaged parts should be slightly supplemented every year. However, during the war, a small number of troops did not pay enough attention to the storage of clothing, and discarded them at will when they were not needed, and felt insufficient when they were needed. Therefore, although the Ministry distributed them on average, there were surpluses and shortages in various troops and agencies. This situation is being corrected and it is hoped that it can be gradually improved in the future. In short, it is the responsibility of the Ministry to be responsible for preparing the bedding that should be issued to all soldiers and officers, no matter how difficult the situation is, so that there is no shortage. Moreover, the Collection Committee provides various assistance to extensively collect and manufacture cotton vests, which greatly benefits our soldiers and officers. Our soldiers and officers can only strengthen their determination to fight against the enemy, increase their determination to wipe out humiliation and seek revenge, drive out the Japanese army, and return our rivers and mountains, in order to repay the expectations of all sectors of the country.

### Japan Actively Promotes the Southern Advance Policy, Sending Spies to Burma to Carry Out Activities; Secret Documents Were Seized

Hong Kong - According to a report from Yangon, Masami Kuniso, a Japanese national, who was praised in his country as a pioneer of the Southern Advance Theory, was ordered by the Planning Board of his country to carry out activities in Burma. He arrived in Yangon on the 6th of this month on the Japanese ship "Hanso Maru". The Burmese Ministry of National Defense, after receiving a report, sent secret agents to wait at the pier and conduct an inspection when the ship landed. Many secret documents were seized from the spy, the important contents of which are as follows: (1) Pay close attention to the gasoline-producing areas of Burma, and try to acquire the commercially operated oil mining companies. (2) Quickly establish an authoritative organization (i.e., an organization containing conspiracies and destructiveness). (3) Quickly complete the Japanese resettlement plan in the "Qin State" of Burma (located at the junction of northern Burma and Yunnan). This is enough to prove the Japanese's active southern advance policy, trying to carry out various stealthy acts of aggression within Burma. (17th dispatch)

### American Communists Step Up Boycott of Japanese Goods; Far Eastern War is Completely Different from European War

New York - The American Communist Party today ordered American Communists to stop boycotting German goods, but to continue to boycott Japanese goods. According to American Communist Party Secretary-General Foster's explanation of this order today, "The current war is a purely imperialist war. The hope of the workers is nothing more than an early end to the war. Besides this, they have no interest. Moreover, this kind of war is of no help to the workers' claims for peace, democratic legal systems, and socialism. Therefore, workers should not make any distinction between Britain and France and Germany. This is why we should not continue to boycott German goods. As for the situation in Japan, it is completely different. China's current war of resistance is a war to defend its freedom and independence, a war for justice. Therefore, American workers should continue to boycott Japanese goods." (17th United Press dispatch)

### Deadline for German Ship to Stay is Approaching; Tensions Rise in Uruguayan Harbor; British and French Warships Gather Outside the Port for Close Surveillance; Will the German Ship Risk Breaking Out or Will it be Detained?

Uruguayan Capital - The nine hundred officers and men of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee may take a major risk today, attempting to escape, or they will be detained by the Uruguayan authorities until the end of the war before being released. However, British and French warships have been waiting in the harbor. Last night at 7:00, the Admiral Graf Spee was already firing up its engines, causing various sectors here to believe that the ship was ready to leave. The crowds watching on the shore have been dispersed by the police. The time limit set by the Uruguayan government will expire at 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time today (7:00 AM Shanghai time on Monday), but this time has not been officially announced by the authorities. However, the situation in the harbor here and the entry and exit of ships are easily detectable by all parties. United Press reporters have learned that the Admiral Graf Spee's 11-inch gun turret was destroyed in the naval battle and has not yet been repaired. The crew worked very hard last night, repairing the damaged areas, so the atmosphere in the port is very tense. (17th United Press dispatch)

New York - Regarding the incident of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, the New York Times correspondent in the Uruguayan capital reported that the Uruguayan government had notified the German embassy that the ship should leave before 8:00 PM on the 17th of this month, otherwise it would be detained until the end of the war. In addition, according to a report from a Uruguayan coast guard officer, the British 10,000-ton cruiser Cumberland and the 7,000-ton cruiser Achilles are patrolling the nearby waters. The French battleship Dunkerque (26,500 tons), the British battleship HMS Renown (32,000 tons), HMS Barham (31,000 tons), and the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal (25,000 tons) are encircling the outer waters, waiting for the Admiral Graf Spee to sail out. The German crew is currently speeding up repairs. By yesterday afternoon, all the holes had been patched up, and the gunners were busy testing whether the rotation of each gun position was smooth. The two aircraft that had been shot down by the British ships have also been removed. Black smoke is rising from the chimneys, which proves that they have already started the engines. Generally, it is said that the ship may try to break through the blockade line of the British and French warships in the darkness of the night. (17th Havas dispatch)

Uruguayan Capital - People here are still questioning when the 72-hour deadline for the German ship Spee will expire. Many sources say that the deadline will end at 5:30 AM (Shanghai time) on the 18th, while local evening newspapers say that the German ship will leave here before 7:30 AM to avoid being detained. At that time, Uruguay will send the Changdeng ship to observe the situation and report to the government, and then the Uruguayan authorities will decide on the steps to be taken. It is said that the Uruguayan government does not want to detain the ship, and would rather slightly extend the time as much as possible to allow it to sail out, but at the latest it will not exceed Tuesday. If the Spee attempts to break out tomorrow night, it will have the help of the weather, because according to the naval observatory, the weather tomorrow night will have light winds and dense clouds. (17th Reuters dispatch)

New York - The British cruisers HMS Cumberland (9,750 tons) and HMS Achilles (7,030 tons) are now patrolling and monitoring not far from the coast.

(17th Reuters dispatch)

Brazilian Capital - The British battleship HMS Renown and the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal have recently requested permission from the Brazilian government to refuel in Brazilian ports, as they are patrolling the South Atlantic Ocean preparing to intercept the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee.

Uruguayan Capital - Nine British warships, including a 31,000-ton battleship and a submarine, are docked at the mouth of the Plata River, attempting to intercept the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee". (17th Huitong dispatch)

### Diplomatic Activities in the Uruguayan Capital

Uruguayan Capital - After the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took refuge in the port of this capital, when and how it will sail out of the port has become a problem that attracts worldwide attention. German Ambassador to Argentina Diermann flew here yesterday to consult with German Minister to Uruguay Ragman and Italian Minister Berardisi. Minister Ragman visited Foreign Minister Guani afterwards. When he left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he looked worried and refused to speak to the press. According to British Minister Drake, after the ship entered this port, the Uruguayan government appointed a committee to conduct an investigation. The committee submitted its report at 6:00 PM on the 14th of this month. President Galermo Miel immediately ordered that the ship be allowed to stay in the port for 72 hours, which will expire at 6:00 PM today (the 17th). In addition, according to reliable sources, regarding the naval battle between British and German warships in the security zone of the Americas, the US government sent a note to the Uruguayan government, agreeing in principle to negotiate with the UK and Germany. Foreign Minister Guani conducted talks with US Ambassador Wilson and British Minister Drake yesterday, but officials have not disclosed the content of these talks. (17th Havas dispatch)

London - Regarding the battle between three British cruisers and the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" in the waters of Uruguay, South America, the point that diplomatic circles here are most concerned about is the issue of the American continental security zone (the Panama Declaration delineates a 300-mile security zone around the American continent). It is said that the willingness of the American countries to maintain peace in the American continent is understood and respected by the United Kingdom, but in the course of the war, military strategy and operational interests are still the premise, and diplomatic views are secondary. If the American fleets can maintain neutrality in this security zone and make it possible for the belligerent countries to respect it, the United Kingdom has no objection. Otherwise, it will only facilitate German submarines and warships to carry out piratical warfare, which the United Kingdom cannot sit idly by. In short, the United Kingdom has not recognized the security zone and has stated that it reserves all rights. What it recognizes is only the three-mile territorial sea limit. (16th Havas dispatch)

Washington - The Secretary of State issued a statement yesterday regarding the naval battle between the UK and Germany in Uruguayan territorial waters, saying that if the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" engages in another naval battle when leaving Uruguayan seaports, it cannot be regarded as the second naval battle in American territorial waters, but only as a continuation of the first naval battle. Therefore, it does not constitute a second violation of the neutral zone. All parties are currently discussing the reaction of the Pan-American Conference resolution to the naval battle between the UK and Germany at the mouth of the Plata River. Some parties advocate that the signatories of the Panama Declaration should issue a joint protest to the UK and Germany. (17th Huitong dispatch)

Chilean Capital - The German cargo ship Düsseldorf (4,930 tons) was captured by the British cruiser HMS Exeter near Galtala Island in Chile on the 15th of this month. It has been flying the British flag and is being guarded by British sailors. After adding fuel, it will continue to sail. All German crew members have been detained on board. Regarding this matter, the Chilean government has agreed to issue a joint declaration with the US government to explain the position on the issue of belligerent countries fighting in the territorial waters of the American countries, and to take all necessary measures to prevent such violations of the neutrality of the American countries from happening again.

### The German Ship Commander Reports the Course of the Bitter Battle; At a Disadvantage Facing Three Enemies; British Ships are Swift and Brave in Battle

Argentine Capital - Captain Langsdorff of the German pocket battleship Spee reported to the Uruguayan authorities today the course of the battle with the British cruisers, saying that he felt very disadvantaged being attacked by three enemies with only one ship. The swift action of the British cruisers prevented his plan from being implemented, as the depth of the water in the position was insufficient. Fortunately, the guns at the bow of his ship fired a shot, causing the British ship Exeter to be unable to continue fighting and withdraw from the battle circle. Before long, the Achilles rushed towards the shore and fired fiercely, hitting two shots, one destroying the German ship's fire control tower and the other piercing a cabin on the German ship's waterline, causing many casualties. The British ship's gunners fired accurately, so many of the Spee's crew were unable to fight back, with many dead and seriously injured, and many slightly injured. He then decided to use smoke as cover in an attempt to escape, hoping to fight the enemy ships again in a better environment, and it would be great to fight the British ships separately. But this action was quickly seen through by the British ship's commander, so it was unsuccessful. The British commander, with incredible courage, ordered the Achilles and Ajax to approach and attack from both sides. The ships moved nimbly, rushing into the smoke until they were less than a mile from the Spee, attacking from both sides. The Exeter, which had withdrawn from the battle circle, was still in the north, obviously trying to block the Spee's escape route. The Ajax and Achilles continued to press towards the Spee, taking advantage of their speed and agility, while the Exeter often assisted with long-range broadside fire. At this time, he had no choice but to open up the speed to leave the battlefield. Before long, he arrived outside Lobos Island, and the Achilles and Ajax rushed forward to surround and attack again. At this point, the Spee reduced its speed and fired shrapnel to prevent the enemy ships from approaching. (16th Reuters dispatch)

### The British Ship Commander and Captain are Decorated and Promoted

London - The Admiralty recently issued a bulletin stating that the British cruisers HMS Ajax, HMS Achilles, and HMS Exeter fought with the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, and relied on the officers and men to obey orders to achieve success. King George VI greatly appreciated this and awarded medals to Fleet Commander Captain Harwood and the captains of each ship. Captain Harwood was also promoted to Rear Admiral. (16th Havas dispatch)

### German Pocket Battleship Sailor's Honor

Uruguayan Capital - According to reports here, the funeral of the 36 German sailors who died on the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was held here yesterday. There were many mourners, and the captain of the British ship African Shell also participated in the funeral. After the ship was sunk, the sailors on board were rescued by the German ship Spee and released. Therefore, when the captain participated in the ceremony yesterday, he burst into tears, and his sympathy and mourning seemed to have unlimited regret. The Uruguayan newspapers also praised the bravery of the German navy. (17th Huitong dispatch)

### German Speculation: British Ship Losses

Argentine Capital: Two hundred and fifty British doctors and nurses left here last night for the capital of Uruguay, carrying seven carts of medical supplies. It is rumored that they will board a British ship in a certain Uruguayan port and proceed to the Falkland Islands, where many injured sailors from the British warship Exeter are awaiting treatment. (December 17th, Shanghai Tong News Agency dispatch)

Uruguayan Capital: London is maintaining silence regarding the losses suffered by British warships in the Battle of the River Plate, only admitting to slight casualties among the crew of the Achilles. The Diario newspaper reported that the Achilles suffered less damage from the shelling by Admiral Spee's German ships compared to other British warships. The Ajax and Exeter must have suffered significant losses, and the Exeter sent a telegram requesting that 200 hospital beds be prepared in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, but the ship did not sail to that port.

London: The British Admiralty announced last night that the mouths of the Tyne and Tees rivers in Britain are German mine-laying areas. Ships should pay attention and avoid entering these dangerous areas. (December 17th, Reuters dispatch)

### Japanese Ship Sanyo Maru Arrives at British Port

London: The Japanese ship Sanyo Maru has arrived off the British coast. Its cargo reportedly includes German machinery and caustic potash. The ship is currently under inspection in Britain. According to responsible parties, this inspection is being carried out according to normal procedures and is not a "test case." Because Britain and France announced the confiscation of German exports carried on neutral ships on the high seas in retaliation for Germany's unrestricted mine warfare, Tokyo officials hinted that if goods bound for Japan encountered any obstacles, Japan would retaliate. The Sanyo Maru is the first ship to be affected, leading people to call it a "test case." (December 17th, Reuters dispatch)

London: The Japanese ship Sanyo Maru, carrying German potash and other goods, has recently arrived off the British coast. According to Japanese sources, these goods were ordered before Britain and France decided to blockade German exports and should therefore be allowed to pass by Britain and France. However, British inspection authorities are still inspecting it in accordance with existing laws. All neutral countries are paying close attention to this matter, considering it a test by Japan of the British and French blockade of German exports. British officials say that all the terms stipulated in the existing laws should be fully applied to the Japanese ship. (December 17th, Havas dispatch)

### German Planes Reconnoiter Over Britain and France: Ability to Take Photos at High Altitude

Berlin: Local Berlin newspapers recently detailed the circumstances of German reconnaissance planes taking photographs of the French front lines and within Britain. These planes are equipped with special cameras that can take photographs from long distances, avoiding enemy anti-aircraft fire. Two photographs can be taken of the same target, and even in bad weather with fog, the photographs remain clear. Therefore, German planes have taken photographs in the fog without being detected by enemy ground forces. German pilots can continue to fly at high altitude for more than ten hours, and the cameras can take photographs automatically, without supervision. (December 17th, Shanghai Tong News Agency dispatch)

### Western Front Report

Paris: The General Headquarters recently released War Report No. 208, stating: "At 6:15 this morning, an enemy team, under the cover of heavy machine guns from cannons and mortars, attacked our outpost on the east side of the Moselle River. Our troops immediately returned fire, and when the enemy approached, they jumped out and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy soldiers were unable to withstand the attack and retreated, leaving behind many bodies and abandoning a large amount of military equipment. Two of our soldiers were captured, but both have escaped and returned." (December 16th, Havas dispatch)

Berlin: The German High Command issued a war report stating that there were no major battles on the Western Front. German planes conducted reconnaissance flights in the North Sea. Several British bombers repeatedly attempted to attack the islands of Norderney and Sylt last night, but were unsuccessful. Several bombs fell into the sea. According to military experts, although there are no major battles on the Western Front, patrols and assault teams from both sides are still making contact. A German reconnaissance team near Foreach made contact with enemy troops. Although two German soldiers were slightly injured, important information was obtained.

### Germany and Romania Continue Economic Negotiations: Extension of German-Hungarian Trade Agreement

Romanian Capital: Economic negotiations between Germany and Romania have been going on for over a month. The chief German representative returned here yesterday from the Hungarian capital to continue discussions with Romanian authorities. However, according to well-informed sources, new difficulties have arisen, preventing any progress. The German delegation hopes to sign an economic agreement before Christmas, specifying the amount of trade between the two countries for next year, especially the quantity of petroleum and agricultural products purchased by Germany from Romania, the method of payment, and the exchange rate between the Romanian currency and the Mark. (December 17th, Havas dispatch)

Hungarian Capital: German economic representative Klodius, who arrived here on the 14th of this month to conduct business talks with Hungarian authorities, decided yesterday to extend the current trade agreement by two months (the agreement is due to expire on December 31st of this year). It was also decided to convene a joint meeting of the German and Hungarian Economic Committees here on January 2nd of next year to continue discussions. Klodius has also returned to the Romanian capital to conduct economic negotiations with the authorities of that country. (December 17th, Havas dispatch)

### Statistics on Ships Sunk Belonging to Britain and Neutral Countries

Berlin: Germany today published semi-official statistics stating that since the start of the European War, no less than one million tons of goods belonging to Britain, France, and neutral countries have been sunk. In the week from December 8th to 14th alone, at least thirty-two ships belonging to Britain and neutral countries were sunk, with a total displacement of 119,324 tons. Twenty-four of these were British ships, and eight were ships of neutral countries. The above statistics were compiled by collecting British reports published in neutral newspapers. They do not include ships that were sunk without their names being ascertained, or those whose sinking was attributed by British authorities to collisions with other ships or accidents involving rocks. In addition, the British Admiralty admits that the total tonnage of British destroyers lost has reached 4,085 tons. During the first week of this month, the total tonnage of merchant ships belonging to Britain and neutral countries that were sunk was 121,727 tons, so the total tonnage of ships sunk during the second week of this month reached 241,051 tons.

### Large Soviet Reinforcements: Renewed Offensive on the Northern Front: Finnish Anti-Tank Guns Display Their Power: Heavy Losses for Soviet Mechanized Units

Finnish Capital: After receiving large reinforcements, Soviet troops recently launched a third offensive in the north. Finnish troops also used the lull in fighting last night to strengthen their defenses. Government authorities have taken various measures throughout the country to prevent espionage. From yesterday, postal and telegraph communications have been inspected in various places. (December 17th, Havas dispatch)

Norwegian Capital: A reporter for the "Electric News" stationed in Svenvik, Finland (near the Norwegian border) recently wired that Finnish troops are now holding a strong defensive line south of Salmijärvi. The first offensive by the Red Army appears to have been halted. More mechanized units are being transferred south towards Petsamo, along with more than 100 tanks, from near the Norwegian border, in preparation for a second attack. In addition, several Soviet bombers were quite active over Salmijärvi today. (December 17th, Havas dispatch)

Finnish Capital: According to news from northern Finland, fierce fighting continued in northern Finland yesterday. The offensive action by Soviet troops in the Savukoski area has temporarily stalled. Finnish mobile units launched a successful attack on the flanks of Soviet troops. The Finnish troops there are commanded by General Wallenius, one of the most brilliant strategic minds in the Finnish army. General Wallenius happened to be traveling in Germany when the war broke out. Upon hearing the news, he rushed back to take command of military affairs. (December 17th, Shanghai Tong News Agency dispatch)

Danish Capital: General Wallenius, the commander-in-chief of the Finnish army in the north, told a reporter from the Copenhagen "National News" that after fifteen days of war, the Soviet army has not gained any important military locations in the north, and its only economic gain is the Pitsjaland Town northeast of Lake Ladoga, which has a large factory for manufacturing celluloid. The Soviet tactics are only capable of dense attacks, and they do not consider the strategy of advancing. (December 17th, Reuters dispatch)

Finnish Capital: According to reliable sources, since the Soviet army invaded Finland, it has lost as many as 130 tanks in the fighting in the Karelian Isthmus and north of Lake Ladoga. The losses in the Karelian Isthmus are especially heavy, where approximately 1,500 Soviet officers and soldiers have been killed, and 8,500 have been wounded or captured. In the recent battles at Terenttilä, Lommola, and Siskujärvi, the Red Army also lost 15 tanks. The strength of Finnish anti-tank gun fire is evident. These anti-tank guns are positioned very low, barely above the ground, and are always hidden behind huge rocks, which are abundant in Finland and are natural obstacles to tanks, no different from the steel and concrete fortifications on the Franco-German front. Soviet tanks traveling among these huge rocks inevitably slow down, opening up a path forward and using iron ropes attached to the back of the tank to drag down the rocks to facilitate the attack. Finnish gunners then use the rocks as cover, open fire, and every shot hits the target, achieving great results. The construction of the "Mannerheim Line" is due to the Finnish army's ability to use terrain to defeat the many with the few. (December 16th, Havas dispatch)

### Finnish Foreign Minister's Appeal Rejected by the Soviet Union: TASS Indirectly Responded Yesterday: Accuses the Finnish Authorities of Being Tools of Britain and France

Moscow: Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner made a broadcast to the Soviet people yesterday, making a final appeal and expressing willingness to negotiate with the Soviet Union. The Soviet government did not respond, but the official news agency TASS issued a communique indirectly responding, saying that the Soviet Union has signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with the Finnish "People's Government." This shows that this decision is not to wage war against Finland, nor is it detrimental to the Finnish people. It is only because people like Mannerheim (Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army) and Tanner are willing to be tools of Britain and France, wanting to start a war in Northeastern Europe, that the Soviet Union has no choice but to assist the Finnish people in repelling these people. (December 16th, Havas dispatch)

### Soviet-Finnish War Report

Moscow: The Leningrad Military District issued the following war report yesterday: "On December 16th, Soviet troops continued to advance in the Murmansk and Ukhta directions. In other areas, there were only small-scale encounters and patrol contacts. When Finnish soldiers withdrew from Salmijärvi, they burned all the houses belonging to the Finnish people and forced the people to withdraw with the army. The brick houses belonging to the nickel mine company were not burned, but the wealthy families were destroyed and the residents were forced to move." (December 17th, TASS dispatch)

Finnish Capital: The General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops launched a large-scale attack near the Taipale River this morning, using artillery fire as cover and supported by many tanks, but were repelled by our troops. Fifteen of their tanks were destroyed and four were captured. Soviet troops in other locations also attempted to break through our defensive lines, but were unsuccessful. By evening, the enemy had hundreds of deaths. (2) North of Lake Ladoga, Soviet troops continued to attack and were repelled, suffering heavy losses. (3) In the Petsamo area in the north, our troops have retreated towards Salmijärvi. Another unit pursued the enemy and has approached Tuulianjärvi. The fighting there is becoming more intense. Near Suomussalmi, the enemy has been surrounded by our troops and is still fighting fiercely at night. (4) In the naval aspect, Soviet warships were very active today. A Soviet destroyer and several armed motorboats repeatedly bombarded our Aspö Island in the Gulf of Finland. The local battery immediately returned fire, sinking a Soviet motorboat. We suffered no losses. (5) In the air force aspect, Soviet aircraft only conducted reconnaissance flights in various places today. One enemy aircraft soared over the capital and was shot down. Our aircraft also flew to Soviet positions for reconnaissance. (December 16th, Havas dispatch)

### Necessary Conditions for a Just Peace: Former Editor of the London Times, Steele

(London Aviation Correspondence) In the past few months, my views have often differed greatly from those of Prime Minister Chamberlain, and I have publicly criticized and reproached the Prime Minister's policies and actions. Since the outbreak of war, Prime Minister Chamberlain has defined a just peace in the House of Commons, stating that "We are not fighting Germany for any material gain for ourselves, nor do we desire anything that would damage the self-respect of the German people. Our goal is not solely to seek victory, but to lay a solid foundation for a better world order, so that war does not become an inevitable event in every era, that is all." The definition is accurate and cannot be surpassed by anyone.

Originally, war is most likely to arouse bitter passions and thoughts of revenge. Before this Western Front war intensifies, this point should be remembered. Tracing back to the previous European war, if the aggression of Germany and Austria-Hungary could have been stopped at the end of 1914, it would not have been difficult to achieve a just peace. However, the war lasted for more than four years, and vast areas of Europe and most prosperous cities were destroyed by artillery fire, sacrificing countless millions of lives. The resentment and passion aroused at that time can easily be imagined today. When Prime Minister Lloyd George reported the Treaty of Versailles to the House of Commons in the summer of 1919, explaining that this treaty, "although strict, is also fair," in fact, those who had read the various treaties of Versailles criticized them. As for myself, I was in Paris at the time when this treaty was being drafted and immediately publicly pointed out its shortcomings. However, compared to the peace treaties that Germany forced on defeated Russia and Romania, this treaty was indeed worthy of being called "strict but fair." However, the Treaty of Versailles also had its contributions. Eighty million of the one hundred million people in Europe who were ruled by foreign races were liberated as a result. Moreover, its first to twenty-sixth articles are the Covenant of the League of Nations, which aims to correct unfair treatment by peaceful means, and at the same time lays the foundation for a better world order, so that war does not become an inevitable event in every era. This is exactly the same as what Prime Minister Chamberlain is currently seeking. At this moment, we must begin our efforts again to ensure that what failed in the Treaty of Versailles in the past can still succeed in the future. I believe that even if there have been failures in the past, it does not mean that our efforts can never succeed. What one era considers "impossible" often becomes possible in the next era. Let me give a few examples to illustrate this. In my childhood, explorers from various countries repeatedly failed to reach the North Pole. People generally said that the North and South Poles could never be reached by humans. Later, facts proved that this was inaccurate. This is one example. My father once told me that an airplane could never be created. Before long, after the invention of the internal combustion engine, this statement was also proved to be inaccurate. This is another example.

From this perspective, establishing a just and lasting peace, preventing war from ever happening, is the most basic condition for human freedom and survival, and it is also possible. But what are the main conditions for establishing a just peace? First, this war was caused by Germany's invasion of Poland, and the condition of the Armistice of November 11, 1918, that is, the condition accepted by the German Empire at that time, must first be implemented. In other words, "Establish an independent Polish state, including the areas where Poles live, and grant it access to the sea, and its political and economic independence and territorial integrity are guaranteed by international treaties." If this condition is not implemented, it is not a just peace. Second, this war was caused by Hitler's aggression, so to stop illegal acts of aggression and prevent them from happening again, the results of aggression must not be recognized.

For this reason, the Czech Republic must be restored to freedom, and the people of Austria must also be given the right to self-determination, so that they can freely choose their form of government and allies. Otherwise, it cannot be called a just peace. The small countries of Europe are all worried about being invaded by Germany or other countries, and their worries should be dispelled. Fourth, all citizens and races within Germany should be given the opportunity to join European life on an equal footing, so as to establish a strong peace mechanism in Europe, so that those who are willing to be military leaders in the future will no longer have the hope of winning by chance. All of these points are extremely fair. I believe that this is no different from what Prime Minister Chamberlain called "a better world order" and "Germany's place in Europe should not be deprived, on the contrary, what is sought is only that Germany can live in friendship and trust with the countries of Europe."

I have always believed that if we want to establish a better order in the world, we should base it solely on the British unwritten law. This law has been the foundation of peaceful order for centuries. Its main principle is the freedom of the individual, that is, the individual's right to act, should be paralleled by the individual's responsibility for collective justice and peace. Let me give an example to illustrate this. If any British person refuses to assist British officials in cracking down on illegal activities, they have committed a crime. For this reason, there is no possibility of remaining neutral between the law and those who violate it in Britain. The famous British judge, Lord Parker, declared to the House of Lords on March 19, 1918, "If people generally remain neutral towards murderers, murders will inevitably increase. Extending this to war, countries that act neutrally are shirking their responsibility to humanity." These words are true.

In short, peace cannot have a rigid nature, and it cannot be changed by force. What we seek is a just peace, that is, a peace produced by the mutual peace, friendship, and mutual assistance of all free nations. Countries must sacrifice their neutrality and sovereignty to some necessary extent, so that force does not replace justice. All normal demands should be investigated in a fair manner, so as to seek reasonable solutions without resorting to war. If this can be done, a just peace can be established. If not, this war will not achieve its grand goal, and will be no different from the last war, just like explorers who failed to reach the North Pole and had to return empty-handed.

### Finnish President Broadcasts Frequently, Saying: Hoping Member States of the League of Nations Will Provide Effective Assistance

Finnish Capital: President Kallio recently gave a broadcast speech to the nation, stating, "The soldiers of the invading country's army are ordered to attack our country, but they do not know why they are fighting. On the contrary, our soldiers all know that if our national defense line is broken, Bolshevism will spread throughout the country, and our freedom and social order will be destroyed. Our innocence is already known to all, and there is no need to search for evidence to explain it. The League of Nations, composed of forty-nine countries, has already condemned the invading country. The representatives of forty countries attending the League of Nations General Assembly also decided to declare the Soviet Union out of the League, and no country defended it. This situation is gratifying. From now on, we can only await the member states of the League of Nations to take effective measures to resist this invading country. Since the start of the war, we have been deeply grateful to other countries who have expressed sympathy and provided economic assistance to our country. However, in modern warfare, in order to win on the battlefield, it depends on weapons and soldiers. For this reason, we still need to obtain more active assistance. We are fighting for the civilized world, and we believe that civilized countries will not sit idly by and watch us fight alone without providing assistance." (December 17th, Havas dispatch)

### Christmas Banquet Lacks Turkey

AMSTERDAM - This year's Christmas banquet in Britain may lack the traditional turkey. Some people in Britain believe this is due to the war. Last Christmas, Britain purchased a large number of turkeys from Southeastern Europe. Although 150 ships were ordered this year, Yugoslav shipping companies are unwilling to risk transporting the cargo to England and are demanding that Britain send its own ships for transport. The first batch of 30 ships has already arrived in Yugoslavia and is awaiting British ships for loading. However, Britain does not have enough ships available, so there may be a shortage of turkeys for Christmas. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)

### People's Food Regulation Association to Announce Establishment Today; Fundraising and Loan Negotiations Conducted Simultaneously; Ordering Foreign Rice and Implementing Price Stabilization Again; Rice Rush Gradually Subsided Yesterday

After the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association appointed Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiyin, and nine others as committee members to prepare, a reporter from the New Life News Agency met with Li Wenjie, a certified public accountant and preparatory committee member, yesterday. According to him, the association's charter has been drafted, and it is scheduled to hold a meeting at noon today (the 18th) to announce its official establishment. It will also negotiate loans with banks and financial institutions and raise funds to order foreign rice and implement price stabilization. Once the association is established, it will begin registering orders for foreign rice.

New Price Limits Implemented Yesterday

The authorities of the two concessions are very concerned about the people's food supply within the concessions. In addition to setting price limits and cracking down on hoarding and manipulation, they have also reached an agreement with rice industry groups to continue lowering price limits. From December 17th, the maximum price for the best local white rice must not exceed 40 yuan in legal tender per stone, with successive reductions for lower grades. The maximum price for the best "ke-hsien" rice must not exceed 33 yuan per stone, with successive reductions for lower grades. (Each stone is calculated as 160 catties.) Foreign rice is exempt from this regulation due to fluctuations in its source cost, so that it can continue to be imported to alleviate the food shortage when local rice is obstructed. This regulation was announced yesterday at rice shops, tea houses, and markets for implementation.

Market Opening with Sluggish Trading; Rice Shops and Tea Houses; The market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday, but because the rush for rice had not subsided, rice dealers were afraid to make large purchases. Until 11:00 AM, there were no formal transactions. Only some factories commissioned brokers to purchase small amounts of foreign rice from the market to supply meals to their workers, at a price of 34.40 yuan per stone (160 catties). However, disputes arose in the market, such as the failure to deliver goods after a transaction and other issues. The market management committee is not only trying its best to resolve these disputes but is also discussing sound solutions.

Rice Dealers Establish Special Committee

In order to discuss how to cope with the current rice market turmoil, the Shanghai Rice Dealers Association, in addition to sending representatives to visit the authorities to request effective protection for legitimate rice merchants, also convened an extraordinary joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its clubhouse on Shanhaiguan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. All committee members attended. Chairman Lu Wenshao first reported on the visit to the Fu Bureau and expressed the hope that fellow dealers would (1) remain calm and cope with the current rice market and (2) cooperate to maintain the overall food supply. The meeting then began to discuss and resolve the following: (1) Organize a special committee to assist in handling emergency matters. Resolved and passed, appointing Qu Zhenhua, Su Boxun, and Chen Liangqi as ex officio members. (2) Issue a statement to the outside world regarding the industry's position. Resolved and passed. (3) Draft a letter to the authorities to express gratitude. Resolved and passed.

Reiterate Request for Effective Protection

Yesterday, the extraordinary joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Rice Dealers Association resolved to send representatives to visit the authorities again to request effective protection for legitimate rice merchants. Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, and Qu Zhenhua were elected as representatives of all fellow dealers. These three decided to visit Deputy General Manager He of the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the responsible person of the French Concession's Municipal Council at 9:00 AM this morning. It is reported that the purpose of their request, in addition to protecting legitimate rice merchants, also involves other important issues for consultation. The association decided to continue discussing ways to stabilize public sentiment at 3:00 PM this afternoon.

Strict Prevention Curbs Rice Rush

After the Bean and Rice Trade Association and the Rice Dealers Association appointed committee members to separately request the authorities of the two concessions to effectively protect legitimate rice merchants, the French Concession's police authorities dispatched a large number of armored vehicles, motorcycles, and helmeted constables yesterday morning to patrol the entrances of various rice shops to prevent rice grabbing incidents. A large number of security vehicles from the Public Concession were also deployed on alert. Therefore, the rice rush gradually subsided throughout the day yesterday. Only Ren Tai Gong South Store at No. 628 Weihaiwei Road had 28 bags of white rice snatched at 1:00 PM yesterday. It is expected that the rice market will gradually stabilize thereafter. Yesterday, all rice shops in the city closed their doors, opening only a small window for citizens to purchase rice, to prevent rice grabbing incidents from occurring.

Notice Regarding Advance Payment for Market Certificates and Photos

The Rice Market Management Committee issued the following announcement yesterday morning regarding the market entry permits for fellow dealers next year: "The current market entry permits for this city will expire this winter. A previous notice was issued regarding the advance submission of photos for the 1929 entry permits. All fellow dealers and brokers who have not submitted or have not submitted complete photos must submit four photos per person, with names indicated, to the committee before the 31st of this month."

### British Ship Sinks After Hitting Mine; Captain's Negligence Caused the Disaster; Failed to Accurately Recognize the Location of the Mines; Singapore Maritime Court Sentences to Suspension for One Year; Aw Boon-Haw Subsidizes Chinese Passengers

The British mail ship "Sedana," weighing 7,745 tons, departed from Singapore for Hong Kong at approximately 9:00 AM on November 13th. Shortly after leaving the port, it accidentally struck a mine, causing the ship to sink completely within 15 minutes. Eleven Asian passengers on deck, mostly children, died on the spot, and nine others went missing. The ship carried 170 Chinese who were expelled from the local area and confined to the deck. Fortunately, they were rescued and escaped. This disaster was caused by the negligence of the captain and first mate, who should be condemned and punished. The details are as follows:

Captain Punished After Investigation

(1) After the ship sank, the Singapore authorities formed a maritime court to thoroughly investigate the cause of the accident and conducted six hearings. The investigation concluded on the afternoon of November 23rd. The judgment, thousands of words long, stated that the Sedana was carrying 450 to 460 passengers and 165 crew members. The disaster resulted in the deaths of at least six people, with several others missing and their whereabouts unknown. The cause of the disaster was the captain's negligence in failing to accurately recognize the location of the mines. The captain's license must be suspended for one year, and the first mate should be censured. To prevent similar tragedies from recurring, it is recommended that (a) all captains must personally go to the ship inspection bureau to obtain a clearance certificate and the most recently published Notice to Mariners, and (b) the artillery officers should consider firing warning shots when ships enter a minefield without other means of notification.

Request Assistance and Negotiate Compensation

(2) After the ship sank, rumors spread in Singapore that it was sunk by a German submarine. Military authorities broadcast denials to dispel the rumors. (3) Although the more than 200 Chinese passengers on the ship survived, they suffered heavy losses. Some have received assistance from Aw Boon-Haw of ten yuan per person and a subsidy of fifteen yuan from the shipping company, which is insufficient to cover their needs. They jointly wrote a letter to Consul-General Gao Lingbai in Singapore, requesting assistance and negotiating compensation. Gao, upon returning from an inspection tour, was very concerned and negotiated with the shipping company on their behalf. The shipping company has not yet responded because it has not received instructions from its head office.

### Christmas Festivities, Don't Forget Disaster Relief; Frugality Movement Urges All Sectors to Cut Entertainment Expenses to Aid Refugees

As the Western Christmas holiday approaches, various dance halls in Shanghai are taking advantage of the opportunity to decorate with Christmas scenes and prepare to operate all night. The city's Thrift Movement Committee believes that during this time of war, excessive celebration is inappropriate, and that funds spent on festive dancing should be used to aid fellow countrymen in distress. Yesterday, the committee issued an appeal to the citizens of all circles, stating that since the Japanese fascist warlords launched their invasion of China, creating an unprecedented and tragic war in Chinese history, more than two years have passed. People in the war zone are

wandering and displaced, without homes to return to. Countless compatriots are suffering from devastation, crying out in anguish. Millions of brave soldiers are enduring cold and hunger, braving gunfire and shelling, and sacrificing their lives to defend their homeland. In such an epoch-making and sacred war of resistance, to speak frankly and honestly, the heavens have given us, those who reside in Shanghai, an extremely favorable situation. Although Shanghai, after becoming an isolated island, faces a relatively harsh environment and an unusually stifling atmosphere, we have

opportunities to enjoy ourselves to the fullest. The lives of ordinary people have even surpassed the pre-war state. The abnormal development of entertainment venues and the extraordinary prosperity of dance halls and theaters would surely cause those who have just arrived on the isolated island from the mainland to feel astonished and to express a sense of paradise and hell. Now, the gentlemen and ladies on the isolated island are about to celebrate the joyous Christmas holiday. As Santa Claus strokes his beard and smiles, and as the music plays, a segment of the fortunate people in Shanghai will be

indulging in extravagance. However, we hope that the gentlemen and ladies who are preparing to celebrate will also look at another corner of Shanghai, where tens of thousands of homeless refugees are stranded. They are cold and unclothed, hungry and without food, with pitiful expressions on their faces, eagerly awaiting our rescue. At the same time, with the rapid rise in prices, countless coolies and common people are suffering from the hardship of life and are

crying out in anguish. The entire society is exposing an undeniable crisis. Can we still bear to dance on the edge of a knife? As the saying goes, "Compassion is in everyone's heart." After we are well-fed and clothed, we should save a portion of unnecessary entertainment expenses to help those poor people. This not only expresses our charitable intentions but also indicates that we are not forgetting the national crisis while enjoying ourselves. Gentlemen and ladies, disaster relief is everyone's responsibility. We hope that everyone will rise up together.

### Integrity Movement Urges Women's Circles to Cultivate Self-Improvement, Practice Frugality, Uphold Integrity, and Strive for a Bright Future

The Integrity Movement initiated by all circles in this city is aimed at cultivating moral integrity and saving people's hearts. Since its expanded promotion began on the 12th, daily propaganda and exhortations to all sectors have been quite moving. Today is the seventh day of the movement. The association has written a special appeal to women, stating in brief that resisting aggression and building the nation, and liberating the people, are

the common responsibility of both men and women. In recent years, social morality has declined, and the atmosphere in Shanghai is particularly extravagant. Apart from a segment of lower-class commoners and working women who are still able to be frugal and self-disciplined, most middle- and upper-class women are all painting their faces and indulging in idleness, or rushing to singing venues and sinking into gambling dens, wasting their youth and living a promiscuous life. Those who do so are truly

abandoning themselves. It must be known that women's liberation is the liberation in politics, economics, and education. It is definitely not liberating in name but degenerating in reality. Furthermore, if our country is forever in a colonial position, in a semi-feudal and semi-slave society, there will be no

genuine liberation to speak of. In particular, there is no way to obtain equal happiness in the workplace. Although the isolated island has a special environment and cannot carry out the work of saving the country, if one can cultivate self-improvement and practice frugality, or serve in social welfare undertakings, it is not without benefit to the country. Otherwise, one is merely a parasite of society, and even

corroding society, its impact on the entire country and nation is extremely harmful. In short, under the current circumstances, we should invigorate our spirits, uphold integrity, in order to strive for a bright future. Even women cannot shirk their responsibility. As the poem says, "Its ruin, its ruin, is tied to a clump of mulberry trees." It is hoped that this saying will be pondered repeatedly.

### Nanyang Overseas Chinese Raise Funds for Refugees in the Motherland; More Than Six Million in September; Donations from Annam Already Restricted

The refugee relief work has been

### All Circles Prepare to Commemorate Ma Xiangbo; To Be Held on the 27th of Next Month

The preparatory committee for the Shanghai All Circles Commemoration of Mr. Ma Xiangbo held its second preparatory meeting of the presidium at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss actively carrying out preparations. Chairman Wu Yunzhai made the following resolutions: (1) Elect Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jiyin, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Qiufan, and Jiang Kesheng as standing chairmen of the presidium. (2) The organization's articles of association for the preparatory committee were ratified and passed. (3) The date of the memorial service was approved and extended to January 27th next year. (4) The list of directors of each group was approved. (5) The budget for the conference expenses was approved, with the principle of thrift. (6) The resolutions of the general affairs meeting were ratified. Regarding the location of the memorial service, it is rumored that it will be held at the Hubei Society on Guizhou Road, and negotiations are underway. Since the preparatory committee sent letters to various organizations to participate, various public organizations have been enthusiastically registering at the committee's office at No. 519 Pudong Fellow Association Building on Route Cardinal Foch. All circles, whether organizations or individuals, can participate voluntarily.

### Malaya Promulgates New Order; Emphasizing Control of Foreign Trade; Domestic Goods Sold to the South Suffer a Severe Blow; Singapore Overseas Chinese Businessmen Appeal for Ways to Improve

Since the sudden outbreak of war in Europe, various territories in Nanyang have successively controlled foreign trade. British Malaya has the largest number of overseas Chinese and the most prosperous sales of domestic products. However, since the local government restricted imports, domestic manufacturers have suffered a severe blow. On the 18th of last month, the government of the Straits Settlements in the local area issued a new order, emphasizing the control of foreign goods. A total of 236 types of goods were listed as completely prohibited from import, including

biscuits, candies, electrical appliances, cotton fabrics, clothing, soft goods, shirts, disinfectant, soap, stationery, rubber shoes, rubber products, tooth powder, toothpaste, and sports goods related to domestic products in our country. In addition, 76 items were restricted from import, including fresh fruits, dried fruits, pickles, shallots, garlic, wine, tobacco, medicine, and printed materials related to domestic products. Although the local government authorities announced the above goods that were completely prohibited and restricted from import, they stated that business could continue as usual if merchants applied to the trade control officer and obtained approval. However, overseas Chinese merchants who operate domestic goods have felt a severe threat. On the 20th of last month, the committee members of the Singapore Xiangshan, Jin Guo, and Jiangyuan Associations held an emergency meeting. As a result of the meeting, they decided to send five representatives, including Li Bingheng, to inquire about the truth from the trade control officer in detail. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, they went together to visit the trade control officer.

clearly announced that the purpose of controlling imports was to promote the prosperity of local industry and commerce, so the government would absolutely protect legitimate business operations. For items prohibited from import, merchants can still request import when needed, and the government will designate the market for procurement. At the same time, the government intends to set up a department specifically to procure the goods needed locally to ensure that local goods are not lacking. Judging from this, the authorities' purpose of tightening control over foreign trade is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating profits, but the business operations of legitimate merchants are affected as a result. It is reported that more than half of domestic manufacturers who went to request import were rejected. Various overseas Chinese businessmen are appealing for improvement. The blow to domestic goods sold to the south is evident here. It is reported that the monthly sales of domestic products to Malaya are about 5 to 6 million yuan in national currency, and the annual sales are 60 to 70 million yuan.

### Shanghai West Guerrillas Sweep Up Puppet Troops; Qibao Puppet Troops Disarmed; Qingpu Attacked Once

The Chinese military authorities recently ordered the ×th Detachment of the Songhu Guerrilla Force, commanded by Gu Fusheng, to proceed to the Qinghu Highway. They repeatedly attacked the Japanese army and swept up puppet troops. According to merchants and civilians traveling on the Qinghu Highway, the large detachment of puppet troops under Lou A'yi stationed in Qibao Town in western Shanghai was causing disturbances in the vicinity. Recently, after Gu's troops resolved and disarmed the puppet troops of Jin Fenghao in Songze Village, a stronghold of puppet troops on the Qinghu Highway, they continued to advance towards the suburbs of Shanghai. Yesterday, they advanced to encircle and suppress the puppet troops in Qibao. The puppet troops were unable to resist and were defeated immediately. More than ten puppet troops were captured, and weapons such as rifles and machine guns were seized. As a result, the puppet troops in the town have scattered and collapsed. The puppet troops in Hongqiao and Caohejing have become very panicked. The puppet troops at the Yongfeng Rice Mill in the south gate of Qingpu were also attacked by Gu Fusheng's troops. Dozens of puppet troops were killed in this battle.

### Crochet Gloves Sell Well Overseas; Annual Sales Overseas Exceed Ten Million Yuan; Currently 40,000 to 50,000 Female Workers

After the war in Shanghai, due to the sharp increase in population, small-scale handicrafts have all developed abnormally. However, most of the products of these small-scale handicrafts are only sold in the local market. The only one that has a place in the export products in the history of trade is the crochet glove industry. These gloves are completely handmade by female workers. The number sold to various countries in Europe and the Americas each year amounts to more than ten million yuan. The crochet glove industry in Shanghai started in 1928 and has a very short history. Before last year, orders from various countries to Shanghai were frequent, and the industry gradually prospered. As a result, the number of crochet glove factories in Shanghai has increased to more than 100, shipping goods overseas and recovering many interests. According to statistics, the total number of female workers who make a living from this is now 40,000 to 50,000. Recently, rural women in the suburbs have mostly used this as a side business during their spare time from farming. Therefore, this business may develop further in the near future and occupy an important position in the history of international trade.

### Post Office Resumes Parcel Service to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; Service to Jiangxi and Hunan Temporarily Suspended

The Postal Administration announced: "All parcels destined for various parts of southern Anhui that were temporarily under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province can now be resumed (except for 15 districts such as Datong). In addition, all parcels destined for various parts of Zhejiang Province north of the Zhegan Railway (except for Fuyang, Yuhang, and all areas north of them) can also be resumed." All parcels to Hunan and Jiangxi will be temporarily suspended.

### National Construction Savings Bonds Issued; Not Yet Available for Sale; Can Be Purchased by Mail; High Interest Rates and Extremely Convenient Use

Due to local circumstances, the National Construction Savings Bonds are not yet available for sale in Shanghai. Post offices in non-guerrilla areas of Zhejiang Province will begin selling both A and B types on December 16. Local banks have also agreed to act as agents for issuing the bonds. It is reported that there are two convenient ways to purchase the bonds: (1) Bonds purchased in one area (A) within Zhejiang Province can be cashed in another area (B) without any remittance fees. (2) Areas outside the province or in guerrilla areas where savings bonds are not yet available can request two application forms from the local postal administration, send them along with the remittance, and the administration will send the savings bonds. (3) If you are purchasing A-type savings bonds and cannot personally go to the bureau to affix your signature and seal on the stub and its voucher, you can request an application form from the various departments and bureaus and proceed accordingly.

Issuance Method

There are two types, A and B. Type A bonds are registered and can be reported lost to the post office and reissued, but they cannot be transferred or gifted. Type B bonds are unregistered, cannot be reported lost, and can be freely transferred or gifted. Savings bonds are divided into six denominations: 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. Type A bonds will receive interest and dividends in addition to the face value upon maturity. Type B bonds are purchased according to the purchase price list and will be redeemed at the face value upon maturity. Interest is calculated compoundly every six months, based on the length of the storage period. Type A bonds pay interest at a rate of 6% to 7%, plus a bonus of 5 fen or 1 jiao per yuan. Type B bonds pay interest at a rate of 7% to 8.5%.

Purchase Procedures

When purchasing A-type bonds for the first time, after filling out the purchase application and leaving a stamped seal or signature, there is no need to fill it out again when continuing to purchase at the same post office. The purchase of B-type bonds is even simpler, only requiring the amount of purchase and the number of years of storage. There are also methods for purchasing savings bonds by mail and using postal savings stamps. For redemption, A-type bonds can be redeemed at more than 1,000 post offices nationwide after six months, and B-type bonds can be redeemed after maturity. Redemption is also possible at the original selling bureau or its management bureau. Within the same postal district, all post offices are exempt from remittance fees.

### Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, Inspection of the First Hospital: A Hospital Entirely Dedicated to Serving Refugees, Also Accepting and Treating Impoverished Civilians

— Gan

At the corner of Yuqiaqing Road facing north, and North Xizang Road and Qipu Road, stands a four-story building, the former site of the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital before the war. Situated on the edge of the Suzhou Creek area of the concession, the west side of the road borders the Chinese territory, a desolate scene, far from its former prosperity. The sight stirs contemplation, and one cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy!

This Epidemic Hospital, due to a lack of management after the war, once housed refugees. In the spring of this year, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association borrowed this place to establish the First Hospital, entirely dedicated to serving refugees. As long as they are sick refugees from various shelters or destitute civilians, they can request admission for treatment, and they are discharged after recovery without needing to pay a single penny.

Dr. Jiang Shangfeng, a medical doctor, is the director of this hospital. He is a doctor enthusiastic about relief work. After witnessing the tragic situation of refugees suffering from illnesses without medical care after the "August 13th" incident, he sacrificed a great deal of time and energy to establish several refugee hospitals, saving thousands of sick and suffering compatriots. He continues to use his past experience to manage this hospital for refugees, which can be said to be a great blessing.

This reporter had long heard that this hospital was a haven for poor and sick refugees, so I spent half a day to visit it. I happened to meet Director Jiang Shangfeng, who received me very kindly and led me to visit the various departments of the hospital. As we stepped into the elevator entrance, the director said very seriously: "Excuse me! This elevator and the ambulance outside the door are exclusively for transporting patients and facilitating their ascent and descent. All hospital staff, workers, and visitors are not allowed to use them." With this prohibition, I had to climb the stairs step by step.

The hospital building has four floors. The ground floor is the outpatient department, where patients are very crowded, all of them poor people from the neighborhood, because registration and medication here are completely free. There are also several patients being treated in the emergency room for suicide attempts by poisoning and injuries from vehicle accidents. Other staff members in the registration office, administrative office, materials office, and dispensary are also busy.

The second floor is the male internal medicine ward, the third floor is the surgical ward, and the fourth floor is the maternity ward; there are a total of 250 beds, providing treatment for internal medicine, surgery, venereal diseases, dermatology, and eye, ear, nose, and throat departments. In particular, the equipment in the laboratory and operating room is quite complete. There are eight doctors here, all of whom have academic experience and a spirit of serving refugees. There is also a German doctor who is said to be a famous surgeon from Vienna. The nurses are all top students from various nursing schools, with clean white uniforms and a kind and serious attitude. Just by looking at the neat wards, clean beds, and quiet patients, one can tell that they have received high-level moral and technical training in patient care.

Due to practical needs, a nursing school is attached, with more than 40 students, all of them outstanding young women from among the refugees. They hope to become self-reliant by learning a skill. The principal of this nursing school is Ms. Wu Zheyang, a veteran in the nursing field. She is a devout Christian elder. She not only teaches these poor refugee girls nursing skills but also provides spiritual relief through religion.

The patients in this hospital are all poor refugees and destitute citizens. The causes of their illnesses are mostly due to hunger, cold, and lack of nutrition. In addition to providing treatment with injections and medicine, special dietary nutrition is provided according to each patient's constitution. Especially the dozens of newborns in the maternity ward on the fourth floor, sleeping quietly in their cradles, feel the thoughtfulness of this hospital, allowing these poor refugee mothers to have a safe childbirth.

Since the hospital opened, in less than a year, it has treated 80,000 to 90,000 outpatients and 3,000 to 4,000 hospitalized refugee patients. These figures show the hospital's busyness and importance.

The wheels of the great era have created millions of displaced people, and the high-pressure life has added countless poor people. They have no homes, sleeping on the streets and alleys, relying on their strong bodies to make a living. Sadly, what they earn is not enough to keep their families warm and fed. Once they encounter illness, they truly have no savings, no way to borrow, and their wives and children cry, waiting for death. These poor people in distress, compared to the refugees who have already been taken in, have even less of a basis for survival. Fortunately, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has taken on this relief mission, establishing this hospital, not only relieving sick refugees but also accepting and treating such pitiful poor people, as long as they have proper proof, so that they can regain their health and seek their own livelihood. Such constructive relief work is worthy of sympathy and support from people in society. It is hoped that all sectors will contribute generously so that these people can live in peace and society will be fortunate!

### Hong Kong Financial Meeting Not Confirmed; Rumor of Issuing Gold Bonds Entirely Groundless

According to Continental Press, "China Daily" in Hong Kong reported that Chinese bankers held a meeting in Hong Kong and decided to issue gold bonds for the purpose of purchasing foreign exchange, and would borrow 70 million US dollars from the United States as a reserve. Yesterday (the 16th), major bankers in this city ridiculed this news. It is said that, in view of

the general direction of Chinese currency, this move would be useless. Even today, legal tender can be quickly converted into foreign exchange. The rumor of issuing gold bonds is a new variation on the "responsible sources news" spread by the Japanese this summer. The news spread by the Japanese this summer

claimed that "the Chinese government will recall all legal tender and replace it with two different types of banknotes, one for domestic use and the other for purchasing foreign exchange." The general public is also highly skeptical of the "China Daily" report of a bankers' meeting in Hong Kong, as it is heard that Shanghai banks'

senior personnel did not go south to participate in the so-called meeting, and it is also heard that there were no negotiations between China and the United States on a large loan to fund gold bond reserves.

### Friend Sues Best Friend Case: Sentencing Scheduled

Baichang Firm, No. 353 Jiangxi Road, recently claimed that the box design, trademark, and English name of "Best Friend" skin cream produced by Fubeikang Chemical Industry, No. 33 Peifuli, Lagenal Road, French Concession, were similar to the "Face Friend" cream produced by the firm, considering it a case of insinuation and imitation. Therefore, Yan Bailin, the manager of the firm, and Ren Zhiwei, the sales director, in their capacity as legal representatives, entrusted lawyer Shen Yong to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court against Gu for the crime of hindering agriculture, industry, and commerce. Judge Zhu Chuzhe held a hearing once, and the details have been recorded in previous reports. The case was continued yesterday, and both parties and their lawyers were present. The plaintiff still stated the above process. The defendant Gu Peisun stated that the "Best Friend" skin cream produced by him was submitted to the Trademark Bureau for examination and approval in accordance with the law in 1934. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed an objection with the bureau, which was rejected. Afterwards, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Administrative Court, which was ruled to revoke the original examination and approval of the Trademark Bureau. However, the defendant stopped using it immediately after receiving the judgment. The new "Best Friend" design currently sold on the market has already been registered with the Trademark Bureau. He requested verification, etc. The court reviewed the statements and, as the case was clear, ordered the debate to begin and announced that the sentencing would be scheduled for the 23rd of this month.

### Foreman Hides Wages, Encounters Robbery on the Road, Two Robbers Arrested

Liu Shaokun, a foreman from Hubei, and Peng Qifa, a foreman from Danyang, from the Fuxin Flour Mill at No. 5 Yichang Road, received 2,183 yuan in national currency from the factory to pay the wages of the laborers the other day. When they were walking near Tokyo Road and Haifang Road at noon, they were suddenly stopped by robbers Song Zhigang from Shandong and Li Bugao from Anhui. They brandished handguns, prohibiting any outcry, and as they were about to rob the currency, Liu and Peng shouted for help. A Chinese policeman No. 2926 living at No. 369 Mazaki Road, serving in the General Police Department, heard the alarm and arrived. In a hurry, Song fired a shot at the policeman, missing. The second bullet jammed in the chamber and could not be fired. He was arrested on the spot, and a handgun with six bullets was seized. At that time, three Chinese policemen on duty at Nos. 1563, 2426, and 3337 also arrived to assist in the arrest, while his accomplice Li took the opportunity to escape. Until 4 p.m., the detectives from the Central and Western District found him in the Xinyi Yarn Factory at No. 60 Moganshan Road and took him into the Gordon Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and requested an adjournment. Then, Chinese policeman No. 2926 from the General Police Department explained the process of the defendant Song Zhigang firing a gun to resist arrest at that time. The victims Liu Shaokun and Peng Qifa also testified about the robbery at that time. When questioned, the defendants stammered. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for review.

### Investigation Continues in Xiao Shi Kidnapping Case

Xiao Shi, the owner of Guangya Dyeing and Weaving Factory residing at No. 148 Lane 11 Jiaozhou Road, was kidnapped on the 8th of this month by Chen Xing-sheng, a former cook, in collusion with kidnappers. Two suspects, Wang Jinshan (the lane's watchman) and Chen Fusheng, were arrested afterwards and sent to the First Special Court, where they were ordered to be detained. The case was continued yesterday, and the police requested an extension because the investigation procedures were not completed. Judge Xiao approved the request and rescheduled it for seven days.

### Hong Kong Relief Federation Donates to Comfort the "Lone Army" of the Four Banks: Initial Donation of 2,000 National Currency, Followed by 500 Monthly

Liang Hua-fa, the head of the Shanghai Boy Scout Group of the 176th China Boy Scout Regiment, was previously dispatched to South China to inspect the service situation of the group. After completing the mission, he suggested to the Hong Kong Women's Federation that funds be allocated to comfort the "Lone Army" remaining in Shanghai. The association generously agreed and handed over 6,000 national currency to Group Leader Liang to take to Shanghai and present to Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan, as reported in the newspapers. Group Leader Liang, considering the difficult situation of the "Lone Army", appealed to all sectors of Hong Kong again, and women's leaders in Hong Kong, such as Madam Huang Zhao Ruolan and Miss Shan Dexin, General Secretary of the Young Women's Christian Association, worked enthusiastically to raise funds in Hong Kong. The Joint Committee of Relief and Assistance to Refugees in South China donated 2,000 national currency, which was directly sent to Commander Xie the other day. In addition, starting from next month, 500 yuan will be sent monthly to help with the daily expenses of the "Lone Army". Due to the impact of the European war, this is limited to three months for the time being, from January to March next year. Group Leader Liang recently solicited donations for winter clothing for the boy scouts in this city from the association, and the association also pledged to donate 1,000 national currency. Group Leader Liang took a ship to Hong Kong the other day to thank all sectors and work hard to carry out the winter clothing donation, and plans to stay in Hong Kong for a long time to handle other matters.

### Unclaimed Bodies: Cremation to be Abolished Next Year, Still Transported to Pudong and the Interior for Burial

After water and land transportation between this city, the surrounding villages, and the interior was obstructed, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch in the French Concession, which reported to the police for unclaimed bodies found on the road and abandoned children, was also unable to find a place to bury them due to transportation reasons. Therefore, starting from the late spring of last year, the Health Department of the French Municipal Council chose a site in the wilderness of Hongqiao, West Shanghai, to hold cremations. After a year and a half, the Municipal Council has spent huge sums on purchasing fuel for ignition, such as diesel, gasoline, and oil residue. It is heard that the French Municipal Council and the Health Department, considering that water and land transportation in various places is now smooth and that the cost of cremating bodies is huge, will stop holding cremations at the end of the year. The bodies found on the road and abandoned children in the concession will still be collected by the Tongren Fuyuan Branch and transported to Pudong and the interior for burial, according to the method before the war.

### Public Car Wash Ticket Inspector: Russian Beaten Without Reason, Then Detained, Released After Police Bureau Intervenes: Strong Man Commits Violence, French Legal System in West Shanghai Disregarded

According to the English Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, this (17th) morning at 11:00 a.m., two men in plain clothes, believed to be a certain faction, parked two cars at the bus stop in front of Zhaofeng Park. When Mr. Stupov, a Russian ticket inspector for the bus, saw this, he asked the two men to move the cars out of the station. Unexpectedly, the two men refused and started an argument with Mr. Stupov. Then they called the police to the scene and beat Mr. Stupov, then took him to the General Police Bureau on Avenue Joffre. After the intervention of the Public and Concession Police, Mr. Stupov was released at noon.

### Mao Liying Encoffined Yesterday: More Than 2,000 People Went to Pay Respects: The Ceremony Was Solemn and Sorrowful, with Utmost Honor

Ms. Mao Liying, Chairman of the China Professional Women's Club, was enthusiastic about social work and promoted the women's professional movement. She also held a charity sale this summer to help disaster victims, which aroused the jealousy of villains. She was assassinated on the 12th of this month and died of serious injuries on the 15th. Ms. Mao's relatives and friends and people from all walks of life immediately organized a funeral committee to handle the aftermath. Ms. Mao's remains were encoffined at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. People from all walks of life came to offer condolences in a continuous stream, reaching more than 2,000 people. Their sorrowful mood was unprecedented since the death of Mr. Lu Xun. The details are as follows:

Funeral Hall Arrangement

The hall was arranged with staff guarding the entrance. After signing in, guests could see yellow flowers and black cloth hanging in the four corners of the hall, filled with elegiac couplets from all walks of life, such as "How do you explain 'benevolence and love'? Sacrificing human lives" and "The spirit is immortal". At the entrance of the hall were Ms. Mao's portraits and the blood-stained clothes she wore when she was assassinated. Guests bowed three times to the portraits. Ms. Mao's remains were surrounded by silk bedding, her face lifelike, with white candles burning beside her. There were wreaths all around, and the walls were also filled with elegiac couplets, including "A chorus of weeping" from a group of refugee children, and "Violence and terror cannot destroy the struggle for justice. The blood of the martyrs opens up the path for successors" from the Shanghai Five Friends Industrial School, etc. The white reflections made the scene extremely tragic, and the mournful music echoed throughout the hall. All the guests were moved to tears.

Tributes from All Circles

After Ms. Mao's remains were transported to the International Funeral Home the other day, people from all walks of life went to pay their respects, from morning to night, in an endless stream. Participants included the Refugee Relief Association, the Postal Workers' Union, the four major companies on Nanjing Road, the Jianghai Customs, the insurance industry, the silver and money industry, the Baolong Hospital, all the female staff of other institutions, the Jingwu Athletic Association, the Qianghua Industrial School, the Shanghai Student Association, the Philippine Chinese Christian Association, and other private individuals, totaling more than 2,000 people. At 2:00 p.m., when the encoffinment was held, more than 500 representatives from all walks of life continued to arrive, their emotions solemn and sorrowful.

Encoffinment Ceremony

At 2:00 p.m., the encoffinment ceremony was held. First, a technician from the funeral home changed Ms. Mao's clothes and lifted her into the coffin. Then, Pastor Yao of the Anglican Church presided over the Christian encoffinment ceremony. The guests chanted hymns, and Pastor Yao read a hymn, "Do not be afraid of those who kill your body, but be afraid of those who throw your soul into hell." He said that Ms. Mao had devoted her life to working for mankind, and although her body had passed away, her spirit would never die, so the murderer would never succeed. He prayed for blessings for the remains, and all the guests lined up to bid a final farewell to the remains. Suddenly, mournful music was played, and all the more than 500 guests sobbed and wept, finally crying out loud, the sorrow was unbearable. Several close friends of Ms. Mao fainted from grief. At about 4:00 p.m., all the guests left the meeting with tears in their eyes. It was originally scheduled for Ms. Mao's coffin to be buried this afternoon, but it was heard that it was too late, so it will be temporarily placed in the International Funeral Home for a few days before being buried on another date.

### Manager of South China Automobile Company Accused of Assault

Lu Renqun from Chuansha, an employee of Yangzi Automobile Hardware at No. 393 Fuxu Road, entrusted Zhou Lianze as his lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Lv Yuzhang, the manager of South China Automobile Company at No. 365 on the same road, of assault. It is claimed that the defendant came to the plaintiff's store on the morning of the 3rd of this month to buy a gallon of gasoline. A gallon was immediately drawn from the gas pump. However, the defendant insisted that the gasoline was not a full gallon, and the plaintiff told him that this was a mechanical regulation and there would be no shortage. Helplessly, the defendant was fierce and unreasonable and immediately committed violence, hitting the plaintiff with his fists and feet, causing serious injuries to the plaintiff's left eye and arm. Therefore, he requested that the defendant be punished for the crime he deserved. According to the complaint, Judge Zhu held a hearing yesterday and ordered both parties to try to reconcile outside the court and wait for another hearing on a rescheduled date.

Stealing Vegetables Leads to Death: At about 9:00 p.m. the other night, two people, A and B, went to steal cabbage in a vegetable garden near Zhanghong Road, Hongqiao, West Shanghai. They happened to encounter Japanese soldiers patrolling, who saw shadows in the dark and fired their guns. A and B were shot and killed on the spot. Until yesterday afternoon, no relatives claimed the bodies. Later, the puppet police came and dug a hole to bury them.

Store Owner Kidnapped: Xu Genfu, the 29-year-old owner of Yongtai Rice Store in Tangqiao North, Qibao Town, West Shanghai, from Jiashan, came to Shanghai on business at about 10:00 a.m. the other day.

Mr. Shi Liangcai, the former general manager of this newspaper, highly valued him. Now, at a time of great difficulty, he overworked himself and unfortunately suffered a stroke on the way home from work on the 14th of this month. Despite medical treatment, it was ineffective, and he passed away at Mao time on the morning of the 17th. His colleagues deeply mourn him.

### Jiangxi Road Bridge Reopens

Since the Jiangxi Road Bridge was closed last month due to the tense situation, it has been inconvenient for general travelers and merchants, as they had to enter and exit through the Tianhou Palace Bridge. It is learned that the bridge was reopened the other day (the 16th), so in the future, travelers will no longer need to detour.

### Zhang Daqian Painting Exhibition

Mr. Zhang Daqian is highly skilled in painting and has long been renowned throughout the world. Since he returned to Sichuan last year, people in Shanghai who love his works have been eagerly awaiting his arrival. Mr. Zhang has come to Shanghai for business, and friends have urged him to hold an exhibition. Therefore, he will exhibit his recent works, as well as the works of his female disciple Ms. Wang Zhiyuan and Ms. Yue Mei, the younger sister of his late friend Xie Yucen, a total of more than 80 pieces, for three days from the 18th to the 20th at the Daxin Building. People in the "isolated island" will once again be able to feast their eyes.

### Chen Zhuang Engagement

Chen Qingtao, the son of Chen Weiqing, chairman of the Dental Association of this city, and the daughter of the famous doctor Zhuang De, held an engagement ceremony at the Xinghua Restaurant yesterday. More than 500 famous people from the medical and pharmaceutical circles in this city attended. It is heard that Mr. Chen graduated from the Tokyo Dental School and received a gold medal (according to reports, Mr. Chen is the first Chinese to receive this medal). Miss Zhuang is also a talented student at a dental school. The two can be said to be like-minded.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated that there is a hurricane near the Visayas Islands, moving west-northwest or northwest. The weather in China and the Yellow River area will change from clear to cloudy, with a north wind. The East China Sea is dangerous, with local showers. There is a seasonal monsoon that may turn strong and sharp. The temperature in this city in the 34 hours before 3:00 p.m. yesterday was a maximum of 59.4 and a minimum of 34.5. On the same day last year, the maximum was 60.3 and the minimum was 47.1.

### Letter

To the Editor: I read in your newspaper on the 17th that our company was defrauded by bandits and seven criminals were arrested, but one of them was named Lin Genhe, who had worked for our company for many years, which is very surprising. After investigation, it does not match the facts. When our company was renovated at the end of last year, he painted the facade, seeking to work in our company. Therefore, this special letter is sent to you, and I respectfully request that your newspaper correct the information. Sincerely, Shen Guiji, Shanghai, December 17, 1939

### Suggestions for Eliminating the Shanghai Grain Panic

— Seen Flat

Recently, Shanghai rice prices have suddenly soared due to hoarding and manipulation by a group of unscrupulous merchants. Consequently, other foodstuffs such as wheat, flour, and even soybeans and bean oil have also risen in price. We believe this wave of grain panic is sufficient to threaten all Shanghai citizens (except for the unscrupulous merchants) and engulf all Shanghai's industry and commerce. The magnitude of its danger is as severe as enemy aircraft and cannons. Because grain is the source of human life, a sharp increase in prices will inevitably force all Shanghai workers and ordinary citizens below the middle class, who rely solely on wages, to spend all their income not enough or just enough to buy grain to survive. As a result, all workers employed in industry and commerce, feeling threatened in their livelihood, cannot concentrate on their duties and, due to their living conditions, cannot help but make demands on their employers. Consequently, all industry and commerce will be directly affected first. Ultimately, because the entire income of ordinary citizens is insufficient or only enough to survive, not to mention the inability to maintain public order throughout the city, the purchasing power of all industrial and commercial goods will naturally decline severely. If this continues, all of Shanghai's industry and commerce may simply face total ruin.

Currently, the authorities of the two concessions are indeed making efforts to preside over this matter, wanting to stop this trend. Their main method has been announced in the issued "Notice," namely: instructing the public to report unscrupulous merchants so that they can be punished according to the facts. At the same time, the Rice Market Management Committee and the Soybean and Rice Industry Association have also seriously addressed this matter and have made considerable suggestions. However, we believe these methods all have shortcomings:

First: The method of the concession authorities instructing the public to report unscrupulous merchants will not achieve the originally expected effect because the responsibility of reporting must be borne by private individuals, and the general public will inevitably have a sense of fear. Moreover, because reporting is of a confidential nature, unscrupulous merchants can still engage in secret activities, hoping to evade punishment.

Second: The Rice Market Management Committee and the Soybean and Rice Industry Association have considerable contact with grain merchants on a regular basis, making it difficult to severely deal with unscrupulous merchants due to considerations of personal relations.

Third: The Soybean and Rice Industry Association's proposed methods of unblocking supply sources and ordering foreign rice for price stabilization are indeed fundamental solutions, but without severe punishment for unscrupulous merchants, the results can only provide temporary relief and cannot be sustained permanently.

We believe that to eliminate the grain panic in Shanghai, two principles must be observed:

First: This matter must be handled publicly by civic groups to prevent all secret activities.

Second: All the shady dealings of grain merchants must be exposed and effectively punished.

Based on these two principles, we now put forward a serious proposal: All civic groups in Shanghai, especially the various trade associations affiliated with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as well as the various labor unions and all labor groups, should elect representatives. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce should issue a public announcement, convene a meeting on a specified date, and quickly organize a "Grain Relief Committee." The organization of this committee can be roughly divided into general affairs, investigation, reporting, evaluation, and planning groups, each responsible for various tasks. In terms of tasks, it can be roughly divided into the following items: (1) Periodically investigate the city's grain inventory, sources, procurement prices, sales conditions, and the true facts of hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants; (2) Thoroughly publicize the investigation results at any time, fully disclosing them in various newspapers; (3) Report all unscrupulous merchants at any time based on the investigation results, requesting the concession authorities to investigate and punish them severely; (4) Periodically assess the highest prices of various grains based on the investigation results, suggesting that the concession authorities strictly supervise grain merchants to fulfill their obligations; (5) Discuss and coordinate various practical methods for adjusting grain supply and demand and stabilizing grain prices at any time based on the investigation results, and cooperate with all parties to implement them as soon as possible. In this way, the grain panic in Shanghai can be eliminated in a short time and can be permanently prevented from recurring.

Since the threat of the grain panic is as described above, and the method of eliminating this threat is possible, we believe that Shanghai's industrial and commercial groups, for their own vital interests, will certainly step forward to take on this responsibility. If the concession authorities can get the assistance of such a committee to jointly assume responsibility for eliminating this threat and stabilizing the Shanghai market, they would certainly welcome it and do their best to support it. We sincerely hope that all people in Shanghai will unanimously promote and discuss this proposal at length to facilitate its realization!

Editor's Note: It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and more than thirty other public organizations have decided to organize a Civil Food Adjustment Committee, and it is scheduled to be established today. We wish it success and hope that it will become a permanent organization and effectively assume the responsibility of adjustment. The above suggestions can largely be provided to the committee for reference. However, regarding the investigation results of the inventory, in the editor's private opinion, there is no need to publish them. Because this city is not a rice-producing area and is the largest consumption area; the annual rice demand is often more than six million piculs; and in terms of the existing warehouse capacity, it is believed that since Shanghai opened as a port, the stored rice has never exceeded several million dan. It is not easy to threaten speculation with the amount of inventory, and it may even have the danger of stirring up trouble. Moreover, the adjustment organization should bear two responsibilities: (1) maintaining a fair rice price; (2) maintaining a balance between supply and demand. If the inventory is ample, there is no need to publish it, because it would be enough to slow down the transport of rice from the interior; if the inventory is not abundant, it should be quickly purchased and replenished; if it is disclosed, it would only disturb the people. Therefore, the wartime food control agencies in various countries such as England and Germany, whether in the last European war or in the current war, are only responsible to the people for maintaining rice prices and for maintaining the actual amount needed. Inventory surveys are only provided to these control agencies for internal reference when handling ordering and adjusting transportation and sales.

### Analysis of Japan's Financial Strength (Part Two)

— Excerpted and Translated by Zhu Shihui

In the 1936-37 fiscal year, tax revenue accounted for 48.7% of the Japanese government's revenue, but in the 1939-40 fiscal year, tax revenue accounted for only 26.8%. Furthermore, in the 1936-37 fiscal year, ordinary taxes accounted for 56% of total tax revenue, while in the 1939-40 fiscal year, ordinary taxes accounted for only 29% of total tax revenue. From this analysis, it can be seen that the main source of revenue for the Japanese government has recently shifted from tax revenue to public debt and other loan revenue. If we look at the loan revenue for the 1939-40 fiscal year, it accounted for 64% of total revenue. The figures in the table above are still estimated budget figures. In fact, the actual loan revenue may be even greater than this.

The various types of revenue listed in the table above are only general totals. We must analyze them one by one:

(1) Ordinary Taxes. Ordinary taxes are taxes borne by the general public, including six types: land tax, liquor tax, sugar consumption tax, textile consumption tax, customs duties, and freight and stamp taxes. The amounts of various revenues over the years are shown in the following table:

Observing the various ordinary taxes from the above table, the degree of increase in the recent two years is not very large. As for why customs revenue in ordinary taxes cannot increase, there are two reasons: (1) A strict restriction policy is adopted on the import of non-military goods; (2) The import of military supplies is tax-exempt. The tax rates on sugar and textile consumption taxes have been difficult to increase separately since the outbreak of the war, but comparing the revenue in the 1939-40 fiscal year with the above three fiscal years, the increase is also limited. From this, it can be seen that the tax rates of these two items have reached the point of diminishing returns.

(2) Business Profits Tax and Income Tax. This tax is borne by the wealthier people in society, including three types: (1) Income tax, (2) Enterprise profit tax, (3) Excessive profit tax. There are three types of income tax: The first type of income tax is levied on the income of legal entities. The tax rate for this type of income tax was 5% on the net profit of companies before the war, but it has increased to % after the war; The second type of income tax is levied on the interest of public bonds, other securities, and deposits. Among them, the interest income of national bonds with an annual interest rate of less than 4% is tax-exempt, and the interest income of national bonds with an annual interest rate of more than 4% is levied at a tax rate of 4%, which has now increased to 5%. The interest income of other securities and deposits is levied at a tax rate of 5% to %; The third type of income tax is levied on the personal income. Before the war, personal income was taxed starting from 1,200 yuan per year, but now it has been reduced to 1,000 yuan. The tax rate is not very high. 0.9% is levied on income below 1,200 yuan, 5% is levied on income below 3,000 yuan, 2% is levied on income above 1,500 yuan, 21% is levied on income above 70,000 yuan, 27% is levied on income above 1 million yuan, and 36% is levied on income above 4 million yuan. The various tax rates above have also been increased by 22.5%.

The enterprise profit tax is a tax levied on the net profit of enterprises. A tax of 3.4% is levied on the net profit of companies, and a tax of 2.2% is levied on the net profit of enterprises other than companies. The excessive profit tax is a tax levied on the profits of companies or other enterprises that exceed the average profits of 1934, 1935, and 1936. 30% is levied on companies, and 20% is levied on enterprises other than companies.

If the Japanese government wants to increase its income tax revenue, there are only three possible ways: (1) increasing the income of those who bear the tax; (2) increasing the tax rate; (3) lowering the tax-free limit. Now let us see if these three ways are feasible: First, although the annual income of the Japanese people can be slightly increased, it is absolutely impossible to collect an additional 100 million or 200 million yuan in tax revenue each year. Second, the tax rate can certainly be increased indefinitely, but the result will inevitably shift the funds already invested in national debt and industrial and commercial enterprises, and the domestic industry and commerce will also fall into a state of stagnation, which is tantamount to a suicidal policy. Currently, Japan's income from national debt is 400 million to 500 million yuan per year. If such a huge amount is to be obtained from taxes, it would have to make domestic capitalists unable to operate their enterprises. Third, lowering the tax-free point can certainly increase the number of taxpayers. However, it is doubtful whether this can make a huge increase in tax revenue. Japan very much wants to further reduce the tax-free point of income tax to 800 yuan. Let us analyze it with the income tax of the 1937-38 fiscal year: the tax revenue of taxpayers with an annual income of 1,000 yuan to 1,200 yuan is only 371,554 yuan, and their number only accounts for 12% of all taxpayers. Their total annual income is 33.5 million yuan, which only accounts for 9% of the total income of the Japanese people of 381.9 million yuan. Furthermore, if we calculate it according to the domestic price index, the salary class with an annual income of 600 yuan to 1,000 yuan can only maintain the life of a family of four, and such families certainly cannot bear direct taxes.

(3) Monopoly Bureau Profit Revenue. The items monopolized by Japan include tobacco, camphor, and salt. This type of revenue decreased from more than 258.8 million yuan in the 1937-38 fiscal year to more than 241 million yuan in the 1939-40 fiscal year. From this, it can be seen that it is also quite impossible to increase this type of revenue.

(4) Government Industry and Property Revenue. The revenue of various state-owned enterprises over the years is shown in the following table:

Among the above state-owned enterprise revenues, the revenue from state-owned forest materials has increased the fastest. But this is not a good phenomenon, because this increase indicates that Japan is strictly restricting the import of foreign timber and is trying to exploit domestic forest resources as much as possible. Although the revenue has temporarily increased, the reserves of domestic timber resources are decreasing day by day.

(5) Public Debt and Other Loan Revenue. This revenue is Japan's primary source of finance during the war. In 1937, the Japanese government's borrowing increased by about 150.3 million yuan compared with 1936. If compared with 1936 in 1938, it increased by more than 433.8 million yuan. According to past experience, the Japanese government now intends to borrow 400 million yuan each year to provide for its huge military expenditure.

(6) Miscellaneous Revenue. There are many sources of this type of revenue, but there is no revenue among them that can be increased in the near future.

Based on the various data and analyses given above, we can come to a conclusion: that is, although the scale of Japan's war of aggression on the Chinese battlefield is not very large, it has done its best in planning its financial strength. All kinds of ordinary tax revenue, Monopoly Bureau profit revenue, government industry and property revenue, etc. cannot be increased. This phenomenon can be seen from the decrease in the 1939-40 fiscal year budget numbers compared with the previous year. The reason why the Japanese government can still barely maintain the war in China is entirely due to its public debt policy.

Japan now has three ways to maintain a long-term Sino-Japanese war: First, the army and navy expenditures listed in the first table we gave are not entirely used for the war against China. Part of them are prepared for use when fighting other countries. Now it can take this reserve war expenditure and transfer it to the war expenditure against China, but this amount is at most 100 million to 200 million yuan, because in all its army and navy expenditures, the war expenditure against China is at least 450 million yuan per year. Second, it can force all national savings to be used for subscribing to public bonds, or actively increase tax revenue. Such efforts may enable it to have an additional income of 200 million to 250 million yuan per year, but the domestic enterprises that already exist will inevitably stagnate, not to mention the development of emerging enterprises. Third, try to increase the income of the people, but in the current state of war, the people's military service obligations, the sharp decline in foreign trade, etc., all indicate that this is just an ideal plan. Through the study of the above three methods, we can see that Japan can now increase its revenue by a maximum of 400 million yuan. However, we must pay attention to the fact that after Japan uses this last source of finance as expenditure for the war against China, it will no longer be able to engage in war with other countries.

Japan may have to use its greatest efforts in the future to seize the Chinese resources in the occupied areas. Although this is possible, if it fails even in this effort, then if the Soviet Union, Germany, Britain, or other countries want to wage war against it, it will have to surrender.

### The Past Week

When the new price limit of 40 yuan was announced, the best rice was no more than 43.8 yuan, and although special rice once reached 48 yuan, it immediately softened. Now, special rice is no more than 43 or 4 yuan, and second-grade rice is only more than 34 yuan; the price limit of 45 yuan should certainly be lowered. Therefore, starting yesterday, new price limits of 40 yuan for high-grade rice and 33 yuan for guest Xian rice were announced. Some people say that this change in price limits is following the market price, not leading the market price. We hope that this will not be the case, otherwise, wouldn't we be ridiculous?

Inland Rice Prices and Shanghai. These days, news of soaring inland rice prices is spreading all over the newspapers. Therefore, people in the rice industry are saying, "Since inland rice prices are so expensive, how can Shanghai rice prices be low?" This statement seems to be more logical than the so-called "How much does a bag of foreign rice cost? How can domestic rice be low?" in the past! However, in fact, there should be a distinction between what comes first and what comes later. Moreover, the iron rule in capitalist society is that urban prices lead rural prices. Precisely because Shanghai rice prices are high, so are inland rice prices. The National Government recently prohibited the domestic transfer of goods from the occupied areas, in addition to preventing aiding the enemy, it is also to sever the means of Shanghai prices leading inland prices. Because Shanghai rice prices dominate inland rice prices, Shanghai rice merchants are blindly raising rice prices, which is actually a suicidal policy.

Rice Snatching Frenzy. On the 15th and 16th, there were as many as 54 rice snatching cases, snatching more than 2,000 dan of rice; 112 people were arrested. This terrifying situation should be eliminated as soon as possible; therefore, the concession authorities have long been stepping up security and suppressing it everywhere. However, people in the rice industry do not reflect on themselves, and seem to be shifting their anger to the authorities, claiming that the previous notice had the words "no protection will be given to unscrupulous merchants," and actually "went on strike in disguise" as a threat. However, both striking and snatching rice are illegal acts; moreover, with such good rice prices, the loss of striking is even more incalculable!

Labor Unrest Threat. The direct result of soaring rice prices is the rice snatching frenzy; the indirect result should be the recent wave of labor-management disputes. Forced by livelihood, the labor side settled accounts with the capital side; but under the high rice prices, the capital side is also an oppressed person; who should they settle accounts with? However, this situation cannot be generalized: some labor unrest is due to the fact that the capital side exclusively obtains the huge profits of the "wartime boom" and ignores the livelihood of the labor side. This situation is somewhat similar to the labor unrest that occurred in various industrial and commercial sectors under the "legal tender boom" before the August 13th Incident. However, in today's wartime, the labor and capital sides have equal responsibilities and positions towards the society and the country. Only by understanding and cooperating with each other can they overcome the difficulties together. Moreover, the case of Lun Chang is a lesson from the past. Therefore, some disputes have been satisfactorily resolved under the mediation of the concession authorities. It is hoped that those that have not been resolved can also understand the overall situation and strive to end them!

### Grain: Foreign Rice Arriving Continuously, High-Quality White Rice Falls Below 40 Yuan

The source of rice and grain in the recent past was in such state that after the relevant parties in various regions implemented control and exclusive export, nothing arrived. Yesterday, fortunately, a large amount of foreign rice poured in continuously. As for market transactions, they are still in a state of invisible stagnation. Consequently, guest merchants are scattered, and few come to the market. Moreover, general shops are deeply wary of the rice snatching frenzy, and the market situation has deteriorated. It seems that they are disheartened, lack ambition, and stand idly by. Sellers, guest traders, and hoarders are still desperately trying to sell quickly, but if high-quality white rice has already entered the new limit of 40 yuan, shouting only 38 or 39 yuan, and guest Xian rice shouts about 30 yuan, it is still rare to find a buyer. Therefore, transactions seem to have stopped. Only Shun Tai bought a load of 25 tons of Saigon rice from Suzhou Road, with the price opening at 41.9 yuan per original package (calculated at 1.25 piculs per stone).

The retail price of screened blocks in door shops is 124 yuan, and each item is 15.5 yuan, delivered to customers, including line bar.

### Gender Hygiene: Confirmed Through Animal Testing - How to Treat Debauchery-Induced Kidney Deficiency?

— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Why can't humans live forever? The reason is entirely due to the gradual weakening of the vitality of various glands in the body after prolonged use. If one disregards hygiene and indulges in debauchery, aging will accelerate. Since physiologists and medical scientists discovered that various human glands secrete a fluid internally, they have conducted in-depth research. As a result, it has been proven that this internally secreted substance is the foundation for promoting human health and contributes to the prosperity and metabolism of various parts of the body. The expression of sexual power, the development of brainpower, and the production of blood are all related to it. Experts from various countries, in order to study the method of human longevity, have used scientific advancements to conduct various animal experiments and extract glandular elements from robust animals to supplement the weakened functions of certain human glands, in order to restore their strength. This has been a great success in today's era of scientific and medical advancement in the 20th century. Therefore, doctors from various countries have used it to treat various diseases, which is the so-called endocrine therapy.

Debauched individuals will inevitably suffer from kidney deficiency due to damage to their reproductive glands. The reproductive glands are the source of sexual desire in the human body and the primary organs for producing semen. If these glands can be made particularly healthy, there will be no premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, or seminal emission. Therefore, to treat these diseases, it is impossible to succeed without using endocrine preparations from these reproductive glands.

Currently, endocrine agents abound in the market, but they are mostly weak and harmful stimulants. Recognizing this, the German Farbewerke Hoechst has invented "Hormotone," a pure animal testicular (i.e., reproductive gland) essence supplement, to cure kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, and seminal emission with a single dose. To ensure the accuracy of efficacy and the purity of ingredients, they have partnered with numerous experts and renowned doctors from Europe and the United States to conduct practical experiments. Over 3,420 animal experiments and over 37,000 tests by well-known doctors have been performed. Therefore, the efficacy of "Hormotone" is unmatched by any similar preparation. White mice that had lost their reproductive ability were fed "Hormotone" ground into fine powder and mixed into their feed. In just over a month, their sexual power was restored, demonstrating its efficacy. As for "Hormotone" for women, it is an ovarian endocrine agent that regulates menstruation and fertility, and the drug is also an excellent medicine for treating kidney deficiency in both men and women.

### The Chronicle of Gonorrhea: A Final Stand Against Gonococci

— By Huang Zhongchang, MD, American Medical Doctor of Medicine

The final battle against gonococci has now reached the decisive stage. As a result, the cunning and stubborn gonococci have been conquered by science. We often have a saying, "The small cannot defeat the large." How does this saying apply here? Our answer is that bacteria are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. Our seven-foot human bodies often die from these tiny organisms that can only be seen in their original form with high-powered microscopes. Regarding gonorrhea, countless gonorrhea patients die each year from the venomous claws of these diplococci. The exact cause of these sacrifices has remained unknown due to the lack of scientific advancement.

Now that science has made rapid progress, if we still use the old methods from decades or even decades ago, gonorrhea can never be eradicated from patients' bodies. Based on my many years of experience and verified by my experiments at Washington Hospital in the United States, I have proven that the only way to resolve stubborn leucorrhea is to take the German special medicine "Klinon," which can handle the task effectively. This is because "Klinon" is based on non-specific therapy, made from a mixture of proteo-peptones and yellow pigment. After taking it, it can cause the whole body to produce anti-gonococcal phagocytosis. Whether it is acute leucorrhea in its early stages or various chronic complications, its bactericidal power directly reaches the lesions, regardless of whether the gonococci are on the surface or deep inside. Therefore, after taking it, it initiates anti-gonococcal phagocytosis within three hours, immediately resulting in anti-inflammatory, analgesic, diuretic, and turbidity-clearing effects. Therefore, it can fundamentally cure acute and chronic gonorrhea in a short period of time. As for external medicine, washing the urethra with "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" according to the instructions will be even more effective.

### Case of Lung Disease Cure

— By Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician

Patient: Xu Jinrong, 34 years old, businessman. (Source of illness) Common cold, tracheitis, which did not heal for a long time and turned into pulmonary tuberculosis. (Symptoms) Excessive and sticky phlegm, difficult to cough up, coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, heavy head, worsening day by day, coughing up phlegm especially at midnight, difficulty sleeping, pale complexion, decreased appetite. Last winter, introduced by a relative, he came to me for treatment. (Prescription) I diagnosed that the source of his illness was bronchial asthma, so I instructed him to take a large amount of "Pulmonal" to quickly remove stubborn phlegm and fundamentally cure the chronic cough. At the same time, camphor oil was applied to the chest and he was instructed to purchase and take "Gastro-Tonic Essence" from Chinese and Western pharmacies. After about two weeks of taking the medication, the cough and phlegm disappeared, and his appetite increased. After taking it continuously for four weeks, the old illness was completely gone and his body was strong. The reason why this effect can be achieved is that he received proper care and that "Pulmonal" truly has remarkable efficacy.

### When First Discovering Spermatorrhea, One Should Immediately Investigate the Cause

— By Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Spermatorrhea can be either pathological or physiological. Therefore, when young people first discover spermatorrhea, patients should not be alarmed. Many people without physiological knowledge immediately seek treatment without investigating the cause. Such people are easily misled by quack doctors and waste money. It is important to know that if the patient has no bad habit of masturbation and is otherwise very healthy, then one or two instances of spermatorrhea per month are physiological. However, these erotic dreams easily lead young people into immoral behavior. If their willpower is weak and they do not understand the consequences, they will inevitably engage in masturbation, which may cause the physiological spermatorrhea to become pathological. Over time, the frequency of spermatorrhea increases, and health declines. Some even become addicted to masturbation and are unwilling to quit, forming a persistent habit. To fundamentally cure this type of spermatorrhea, one should first purify the mind and reduce desires, and then take "Nervines Spermatorrhea Pills," a German special medicine for spermatorrhea, to calm the brain and stop seminal emission, which is quite effective. Any severe spermatorrhea or seminal emission can be eradicated by taking it continuously for one month. However, if the constitution is weak, it should be supplemented with "Hormotone" at the same time. Taking both medications together is more reliable than any other treatment. During this winter season, in accordance with the admonition that "winter is suitable for storing essence," people with spermatorrhea and weakened constitution should take this medication promptly.

### Gonorrhea Lecture: Easily Occurring Prostatitis

— Written by Yao Juyan, Physician

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Among the symptoms of gonorrhea, prostatitis is the most likely to erupt. This is because the prostate gland is located at the vital point of the internal reproductive organs. Whenever gonorrhea enters the posterior urethra, prostatitis is almost inevitable. That's why I say prostatitis is the most common symptom for gonorrhea patients. However, most patients often overlook this point, so there is often a danger of infecting their wives. The symptoms are often caused by patients neglecting treatment during acute leucorrhea, which gradually develops into this condition. Generally, the symptoms include prostate enlargement, urethral stricture, prostate leakage, decreased mucus, lack of semen, severe pain during intercourse, premature ejaculation, heightened or sharply reduced sexual desire, spermatorrhea, seminal emission, weak erection, loss of pleasure, and inability to have intercourse, which can become a major cause of sexual neurasthenia of the reproductive organs and also a tragedy of infertility.

To salvage these future consequences of gonorrhea, one must abandon unreasonable treatments and, at the same time, abandon lifestyles that are contrary to health preservation, such as drinking alcohol, traveling, having intercourse, and excessive labor. The treatment is to use the latest German-invented induced static electricity therapy, "Klinon," a sacred cure for gonorrhea. After taking it, it can cause all cells in the body to produce anti-gonococcal phagocytosis for sterilization, anti-inflammation, and diuresis. Also use local electrical massage, Wettere X therapy, etc. in combination, you can quickly eradicate the gonococci on the glands, completely and fundamentally. Generally, acute prostatitis can be cured in two weeks, and chronic prostatitis can be completely cured in three to five weeks. And once cured, it will never recur. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, only 20 patients will be accepted each day, with a consultation fee of 50 cents, and a free copy of a venereal disease book will be given. Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, sexual neurasthenia, etc.

After Luo Douwen's return, Donghua showed signs of revival after defeating East Cellers. Unfortunately, they have suffered defeats in the past two weeks, and their momentum has plummeted. The absence of Dai Linjing, the lack of leadership in the front line, and Cai Shengsen's ejection from the field were important factors in the defeat. The first half ended in a 2-2 draw.

### Overview of This Year's Unified University Entrance Examination (7)

(4) Comparison of the Two Years: Last year's admission standards had both the highest and lowest criteria. One was the total score, which, after adjustment, was above 280 points. The other was above 210 points, but with certain conditions attached. For the standard above 280 points, both Chinese and Foreign Language in the first group had to be non-zero, and both Chinese and Mathematics in the second and third groups had to be non-zero. The standard above 210 points had even more conditions attached. Although this year there is only one standard above 230 points, all three major subjects of Chinese, English, and Mathematics must be non-zero. Although the score standard is lower than last year's highest standard, all major subjects must be non-zero. Compared with last year's lowest standard, it is 20 points higher, but last year's standard of 210 points had more and stricter conditions, so it was not actually low. Therefore, although the admission standards for the two years are different, the degree of strictness is the same. Comparing the number of applicants and admissions, last year there were 11,119 applicants and 5,460 admissions, with an admission percentage of 49.21. Compared with this year's admission percentage of 26.85, last year was 1 in 2, and this year is 1 in 4. In this way, this year is twice as strict as last year. In terms of raising the bar, neither year is very high. The standard of 230 points actually averages only 30+ points per subject. Last year's highest standard averaged just over 40 points. If the passing score is generally set at 60 points, the number of people admitted would be even smaller. According to the initial results of last year's experiment, only a few dozen out of more than 2,000 people could be admitted. This year is no different. The reason is, of course, the instability and anxiety of students during the war, reduced class time, insufficient equipment, and inadequate training. If the admission standards are further raised, it will inevitably result in the majority of young people being unable to go to university. Therefore, in order to maintain the university's standards and ensure that the majority of young people do not lose the opportunity to study, appropriate and reasonable standards are set to achieve the goal of not admitting too many or too few. In fact, this year is already much stricter than last year.

(9) Explanation of Distribution

Distribution is the final process of the unified examination. It is the most important stage and also the most misunderstood. It is necessary to explain this in detail here. The elements of distribution are no more than three points: (1) Preferences, (2) Grades, and (3) Location. The method of distribution prioritizes preferences. Students with the same preferences are compared by grades. The student's first preference is the one they most hope to achieve, regardless of the distance. The purpose of the unified examination is to facilitate students' examination. The school they prefer is not necessarily in this examination area or a nearby area. Therefore, the first preference is the most important basis for distribution. To respect the students' preferences, there should be no geographical restrictions. However, with the same preferences, due to the capacity of each school and department, grades must be compared. The second and third preferences are never the schools or departments that students most want to attend, but rather a fallback plan. If the first preference is full and cannot be distributed, in order to consider the extreme difficulty of transportation during the wartime, it is better to distribute to preferred schools and departments in this examination area or a nearby area, so as to reduce the economic and transportation difficulties for students. If all three preferences are full and cannot be distributed, a suitable school or a department with a similar nature will have to be assigned. Based on the above principles, the following distribution standards are established:

### Ministry of Education: Resolving the Future of University Students - Half of This Year's Graduates Already Have Jobs

Chongqing, 17th - The Ministry of Education believes that the service of graduates from specialized schools and above is crucial to the future of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Therefore, in April, it began to investigate the departments and approximate numbers of this year's graduates from various schools. It also sent letters to central and local agencies asking them to indicate the number of university graduates they could accommodate for internships or services, so as to coordinate the distribution and introduce services. According to the results of the survey, there are a total of 5,276 graduates from specialized schools and above nationwide this year, of which 1,700 have obtained service opportunities through direct introduction by the Ministry of Education. In addition, dozens of outstanding graduates from various schools of liberal arts, law, science, engineering, and education have been selected and assigned to border areas to serve as middle school teachers, with living expenses provided by the Ministry. Furthermore, over 300 graduates from public specialized schools and above in Shanghai this year have been decided by the Ministry to be sent to the rear for service. Graduates from private schools, numbering over 700, who are willing to serve in the rear will also be distributed for work as usual. Travel expenses for these students will be provided by the Ministry. In total, 2,700 graduates from specialized schools and above this year have been coordinated and distributed by the Ministry and have obtained service opportunities, which is more than half of the total number of graduates from various schools this year. As for the number of unemployed students, the Ministry has ordered various schools to investigate in detail and then provide assistance accordingly. The issue of service for university graduates this year is expected to be fully resolved.

### Discussing Rising Oil Prices

— A Peasant

Some time ago, there was a great uproar about rising gasoline prices. Since I am not in the class of people who travel by car, I was not affected in any way. I also rarely take public buses, so I dismissed the gasoline price hike as irrelevant. Perhaps this is somewhat selfish.

I have long suffered from constipation, and taking laxatives has been ineffective. Someone with experience advised me to eat rice mixed with lard every day. Not only would it lubricate the intestinal walls to facilitate bowel movements, but it would also nourish my body and increase my nutrition. So I tried it for a few days, but saw no effect. Suddenly, pork became subject to regulation, and with frequent levies, meat prices soared, let alone the "essence" of oil. Economically, I could no longer afford to eat rice mixed with lard.

Not eating lard will not necessarily cause a sudden loss of health. I should eat more soybean oil. There was a time when I ate boxed meals, and the stir-fried spinach and greens barely had any oil. They were as dry as chewing straw, and to top it off, the rice was coarse. I negotiated with the delivery man, and he gave a very convincing reason: "The boss is trying to make a profit on his investment, and soybean oil is expensive. Sir, the oil content in the boxed meals is about the same."

Since the oil in the boxed meals could not satisfy my low appetite, I had no choice but to adopt the "Western-style stove" principle. Kerosene is also expensive, but I had to bear the pain. In any case, the amount of oil in stir-fried greens had to be doubled, so my lips could be shiny with oil. It was worth the effort. Pan-fried tofu, golden brown on both sides, was a delicacy I could not enjoy in boxed meals. However, good times do not last forever, and like a bolt from the blue...

The price of soybean oil also rose sharply. Usually, filling a glass bottle would only cost about sixty cents, but after the price increase, the oil shop clerk wanted to charge me nearly a dollar. This clearly broke my economic budget again. What could I do? I had to think about "reducing expenses." Originally, I used a whole spoonful, but now I use half a spoonful. Originally, I used half a spoonful, but now a few drops will have to do. The joy of pan-fried tofu was naturally deprived by the high price of oil. According to people in the industry, the price of soybean oil may continue to rise, so we commoners really have no chance with oil.

Shanghainese have a saying when faced with difficulties: "Going out of oil." The prices of fuel and rice are so high, and the price of soybean oil is soaring. Expenses are increasing dramatically, while income remains the same. It really makes everyone "go out of oil." There is another saying: "You can't squeeze oil from a withered sesame seed." Most commoners are like withered sesame seeds. Since there is no oil in their food, how much oil do they have left to be squeezed out? Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel like my "heart is being fried in boiling oil."

### Zhoushan Turkey

— Yangtze River

Christmas is approaching, and gifts are being displayed for sale. In the customs of Europeans and Americans, the Christmas dinner must include "turkey," because it is the only seasonal delicacy.

These "turkeys" for sale are a specialty of my hometown, Zhoushan—the main island of the Zhoushan Archipelago in Zhejiang Province. Every year, more than six thousand pairs are raised. The European and American expatriates living in various parts of our country all use these famous "Zhoushan turkeys" as gifts or delicacies for Christmas.

The breed of turkeys produced in Zhoushan is extremely good, and the deliciousness of the meat is comparable to that of those produced in Europe and America. This is because the Zhoushan turkey breed was left behind by the British troops who occupied Dinghai during the Opium War in the Xianfeng and Daoguang years of the late Qing Dynasty. Later, they were widely bred and reproduced, and now they have become a major secondary product for farmers on Zhoushan Island. Almost every farm family raises one or more pairs of turkeys. Before Christmas, they are shipped to Shanghai for sale. The income from this secondary product is more than 150,000 yuan each year.

Turkey meat is tougher than chicken and extremely dry, which is not to the liking of Chinese people. However, Europeans and Americans say that the taste is far better than that of chicken, so it is no wonder that they consider it a precious delicacy once a year.

Turkeys sold on the market are generally divided into two types: live and dressed (i.e., plucked and cleaned). Live turkeys are worth about fifty yuan per pair (one male and one female). Male turkeys are heavier than females, averaging about fourteen or fifteen pounds. At the same time, the price of male meat is also more expensive than that of female meat. The price of male meat is generally two yuan per pound in national currency, while female meat only costs one yuan and eighty cents, a difference of about ten to nine.

This year, because Zhoushan has fallen, the transportation of turkeys is extremely difficult, so the market price is also higher than before. However, due to the tight foreign exchange situation, American turkeys cost more than six times the price of Zhoushan turkeys, and no one cares about them. Therefore, these famous Zhoushan turkeys are selling particularly well.

### Rambling About Straw Sandals

— Qiulang

Straw sandals, worn by the laboring class in rural areas and small towns for long journeys, are rarely seen in bustling cities (few laborers in Shanghai wear leather shoes). But their function cannot be denied. According to laborers, they are very helpful for "walking," because laborers walk a lot every day. They cannot wear neat shoes and socks, and they need to protect their feet from being injured by broken stones, etc. on the road. Wearing straw sandals is both light and safe. What’s more, they prevent slipping when climbing mountains and crossing ridges. They can truly be called the supreme gift for laborers.

However, it is presumptuous to assume that straw sandals are exclusively for laborers. Some well-to-do travelers, when wading through water and climbing mountains, temporarily borrow them because leather shoes are hard and heavy, and to avoid slipping. In that case, a pair of leather shoes worth tens of dollars is not as good as cheap straw sandals. Straw sandals also have the opportunity to shine, such as in the joint sports meets of schools across the country or the province. In races of several hundred or a thousand yards, the participating athletes also wear them. As for the soldiers in our country who march thousands of miles, they also wear straw sandals. In this sense, straw sandals are enough to be proud of.

Weaving straw sandals is a type of rural handicraft. The manufacturing method is very simple. A short, long bench is used, with a wooden stake installed at the end of the bench, similar to a press bed. The rice straw is slightly moistened with water, placed on the wooden stake, first twisted into a rope, and then woven. It is said that a skilled maker can weave dozens of pairs a day. In this movement of promoting handicrafts, weaving straw sandals also occupies a place, and also provides a considerable supplement to the rural economy.

People who wear straw sandals can walk long distances, but they have no opportunity to step into embroidered chambers. They are only trampled on by people covered in mud and water. I remember that a lyricist wrote a "Partridge Sky" poem for straw sandals, which can be said to be both sad and beautiful. It is copied below to end this article: "Young and green, old and yellow, beaten hard to make a pair. Following the Shu Road like a virtuous wife, wading long distances relying on her husband.

Clouds and rain, borne alone, never has stepped into a fragrant boudoir. The day comes when liver and intestines break, discarding the old and favoring the new, left on the side of the road."

### A Week's Economic Menu

— Ms. Huaying

Since winter began, it has been truly unlucky. It is impossible to eat good greens. After buying two or three pounds and cooking them with a lot of oil, it is still impossible to make them tender and soft. It's as if the hearts of the great have changed, and even the nature of the vegetables has changed. Fortunately, the greens these days have gradually improved. My family has eaten them for two days, and they are tender, soft, and sweet. The heart of the cabbage is especially delicious, so I want to advise everyone to eat more greens. Fortunately, this vegetable is suitable for both meat and vegetarian dishes. If you want to eat it with meat, you can cut pork into chunks and braise it together, or make lion's head meatballs. Even if you don't use pork, beef or lamb will work just as well. Otherwise, it can also be cooked with shrimp and crabs in their shells, which is very delicious. As for vegetarian dishes, if you want to be more refined, you can use only the heart of the cabbage, add a little water chestnut flour, and stir-fry it with domestic shiitake mushrooms and dried bamboo shoots. It can be served at a banquet. For ordinary cooking methods, you can stir-fry it with fried dough sticks, stir-fry it with vermicelli, or stir-fry it with yellow bean sprouts. It is also good with rice. In short, it is best if the greens themselves are good.

### Paper Coal Balls

— Hongliang

The weather is gradually getting colder, and coal is a necessity for the winter. In these times of rising prices, coal is no exception. People with insufficient financial resources will face problems this year to buy coal at more than one hundred yuan per ton. However, there is a coal substitute that has been used for a long time, but not many people know about it - paper coal balls. Let me introduce it. Just put in some effort to tear up unused newspapers or other paper into small pieces and put them into water. After three or four days, the paper will be completely saturated with water and very soft. Then take out the paper, use your hands to squeeze out the water, being careful not to create any cracks that would allow air to enter. Make them into ball shapes, slightly larger than ping pong balls, and then place them in the sunlight or near a fire for three or four days to dry or bake them. Then they can be used as fuel. During the European War, this kind of substitute was used due to fuel shortages. Now is a time when everything should be frugal. This thing can save money, use waste, and does not produce the thick coal gas when burning. We might as well try it!

### The Latest Knitting Techniques: The Braidless Cast-on Method

— Ms. Zhang Liqing

We live in a modern world where everything should suit modern demands. No matter what you wear, eat, live, or do, everything is changing day by day, with great progress.

Take clothing for example! In the past, most of us wore cotton clothes in the winter, but now almost everyone, men, women, children, and the elderly, uses woolen products instead. In particular, woolen sweaters and cardigans are almost a must-have for everyone.

However, these woolen clothes are mostly knitted by women themselves. Although major companies now sell ready-made products, most people still knit them themselves, which is more suitable. However, the knitting methods must keep up with the times, so more and more people have been studying knitting methods in recent years.

I have been studying woolen knitting methods for more than four years. During these four years, in addition to consulting various domestic and foreign knitting magazines, I have repeatedly tested various stitch techniques. I have also discovered many wonderful new patterns and a braidless cast-on method. Apart from being taught for free at the Modern Knitting Club and explained on the radio every morning, not many people know about this cast-on method. Now, I will write the braidless cast-on method below.

Our ordinary cast-on method uses the thumb and index finger of the right hand to tension the wool, and then the required number of stitches is put on the fixed needle (the needle held by the left hand). Then, the live needle (the needle held by the right hand) is used to pierce a stitch (downward) on the fixed needle, wrap a stitch, and then move off a stitch. Continue knitting in this way and a braid pattern appears on the edge. Because this braid pattern lacks elasticity, it does not feel very comfortable when worn. If you want freedom and comfort, you must remove this braid pattern. After removing it, it will not only feel comfortable, but also increase the natural beauty. The method is very simple: first cut a long piece of wool, twice the length of the knitting needle, then put it together with the two knitting needles. Then, wrap the end of the wool you want to knit around the combined needles. If you want to knit one hundred stitches, you only need to wrap it fifty times. After wrapping, remove one of the needles and start knitting. For the first row, use the live needle to diagonally pierce forward towards the front end of the fixed needle, and then rewind it back. After knitting this row, knit a row (upward stitch) for the second row, (downward stitch) for the third row, and for the fourth row, knit one stitch upward for the first stitch, then pick out a stitch downward with the wrapped wool for the second stitch, knit one stitch downward, and then pick out a stitch, knit one stitch downward. After knitting this row, pull out the two-needle-long woolen thread, and the edge with the braid pattern will be gone. Then you can knit whatever pattern you want. The edge knit in this way will have the same elasticity as the other parts. Fellow comrades, you might as well try it!

### A Restless Road

— Aries

The trolley bus number 16 stopped at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road. I got off the bus, intending to visit a friend on Shanhai Pass Road. As I walked into the narrow and dirty Chengdu Road, I saw a large crowd of people surging forward. The black heads undulated like waves, flowing towards the north.

I was surprised: "What happened?" I quickened my pace, walking towards the front. After walking a dozen or twenty steps, the people behind me caught up and rushed forward. "What exactly happened?" My pace became even faster.

But the flow of people became more and more intense. I caught up with the torrent, and I joined the torrent. The people around me were all wearing ragged clothes. From their rapid breathing, I heard their words:

Ah! Is it a rice grab? Are the people around me all going to grab rice? I grabbed a young man wearing a short coat and asked, "Are you going to grab rice?" "No, we're going to watch the rice grab!" he said, panting as he walked. I looked more carefully at the people around me. Although their clothes were very ragged, they were all empty-handed. It seemed that they were really just going to join in the fun.

Looking over the heads of the black-haired people, I saw the shoulder and hat of a patrol officer in a evergreen uniform. The flow of people immediately stopped. Like a fish, I squeezed forward, squeezing to where the patrol officer was standing. It was a rice shop that looked like a soy sauce shop. The door was tightly closed, with only a small square hole open. People were buying rice by leaning over to the small square hole. The patrol officer looked at the crowd with a smile.

An old woman was carrying a small bag of rice. A fat man asked her, "Old woman, how much?" "One yuan!" The fat man reached out to lift the bag of rice, but the old woman held it tightly and refused to let go. The fat man said nonchalantly, "A little over three pounds, right?" "Yes, a little over three pounds. I have a large family, and we'll eat it all in one day!" The old woman said with a mournful face. The fat man waved his fist and said, "Alas, the poor people are suffering! That's why they want to grab rice!"

The flow of people began to surge forward again, turning into Shanhai Pass Road and flowing eastward. There were even more people here. Everyone was saying, "The rice shop in front was robbed! The front..."

The flow of people rushed forward more rapidly. Children were running and jumping, shouting with gleeful joy, "Rice grab! Rice grab!" There were no smiles on people's faces, and they looked at the front seriously. I don't know why, but I felt a twitch throughout my body. This scene was really too moving! The sallow-faced people, with the anger of hunger, had searching lights in their eyes. Although these people were not "going to grab rice, but to "watch the rice grab," I believed that if the door of a rice shop was opened, these people would definitely rush in!

Another rice shop arrived. The iron gate was closed. The shop assistants looked at the crowd on the street with horrified expressions, and the crowd on the street looked at the shop assistants inside the shop. From this mutual gaze, I detected a kind of hostile light. I was truly saddened, "Who made good compatriots become like enemies today?"

As usual, there was a patrol officer standing in front of the rice shop. Some people stood still, whispering, "This is the rice shop that was robbed." "It was robbed once before. Even the clothes chests upstairs were robbed!"

The patrol officer was peacefully trying to disperse the people who had gathered in front of the rice shop. I approached the rice shop and asked the shop assistants, "Were you robbed?" A shop assistant, holding a short stick used for leveling rice, waved it and said to me, "Look, do we have any rice in our shop? No, we don't!" I looked inside the shop, and there really wasn't much rice. But I also understood the shop assistant's intentions.

The flow of people surged towards the east again. I arrived at my friend's house. Standing at the entrance of the alley, I looked at the surging crowd and sighed softly:

"Who made them so panicked?"

### From Skimming Off Ticket Sales to Rising Tram Fares

— Empty As It May Be

Regarding the practice of tram (bus) ticket sellers "skimming off" or cheating, it has long become a commonplace in Shanghai. Passengers know that the fare they pay does not match the ticket, they know that the ticket seller is giving them an old ticket, but they will never say anything, as if acquiescing that "skimming off" is the right of the ticket seller. I have always been very suspicious of this. Why do they do this? Why is there no public outcry?

I don't know how the ticket sellers are treated, but it is always a fact that their skimming off is out of necessity, because if they are caught by the ticket inspectors, they will be fined or fired. Therefore, to eliminate skimming off and cheating, the company should seriously consider the treatment of ticket sellers, especially in this era of expensive rice and firewood.

I recall three years ago, when Dr. Zhu Kezhen, the current president of Zhejiang University, gave a speech at a school in Shanghai, he said: "...If we do not correct the 'skimming off' of ticket sellers now, then 'the wool will come from the sheep,' and we will be the ones who suffer when the company increases ticket prices in the future..."

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council Tramways is about to implement the third price increase. Standing on a socially just footing, we cannot help but express some opinions:

(1) In consideration of the hardships of the working class and small staff, the "third class" carriage should not increase in price.

(2) Police officers must also purchase tickets.

(3) A suggestion box should be set up at famous stations to allow passengers to sanction "skimming off" ticket sellers anytime, anywhere.

(4) Prices should be reduced once foreign exchange is restored.

### After the Rain, Clear Skies

Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and Old Markets, Recounting Marital Plunder and Tracing Old Customs

People did not believe what Jin Danyu said, so she gave more evidence to support it. She said, why do guests throw colorful confetti at the bride and groom after the wedding? You should know that they did not throw confetti before. It was the groom who was thrown at, not the bride, because the groom came to plunder the bride, and the woman's family used defensive methods, throwing shoes, wine bottles, and even injuring the groom. It is said that ten years ago, in conservative European and American villages, there was still the custom of throwing shoes at weddings. Later, it gradually changed to throwing sand. Often when the bride and groom came out of the church, you would throw a handful of sand, and I would throw a handful of sand, scattering it all over the bride and groom's heads and faces. Sometimes it would flow down their necks and backs, making them feel uncomfortable. Later it changed to throwing confetti, which was much easier. Now, even confetti is not thrown. Naturally, this is an unconscious act. Since the revival of China, everything must be based on being realistic. All unconscious acts, all barbaric legacies, must be removed. As for traveling abroad, Jin Danyu approved. She had been back in China for many years and wanted to go abroad again to see what Europe and America were like in recent years. Moreover, she had returned to China in a hurry at that time, and there were many countries she had not been to. Even Lin Jiancheng, when he returned to China, had traveled around Europe and America for a week, but he had only visited a few major cities in each country, lingering for no more than a few days, like a fleeting glance. Moreover, Europe had changed drastically in the past ten years. If the couple traveled abroad again, their knowledge would be greatly improved, not just the sweet happiness of the honeymoon. But her vacation was only one month long, and Lin Jiancheng was responsible for many engineering matters and could not neglect his duties for personal reasons. This matter of traveling abroad could not be accomplished in a hurry. Therefore, Jin Danyu's idea was to rest for a few days during this honeymoon period. Why bother to travel abroad when you can taste the sweetness of conjugal bliss in a gentle embrace? Or invite a few male and female friends to chat, have small tea parties, and eat at small restaurants. Wouldn't that be much more comfortable? Lin Jiancheng did not want to travel in the first place, so he listened entirely to Jin Danyu's wishes. Only Mrs. Suliyya was still a bit conservative, believing that honeymoon travel for newlyweds had been common in Europe and America for a long time. She had also honeymooned with Mr. Suliyya when they got married, and her first visit to China was also on their honeymoon. There was also the fact that the car company they had organized for family travel now had many new cars and wanted them to use them for their honeymoon trip. Truly:

Arranging a golden house to hide beauty, Checking a fragrant car to carry beauty.
