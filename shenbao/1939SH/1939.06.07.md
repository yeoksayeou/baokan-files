### Intercepted by the Chinese Army, the Japanese Army in Qianjiang is Unable to Continue its Westward Advance. A Portion of the Chinese Army Crosses the Han River to Harass the Japanese Rear, the Yellow River Breach Widens, and the Japanese Army on the Longhai Railway is Struck.

Fancheng: After the Japanese army in central Hubei suffered setbacks in its invasion of Suizao, it split up and fled towards Tianmen, Yuekou, Yingcheng, Zaoshi, and Anlu and Yingshan in the lower reaches of the Xiang River. In the Yuekou and Qianjiang areas, they were intercepted by the Chinese army and were unable to continue their offensive. Separately, over ten thousand Japanese troops have recently assembled in Xinyang, seemingly with further intentions. A certain unit of the Chinese army is closely monitoring them, and the Japanese army will definitely not succeed. (6th dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to the Chinese military spokesperson, the Japanese army that crossed the Han River numbered only one thousand. The reason for their success in crossing the river was solely due to the use of poison gas. However, these one thousand Japanese troops have suffered a major blow from the Chinese side and have retreated. It is expected that the Japanese army will not attempt to cross the river again in this manner, as the number of people who crossed was small enough for us to eliminate. If they attempt a large-scale offensive, then the maintenance of their rear lines of communication must be fully undertaken by a sufficient number of troops, but given the current strength of the Japanese army in China, this is simply not possible. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)

(Chongqing) The Japanese army that crossed the Han River and occupied Qianjiang consisted of artillery and infantry units. They have not made any further attempts to advance westward. According to Chinese sources, after the arrival of Chinese reinforcements, they are now counterattacking Qianjiang. Fighting in western Shanxi is reported to have occurred north of Liulin, with the Japanese army advancing north in two routes from Lishi and Zhongyang, aiming to spy on the eastern bank of the Yellow River. (June 6th, Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to the Chinese military spokesperson, the Yellow River has always been a disaster for China, but at present, it has become China's only barrier against Japanese aggression. In June of last year, the Japanese army advanced and stationed troops in Kaifeng, attempting to attack Zhengzhou and strike the rear of Wuhan along the Pinghan railway. Thanks to the breach of the Yellow River at this time, which was 400 meters wide and flooded thousands of acres of land, the Japanese army's plan to attack Wuhan from this direction was completely thwarted. Although they later took the Yangtze River to attack Wuhan, it extended the Japanese offensive by five months. Currently, the Yellow River breach has expanded from 400 meters to 1,000 meters. The water volume can reach up to 15,000 cubic feet at its peak and currently reaches 12,000 cubic feet, making it impossible for the Japanese army to advance west along the Longhai Railway from this direction. According to reports, after Chinese guerrillas attacked Kaifeng in May, the Tsuchihashi Division stationed in Shanxi Province was transferred to Kaifeng. We suspected that they intended to attack Zhengzhou from this direction, but after Xuzhou was attacked by our guerrillas, the Tsuchihashi Division in Kaifeng was immediately transferred back to the rear of Xuzhou. It can be seen that the new Yellow River has again become an obstacle to the Japanese army's advance, and the Japanese army has also fundamentally abandoned its plan to attack Zhengzhou from this direction. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to reliable sources, the Japanese army in Qianjiang is unable to advance due to the extraordinary activity of the Chinese army. A unit of the Chinese army has crossed the eastern bank of the Han River, disrupting the rear of the Japanese army, threatening the withdrawal of the Japanese army west of the Han River. At the same time, the Chinese army is actively counterattacking Qianjiang. It is expected that the final fate of the town will be decided within days. (June 6th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)

### The Japanese Offensive in Western Shanxi Has Been Repelled, and Fierce Fighting is Underway in Zhongyang. The Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Retreats to Xia County.

Xingji: This time, the Japanese army mobilized new and elite forces for a large-scale westward offensive. Their Henan Division Commander was stationed in Fenyang, and the Yamaguchi Brigade Commander also arrived in Lishi to command. The Japanese army on the front line of Liulin suffered heavy losses from the Chinese army and dared not advance further. Therefore, the Japanese army adopted a policy of outflanking and encircling, launching multiple routes from Zhongli to the north and south, attempting to seize the Jikou, Jundu, and Sanjiao crossing points, and then cross the river to invade Shaanxi. After days of fierce fighting by the Chinese army, their momentum has been thwarted. The Japanese army, with a large force advancing westward along the Lishi-Qikou road, was severely attacked by a certain brigade of the Chinese army near Wang Laopo Mountain, and ambushed on both sides of the road by two regiments. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, with 500 to 600 killed or wounded, and fled southeast. The Chinese army is clearing the remaining Japanese troops on Wang Laopo Mountain and continuing to advance southeast in pursuit. A portion of the Japanese army, numbering over 2,000, which advanced westward from Zhongyang, occupied Liudu (west of Zhongyang) on the 2nd, and then split into two groups to attack Liulin to the north. One group of 3,000 men, passing through Shibengtou, Fengjiazhuang, and Fengjia'an (southeast of Liudu), is currently engaged in fierce fighting with a certain division of the Chinese army. Furthermore, a certain division of the Chinese army is currently operating between Sanjiao and Da Wushan, taking advantage of the situation to occupy Qiaojia Mountain and other strongholds near Da Wu. Also, the Chinese army unit is actively operating in the mountains northeast of Lishi, causing great panic among the Japanese army in Lishi. (June 6th dispatch)

Yuanqu: Starting from the 6th, the Japanese army in southern Shanxi launched an offensive against the Chinese army from three routes: Zhangdian, Yuncheng, and Huling. The various units of the Chinese army have advanced separately to meet the enemy. (June 6th dispatch)

Yuanqu: Several thousand Japanese troops, who arrived at Shuitouzhen (north of Anyi) from Beixian on the 3rd, scurried towards Yangcun, Dingcun, and the east of Anyi on the afternoon of the 4th, where they encountered a certain Deng unit of the Chinese army. After a day of intense fighting, the Japanese army, under the pressure of heavy Chinese artillery fire, suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Xia County. Also, on the morning of the 3rd, 2,000 Japanese troops from Anyi scurried through Zhujiazhuang to Shuangmiao and Hanwang. (June 6th dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to news received here, the recent developments in the war situation in western Shanxi are extremely important. After 10,000 Japanese troops crossed the eastern bank of the Yellow River 170 kilometers southwest of Taiyuan, they divided their forces into three routes and attacked Jundu. The first route, the main force of the Japanese army in Shanxi Province, attacked Liulin along the highway from Lishi. The second route advanced from Lishi to Qikou. The third route advanced northwest from Zhongyang. It is said that the fighting in the area has rapidly evolved into a major battle, and the Chinese army has been prepared for it and has been waiting for it for a long time. It is widely believed that a fierce and bloody battle will soon break out in the border area between Shanxi and Shaanxi. (June 6th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Xingji: The Japanese army attacking Liulin on the front lines, numbering about 500, is at Liangjiahui and Kongjiashan (over 20 li east of Liulin), with four cannons attached. The Japanese troops in Xingjiawan and Jiaokou have all increased and are attacking the Chinese side. The Japanese army on the right flank, numbering 400 to 500, is in the Xuejialing and Angou area, 30 li south of Chugou. The Japanese army on the left flank, numbering over 1,500, is迂迥 from Hanjialing (north of Liulin) to the south, attempting to encircle Liulin. The Chinese army is 분路迎系 in progress. (June 6th dispatch)

(Chongqing) The Chinese military spokesperson said that the fighting along the Yellow River in Shanxi and Shaanxi is currently very fierce. It is said that the purpose of the Japanese army is to cross the Yellow River, but the number of new Japanese soldiers arriving in Shanxi Province is only 10,000. After these 10,000 soldiers arrive in Shanxi Province, they are only sufficient to make up for the losses, so there has been no increase in strength in reality. Moreover, since the fall of Wuhan, the Japanese army in Shanxi Province has repeatedly attempted to cross the river, but each attempt has failed. It is expected that this attempt to cross the river will still end in failure. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)

### The Japanese Army that Scurried into Sanjiang Has Been Completely Eliminated, and the Head of the Puppet Army Has Been Executed.

(Hong Kong) After the Jiangmen puppet army's disastrous defeats in its invasion of Sanjiang, Xinhui, and Muzhou, there have been no further offenses in the past two days.

Editorial

### Concessions and War

"Japan's real enemy is not China, but the concessions within China's borders." This is the view of the Japanese newspaper "Miyako Shimbun," as reported by Reuters from Tokyo yesterday. Such remarks can be intuitively judged as emotional outbursts. Since they are based on emotion, they are unlikely to be grounded in reason and can be left aside. However, throughout history, both ancient and modern, Eastern and Western, human events are often driven by emotion and rarely governed by reason. Therefore, in the realm of reason, it is important to skillfully manage one's own emotions and not to disregard the emotions of others. Moreover, Japan's actions towards China are undoubtedly driven by emotion to a great extent. At least, the events such as initiating the conflict at the Lugou Bridge and hastily deploying heavy troops to the Shanhai Pass, and initiating the conflict at the Hongqiao Airport and hastily deploying naval forces to threaten the Wusongkou, made the Sino-Japanese issue unmanageable and led to war, and today is the beginning of the twenty-fourth month. Surely, this is not a rational action, but driven by emotion. Speaking in this way, how dare we belittle the Miyako Shimbun!

Regarding concessions in China, it is not difficult to explain their origins from a historical perspective, their boundaries from a geographical perspective, their nature from a legal perspective, and their system from an administrative perspective. However, discussing their relations, inferring their influence, and analyzing their good, evil, fortune, misfortune, benefits, losses, gains, and losses is extremely complex and subtle. Not only do various contradictions coexist, but they also evolve and change in many contradictory directions. It is not easy to make a concise outline or an accurate concept. Therefore, throughout history, Chinese and foreigners have held various opinions on concessions: some yearn for them, some abhor them; some cherish them, some discard them like worn-out shoes; some believe that they have limitless future, some suspect that they will be destroyed in an instant; some regard them as paradise, the source of all benefits; some regard them as hell, the hiding place of all evils. Because of their multifaceted nature, they have been subject to widely disparate evaluations. This was the case in normal times, but when China and Japan went to war, the contradictions inherent in the nature of the concessions became even more exposed. After the Japanese launched a military invasion of China, they encountered unexpected frustrations in military, economic, and diplomatic aspects. Let alone that they could not resolve this frustration, they could not even answer the causes of this frustration. Instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed heaven and earth, and eventually transferred their anger to the concessions. Thus, they seemed to have found something and said that the enemy was here.

How can the concessions be Japan's enemy? China's material resistance is based on its vast interior, with fields, hills, forests, and minerals. The concessions are as small as bullets, and not worth mentioning. The spirit of China's resistance lies in its resilience, perseverance, and the ability of the military and civilians living in the interior to reproduce. The quality and quantity of those living in the concessions are only one-hundredth of those in the interior. The import of China's weapons has only been possible through the northwest and southwest since the fall of Guangdong, so how can it still rely on the concessions for import and export? China's victory lies in its long history and vast space. The factors for victory and defeat for both sides have nothing to do with the concessions. To put it another way, if today's concessions are controlled by the Chinese, how can they benefit the resistance? If the concessions are controlled by the Japanese, how can they harm the future of China's resistance, or how can they benefit Japan's war effort? Moreover, concessions and war are not only unrelated, but also closely related. The relationship is this: if Japan wins, it will definitely regard the concessions as forbidden fruit; if China wins, the concessions will be unprecedentedly prosperous with the great cause of China's revival. Therefore, to say that the fate of the war depends on the concessions is not reasonable. The fate of the concessions really depends on the final outcome of the war. This is because the concessions are in China and are destined by nature. This kind of close relationship, this kind of inevitable cause and effect, is well known throughout the world. If driven by emotion and attempting to change the fate of the concessions before the war situation determines victory or defeat, it is like pulling up seedlings to help them grow, and is no different from suicide. Why? Preserving the concessions depends on cooperation from all parties, while destroying the concessions can be done by any party. Therefore, we not only advise the Chinese in the concessions to respect themselves, but also want to tell the Japanese not to mistakenly regard the concessions as enemies!

Emotional remarks are irrelevant to reason and useless to reality. However, inciting emotion and leading many people to emotion, even forming emotional actions, is not only irrelevant and useless, but also leads to straying from the right path and inviting one's own troubles. Therefore, if the Chinese side cannot understand that the insignificant concessions have no bearing on the war situation, and cannot respect themselves within the concessions, leading to the destruction of the concessions, then international sympathy for China will undergo an adverse transformation. If the Japanese side regards the concessions as enemies, then the concessions are an international bomb. If Japan detonates it, the Pacific Ocean will boil!

### Japan Demands Extradition of Terrorists, British Consul-General in Tianjin Agrees to Transfer. Instructed by the British Government to Hand Over Some, but Those with No Evidence of Crime are Expelled from the Concession

(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources here today, the British Consul-General rejected the Japanese demand on May 31st for the British Concession authorities to hand over the assassin of Cheng Xigeng, the Tianjin Customs Superintendent, as well as other anti-Japanese terrorists, in the Ameton letter. The British Consul-General's reason was that there was no evidence that the Chinese currently in custody were the main criminals in the assassination of Cheng. After receiving this reply, Japanese officials discussed how to implement the "free action" method outlined in the Ameton letter. According to reports, the Ameton letter demanding the extradition of the murderer was submitted by Tanaka, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, to the British Consul-General in Tianjin on May 31st, and demanded a reply from the British side by no later than July 7th. At the same time, the British Consulate was unwilling to criticize the Japanese note, but said that although the note had a deadline for reply, it could not be regarded as a formal Ameton letter. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)

(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources here, the British Consul-General in Tianjin visited the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin at 3:00 PM today under the orders of his government, indicating that he would hand over the terrorists referred to by the Japanese side. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)

(London) Reuters learned from official sources that the British government has instructed Jameson, the British Consul-General in Tianjin, to hand over two Chinese caught with bombs to the Japanese authorities. Suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the former Tianjin Customs Superintendent, will be expelled from the concession if there is no substantial evidence of their crimes. Therefore, criminals who commit serious crimes in the future will be handed over to the de facto authorities, and those who commit minor crimes will be expelled from the concession. (June 6th, Reuters dispatch)

(London) Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, visited the British Foreign Office again this afternoon to protest the British Concession in Tianjin handing over so-called terrorists to the Japanese. Guo's action was under the instruction of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who is extremely concerned about this issue. (June 6th, Reuters dispatch)

### The Chongqing Newspaper Urgently Hopes for British-Soviet Cooperation

(Chongqing) This morning's editorial in the Chongqing United Daily News, entitled "British-Soviet Cooperation and World Peace," urgently hopes that British and Soviet politicians will abandon unimportant disputes, and believes that British-Soviet cooperation will definitely be realized. There are three reasons: 1. The two governments have the same basic policy on peace; 2. No matter whether Germany's future actions are in the East or in Western Europe, both Britain and the Soviet Union will be affected; 3. If the Soviet Union does not participate, the effectiveness of any peace front will be reduced. Therefore, it is ultimately believed that British-Soviet cooperation will become a reality. (June 6th, Reuters dispatch)

### Economic Assistance to China: Britain Fails to be Thorough, Loan of £3.5 Million, Only £280,000 Used

(London) According to news here today, Britain's recent economic assistance seems to be quite stingy. The total amount of the loan granted by Britain to China was originally £3.5 million, but as of now, China has only spent £288,000 due to the purchase of 300 trucks. As for the US Export-Import Bank's loan of US$25 million to China, most of it has already been used. The reason why China has not been able to fully utilize the British loan is purely because the British side must insist that the loan be guaranteed by the Bank of China when China needs the funds. (May 5th, Associated Press dispatch)

### Japan Again Attempts to Prevent British Ships from Sailing to Hong Kong

Guangzhou: Okazaki, the Japanese Consul-General, formally notified the Reuters correspondent today that the Japanese side had previously agreed in writing for the British ship Foshan to sail to Hong Kong on June 8th, but now it will not allow it to sail out, with the reason that the British authorities do not respect the spirit and wording of the memorandum agreed upon between the British Consul-General and Okazaki. If the British side does not respect the memorandum, the Japanese side will block the British ships in the Pearl River. When the Reuters correspondent asked British Consul-General Blunt about this matter, Blunt only said that he did not believe the words of the Japanese Consul-General at all, and that he had reported everything to the superior British authorities. (June 6th, Reuters dispatch)

### Incident of British Officer Detained: British Ambassador to Japan Lodges Protest, Major Dallamey Has Returned to Beiping, Unable to Meet with Those Detained

(Beiping) According to a statement by the British Ambassador here, the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has protested to the Japanese government regarding the Japanese side detaining two British officers in Zhangjiakou and not allowing investigators sent by the British side in Beiping to see them. One of the British officers currently detained by the Japanese side in Zhangjiakou is Military Attaché Spears, who was detained by the Japanese side on May 26th. The other is translator Cooper, who was detained while visiting. As for Major Dallamey, Commander of the British Army in Tianjin, and Romm, the Chinese Attaché, they have returned to Beiping as they were unable to meet with those detained. According to reports, the two sought to meet with those detained for two days, but were ultimately unable to meet. Not only that, but their request to meet with senior Japanese military officers in the area was also rejected. It is only known that the two detained officers are currently safe and have exchanged notes with each other. The most shocking thing is that the Japanese news agency actually stated that the reason for the detention of the two British officers was that they reported the situation in the Japanese military zone to the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)

(Tokyo) It has been revealed that Lieutenant Colonel Spears, the British military attaché to China, and Lieutenant Colonel Cooper, the British translator, were detained in Zhangjiakou by the Japanese army on suspicion of espionage. According to the Japanese side, the Japanese side had requested that foreigners must first obtain approval before entering the Japanese military zone, but these two officers ignored it.

### Executive Yuan Decision: Partial Reorganization of Hubei Provincial Government, Zhang Nanxian to Succeed as Civil Affairs Director, Huang Zhongxun to Serve Concurrently as Committee Member and Secretary-General

The request was to forward the request for a commendation by explicit order to show encouragement. The decision was to approve it. The Ministry of Education presented a proposal stating that teachers and students of the Si Cun Resistance War School engaged in fierce battles with the puppet regime in the vicinity of ×× in February of this year, some were killed in action, and others broke through the encirclement when their ammunition was exhausted. Historically, whenever foreign tribes invaded China, Confucian scholars rose up to advocate righteousness and died in the line of duty. The school's implementation of resistance war work was truly comparable to historical precedents. The request was to give preferential treatment to the officers and students who were killed or injured. The decision was to forward the request for commendation by explicit order and handle it in accordance with the regulations on rewarding soldiers defending the land. The Ministry of Education and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission jointly presented a request to add (preferential treatment for students from the southwestern border areas) to the regulations on preferential treatment for Mongolian and Tibetan students.

### Anglo-Franco-Soviet Alliance: Key to European Security, British Authorities Determined to Establish It, Germany and Two Small Baltic States to Sign Non-Aggression Pacts Today

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain separately received Foreign Secretary Halifax and Polish Ambassador Raithes today before noon. Halifax also spoke with the Estonian Minister Schmid. All of this is said to be related to the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. According to news received from various European capitals, this agreement must be established regardless, otherwise the crisis of Germany's violent actions towards the city of Danzig will intensify. According to the most reliable information, German Führer Hitler recently summoned General Liedell, Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Forces, and General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, to inquire about Germany's chances of winning if an international war were to occur at this time. The generals stated that the current situation is favorable to Germany if the Soviet Union does not join the war. Furthermore, it is generally believed that Germany intends to resolve the Polish issue within a few months and is currently preparing for it. Everything will still depend on whether Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can conclude an agreement. The British government, aware of this, will naturally strive to find a way to resolve the security issues of the Baltic coastal states without endangering their independence, so that the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement can be concluded as soon as possible. (6th Havas Dispatch)

(London) The U.S. Department of State yesterday instructed its envoys in various countries to schedule their vacations between June and August of this year and to return to their posts by September 1st. It is interpreted here that Britain fears a crisis will occur again this September. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

(Berlin) The non-aggression treaties between Germany and Latvia and Estonia will be signed tomorrow in Berlin. Estonian Foreign Minister Selter and Latvian Foreign Minister Munters will arrive here tomorrow morning and separately sign the treaties with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at noon. The content is exactly the same as the German-Danish treaty. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

### Pope Has No New Suggestions for Various Countries, Nor Has He Expressed Opposition to the Anglo-Franco-Soviet Alliance

Vatican City The Holy See issued a statement last night, denying rumors that the Pope had telegraphed the leaders of various European countries again, but stated that the Pope's diplomatic peace efforts, initiated some time ago, are continuing according to the plan already explained. British newspapers prominently published a telegram yesterday stating that the Pope intends to send another plea for peace to the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and other countries. The Min Sheng Daily and the Daily Mail both stated that the Pope's move is somewhat related to the Anglo-French alliance. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) The claim that the Vatican has made suggestions to the authorities of a certain country has been denied by the Holy See, but it is also admitted that talks are continuing with the authorities of various countries. Diplomatic circles here recently commented that Pope Pius XII's dedication to peace can be seen in his meeting today with the British envoy to the Holy See, Mr. Spahn. It is generally believed that the Pope has not dissuaded the UK from concluding a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, but he hopes to find a practical and feasible way to resolve the issues of Danzig and the Franco-Italian issues peacefully. (5th Havas Dispatch)

(London) Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government had no knowledge of the rumors that Pope Pius XII had protested against the Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance. The various rumors were apparently based on a report in the Daily Mail, which stated that the Pope opposed the Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance for fear of the intrusion of communist forces.

### Sweden and Finland Determined to Maintain Neutrality, Fortifying the Åland Islands Benefits the Soviet Union as Well

Swedish Capital Finnish Minister of Defense Niukkanen arrived here this morning and will hold talks with Swedish Minister of Defense Sköld. He told reporters that Finland is willing to cooperate closely with Sweden militarily and will maintain complete neutrality, avoiding participation in any bloc. As for the issue of fortifying the Åland Islands, this is a matter for Finland. If the Soviet Union wants to know the details of this plan, they can come and ask. "We are prepared to explain that the plan we have devised is to protect the neutral status of the Åland Islands, which is actually beneficial to the Soviet Union," he said. (6th Havas Dispatch)

Finnish Capital A unit of Finnish student soldiers arrived near the Soviet border yesterday, preparing to build fortifications in case of emergency. Since the Åland Islands fortification issue arose, tensions between Finland and the Soviet Union have reached an extreme. It is reported that thousands of these students and young people have decided to work voluntarily for the government this summer to strengthen border defenses. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Soviet Proposals Difficult for Britain to Accept, the Issue of Guaranteeing the Baltic States Requires Careful Consideration and Planning

(London) According to reliable sources today, the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee finds it difficult to accept the recent proposals made by the Soviet Union to Britain. It is reported that the committee opposes the idea that the borders of the Baltic States should be guaranteed by Britain and France. However, authoritative sources believe that rumors of a breakdown in Anglo-Soviet negotiations are exaggerated. However, the signing of a trilateral alliance will be delayed. According to a spokesman for the British government, the British government is unwilling to disregard the independence of other countries and unilaterally assume the obligation of defending them without obtaining the consent of the Baltic States. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)

(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met this morning, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain, to study the Soviet Union's reply on the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and to consider how Britain should respond. No definitive decision was made. According to Soviet sources here, the content of the country's reply is to review the drafts of Britain and France line by line, either accepting them directly or making amendments. The most important of these amendments are three in number: (1) The British and French drafts mentioned the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, so as to establish a connection between the alliance and the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union now suggests amending the clause as follows: "Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, in order to promote the various principles of the League of Nations Covenant and in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant, love and help each other." In that case, Article 16 of the Covenant would not need to be invoked again. (2) The British and French drafts advocated that the signatory countries consult each other. The Soviet Union believes that the consultation method can be maintained when there is no war crisis, but if such a crisis occurs, action should be taken immediately, and the methods of action should be stipulated in advance. (3) The British and French drafts advocated that any country that has not been guaranteed by the signatory countries should be assisted immediately if it is invaded and seeks assistance from one of the signatory countries. The Soviet Union believes that Finland, Latvia, and Estonia should also be guaranteed, and the names of these countries should be included in the Anglo-Franco-Soviet agreement. Sources here familiar with the matter claim that the British cabinet members are willing to find ways to resolve the first two points, but as for the third point, the Baltic coastal states are unwilling to accept the guarantee of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This attitude cannot be ignored, but at the same time, a way must be found to maintain the current state of affairs in this corner of Europe. It is very difficult to consider both aspects carefully. Generally speaking, Britain will first engage in diplomatic talks with the Soviet Union, hoping to find a novel way that all parties concerned can accept in principle, and then formally submit a new proposal to the Soviet Union. (5th Havas Dispatch)

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, a member asked whether Prime Minister Chamberlain had stated in the House of Commons before the Munich Agreement was concluded that it was of great benefit if the responsible authorities of various countries could meet face to face. He asked whether he intended to formally invite the Soviet Union to visit. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that he would consider and implement his remarks from last year at any time depending on the situation. He did not know what benefit there would be from inviting the Soviet Union at this time. Mr. Adams of the opposition party then asked whether there was a barrier between Britain and the Soviet Union and whether Prime Minister Chamberlain's trip to Moscow could remove it. The Prime Minister did not answer. (5th Havas Dispatch)

### Results of the Japanese Five-Minister Conference Lead to Speculation, Konoe Visits Saionji and Kan'in, Observes the Emperor, Japanese Newspapers Advocate Caution

(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun reported that Prince Konoe, President of the Privy Council and Minister without Portfolio, had visited Saionji in Okitsu to report on the domestic and foreign situation over the past year, focusing on the international situation regarding the "China Incident." He returned to Tokyo yesterday from Okitsu. It is said that Saionji seemed very concerned about Japan's basic policy in dealing with the new situation in Europe. His visit to Saionji had no political meaning. Saionji is in good health and is very concerned about the development of the European situation. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

(Tokyo) Chief of the Army General Staff Prince Kan'in yesterday had an audience with the Emperor and reported on various matters under his jurisdiction. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

(Tokyo) The government's policy on dealing with the European situation, decided yesterday, has not yet been officially announced, leading to much speculation. Sources familiar with the matter recalled the statements made by two military leaders to foreign journalists after Japan established the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Italy. Army Minister Itagaki said that the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact is deeply rooted and long-standing. If necessary, the conclusion of a Japanese-German-Italian military alliance is not impossible. Also, former commander of the Korean Army, Xiao, also said that negotiations for a Japanese-German-Italian military alliance are underway, but its success will depend entirely on whether Germany and Italy fully understand their situation in Europe, and Japan's position and true strength in the Far East. In addition, at the last session of the Diet, Navy Minister Yonai replied that the Anti-Comintern Pact is not a military alliance. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

(Tokyo) Only a few newspapers commented this morning on the government's final decision on how to deal with the new situation in Europe. The Chugai Commercial News said that the public was distressed that they knew nothing about the circumstances of yesterday's five-minister conference and the content of its final decision. The government should quickly announce its outline. Although the European situation should receive some attention from Japan, the China Incident is a more important issue. The Kokumin Shimbun said that since the European situation is related to the Far Eastern situation, it is important to Japan, but the government should not focus too much on the European situation, lest it hinder the resolution of the China Incident. The government should maintain a passive attitude, wait and see the development of the European situation, and not take bold steps to strengthen relations with Germany and Italy. The Japan Wide Intelligence News said that Kida, former Japanese ambassador to Germany, recently advocated that Japan should quickly conclude a large-scale military alliance with Germany and Italy. Although the government has not officially opposed this alliance, Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita have repeatedly made public statements containing disapproval of Japan being subject to a restriction that would require it to fight against Britain, France, and the Soviet Union according to the wishes of other countries, and thus be unable to concentrate on creating a new order in East Asia. Prime Minister Hiranuma recently told Japanese journalists that some politicians advocate adopting extreme methods to deal with the European situation, but such methods are fraught with danger. Japan must proceed gradually and steadily to fulfill its mission. He does not care if he is blamed for this policy. If we cannot achieve this ourselves, posterity will continue to do so. For the sake of world peace, Japan will maintain closer ties with Germany and Italy. From Hiranuma's words, the ties between Germany, Italy, and Japan can be made closer and more solid, without the need to adopt extreme methods fraught with danger. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) According to reports from Tokyo, Japan is unwilling to be drawn into the whirlpool of European strife unless it is used to deal with the Soviet Union, and is reluctant to offer a promise of assistance to the Axis powers. This news is well-received here. However, according to recent reports, Japanese military personnel are still seeking to get closer to Germany and Italy. The military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Italy is a strong advocate of forming a military alliance with Germany and Italy to deal with the Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance. He plans to return to Japan in the near future to strongly promote it. When he passes through here, he will secretly discuss everything with the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Germany and the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in the UK.

### Yugoslavia and Germany Have Not Concluded an Agreement, Prince Regent Paul Returns Home, Economic Negotiations Continue

(Berlin) Prince Regent Paul of Yugoslavia and his wife, who had been visiting Berlin for four days, left for home last night. Hitler personally saw them off at the station. According to German officials, no political agreement was concluded between Germany and Yugoslavia as a result of this trip. Reports that Germany had asked Yugoslavia to connect more closely with Germany or had persuaded Yugoslavia to join the Anti-Comintern Pact were unfounded speculation. German and Yugoslav representatives are still holding economic talks in Cologne. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

(Berlin) Prince Regent Paul of Yugoslavia continued his talks with Führer Hitler today. Afterwards, an official statement was issued stating that Prince Paul continued his talks with Führer Hitler today. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovic and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop were also present, lasting for several hours. Prince Paul's visit was to exchange views with the German authorities on various political issues on a broad scale. The process was extremely friendly. Both sides were able to discuss various issues related to the two countries openly and honestly, and they agreed that the current policies of the two countries should be continued because they are sincere, trusting, and closely cooperative. They also believe that this policy is constructive and is the foundation for maintaining relations between Yugoslavia and Germany and Italy, and is also one of the main factors for peace in Europe. The governments of Germany and Yugoslavia have now decided to jointly develop in the political, economic, and cultural fields on the basis of this clear and solid foundation, with the full agreement of Italy, believing that the tense state of the European situation can be eliminated by this and that progress can be made towards peace, in accordance with the rights related to the survival of all nations.

### British House of Commons Discusses the Far Eastern Situation, Japan Has No Right to Blockade the Chinese Coast, Discrimination Against British Merchants in Qingdao Has Been Protested

(London) After the House of Commons reconvened this afternoon, several members successively inquired about the Far Eastern situation. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler first commented on the issue of the Japanese navy blockading the Chinese coast, stating, "At the beginning of the war between China and Japan, the Japanese government announced a blockade of the entire Chinese coast, but at the same time, it clarified that the blockade method would only be applied to Chinese ships. In the British government's view, if this method were to be extended to the ships of other countries, it would be an attempt to exercise the rights of belligerents. However, since war has not been declared between China and Japan, a state of war cannot be considered to exist, so even if such an attempt is made, it is illegal. This view has been clearly communicated to the Japanese government." Morgan, a Labour Party member of the opposition, then asked, "Regarding the case of the British company's postal ship "Langpura" being intercepted, the Japanese government explained that it was a misunderstanding. Does the British government admit that this case has been closed?" Undersecretary Butler immediately replied, "Ships of all countries whose nationality is indeed doubtful can be inspected, but as far as "Langpura" is concerned, there is no doubt about its nationality. For this reason, we have clearly stated our position, and the Japanese side has also offered an explanation, saying that it was due to a misunderstanding." Morgan then asked, "Is this explanation satisfactory?" Undersecretary Butler is said to have replied, "Yes." Sir Sandeman, a Conservative Party member, asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, "As far as I know, the Japanese naval authorities in Qingdao, China, require British ships to obtain a permit for each bill of lading for goods to be unloaded. As a result, various goods are often stored in the open on the docks for several days before obtaining a permit, which may cause damage. At the same time, goods arriving in Qingdao on Japanese ships are not subject to this restriction. Is the Prime Minister aware of all these matters? Also, does the Prime Minister intend to notify the Japanese government that unless this method of restricting British trade is lifted, Britain will retaliate against Japanese ships arriving in British ports?" Undersecretary Butler immediately replied on behalf of the Prime Minister that Prime Minister Chamberlain was aware of the first two paragraphs of Sir Sandeman's inquiry. Goods arriving in Qingdao on Japanese ships have warehouses available for storage, while British ships have not yet received the same convenience. In addition to negotiations with the Japanese authorities there, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie has also negotiated with the Japanese government, hoping to obtain an answer as soon as possible. Mr. Tanharry, a Labour Party member of the opposition, asked, "The "currency" circulating in the Nanjing area of China is not recognized by foreign merchants. Regarding this matter, has the British government inquired with the Japanese government as to what measures it will take to protect British commercial interests? What was the Japanese side's reply?" Undersecretary Butler immediately presented a written reply stating, "The Huaxing Commercial Bank is a new bank established in accordance with the laws of the "Reformed Government" of China. It is permitted to issue banknotes but does not have the nature of a central bank. The total amount of capital is set at 50 million yuan. In order to maintain the exchange function of the banknotes issued, it has already stored foreign exchange equal to the amount of the issue as a reserve. This banknote is intended to supplement the existing legal tender and is not intended to replace it, and its status is the same as that of the legal tender. Except for customs duties, which are still paid in legal tender, other national taxes can be paid with banknotes from the Huaxing Bank. Also, under the current circumstances, there is no need for trade control and exchange management." (5th Havas Dispatch)

### The Philippines Hastens Large-Scale National Defense Construction: Renovating the Air Force and Adding Coastal Patrol Ships, Establishing New Barracks in Strategically Important Locations

Manila - The Philippine Army authorities, considering that the date of Philippine independence is only seven years away, and that the urgent situation in the Far East shows no sign of easing, have therefore engaged in a large-scale national defense construction program. In recent months, the defense construction movement of the Republic of the Philippines has focused on coastal patrol and the improvement of the air force. The number of "Q" type patrol boats will increase by two more in November of this year. According to the current plan, four or five "Q" type patrol ships will be purchased each year, so that the Philippine Navy will have forty patrol ships for coastal patrol in 1946. The equipment of these patrol boats includes heavy machine guns, torpedo laying machines, torpedoes, and bombs for attacking submarines. Eighteen aircraft of various types can be delivered to the Philippines within a few months, greatly increasing the strength of the air force, which is still in its infancy. The Army authorities pay special attention to land defense, and new barracks will soon be built in strategically important locations on the island. One of the barracks can be established in Parang, Mindanao Island, within this month. The Second Regiment of the First Regular Division plans to be permanently stationed there. The Parang Barracks will be the future defense center of the Philippine Islands and the economic development center of Mindanao Island. The highways on Mindanao Island are being built for both economic and military purposes. (6th United Press dispatch)

### Britain and Australia Jointly Manage, Australia's Position is Extremely Important: Once War Breaks Out in the Far East, Military Supplies and Food Can Be Completely Self-Sufficient

San Francisco - According to a report by the Pan-Pacific Association, the British and Australian governments are now working to make Australia a major base for British food and munitions manufacturing in the southwestern Pacific. Previously, Australia's supplies were all obtained from Britain, but if the current plan is successful, Britain will receive assistance from Australia no matter what serious events occur in the Far East. It is reported that this plan includes the establishment of storage facilities in rural Australia to avoid enemy attacks in wartime, etc. Among them, the most noteworthy is Australia's defense plan and the establishment of the munitions industry, because the success of this plan will enable Australia to be completely self-sufficient. In addition to the current industries, Australia will also add automobile, aircraft, and munitions industries. According to Australia's defense plan, it began to be implemented in May last year, and was strengthened after the Munich Agreement was concluded. As a result, although outsiders only know that Australia is an agricultural country, in fact, Australia has already ascended to an extremely important position. (6th United Press dispatch)

### US Naval Officer Serves as Japanese Spy: Leaking Naval Secrets, Appeal Rejected

(Washington) The US Supreme Court has rejected the appeal filed by Ensign Francis Wah, who confessed in 1937 to being a spy for Japan and was sentenced to imprisonment. According to the report, the ensign was arrested on July 13, 1936, for privately handing over a secret booklet of the US Navy's "Intelligence Work and Security" to the former naval attaché of the Japanese Embassy in the United States. After the Maritime Intelligence Office investigated his resume, it was discovered that this person had always been of improper conduct. He joined the Naval Academy in 1912 and graduated in 1915. Later, he also studied aviation. In 1927, he was tried by a military court in the Navy for negligence, (1) for violating the regulations of the Navy Department, (2) for private misconduct, which implicated the discipline and reputation of the Navy.

### US House of Representatives Drafts New Neutrality Law

(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee today began drafting a new bill to amend the Neutrality Act. Assistant Secretary of State Moore, Legal Advisor Hackworth, and Legal Expert Savage were all invited to attend to explain the State Department's views. After a long discussion, the first article of the bill proposed by Bloom, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, was finally passed by a large majority, and it was decided to continue discussing the other articles tomorrow. According to the current Neutrality Act, the state of war is determined by the president, who also announces the implementation of the Neutrality Act. The article that has been passed authorizes the president to declare the existence of a state of war when the peace of the United States and the lives of American citizens are threatened. In other words, the president will enjoy greater freedom when invoking the Neutrality Act. (5th Havas dispatch)

### Circumstances of British Submarine Disaster: Prime Minister Reports to the House of Commons, Preparation for a Public Investigation

(London) Yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons the circumstances of the disaster of the submarine "Thetis," saying that the case will be subject to a full and open investigation, and the Navy will also conduct a routine investigation. The report and evidence will be submitted to a public investigation for reference. The selection of the members of the public investigation committee is currently under active consideration. A member asked whether the public investigation will be conducted after the submarine is salvaged. The Prime Minister replied that it will be carried out as soon as possible, but a satisfactory conclusion cannot be reached until the submarine is salvaged and everything in the submarine is investigated. The Prime Minister also said that the tides have been very rapid in recent days, so divers can only enter the depths of the sea at high tide, making rescue work very difficult. It was said that the submarine suffered the disaster because it carried too many people, but this was not the case. Its sinking was caused by seawater filling the two front compartments of the submarine through the torpedo tubes. One of the torpedo tubes has already been opened, or was opened when the submarine was submerged in the water. This proves the above statement. The Prime Minister recounted the circumstances of the rescue of the submarine, saying that the rescue ship "Brazen" arrived and soon found the location of the sunken submarine, and communicated with the submarine by sonar signals. After a while, two people emerged from the sea using Davis escape gear. One was Captain Woram. He knew that the sunken submarine had been found, so he took a great risk to escape from the sunken submarine in order to direct the rescue work. His courage is admirable. Woram claimed that although everyone in the submarine was still alive, the situation in the submarine was gradually deteriorating. Soon, two more people floated to the surface. At that time, one diver entered the water to investigate and felt that it was very difficult to work. It was planned to drill a hole in the stern of the submarine, but it was abandoned because it was of no use. Before high tide, an attempt was made to tie an iron chain to the submarine and pull it up, but the chain broke and the submarine sank again. After several hours, the new location of the sunken submarine was found. At that time, deep-sea divers had arrived, so they resumed diving work, but it was obviously too late to rescue everyone in the submarine, so they only engaged in salvaging the submarine. The submarine had water pouring into the front compartment when adjusting the equipment in the submarine after diving. The main ballast was emptied by compressed air in order to make the submarine lighter and float to the surface, but the submarine still sank and was stranded on the seabed at a depth of 130 feet, forming an acute angle of 35 degrees.

### The United States, Both Government and Public, Prepare for a Warm Welcome to the British King: South Irish Republican Army Chief of Staff Arrested, Measures Taken to Prevent Possible Misconduct

Montreal - The British King and Queen are spending the night in their train tonight, and the train is speeding eastward all night. Before the King and Queen cross the border into the United States, they will only stop at three places. (6th Reuters dispatch)

(Washington) Tens of thousands of people have already arrived here. It is expected that on Thursday, more than 500,000 people will line the two-mile road that the British King and Queen will pass through. At that time, there will be 6,000 soldiers, seven military bands, cavalry, tanks, and police on motorcycles marching on the road. At the same time, there will be bombers and fighters flying in the sky. Flags and decorations have been hung on all the houses along the way, and the sidewalks will be fenced with iron chains to prevent people from breaking into the road. Secret detectives and police authorities have arranged strict security measures. British Ambassador Lindsay and US Secretary of State Hull are scheduled to depart for Niagara Falls today to welcome the British King and Queen. (6th Reuters dispatch)

Detroit, USA - General Russell, Chief of Staff of the South Irish Republican Army, was arrested here last night. (According to reports, the bombing cases that have occurred in various parts of the United Kingdom were committed by members of the Republican Army.) He is being closely monitored by the authorities and is forbidden to meet with lawyers. Some believe that the British King and Queen will arrive in Windsor, Ontario, Canada today, which is separated from this city by only a river. The authorities may fear that Russell has ulterior motives, so they arrested him as a precautionary measure. The local "Free Press" recently reported that General Russell had just arrived here yesterday from Chicago with MacBride, an important figure in the Republican Army, and was arrested at the station. MacBride was released shortly afterwards. According to his statement, General Russell came to the United States six weeks ago and traveled and lectured in various places. This time he came to Detroit with no special intentions. (6th Havas)

### Bulgaria and Italy Sign Cultural Agreement

Sofia, Bulgaria - A cultural agreement between Bulgaria and Italy was formally signed today by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov and the Italian Minister to Bulgaria. It mainly stipulates that Italian will be a compulsory subject in middle schools. Apart from this, it is not much different from the cultural agreements signed by Bulgaria with other countries. However, one point is quite important, that is, the Italian side uses the name of "King of Italy, Emperor of Abyssinia, and King of Albania", so Bulgaria has de facto recognized Italy's annexation of Albania.

### German and Italian Volunteers Return Home in Triumph: Hitler and the Italian King Hold Separate Reviews

(Berlin) The German "Condor" team of volunteers, after withdrawing from Spain, was reviewed by Hitler this morning at 10:00 in the city center. Participants, together with volunteers who had previously returned to the country in the Condor team, totaled 18,000 people. Air Minister General Göring, several Spanish generals, and the Spanish Ambassador Magaz, the Italian Ambassador Adolico, and the Japanese Ambassador General Oshima were all present. The welcome ceremony was held in Lustgarten until 12:30 in the afternoon. General Göring immediately gave a speech, praising the achievements of the "Condor" team soldiers, saying, "Your triumphant return is completely different from the situation in 1918. The German nation has now regained its sight, led by a great soldier, and the other leaders are also brave soldiers." Hitler then gave a brief speech on the Spanish Civil War in 1936, saying, "In July of that year, after obtaining the consent of Italy, we decided to assist General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army. This move was not only sufficient to save Europe, but also sufficient to save Germany. General Franco is a brave man who was able to save his country from danger and stop the invasion of Bolshevism. Our volunteers were right to go to the rescue. However, the multi-headed political democratic countries criticized it and reversed right and wrong. At this time, if those who promote the encirclement policy dare to invade our country, they will definitely be met with a painful blow. In short, the struggle we waged in Spain is enough to teach the enemy a lesson." The Führer then praised the bravery of the Italian volunteers and the Spanish soldiers, and shouted "Long live the Spanish nation and General Franco," "Long live the Italian nation and Prime Minister Mussolini," "Long live the German nation and the Condor team."

### The Duchess of Kent, Brother of the British King, is Endangered While Driving Out: The Residence Window of the British King's Sister, Princess Mary, Was Also Broken: Generally, It is Believed That There is a Considerable Connection Between These Two Cases

(London) The Duchess of Kent, brother of the British King, was driving to a movie theater in the West End tonight when someone fired at the car, but the car body was not hit. Not only was the Duchess not injured, but she was also unaware of it until someone told her about it after arriving at the movie theater. However, the person who fired the shot has been arrested by the police. It is said that this person came here from Australia three weeks ago and has been wandering around the Duchess's residence every day, and his actions are very suspicious. At the same time, the window of the residence of the Earl of Harewood (that is, George VI's sister, Princess Mary) was also broken by someone, mostly by air gun bullets. Some people believe that there may be a considerable connection between these two cases, but the police authorities do not attach importance to the latter. (5th Havas dispatch)

(London) Regarding the shooting at the Duchess of Kent last night, the Daily Mirror recently reported, "A man named Kilkuth was driving past the scene at this time when he suddenly heard a gunshot. He quickly stopped the car and looked around, and saw a man sitting on the ground with a gun, pointing the muzzle at the street, with a bicycle next to him. He immediately questioned him, but the man's words were vague and incomprehensible, so he drove to the police station to report it. Then, a policeman accompanied him to the scene and saw the man still sitting in the same place, so he arrested him and took him to the police station. It was verified that the gun he was carrying had just been fired, and he was immediately detained, and it was found that he had come here from Australia two weeks ago. It is said that the Duke of Kent has been appointed as the Governor-General of Australia and is scheduled to go to take office with the Duchess in October of this year. (6th Havas dispatch)

### Recent Developments in Europe: London Dispatch – The Gathering Storm over the Mediterranean

— Shudi

Following Litvinov's resignation, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which had been proceeding cautiously, loosened up. Now, the Soviet representative originally scheduled to attend the Geneva conference, Potemkin, unexpectedly cancelled his planned trip a few days ago. Consequently, the Anglo-Soviet cooperation talks, which had reached a considerable stage, were temporarily put on hold. Judging from the current situation, it is unlikely that these negotiations will be seriously revived in the near future.

This shelving of Anglo-Soviet negotiations is, in reality, merely a phenomenon, a result, and certainly not the cause. What is the reason for it? There are two main and direct reasons: First, on the bright side, it is due to the recent establishment of the Anglo-Turkish alliance. From Britain's perspective, this has completely laid the foundation for a future Anglo-Soviet alliance. Now, most of the countries surrounding the Soviet Union have entered into mutual or unilateral assistance agreements with Britain. In her view, this already demonstrates complete sincerity in cooperating with the Soviet Union. As for further solidifying her alliance relationship with the Soviet Union through a treaty, that is merely a matter of procedure. However, Britain does not feel it necessary at this time, as she has not yet made a firm decision to strike at the global aggressor nations. From the Soviet Union's perspective, because Potemkin recently visited the Balkan Peninsula and Poland, he has confirmed the trust of various countries in the Soviet Union. Therefore, after the surrounding countries have already formed alliances with Britain, the Soviet Union does not necessarily need to be eager to form an alliance with Britain. Thus, in essence, Britain became complacent, and the Soviet Union became lax. Second, on the dark side, recently within Britain, because Mussolini delivered a relatively peaceful speech in Turin, the power of the pro-German appeasement faction has risen again. They are still advising the current government to make another attempt at negotiations with Germany, offering some possible concessions as conditions for Hitler to accept "peace," and asking him to specifically put them forward. As a result, the current British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, has received orders to immediately present two points to the German authorities: (1) If Germany genuinely desires "peace," then it should hurry and propose it while Britain is still "willing to listen"; (2) Otherwise, in his "personal" view, Britain is now in a completely superior international military position vis-à-vis Germany. Therefore, when Britain had essentially become complacent, on the surface, she deliberately made a great show of negotiating Anglo-Soviet cooperation, while on the other hand, she was conducting behind-the-scenes haggling negotiations with Germany. At this time, for the sake of diplomatic maneuvering, the Soviet Union adopted the tactic of Potemkin suddenly halting his trip to Geneva.

As a result, Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been temporarily suspended. Consequently, the overall situation in Europe has also eased for a short period. However, everyone should immediately pay close attention to the fact that, on the other hand, the Anglo-Soviet stalemate has therefore fallen into a tense web. Is the possibility of a Soviet-German rapprochement progressing again? Like a venomous insect, this question is persistently gnawing at the hearts of the Anglo-French appeasers.

Thus, in the past few days, Anglo-French public opinion has again been vigorously pressuring the government, and the government has had no choice but to quickly take steps to reassure the Soviet Union.

This is one of the main items for the upcoming Halifax-Bonnet talks in Paris.

These are the most important trends in Europe today. However, here we encounter a question: Why? Since Britain and France only wish to maintain a consistent stance with the Soviet Union, mainly to bargain with Germany and Italy, why are they so anxious upon hearing even a hint of a German-Soviet rapprochement?

The answer to this question, at the most urgent point, lies in the tension of the situation in the Mediterranean Sea, so the eyes of all of Europe are currently focused on the developing storm over the Mediterranean.

Now, please open a map of Europe. At the western end of the Mediterranean Sea, the only opening to the ocean is the world-famous Strait of Gibraltar. At the eastern end, it is the Suez Canal, which connects to the Red Sea. Everyone knows that this is the most vital lifeline for maritime transport for Britain and France. However, at the same time, everyone also knows that this is the only and most fundamental base for Germany and Italy to develop their dreams of a great empire.

In previous dispatches, this reporter has pointed out some recent military preparations and political conspiracies of Germany and Italy in Africa. The part of Africa referred to there is located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Naturally, those preparations and conspiracies have not stopped recently, but have intensified. However, there have been no noteworthy new developments. What is attracting our attention now is at both ends of the Mediterranean Sea: the western end, the shifting situation in Spain; the eastern end, the hesitation and divergent paths of the Balkan countries – fundamentally speaking, it is the same thing: the pressure from Germany and Italy is intensifying.

(1) There are two most noteworthy events in the recent situation in Spain: First, the German fleet unexpectedly left; second, Göring's planned trip to Spain was suddenly cancelled. These indicate one thing: There are problems again in the process of Germany and Italy exerting pressure on Franco to turn him into a completely submissive slave.

Of course, Franco will eventually remain a slave, but the problems, although not big, still exist.

Where are the problems? Everyone knows that Franco has accepted the pressure from Germany and Italy and joined the "Anti-Comintern Pact." He has also offered almost all the land to the strategists of Germany and Italy as a base for their future war against Britain and France, arranging it in advance. However, there is one thing that he has not accepted to this day: On the day of formally celebrating the victory of the civil war, he clearly stated to Britain that he would reclaim the lost territory – the British-owned Gibraltar naval port in the Strait of Gibraltar. Franco has been refusing this all along, because his thoughts of borrowing money from Britain and France have never ceased. Therefore, the date of celebrating "victory" has been postponed again and again. Correspondingly, the issue of Germany and Italy withdrawing volunteer soldiers, which has been anxiously demanded by Britain and France, Germany and Italy have also refused to budge.

This stalemate continued until recently, when it suddenly brewed into two very serious crises involving both domestic and foreign affairs: Based on Germany, the leader of the most reactionary fascist faction in Spain, the current Minister of the Interior, Suñer, recently planned a political conspiracy to replace Franco. This was suddenly exposed, greatly displeasing Franco to Germany. Therefore, as a demonstration, on the one hand, he requested Germany and Italy in writing to first show him where they were superior to the British and French armies; otherwise, he was unwilling to openly oppose Britain. On the other hand, he told the British ambassador that, in fact, he would eventually break with Germany and Italy, but "the time was not yet ripe." If this situation continues to develop, unless Franco completely surrenders or is overthrown entirely, then the forces of international struggle may take advantage of Spain as a stage to have another civil war. At the same time, in that Spain under Franco's rule, the old forces of the former government army are lurking here and there, waiting for an opportunity to reappear. This is the first crisis at the moment. It is said that, in order to completely eradicate the possibility of British financial forces infiltrating Spain, the recent German ambassador to Spain suddenly received orders. Based on this, he warned Franco that March, Franco's biggest financial backer, who is generally considered to be too pro-British, must be removed immediately. However, Franco actually refused. Therefore, this has now created another tension between Germany and Italy and Franco, becoming the second crisis. (To be continued)

Active Chinese Troops in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Area: Gunfire Heard in Hangzhou

Hangzhou Dispatch: Chinese troops in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area have been very active recently. A brief account is as follows:

Hangzhou Area

Chinese troops in the four suburbs of Hangzhou have approached the city, so gunfire is often heard in the city. Skirmishes have occurred near Songmuchang and outside Qingbo Gate. As a result, more than 30 Japanese soldiers were killed or captured. Chinese troops on the outskirts of Tanglou Town in the Hangzhou suburbs also attacked a Japanese motorboat, killing more than 20 Japanese and puppet soldiers. Several piers of the Qianjiang Bridge have been blown up by Chinese commandoes on the south bank. The Japanese garrison in the Shihuiqiao area on the outskirts of the city was set on fire by Chinese troops. When the flames soared into the sky, the Japanese soldiers fled from the fire, some being killed or wounded.

Jiaxing Area

The base of the Chinese guerrilla forces in Baihuating near Haiyan County was attacked by more than 200 Japanese soldiers the other day. The Chinese troops blocked the Japanese and surrounded them. The Japanese used sulfur guns to disrupt the Chinese forces. As a result, the Chinese completely annihilated the Japanese soldiers, but 181 civilian houses in the town were burned down by bullets. The other day, 50 or 60 Japanese soldiers passing through Xiaochizhen in the county were also severely attacked by Chinese troops, with no Japanese soldiers surviving. Chinese troops in the southern suburbs of Jiaxing were planning to attack the Japanese camp in the seed breeding ground on the outskirts of the city. However, when they reached Shiba Liqiao, ten miles from the city, they encountered more than 100 Japanese soldiers. A fierce battle broke out. Later, the Chinese troops feigned defeat and lured the Japanese to Gujiabangyiwangqiao, where they used the terrain to surround and annihilate the Japanese. At the same time, another unit of Chinese troops attacked the Japanese defenses in Guojie Township (the ancient battlefield of Wu and Yue). A fierce artillery battle broke out between the two sides. The result is unknown, but according to eyewitnesses, Japanese corpses were transported by trucks along the Hangzhou-Jiaxing Highway, indicating that the Japanese suffered heavy casualties.

Jiashan Area

Fierce battles have been taking place in Zhangjinghui, the northern suburbs of the city, Jiuliwan, and other places since the 1st. In order to protect railway transportation, the Japanese army forced local people to wear Japanese military uniforms, carry guns, and sit in trains to patrol, while more than a dozen Japanese soldiers were hiding in the trains. It is said that since the implementation of this measure, about 50 Chinese have been killed by guerrillas who mistakenly identified them as Japanese soldiers.

Huzhou Area

Chinese troops in the four suburbs of Wuxing, in Qingshan, once raided the Japanese camp in a nearby area at night. Japanese soldiers in Xinshi have been wiped out. A fierce battle broke out in the southern suburbs of Wuzhen. The Chinese troops took advantage of the victory and advanced towards the Japanese defenses in Nan Zha. Twelve Japanese cavalrymen in the Liujiaoshi area were killed by the Chinese, who also captured twelve war horses. Battles have also been taking place in the outskirts of Wangjiang for several days. The most fierce battle occurred last night when the railway was destroyed, and battles broke out with Japanese and puppet soldiers. Shen Mingcai, the magistrate of Chongde County, led the self-defense corps to raid the Japanese troops in Shimen in the middle of the night the other day, killing and capturing many. Chinese troops in the outskirts of Tongxiang rushed directly to the city the day before yesterday. The Japanese soldiers in the city opened the north gate and fled. The Chinese troops took the opportunity to rush in, but soon gave up. Chinese troops in Pinghu have captured Quan Gongting and launched a fierce attack on the city walls last night. Three Japanese boats near Liushe in Deqing were discovered by the Chinese, who threw more than a dozen hand grenades from the bridge, sinking all the motorboats.

### Commemorating Teacher's Day: Dedicated to the Wise Teachers

— Zhang Tuo

Wise teachers, education is the lifeblood of the country. It is the main factor for the inevitable victory of the war of resistance. It is the permanent foundation for national reconstruction after the war. What a great responsibility you bear.

However, please ask yourselves, how much effort have you exerted in the past in the field of education? Have you let down the general youth in any way? How has the educational effect you have achieved affected society? Can you give an account to the country?

Wise teachers,

You are the mentors of the youth. Your words and deeds need to be exemplary. You must also do your best to promote our initiative and avoid the deeply ingrained negativity of the past thousands of years. For example, doubt, friction, laziness, and pleasure are all biased towards negativity. They not only cannot promote all undertakings, but also consume a lot of useful energy, hinder a lot of progress, and even delay the major affairs of the country. Each of us must put the interests of the country and the nation first. We must propagate for the country and the nation, act for the country and the nation, and think for the country and the nation. In short, we must engage in education for the country and the nation.

Wise teachers,

I have always believed that the quality of a teacher depends solely on asking him whether his faith in the country and the nation is firm, whether he has a deep understanding of the essence of education, and whether he can regard education as a lifelong career and view students as his own children. I also believe that there is no so-called teaching method in education. Only the word "loyalty" is the only way to teach. The attitude of a teacher should have three conditions: learning without boredom, teaching without weariness, and acting without confusion. Learning without boredom is the advancement of knowledge. Teaching without weariness is the effort of teaching. Acting without confusion is the determination of will. These three are not only the attitudes that teachers should have, but also the correct outlook on life for teachers. Wise teachers,

Who in the world is more hardworking and meritorious than you? And who is more sinful than you? Because the progress and fall of children and youth, saving the country and betraying the country, building the country and harming the country are all in your hands. Therefore, you are not only the leaders of the students, but also the mentors of the entire country and nation. However, since the responsibility you bear is so great, and the treatment you receive is very meager, yet you can still tirelessly teach people and bury yourself in hard work. Everyone admires and appreciates your great spirit of sacrifice. On behalf of the compatriots across the country, I pay my respects to you.

### Most of the Elementary Schools in the Soviet Guerrilla Areas Have Been Restored: War Education is Promoted in Accordance with Ministry Orders

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is very thoughtful in promoting the education plan in the guerrilla areas in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Education.

### The Zhejiang Department of Education Urges the Payment of the Centennial Education Fund: To Emphasize the Education Cause

(Fangyan Dispatch) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education advocated raising a Centennial Education Fund, originally to thoroughly cultivate educational talents. For several years, education agencies in various cities and counties have handled it, and the results have been quite effective. Since the outbreak of the military, counties such as Hang, Jia, and Hu in western Zhejiang have become war zones, and the matter of handling the Centennial Education Fund has inevitably been affected. However, the education agencies in eastern Zhejiang can still continue to carry it out with great effort, but the effectiveness has been greatly reduced. The Education Department has issued a special order to the municipal and county governments to quickly collect and remit the funds as many education agencies have not paid the Centennial Fund on time in recent months, in order to emphasize the education cause and not be negligent.

### Securities: The Downward Trend of Foreign Debt Has Not Been Contained, Domestic Debt is Still Hovering, and Foreign Stocks are Still Mostly Quoted Higher

London Chinese foreign debt market prices on the 5th of this month (Monday) once again saw a downward trend, with various bonds falling by half a pound to three pounds. Among the top-tier public bonds, the Anglo-French loan English-issued bond fell by three pounds, with a price of fifty-four pounds. The Crisp Loan fell by two pounds, with a price of thirty-three pounds. The Anglo-German Continued Loan English-issued bond and the In克斯 Aircraft English-issued bond each fell by one pound, with the former priced at sixty-four pounds, a new low for this year, and the latter priced at sixteen and a half pounds. The Sino-French US Dollar 5% bond, the printed bond and the Rehabilitation Loan English-issued bond each fell by half a pound, with the former priced at sixty-one and a half pounds and the latter priced at forty-nine and a half pounds. The lower-tier railway bonds, starting with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway bond, remained stable, but the first five types fluctuated by half a pound to one pound. The Longhai Railway printed bond uniquely rose by half a pound, with a price of eighteen pounds. The Hukuang Railway non-German issued printed bond fell by half a pound, with a price of twenty-one pounds. The remaining three types each fell by half a pound, with the Daokou-Qinghua Railway bond priced at twenty pounds, the Hukuang Railway German-issued printed bond priced at nineteen and a half pounds, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway bond priced at twenty-four pounds. In the London physical market, there was strong demand for Rehabilitation Loan bonds, with 5,000 pounds of English-issued bonds sold at a price of forty-nine pounds, a discount from the market price of pounds. In addition, 10,000 pounds of French-issued printed bonds were sold at a price of forty-seven pounds, a discount of two and a half pounds from the English-issued listed price. In addition, 12,500 pounds of Russian-issued printed bonds were sold at a price of forty-three and a half pounds, a discount of six pounds from the English-issued listed price. However, regarding the Rehabilitation Loan French-issued printed bonds, it is reported that there is an appetite for 1,600 pounds, with no limit price set. Also, in the local market, there are also 50,000 pounds of Tianjin-Pukou Railway Continued Loan German-issued unprinted bonds, also without a limit price for purchase.

Ever since the Anglo-French incident with China, the acknowledgement of the current situation everywhere has caused one side's arrogance to increase, with a great possibility of joining Germany and Italy to threaten England and France. As a result, the interests of England and France in the Far East are in jeopardy, and almost all of the customs and salt taxes have been seized, leaving the principal and interest unpaid. The exchange stabilization fund lent to it has been absorbed by the Japanese side in various ways due to the maintenance of the black market. As a result, there is considerable nostalgia for Chinese bonds in Europe. Therefore, the decline in foreign debt over the past week is as follows:

Compared with May 30, the Anglo-German Continued Loan (English-issued) fell by 3.50, the Sino-French US Dollar (printed) fell by 1.75, the Anglo-French Loan (English-issued) fell by 6.75, the Crisp Loan fell by 2.75, and the Rehabilitation English Gold (English-issued) fell by 2.25.

In the domestic debt gray market, yesterday's market situation, after hovering, was exhausted and then recovered. The multi-party defenses were extremely strong, and the sellers ultimately felt weak. The situation on the floor was most noteworthy, that is, whenever the market price was slightly lower, trading immediately decreased; when the market price was slightly higher, there was excitement and lively trading. It can be seen that most people have extremely strong confidence in public bonds, because the Ding category is about to hold its seventh lottery drawing, and all unified public bonds will pay interest. Therefore, short sellers are wary. Since the environment has not changed and people's minds are stable, and because the US and French ambassadors went to Chongqing together, which is said to be related to the war, the multi-party's confidence is even stronger. Yesterday's activity: When the market opened in the morning, there was considerable appetite for number 35, and the market price once rose slightly. Subsequently, the selling pressure increased, with Yuyuan Runli selling the most. Yongkang Lemao Songmao also sold, although numbers 5, 16, and Tongkang absorbed some, it still failed to stabilize. The Bing category once broke through the three-yuan mark. In the after-market, Runli turned from selling to buying, and Tongkang turned from buying to selling, showing that people's minds were not unified. However, number 35 continued to buy, and Dafeng also gradually showed appetite. Lianhe stopped selling, and retail investors mostly sold, mostly chaotic and unstable. The market price result: the Jia, Yi, and Bing categories had no gains or losses, while the Ding and Wu categories each fell slightly by one jiao. The total transaction volume was more than 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

There were no stock transactions, but the seller of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company shares asked for 7 yuan and 7 jiao, which has not yet been成交.

In the Public Industry Association, the stock market opened slightly weak, but soon many buyers appeared, and the market atmosphere became active and firm. Jardine shares had no fluctuations for several weeks, but suddenly turned excellent yesterday. Buyers scrambled to buy, rising from 18 yuan and 8 jiao to 19 yuan and 6 jiao. International Trust shares rose to 5 yuan, and Yangtze Bank shares rose to 8 yuan, both appearing strong. Yiesong shares were slightly better at a price of 110 yuan (excluding interest of 4 yuan). Yeguang shares were stable at a price of 9 yuan and 8 jiao. Although the transaction volume of Reclamation shares was very large, the price change was very small. Kaiping shares rose to 31 yuan and 5 jiao following the London price increase. As for the six-tael preference shares of electricity, previously there were two estates, one of which held a majority of these shares and wanted to liquidate and sell them. However, it is now expected that these shares have been sold off, so they have risen to 128 yuan and a half.

The rubber stock market was slightly calm, but there was no mass selling. The transaction prices of English Chartered shares and Rubber Trust shares were almost the same as before. The stock of British rubber raw materials increased by 998 tons last week, and now there are a total of 65,508 tons in stock.

The China General Edison Company's eight-percent bonds dramatically rose from 60 taels to 73 taels. Although the bonds have risen to 73 taels, they are still cheap compared to the price of common shares. If calculated on this basis, each hundred taels of eight-percent bonds, at the market price, is equivalent to 260 shares of common stock. However, calculating the value of the eight-percent bonds, it should be more than the above-mentioned number of common shares. Now, if the price of common shares is counted in jiao, then the bonds can be worth 105 taels and 6 qian. Sooner or later, the values of the two will balance, either the price of common shares will decrease, or the price of bonds will rise.

London English Far East Company stocks on the 5th of this month (Monday) saw a slight increase. HSBC shares each rose by one pound, with English-registered shares rising to eighty-six pounds and Hong Kong-registered shares rising to eighty-seven pounds. The Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares recovered by six pence, with a price of twenty-one shillings and six pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Frightening News - Single Yarn Plummets by 47 Yuan

The downstream yarn market is experiencing an increasingly severe decline. Sales to customer groups have stalled, morale is weak, and those holding excess inventory are slightly selling off. The trading floor is loosening. As for the 32-count "Fairy Maiden" single yarn, which had been soaring for days, its demand dried up and plummeted by 47 yuan. However, it is said that in the afternoon, the Hunan customer group bought a few bales, and the upward trend resumed, recovering 20 yuan. This kind of up-and-down situation is unimaginable in the business world. In fact, it has already entered its peak, and the changes are therefore vast. It is found that actual sales on the market are indeed sluggish, and retail sellers are unloading at market prices. However, two large companies are still coming to buy. The Chaoshan customer group has been buying a lot in recent days and will naturally take a break to digest their inventory before buying again.

Regarding the current yarn situation, at the opening of the market this morning, the opinions of the industry peers were moderate. After the general mobile brokers inquired around, the customer groups did not show any buying activity, and the situation was lazy. The opening price fell by about four or five yuan. The spot price of 20-count "Double Horse" is currently 428 or 429 yuan, and the warehouse order price is 420 yuan. The customer demand for 32-count single yarn, which has been soaring in recent days, has stopped, and buyers are scarce. Only three bales of "Fairy Maiden" were sold, a drop of 47 yuan from the previous day to 615 yuan. However, those with a large amount of stock are still unwilling to sell. A certain cotton firm suddenly bought 20-count "Double Globe" because the price fell too much, recovering a few yuan in an instant. At the close of the market, the spot price of "Double Horse" was 430 yuan, and the warehouse order price was 424 yuan and a half. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong customer group bought a little, and the market situation turned quiet. The Hunan customer group bought fifteen bales of 32-count "Fairy Maiden" single yarn, and the price rose again by 20 yuan to 635 yuan. The spot price of 20-count "Double Horse" was 430 yuan and 5 jiao, and the warehouse order price was 425 yuan and a half. It is found that the total amount bought by various customer groups throughout the day was 1,425 bales. The market price of 32-count "Fairy Maiden" single yarn fell sharply by 27 yuan compared with the price of the previous day, 20-count "Double Horse" fell by 3 yuan, "Shepherd" fell by 3 yuan, "Double Globe" fell by 1 yuan, and 10-count "Boy Scout Double Globe" fell by 1.2 yuan. Shenxin Factory opened 150 bales of 5-count 2-ply "Boy Scout" at a price of 350 yuan (full deduction), with delivery from June to September. Rongfeng Factory opened 75 bales of 18-count "Golden Bridge" at a price of 335 yuan, with delivery from July to September. Hefeng Factory opened 100 bales of 8-count "Ren Zhong" at a price of 350 yuan (full deduction), with delivery from June to September. Today, there were 370 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Tianjin, 100 pieces transported to Yantai, 1,270 pieces transported to Shantou, 610 pieces transported to Hong Kong, 120 pieces transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 625 pieces transported to Beihai. The amount bought by each customer group is listed on the left:

The Japanese yarn market started well and then leveled off, and the result was not much different from the previous day. The market sentiment in the North Road area was slightly higher due to some business. The closing price of 20-count "Yueqin" for this month was 371 yuan and a half.

### Foreign Cotton Prices Rise Daily, Making it Difficult for Manufacturers to Buy

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market is particularly active. Because various rumors about barter are quite strong, the number of cloths sold has greatly increased in recent days, arousing purchases from domestic and foreign parties, especially from European parties. However, there has been no news about the government's loan of cotton until now. The spot market is extremely scarce, so the selling price is high. The price for July has reached a new high of 9.18. According to the current trend, it is still possible to continue to rise. Yesterday, New York rose 10 to 15 points, India, including the same price measurement, rose sharply by 3 rupees, and Egypt rose 20 points. The legal tender cotton prices all rose, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton rising by 1 yuan and 6 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rising by 1 yuan and 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rising by 1 yuan and 8 jiao.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, because the overseas cotton market is rising, various parties have a strong intention to purchase, but they cannot start. Therefore, they can only temporarily wait and see. Yesterday, among the industry peers, there were some transactions for Indian cotton 10-count raw material "Plain Fruit", with a total of 1,000 bales being traded yesterday, all shipped in June and July. There were no transactions from the factory side. The equivalent factory prices of yesterday's cotton market are listed below:

The business in Chinese cotton is still at a standstill. As for foreign cotton, the price has been gradually rising in the past two days, and the conversion price is very high. All parties are also hesitant to purchase. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign cotton transactions are quiet. Only one transaction was made for spot cotton: one hundred and twenty-five pieces of Xiasha packaged cotton were traded among industry peers at a price of 179 yuan and 3 jiao, with payment and delivery at the warehouse. 110 bales of cotton from Subei arrived in Tongzhou. Today, there were 30 pieces of cotton transported to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: New Cocoon Transport to Shanghai - Conflicting Rumors - What Can Be Done if Transport is Impossible?

The Shanghai-Hangzhou line has already ceased cocoon transport, and the date of arrival in Shanghai is still uncertain. Moreover, there are many rumors, which make people in the industry extremely anxious. Now, news has come from a certain party that there are two "methods" for solving the problem of spring cocoons coming to Shanghai. One is that all fresh cocoons can be transported to Shanghai after paying certain "taxes". However, there is an attached condition, that is, after this dried cocoon is reeled into silk, it must be sold to a certain Japanese trading firm for export before it can pass. Second, "Central China" intends to force cocoon merchants to sell half of the dried cocoons it collects to "Huaxing" at its price before it can be transported to Shanghai. Before these two points are confirmed, they can only be regarded as rumors. However, these two rumors also have their roots, that is, the Japanese are invading China, that is, monopolizing the Chinese market, and that is, squeezing out the economic interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in China. Therefore, it is also possible to use the detention of cocoons as a condition that they must be sold to Japanese trading firms for export. However, it feels that these methods seem too clumsy. Secondly, the saying that "Central China" intends to forcibly buy half of the cocoons is the prelude to robbing all of them. How it will develop in the future still needs to be proven by facts. Among the more accurate news that can be revealed by the more solid and or can peek inside the curtain, there is news from Japanese trading firms that there have been several cases of internal accusations within "Central China" due to conflicting opinions and interests regarding the robbery of this material. It seems more valuable. However, according to people in the industry, Shanghai silk factories that went to collect cocoons are also responsible for the heavy obstacles to spring cocoons in Zhejiang, that is, the concentration of fresh cocoons by the few factories in the Jiahu area led to a drop in cocoon prices (only half of that in the Wuxi area). This kind of low-priced cocoon collection is also akin to making a fortune from national disasters, which is naturally envied by the puppet organization and the invaders. Coupled with the various special conditions after the war, there is a scene of the mantis catching the cicada and the oriole behind. There is always someone stronger, and as I write this, I am truly sighing. (Xiang)

### Overseas Silk Prices Rebound, Local Silk Sales Active

The overseas silk market rebounded sharply yesterday. Yokohama spot prices rose by 40 yuan, forward prices rose by 27 yuan, New York spot prices rose by 1 jiao in the near term, forward prices rose by 8 fen, and Japanese silk spot prices rose by 4 fen to 5 fen. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each rose by 5 fen. This proves that the prediction in the magazine was accurate.

After the fall in the local silk market last week, it turned quiet. Yesterday, driven by the rise in overseas silk prices, silk sales in the UK, US, and France became active. Renchang, Renji, Dachang, and other firms all increased their purchases yesterday. Unfortunately, because manufacturers still held firm prices, the transaction volume only reached 100 dan. According to the sales firm's report, the price of white factory silk with an 85-fen uniformity was 1,930 yuan, the price of 78-fen coarse striped silk was 1,870 yuan, the XB price was 1,820 yuan, and the zebra grade was 1,840 yuan, not far from the price before the sharp fall in silk prices.

### Finance: Gold Market Hovers, Trading Extremely Quiet

Yesterday's spot gold gray market situation was first down and then up, showing a hovering trend. At first, because the spot firms had a strong desire to sell and some bulls in a certain gold firm also came to close their positions, the market was weak. Later, retail investors took advantage of the low price to buy, and the South China customer group also came to activity, gradually turning firm and finally reversing to rise by 3 yuan. There were very few transactions, with only more than 300 taels traded throughout the day. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops was 1 yuan lower, the price of customs gold remained the same, and the prices of Sino-English pure gold, etc., fell slightly.

Spot Gray Market Rose by 2 Yuan

From the morning, the initial market situation was still weak, with a price of 2,093 yuan for each bar (ten taels) by the first by the spot firm for a total of 70 taels to a money exchange shop, which was 1 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Not long after, the bull in a certain gold firm also came to close their positions, selling 100 taels to the money exchange shop, all at a price of 92 yuan. At that time, retail investors took advantage of the low price to buy, and customer groups also had a desire to buy, so it gradually recovered. The money exchange shop bought 50 taels from the silver shop customer group at a price of 93 yuan, and then bought 20 taels from fellow merchants at a price of 94 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm (on behalf of the South China customer group) bought 50 taels from the securities customer group, and the price jumped up by 2 yuan, to 96 yuan. After that, supply and demand became scarce, and no transactions were seen until noon, so the noon closing price was still 96 yuan. The market was quite quiet in the afternoon, and there were no transactions for a long time. It was not until 3:45 that the spot firm sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange shop, still at a price of 96 yuan, which was quite stable. Until the evening closing price, it was still 2,096 yuan, a result of a 2 yuan rise from the previous day. The whole day was only 4 yuan high and low. The spot firm's gold book offered a price of 1,100 yuan, and took in 2,090 yuan. The current margin is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there is a price but no market.

Jewelry Gold Dropped 1 Yuan Yesterday

The initial exchange price for jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was reduced by one yuan because it was heard that the spot market was still weak. Datong Bank changed to 213 yuan, and Xin Bank was 211 yuan, taking in 205 yuan.

English Pure Gold Fell by Half a Penny

According to the London wire on the 5th, English pure gold fell by half a penny per ounce because the pound continued to be high, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 4 pence, and a half. This caused the Bank of China's spot purchase price to also fall to 1,211 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of customs gold remained the same at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price was also 3 jiao lower, at 1,206 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Futures: Supply Relatively Strong

Yesterday's inter-bank exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar gradually increased, rising by 1.3 to 1.875. The number of settlements by foreign firms increased, and Chinese firms also bought more and sold less. In the local foreign exchange market, the British pound should have been tight and the US dollar loose, but because British banks such as HSBC and Mercantile still maintained the original price of 8 pence and 25 to supply British gold, and US banks were unwilling to release US dollars at a loose price, the spot prices of both the British pound and the US dollar tended to be consistent. Although futures were purchased by Chinese firms, foreign banks had a good willingness to supply, so the market was slightly firm. Trading was still strong in the morning and turned quiet in the afternoon. The Hong Kong exchange rate weakened slightly because foreign firms' willingness to sell was not strong.

In the early morning, the long-term and short-term London large strips were 0.0625 higher, the New York silver price was stagnant, and the London bullion price was reduced by half a penny. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was 1.3 higher, and the rate against Shanghai and France remained the same. The US dollar rose by 1.875 against the British pound, rose by 2 fen against Shanghai, and rose by 1.25 against France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 8 pence and 25 for the British pound and 16 yuan and 0.09375 for the US dollar, with no change compared to the previous closing price. After the opening, although the settlement by foreign firms was busy, the lack of change was due to banks were willing to sell. It is said that the foreign firms first settled HSBC spot British gold at 8 pence and 25, and then purchased Huabi spot US exchange at 16 yuan and 0.09375. When the HSBC list was announced without change, and the silver balance tax was announced at a large percentage of half a percentage, a tax of 5.00%, the foreign firms came again to settle Huabi July US exchange at 16 yuan. Later, Chinese firms also followed to buy Anda and Dutch August US exchange at 15 yuan and 0.9375. The market situation was stable and seemed slightly firm. Nearing noon, there was only Hong Kong exchange buying and selling. It is said that money exchange shops settled the foreign bank Dutch spot price at only 55 yuan and 125, which was slightly soft. The banks' noon closing spot selling prices for British and American exchange were the same as the morning opening prices. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55.5 yuan and 125.

The trading was suddenly scarce in the after-market. No transaction for the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar had been reported, and only some transactions for the July British pound had been made. It is said that the Chinese firms traded with each other, and the price sold by the Bombay Bank to the Orient was 8 pence and 0.21875, so the price had no gains or losses. Until the evening closing price, the banks' spot selling prices for British and American exchange were 8 pence and 25 and 16 yuan and 0.09375, respectively. The result was that the spot prices of British and American exchange were still the same as the previous evening's closing price, and the futures were stable and slightly firm. The Hong Kong exchange rate was softened by 0.125 after calculating according to the transaction price.

### Large Denomination Japanese Banknotes See Sudden Surge in Demand

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar did not move. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms had a strong desire to settle, and the banks provided smooth supply. At the opening of the spot market, gold firms supplied, and the market was slightly soft. After entering the market, money exchange shops suddenly had a strong desire to buy, taking advantage of the low price to absorb, and the market price rose instead of falling, turning firm. In the afternoon, supply and demand were relatively scarce, and the situation was very stable. The result was that it rose by 2 yuan compared to the previous day. As for foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds, supply and demand were evenly matched, and the market was stable. American gold pounds and British gold pounds rose slightly against each other. The trading of American gold tickets was very smooth, and they all tended to rise due to increased demand. There was strong demand for Hong Kong tickets, and the number of tickets tended to be tight, and the market price rose again. The supply and demand of French franc tickets was not strong, and the market was stable. The demand for Italian tickets recovered, and the price continued to be expensive. The supply and demand of Japanese currency was quite active, and the market price was low for small denominations and expensive for large denominations. Small denominations were 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan tickets, while large denominations were 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1,000 yuan tickets. Usually, the market price is based on small denominations, and the difference between the prices of small and large denominations is only 1 fen or only 23 li. Yesterday, a certain foreign bank needed tens of thousands of yuan in large-denomination Japanese currency, so the money exchange shop filled the need by supplying small denominations to replace the large denominations. The difference between small and large denominations reached as high as 3 fen, which is impossible for those outside the industry to match. The price of Japanese gold tickets in the morning was 9 jiao, 1 fen, and 7 li. Later, because the supply tended to be strong, it dropped to 9 jiao, 1 fen, and 5 li. In the afternoon, it rebounded to 9 jiao and 2 fen. The price of Korean tickets in the morning was 8 jiao and 3 fen, which fell to 8 jiao, 2 fen, and 5 li, and the result was 8 jiao, 2 fen, and 7 li. The exchange transaction was very scarce. Only Zhenxing sold American gold tickets to Tongfeng for 800 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold tickets rose by 2 fen, American gold pounds rose by 1 jiao, American gold tickets rose by 2 li, Hong Kong tickets rose by 1 li, Italian tickets rose by 1 fen, and all other currencies remained unchanged.

### Grains: New Wheat from Various Places is Being Sampled

Since the first batch of new wheat was put on the market the day before yesterday, wheat samples from various places have been sent to Shanghai one after another. It is said that there are also new samples from the Wusong area nearby, and the quality is still good. It is also said that the second batch of new wheat from Chenmu has arrived in 40 odd bags, with a price of 5 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen. Because it is directly distributed to Japanese factories, it is not officially open to the market. According to the current situation, new wheat from various places is entering the market one after another, and it coincides with the arrival of ocean powder and old wheat ordered by Shanghai factories. It is difficult for the market to revive the old. It is predicted that the wheat market this year will rise after listing, because the environment is different from the past. As far as the current situation is concerned, there is no sign of improvement.

### Flour Arrives: 100,000 Bags of Foreign Flour, 60,000 Bags of Flour Exported

The trend in the flour market continues to stabilize. Local transactions are not particularly active. The "Shirai" ship, scheduled to arrive on June 1st with imported foreign flour, has now arrived in Shanghai, totaling over 100,000 bags. Market inventory is again abundant. It is heard that the Bat Brand has dropped to $4.35, and mid-range brands are only selling for $4.30 on exchange. With the new wheat season upon us, future flour prices are expected to remain low. Therefore, wholesale sales, except for slightly cheaper foreign flour transactions, have seen little demand for factory flour. Factories, fearing further price drops, are hesitant to move stock, and No. 2 flour remains at $4.40 on exchange. The 30,000-plus bags traded by local customers are unlikely to see immediate market growth.

Exports: On the 7th, 22,100 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin, 5,000 bags to Yantai, 30,250 bags to Shantou, and 2,000 bags to Xiamen. Additionally, 300 bags of bran were shipped to Xiamen and 450 bags to Hong Kong.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Sales More Active; Foreign Rice Prices Lowered to Clear Stock

Japonica Rice (Du Geng): Yesterday, various gangs delivered a total of 2,600-2,700 bags of Songjiang Gang No. 2, Cartwheel Baozi, and Kunli rice from river ports. The market remained stagnant with little change. However, the overcast and rainy weather slightly boosted confidence, and local sales showed some activity. Stockholders also engaged in some transactions. As a result, except for a slight increase in prices for lower quality rice, most rice prices remained unchanged.

Indica Rice (Ke Xian): Yesterday, local demand was strong, with total sales of over 3,000 bags, mostly for actual sales to shops and factories. Few stockholders inquired. Therefore, despite the weakening demand from Hangjia and other inland gangs, market prices actually rose by about $0.15. Inland gangs only traded about 1,000 bags, as inventories were not yet cleared after several days of strong sales, and inland prices had also returned to normal. Demand is likely to gradually decrease. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian are still selling actively, and the market is quite firm.

Foreign Rice: Large buyers are still absent, and warehouses are eager to clear stock due to the hot weather and approaching delivery of pre-ordered goods. The market is gradually softening. Yesterday, several dozen bags of Saigon rice were offered, and the price dropped another $0.10 to $18.80. Ling Yixing customers are still quoting $19.23, freight included.

Glutinous Rice: Yesterday, the market for Biang Yuan rice was sluggish due to high prices and competition from foreign rice. The market showed signs of flatness and fatigue.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Jiading New Broad Beans; Tianjin Gang Most Active

Yesterday was the second day of the new broad bean season. Besides a small amount of green broad beans, there was a significant influx of Jiading white broad beans. Although the Tianjin gang was actively buying, prices did not increase. Yesterday, over 900 bags of Jiading white broad beans were offered, with two-thirds bought by the Tianjin gang and the rest by local dealers. The price was $6.70, original price. The supply of new green broad beans was limited, so sellers held firm, with the highest price reaching $7.80, but only a dozen or so bags were sold. Total market sales yesterday were about 20 bags of Pailou Shi goods, priced at $7.40 to $7.50, and over 200 bags of Minhang goods, priced at $7.25 to $7.80. Besides local sales, several dozen bags were also bought by the Xiamen gang.

### Oil Cakes: New Rapeseed Oil Squeezing the Market; Raw Soybean Oil Holds Original Prices

Soybean Cake Futures and Spot Prices Parallel

Raw Soybean Oil: The raw soybean oil market has not seen much excessive change in the past two days. Sellers are unwilling to lower prices due to high costs and low profits. However, sales in various markets have decreased due to the availability of new rapeseed oil and the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. Yesterday, the market was in a sluggish state. Only 100 cans of Yantai canned peanut oil were traded at the original price of $10. There was no market for other soybean oils.

Soybean Cake: The June futures are being delivered by Japanese firms. The market is stable due to manipulation by strong stockholders. Some small short-sellers are covering their positions, leading to active trading. Yesterday, over 10,000 pieces of Yuanji June futures were traded at $2.82 to $2.83, and 5,000 pieces of miscellaneous brands were traded at $2.75. Although spot sales are slow, the price of this month's futures is higher than the spot price. So, spot prices rose by $0.03 to $0.04 under the support of holders. 1,000 pieces of Yuanji cakes were traded at $2.80, and 1,500 pieces of miscellaneous brands were traded at $2.74 to $2.75. Currently, futures and spot prices are parallel.

### Textiles: Cotton Cloth Futures Rise; Lun Chang Muslin Supply Cut Off; Demand for Local Eastern Textiles Increases Sharply

Domestic Plain White Cotton Cloth: Fine twill has been selling well recently, and merchants' inventory is gradually being depleted. Factories have opened orders for over 1,000 bales of June-July futures, priced about $0.10 higher per piece than the market, causing the spot market to tighten. Shenxin Fugu fine cloth is selling at a $0.10 premium, and Dapeng's quoted price has also risen by $0.10. The Wenzhou gang continues to buy strongly, trading 100 bales of 12-pound and 11-pound fine cloth. Dyed twill is selling well, and dyeing factories are actively buying, with nearly 100 pieces traded yesterday, with prices rising by $0.10 to $0.20 per piece. Wholesalers transferred 300 bales of coarse cloth to the local street, which were absorbed and resold to Eastern Zhejiang and Wenzhou. Local stockholders and wholesale retailers purchased 50-60 pieces of various grades of light and heavy coarse cloth from factories. Dealers from Northern Jiangsu bought over ten pieces of 9-pound coarse cloth, and the market is stable. Dyed cloth for customers in Wenzhou gang continues to be strong. They purchased 50 cases of dyed cloth, dyed twill, serge, straight tribute, and printed fabrics. Some customers in the Shantou gang have stopped loading, while others are still shipping as much as possible. Buyers from Sichuan and Yunnan have newly increased purchases, mostly dyed twill, totaling 2,000 pieces. Dark colors are holding firm, while light colors are mainly sold by retail shops due to seasonal factors, making the market quite chaotic. However, Lun Chang's non-fading muslin, linen, and printed fabrics are in high demand at retail, with daily sales of 1,000-2,000 pieces. Supply has been cut off due to the strike. Popular patterns are out of stock, and wholesale retailers are barely able to cope with demand.

Local Eastern Plain White Cloth: The market rose further yesterday due to continued strong dyeing and sales in the local street. Fine cloth prices vary in the spot market, resulting in stabilization, while next month's futures have uniformly risen by $0.05 to $0.10 per piece. Demand for fine twill has increased sharply, with both spot and futures rising by $0.10 to $0.15 per piece. Dyeing factories and colored cloth dealers purchased a total of about 5,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, and market sentiment is good with expectations of further price increases.

Exports: On the 7th, 85 pieces of textiles were exported to Tianjin, 15 pieces to Yantai, 14 pieces to Xiamen, 290 pieces to Shantou, 36 pieces to Hong Kong, 80 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 65 pieces to Beihai, and 95 pieces to Haiphong.

August futures were at 6 shillings and 9/8 points, December at 5 shillings and 9/8 points and 75, and March of next year at 6 shillings and 0.025.

### Allegations of Flag Misuse: Japan Protests to the United States; Wording More Moderate than Protests to Britain and France; Expresses Deep Regret Over Bombing of American Property

The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese authorities yesterday (5th) lodged a third protest with diplomatic and naval officials of third-party governments regarding alleged misuse of foreign flags by Chinese troops. According to a Japanese Navy spokesman, Counselor Morishima of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai delivered this protest to officials at the U.S. Embassy yesterday. Observers believe the wording of the protest appears more moderate than previous protests lodged with British and French authorities. It stated, in part, that the Japanese Naval Authorities

Regretfully Note

That since January of this year, Japanese naval aircraft have unfortunately repeatedly damaged American property, giving Americans the impression that the Japanese Navy disregards the property rights of third countries. In reality, the information provided by third-party authorities regarding the location of American property and all property of third countries, as well as other materials

Obtained Through Investigation

By the Japanese authorities, has been forwarded to the relevant air force units for detailed differentiation, and the location of third-party property is carefully studied before each attack to avoid accidental losses. It then listed various cases as evidence, concluding that, as can be seen, although Japanese naval aircraft attacks on Chinese troop positions are extremely careful, they inevitably cause

Accidental Damage

To nearby American and other third-party properties.

While the Japanese Naval Authorities are making every effort to respect American property, they would like to request that the U.S. authorities take appropriate and effective measures to prevent Chinese troops from building military positions and other military facilities near American property, and from using such property for military purposes.

### Lun Chang Old Factory Resumes Work Yesterday Morning; Labor and Management Reach Understanding; Conspiracy Fails – One Worker Arrested by Japanese Troops –

After the labor unrest at the British Lun Chang Spinning and Weaving Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, part of the workers at the Bailianjing Old Factory were instigated to strike.

As of press time, the shooting by Ding has not been confirmed. It is reported that Major Noya recently accused a Sikh sentinel of stabbing him with a bayonet. However, it is said that he had one hand on the bayonet at the time, and the sentinel naturally moved the bayonet away, resulting in a cut.

### Public Utilities Commission: Water and Electricity Rate Resolutions; Water Rate Discount Cancellation Extended for Six Months; Electricity Rates Allowed to Include Surcharge but Subject to Review

The Public Utilities Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Council held its first meeting of the year on the 19th of last month. Commissioner McDonald was elected Chairman.

Water Rate Issue

Regarding the water rate issue of the Shanghai Waterworks Company, the meeting resolved to approve the Waterworks Company's proposal that the water rate schedule remain unchanged for the time being and that the current practice (i.e., cancellation of the 20% discount) be extended for six months, at which time it will be reconsidered. This resolution has been approved by the Council Board. It is noted that the Shanghai Waterworks Company's recent business situation has shown considerable development, and the actual results for the second half of last year were better than those forecast in September of the same year. According to the Waterworks Company's letter to the Council, the current price increase is justified, but out of consideration for the difficult times, it is willing to extend the current arrangements for six months.

Electricity Rate Issue

Also on the 26th of the same month, the Commission held its second meeting to discuss the electricity surcharge issue. It resolved to approve the Director of Finance's proposal to allow the Shanghai Power Company to continue to collect the surcharge, but this measure may be reconsidered at any time. The actual surcharge collected by the Company in the past five months was lower than that which should have been collected according to the original calculation method, but the loss was smaller due to the increase in electricity used by users. In recent years, the Company's net profit, based on capital, has been lower than the net profit that can be collected under the business contract, especially in 1937 and 1938. Since December of last year, the Company could have collected a surcharge of 37.34%, but it did not increase the percentage to stabilize prices. The Council Board approved the Public Utilities Commission's recommendations at its regular meeting on the 31st of last month.

### Methods to Circumvent the Embargo: Provincial Governments to Handle Based on Circumstances

In order to adapt to the times and circumvent the embargo, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a telegram to the provincial governments stating, "After repeated research by the Ministry, for items other than the grains, salt, metal materials, coal, gasoline, and alcohol listed in the embargo list, the transporting merchants shall provide a reliable guarantee, which shall be verified by the Ministry, and a transportation permit shall be issued. At the same time, the customs shall be notified to inspect and release the goods at any time. In view of the interruption of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, it would be difficult to respond appropriately if each matter must be consulted on a case-by-case basis. It is necessary to handle the matter flexibly. The provincial governments are permitted to weigh the pros and cons and decide whether to prohibit or transport goods based on the actual situation at any time, so that goods can circulate smoothly and the social economy can be flexible. This is an essential task for the economic war." It is reported that the governments of Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces have complied with the regulations and are handling the review matters at any time.

### Rumors Rampant in Wusong; Ferry Services Suspended; Security Tightened; Large-Scale Searches

Rumors have been rampant in the Wusong area for days, and security has been tightened. Ferry services from the concession to Wusong, Yunzaobang, Zhoujiaqiao, and other places have been suspended due to strict security at the ferry crossings, and there are few passengers. The ferry from Gaoqiao to Wusong across the river has also been closed. Those who travel must detour through Zhabei by land, but the inspections along the way are very strict.

The Yulin News reports that Jardine Matheson's SS Suiwo and Butterfield & Swire's SS Wuhu sailed to Hankou last month carrying relief troops of the British Navy and civilian passengers. After arriving in Hankou, the SS Wuhu was intended to pick up the SS Wulin, which was trapped in the port. Yesterday (5th), the Japanese side announced to reporters that the SS Suiwo and SS Wulin, escorted by a British gunboat, had set sail from Hankou on Sunday, carrying naval personnel from the British gunboats in Hankou and some British civilian passengers and are sailing to Shanghai. A Japanese Navy spokesman said that 18 other third-party nationals, including 5 Americans, 2 Italians, 1 German, 1 French, and 9 White Russians, were traveling on two Japanese transport ships, which also departed from Hankou yesterday. The U.S. Consul in Hankou, Stephen, and the French Consul, Picot, were also among them. All passengers were transported to Shanghai because they had an absolute need to come to Shanghai and, with the exception of consulate officials, all agreed with the Japanese side not to return to Hankou.

### Investigation into Domestically Produced Goods; Halt the Abuses of Impersonating Domestic Goods; Table Filled Every Six Months

In order to protect domestic goods production and prevent the abuse of impersonating domestic goods, after issuing domestic goods certificates, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently been conducting more strict inspections to avoid mixing genuine and fake goods. It issued a special order to the provincial governments stating, "The Ministry's Rules for Issuing Domestic Goods Certificates were amended and promulgated in September of the 27th year of the Republic. However, the internal situation of the factories that have already received domestic goods certificates is constantly changing. If inspections are not carried out at any time, it will be difficult to verify the authenticity. The method of supervision is now determined as follows: (1) All factories that have received domestic goods certificates shall fill out a detailed table of matters once every six months and submit it to the Ministry for reference. The table format is the same as the table of matters to be provided when applying for a domestic goods certificate. (2) The completed table of matters shall be submitted to the local competent authorities for review and approval, or sent to a legally established industrial and commercial organization in the area for certification, before being submitted for approval. The certification procedures shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures for filling out and submitting the table of matters for application for a domestic goods certificate. Apart from instructing them separately, the Association is required to comply with and inform the Chinese factories that have received domestic goods certificates in various places to comply, fill out and submit the reports as required. This is hereby notified. Minister Weng Wenhao."

### Domestic Tea Approved for Shipment to Shanghai. Silk and Wheat Enter the Market in Succession. Abundant Spring Silkworm Harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Blocked from Transport to Shanghai. First Batch of Wheat, One Hundred Bags, Arrives in Shanghai.

Tea leaves, spring silkworms, and wheat from across the country are successively entering the market. Merchants are gathering capital to purchase them separately. Tea leaves, in addition to domestic sales, are being gathered for export from Hong Kong. Spring silkworms from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are being blocked from transport to Shanghai. The first batch of wheat has already arrived in Shanghai. Banks and firms are continuing to provide loans for tea, silkworms, and wheat, except in occupied areas. Details are as follows:

Tea

After the new tea from provinces such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hubei entered the market this year, foreign firms, local firms, and raw tea merchants all borrowed money from banks and sent personnel to the producing areas to purchase tea. There was a bumper harvest of tea in Qimen, Wenzhou, Pingshui, Huizhou, and other places. However, except for tea for domestic sale by local firms and raw tea, which is allowed to be transported to Shanghai for sale, foreign firms' tea, including black tea, green tea, and tea bricks, is all prohibited from being transported to Shanghai and is concentrated for export from Hong Kong. Tea factories in various places have been rushing to produce tea, and since May, exports of Chinese tea have increased sharply, exceeding a value of ten million yuan in national currency. As for the tea collected by Fuhua Company, it is limited to tea from foreign firms, because the Trade Commission has signed tea sales contracts with the Soviet Union and other countries, designating Hong Kong as the export port.

Spring Silkworms

Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are silkworm-producing regions. After the spring silkworms in various places entered the market, the cities were controlled and purchased by so-called "Central China Companies," while in the townships, manufacturers were allowed to purchase freely. Silkworm firms in various parts of Zhejiang have successively stopped weighing, and silkworm firms in Wuxi, Jiangsu, have already started weighing. However, manufacturers in Zhejiang who want to transport the silkworms they have acquired to the Shanghai concession area are being blocked by the Japanese. The manufacturers are currently negotiating with the Japanese. Silk factories in the concession originally planned to start production after the spring silkworms entered the market, but now they have been forced to postpone starting production because the new silkworms are being blocked from transport to Shanghai. Regarding the harvest of spring silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, improved varieties account for 80-90%, which can be considered a bumper harvest, while native varieties have a poor harvest. However, the total output of spring silkworms is higher than last year.

Wheat

Wheat-producing areas in China are widespread throughout the country, with Shanghai historically being a gathering point. Now, wheat from various places is starting to enter the market. Sample wheat from the Yangtze River area has already arrived in Shanghai. Manufacturers and grain merchants have separately sent personnel to purchase wheat. The first batch of new wheat, about one hundred bags, transported from Pudong and other places, arrived in Shanghai, with an asking price of about five and a half yuan. It is reported that there is a bumper harvest in the Jiangbei area this year, with an estimated output of four million bags. Flour mills in Shanghai, such as Fuxin and Fubu, are also preparing to purchase as much as possible, but with the principle of being suitable for flour milling. Foreign wheat previously ordered has already arrived in Shanghai one after another, totaling about two million metric tons. Now, because new wheat has entered the market, the import of foreign wheat has been stopped to prevent a large outflow of foreign exchange.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Brass Band Concert

The Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold a brass band concert at the French Park this month on the 7th from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM (weather permitting). The program includes seven items.

### Zhejiang Relief Association Approves Disaster Relief Measures for Air and Sea Raids. Simple Housing to Be Built in Frequently Attacked Counties. Relief Funds Not to Be Diverted for Other Uses.

(D) Instruct the provincial government to allocate 50,000 yuan to build simple houses in frequently bombed counties for the victims to live in, to be planned by the Relief Association.

### French Concession Promotes Traffic Safety Campaign. Pedestrians Must Walk Within the White Line. New Traffic Regulations on Avenue Dubail.

The French Concession authorities, to safeguard the safety of pedestrians, have specially ordered since yesterday the posting of red and green slogans in various important roads, cautioning pedestrians to be careful when walking. Also, at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Route des Soeurs, pedestrian lanes have been marked with white powder, and police have been stationed to advise pedestrians to follow the traffic light signals and walk within the white lines. Those who do not comply will be reprimanded. A notice has also been issued as follows: "In recent years, the population in the French Concession has greatly increased, and the number of cars, rickshaws, and pedestrians traveling on the roads has been increasing day by day. Unfortunately, traffic accidents have also been increasing. In 1938, 48 people died and 1,555 people were injured in traffic accidents. The number of accidents must be reduced urgently. To reduce the number of accidents, there is only one way: pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, coolies, carters, cyclists, and drivers must resolutely respect traffic regulations and obey the orders of traffic police. It is better to drive a little slower than to be the cause of an accident or the victim of an accident. Shanghai French Concession Police Department."

### Ningbo Port Temporarily Permits Fishing Boats to Enter and Exit.

The Ningbo Sixth District Commissioner's Office has ordered the Ningbo subordinate county governments, stating: "Regarding the case of fishing boats and sailboats leaving the port, we previously received two telegrams from Provincial Chairman Huang. We understand the original telegram. All fishing boats and sailboats should not be allowed to pass. We previously telegraphed the Chairman for instructions. The points raised in the report are indeed insightful. The situation is urgent. We have telegraphed Commander Guo to temporarily allow the fishing boats to be inspected and released, and instructed the Shipping Headquarters to issue passage flags and certificates according to procedures, and to report to Commander-in-Chief Gu for review. Please take note of this." "We have also received another telegram from Chairman Ke, relaying a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Gu, stating that fishing boats may be temporarily allowed to be inspected and released, and instructing compliance. This is for your information. This order."

### Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors Holds Farewell Reception for Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ford. High Praise for the Achievements of Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ford. Welcome to the New Secretary-General and Treasurer.

On the 5th of this month, the entire Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors and senior staff held a farewell reception at the Cathay Hotel for Secretary-General Fessenden and Treasurer Ford. Those who attended included former Chairman Arnold, former Director Marius, current directors (Chairman Fackling was unable to attend due to his departure from Shanghai), Secretary-General Philips, Deputy Secretary-General Corbitt, Hoetger, and Ishizuka, as well as the heads of various departments. During the reception, Deputy Chairman Keswick rose and delivered a speech, praising Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ford. At the same time, he extended a welcome to Mr. Philips, who also served as Secretary-General, and Mr. Moore, who was promoted to Treasurer. Former Chairman Arnold then gave a speech, expressing his respect for Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ford. The North China Daily News reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council held a banquet at the Cathay Hotel on the evening of the 5th to entertain the outgoing Secretary-General Fessenden and Treasurer Ford. A total of twenty-eight people, including the directors, attended the meeting. Chairman Fackling of the Municipal Council is now in Hong Kong, so Deputy Chairman Keswick presided over the meeting. Mr. Keswick said in his speech that this meeting was

A family banquet

He sincerely hoped that Ford would return to the Municipal Council in the future to help solve many difficult problems. Fortunately, although Fessenden has retired, he still wants to live in Shanghai. In the future, if the Bureau encounters difficult problems, it will consult him and receive his accurate answers. Keswick then

Took the opportunity to welcome

Philip and Moore, saying that the Bureau was fortunate to have Fessenden and Moore as successors. Both Fessenden and Ford must feel the same way. Keswick ended by expressing the Bureau's respect and gratitude to Fessenden and Ford.

### Japanese Prohibition of Customs Clearance Concerns the British Consulate. Carefully Considering Whether to Take Diplomatic Action, No News Yet. The US Consulate General Also Has No Comment on This Matter.

The Continental Daily News reported that on the 5th, it was learned that personnel at the British Consulate in Shanghai are carefully considering the Japanese rule prohibiting foreign ships from sailing to nine ports along the Yangtze River and the Chinese coast. It is said that they have received a detailed report from British shipping companies regarding this situation, but it has not been predicted whether they will take diplomatic action against this rule. At the same time, a senior official at the US Consulate General stated that the US Consulate General has heard nothing about this rule other than what has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Chinese sources reported that this rule was promulgated by a senior Japanese customs official without consulting the Commissioners of Customs, but this statement has not been officially confirmed.

Japanese Attitude is Tough

Dakwang News Agency reported that the reporter has been visiting the Jianghai Customs authorities for days to inquire about the handling of this case. However, the customs security is tight, so it is very difficult to interview senior customs officials. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, they went to the Customs again and interviewed Western and Chinese customs officers. As a result, it was said that since accepting the request of the Japanese Navy authorities, the Japanese Tax Commissioner has implemented the regulations of the Japanese Navy. Although it has attracted the attention of various countries, the Japanese Tax Commissioner's attitude is very tough. Commissioner of Customs Luford is currently exchanging views with various parties and has decided to set up regulations in accordance with the Customs Ordinance to try to crack down on this notice so that the Customs administration will not be disrupted.

Temporarily Change the Place Name for Customs Clearance

In addition to waiting for the governments of the various countries to take action to resolve the matter, foreign shipping companies are temporarily clearing customs according to the place names changed by the Customs in order to take into account the environment and maintain shipping. However, ships still stop at ports not listed on the customs declaration to pick up passengers and load cargo as usual. German and Italian ships are also doing the same.

The Purpose is to Control

According to reports from foreign shipping circles, the Japanese attempt to control Yangtze River shipping has developed from the Jiangnan line to the Jiangbei line. Taking the Beisha line as an example, Haimen Qinglonggang has become a base for the Japanese Navy and is its "special established area." All cargo shipments to rice have long been monopolized by the Nissin Company. However, apart from Qinglonggang, the Japanese are unable to control other ports. Cargo traffic at various ports is frequent, and foreign ships operate regularly, with prosperous business. Therefore, the Japanese conspiracy to covet the control of the Beisha line shipping industry has been brewing for a long time. After foreign ships are only allowed to stop at Qinglonggang, the traffic to other ports will be blocked, and cargo transportation will inevitably be concentrated in one port for entry and exit. It is expected that after the first step of the Japanese plan is realized, the Nissin Company will add more ships to compete for shipping. The second step plan will be to imitate the methods of the Hupu Changyinsha and other ports on the Jiangnan line and implement "removal permits" and other procedures to hinder the business of foreign ships. As for the coastal area, because the Japanese forces have not yet extended, Japanese ships cannot sail there. Seeing foreign ships sailing back and forth without interruption, they are drooling with envy, but they are unwilling to openly squeeze out foreign shipping companies to avoid directly causing diplomatic incidents and have to resort to the Japanese Tax Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs as a buffer. How can such base tactics hide the eyes and ears of the people of the world?

Niuzhuang Changed to Open to North China

The British Taikoo Company's Niuzhuang ship was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Fujian to Xiamen on the afternoon of the 6th, also calling at Wan, Xinghua, and Quanzhou. Now it is learned that due to the obstruction of the Shanghai Customs, the ship had to temporarily cancel its trip and is scheduled to open to Tianjin and Qingdao on the 8th. As for Funing, Sinyanggang, Haimen in Zhejiang, and other places in Jiangsu, it will also be difficult to resume navigation temporarily.

### Residents of Zhabei and Hongkou Refuse to Pay Exorbitant Taxes.

The exorbitant taxes that have been levied in various places such as Zhabei, Hongkou, and Yangshupu, such as the establishment of factories, workshops, opening shops and businesses, and retaining burnt-out houses, all have to be registered with the "Pseudo-Social Bureau" and pay various registration fees and donations. Recently, the so-called household registration tax and seasonal tax have also been levied on residents engaged in the above-mentioned industries. There are many items. Most of the residents who have moved to Zhabei are because the rent in the concession is too expensive and all other expenses are too high, and they cannot maintain their lives. They are poor people who have no choice but to move, and some cannot even find food, so they all refuse to pay.

### Refugee Vocational Training Center Planned in the Nanshi Refugee Area.

Gao Zhenxing, the principal of the Nanshi Refugee Area Children's School, because the school is facing environmental obstacles and it is difficult to continue opening, it has been two months. Although several negotiations have been made, there has been no effect. They have no choice but to give up the spirit of running education and shift to running a refugee vocational training center, located at No. 155, Fuyou Road, Mingguo Road, at the original school site. Technical personnel are hired to guide the refugees in learning skills. The organization preparation office has now started and is engaged in preparing everything. The matter is greatly related to the production of refugees, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide guidance at any time.

### Tung Oil Expert Talks About the Prospects of Sino-US Tung Oil Trade. US Tung Oil Planting is Gradually Improving, But Production is Still Limited. In the Next Few Years, It Will Still Rely on Chinese Supply.

Tung oil is a major commodity in China's export trade, and the trade volume between China and the United States is the largest. According to a certain expert who is familiar with the Sino-US tung oil trade issue, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the tung oil produced in China has been more difficult to export to the United States than usual due to transportation reasons. It is undeniable that as a result, when the war first broke out, the United States

Oil Prices Soared

As a result, the tung oil industry in the states along the Gulf of Mexico, such as Florida and Louisiana, tried to step up production. According to the early years of this century, the above-mentioned states began to plant tung trees and tried to operate the oil extraction industry for decades. To this day, although this oil industry has improved a lot, the production volume is still limited and cannot meet the large domestic demand. Therefore, in recent years, it still

Relies on China

And increases year by year, reaching its peak in 1937. It is estimated that in that year, the total amount of tung oil imported from China to the United States reached 175,000,000 pounds, while the amount produced domestically in the United States was the highest last year (1938), but it was only 4,000,000 pounds. The difference between supply and demand is indeed very large. Following this observation, it can be known that in the next few years, the

Tung Oil Market

Still needs to be purchased in large quantities from China, which is undoubtedly certain. As far as the American planting of tung trees is concerned, in the initial period, they did not know what kind of soil, tung tree variety, and climate humidity were suitable, so the losses were very large. In recent years, they have tried their best to research and have made great progress. The current oil price in the United States is completely dependent on the supply situation in China. In the past two years, due to the war, the oil price

Fluctuated Greatly

When the Japanese army occupied Shanghai in November 1937, the export of tung oil to the United States was interrupted for a time, and the US oil price soared to a huge amount of 22 cents per pound in US dollars. Later, because a large amount of tung oil was exported from Hong Kong, the oil price fell accordingly. Until about October last year, Guangzhou fell, and it rose back to 15 cents per pound. Since then, the oil price has fluctuated between 12 cents and 15 cents per pound. At present,

Chinese Tung Oil

The export has been changed to the Yunnan-Burma Road. The government actively encourages planting in the rear provinces and pays attention to refining to improve the quality. In short, the planting of tung in the United States is improving day by day. If China wants to maintain its original position, it should pay attention to improvement at any time.

### Three US Submarines Enter the Port for Defense.

The three US submarines No. 36, No. 38, and No. 40, after leaving port together the other day, continuously entered the three US destroyers No. 211, No. 127, and No. 219 yesterday morning, and were berthed at the No. 33 and No. 34 floating pontoons outside the Yufeng Yarn Factory in Yangshupu.

### The Pseudo-Police Bureau of Nanshi Takes the Pretext of Demolishing Church Houses. Attempt to Sell the Remaining House Materials at a Discount. Was Stopped by the French Priest in Strong Terms.

Most of the houses in Dongjiadu outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi are the property of Dongjiadu Catholic Church. After the Shanghai war, nearly five hundred buildings were destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in considerable losses. Recently, the pseudo-police sub-bureau of Nanshi, on the pretext of demolishing houses in various places in Nanshi and collecting bricks and tiles for sale, (investigated in May, the pseudo-city police bureau of Nanshi issued a notice stating that they were ordered to demolish the burned houses and sell the bricks and wood), but until this month, the pseudo-Nanshi District Public Office also issued a notice (allowing people to report the demolition of houses and the sale of bricks and tiles) because they were not allowed to share the profits. Seeing that the Catholic Church's remaining houses and walls had a large pile of bricks and tiles, they could not help but become jealous of the huge profits. Regardless of everything, they sent pseudo-police and ignorant workers to start working yesterday morning. Later, the French priest of the Catholic Church came out to stop them and refused in strong terms, because the property rights belong to the Catholic Church, and others should not move them without permission. Moreover, the remaining bricks and tiles can still be used to build new houses in the future. However, the pseudo-police were aggressive and limited the time to agree to their demolition of the bricks and tiles before leaving dejectedly. Later, the French priest stated that if there were no results, he would be forced to implement it and file a negotiation to maintain the Catholic Church's property rights.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Revises Regulations for Handcart Licenses. Effective July 1st.

### Although the Detained Portuguese Ships Were Allowed to Be Investigated, There Has Been No New Development in the Negotiations. Recovery of Freedom is Far Away. The "Viking" Ship Has Also Not Been Released.

The foreign ships detained by Japanese warships in the Zhejiang and Fujian waters, such as the Italian "De Pind," the German "Golden Temple," the Norwegian "Baud," and the Portuguese "Livorno," have successively gained their freedom and are operating on their original routes as usual. However, more than ten ships detained, such as the Portuguese "Mita," "Hailong," "Libao," "Rudema," "Maritang," "Beitang," and "Rudatangjiao," although the Portuguese Consulate has continued to negotiate with the Japanese, and the Japanese Consulate has allowed investigations, there has still been no new development as of yesterday, and there is little hope of release.

### Wu Song Market is Weak, Customs Sub-Card is Abnormally Busy, Strawberry Production is Quite Abundant.

Since the outbreak of the war in Wu Song, half of the houses in the whole town have been destroyed by artillery fire, and the rest have been demolished by the Japanese army due to the lack of fuel, causing the residents to suffer the pain of not being able to return. In addition, the Japanese army's inspection of passes in the military area is stricter than elsewhere, so residents dare not return home, and there is still no hope of market recovery. The people of Song who have fled outside have been waiting for nearly two years, and less than half of them have returned to Song because they cannot maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, except for dozens of shops selling daily necessities such as medical gardens, rice shops, and restaurants in the middle section of Songyu Road Street, the other streets are still a blank space, and business is very weak. After the customs sub-card Yasheng ship arrived in Song, it was berthed beside the wharf of the former Shidu Luntun on Waima Road. The shipowner is Japanese, and the deputy shipowner is Chinese. The ship has seven Japanese crew members and more than twenty Chinese crew members and sailors. Their duties are quite busy, including issuing certificates and registration books for entering and exiting civilian ships, printing and filling in shipside numbers, and collecting cargo taxes. However, there are very few cargo ships entering and exiting, only ice, fresh sand, gravel, firewood, Ningbo fishing boats, and local ships are not very common. However, many customs declaration firms have been opened. In addition to the original local firms, such as He Jinji, Xu Chengtai, and Sinsun, etc., there are more than a dozen, and Ningbo firms, such as Xia Senji and Penglai Public Office, etc., have four or five. There are also four new firms opened in Song by Shanghai firms: Gongji, Liyugong, Ankang, and Yu Yuxiang. Therefore, the competition in business is unusually fierce. Unscrupulous people use all kinds of despicable means, such as drilling and flattering, to establish connections. Villagers have changed from cultivating rice paddies to planting strawberries (commonly known as foreign plums), which are produced in large quantities and have already been marketed. Each load is sold for six yuan. There are two plum shops in Wu Song, Gongji opened by Zhou Lansheng and Xiangtai (also known as the Improved Foreign Firm) opened by Zhuang, which can collect hundreds of loads every day and transport them to Shanghai by truck for sale to make plum (western name for jam) sauce. It is said that these strawberries can be sold for more than twenty yuan per load in Shanghai, and the profits made by the distributors are very large. The production period of strawberries is more than one month. The two firms said that after the strawberries are harvested, water peaches can also be marketed.

Testified

About the situation of being defrauded and stolen. The court then questioned the defendant, who confessed his guilt. Therefore, Jiang Jianqiu was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for the crime of continuous theft as a recidivist, and three years of imprisonment for the crime of continuous fraud as a recidivist, with a total sentence of five years of imprisonment. The radio and other items were returned to Lu Meili, and the remaining stolen goods were redeemed by the owner at a price.

Unexpectedly, he had an argument with a vegetable vendor over the weight and market price, and then they started fighting. However, there were many vendors, and when they saw this, they ganged up on Wang, causing Wang to be outnumbered and beaten to death on the spot by many vendors. By the time the nearby police officers heard the news and arrived, Wang had already died. They immediately arrested two vendors as the ringleaders and escorted them back to the police station for interrogation. At that time, the vendors were still roaring and causing trouble for the police officers. Fortunately, a large number of detectives also arrived and suppressed the vendors.

A man from Zhenjiang, Hong Yonghai, although a neighbor residing at No. 16, Rong Shou Li, had no previous interaction with Yu. Yu still personally gave him an invitation, but Hong was unwilling to waste money on such meaningless social obligations, so he threw it away. When the date arrived, he did not send a gift or attend to congratulate, which infuriated Yu. On the 13th of the previous month, Yu led his accomplices, Shen Baohua, etc., to Hong's home to make trouble, severely beating Hong and his wife, Yang, causing injuries. Afterwards, Hong and his wife went to the forensic doctor's office to prove their injuries and filed a criminal lawsuit of assault against Yu and Shen with the First Special Court, requesting strict punishment according to law.

The agency's employee, Yin Qiu, stepped forward to stop them, leading to a conflict. Lu and others then left. Soon after, they invited more than 20 thugs, each carrying hatchets, iron bars, wooden sticks, etc., and swarmed into the agency, implementing their "smash the guide agency" policy, chopping anything they saw and hitting anyone they encountered, causing great chaos.

### Vienna Dance Hall Lawsuit; Defendant Acquitted

The Vienna Dance Hall on Avenue Haig, Jing'an Temple Road, was previously opened by Chen Zhanxiong under the name of Chang Ji Company. Later, due to the inability to develop the business, it was leased to the former owner of the Cathay Dance Hall, Chi Zhenmin, the former manager of the Ciro's Dance Hall, Xu Weizhou, and the dance troupe leader Zhao Zhongdi, etc., under the name of Xing Ji Company. They renovated it extensively and continued the business, but ultimately it closed down due to poor business. In January of this year, a man named Pan Sanxing, introduced by Xu Weizhou, leased the Vienna Garden Dance Hall from Chi Zhenmin of Xing Ji Company, renaming it Ji Ji Company. He placed an advertisement declaring the lease of all assets of the Garden Dance Hall, with a lease price of 20,000 yuan, with 4,600 yuan paid in advance. Unexpectedly, after the advertisement was published, Chang Ji Company came out in opposition, pointing out that Chi Zhenmin not only had no right to lease the property, but that the lease of the premises had also expired. Pan Sanxing of Ji Ji Company, believing that Chi and the other two had committed fraud, hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against Chi Zhenmin, Zhao Zhongdi, and Xu Weizhou with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing them of fraud. The defendants also hired lawyers Qian Zheng and Le Junwei to appear in court to defend them. Yesterday, Judge Dai announced that Chi, Zhao, and Xu were all acquitted.

Chen Futian, manager of Chen Fuji Transportation Company at No. 17 Guangdong Road, resides at No. 225, Lane 686, New Zha Road.

The letters were signed by the "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Anti-Traitor Group," stating that Chen was making a large profit by transporting goods on behalf of a certain party and should raise 5,000 yuan in legal tender to supplement the group's expenses. The letters instructed Chen to contact them in the Jinjiang Guanle, etc.

Teahouses in the French Concession.

After receiving the letter, Chen did not report it to the police station. Instead, he instructed his son-in-law, Yang Chuting, to contact them along with Liu Zhaobang and Wang Zhen, etc. Due to the inability to agree on the amount, no deal was made. Chen, fearing for his safety, dared not stay at home and temporarily sought refuge in Room 425 of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Wood Bridge. Unexpectedly, Chen's whereabouts were discovered by the gangsters, who sent someone to warn him again. Chen happened to be out at the time. One gangster wrote a note.

It is alleged that the Wan Chen Medicine Garden and its branches were established by the plaintiffs and defendants and Zhu Rongtian, etc., as partners, and have been operating peacefully until now. Unexpectedly, recently, the defendants appointed accountant Fei Zuyi to represent them in liquidation and took over all the goods. The plaintiffs, claiming their shareholding rights, published an advertisement in opposition.

### Accountant of Nanjing Texas Oil Company; Arrested for Embezzling Public Funds; Wanted by the Former Capital Court; Recently Arrested and Ruled on Jurisdiction for Further Trial

A local man named Jin Yushu (also known as Smith Jin) was employed as an accountant at the Nanjing branch of the Texas Oil Company. During his tenure, he continuously embezzled 10,000 to 20,000 yuan in public funds and disappeared without a trace. The Texas Oil Company reported the case to the Procuratorate of the Former Capital District Court, which issued a warrant for his arrest.

For Several Years

Jin's whereabouts were unknown. Until recently, detectives from the Old Gate Police Station arrested Jin and escorted him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen opened a criminal court to continue the trial. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that, after the postponement, the Texas Oil Company investigated and found that Jin Yushu had been continuously embezzling

Public Funds

from 1920 to April 24, 1936, totaling 24,350.30 yuan. After deducting 5,000 yuan that had already been returned by the defendant, 19,350.30 yuan was still owed. The police are now prosecuting him for embezzlement in the course of business under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The Texas Oil Company has prepared a detailed report of the audit in Chinese and Western languages. The defendant has

No Objection

to the report. However, the Texas Oil Company's head office is located in Shanghai, but the defendant's crime took place in Nanjing, and the plaintiff had previously filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Former Capital District Court, and the jurisdiction of that court is now occupied. Therefore, there may be a question of jurisdiction, which should be determined by the court ex officio. Judge Xiao, based on the Texas Oil Company's report,

Questioned the Defendant.

Jin answered that it was largely correct. Judge Xiao ruled that there was doubt as to the jurisdiction of this case and ordered an indefinite postponement, pending a request to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court to designate jurisdiction for further review.

The court ruled that the trial would be postponed for ten days and the defendant would be returned to custody. The victim was still sent to Guangci Hospital to treat the scars.

### Expectations for Contributors to the Supplement

— Shang Qing

We already know the importance of the editor's responsibility for a supplement. However, the establishment of a supplement cannot rely solely on the editor; it also requires contributors to provide articles. Furthermore, the editor's views are often influenced by contributors. Ultimately, the editor cannot act unilaterally and stubbornly. It is possible for a lone editor to single-handedly manage a supplement, or at most, to have two or three close friends who write for it, but this is abnormal and uncommon, and therefore not a good example to follow.

From this, it is evident that the importance of contributors to a supplement seems to surpass even that of the editor. Since I already have expectations for the editor, I cannot help but also have expectations for these contributors.

I hope they will choose the supplement they want to contribute to and not submit randomly. There are many supplements, and while their content and nature may be similar, there are also significant differences, or they may not align with your views, so you must pay attention. If you submit randomly and end up on the wrong path, especially if you submit to outdated, regressive, or even reactionary supplements, even if they publish your work and offer generous compensation, I don't think you would be happy! Furthermore, if you submit articles solely for the sake of compensation and only care about getting published, then I hope you will be careful with your pseudonym and not use the same one, so others cannot figure out what kind of writer you are.

I hope they will not follow behind others. If others are discussing topic A, do not also discuss topic A; if others are describing object B, do not also describe object B. Your subject matter should always be uniquely original and fresh, and you should not simply parrot others or write stale platitudes.

I believe that the universe is vast and human affairs are numerous, providing countless topics for writing and at my disposal. The saying "inexhaustible in supply" is an appropriate interpretation of this. As long as you are willing to pay attention at all times and in all places, and cultivate keen powers of observation, I guarantee you will find new and unique subject matter everywhere you look. (However, you must not be overly curious and get stuck in a dead end.)

I hope they will not cater to the editor's preferences. Contributors catering to the editor's preferences is probably the most common phenomenon. Some contributors do not seem to focus on improving the quality of their own writing but instead focus solely on researching the editor's tastes. This is wrong. As I said before, contributors can influence the editor's views. As long as your article is good, both in content and presentation, even if you have not catered to the editor's tastes, I believe a fair-minded and perceptive editor will not bury your efforts. At that time, you may even achieve overnight success. However, if the editor's views are indeed correct, contributors should not ignore them but should instead use various clever writing techniques to promote and enhance them.

I hope they will consider the environment. I say this naturally only applies to contributors on the current isolated island, because the isolated island environment is unique, and contributors need to be mindful. Otherwise, it will not only be futile but may also harm the newspaper. However, my intention in saying this is not so negative; on the contrary, I mean to say to consider it actively. We must not forget our current important task, resisting the war and building the nation. We must fulfill our responsibilities as writers, writing consistent articles on various topics and using various techniques to promote the movement of resisting the war and building the nation. I firmly believe that the pen of a writer is indeed omnipotent, and the oppression of a particularly harsh environment cannot prevent the emergence of particularly proactive articles!

In addition to these hopes, of course, I also hope that every contributor will not write trivial or accusatory texts, or any text that harms others without benefiting oneself, or even harms oneself. I think legitimate contributors are certainly well aware of these things, so there is no need for me to waste words.

However, my words above are addressed to an already mature contributor. By mature, I mean someone whose thoughts, insights, and writing skills are all above the average level. If I were to address an immature contributor—in other words, someone whose thoughts, insights, or writing skills are still very naive—I would have different expectations.

I hope such contributors will immediately stop submitting! I certainly understand their interest or their self-confidence. However, at a time when compatriots across the country are preoccupied with saving the nation, in my view, it is best for everyone to be able to use their strengths and directly devote themselves to the cause of national salvation. If you are not confident in your submissions, why waste your energy and resources? You can reserve your interests and self-confidence for after the victory, when the world is at peace, and slowly satisfy them then. As for some immature contributors who complain about their articles not being published, or blame fate and other people, accuse the editor of being blind or selfish, or repeatedly plead for their work to be published in the newspaper, I think this is especially undesirable. I hope that in addition to stopping immediately, they will also sincerely repent!

My expectations may make some contributors feel dissatisfied, saying that I am intentionally treating them unfairly. I hope they will recognize my sincerity: I have no other intention than to hope that they will have legitimate and outstanding development. Moreover, I myself am also a contributor, and I am using these expectations to encourage myself!

— Ming Zhi

—The Grandmother's Story—

"Hold on, hold on," the grandmother hurriedly stopped him. "I still have something to say to you: do you really think 'they' treat people well? Didn't you say before that you weren't necessarily treated well in 'their' place?"

"Before," Li Jingen sat down again, "I didn't think 'they' were good; since I was injured and 'they' treated me, I think they're good."

"You are truly muddle-headed! I'm just asking you: how did you get this injury?"

"..."

After this series of questions and answers, the grandmother explained that if "they" hadn't come, he wouldn't have been injured, and of course, he wouldn't need "their" treatment. "They" come, and we die, get injured, and those who don't die or get injured suffer a lot. "If they" didn't come, or came and left, never to return, we would have good days.

"Your words are very good," Li Jingen listened to the grandmother for a while, then nodded and said, "Why didn't I think of that earlier? How do you know so clearly?"

It's no wonder Li Jingen asked, because the grandmother is, after all, an old woman from the countryside. How would she know these things? After the grandmother told him everything, he suddenly realized and said, "Oh, so I fell for your trick and told you everything."

"You're wrong," the grandmother said with a smile, "you didn't fall for a trick; you did what you should have done. 'They' are the ones who were tricked, not you."

"Then what else do you want to know now?"

"Now, there's nothing I must know, but in the future, I will want to know some things that should be known."

She then pointed out a series of things she should know, that is, things he, Li Jingen, should report.

"As soon as you have news, tell Asen, and let Asen tell us, because you can't go far."

"Isn't that dangerous?" he hesitated.

"There is danger," the grandmother explained to him again, "but if it's done well, there won't be any danger. However, if you're afraid of danger and refuse to do it, then danger is destined to come to you and your family, think about it!" She said in a stern tone at the end.

"What?"

She told him that we have already noticed him, and have already noticed his family; she also told him that if no one is willing to contribute, everyone will be slaughtered and eliminated by "them" in the future...

"Even if you encounter danger over there with 'them,' we won't forget you. We will..." The grandmother said even more thoroughly.

"Okay, I will definitely listen to you!" Li Jingen patted his chest, making a final affirmation.

"Then I can go back tomorrow," the grandmother said happily, "do you have any letter to take back to your family?"

"No letter," Li Jingen stood up and said, "just say I'm doing well here." He stretched out his hand and said, "The shoes? Give them to me."

"I didn't bring them." The grandmother suppressed a laugh.

"What?"

"Your wife hasn't finished making them yet, understand?" The grandmother laughed.

"Understood, understood," Li Jingen also laughed. "Then I fell for your trick again."

As Li Jingen walked out the door, the grandmother suddenly grabbed him, pretending to be surprised and saying:

"What? Are you just leaving like that? You ate my beans, where's the money?"

"I didn't bring the money, understand?" Li Jingen was stunned for a moment, then also laughed.

Qian Asen heard this and also smiled knowingly.

Li Jingen limped away from them in an atmosphere of laughter.

### How to Renew the Spirit—Letting Go (6)

— Tang

Readers are probably already annoyed. How come the past five days have been about repentance and self-renewal? Are there no good aspects of our lives? Please do not misunderstand. Of course, we fully acknowledge that there are many, many admirable qualities in human nature, and at the same time, we cannot deny that there are still many areas that need to be developed. Before building, there must be some demolition work. Before a mansion is built, the old house must first be torn down, and many wooden and steel piles must be driven into the good soil.

We have now reflected on the past, and we must feel very sorry for having had so many spiritual or moral shortcomings. What should we do after reflecting? Should we send all these shortcomings into the "subconscious" and forget them? Psychologists tell us that doing so is very unhealthy and can cause various psychological disorders. The best way is to deal with them with a spirit of great courage. This coincides with Jesus' teachings. We should not only repent before God, but also clearly recognize all aspects of the relationship. After all this, you can truly let go of them and receive new life.

### After Translating "The Patriot"

— Zhu Wen

I have been a reader of Pearl S. Buck's works for a long time. I am often amazed that a foreign writer can observe our Chinese customs and manners so carefully and describe them so realistically. Even though there are still exaggerations and inevitable errors in her works, I believe that we should not be too demanding of a foreign writer. Since she won the Nobel Prize for Literature, I have been even more pleased with her success. Although there has been some criticism and surprise at Pearl S. Buck's Nobel Prize, I believe that the awarding of the prize is not a trivial matter; there must be achievements and reasons for her to deserve the prize, which we cannot doubt. Now I am even happier that I have become the translator of Pearl S. Buck's new book "The Patriot."

My motivation for translating "The Patriot" was extremely simple. One day, I found a copy of Pearl S. Buck's new book "The Patriot" in a Western bookstore. I briefly read the description printed on the book jacket and learned that it was a work depicting the trends in China during this era. Without asking whether it was good or bad, I immediately bought it back. I spent several evenings reading "The Patriot" from beginning to end and found it very moving; however, I had no intention of translating it into Chinese at the time. Firstly, because I was translating André Malraux's "Man's Hope" and had no time to translate another book; secondly, because I knew that such a good book would definitely be translated by someone, and there seemed to be no need to join in the fun. However, I ended up joining in the fun and starting the translation entirely due to the encouragement of several friends. One evening, I was having dinner with Mr. Ba Jin somewhere, and we talked about Pearl S. Buck's new book. I only expressed that such a famous work should be introduced to Chinese readers; and he immediately said that the task of translating and introducing it should be undertaken by me. Later, several other friends talked about it, and they all encouraged me to immediately start translating this new book. So, I "started work" on a long novel of more than 200,000 words, and it actually began to be translated into Chinese in my cramped room. Once I started, the progress was quite surprising. Utilizing my spare time every day, I translated quite a bit. Then, several bookstores contacted me, willing to accept the publication. Among these bookstores, I chose Wanye. My friends Tang Qifeng and Feng Xun were also interested in translating the book, but seeing that I was busy, they came to help me co-translate it. I am grateful to them; with their cooperation, this translation will be presented to the readers today.

The theme of "The Patriot" is extremely novel; it not only depicts the situation after the Northern Expedition but also depicts the dynamics after the War of Resistance Against Japan; it not only depicts the arduous struggle of China but also depicts the perfidious intentions of Japan. The story of "The Patriot" is also extremely complex; it not only depicts the raging revolution but also depicts the touching love; it not only depicts the disputes in Chinese families but also depicts the discipline in the Japanese army. And the characters in "The Patriot" are extremely broad; there are wealthy merchants, there are impoverished workers and peasants; there are disillusioned generals, there are revolutionary young masters; there are heroic fighters, there are shameless traitors; there are insightful maids, there are boring scholars; there are Japanese merchants, there are German ladies; there are White Russian drivers, there are American pilots... And what surprises us the most is that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is also one of the characters in the book; his words and deeds are directly described in the story; writing the Chairman as a character in a novel, I think this is probably the first time.

I think it is still up to the readers to criticize the quality of the original work. However, in terms of translation, I have always advocated following the original work as much as possible, but also making it as understandable as possible for Chinese readers (note, our readers are all Chinese!). No matter how great the original work is, if it is translated into Chinese that even Chinese readers cannot understand, I believe that the greatness of the original work will still not be revealed; on the contrary, that is such an insult to the author of the original work! However, limited by personal knowledge, there are inevitably inappropriate places; and once the printing process is completed, mistakes are inevitable, which is something I should apologize to the original author and the readers for.

Thank you to Mr. Feng Zikai, because he agreed to make paintings for our translation. I also thank the readers, if they can point out and criticize. (Auction Donation)

Spring and Autumn

### Air Force Warrior Fu Baolu

— Wen Xia

Before the War of Resistance, he worked at Hongqiao Airport. He starred in the movie "Sea Burial" during the National Games.

When the banner of the War of Resistance shone with an unusual light on China's five-thousand-year-old soil, young people with hot blood from all provinces and regions shouldered their rifles, braved the artillery fire, and marched to the front lines.

The songs of the War of Resistance resounded through every desolate village, and rusty rifles and bayonets were polished to a shine, flashing with fire.

At this time, people from all levels of society, men and women, enlisted in the military, especially intellectuals, who threw away their textbooks and rushed to the army.

In the sports world, many famous athletes, such as "Little Black Coal" Chen Zhenhe, pole vault king Fu Baolu, and Wang He, who won second place in the National Games pole vault, joined the Chinese Air Force to serve the country.

The joining of these famous athletes to the Air Force not only shows that outstanding members of the Chinese people are participating in the War of Resistance, but also shows that they are not only "sports stars" but also the most combat-capable members participating in the national War of Resistance.

Yesterday, this newspaper reported the sad news of Fu Baolu's death in the air battle in Guilin. We hope that this unfortunate news is just a rumor. Now let me tell readers a little about the daily life of this Air Force warrior.

Fu Baolu: Born with a head of brown curly hair, a thin face that appears very energetic, a small mustache on his lips, not very tall, but very strong.

His personality is very irritable, but unusually straightforward.

He grew up in Harbin. His father was from Northeast China, and his mother was Russian. His family also includes a younger brother and two younger sisters. Now his whole family is in Shanghai, running a ginseng store on Avenue Joffre.

Because of this, Fu Baolu not only speaks fluent Russian but also speaks fluent English.

If you don't know Fu Baolu's background, you will find a foreign flavor in him. Maybe you will guess that he is not Chinese. However, among friends or on the street, if someone carelessly says that he is Russian, he will get angry immediately and even resort to violence, or at least argue with you to make it clear that he is a Chinese from Harbin.

Fu Baolu likes to drink. After drinking, he is sometimes very rude, but his heart is very kind. Before the war, he worked at Hongqiao Airport. One day, he got drunk and drove a car, taking Jin Yan and many other friends, and drove to Hongqiao Airport at a speed of fifty or sixty miles per hour. On the way, he almost collided with another truck, scaring everyone in the car to almost scream.

He once married a very beautiful Russian wife, but later the two separated. He often thinks of his foreign wife when he gets drunk, shedding tears nervously. When he wakes up, his friends shame him.

During the National Games, Wang He wanted to compete with Fu Baolu for the top spot in the pole vault. That night, Wang He tossed and turned, unable to sleep. (He once returned to Shanghai, and is now back in the Air Force.) But Fu Baolu still won the top spot the next day. In fact, Fu Baolu didn't practice very hard. Some people say that if Fu Baolu could work a little harder, he wouldn't have been "unnamed" in the World Games.

Fu Baolu also tasted the flavor of movies. At that time, Wang Bin was at Tianyi Film Company and wrote a script called "Sea Burial," and decided to invite Fu to star in it, along with Liu Liying and others.

At that time, Fu Baolu was indeed very busy. During the day, he attended the National Games, and at night, he filmed "Sea Burial." Later, this film was screened at the New Guangda Theater before the National Games even ended.

After the Chinese army withdrew westward, he left Shanghai. Unexpectedly, such unexpected bad news came. We can only wish that this Air Force warrior is still safe and sound.

### Pigeon Diseases and Their Treatment

— Zhang Wende

Pigeon Pox

(Infectious disease) Initially, small lumps appear, gradually swelling up like warts. Quickly cut off the affected area from the root, apply carbolic acid water, and then apply ointment.

Wasting Disease

(Infectious disease) This disease is only seen when pigeons suddenly become thin. After three or four days, they are completely unable to fly. When you see this, you should quickly isolate the sick pigeon from the healthy pigeons and give it garlic juice to drink.

Thirst Disease

Drinking dirty water and bad food can be treated by giving them very strong chili water to drink.

Wing Injury

When two pigeons fight, and their wings are injured, iodine can be applied. There are two types of lice: long lice and round lice. The former hide on the wings, and the latter live on the pigeon's neck. Insecticide powder can be sprinkled on them twice a day without interruption. If there are also traces of lice in the pigeon loft, kerosene can be used to kill them, and then a layer of white lime can be spread.

Cholera

If a pigeon is infected with this disease, there is a risk that the entire flock will be wiped out in a short time. Hold the pigeon's head down and its body up, and gently press the crop with both hands, so that water flows out of its mouth. Quickly isolate it from other pigeons, and mix cod liver oil with wood oil to form a medicine, and pour it into its mouth. Carbolic acid and tincture of gentian can be added to the drinking water of other pigeons.

Hatching Young Pigeons

After the male and female pigeons are paired, when the laying period is approaching, the male and female pigeons work together to pick up rice straws and feathers. It is best for the pigeon keeper to add tobacco stalks and stems to prevent parasites. Before laying eggs, the female pigeon is mentally depressed, her feathers droop, and she appears to be sick. She stays in the nest. After three days, she lays the first egg. The male and female pigeons then take turns incubating the eggs. One day later, she lays the second egg. After that, from morning to 3 pm, the male pigeon incubates the eggs, and from 3 pm to evening, the female pigeon incubates the eggs. After 17 days of incubation, the chicks break out of the eggs. After a week, their feathers are fully grown, and after a month, they can leave the nest to find food and fly.

Homing Pigeon Training

To make pigeons into messengers and communicators, they must be trained. First, make the pigeons familiar with the pigeon loft, and use a signal when feeding them, such as blowing a whistle, whistling, or calling the pigeons into the room, and feeding them delicious food and clean water, to develop the habit of recognizing the pigeon loft. The next morning, let the whole flock of pigeons try to fly for ten minutes, once in the morning and once in the evening, gradually increasing the time. Then, train young pigeons, one-year-old pigeons, two-year-old pigeons, three-year-old pigeons, and experienced old pigeons over four years old separately. After the flying method is pure and hot, take them to a place near the pigeon loft and release them one by one to return. Then, gradually increase the distance between the pigeon loft and the release point, and gradually eliminate inferior pigeons. Pigeon release methods can be divided into: individual release, sequential release, and simultaneous release. Individual release means releasing one pigeon at a time, and releasing the second pigeon after the released pigeon is out of sight. Sequential release means releasing the first pigeon while the previously released pigeon is still in sight. Simultaneous release means releasing all the pigeons in the cage at the same time. Before 1937, the Nanshi Confucius Temple Zoo also had a homing pigeon association. Every month, the homing pigeons of each member were taken to Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing and other places for competitions. The excellent ones were champions and could receive banners and certificates from government officials.

Releasing Pigeons

Bad weather such as rain, snow, strong wind, and heavy fog will severely affect the flying direction. Regardless of the length of the flight, they should be given sufficient water to drink. (The end)

### A Record of Guan Liang

— Wen Zhaotong

——Overture to Guan Liang's Art Exhibition——

When Guan Liang is mentioned, an impression immediately arises in my mind: he is a man of few words, calm, and possesses the style of a pure artist.

Indeed, Guan Liang is also a cultivating gardener in the field of Chinese new art. He is a senior Western-style painter who studied painting in Japan very early on. After returning to China, he successively served as a professor in art schools in Shanghai, Wuchang, Guangzhou, and other places. His paintings have always advocated the integration of Chinese style. Because merely imitating some Western techniques, applying some Western materials, and even adopting subject matter commonly used in Western paintings, although able to grasp the sense of space, the soul of plastic arts, it is, after all, not one's own thing.

Therefore, Guan's paintings possess a free and refined style, while also being filled with the charm akin to literati paintings, that subtle tone, elegant and light colors, that unrestrained brushwork, often employing oriental themes, sparsely and effortlessly expressed. This kind of expression integrates the techniques of Shi Tao and Bada Shanren. This purely Chinese artistic style, in the Chinese art scene where there are either conservative and stale academic styles or imitations of the styles of certain paintings or the brushwork of certain individuals, is indeed extremely fresh.

If we carefully observe the evolution of Guan's style, his early works were naturally greatly influenced by Cezanne. This is a common phenomenon among modern writers, so his expression is very solid and calm, without any emptiness or superficiality. The texture, scenic impression, and sense of space of the object are, of course, sure to be grasped. At the same time, Renoir, known for depicting gorgeous and charming bodies, also had a significant influence on him.

In recent years, he has not been complacent and stagnated within a narrow scope. He still constantly devotes himself to creation, tirelessly seeking influences for the advancement of his art. Therefore, Guan's works, in terms of area, are not very large, the colors tend to be calm and serene, the themes are just some landscapes, figures, still lifes, the composition is not grand, and the brushstrokes are not bold, but he can express a light melody from ordinary and simple objects, capture the emotions hidden within nature, and from low houses, small trees, slanted telephone poles, flowers, fruits, girls' faces... express a latent and rich poetic meaning. This poetic meaning is not literary, nor is it a kind of poetic meaning caused by the requirements of philosophy or social science and other subjects.

Note: Guan's art exhibition is scheduled to be held from the 8th to the 11th of this month in the Grand New Company.

### The Concubine Greets

— Fo

Yesterday I saw in the newspaper that someone named Chen from the Jingwei faction went to Beiping to smooth things over with the Wang Kemin puppet organization. Also, the day before yesterday, the newspaper reported that Wang Kemin of the Beiping puppet organization and Liang Hongzhi of the Nanjing puppet organization opposed a certain movement by Mr. Wang, etc. In that case, it is indeed appropriate for Wang Jingwei to send his trusted henchmen to greet everyone.

Anyone who becomes someone's concubine must first greet others. The first concubine must greet the first wife; the second concubine must greet the first concubine; the third and fourth concubines must greet the first and second concubines. Because those who enter the temple gate first are considered greater by three days. Otherwise, I will either give you the cold shoulder or give you a hard time. Not being jealous is not becoming of a concubine. A concubine's jealousy is the true nature of a concubine.

Wang came from a famous family and is now old, but she is acting as someone else's concubine, greeting a bunch of demons and monsters. Wang looks at herself in the mirror, how does she feel? Looking back on those years, what are her thoughts?

### After the Rain, Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Eleven: Recognizing Hometown Acquaintances, the Old Life of Pestle and Mortar; Attaching to Power, the New Aristocracy of Official Hats and Sashes

These two conditions were what her father, Rong Peiying, had been considering all night and would decide on tomorrow morning. Poor Pan Peiying cried all night, racking her brains and realizing that she had to obey the first condition. Because if she didn't, Zhao Letian's life would be in danger. Her father meant what he said and would do what he said. He could really notify the military police and send a few military police to arrest him and shoot him. People would just think he had disappeared and wouldn't even know. Moreover, we are clearly irreconcilable with him. Could he marry the daughter of a _? Even if he was willing, people wouldn't agree to it. Our family would never allow a guerrilla fighter to be our son-in-law. There isn't just one person in this puppet government, and they are constantly fighting each other. At the very least, they would say that you are connected to the guerrillas. Can you bear that accusation? However, Peiying thought: I should write this reply a little more gently. In his letter, he told me to persuade my father. I can tell him in detail that I can't persuade my father. In his letter, he wanted me to leave my family. I can tell him that I can't leave now. But this letter of mine will definitely be checked by my father before it can be sent out. I definitely can't write a lot of rambling nonsense; nor can I tell him all my difficulties. I can only briefly reply to him for now according to my father's wishes, and then think of a way later. The first thing is to save his life, and not sacrifice it in vain. If I cling to him to death, it will only end up harming him, which is something that people will regret. Therefore, this letter of hers had no _ intention, but it did have a sense of resolution. She simply said: We now have different goals, so you don't need to write any more letters, which would be too verbose. Even if Ran has letters, I won't reply to them. Peiying thought that if Zhao Letian was a smart person, he would definitely be able to guess that I was not a free person. Because these words, at first glance, are not what I usually say. Then, wouldn't he understand after reading this letter? I can write to her again in the future, explaining that the letter I wrote last time was not of my own volition, but was written under duress. Moreover, I can also tell him that at that time, it was a matter of life and death. They already knew your address and could send military police to arrest you, so I had no choice but to write this letter. Therefore, Peiying deliberately wrote this letter in an extremely cold manner, which was completely different from the tone she used to use when corresponding with Zhao Letian. This letter would naturally be checked by her father before it could be sent out. Her father was very satisfied when he saw that she had written it in a very cold and decisive manner. He said that she had come to her senses and that it was not worth it to associate with these young people. But he was also secretly wary, afraid that she would correspond with Zhao Letian again, so he blocked their communication line. (130)

### Concerning the Startling Theatrical News

— Ti Gong

Since this column published the startling theatrical news from the Mei Hua Guan host, I believe the entire isolated island must be greatly stirred. Just taking the hundred or so colleagues at my place as an example, because I am relatively close to the theatrical world, they have all been asking me to find out if it is true or false, preparing to send congratulatory gifts. Previously, Mr. Zhang Shankun's father's birthday performance was a huge lie on April Fool's Day, causing thousands of theater fans to rejoice in vain. However, the host never likes to joke, and besides, yesterday, June 6th, was Teacher's Day, which could also be considered a foreign dog bathing festival. It doesn't seem like there are any regulations allowing lying, so I couldn't help but call the host. As a result, he seriously replied that I am not talking nonsense and guaranteed that the check would be cashed. With such a definite guarantee from him, I am indeed a bit greedy for this astounding check.

However, I am still a bit skeptical. Based on my observations, first, I can decide that Shuyan will not come. The simplest reason is that if he comes, he will be letting down several famous people in Shanghai who previously invited him and were rejected. Second, Lanfang will definitely not come either, because once he comes, it will be difficult to get rid of the feeling of "becoming Feng Fu again." Third, according to someone familiar with the Feng family's background, the Feng family's third daughter's given name is not Biqi. This Biqi is actually the nickname of Feng Sixth Master's concubine. Anyone who knows Sixth Master calls her Bishi because of this. Because of these points, I would like to ask the Shanghai Zhou Lang to not congratulate too early. It is better to believe that it is not true than to believe that it is true. If it really comes true by the deadline, wouldn't that be a pleasant surprise?

No matter what, just reciting this playbill three or four times is already quenching my thirst by looking at plums, enough to be considered chewing when passing a butcher's shop.

(Editor's Note) What Ti Gong said is indeed correct. Yesterday, the number of phone calls from the outside world asking about the truth was truly overwhelming, which shows how excited the Shanghai opera world is. As far as I know, this show is being actively prepared. The general director in charge of rehearsals is a well-known amateur opera enthusiast in Shanghai. He originally wanted to postpone the announcement, but we disclosed it first, so it's no wonder everyone is so surprised. As for the three-day program and actors, I dare say it won't be that far off. The magazine will continue to report on future developments truthfully. Please pay attention, readers.

### The New Movement of Movie Stars in Movie City

Chest Enlargement and Hip Enhancement—Fashionable for a Time

—An Unconventional Fitness Method

Hollywood beauty expert Jim Davise has recently invented exercises for chest enlargement and hip enhancement. These two exercises are currently fashionable among Hollywood female stars. Dorothy Lemour and Janet Waldo are among the most enthusiastic participants.

According to Davise's secret, the movement to develop the chest is very simple. Whether you are sitting or standing while practicing, just raise your arms and bend your elbows, placing your wrists one foot in front of your chest. When gently touching each other with your fingers, you should feel your pectoral muscles expanding. Doing this, 40 times a minute for two minutes a day, according to Davise's experiments, if you continue to do it without interruption, your chest will develop after two months, because the development of the pectoral muscles can support the height of the breasts.

As for the wonderful method of hip enhancement, Davise also has a secret, with instructions as follows: Hang a rope from the ceiling so that the end of the rope is 18 inches above the ground. If you think this is too much trouble, you can use a chair with a back to replace it. Preparation posture: first lie down on your back, hold the rope or the back of the chair with both hands, raise your head and neck, and also raise your feet together, making the head and feet about six inches above the ground, with the center of gravity concentrated on the buttocks. Once this preparation is complete, you can begin the movement: first try your best to turn your feet to the left, and then turn to the left again, moving back and forth. Do it ten times on the first day, twelve times on the second day, and so on, until you can turn it 50 times a day, then stop increasing the number of times. After three months, a full effect of hip enhancement will naturally be achieved.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

Family Misfortunes Abound, Ju Peng Follows in Da Tou's Footsteps and Enters the Priesthood

Strangely enough, not only did she not feel pain, but she laughed, scolded, and cursed, hitting anyone she saw, and didn't stop for two days and two nights. When Ju Peng saw his eldest daughter in this state, he realized that she had suffered a great deal of stimulation on her nerves, so he had to send her to a mental hospital. He also heard people say that the house was unclean and had evil spirits, so he believed it and moved with his other three children to the Litong Hotel in Dongjiaomin Lane. He stayed there for a long time, and each day, including food and lodging, cost him ten yuan. At the same time, the hospital also needed money. This went on for more than a month, and the eldest daughter's illness was only fully recovered. The whole family moved back home. Ju Peng had already lost a lot of money to form a troupe. Coupled with these unexpected expenses, the total was nearly a thousand yuan, and almost all of the funds were used up. The loss of money was secondary. What made him feel most aggrieved was that he considered himself a successor of the Tan school, but his son Shaopeng insisted on studying Ma Lianliang to death. Whenever he had a play, Shaopeng refused to listen. As long as Lianliang had a play, he was willing to pay to buy seats in the first two or three rows to enjoy the play. After the play was over, he would go home and imitate and practice Ma's singing style and performance style. Ju Peng was so angry when he saw this situation. One day, I was chatting with him, and he sighed and said: "Yan Ju Peng's son insists on studying Ma Lianliang. He doesn't want to learn from me, a real Tan school laosheng, and he insists on learning from these juniors. Isn't that strange!" After listening to his words, I tried to comfort him: "You must know that young people generally have a concept of loving beauty. Everything should be beautiful. Lianliang's popularity lies in the word beautiful. Who is like you, with a sparse and short beard and broken and old costumes? The white arrow shirt in "Lianyingzhai" is soaked in sweat, red in one area and purple in another, but you still wear it on stage. In your opinion, I am learning from the old Tan. The former boss Tan valued art over costumes." (30)

### Renji Medical Clinic

The Shanghai Renji Medical Clinic uses Western methods to treat Chinese people. This clinic has been operating widely for a year. According to statistics, last year, 516 patients stayed in the clinic, and 12,378 people went to the clinic to obtain medicine. In addition, a separate bureau was set up in the city for vaccination. Last year, 2,558 children went to the bureau, which is more than in previous years. But what is regrettable is that the Chinese people do not believe in this method, and those who believe in planting large flowers are still a large group. This clinic is well-known at home and abroad, and it has been for more than a day. The various patients who are treated come from far away in the inland, and some have taken Chinese medicine without recovery. Recently, the number of patients has been increasing, and the hospital buildings are narrow. It is planned to rebuild a new hospital on the old site, so that it can accommodate everyone. So far, a total of 3,108 taels of silver have been donated for this project. Magistrate Zeng donated 100 taels, Baogzhuang Guild donated 500 taels, Tea Guild donated 300 taels, Yangbu Guild donated 200 taels; and one anonymous person, because his relative's illness was cured by the clinic, donated 250 yuan in foreign currency. The director of the clinic is a doctor named Ya Gu, and his assistant is a Chinese gentleman named Huang; there is also a Western doctor named Han, who also helps with treatment from time to time.

### Giant Carp in Wusong

I passed by the mouth of Wusong and saw several fishing boats, surrounded by small boats on all sides, with incessant clamor. Upon inquiring, I learned that a fisherman had just raised a net, which was very heavy, and he could not lift it by himself. He then called several people to lift it with force, and it turned out to be only one carp. Upon weighing it, it weighed 113 catties; there was a copper plate attached to its fins. There were inscriptions on the plate. Upon examination, it was found to be a fish released by a certain Mr. Kangxi in the Kangxi period. Later, a guest spent two ocean coins to buy it and put it back into the water. This fish has been around for more than 200 years since the Kangxi period. Now that it has been caught by the fisherman, it must be a catastrophe. Fortunately, it met a benevolent person and returned to the sea, so that it would not be injured. It is the spirit of the fish, and it is brought to it. Published tomorrow A Record of the Audience
