### Bai Chongxi Discusses Factors Contributing to Victory in Northern Hunan; Strategic Success Inflicted a Major Blow on the Japanese; Military-Civilian Cooperation Strengthened Belief in the Inevitable Victory of the War of Resistance

Location Undisclosed: Bai Chongxi discussed the two main factors contributing to the victory in northern Hunan, stating that celebrating National Day coincided with the unprecedented victory in northern Hunan, annihilating tens of thousands of enemy troops. This victory was not accidental or a fluke but a concrete result of two years and three months of struggle by our entire nation's military and civilians. This proves that we are indeed growing stronger with each battle, while the enemy is growing weaker. It also proves that we have reached the stage of turning defeat into victory, while the enemy has fallen into a state of collapse. Why were we able to achieve such remarkable gains? The first factor is our strategic success. Previously, we were often in a passive position, allowing the enemy to run rampant. Now that we have seized the initiative, we can afford to wait for the enemy to tire and use our strength to control the enemy's movements. After luring the enemy deep into our territory, we used ambush tactics to attack from both sides, preventing the enemy from coordinating their front and rear and rendering their left and right wings unable to reinforce each other. Moreover, we thoroughly destroyed railways and highways in advance and implemented a scorched-earth policy. As a result, the enemy not only could not use their mechanized units but also felt as if they had entered a desert. With the enemy's tricks for winning exhausted, we unleashed the power of our attacks, inflicting a fatal blow. The second factor is our ability to achieve military-civilian cooperation. Because of military-civilian cooperation, the enemy could not use local ruffians and traitors to cause trouble after penetrating deep into our territory, and they encountered countless obstacles everywhere, creating a state of extreme anxiety. As a result, they were defeated in a rout. These two points are what we should particularly recognize regarding this victory. In commemorating the Double Tenth Festival today, the unprecedented gains in northern Hunan have naturally increased the public's belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance. However, we should know that this is only the beginning of victory. The enemy has suffered a major blow and may try to stage a comeback for a final struggle. Therefore, while we should rejoice and be encouraged, we must not become complacent. Instead, we should carry forward the tragic and solemn revolutionary spirit to drive out the enemy and complete the unfinished task of the Xinhai Revolution in the shortest possible time. (10th dispatch)

Chongqing: According to Yang Xuancheng, Director of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff Headquarters, the great victory of the Chinese army in northern Hunan had three key elements: (1) The Japanese troops advancing south were cut into countless unconnected fragments after the Chinese army's multifaceted counterattacks. (2) All highway transportation in the war zone was systematically destroyed by the Chinese, so the Japanese army had no means of resupplying food and ammunition after entering, and heavy artillery could not be used. (3) During the operation, the people in the war zone did their utmost to assist the Chinese army. According to Mr. Yang, the Japanese army's casualties in the northern Hunan campaign were certainly over 30,000, while Chinese casualties were also over 20,000. (Associated Press, 10th)

### Xue Yue Formally Appointed Commander-in-Chief

Since this great victory in northern Hunan, his command and adaptability have been highly appropriate, so he has been formally appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth War Area. Previously, this position was held by General Chen Cheng, but General Chen's other work became too demanding, so General Xue Yue took over the position. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)

The remaining Japanese abandoned military supplies and fled in disarray north of the Xinqiang River. The Chinese army is pursuing them across the river, achieving an unprecedented victory. This campaign not only safeguards the security of Hunan Province but also shatters the Japanese dream of connecting the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and invading the southwest. It is the prelude to the overall War of Resistance and the recovery of lost territory. Please inform all Hunanese people in Chongqing of this. Xue Yue. (11th dispatch)

Editorial

### Explanation of the Trend of Establishing a Ministry of Trade in Japan

In recent days, while Japan has suffered unprecedented defeats in Hunan and Jiangxi in China, abnormal political trends have emerged within its own country. The cause is that the Japanese government, in a cabinet meeting on the 3rd of this month, approved the establishment of a Ministry of Trade. According to this new plan, on the one hand, there is a change in the cabinet structure, that is, a new ministry is established in addition to the existing ministries; on the other hand, the various bureaus and sections related to foreign trade in the current ministries of the cabinet must be merged into one. The Commerce Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also included in the merger. As a result, all officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, using the demand for the implementation of the unification of diplomacy as an excuse, threatened to resign en masse. Therefore, they expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the new Foreign Minister Nomura for supporting the establishment of a Ministry of Trade in the cabinet meeting. According to Tokyo dispatches in recent days, the severity of the situation not only has a tendency to force Foreign Minister Nomura to resign, but may even affect the implementation of the Abe cabinet and national policy.

The so-called unification of diplomacy means that modern international diplomacy must emphasize both politics and economics, that is, international politics and economics must be integrated into one furnace to be meaningful, powerful, and capable of development. Therefore, the Commerce Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be one of the pillars of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Originally, Japan's foreign trade was one of the main factors in building modern Japan and also a pillar supporting Japan's national strength. Both the government and the people know that this is their economic lifeline. However, the administration of Japan's foreign trade has always been divided among various ministries in the government: for example, trade management belongs to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, overseas commercial administration and personnel belong to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and tariffs, foreign exchange, and shipping belong to the Ministry of Finance. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Ministry of Interior has also been responsible for supervising and controlling trade under the economic police system in order to strictly control trade. In addition, the control of export products by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the part of colonial commerce handled by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs are also related to foreign trade. Such decentralization of administrative power sometimes inevitably leads to contradictions and overlaps. Japanese administrative reform theorists have long been dissatisfied with this situation. They once proposed the establishment of a Ministry of Trade, but it was ultimately not realized due to the relationship between the duties and rights of various departments.

Now Japan's foreign trade has entered an extremely dangerous period. The decline in Japan's trade figures in recent years is well known, and the current international environment makes the Japanese government uneasy. As a result of its loud declaration of "creating a new order" in East Asia, people in various countries in Europe and the United States spontaneously boycotted Japanese goods, and the movement to oppose the export of military raw materials to Japan is gaining momentum. It is said that the United States has notified Japan that it will abolish the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation from January next year. In the general trend, Japan's foreign trade is obviously about to encounter major difficulties. For example, 80% of raw silk, which Japan considers to be its main wartime export product, is sold to the United States, accounting for one-third of the trade in goods exported to the United States. However, Japan also relies on the United States for most of the oil, cotton, copper, and iron it needs. If the United States restricts trade with Japan from next year, this will be a fatal blow to Japan's overseas trade. In addition, with the recent outbreak of the European War, the Japanese originally hoped to take this opportunity to open up some new markets. However, things did not go as planned. In addition to being constrained by the war in China, the wartime economic countermeasures of the British and French colonies also adopted the same steps as their home countries, Britain and France. For example, British Malaya in Southeast Asia recently banned the import of 34 commodities from non-sterling countries, including many commodities that have historically been imported from Japan in large quantities. Japan's foreign trade will not only fail to gain opportunities for development due to the European War, but will also have the possibility of continuing to decline. The Japanese government felt that it was difficult to handle and was at a loss, so in order to save this crisis, it first adjusted its internal structure, and then decided on the Ministry of Trade, preparing to centralize the power of trade administration and avoid various realistic diplomatic problems with various countries, and to independently open up a way out for trade. It is too early to say whether the Japanese government's attempt can achieve anything in the inseparable state of international political economy. However, great waves have arisen internally because of this!

It is nothing less than strange that members of a department under the jurisdiction of the cabinet opposed the cabinet's decision and caused a political storm. Perhaps in Japan, due to years of external aggression and internal assassinations, discipline has been lax, and such strange things have been taken for granted. Further observation reveals that the opposition of officials of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the establishment of a Ministry of Trade is nothing more than a struggle for vested interests among various departments and factions, and in fact it is not worthy of much attention. As a result, it is very likely that the subordinate officials will find a plausible way to turn around and change course. If not, the cabinet, in order to maintain the government's only prestige, may have to act ruthlessly and make some sacrifices to eliminate this storm.

Japan's problem of setting up a Ministry of Trade is a portrayal of the current situation in Japan: her more than two years of hard fighting in China have revealed a very anxious attitude, so that she cannot hide her impatience and recklessness in politics. The repeated reorganization of the wartime cabinet is one reason, and the plan to establish a Ministry of Trade is also one reason. As for officials opposing the government's national policy, this is also an exposure of this state of unease. Many foreigners who have traveled to Japan believe that the Japanese people are filled with unease due to the war in China, and it has now spread from the people to ordinary officials. In contrast, China is stable! Seeing the big picture from the small, China is victorious!

### French Prime Minister Firmly States Rejection of Hitler's Peace Proposal - No Armistice Without Solid Security Guarantees - The Goals of Britain and France Cannot Be Alienated by Germany

Paris - Prime Minister Daladier delivered a highly anticipated radio address tonight, explaining why German leader Hitler's proposed peace plan is difficult to accept. It is generally regarded as a response to Hitler's speech on the 6th of this month. The Prime Minister said that the sole purpose of Germany's proposal is to get other countries to acknowledge its conquest of Poland so that it can calmly prepare for new acts of conquest, which is unacceptable to us. "For a month, our soldiers have entered enemy territory and are advancing steadily. Our brave air force personnel have achieved glorious feats. Our navy has protected maritime traffic between our country and various locations and has proven to be effective. In addition to driving away enemy submarines, it has intercepted hundreds of thousands of tons of raw materials bound for Germany. In short, Britain and France have already controlled the ocean. According to past experience, those who control the ocean will invariably achieve final victory. This is a well-known fact." Communist leaders have been cursing Hitler and the German army day after day. However, since Bolshevism and National Socialism joined hands, this army has changed its attitude and expressed support for those who "abandon peace." This is truly intolerable. "We are not only fighting to defend our homeland and our fields, but also to protect the entire civilization. The entry of Britain and France into the war is neither participating in an ideological crusade nor based on the spirit of conquest. Britain and France are forced to fight because Germany intends to dominate Europe, which has led to this situation. Hitler's speech on the 6th of this month can be summarized in a few words: 'I have eliminated Poland, which is gratifying. Now is the time to stop the war and convene a conference to confirm my achievements.' We have heard this kind of tone more than once. Previously, after Germany annexed Austria and seized the Sudetenland, Hitler declared that he would not make any more demands. However, a few months later, Germany occupied the entire Czech Republic. Then Hitler said again that he would not make any more demands. After forcibly seizing Poland this time, he once again offered the same guarantees. Who will believe it? We hope that there will be sincere understanding and cooperation between all nations, as in the past and in the future. However, we will never submit to the 'orders' of violence. We have gone to war to resist aggression, and we will not lay down our arms until we have solid guarantees and are sure that our security will not be challenged every six months. Just think, if a country disappears from the map of Europe under armed aggression, what security can we or the entire world have? If every six months we witness others annexing or dividing a nation regardless of their promises, then no matter how big the world is, what nation will still have the guarantee of not being invaded by other countries? At this point, "if people truly care about achieving lasting peace, they should know that whether the security of each country can be ensured depends on whether they can provide guarantees to each other, eliminate all shocking actions, and build barriers to resist all attempts to dominate. I now reiterate in the name of the French nation that we are determined to continue fighting until we have the ultimate security guarantee." I know that the people of the whole country can fulfill their duties to the country, but we cannot rush into the army under enemy fire. We cannot start organizing under enemy bombing. If we demobilize by believing in empty promises, we will inevitably encounter new acts of aggression in a few months. The crisis is known to all, from national leaders to ordinary soldiers. As for Britain, it not only went to war with its fleet, but also sent army units and a large number of air force personnel to fight together. The sophistication of its equipment and the superbness of its tactics are truly admirable. German radio stations have repeatedly broadcast messages, claiming that Britain wants to use French blood to fight, intending to alienate Britain and France. However, this rumor has been dispelled by the successive arrivals of British soldiers and British artillery on the front lines. It can be seen that the propaganda of facts is better than the propaganda of rumors. In short, Britain and France are fighting for justice and civilization. The German soldiers are saying to themselves in the trenches, "Our government (referring to Germany) opposes the Treaty of Versailles based on the right of national self-determination. To this day, our government has successively conquered Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The result of implementing this policy of violence has put me in a war that is about killing. However, the right of these nations to survive is the same as that of the German nation. Therefore, my war aim is not justified." As for the French soldiers, they say, "Our government has done everything possible to preserve peace. We have not oppressed any nation, nor do we want to oppress any nation. I am here to defend my country and prevent Europe from encountering disasters, as millions of men, women, old, and young have encountered in the past two years. What I am doing is to eliminate the current situation. Therefore, my war aim is very justified and I believe I will be victorious." Such are the aspirations of our soldiers, and such are the aspirations of the people of the whole country. The French government, in its daily actions, is also showing unwavering determination to live up to the trust of the people of the whole country. This can be asserted. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

### London's Sympathy

London - Prime Minister Daladier's radio address has been praised unanimously by political figures. They say that the position of Britain and France is to curb the threat of German aggression and prevent countries from being enslaved by force. This position has been clearly explained by Prime Minister Daladier, which is the most clear and resolute answer of Britain and France to Hitler's speech. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

Paris - Prime Minister Daladier's radio address has been commented on by diplomatic circles here. They say that the content is consistent with the statements made by the French government. It firmly declares France's determination to continue fighting and denounces Hitler's past betrayals. No one can trust the rumors he offers anymore, and there is no reason to trust them. In short, Prime Minister Daladier did not express support or criticism for Hitler's speech, but simply ignored it. In addition, the Prime Minister emphasized that Britain and France are working together to fight without reservation, which is witnessed by the French people. This is to refute Germany's claim that France is fighting for Britain. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

### Berlin's Reaction

Berlin - The first impression of Berlin political figures after listening to Daladier's speech last night is that Daladier has not destroyed all attempts at peace. This morning, German newspapers quoted many paragraphs of Daladier's speech at great length, but without comment. The official side did not say a word last night. It is said that officials are still waiting for the full text of Daladier's speech to arrive and will not express their attitude until after reviewing the full text. Political figures believe that the main point of Daladier's speech is to demand security guarantees for France. This kind of demand is not contradictory to the statements mentioned by Hitler in his speech to the parliament. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

### American Impression

Washington - The first impression of people here on French Prime Minister Daladier is that France will continue fighting until Hitler can put forward a guarantee system that can make Britain and France absolutely understand when Germany is ready to abandon aggression. (Reuters, 11th)

New York - Today's New York Times said that we must recognize that Prime Minister Daladier's speech last night is a joint response from Britain and France to Hitler's peace conditions. This speech not only rejected Hitler's conditions, but also clearly announced that any conditions put forward by the current German government cannot be accepted. Hitler may no longer issue warnings, but will implement his threat to use secret weapons in the West. However, before implementing it, he may try to use diplomatic means to alienate Britain and France, or cause the intervention of a neutral country, which is quite possible. (Reuters, 11th)

### Chamberlain to Deliver a Speech Today - Labor Leader Talks About Peace - Says It Cannot Be Achieved With Empty Words

London - Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced yesterday that Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on the current situation, originally scheduled for the 11th of this month, has been postponed to the 12th of this month to allow ample time for consultation with the governments of the various autonomous territories. (Havas News Agency, 11th)

London - British Labour Party leader Attlee broadcast today, saying that if Hitler wants peace, he must show it by his actions. If he only restores the situation of the past eight years, it is not to seek peace, but only an armed truce. We are now fighting for the security of the people of all countries, including Germany. Illegal aggression must end. What the Labour Party considers important is this. What the Labour Party is fighting for is not hegemony or imperialism, but a world of peace in which all countries can live in peace and develop. Abandoning the method of aggression is the first condition for peace. If the people of Europe do not have closer unity, economic cooperation, disarmament, and collective security, then lasting peace will not be possible. Our strength lies in freedom. We must maintain freedom at home. When peace comes in the future, we must ensure that it is a peace based on justice. (Reuters, 10th)

### Britain Seeks to Promote Relations with the Soviet Union - Adjusting Trade Between the Two Countries

London - Undersecretary of State Butler declared in the Lower House today that the issue of making Anglo-Soviet trade relations suitable for the current state of war is now under consideration. The British side has discussed with the Soviet government to solve the preliminary number of difficulties. Undersecretary of State Butler said this in response to Liberal Party MP Mander, who wanted to know what action the government would take on the Soviet Union's proposal to reopen trade talks with Britain. Labour MP Smith asked whether Prime Minister Chamberlain had considered publishing a blue book detailing the needs of Anglo-Soviet relations during the period from August 1938 to October 1939. The Undersecretary of State, representing the government, replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax would carefully consider this question, but did not want to publish such an official document at this time. It should be known that the positions of other countries will be taken into account in the exchange of views between the British and Soviet governments. (Reuters, 11th)

### Soviet Union and Lithuania Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty Yesterday - Vilnius Province Returned to Lithuania - The Soviet Union Gains the Right to Station Troops in Lithuania

Moscow - Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys held negotiations on the return of the city and province of Vilnius to Lithuania and the issue of the Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty. From October 3 to October 10, the negotiations have been successfully completed. The two sides signed the Soviet Union's return of the city and province of Vilnius to Lithuania and the Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty on the 10th. Participants in the negotiations on the Soviet side included Stalin, Potemkin, and Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to Lithuania Pozdnyakov. The Lithuanian side included State Councilor Pivokas, Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis, and Lithuanian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Nakevičius. (TASS, 11th)

Lithuanian Capital - The Soviet government has decided to cede the northern part of Poland, the city of Vilnius, to Lithuania. However, it is said that troops will still be stationed there. The city of Vilnius originally belonged to Lithuania. In 1920, it was occupied by Polish troops. Until last month, it was occupied by the Soviet Union. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

Full Text of the Agreement

Moscow - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the President of the Republic of Lithuania, in order to develop the friendly relations established by the Treaty of Peace of July 12, 1920 between the two countries, based on the principles of recognizing each other's independence and non-interference in internal affairs, recognize the Treaty of Peace of July 12, 1920, and the Treaty of Non-Aggression and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes of September 28, 1926, and recognize that the practical provisions for guaranteeing mutual security conditions, and the return of the city and province of Vilnius, formerly illegally seized by Poland, to Lithuania, are in line with the interests of both parties, and have determined that it is necessary to conclude the following treaty on the return of the city and province of Vilnius to the Republic of Lithuania, and the treaty on mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and Lithuania.

### New Cabinet Formed in Estonia - 20,000 Soviet Troops Enter Estonia

Estonia - The capital's cabinet recently submitted its resignation to President Päts. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

Swedish Capital - Tonight's Swedish afternoon newspaper reported that a new cabinet was formed in Estonia today. The Prime Minister is Uluots and the Foreign Minister is Piip. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

Tallinn - Soviet troops will begin crossing the Estonian border on Friday to fulfill the terms of the new Soviet-Estonian agreement. (Reuters, 10th)

Swiss Capital - The Neue Zürcher Zeitung reported that 20,000 Soviet troops are scheduled to enter Estonia on the 12th of this month. Some will travel by train, while the rest will travel on foot. When the Soviet troops pass by, they will be guarded by Estonian soldiers lined up to avoid contact between the troops and the local people. (Havas News Agency, 9th)

### Finland on Military Alert - Determined to Maintain Neutrality - Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Begin Yesterday - Finland Unwilling to Make Major Concessions

Moscow - The Finnish delegation, led by the country's ambassador to Sweden, Paasikivi, arrived here this morning from Leningrad. They were received by Bakhlov, Director of the Protocol Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. However, the national flags of the two countries were not hung on the carriage, which was different from the situation when the foreign ministers of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia came to visit. In addition, staff from the Swedish embassy were also at the station to welcome them. Therefore, it is generally believed that when Paasikivi conducts negotiations with the Soviet authorities, the issue of fortifying the Åland Islands will also be raised for discussion, because this matter involves the interests of Finland and Sweden. (Havas News Agency, 11th)

Swedish Capital - When Finnish representative Paasikivi set off for Moscow today, there was a clear indication of national unity. The Finnish President, government officials, and representatives from all walks of life all went to the station to see him off. First, they shouted loudly, "Long live Finland!" Then they suddenly fell silent, and finally, the whole body sang the song of freedom. (Reuters, 10th)

Danish Capital - It is believed here that the Soviet Union is now putting pressure on Finland to fulfill its demands. Finland will definitely reject it. This can be evidenced by Finland's evacuation of residents from major cities. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union is now focusing on the port of Rovaniemi in Petsamo. The port is of great value to Finland and will not be abandoned without a major war. (Reuters, 11th)

Finnish Capital - While Finland is sending its representative Paasikivi to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet government, it is still calling up reservists to enlist. Many schools in the Vyborg region bordering the Soviet Union have been requisitioned by the military. Political figures have stated that this measure is purely a precautionary measure, hoping that the Moscow negotiations can eventually achieve a friendly settlement. It is said that the Finnish authorities are willing to accommodate the Soviet Union on the matter of concessions on some small islands, but are determined to resist all demands for the establishment of naval and air bases in Finland. According to foreign dispatches here, Paasikivi may not be as obedient to the Soviet Union during the negotiations in Moscow as the representatives sent by the Baltic countries recently. According to a dispatch from Svenska Dagbladet's Finnish capital, Finland cannot agree to any proposals that contradict the country's participation in the Nordic group. Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko told reporters, "Paasikivi is only going to inquire about the wishes of the Soviet Union. Whatever the wishes of the Soviet Union, Finland's position is very clear, namely to maintain northern neutrality, not to threaten other countries, not to seek special favors, and not to depend on any strong country or group." (Reuters, 10th)

Moscow - It is expected that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland, which are scheduled to begin tomorrow, will complete the expansion of Soviet interests related to the Baltic neighbors. The Soviet Union has negotiated treaties with Estonia and Latvia, and is now starting negotiations with Lithuania and Finland. In this way, the Soviet Union's great goal of making Leningrad a naval and air base, no longer controlled by the Gulf of Finland, can be achieved. Otherwise, it would not be difficult for any enemy to use the Gulf of Finland as a tool to block the Soviet Baltic Fleet's exit. In order to complete this procedure, the Soviet Union will try to invalidate any threats to the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland. Based on reason, the Soviet Union will also control the Åland Islands, using them as a base to control Sweden's exports to Germany in the future. (Reuters, 10th)

### Finland's Capital Evacuates Population

Helsinki - The Finnish government, worried about the seriousness of the situation, decided to implement the voluntary evacuation of residents from the cities and towns of Helsinki, Vyborg, Tampere, and Åbo starting today. A quarter of Helsinki residents voluntarily evacuated today, and another quarter will be evacuated on Thursday. Informed sources here say that there is no cause for alarm at the border at present. There is no concentration of Soviet troops there. However, the number of Soviet permanent troops may increase today. (Reuters, 11th)

### Strange Ships Found in the Gulf of Finland

Helsinki - Tonight there was a trial of lighting control here, and the whole city was in darkness. It is reported that a strange ship was found near the Åland Islands in the Gulf of Finland, and all cargo ships heading to the coast were inspected. According to a certain ship that arrived in Mariehamn today, the ship did not block German merchant ships, but inspected merchant ships of other countries very strictly. (Reuters, 10th)

### India Agrees to Send Representatives to Attend the Imperial Conference

London - The Ministry of Information announced that the Indian government has agreed to send representatives to London to attend the Imperial Conference. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

### Germany Begins Winter Relief Campaign - Hitler Delivers a Speech

Berlin - This year's winter relief fundraising campaign began at 3:50 pm today. Propaganda Minister Goebbels immediately delivered a speech, saying, "The German nation is prepared to make all kinds of sacrifices. It is deeply aware of the serious nature of this year's winter relief campaign, which is being held in wartime. We originally chose one day each week to have only one dish per meal in order to save money. In the future, we will use the saved money as winter relief donations." (Having only one dish per meal has been practiced for several years, which is actually a measure taken by the National Socialist Party to limit food consumption. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

After Goebbels finished speaking, Hitler continued to speak, saying that he was sure that no country in the world could defeat Germany militarily or spiritually. No matter what happens later, they will never see Germany surrender. The world will get what it chooses. He has come a long way and finally rescued Germany from being destroyed by the Treaty of Versailles. But the road ahead cannot be more difficult than the one that has already been traveled. Hitler said of the winter relief that domestic sacrifices cannot be compared with the sacrifices of the soldiers at the front. The enemy wants to destroy our people, but we will establish a new and stronger country to answer the enemy's delusion. We have developed its ideals in war and will prove them in war. The German people must be able to adjust their own lives according to their own wishes and demand a part of the world's wealth that they deserve. We have adopted various plans to eliminate class differences. The firmer our determination to accept sacrifices, the more we can achieve the peace we need. If others choose war, then they will have a life-and-death war. Nothing can prevent the realization of our eternal destiny. (Reuters, 10th)

### Soviet Troops Concentrated on the Caucasus Border - Their Intention is Unknown

Paris - It is reported that Soviet troops are now concentrated in Baku on the Caspian Sea and other points near the Caucasus border. The reason for this is still unknown. (Reuters, 10th)

### In Baltic States, German Nationals Begin Evacuation; Minority Exchange Plan Realized; Germany Seeks Soviet Aid, Enduring Painful Sacrifices

Amsterdam – According to a Berlin dispatch from this city’s news wires, the Soviet Union agreed to provide assistance to Germany in exchange for substantial compensation. Now, this compensation has been secured. The gains include not only the eastern part of Poland but also the liberation of the Baltic states. This constitutes a painful sacrifice for Germany, made only after repeated hesitations and lengthy consideration. The Soviet westward advance not only restricts the expansion of Germany’s sphere of influence but also compels Germany to abandon “historically important locations of Germanic order and valuable cultural frontiers.” The dissatisfaction and criticism from many Germans regarding the Baltic sacrifice are self-evident. (Reuters, 10th)

Zurich, Switzerland – Following German Führer Hitler’s speech on the 6th of this month, declaring an exchange of minorities with Eastern and Southeastern European countries, German nationals within the Baltic coastal states began preparing to evacuate. German ships are expected to arrive at the Latvian capital to transport them back to Germany. The majority of these are large landowners who have made significant contributions to promoting Germanic civilization among the Slavic peoples. It is reported that there are 62,000 Germans in Lithuania, 23,000 in Estonia, and another 23,000 in Latvia. Upon hearing this news, they were all extremely indignant. Firstly, they were unwilling to leave their birthplace, and secondly, they believed that Germany had a historical mission in Eastern Europe, which Hitler had now abandoned. Moreover, after their departure, their “vital living space” would be taken over by Bolsheviks, a prospect that filled them with outrage. To appease the anger of these large landowners, the German authorities have promised them lands owned by Polish nobles. However, 90,000 Germans from the Soviet-occupied eastern part of Poland are currently being relocated to the German-controlled western part of Poland. It is doubtful whether the aforementioned lands will be sufficient for distribution. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, Hitler has fully adopted the views of Nazi Party theorist Josef Hohner and is preparing to relocate Germans from the Danube River region on a large scale. According to this plan, Czechs would be moved to the Soviet Union, while German minorities from the Banat region of Yugoslavia and Romania would be moved to the Czech-inhabited areas. Hungarians in Sibiu, Romania, would be evacuated to Hungary, while Germans within Hungary would be moved to Sibiu, after which Romania would be asked to place the city under German sovereignty, making it German territory. It seems that Hitler’s proposed minority exchange plan will be fully realized. (Havas, 9th)

Berlin – Official circles confirm that Germany has indeed begun discussions with Estonia and Latvia regarding the repatriation of German nationals. Official circles also stated that German nationals' property will be adequately protected. Official diplomatic sources explained the reason for transferring German nationals from the Baltic states, stating that Hitler, in order to adjust European life, has formulated a program for transferring Eastern Germans. This program is being implemented step by step. Currently, efforts have been made to transport 10,000 German nationals back. They can perform useful work in the reclaimed German provinces and restore German order there. This movement proves that Germany has no imperialist ambitions and does not want to use Germans who have long resided in Eastern Europe to interfere and seize European power. (Reuters, 10th)

### Berlin Announces Details of German-Polish Negotiations

Berlin – The German official news agency today issued a statement refuting British arguments regarding the causes of the Polish war. The British statement asserted that Britain offered guarantees to Poland only on March 31, 1939, while Germany’s proposals were presented on March 21. Therefore, Britain believes that the Polish issue should be blamed on Germany. In fact, Germany's proposals to Poland date back to October 24, 1938, followed by four rounds of negotiations. The first round took place on October 24 of last year in Berchtesgaden, where German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop proposed a peaceful solution to the German-Polish problem to Polish Ambassador Lipski, with four points: (1) Allow Danzig to return to Germany, but with special consideration for Poland's economic interests. (2) Allow Germany to build railways and highways in the corridor, providing Germany with extraterritorial traffic routes to East Prussia. (3) Germany and Poland mutually recognize and guarantee each other's borders. (4) Germany expresses its willingness to extend the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact for ten to fifteen years.

The second round of talks took place on January 15 of this year in Berchtesgaden between German Führer Hitler and Polish Foreign Minister Beck. Hitler proposed a "contractual guarantee" solution, which was not adopted.

The third round was German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Warsaw from January 25 to 27, where he again proposed adjustments to German-Polish relations to Polish Foreign Minister Beck.

The fourth round was on March 21 of this year, proposing a complete solution to bilateral issues to Polish Ambassador Lipski.

Until the fourth round of talks, all peaceful solutions were rejected. After Britain offered guarantees on March 31, the German Führer announced the abolition of the German-Polish Pact on April 28. It is evident that Poland was fully aware of the nature, content, and scope of Germany's proposals but deliberately withheld the truth from Britain and France, so that they would believe Poland was facing a sudden threat and would offer assistance. Based on all the facts, it is clear that the entire responsibility lies with Poland's "abuse of British and French guarantees." (Haitong, 11th)

### The Question of War or Peace: Two Paths to Follow

Either Bomb Berlin, or Negotiate Peace Directly

—George Bernard Shaw's Quick Words—

Manchester – British author and satirist George Bernard Shaw wrote a letter to the Manchester Guardian today, stating that Chamberlain currently has only two paths to follow: (1) Bomb Berlin, or (2) Negotiate peace directly. According to Shaw, Britain’s promise to Poland implies bombing Berlin. Apart from bombing Berlin, Britain can hardly help Poland. But Chamberlain is deeply afraid that Germany will take retaliatory action, so he wants to act but hesitates. Shaw also said that when the British and French forces attack the Western Front, Hitler could have launched a large-scale bombing of London, but Hitler also dared not act rashly for the same concerns. However, Chamberlain should now clearly state whether he intends to bomb Berlin or not. If Chamberlain has this intention, the results will far exceed what we expect. If there is no such intention, it is better to end the situation as soon as possible." (Associated Press, 11th)

### Western Ukraine Convenes National Assembly to Discuss Nation-Building; Elections Under Preparation

Moscow – The provisional government of Lviv recently published a notice to the people of Western Ukraine, suggesting that a Western Ukrainian National Assembly be convened based on the principles of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage to determine the national existence of Western Ukraine. This suggestion has been approved by the provisional governments of Stanislavov, Tarnopol, and Luck. They suggest organizing a committee to prepare for the National Assembly elections. The main tasks of the National Assembly should be the following:

Establishing a Soviet regime in Western Ukraine, merging Western Ukraine with the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, confiscating landlords' lands and distributing them to peasants, and nationalizing banks and large industrial factories. (TASS, 11th)

### German Forces on the Western Front Appear to Be Taking the Offensive; Intense Artillery Battles Along the Entire Line Between the Moselle and Rhine Rivers

Rumor that Hitler Will Go to the Western Front to Command

Paris – The actions of German forces on the Western Front seem to be gradually taking on an offensive posture. The German army is heavily concentrated in the area between the Moselle and Saarbrücken, as the commander-in-chief is quite uneasy about the continuing pressure from the French forces there. The Germans have repeatedly launched attacks in this area, attempting to capture French soldiers for intelligence, but no French soldiers have been captured, as all German advances have been stopped by French machine guns. It is believed that Hitler's goal is to drive the French forces out of German territory. Intense artillery battles are taking place along the entire line between the Moselle and Rhine rivers, indicating that the German army will soon make a major effort to retake the Saarbrücken. However, the French forces are in a good defensive position, and the obstacles faced by the German army are extremely formidable. Therefore, any attempt by the German army to retake Saarbrücken will meet with serious resistance. To maintain its offensive, the German army will inevitably have to use 500,000 to 1,000,000 troops, and the extent of its losses will be astonishing. If the Germans choose a more accessible route, invading Verdun via Luxembourg, the French commander has already made preparations. It is believed that the Germans have another option, which is to launch an attack parallel to the Luxembourg border, flanking the Maginot Line on the Swiss side. The current concentration of German forces in the northern and southern parts of Germany suggests the possibility of adopting this strategy. (Reuters, 10th)

Paris – According to neutral sources, Hitler may arrive at the Western Front this week to assume the position of supreme commander of the German army. After that, Aviation Minister Göring will replace Hitler in taking actual command. His rank will be above the commander-in-chief of the German army, von Brauchitsch. At that time, Hitler's own lightning war plan will be adopted, replacing the strategy prepared by the General Staff over the years, which has progressed simultaneously with the Franco-German defense system. According to French war reports, enemy reconnaissance patrols were very active yesterday between the Moselle and Saar rivers on the Western Front. The enemy launched several attacks in this area, some of which were quite effective, but all were repelled by French forces. (Reuters, 11th)

Brussels – A Havas correspondent recently inspected the Belgian border and is deeply aware that the Belgian General Staff has taken effective military measures on the northern and eastern borders. King Leopold III has ordered that the details of border defenses not be disclosed, but it is generally believed that the border troops are well-trained, have high morale, are well-equipped, and have many flat-trajectory guns. Although Germany has stated that "if French forces invade Belgium, Germany is prepared to defend it," the people on the Belgian border generally believe that Germany has no intention of attacking the country, and they do not believe that French forces will invade the country. They also believe that if Germany launches a brazen attack on Belgium, they will do their best to resist. Furthermore, according to observers on the Belgian border, Germany has not concentrated heavy troops in the area near the Belgian border. However, from the city of Gemmenich to the border of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there is an average of one soldier stationed every ten meters. In some places, artillery units and anti-aircraft units are also deployed. In addition, there are many trucks loaded with soldiers and military supplies heading to the Luxembourg border and the Siegfried Line in the German city of Malmedy. (Havas, 10th)

Paris – The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 74, stating, "A large number of enemy patrols probed our military positions south of the cities of Saarlouis and Pirmasens last night and were repelled." Semi-official sources went on to explain that the goal of German activities in recent days has been to test the strength of our forward positions and the operational plans formulated by our General Staff, repeatedly attempting to capture our soldiers in order to obtain the truth, but without success. Yesterday, enemy patrols were present along the entire line (a total of 160 kilometers). These units, with ten men each, were tasked with reconnaissance of our positions. Some of them even approached our barbed wire defenses or crossed the barbed wire. At that time, both sides threw hand grenades at each other, and our army finally repelled them and inflicted heavy damage. (Havas, 11th)

Paris – The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 71, stating, "Enemy patrol units were very active today between the Saar and Moselle rivers. There was an artillery battle between enemy and our forces between the Rhine and Moselle rivers. In addition, one of our warships attacked a German submarine, with considerable success." (Havas, 9th)

Paris – The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 72, stating, "Enemy patrol units were active southeast of the Saar River yesterday. Artillery units on both sides also shelled each other in that area." (Havas, 10th)

Paris – The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 73, stating, "Enemy troops were engaged in reconnaissance between the Saar and Moselle rivers today and launched repeated attacks, sometimes with considerable strength, but all were repelled by our side." (Havas, 10th)

### Four British Planes Fly Reconnaissance Over Germany, Obtaining Important Photos

London – British journalist Clifford, who accompanied the British Air Force to France to observe the war, recently stated that four British planes conducted their first daytime reconnaissance flight over German territory along the German border from France to the North Sea. The headquarters received important information about (1) the evacuation of residents from several important German cities, (2) the concentration of German troops in Aachen, (3) the construction of fortresses on the Luxembourg border, and (4) the concentration of the German Air Force. Therefore, it sent planes directly into German territory to verify that this information was accurate. The results of the British reconnaissance are now being studied by experts. It is reported that the photos taken by two of the planes are extremely valuable. The four British planes were divided into two pairs and took off from a secret British airfield behind the Maginot Line. The first pair encountered bad weather, their altitude was often 6,000 feet, and they flew past the southernmost tip of Luxembourg, that is, the factory behind the French artillery shelling of the outer edge of the Siegfried Line, and continued to appear and disappear in the clouds to conduct reconnaissance of everything. When they reached Koblenz in German territory, German anti-aircraft gunners used the sound of the planes to determine the distance and direction of the British planes and fired. Shells passed through the clouds and exploded around the British planes, but the British planes were not hit and continued to advance. German gunners urgently notified other locations by telephone, so when the British planes flew to Siegburg, they were again subjected to heavy anti-aircraft fire, but they still passed safely and reached Aachen along the Belgian border. When they saw the Rhine River flowing west into the Netherlands, the weather became extremely bad, and they could not see anything looking down. Then they headed towards the German North Sea coast, carefully avoiding Dutch territory, and finally safely arrived at the designated British airfield. The first pair flew out before dawn, and when the sun rose on the mountains east of the Rhine River, they had been in German territory for a long time, and the weather was also suitable, so they were able to take the photos they obtained. (Reuters, 10th)

London – A Reuters war correspondent recently stated that the British Air Force on the Western Front is now preparing for its first real air battle with the enemy. All bombers and fighters have been distributed to secret airfields behind the battle line, waiting for orders to move out. British bombers have not yet shown their power on the Western Front, but they are gradually learning the skills of the German Air Force and anti-aircraft guns. (Reuters, 11th)

Amsterdam – According to travelers arriving here from Germany, a large number of anti-aircraft guns have now been stationed in the German territory along the German-Dutch border, fearing that the British Air Force will attack the Ruhr and other western industrial areas. (Reuters, 11th)

### German Air Force Attacks British Fleet in the North Sea; Most of Five German Planes Land in Denmark

London – The Admiralty has just issued a bulletin, stating briefly, "One of our patrol ships discovered a German fleet in the sea southwest of Norway, and our fleet sailed to meet it, but because of the darkness, the enemy ships were able to escape. In addition, a team of German bombers attacked several of our cruisers and destroyers in the northeastern North Sea today. Our side immediately opened anti-aircraft guns to resist. As a result, our side suffered no damage, and the extent of the enemy's losses is also unclear." (Havas, 9th)

Danzig – News of the battle between several British cruisers and a team of German bombers in the North Sea last night has now been confirmed. It is estimated that there were two German planes which were forced to land in Danish territory. The third plane had heard it was landing in Norway territory, and the crew are being detained by the Norwegian government. There were also two German aircrafts in which one had fallen on the beach. The remaining plane flew above Jutland at very low altitudes. The Danish anti-aircraft fire was shooting it down. (Reuters, 10th)

London – Five German bombers engaged in combat with several British cruisers and destroyers in the North Sea yesterday. One of them crashed into the sea in Danish waters, another crashed into Sweden, and another flew low over Danish airspace while fleeing, and was fired on by the country's anti-aircraft guns. The other two, due to lack of gasoline, landed in Denmark. One was on Fanø Island, west of Esbjerg, and one pilot was injured and has been sent to the hospital. The others have been detained. The other was at Nymindegab harbor, north of Esbjerg, all four pilots are unharmed. They burned the plane themselves, claiming to Danish authorities that it was caused by a bomb explosion. They claimed they departed from south of Hamburg and flew for eight hours, dropping bombs on British warships and engaging in combat with British planes. Among these pilots, one was older and had participated in the Spanish Civil War and was wearing a medal presented by Spanish head of state General Franco. (Havas, 10th)

Copenhagen – A German military plane flew into Danish airspace near the port of Aabenraa in the southern German peninsula at 3:00 PM this afternoon. It was fired upon by anti-aircraft guns. The plane was reportedly forced to land near Nymindegab harbor in western Jutland at around 5:00 PM. The four pilots then burned the plane themselves and told the police that they were flying to the North Sea for reconnaissance and were forced to land in Denmark due to lack of gasoline. (Havas, 9th)

Berlin – An official statement this afternoon said that several German bombers flew to the vicinity of the west coast of Norway on the 9th of this month and attacked several British warships. Six of the bombs hit the vital points of the British cruisers, and the sound of the explosion was heard several miles away. Two German planes were forced to land in Danish waters. (Haitong, 10th)

Berlin – The official news agency announced today that German warships and planes had fought with British ships in the North Sea in the past few days. Some British ships were damaged, and the fighting is still ongoing. (Reuters, 11th)

### British Warships Intercept Japanese Ships

Tokyo – Local newspapers are fiercely criticizing the British warships intercepting Japanese merchant ships, regarding it as a threat to Japanese interests. The Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that British ships have recently intercepted Japanese ships near Taiwan and Nagasaki. A British cruiser appeared near the Japanese coast at the end of September, a British warship was found between Japan and Taiwan in early October, and a British warship was found near the southern coast of Japan on October 7. These reports were all submitted by Japanese merchant ships. The newspapers said that the appearance of British ships near the Japanese coast has angered people in the Japanese shipping industry. The Japanese people find it difficult to understand the actions of these British ships. (Haitong, 11th)

Tokyo – British naval attaché Colonel Duffinell gave a statement today regarding the Japanese media reports that Japanese merchant ships had recently been intercepted by British ships near Japanese territorial waters. "Such actions may be surprising to the Japanese people, but they do not contain any meaning to deal with Japan. The British ships near Japanese territorial waters are only carrying out their routine patrol duties, as they do all over the world. This kind of action by British ships is normal in wartime. As for the interception of a few Japanese ships, it is only to determine whether they are indeed Japanese ships or German ships pretending to be. Therefore, the interception of Japanese ships by British ships should not be considered impolite to Japan and should not be viewed in that way. The British ships in the vicinity of Japanese territorial waters are entirely performing patrol duties in order to intercept German ships heading to or leaving Japan in the waters there." The Nichinichi Shimbun published a criticism of the Japanese reports that two Japanese ships had recently been intercepted by British ships near Wakayama and Nagasaki, saying that the Japanese side found the actions of the British authorities incomprehensible.

### Guangdong Province Chinese Army Intensifies Mobilization for General Offensive on Guangzhou; Simultaneous Actions on Both Banks of the East River; Ammunition Depot of Japanese Army Attached to Shatin Explodes

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Chinese army is actively implementing a counter-offensive against Guangzhou. Zhang Fakui, acting commander of the ×th War Zone, has ordered the three armies of the east, west, and north, as well as the guerrillas, to intensify mobilization and cooperate with the central mechanized units to pressure Guangzhou. This decision for a counter-offensive has been prepared for a long time, and the training of guerrillas and the replenishment of regular army personnel have been satisfactorily resolved. It is said that the conscription is proceeding excellently. On the East River front, the overall offensive is being launched simultaneously from the Zengcong line on the north bank and the Dongbao line on the south bank. At the same time, efforts are being intensified to suppress bandits and traitors bought by ××× operating in Guishan and Elephant Head Mountain. The Liang Zhu unit of the Mou Detachment of the Third Column entered Elephant Head Mountain on the first of this month and captured many puppet "Revival Army" soldiers. Provincial guerrilla command chief Xiang Hanping has established a reformatory for puppet soldiers. If it is found that the puppet soldiers were acting under duress, they will all be taken in. The reformatory has only been open for a month, and the defection of puppet soldiers in Guangzhou is like a rising storm. Many puppet soldiers in the reformatory repent of being used by the Japanese. Therefore, when they hear that our army is counter-attacking Guangzhou, they are all willing to serve the country and act as guides. As a result, various traitors in Elephant Head Mountain flee at the first sign of trouble, and the bandits in Guishan have also ceased their activities. The military movements in Zengcong and Dongbao are recorded below.

Japanese Army Movements

The Guangzhou Japanese Army Headquarters is aware that the Chinese army is gradually launching a general counter-offensive. The Japanese army held a secret meeting to respond to the Chinese army. According to intelligence, the Japanese army authorities have ordered the Japanese army in Foshan and Sanshui to construct defensive works along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road, adopting a defensive posture on the western front. The Japanese army is currently deploying troops in Central and Northwest China and cannot reinforce South China. However, they are extremely afraid that the Chinese army on the southern section of the Guangdong Road and the Zengcong line will attack Guangzhou directly. Therefore, there have been changes in the Japanese army's organization recently. A regiment is composed of a mixture of regular Japanese army, Taiwanese, Korean army, Northeast puppet army, and Guangdong puppet Revival Army. Japanese army tanks, armored vehicles, donkeys, and horses stationed in Guangzhou are being moved out one after another, and citizens are being forced to manufacture a large number of "Japanese flags" to create a deception and confuse the Chinese army. The ammunition and weapons stored in the Henan warehouse are being busily transported out.

Puppet Army Rebellion

The Guangzhou Japanese army has built many military depots in the Yantang and Shatin areas to store weapons and explosives. On the evening of the first of this month, the Shatin military depot suddenly exploded and caught fire. The commander of the Southern China Expeditionary Army, Ando Rikichi, suspected that it was caused by anti-war elements in the army. On the morning of the second, he sent a large force of military police to the eastern suburbs and arrested a total of 150 Korean soldiers, who were taken back to headquarters. The arrested Korean soldiers, because the war has been indefinite and they have been repeatedly attacked by our army and civilians, cannot sleep peacefully. The anti-war sentiment is growing stronger. It is said that this group of Korean soldiers will be sent back to Taiwan.

Fierce Battle in Zengcheng

On September 29th, the Japanese army sent twenty-two anti-tank guns and field guns from the Guangzhou-Huizhou Highway to Zengcheng. Japanese aircraft also scouted day and night in the areas around Zengcheng: Boluo, Zhengguo, Paitan, Luofu Mountain, Conghua, and Aotou. Traitors were sent to the villages near the war zone to threaten the public and attempt to seize food. A senior commander of the Mou Army Group of the Chinese army in Zengcheng recently inspected the positions on the front line and instructed Tan Sui, the commander of the Mou Army in charge of the Zengcong line, that the Chinese side's conscription and supply could be continuous. The elite new army of the Chinese side in Luofu Mountain has advanced towards Zengcheng. On September 30th, they arrived at the outer line of Zengcheng. They launched three attacks in the evening, and the new artillery remotely bombarded Zengcheng to cover the Chinese army's advance. The outposts exchanged fire for six hours that day. The Japanese army responded with mortars. The Japanese army in Zengcheng is now under pressure and looks as if they will retreat to the periphery of Zengcheng. The Chinese army in Zhengguo and Luofu Mountain is very excited. All units are advancing according to the original route to strengthen the front line. A major battle is about to begin.

Eastern Front Guerrillas: The Chinese army on the eastern front adopted a mobile warfare strategy, using the towering mountains of the East River as a base for annihilating the Japanese army. The puppet army of the Luofu Mountain Range has been completely suppressed by our Tan Sui's active suppression in September. This vast mountain range is specially used as a large base for deploying, training regular new troops and guerrillas. Recently, Guangdong Province received instructions from the Military Training Department and the Ministry of Military Affairs, unifying guerrilla education in Guangdong Province. The new guidelines have been issued to Guangdong, with Luofu Mountain and a certain two places as the guerrilla education zone. The Chen Shenrong unit of the Fourth Column was transferred for training. Because the Guangdong Provincial Guerrilla Team operates extensively, the method of mine collection and cycle training, the guerrilla warfare between Dongbao, is replaced by the security group of Chi Zhongkuan's unit and the guerrilla teams of Yuan Huazhao and Liu Fayu to engage in guerrilla warfare in the two counties in the east. Furthermore, the southern section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has been controlled by the Chinese army, and guerrilla positions have been established to inflict significant blows on the Japanese army at any time. Currently, the Guangzhou-Kowloon line is stationed from Buji and Pinghu to Shigutou, Lilang, Tiantangwei, Tangtouxia, and Zhangmutou, in large forces to deal with Japanese mechanized units. In order to cope with the Japanese mechanized unit operations, people everywhere were mobilized to participate enthusiastically in destroying the railway, dismantling the rails, and moving the sleepers elsewhere. The Japanese army in Shenzhen is also afraid of the Chinese army attacking along the railway, and after destroying the railway, they have added obstacles such as bamboo fences and barbed wire. Even if the Japanese army makes every effort to clear the Guangzhou-Kowloon Road after this contest, it will not be able to repair and open the road in a short period of time.

Japanese Army Captured

Recently, the Panyu militia has been attacking the Japanese army and carrying out sabotage in the Ping Mountain, Pingzhou, Weiyong, Lezhu, and Bijiang areas bordering Shunde, Nanhai, and Panyu. Although the Japanese army has repeatedly coordinated with the puppet pacification army to carry out so-called sweeps, they have gained nothing. The Chinese militia avoids the strong and attacks the weak. When the Japanese army arrives, it disintegrates into smaller units and disperses into the suburbs, making it impossible for the Japanese army to grasp. At 7:00 AM on the morning of the 28th of last month, Second Lieutenant Kawamoto Kunio (from Tokushima, Shikoku, Japan), a platoon leader of the 43rd Regiment of the 11th Division of the Japanese Army, drove a motorboat from Pingzhou to Guangzhou. The boat carried five Japanese soldiers and more than ten puppet soldiers. It arrived in Guangzhou at about 9:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, it returned from Guangzhou to Pingzhou. The boat was fully loaded with grain. When the boat sailed to the Ping Mountain waters on the border of Panyu and Nanhai, it was discovered by the He Wencan unit of the Chinese militia, who opened fire with machine guns and densely swept at it. First, the helmsman was killed. Because the boat had no one to drive it and the machinery was damaged, it ran aground on the sand and could not move. The Japanese and puppet armies exchanged fire with the militia for half an hour. Ammunition was exhausted and no reinforcements arrived. More than ten people were killed or injured. The rest jumped into the water and escaped. Kawamoto Kunio was captured alive by the militia because he was injured in the head and hands. Several Japanese rifles and a large quantity of grain were seized. On the 30th, he was escorted back to the Panyu County government and interrogated by Li Shuzong, the deputy commander of the Mou Guerrilla Zone and concurrently the magistrate of Panyu County. According to Kawamoto, he had recently been incorporated into the Fujita Transport Team and was transporting grain to Pingzhou that day.

### Double Tenth Festival Football Match: Donghua Defeats St. Francis 2-1; Poor Ball Luck in First Half, Saving a Penalty Kick Reverses the Situation

On the Double Tenth Festival, Donghua played a friendly match against St. Francis at Yiyuan. As a result of Donghua's fierce attack, they only won by two to one. They were actually behind by zero to one in the first half. St. Francis' ball luck was particularly good, and Donghua's attacks repeatedly failed to score. Cabotto's goalkeeping was exceptional. In the middle of the second half, Donghua was penalized with another penalty kick. The misfortune in ball luck was consistent. However, Gu Biao blocked it successfully in a tense atmosphere. From then on, Donghua turned from bad luck to good, entering a smooth path, scoring two goals in a row and reversing the defeat into victory. Three thousand spectators cheered and shouted in a tense atmosphere. Donghua finally announced victory. Donghua attacked first,

Frequent Loss of Opportunities

Donghua attacked first for a long time but did not make any progress. Therefore, the second team rose up and made every effort to launch an attack. Unfortunately, fate was unkind, and all their efforts were in vain. A Dai's low shot hit the goal post and bounced out without any response, which was a pity. Jia Youliang repeatedly attacked the goal, but all were bounced out by the crossbar. After that, Donghua had an excellent opportunity to attack the goal, but none of the results were fruitful. Looking back at the St. Francis team, they were closely monitored by Donghua players. However, when it was 31 minutes into the game, Fuen raised the flag and launched a single-handed attack, passing to Kai Xu'erzi, who shot diagonally, taking the lead with one to zero. Donghua lost this city, and launched a major counterattack, still trapped in the unfortunate game of fate, and failed for a long time. The first half ended, Donghua was behind by zero to one,

Final Victory

After the lemon, Donghua's lineup was slightly changed. Chen Hongguang returned to the defense to protect the home. A Rong was transferred to the center back to adopt a three-inside-guard strategy. However, the momentum did not improve in the first ten minutes. Youliang's header did not go in, and A Dai's shot was caught again. At 15 minutes, Hongguang went deep into the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Fuen took the penalty, and Gu Biao jumped up and saved it. Therefore, the army counterattacked, and Cai Shengsen tied the score to one each in the crowd, winning a lot of applause. At 30 minutes, A Dai scored a low shot from 15 yards, establishing a 2-1 victory. Since then, Donghua's offensive has been strong. The overall result was 2-1. Donghua came from behind,

### Inter-Port Football: Another Problem; Difficult to Achieve at Christmas, Further Discussion Needed Next Spring

(Hong Kong News) The Hong Kong Football Association held a monthly meeting at 5:30 pm on the second day, in the conference room on the fifth floor of the Guangdong Bank. Attendees included Bi Lite (Hong Kong Club), Fen Dang (Kowloon Club), Chen Hanming (South China Club), Ju Bi (Police), Jian Jin (St. Joseph's), Li Huitang (Association), Wen Wu (Midushixi), Bin Wu (Army), and Gu Ba (Navy). The agenda started at 5:40 pm and lasted one hour. First, the routine cases of the previous month were passed and recognized. Then, the inter-port match between Hong Kong and Shanghai, the readmission of Midushixi, and three cases concerning the lease term of the venue were discussed. Finally, the Police Club Ju Bi proposed a temporary motion. All representatives present sincerely consulted and passed it satisfactorily. Chairman Yi read the Shanghai Western Union's letter of the 12th of last month, reiterating that they had no objection to extending the time by ten minutes for the inter-port match between Hong Kong and Shanghai to be held in Shanghai this year, requesting to send a team to meet during Christmas or the Lunar New Year. After the letter was read out, the opinions of the representatives were sought. Chen Hanming, the representative of the South China Club, said, "Given the current environment, it is still difficult for the South China Club to send personnel to participate." Ju Bi, the representative of the Police Club, said, "The inter-port match can wait until early spring next year." Chairman Bi, seeing that the committee members had a wait-and-see attitude, consulted the representatives of the Army and Navy, hoping that they could express their opinions, but both representatives said they had nothing to say. Chairman Bi, after learning that the proposal to send a team to Shanghai during the Christmas period was difficult to fulfill, then announced, "Within the possible scope, a team will be sent to fulfill the agreement during the Lunar New Year next year." The police representative first seconded the proposal, and the case was passed. The two matches, one to go and one to return, which had been arranged once before, were also implicitly cancelled.

### Finance Export Bills of Exchange are Being Cashed Out in a Steady Stream, There is a Disparity between Supply and Demand, and the British and American Exchange Markets are Relaxing Non-Stop

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The situation in the British and American exchange grey market was still loose, all because the "扒者" (market manipulators) were weak and the supply exceeded the demand. This is because people now generally believe that there is a major turning point in the situation, reversing the past style and tending to throw off/sell. This is due to the fact that the overseas British and American mutual exchange rate, the US to the UK rose by one and a half points from before the holiday, resulting in a divergence in the British and American situation. The UK was tight at 0.15625, while the US was strong at 0.3125. Subsequently, foreign telegrams from Hong Kong, etc., and exporters successively sold, and foreign banks such as Chase Bank and Chinese banks also sold positions, so the situation was uniformly loose and hard. However, although British banks were favorable and absorbed together with Japanese banks, it once returned to equilibrium, but it could not be maintained for long due to the disparity between the many and the few. As a result, the closing price was 4 and 625 and 7.8125, the loosest price of the day, 0.046875 looser than before the holiday and 0.15625 harder for the US. As for the future trend, there is no difference with the spot market. Trading in the morning was still strong, 0.0625, for 3 pence and 8125, for 1875 longer for US spot.

Chinese Merchants in Hong Kong are Still Selling

In the early morning, the London big bill, near term was long 375, far term rose 625, New York silver price rose 1.125, London gold was stable, exchange rates were even for UK to US, Shanghai, and France, and US was high for UK by 1.5, long for Shanghai by 5, and big 625 for France. The above were all settled according to the closure before the holiday. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates were the same as before. The bank opened the spot selling price in the morning, British gold was 4 and 5625, US exchange rate was 7.6875, which was slightly tighter for UK than the previous close by 0.015625, and slightly looser for US by 0.03125. This was due to the rise in the US and British exchange rates. After opening, the market trend became loose due to the successive sales by exporters and foreign telegrams from Hong Kong, etc., and foreign banks also had a strong willingness to sell. Exporters and Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British gold to foreign HSBC, etc. for 4 and 625, and then Hong Kong telegrams and certain banks such as Foreign Belgium-China and Chase Bank sold spot US exchange rates to money changers and foreign firms for 7.75 and 8.25. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be one and a half points higher. After this, the British Bank and Right came to absorb, and the Japanese bank (Zhengjin Bank) also followed up and settled. Therefore, the situation once became tight. The British Bank and Right and Zhengjin Bank settled the spot British gold of foreign banks for 4 and 5625, and the spot US exchange rate for 7.75. Then, Chinese banks came to sell, and Hong Kong came to sell again, so the situation became more difficult. Chinese banks and foreign telegrams sold spot British gold to foreign banks for 4 and 625, and spot US exchange rate for 7.8125. Later, speculators sold the US exchange rate for November to foreign banks for 7.6875. Extended to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price, British gold was 4 and 625, US exchange rate was 7.8125, the current month was the same as the spot market, and the November British gold was 4 and 5625, and the US exchange rate was 7.6875. As a result, compared to before the holiday (i.e. Monday this week), both the current and future British exchange rates were loose by 0.046875, and the US exchange rates were all hard by 0.15625. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong: Only US Exchange Rate is Slightly Loose

Hong Kong, 11th: The exchange market opened calmly this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate rose slightly by one yuan to 324 yuan. At 11:30 am, it was stable. The US exchange rate spot was loose by 0.0625, at 25.25 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell back by four yuan to 320 yuan. The afternoon close, the Shanghai exchange rate rose again by one yuan to 321 yuan. There was no market after 3 pm.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Continues to Increase

Tianjin, 11th: The exchange market opened hard this morning. The spot for UK was loose by 0.0625, at 3 pence and 8125, and the spot for US was long by 1875, at 6.5625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by two yuan to 115 yuan. The "United Notes" grey market was cheap by half a yuan, at 88 places.

### People's Hearts are Changing, The Legal Tender is Expensive and Foreign Currencies are Cheap

Yesterday's foreign currency market was getting worse and worse. This was because the foreign exchange rate was getting looser and the gold price had fallen to the 4,000 yuan mark. The general psychology towards the legal tender had changed greatly, and there was a further understanding, so everyone exchanged foreign currencies for legal tender. The market result yesterday was that only the Singapore ticket and the Netherlands ticket each rose by one corner, while the British gold pound fell by one yuan, and the American gold pound also fell by five corners. The American gold ticket initially traded at 13.3 yuan, and then gradually fell to 13.1 yuan. Near noon, it recovered slightly to 13.2 yuan, and finally closed at 13.05 yuan, a small decline of 2.5 corners. The Hong Kong ticket was initially equal to the Guangzhou ticket, and then fell by 0.02 yuan. The French franc ticket was 0.003 yuan less, the Canadian ticket was 0.5 yuan lower, the Philippine ticket was 0.2 yuan lower, the Italian ticket was 0.18 yuan lower, the Japanese gold ticket was also 0.008 yuan less, and the Korean ticket was 0.01 yuan lower. The rest remained unchanged.

### Hong Kong Merchants are Watching, The Gold Price is Falling More Fiercely, Once Breaking the 4,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's spot gold grey market continued to decline, and the downward trend was even fiercer. It once broke into the 4,000 yuan mark before the evening close. This was because there was a certain atmosphere in the market, which led to the foreign exchange rate becoming looser. Therefore, the bullish thinking on gold was extraordinarily pessimistic. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants showed poor digestion and needed to stop abruptly, unlike the crazy swallowing and indiscriminate acceptance of the past few days. This newspaper once predicted that the main factor for the gold price to fall into the 4,000 yuan mark was also. Furthermore, some retail bulls also came to the market to close their positions, so the market showed a scattered and weak atmosphere. However, although there were many twists and turns in the middle, there was no fear of raising prices at all, and on the contrary, selling was extremely easy to fall, and the downward trend could not be stopped, and there was still fear that there would be no rebound in the future for the time being. In the past, the market opened weakly in the morning to 4,045 yuan. Subsequently, due to the loosening of foreign exchange and the emergence of a certain gold number bull and the securities gang following the sale, it was pressed down slightly to 4,012 yuan. Later, due to the disappearance of buyers, it broke the 4,000 yuan mark. Trading was still strong, about 1,000 taels. Silver building ornaments were listed for 5 yuan less, and customs gold, etc. were still stable.

Spot Gold Fell 53 Yuan

Since the morning, every bar (10 taels) initially opened with weak popularity. A certain gold number, etc. had a supply intention. The opening price was 8 yuan less than before the holiday (i.e. Monday this week). A certain gold number sold 20 taels to the securities gang, with the price being 4,045 yuan. After opening, it was heard that foreign exchange was loose and the situation was weak again. Sellers came one after another, and a certain gold number had a strong willingness to sell, and continued to fall by 15 yuan. A certain gold number sold 30 taels to the same industry, for 4,030 yuan. After this, a certain securities gang also started a selling trend, immediately selling more than 100 taels, and then pressing down 18 yuan again. The securities gang sold 20 taels to the silver building gang, with the price being 4,012 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange turned tight, which stimulated people's hearts. In addition, a certain securities gang stopped selling and reversed. It soon returned to a high of 16 yuan. Money changers did 20 taels of mutual business, with the price being 4,028 yuan. Then, a certain gold number and silver building gang took the opportunity to sell, and once again fell to 4,015 yuan. Later, because a certain securities gang still had a buying interest, and a certain money changer also came to follow up, it was pulled up by 20 yuan again. Money changers did 30 taels of mutual business, for 4,035 yuan. Nearing noon, it was heard that foreign exchange was loose, and the selling atmosphere was surging for a while. Money changers, etc. tended to sell, and in addition, there was a lack of buyers, and it fell sharply by 21 yuan. The money changer sold to the gold number [] taels, for 4,014 yuan as the noon closing price. The opening was still even in the afternoon. Initially, the money changer sold 10 taels to the gold number, for 4,015 yuan. Following this, the securities gang advanced 20 taels to the money changer, for 4,018 yuan. Later, because the silver building gang frequently came to sell, and floating bulls also entrusted the market's mobile brokers to close their positions according to the market, the mountain trend could not support the decline, and it broke the 4,000 yuan mark. The silver building gang sold 20 taels to the money changer, with the price being 3,995 yuan. After entering, retail investors came to resume advancing slightly, immediately returning 10 yuan. Money changers did 30 taels of mutual business, with the price being 4,005 yuan. Later, the silver building gang came to sell 20 taels to the gold number again, for 4,000 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it continued to fall by 53 yuan compared to before the holiday. The whole day fluctuated by 50 yuan. The selling price of the spot gold number's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase was reduced by about 30 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few transactions.

Ornamental Gold Listed for 5 Yuan Less

The initial exchange rate for gold jewelry per tael in silver buildings was still 410 yuan for Datong Bank. When it came to noon, the spot gold fell weakly, so it was also listed for 5 yuan less. There were no changes after this. Datong Bank changed to 405 yuan, the new bank and the upper price were the same, and the purchase must be reduced by 20 yuan.

### Securities Good News is Frequently Reported, Public Debt is Soaring

The difference between A and C grades reached 10 yuan Each debt rose by 6-7 yuan

Buying Foreign Stocks is Still Strong

Yesterday's securities grey market situation, the rising trend is getting stronger and stronger, and all gangs are becoming more enthusiastic about going long. Grade B actually broke through the 50 yuan mark, but it is a pity that it could not be stabilized. Grade A rose by 2.5 yuan, and the difference with Grade C has reached over 10 yuan. In recent days, various debts have turned for the better due to the frequent reports of victory in the Xiang War, and have soared by 5, 6, and 7 yuan. The market is very excited about covering short positions and going long. At present, the bulls are gradually satisfied, and the short sellers who are floating and unreal are painfully hedging, and it is also necessary to pay attention to the fact that the discount market has fallen by nearly 100 yuan in recent days, that is, the exchange rate of the draft has risen by 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The public price is traded in exchange rate, that is, its price has invisibly risen by 10%. Therefore, the current price is similar to the previous highest price in terms of wheeling. And the current market price continues to rise, and there should be a reversal in theory, that is, from the perspective of the strength of both buyers and sellers yesterday, it is already weaker than before. Yongkang has always been selling, and Shengda Xingguang Tiansheng Xieda Yuankang Yongfeng may be box traders or selling on high, while the buyers are only retail investors except for Daqing Hongkang Lianyi. As a result of the market price, Grade A rose by as much as 2.45 yuan, and the rest also rose by 0.75 yuan to 0.9 yuan. The total number of transactions is estimated to be 1.4-1.5 million yuan. Here is a brief list of stocks

Stock trading: 70 shares of Bank of China were traded, with the price being 53.5 yuan, which was 0.5 yuan better than before.

Yesterday's stock market in the Public Exchange, Jardine Matheson's opening was like a gust of wind and rain. The price jumped to 58.5 yuan within half an hour. The number of transactions was only 1,500 shares. After a while, the sellers became active, and the price slowly fell to 53 yuan. At this time, the number of transactions was extremely large. Later, the buyer's assistance came again, and the price returned to 57.5 yuan. The closing bid price was 55 yuan, and the selling price was 56.5 yuan. The Jardine Matheson Spinning Mill stock was relatively loose, and the price was lower than when it rose sharply the previous day. There were few changes in other stocks.

The total number of transactions yesterday was extremely large, and the market potential seemed to have not declined. The large amount of funds recently invested in various stocks are mostly spot transactions. Unless the operators have more opportunities to use their funds in the future, they will temporarily treasure the goods they have received and will not seek to sell them immediately.

### Food Rice Prices Plummet This is What Should Have Happened Both Local Rice and Indica Rice Have Been Bumper Harvests

After the rice market was closed for one day on Double Tenth Festival, 6-7,000 bags of new and old goods arrived in the past two mornings. Therefore, people's hearts were empty in the early market. Under the continuous downward trend in the past few mornings, no one dared to buy more, and transactions were sluggish. The hands of various passenger peddlers had a lot of goods, and most of them were new goods with weak bones, so it was difficult to defend them for a long time. Therefore, they threw them out one after another, and the price was lowered all the way. Until the closing, only 4-5,000 bags were transacted, and the new glutinous rice market fell more fiercely than before the festival, reaching 1-3 yuan. With kiln-grown Bai Ge, most cargo owners were even more eager to sell due to the sultry weather in recent days. From the initial call of 30 yuan, it dropped straight to 26-27 yuan, a huge drop of 4-5 yuan compared to the previous morning. Yanglu tip also fell by about 2 yuan, the passenger tip was reduced by 1.5 yuan due to the small bottom plate, and the Bian Yuan was also reduced by 1-2 yuan. The trading price of Changxi Bai Po was 32-33 yuan, Zhong was 31-30 yuan, Xin Geng was 29 yuan, Sutong Po was 30 yuan, 29.5 yuan, Xin Geng was initially 29 yuan, and later only 27 yuan, Qingjiao Kiln species was 28-29 yuan, [] Jing Bai Ge was 26-27 yuan, Nangang Bai Dao was 27 yuan, Yangjian Special was 23 yuan, the next was 21 yuan, Lujian was 23.5 yuan, to 22 yuan, Jiangbei tip was 18 yuan, the next was 17 yuan, Wu tip Special was 18 yuan, [] was to 17 yuan, [] tip was 16.5 yuan, to 16 yuan, Nanjing Special tip was 18.5 yuan, [] was to 17.5 yuan, Bian Yuan Chen was 31-32 yuan, Xin was 27-28 yuan, [] was to 26.5 yuan,

Attached News: The Rice Market Management Committee, in view of the fact that the new goods in various districts have been entering the market year by year, and the market business is booming, it is necessary to rectify the market business rules. Therefore, the Market Management Committee drafted a report to the Bean and Rice Industry Association for review, inviting seven rice industry groups to attend the meeting. It was decided to establish the Rice Merchant Industry Tea Party Market Temporary Trading Rules, which will be implemented from October 16, 1939. If there is anything that is not perfect, it can be revised at any time. Yesterday, the Market Management Committee printed and published the rules to inform all rice merchants to abide by them. (Already seen in the local news a few days ago)

Customer Indica Rice Arrival Continues, and Whole Batches from Jiangbei Arrive at the Port, and the Beijing-Wu area is also continuing to transport by Japanese merchants. At present, the Shanghai market has plummeted again and again, but there are still many purchases and storage by dealers in the production area, and the production price has also fallen recently. Therefore, in the future, not only will the goods on the way arrive in Shanghai one after another, but the subsequent transportation will not be silent. Moreover, this year's Geng Xiang and E production is even more abundant. Hubei Province and Xiangbei various roads of brown rice have gradually come to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Hunan Bei brown rice loaded from Hankou opened at 14.5 yuan, and the Beijing Wu brown rice was only about 15 yuan. Machine-milled passenger indica rice was affected by the new glutinous rice and the new tip plummeted, and the market was still difficult to support. Yesterday, it fell again by more than 1.5 yuan, and the high passenger indica rice was only 18.7-8 corners, and the middle [] was from 18 yuan to 17 yuan.

### Flour Mills are Gradually Clearing Floating Warehouse Receipts

The flour customer transaction is quite lively. This is because Qingdao Gang and Nanyang Port Gang and other customer sales are gradually showing motives. In terms of this street, the factory price is higher than the redeemed goods, and most of them are bought in small quantities in the market. At present, the floating warehouse receipts in the market are gradually being cleared. There are also many who transfer out of the factory warehouse, so people's hearts are becoming more stable, and the selling is tight. It is heard that Cannon Powder is scarce and has been raised to 6.95 yuan. Battleship and Red and Blue Fuxin prices opened at 6.6-7 corners. Soon, it may be equal to the factory price. A total of 40-50,000 bags were transacted in the unified market. 2,550 bags of flour were shipped to Xiamen on the 12th, and 3,000 bags were shipped to Zhigang.

The wheat market is also said to be tight. In recent days, the arrival sources in Shanghai and Ningbo have continued, but the cargo side has the intention of deducting due to the low cost and the difficulty in succeeding the foreign wheat. Furthermore, the flour sales are slightly moving, and the factory appetite is also more than before. The hoarders also have a little embellishment. The unified market is jointly organized by Fuxin and Fufeng two factories, with 4-5,000 bags of various wheat, and the hoarders advance 5 cars, the highest price being 10 yuan, and [] being 9.6 corners. 90 bags of wheat were shipped to Xiamen on the 12th.

### Yarn and Cotton Cotton Yarn is Falling, Shuangma Enters the 700 Yuan Mark

The yarn market continued to fall, and the downward trend was not good. The actual demand was too sluggish, and many floating amounts were confused and unsettled, and there were many people who were unreliable. Therefore, the market situation continued to decline. The 20-count Shuangma spot once broke through the 700 yuan mark. Once this mark was broken, a new buying trend suddenly arose. Some have the intention of falling cheap, and the market price reappeared outside the 700 yuan mark. The current situation is that new gestures must be discovered when the actual transaction develops. However, the degree of decline has been deep, and the force of rebound must not be prevented.

Now the yarn business is silent, and everyone mostly folds their hands and does not move. Delayed until 9:50, a certain number sold, the 20-count Shuangma spot price was 710 yuan, down 8 yuan, and the warehouse receipt broke the 700 yuan mark, at 695 yuan. At this time, the market situation was weak and the popularity was chaotic. A certain gentleman has always been enthusiastic about pulling up, but now his speech has become loose and he is selling, so people's hearts are even weaker, falling by 5 yuan. The spot also broke the 700 yuan mark, with the warehouse receipt price being 675 yuan. Then, a certain someone came to absorb suddenly, and then recovered again. The half-day transaction statistics were 1,115 packages, the 20-count Shuangma market fell 9 yuan, the Shuangdiqiu fell 8 yuan, the Tiannv fell 18 yuan, and the 10-count coarse yarn also fell 10 yuan. Today, 65 pieces of cotton yarn are shipped to Xiamen, 20 pieces are shipped to Hong Kong, 20 pieces are shipped to [] Guangzhou Bay, 10 pieces are shipped to Beihai, and 4 pieces are shipped to Haikou. The amount of purchase by each gang is listed on the left,

### Manufacturers Stop, Tonghua Falls Again

This cotton transaction has turned silent. The manufacturer's yarn market is small and the sales are sluggish. As for the peers, they are also watching, so the transaction has been greatly reduced. The market price has fallen, and Tongzhou cotton has fallen again by 4 yuan, but those with superior body strength are still even, but goods with moisture are much cheaper. A total of 4,783 packages arrived from Subei in two days. Today, there are 295 packages of exported cotton

US Cotton Argentina 182.00

Tongzhou 135.00 136.00

Another news: The Shanghai port foreign cotton transaction has recently been caused by various rumors on the cloth, and speculators have sold their foreign exchange, so the exchange rate has increased and the prices of various commodities have also fallen sharply. Raw cotton has also been sluggish in yarn sales, and the price has not been able to rise for many days. Recently, due to the sharp loosening of the exchange rate, foreign cotton has been deserted. The peers have also cut out regardless of the cheap price at this time. Recently, the arrival of Tonghua has also been the reason for the drop in the price of foreign cotton.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was very quiet in the early morning. The government's report was less than generally expected, so the market situation turned firm. However, the bulls took profits and offset each other. Subsequently, speculators suddenly bought in the market, and some peers and overseas cotton merchants bought, and as a result, the market price rose by 8-9 pounds over the previous day. Indian cotton cloth was quite stable. Yesterday, including the forecast, there was not much difference. Egypt rose by the remaining pounds, and Liverpool fell by 9 pence.

Washington Electric: The US Cotton Fourth Decision Government estimates that the output is 11,928,000 bales, which is 452,000 bales less than the 12,380,000 bales of the previous session.

### Silk and Tea Factory Business Has Been Transacted

- -The Export Silk Price Has Shrunk Invisibly-- Recently, foreign silk has been flat and lifeless. New York Japanese silk fell by 1-2 points, the near term rose by 1 point, and the far term fell by 3.5 points. The Yokohama spot has been fluctuating on the 1,600 yuan line for the past ten days. The situation turned stable yesterday. The spot price is estimated to have risen by 25 yuan, and the delivery price is expected to rise by 14 yuan. However, the exchange rate has improved in recent days, and the export price of raw silk has shrunk invisibly. Therefore, the distance between domestic and foreign silk prices will inevitably be farther. However, this phenomenon can stimulate silk sales on the other hand. Therefore, the White Factory has already had transactions yesterday. The price of White Factory 78 points is 4,250 yuan, and the price of 75 points is 4,050 yuan. It is estimated that 60 dan have been made. The silk price is about 50 yuan less than at the beginning of the month. Indian African silk sales are still sluggish, and the price of local silk is falling in secret. Fortunately, the recent outstanding transactions in central work have pulled back a lot of the slump.

### Cotton Cloth Buyers Dare Not Take Action Rashly

National Cloth

Yesterday, the cloth market was inclined to sell the scattered group goods of the same crowd and customer gangs, and the buyers saw that the market price was depreciating rapidly and did not dare to take action rashly. The number of transactions was extremely sporadic. In the morning market, white goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth continued to drop by 0.1-0.3 yuan per piece, and bleaching and dyeing [] handling also fell by 0.25-0.5 yuan. The market price was quite chaotic. In the post-market, Dongsha rebounded, and the real needs of the houses in this street took advantage of the cheap absorption, and the old market instantly returned to 0.05-0.15 yuan. The transaction was slightly stronger. A total of more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill were transacted on the entire Japanese street, and more than 250 boxes of velvet bleached and dyed printed cloth were transacted. The Cantonese gang handled 50 bags of 9-pound and 14-pound coarse cloth, and more than 2,000 pieces of wool flannel tribute satin velvet were transacted. The Guangdong, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and inland gangs were all sluggish in demand for goods such as blue cloth, yuan twill, red foreign standard, bleached cloth, and printed cloth in Singapore, Mumbai, and other places abroad.

### Metals Pure Antimony Nears 7,000 Yuan

Since pure antimony reached 6,000 yuan, the Tianjin group purchased 30 tons from the market yesterday, and the Qingdao and Yantai groups also purchased more than 10 tons. It is noted that the goods in the market are very scarce, and almost no goods are shipped out of Hunan, resulting in a rare commodity that can be hoarded. At this moment, it is nearly 7,000 yuan, which is also about 1,000 yuan higher than before. However, because the market situation is excellent and people's expectations are high, it should not be difficult for the market to improve further.

### Grains New Sesame Seeds Sell Well

Yesterday, the market situation of new sesame seeds in the grain market was generally sluggish due to the continuous arrival of various sources. Sales from this street in Guangzhou are still active, with a total of 324 packages of Yangzhou white sesame seeds sold at 28.5 yuan and 27 yuan, 300 packages of Hankou white sesame seeds sold at 31 yuan, 50 packages of Guandian white sesame seeds sold at 33.5 yuan, and 150 packages of Anqing white sesame seeds sold at 31.2 yuan.

### The Double Tenth Festival Passed Peacefully, Fundraising for Winter Clothing Extremely Enthusiastic, Banks Were Quite Busy Yesterday Collecting Payments in Lieu, Expected to Raise the Full Amount Before the End of the Month

The Puppet "Police Bureau" in West Shanghai Displayed the Qing Bai Flag on National Day

According to Continental News, the 28th Double Tenth Festival of the Republic of China passed peacefully, with no major unexpected events. Only one Chinese coolie was shot dead by Japanese sentries near the Bang of Xujiahui Road. National flags fluttered over shops and residences in both concessions, and most Chinese and foreign businesses were closed. The national flag was also displayed on some houses occupied by the puppet regime, such as the "Special Task Force" headquarters of the "Avenue" Police Bureau and some "Avenue" branch police stations.

Puppet "Police Bureau" Flag Display Situation

Regarding the discovery of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag at the headquarters and branch police stations of the Great Avenue, although no direct explanation was obtained last night, observers believe that this is by no means a manifestation of patriotism. They believe that the main purpose of the "Avenue" personnel displaying the flag is to show a friendly attitude to the genuine patriotic Chinese residing in the road area outside the concession. Although Japanese military police appeared around the branch police stations, the flags were still flying high, and some were not taken down until dusk. The office established by Wang Jingwei supporters in the central area of the Public Concession also flew the national flag.

Western District Police Affairs Particularly Tense

The number of patrols by the Public Concession Police Department on the roads outside the boundary of the Western District has increased, and the puppet police, in addition to directing traffic on the roads outside the boundary, also carry rifles and patrol. Inspection teams from the Police Department are stationed at the intersections of Jessfield Road, Edinburgh Road, Haig Road, Yu Yuen Road, and Edinburgh Road. Caojiadu is completely controlled by "Avenue" police in groups of five.

Xujiahui Bang Shooting Incident

The shooting incident at Xujiahui Bang was not explained yesterday. According to eyewitnesses, at 6:30 yesterday morning, a Chinese man dressed as a coolie tried to cross the Bang and was stopped by a Japanese sentry on the Nanshi side. The Chinese man turned back, but the Japanese sentry shot him, and the Chinese man died on the spot. The body was then removed by the French Concession Bureau.

Fundraising for Winter Clothing Continues

The National Winter Clothing Fundraising Movement Committee decided to expand the fundraising for 3 million pieces of winter clothing on the Double Tenth Festival. After the Shanghai Fundraising Branch actively carried out the fundraising through various industries and student groups, thanks to the enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, the results have exceeded 100,000 yuan. The students of various schools took advantage of the holiday the day before yesterday to go out and raise winter clothing enthusiastically. However, various groups believe that as autumn is approaching, the northern war zone has already been frozen, and the soldiers urgently need winter clothing. Therefore, they decided to continue fundraising to achieve the predetermined goal of exceeding 200,000 yuan in payments in lieu. People from all walks of life who have not encountered fundraisers can send the payments in lieu directly to the national banks in the city for collection and remittance. Yesterday was the first day of business resumption after the Double Tenth Festival holiday for the national banks. From morning to night, they were particularly busy collecting payments in lieu for winter clothing from all walks of life, which showed the enthusiasm of all walks of life in Shanghai for participating in the winter clothing movement. It is reported that more than half of the 200,000 yuan in payments in lieu for winter clothing have already been raised, and the full amount is expected to be raised before the end of the month.

Various Industries and Markets Resumed Business Yesterday Morning

Following the usual practice of taking a day off on National Day, the silver and money industry and various industries and markets in the city, including banks, money houses, foreign exchange black markets, gold, securities dark markets, and markets for miscellaneous grains, flour, cotton yarn, rice, and coal, all resumed business yesterday morning and handled collection, settlement, and various transaction businesses as usual. The joint reserve of banks, the clearing house for negotiable instruments, and the joint reserve of the money industry have all resumed operations yesterday. It is reported that after the resumption of business in various markets yesterday, foreign exchange continued to ease, gold fell slightly, public bonds soared, and the discount rate fell, and the situation improved consistently, and the market remained stable.

### Northern District of Suzhou Creek Situation Stable

After passing the National Day under strict guard, the situation in the northern district of Suzhou Creek eased slightly yesterday. The three Japanese sentry posts added at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazhi Road have been removed. At the gap between North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road and Wenjianshi Road, the Japanese military no longer need to search pedestrians who show their passes. The Japanese-established anti-epidemic injection station at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road has been removed. According to residents of the district, the Japanese military notified residents at the end of last month that after the 10th of this month, they must hold an anti-epidemic certificate to obtain a residence permit before they can live in the district, but as of yesterday, the Japanese military has not yet implemented this measure.

### Soviet Consulate Closed, All Matters Entrusted to the Norwegian Consul for Care, Procedures for Foreigners to Go to the Soviet Union All Under Norwegian Consulate, Consulates in Tianjin and Peiping Also Closed Simultaneously

According to Continental News, it was learned yesterday (9th) that all affairs of the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai have been entrusted to the Norwegian Consul-General, Mr. Niutecheng, for care. It is noted that the Soviet Consulate moved from the temporary building on Shanzhong Road to the official building at No. 20 Huangpu Beach ten days ago. However, since Soviet Consul Konstantinnov, accompanied by Vice-Consul Qiming and Consular Secretary Kolomeizev, took a boat to Japan on September 24, the Soviet Consulate has been empty. The consulate building is currently being looked after by Shaliyev. Although the purpose of Konstantinnov and others going to Tokyo has not been disclosed, it is generally believed that they may have been sent to Japan to complete the preparatory technical work for the recent ceasefire between the Soviet Union and Japan on the Outer Mongolian border. It is widely believed that after they complete their mission in Tokyo, they will set off directly for Moscow.

Norwegian Consul Takes Over Everything

According to the China Press, a senior official of the Norwegian Consulate stated last night (10th) that the Norwegian Consulate-General has taken over the consular duties of Soviet citizens in Shanghai since a few days ago, and has notified Soviet citizens that they must apply to the Norwegian Consulate-General for passports and other matters in the future. When asked about the reason for this move, the official said that he only knew that he had received instructions from the Norwegian government to take care of Soviet interests in Shanghai, and that he would know more after receiving further notice. It is also reported that there are currently no responsible Soviet consular officials in Shanghai, as the consulate staff left for the Soviet Union two weeks ago. Therefore, foreigners who wish to travel through the Soviet Union in the future must go through various procedures at the Norwegian Consulate-General.

Rumored to Affect Soviet-Japanese Relations

According to foreign sources, the Soviet government, due to different opinions with Japan on the China issue, is becoming increasingly hostile and has decided to close the consulates in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping, and entrust the interests of Russian expatriates to the Norwegian consuls in the above-mentioned places for management. In the occupied areas of China, only one consulate is still set up in Harbin. According to inquiries from reliable sources in the diplomatic circles by the reporter yesterday morning, it has been confirmed.

It is learned that the Soviet and Norwegian Consulates in Shanghai suddenly received instructions from Moscow and Oslo on the 9th of this month, respectively, entrusting all diplomatic affairs of the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai to the Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai for management. As a result, after a meeting between the personnel of the two consulates, the diplomatic affairs of the Soviet Consulate were entrusted to the Norwegian Consulate for agency from the day before yesterday. After this news spread, all parties considered it important, and some even regarded it as a sign of the future international situation. Therefore, some foreign diplomats observed that this decision by the Soviet Union's diplomatic action may open up a new path, or at least its diplomatic policy towards the Far East may be re-adjusted. Therefore, they are all closely watching its future development. According to reliable sources, although the Soviet Union is not a signatory country to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it abides by the spirit of the two and firmly safeguards China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Recently, the Japanese side's request for the Soviet Union to stop aiding China has been sternly rejected by the Soviet government. In view of the increase in troops by both the Soviet Union and Japan on the Mongolian-Manchurian border, it is deeply believed that the temporarily eased Soviet-Japanese relations may become tense again, and the ceasefire agreement on the Mongolian-"Manchukuo" border will fall into the same fate as the Zhanggufeng ceasefire.

### US Amends Neutrality Act, Opinions of American僑 in Shanghai, Regarding the Matter of US Ships Not Being Allowed to Approach Shanghai, Will Telegraph Washington to Urge Consideration of the Facts

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, Senator Pittman's amendment to the Neutrality Act has now been submitted to the US Senate for discussion. American侨 in Shanghai are frequently discussing the possibility that Pittman's bill may warn American ships not to approach Shanghai, and it is hoped that the American侨 will have a concrete form of opinion on what kind of response action to take this afternoon (11th). Generally, American僑 believe that Pittman's bill currently stands to use American law to prohibit American ships from sailing to ports where American commerce is prosperous, such as Hong Kong and Singapore. The reporter asked the main leaders of American commerce in Shanghai today about this matter. It is said, "We still plan to do business here, and we may telegraph Washington today to ask them to remember this fact." Another American businessman said, "What must be done must be done quickly." Another American businessman said, "If it is decided to send a telegram, the telegram will point out that if complete restrictions are imposed in accordance with the bill, the only countries that American ships can trade with are Hawaii, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies." He believes that there is no real reason why Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore should be prohibited from sailing. Since a US fleet is stationed in the East, American merchant ships should also be allowed to enter Eastern ports so that American merchant ships can be obtained when necessary. This is particularly important. According to Continental News, American僑 in Shanghai were greatly troubled last night (10th) by the provision in Senator Pittman's bill to abolish the US arms embargo that restricts US shipping.

American merchants and trading and shipping companies fear that the result of Pittman's bill in its current form will eventually restrict American ships from coming to Shanghai. Although Pittman's bill, if passed by the US Congress, may not be implemented in the very near future, American僑 in Shanghai do not take chances and are currently working to contact senators and congressmen in the US capital to ease the restrictions on US shipping. Three American merchant houses in Shanghai have notified their US headquarters that certain provisions are indeed needed in Pittman's bill that can eliminate the possibility of restricting American ships from sailing to Shanghai. Shanghai has already received news of future restrictions, or that American ships will be prohibited from sailing to Hong Kong, so it is no wonder that American people in Shanghai felt panicked last night. According to shipping industry sources, it is not difficult to imagine that Hong Kong, as a British port, restricts American ships from sailing there, but the possible restriction of American shipping to Shanghai is a bit more complicated. American僑 in Shanghai believe that according to Pittman's bill, or even the provisions of the current Neutrality Act, President Roosevelt has the right to point out which country is the aggressor in any war. In President Roosevelt's recent remarks, he has already clarified that he recognizes Germany as the aggressor in Europe, so if President Roosevelt points out Germany, there is a possibility that he will point out Japan as the aggressor in China. If President Roosevelt does so, it is reasonable to expect that Shanghai will be included in the list of ports of belligerent countries, and Tianjin may also be included in it, because the surrounding areas of Shanghai and Tianjin are all in the Japanese-occupied areas. Therefore, if Pittman's bill is not amended in the Far East, several ports in the Far East, including Shanghai, will be affected. American侨 in Shanghai considered the results yesterday and expect to agree on action soon, telegraphing their domestic headquarters, and even telegraphing senators and congressmen, requesting that Pittman's bill be amended to allow American ships to travel in non-combat zones and areas controlled by belligerent countries.

### Chinese Students Studying in the United States Devote Themselves to Serving the Motherland, Giving Speeches at Any Time to Promote the War of Resistance Against Japan, and Gaining Respect and Support from the People of That Country

According to Continental News, Mr. Zhao (transliteration), the former general secretary of the United Christian Association of Chinese Students in North America, returned to China in early October after attending the World Christian Youth Conference in Amsterdam. Yesterday, he told reporters that the 2,400 Chinese students studying in the United States, known as "Ambassadors of Goodwill," are engaged in cultivating better relations between China and the United States, and also turning to the American people to explain domestic events, which is of great help to the work of Chinese envoys to the United States. Their service to China is actually better than that of official Chinese representatives. Among the 2,400 Chinese students studying in the United States, women from various departments of China and Hawaii account for more than a quarter. They are not only good at socializing, but also knowledgeable and respected. At a time when the motherland is at war, Chinese students studying in the United States give speeches at any time to promote fundraising to help the poor and wounded soldiers, and write articles to publish various aspects of the motherland's war. According to a survey conducted by the Association last spring, there has been a significant decrease in the number of Chinese students studying in the United States who are studying social sciences that are less practical than before, especially political science, while the number of students studying various engineering subjects is the largest, including 69 who specialize in aviation. This is because what China needs are engineering military students and technical experts.

### Japanese Side Seizes Ships, Paints Over Ship Names and Flags, Action Is Suspicious, Intentions Are Obvious to Everyone, Portuguese Merchants Have the Most Ships Detained

Also Detained Two Chinese Sailing Ships and One Small Motorboat

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, Japanese maritime authorities have taken a series of puzzling actions since this year, seizing ships without giving reasons and detaining them directly at Zhoujiazui. Yesterday (10th), they began painting, which made their actions even more suspicious. According to eyewitnesses along the Huangpu River yesterday, the focus of the painting method being implemented is related to the nationality of the twelve Jianglun ships that were detained, as they are painting over the flags painted on both sides of the ships with white paint. Eyewitnesses also said that they saw the Japanese side paying special attention to the Portuguese ship Deyao, which was only detained last Thursday, with about five people engaging in painting over the Portuguese flag on both sides of the ship. Similar attention was also given to other ships. It is reported that the Deyao ship was seized on its way back from the Yangtze River Estuary last Thursday morning. This is the seventh Portuguese ship seized by the Japanese maritime authorities. Among the other ships, there are three German ships and two Italian ships, most of which were seized in March. The relevant foreign authorities have begun negotiations with the Japanese side, but they have not yet reached a resolution after continuing consultations. This matter was also discussed when the Japanese side in Shanghai received newspaper reporters. A Japanese naval spokesman forcefully stated that the ships would be released. The spokesman later said that these ships belonged to Chinese merchants and only flew foreign flags for protection. It is reported that the Portuguese Permanent Bureau in Shanghai has protested to the Japanese side against this attitude, asserting that the ships seized by the Japanese maritime authorities belonged to Portuguese merchants and had been registered with the Portuguese Consulate in Shanghai. The ships currently detained by the Japanese side include the Portuguese ships Tanglu, Tangbei, Tangqi, Deyao, Telago, Marimageshitai, and Lotai (the latter three ships are all transliterated). According to news this morning, the Lotai has been sold to the Japanese last week. The German ships are Datay and Huijin (both transliterated). The Italian ships still detained include Fesitai and Faluo (both transliterated). The small motorboat Liv (transliterated) of a Swedish company in Shanghai is now also detained in the same place as other ships.

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Japanese maritime authorities continued their seizure activities yesterday (9th), which they had repeatedly seized ships several days ago, and detained two Chinese sailing ships and a small motorboat moored in Peijiang near the Jiangbin Power Plant of the Ten Seas Power Company this morning (the previous day). According to bystanders, there were a total of twelve people on the three boats. When the Japanese maritime authorities ordered them to sail away with them in a small boat, they did not resist and sailed downstream, mooring on the Pudong side opposite the Qiujiang Wharf. The ships previously "captured" by the Japanese side were also moored there. It is reported that the small motorboat detained this morning previously belonged to the Japanese, and was later sold to the Russians or Germans, but the name of the boat and its current owner are not known for sure. It is reported that the Portuguese ship Deyao was seized by the Japanese maritime authorities when it returned to Shanghai from the Yangtze River Estuary last week and has been detained at Zhoujiazui. Three more sailing ships were detained yesterday and banned in the same location. It is reported that the port authorities in Shanghai did not know when the Japanese maritime authorities detained the ships, and the reason for their actions was not explained.

### Ding Xishan's 部 Recaptures Cangdun

Rumor That Ding Himself Was Kidnapped Has Not Yet Been Confirmed

It is rumored that Ding Xishan was kidnapped to Hongkou on his way to Shanghai a few days ago and has not yet been released, with the condition of forcing his subordinates to surrender as a condition for his release. However, Ding's subordinates, the 8th Detachment of the Loyal National Salvation Army, have been fighting unyieldingly for two years, so they decided to refuse and continue to carry out the work of saving the country. According to news from the coastal shipping circles in Punan, Ding Xishan's subordinates fought fiercely with the Japanese army in the coastal salt area on the night of the 8th. Because of the large number of people and their advantageous position, they recaptured one of the four major salt warehouses that had been lost, namely Cangdun. The Japanese army was forced to retreat, and they continued to recapture the other three major salt warehouses of Zhaolin, Ping'anle, and Qianjiaqiao, recovering rich salt taxes. Therefore, the victory on the evening of the 8th was nothing less than a prelude to celebrating the National Day.

### US Ship Heron Encountered Danger in South China

According to Continental News, the US Asian Fleet flagship Augusta will sail to the South China Sea tomorrow morning (12th) in response to the distress call issued by the minesweeper Heron. The officers and soldiers of the ship will not be allowed to take leave to go ashore from today (11th). According to news from Shanghai, the Heron encountered a strong wind shifting northward outside Taiwan, causing it to lose its mine-laying frame and suffer in that area. It is currently searching for the mine-laying frame and requesting assistance from the Augusta. It is reported that the Augusta will return to Shanghai as soon as the search is completed. It is also reported that the Heron was not severely damaged and can still sail on its own.

### Hurricanes Rise One After Another in the Pacific Ocean

A new hurricane rising in the Pacific Ocean reached 33 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. The direction has turned due north and is now approaching Taiwan Island. The wind is strong. According to the astronomical observatory report, another new hurricane has risen in the Pacific Ocean. The position reached at 6:00 a.m. yesterday was 25 degrees north latitude and 133 degrees east longitude. The direction is north-northwest, and the wind force is unknown.

### Japanese Side Has Another Clever Explanation for Withdrawing from Zhongshan County, Saying That It Is Showing Respect for Sun Yat-sen and Trusts That the People of the County Can Govern Themselves

The Japanese naval spokesman said at the press briefing last night that the Japanese army withdrew from Zhongshan County, Guangdong, on the Double Tenth Festival to show respect for Prime Minister Sun because Zhongshan County is Prime Minister Sun's hometown. The Japanese army's occupation and withdrawal from Zhongshan County, due to the speed of action, has given the Chinese army a heavy blow, so the Japanese army has achieved a "brilliant victory." The spokesman continued, "There is another reason for the Japanese army to withdraw from Zhongshan County, that is, it trusts that the people of the county will be able to follow Prime Minister Sun's instructions, implement autonomy, and move forward on the path of anti-communism and pro-Japanese from now on. However, if Zhongshan County becomes a base for communism or is used for the Chinese army, the Japanese army will attack the area again and punish the local people." As of today, the Chinese army has never admitted to abandoning Zhongshan County. A Reuters dispatch from Zhongshan said that Zhang Huichang, the commander of the Chinese army there, was still commanding the army while wounded by shrapnel, which shows the intensity of the battle. According to a Chinese dispatch from Guilin on the 9th, the Japanese troops invading Zhongshan were severely attacked by the Chinese army and were blocked near Youqi, forming a confrontation. Zhongshan County is still in the hands of the Chinese army, which shows that the explanation of the Japanese naval spokesman has a clever effect.

On the 10th, the Japanese newspapers covered up the failure of the Japanese army to invade Changsha, saying that "the Japanese army used clever tactics to severely damage the party army in the Ninth War Zone, established brilliant results, and returned to the base with success." This decision is the reason for the Japanese side's statement to withdraw from Zhongshan County, which is similar to its clever action and is also to cover up its defeat.

### Feikang Ship Carries Passengers to Shanghai, Ningbo Goods Stop Loading

Due to Unresolved Exchange Settlement Issues

According to inquiries from the Datong News Agency, there are currently thirteen ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, including the German ships Moufu, Haifu, Hana, and Feikang, the Italian ships Ende, Deping, Baoli, and Haida, the British ships Yongtai and Yingzhou, and the Norwegian ships Dakang and Dapu, and the American ship Xin'anna. In addition, there are three kerosene ships operating between Shanghai and Ningbo, including American Nanzhou. However, since the Ningbo Zhejiang Customs issued a notice requiring the settlement of foreign exchange for local products transferred from Ningbo to Shanghai, the number of passengers and goods transported from Ningbo to Shanghai has decreased sharply. As a result, the Italian ship Ende and the American ship Xin'anna have withdrawn from the Shanghai-Ningbo line and changed to sail to Hong Kong and Xinghua. At the same time, the German ship Feikang, which returned to Shanghai from Zhen yesterday (10th), only carried passengers and did not load any goods. It is learned that the Ende ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday afternoon with few passengers and goods. It is now scheduled to change to sail to Hong Kong on the 14th. The Feikang ship is scheduled to continue to Zhen at 3:00 p.m. today. The Lihe and Moufu ships are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 13th, and the Hana ship may also arrive in Shanghai within a few days. If the exchange settlement issue is still not resolved when the two ships leave Zhen, they will only carry passengers and may not load local products. The cargo transportation of the Shanghai-Ningbo ships is significantly affected.

### Rice Prices Continue to Plummet Due to Abundant Arrivals

More Than 7,000 Packages Reached the Market, Prices of Various Goods Fell by 2 to 3 Yuan

The late rice in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, including Wuhu, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Changshu, has been harvested abundantly, and it is being transported to Shanghai for sale. The amount of rice and grain transported to Shanghai by land and water routes is increasing daily, and the inventory of rice shops in Shanghai is gradually increasing. The entire supply of staple food can be guaranteed, and the public's concerns have been dispelled. The business of rice shops has become quiet, and there are few retail buyers. However, all rice and grain transported to Shanghai from various places must hold so-called "transport permits," and they are only allowed to be transported to Shanghai after local taxes and levies have been collected on each stone. Otherwise, they will be detained. Therefore, the procedures for rice and grain to reach Shanghai are more complicated than in the past. The rice market was closed on the National Day holiday, and it reopened as usual at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The rice registered by cargo owners with the Rice Market Management Committee for consignment reached 7,620 packages, an increase of more than 2,200 packages compared with the rice registered for consignment on the 9th. Due to the large influx of goods and weak digestion, cargo owners are eager to sell, resulting in a drop of three yuan per stone for new japonica rice, with the highest price being 28 yuan per stone, and a drop of two yuan per stone for indica rice, with the highest price being 17 yuan per stone. Five or six boats from Hexia came yesterday, carrying more than seventy packages of steamed buns. According to an official of the Management Committee, the Market Management Committee is scheduled to convene a plenary committee meeting the day after tomorrow to prepare for the promulgation of the temporary regulations on market asset purchase, which were revised and approved by the seven rice industry groups at a joint meeting, on the 16th, and to discuss other proposals from various colleagues.

### French Concession Authorities Crack Down on German Intelligence Operations, Carefully Issue Various Licenses, Paying Attention to Those Impersonating German Jewish Refugees

The French Concession Municipal Council has now decided that applicants from German residents in the concession who are applying for building permits and business licenses must be carefully issued these licenses only after the authorities have investigated and considered the applications. The Municipal Council yesterday re-issued a notice to various departments within the council, ordering them to pay attention to German intelligence operations within the concession in order to reduce them. Due to this order, all residents holding German passports, including Jewish refugees who fled Germany due to political reasons, have been affected. However, the intention of the French authorities is not to restrict well-behaved German residents, so building and business licenses will be issued if, after individual examination, they are indeed deemed harmless. Since the influx of German Jewish refugees seeking asylum in Shanghai, no fewer than several thousand have opened businesses and made a living in the French Concession. The French authorities have expressed that they will not make things difficult for German Jewish residents who are settling down and working. However, it is heard that some non-Jewish Germans engaged in intelligence work are secretly adding a red "J" mark to their passports (note that the French authorities issue German Jewish passports with a "J" mark) in an attempt to impersonate German Jews. Therefore, the German authorities have no choice but to pay close attention to the investigation of German Jewish residents.

### Ten-Day Credit Loans Due, Money Shops Accommodate, Total Loans Amount to Approximately Ten Million Yuan, Overseas Interest Rates Rise Slightly by Two Points Starting Yesterday

The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial sectors' ten-day term transfers are approaching. The Standing Committee of the Money Industry Association resolved to convene a meeting of all executive committee members and managers of various shops at 2 PM on the 25th of this month to hold an "internal market conference" to decide the market rate for the ten-day period. Regarding the expiring credit loans, the shops agreed to the requests of various industries and have agreed to accommodate them. The borrowing firms and factories will negotiate with the shops themselves. The shops will try their best to undertake new credit loans, but only for national goods enterprises.

Loan Renewals, Interest Cleared

Since yesterday, various industries have been in contact with the shops regarding the funds. All will be completed by July 31st. Contracts for the extended loans will be renewed, but the interest must be fully cleared. New loans will establish new contracts, stating the date. It is heard that the total amount of the ten-day due loans from forty-one remittance money shops is ten million yuan in national currency. As for the entire Shanghai financial market, it remains stable as always.

Overseas Interest Rate Market, Considered Stable

Before the 9th of this month, the money market interest rate for next month's market was hovering within a few cents every day. Since yesterday, the morning and afternoon have opened at a rate of twenty-two cents, seeing the new prices from three months ago. However, compared to the previous years when various industries were at their peak, the overseas interest rate opened at two or three yuan, which is a big difference. It is also heard that the lists of long-term loan accounts for industrial and commercial enterprises from the money shops will be completely issued within the week.

Following Remittances, Consolidating Finance

Since receiving orders from the Ministry to stabilize finance and prevent capital flight, the leaders of the Shanghai banking and money industries, under the guidance of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, have implemented a new remittance system for the payment of notes. This has long been deeply recognized by various industries and domestic and foreign financiers, who unanimously follow it. Concentrating the existing funds, the financial market, which suffered from sabotage from certain parties, quickly turned for the better and is gradually consolidating. Since summer, various industries have been using the new remittance notes to pay and receive funds to each other, operating freely and showing a flexible state.

### Japanese Flagship Izumo Suddenly Weighs Anchor, Exited the Port the Day Before Yesterday, Destination Unknown

The Japanese Navy's Third Fleet flagship, Izumo, was berthed at the China Merchants Bureau pier in Hongkou. The ship suddenly weighed anchor and exited the port at 11 AM the day before yesterday (the 10th), destination unknown. The American ship Jsabel arrived in Shanghai at around 4 PM yesterday. When passing by the flagship Augusta, sailors from both sides saluted and exchanged messages using signal flags.

### Xiong Huan Takes Over as Director of the Municipal Council

The Japanese director of the Municipal Council, Sugi Saka, previously resigned due to leaving Shanghai to return to his country, and his resignation was approved. The vacant position has been filled by the Municipal Council hiring Japanese resident Xiong Huan. The position on the Finance Committee will also be held concurrently by Mr. Xiong.

### US Marine Corps to Hold Annual Founding Anniversary, Grand Review Ceremony on the 10th of Next Month, New Flags to be Presented by Commander-in-Chief Hurd

November 10th is the 160th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps. A grand review ceremony will be held at the racecourse in this city to celebrate. Admiral Hurd, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, plans to present the new regiment's flags to the soldiers of the US 4th Regiment, who will be wearing revolutionary war uniforms. The US Marine Corps currently stationed in Shanghai will be led by Colonel Fegan, and all members will be mobilized. At that time, Colonel Fegan will be at the head of the column, serving as the regiment commander, and Commander Hurd will review them. It is heard that this review ceremony is open to the public and military commanders, commanders, and consuls of various countries in Shanghai are invited to attend. No decision has been made yet. The design of the flags to be presented by Commander Hurd features a crimson center with an eagle perched on a circular line, slightly similar to the original old flags with a light color as the base.

### Considering the Hardships of Postal Workers, Subsidy Measures

Postmen Refuse to Accept Women, Increased Fees for Southeast Asian Airmail

The entire staff of the Shanghai Postal Administration previously requested subsidies from the bureau due to rising prices and difficult living conditions to maintain their current livelihoods. Subsequently, the bureau director, Mr. Cha Peilin, telegraphed the Kunming Postal Administration to explain the high cost of living in Shanghai and the difficulties faced by postal workers. Starting in July of this year, a uniform increase of 7.5 yuan per person per month was granted from grade B postal workers to letter carriers. Now, the Kunming Postal Administration, in consideration of the special environment in Shanghai and to alleviate the difficulties faced by postal workers, has ordered the Shanghai Postal Administration to further stipulate the following monthly subsidy measures for postal workers: (1) 1 yuan per month for postal workers, (2) 7.5 yuan per month for letter carriers, etc., (3) 3-4 yuan per month for laborers, depending on the hardship of each person's work (including the previous increase of 7.5 yuan). It is heard that these measures will be implemented starting this month.

Refuse to Accept Women

The General Postal Administration previously issued a notice stating that if the number of female employees in each administration exceeds 5% of the total number, no more female employees will be recruited in the future. The women's circles in Shanghai, believing that this would harm the future of women's careers, specifically telegraphed Madam Chiang and others, requesting the protection of women's rights. It is learned that after the Shanghai Postal Administration recruited junior postal workers on June 4th of this year, it stated that the number of female employees in the bureau had reached 6% of the total number. The second recruitment of junior postal workers, to be held on the 22nd of this month, will not accept any female applicants. However, the bureau currently has a total of 3,080 letter carrier employees, of which only 39 are female, and the number has not reached 5% of the total number. In addition to fighting for their rights with the bureau, the female employees are also appealing to the outside world for strong social assistance.

Southeast Asian Airmail

The Shanghai Postal Administration announced on the 11th that, starting immediately, for airmail destined for Indochina, British India, Malaya, Siam, Burma, India, and Iran, carried by British Royal Air Force planes departing from Hong Kong, the required additional airmail surcharge will be increased by 65 cents in national currency for every five grams. Airmail arriving from various western regions, carried by the company's Hanoi to Hong Kong segment of the plane, will also be increased in the same way. The notice is issued for general knowledge.

According to the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the exchange fee for Shantou postal remittances has been changed as follows: from now on, in addition to the one cent exchange fee, an additional two cent water subsidy fee will be charged for each yuan. The amount of remittances in each place will depend on the local situation.

### Foreign Faculty Members of Shanghai University Approved to Return to Their Former Residences, All Preparations are in Place for Regular Relocation, But When It Will Be Available for Application is Still Uncertain

The Continental Daily News reported yesterday (the 10th) that six foreign faculty members and their families at Shanghai University have made preparations to return to the Yangshupu campus of the school on the 14th of this month. Although adults in these families will return on the 14th, their children will not be traveling with them. Some of the children are already boarding at schools. A senior official at Shanghai University confirmed this statement yesterday. It is said that if the old site of Shanghai University is fully safe, then other personnel, including women, will soon follow them. According to Shanghai University personnel, although foreign faculty members are returning to the residences on the Yangshupu campus, the date when the school will be available for general use is still a long way off. Shanghai University withdrew from the Yangshupu campus when the Shanghai war was about to break out. After the Chinese army abandoned its defenses, the campus was occupied by the Japanese army. The school, owned by the American Church, has repeatedly protested through diplomatic channels, demanding the return of the property. At the beginning of this year, the Japanese side permitted school personnel to visit the campus to survey it. It was found that the campus was heavily damaged during the war, and most of the faculty residences and school equipment had been stolen. Thousands of books and other equipment that remained have been transported to the Public Concession.

### Explanation of President's "The Logic of Action" (Continued)

— Kong Lingkan

The driving force of "action" is sincerity, and the expression of "action" lies in creation, progress, construction, and the completion of the Three People's Principles revolution. The ultimate goal of "action" is "to sacrifice oneself for righteousness and to give up life for justice." The motivation of revolution is to save people, and the duty of revolution is to practice benevolence. To practice benevolence and obtain benevolence is the result of revolution. At the same time, scientific methods must be used, and attention must be paid to the four major elements of "action."

(1) There must be a starting point, a point for me to start from. Climbing high starts from below, traveling far starts from nearby. One cannot start beyond one's level and must start from the grassroots.

(2) There must be order. Plan thoroughly, set steps, and recognize the time, environment, and content of events to prepare in advance.

(3) There must be a purpose. Identify the purpose and do not stop until it is achieved.

(4) It must be continuous. Revolutionary action is just a plain and simple behavior, without the need for ingenious methods or speculative attempts.

After we understand the four major elements of "action," we can act, and only by being able to act can we talk about revolution.

Premier Sun Yat-sen invented the truth that "knowing is difficult, acting is easy" and said, "Human beings have different degrees of understanding: those who know and understand in advance, those who know and understand later, and those who do not know or understand at all. For those who know and understand in advance, after studying and understanding clearly, as long as everyone believes in them, obeys them, and follows them to do it earnestly, they can act immediately." It can be seen that no matter what, as long as someone can believe in and obey the guidance of those who know and understand in advance and do it, nothing is impossible to do. President Chiang Kai-shek inherits Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy to guide our party members and the masses in revolution, which is to guide those who know later with those who know in advance and to awaken those who understand later with those who understand in advance. As long as we can believe in and obey President Chiang Kai-shek's leadership, and move forward courageously with an indomitable and decisive spirit, we will surely complete the revolution, reach the broad road, and discover a bright future. This is self-evident. For thousands of years, our people have been dominated by the argument that "knowing is not difficult, acting is difficult," which has made us weak and unmotivated. We only know how to talk without taking action. The path of self-cultivation, family regulation, governance, and peace mentioned by the sages is often regarded as a theory that cannot be put into practice, thus making China, a country with a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population, lag behind in everything. Not only can we not compete with the world's countries, but we are still being ravaged by island barbarians today, which is very painful. The reason for this is that the inability to act is the root cause. Japan stole the remnants of Yangming's philosophy of "extending conscience" and put it into practice. Since the Meiji Restoration, naval officers, army officers, from the Emperor to the soldiers, and educated citizens have all taken the three words "extending conscience" as the philosophical foundation of their national spirit, cultivating a spirit of chivalry, loyalty to the Emperor, and patriotism. Therefore, today they can be strong in the world and even dare to invade China, the source of their national spirit's philosophical foundation. Sun Tzu said, "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you will not be defeated in a hundred battles." Now that we are fighting for justice, we must first study the reasons for the decline of the Chinese nation and the spirit of Japan's founding. Once we understand these, we can know the enemy. But we must also look back at ourselves, find the key, and then act, and then we can win a hundred battles. Premier Sun Yat-sen created the doctrine of "knowing is difficult, acting is easy," and President Chiang Kai-shek used this doctrine to enlighten us. Why don't we quickly follow the purpose, track, and system, and continue to act? Do we want to willingly "sit idle" and wait for death? If everyone can obey President Chiang Kai-shek's leadership and act, it will be as easy as turning one's hand to turn China from weak to strong. Now that the country is in trouble and a strong enemy is rampaging, as long as we are determined to believe that "the final victory will belong to us," and follow President Chiang Kai-shek to act, overcome the environment with perseverance, not be arrogant in victory, not be discouraged in defeat, and continue to "act" one after another, using the truth of "action" to strive for glory, set a firm determination, and act with enthusiasm according to our beliefs, then the war of resistance will surely be won, the country will surely be built, and the future of the party and the country will be limitless. A small island is not worth mentioning. (End)

### Japanese Factory Accountant Embezzles Funds and Wantonly Patronizes Prostitutes, Happily Alternating Between Two Women, Misery Arises from Extreme Joy, Case is Discovered and Arrested, One Prostitute Escapes the Brothel

Zhou Ximin, a native of Suzhou (26 years old), residing at 3428 Hart Road, has been working at the Japanese-owned Naigai Men Spinning Factory Co., Ltd. on West Suzhou Road for many years. Recently, he suddenly changed his behavior and loved women. At around 11 AM on the 5th of this month, the Japanese manager, Asano, entrusted him to

Safeguard the Iron Box

Containing thousands of yuan in legal tender for wage distribution. He secretly embezzled 1,500 yuan and fled, not returning home. First, he went to the roof garden of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road and fell in love with a female tea server, Wang Lanying. Then, he went to her house at 25 Yinyu Lane, Ailege Road, French Concession, and stayed as if they were husband and wife. In two days, he gave Wang four gold rings, a pair of gold bracelets, and items such as cheongsams, leather shoes, and woolen sweaters, spending a huge sum of 263 yuan. Then, on the 7th, he met a 16-year-old private prostitute, Wang Fengyuan, on Zhejiang Road that night.

Love at First Sight

He went with her to the brothel set up by Xu Xinglou (i.e., Qu Xinglou), a native of Pudong, at 431 Tong Road and prostituted himself. He fell in love with the prostitute at first sight. After learning that she was mortgaged to Xu for a price of 200 yuan and had no freedom as a prostitute, he paid the money to redeem Fengyuan and planned to rent a small house to live together as a concubine. From then on, Zhou Ximin took pleasure in alternating between the two women, and opened room 315 at the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road as a place to rest when he was bored every day. He then

Embezzled Funds

From the money, he deposited 700 yuan with the hotel's accounting room for temporary safekeeping to cover all expenses. Unexpectedly, this matter was discovered by a colleague, Xu Fugen, an employee at 14 West Suzhou Road, who informed the Japanese manager Asano yesterday afternoon. Asano reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to the Oriental Hotel and arrested Zhou. They also went to 431 Zhejiang Road and brought Xu Xinglou and the prostitute Wang Fengyuan into the police station and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan

Elaborated on the Case

Accused both defendants of theft and enticing a virtuous woman into prostitution, and stated that a total of 900 yuan in stolen money had been recovered, as well as gold jewelry, clothing, and shoes of the female tea server Wang Lanying. He requested that the prostitute Wang Fengyuan be sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Judge Liu Yugui interrogated the two defendants clearly and ordered them to be detained for sentencing at a later date. Wang was allowed to be sent to the Jiliang Institute for care, and the stolen money was returned to the victim for collection in advance.

### Storing Valuable Wardrobes, Unauthorized Pawn for Expenditure, Gao Zhou Admits Unhesitatingly, Detained for Further Investigation

Zhou Sun Zhuling, a Ningbo woman residing at 44 Mode Village, Fuxu Road, French Concession, recently left Shanghai on business. She stored all her trunks, clothes, wooden furniture, etc. with Gao Zhou, a Sichuan woman living with her. Gao took the radio, ninety-one taels of silver, a fox fur coat, and a fox fur cape, etc., and pawned them in batches at four pawnshops: Huafeng, Shunkang, Jushun, and Hongkang, totaling 419.97 yuan for expenditure. Zhou Sun Zhuling returned to Shanghai some time ago and learned of this. After negotiation, Zhou could not return the items, so she reported to the French Police, who detained Gao Zhou. Yesterday afternoon, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated that the defendant was accused of embezzling deposited items and requested an adjournment for further investigation before questioning again. The plaintiff entrusted lawyer Yu Congdao to act as her agent and filed an incidental civil suit. Questioning the defendant, she unhesitatingly admitted to frequently going to the plaintiff's three suitcases. Judge Wu Kechou approved the postponement for further investigation, and the defendant was detained.

### News of the Municipal Council Concert

The Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold the first symphony concert of the season at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:15 PM on Sunday, October 15th. The program includes eight items. Tickets are priced at 2.6 yuan, 2 yuan, 1.5 yuan, and 1 yuan. Reserved seats, except those that have already been paid for, will be reserved until 5 PM on the same afternoon.

### Husband and Wife Take Poison in the Chunjiang Inn

At 1 PM on the 9th, a Ningbo man, Liang Zhu, 30 years old, and his wife, Liang Zhang, 25 years old, checked into room 10 of the Chunjiang No. 1 Inn, 309 Caishi Street, French Concession. They stayed overnight on the 10th, but unexpectedly, the couple committed suicide together that night. Zhang took poison, while Liang hanged himself on the bed frame. It was not until 1 PM yesterday that the tea server, Xu Xiaodi (36 years old, from Minhang), saw that Liang and his wife had not gotten up and knocked on the door, but there was no response. After prying open the door and entering, he discovered that the couple had committed suicide. Zhang was lying on the bed, barely breathing, while Liang's body was still warm. He immediately took him down and reported to the French Police, who sent detectives to investigate. A suicide note was left behind, and they were sent to Guangci Hospital for rescue. Zhang died two hours after being admitted to the hospital due to severe poisoning. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. The Special Court will be requested to send personnel to examine the body today. The reason for the suicide is said to be economic reasons.

### Large Parcels to America Must Be Posted One Week in Advance

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1579: Due to the current situation, the number of ship voyages has been reduced, and all parcels sent to America are extremely crowded, making it difficult to load and export them. If merchants have large parcels to be sent to America, they must post them one week before the bureau's sealing date, or first submit a letter to the bureau's parcel receiving group for registration, so that the space on the ship can be reserved for loading on schedule. This notice is hereby issued for general knowledge.

### French Police Department Strictly Arrests Hooligans, Dozens Arrested in Recent Days

The French Concession Police Department, in view of the rampant hooliganism in the concession, which endangered public security, sent detectives to investigate. It was confirmed that hooligans were wreaking havoc everywhere. For example, when a resident's baby died, they demanded a fixed price of five yuan. When a shop opened, they even led a crowd to extort several to dozens of yuan. Other wedding and funeral celebrations and posted notices were immediately exploited by hooligan leaders from various sections to extort protection money, which was deeply hated by the citizens. Therefore, the police department specially formed a group responsible for cleaning up. After several days of major arrests, it is heard that dozens of people have been arrested, and the hooligans have disappeared in recent days and dare not cause trouble.

### Hollywood Gambling Den in Decline

The News Agency reports that since the "Avenue Police" have been patrolling the areas along the roads built outside the Western Shanghai Concession, there are few people on the road at night. The Hollywood gambling den on Yu Road, which is known as one of the top gold-selling dens in Shanghai, has been greatly affected, and the number of gamblers at night has decreased, causing business to plummet. Recently, it has been in a state of collapse. It is heard that the den was suddenly robbed by bandits some time ago, resulting in heavy losses. Therefore, the internal situation has been even more in decline in recent days.

### Coolie Unaware of Dangerous Situation, Loses Life in Vain, Shot to Death by Japanese Army While Crossing River

Regarding the incident at 6:30 AM yesterday when a Chinese man was shot and killed by Japanese soldiers in the Chinese area of Nanhuajie, Dapu Bridge, French Concession, it is now learned that the Chinese man was a coolie, but his name is unknown. At the time, the coolie was crossing the Xujiahui River, intending to take this shortcut to enter the Chinese area, which led to him being shot by the sentry on the Chinese area riverbank. (Another news) Xu Guixing, a farmer residing at Maojiazhai, Nan Fenglinqiao, 32 years old, went out on business at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday (National Day). When Xu walked to near Damuqiao Road, Xietu Road, he suddenly encountered a Japanese soldier patrolling and asked Xu Guixing to show his citizen's card. Because Xu forgot to bring it for a moment, he panicked and fled. The Japanese soldier became suspicious and opened fire to pursue him. Xu was shot several times and fell to the ground, dead.

### Flying Thief Captured Again, Claims to Have Reformed and Changed His Ways, Ordered to be Detained for Further Investigation and Verification

Wang Zhaorong, a well-known flying thief from Huzhou, 28 years old, specializes in stealing valuables from the residences of foreign merchants in the British and French Concessions. He is able to climb over walls and eaves, hence the name "flying thief." He was previously arrested and sent to court, where he was sentenced to a heavy sentence. He had been missing for a long time. Recently, the residences of foreign merchants in the Western District of the French Concession have been reporting the theft of large amounts of valuables. The French Police Department ordered detectives to investigate and arrest him. It was recently learned by Detective Chief Xin that Wang was hiding in room 11 of the Hai Dongchun Inn in Yude Lane, Yunnan Road, British Concession. They then joined forces with the Public Police Department and sent detectives to arrest Wang and brought him back to the French Police Department. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court and interrogated by Judge Zhang Minsheng. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang stated that the defendant's theft case was not yet fully investigated and requested a postponement for further questioning. Wang confessed that he had committed theft before, but had now reformed and changed his ways and was making a living by performing opera. The court verified his confession and ordered him to be detained for further investigation and verification at a later date.

### Tiantong Theatre, Conflict During the New Year Procession, One Person Injured and Sent to the Hospital

At 9:45 PM last night, a conflict suddenly broke out between spectators at the Tiantong Theatre, 701 Tiantong Road, which was performing Shaoxing opera, and they started fighting. The number of people who joined the fight reached more than fifty or sixty. For a time, chairs and tables were raised high, and teapots and cups flew. As a result, one person was seriously injured and fell to the ground. The theatre reported the incident to the police station, and by the time the police officers arrived, the crowd had scattered. The injured person was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Correspondence

To whom it may concern: We, Weng Guangxin, Weng Guangyong, Weng Cai-shi, and Weng Guiying, the owners of the Jiatai Clothing Store, hereby state that our younger brothers, Guangzheng and Guangzhe, colluded with our father's concubine and took advantage of the situation to embezzle a large sum of money from the store over the years. Therefore, after a family meeting, they were relieved of their duties as assistant managers, and Guangxin was appointed as the manager. All co-owners jointly took over the management to thoroughly investigate the fraudulent accounts to rectify the situation and protect the joint property. On September 28th, when Guangxin and others took over the store affairs according to law and ordered the handover of account books, Guangzheng instigated store employees to forcibly open the account box, intending to steal the account books. Guangxin and others stopped them, but to no avail. Therefore, they took the store employees and the account box to the police station to file a complaint. Unexpectedly, Guangzheng instead instigated the store employees to falsely accuse Guangxin and others of robbing the account box. After investigation, the police station found the accusations to be false and that the matter involved a domestic dispute between brothers. They released them and refused to accept the case. There is a record of this. However, Guangzheng, instigated by others, did not hesitate to turn against his own family. On the 4th of this month, while Guangxin and others were working in the store, he falsely reported to the police station, falsely accusing them of obstructing his freedom. Although the police station summoned Guangxin and others to the court, the court did not prosecute them because the matter involved a civil family dispute. Now, five days have passed, and yesterday we saw a section in the *Shen Bao*'s local news titled "Brothers Sued for Disputing Clothing Store Manager Position." Many of the facts are inaccurate. The report stated that they "swarmed into the store, disregarding the situation, forcibly took over the store, and drove Weng Guangzheng out of the store." However, Guangxin and others have always been working in their own store, so there was no such thing as swarming into the store. On the 4th of this month, when Guangzheng falsely reported to the police station, Guangxin and others never quarreled with him before or after the incident. The landlords of the second house and the neighbors all witnessed this. How could there be such a thing as driving him out of the store? Moreover, in the police station and the court, he himself never made such a statement. This is evidenced by the written records. The report also stated that "French police officers rushed to No. 26, Taihe Lane, Baier Road, and arrested Weng Guangxin and the other three people." This is even more untrue. According to the facts, Guangxin and the other three people were summoned while they were in their own store. There was no such thing as reported in the news. This news is clearly inaccurate. To avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, we kindly request that you write to the newspaper to request a correction to reveal the truth. We are writing on their behalf and hope that your newspaper will publish this letter in the "Correspondence" section to make a correction. We pray for this. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Chief Editor of *Shen Bao*, Lawyer Shao Shengzu, October 9th.

### The Destruction of Sennacherib

— By Byron, translated by Pinpin

The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.

For Death breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
And his breath withered eyes.
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!

And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride:
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
And cold as the spray of the rock-beaten surf.

And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.

And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!

(Original title: The Destruction of Sennacherib)

### Japan Today in the Age of Substitutes (Part 1)

— Written by Midorikawa Eiko, translated by Wang Sanjie

A rickshaw puller who hasn't eaten enough…

Dazzling wooden clogs

"Let's call a car home right away!"

That's what I thought in my heart after the train arrived in Tokyo, so I got off the train immediately and rushed outside the station. Because I hadn't seen my parents for two years!

But strangely! The cars that used to crowd in front of the station are now nowhere to be seen, replaced only by some dirty rickshaws.

Helplessly, I had to take a rickshaw. But I don't know if it was because I was so eager to see my parents, or because the rickshaw puller was sick or hadn't eaten enough? It made me feel that the rickshaw was moving so slowly through the streets and alleys, inching forward step by step.

Oh, so many wooden clogs!

"I'm almost dizzy. I never thought that even those gentlemen in gorgeous Western clothes would wear wooden clogs, kicking and stomping on the sidewalks. I remember that about fifty years ago, a certain Mr. Lefcadio Hearn (i.e., Koizumi Yakumo), a Japanophile, praised the noise of wooden clogs as 'Japanese mysticism.' Is the government now trying to exhibit this 'national essence' to the world? But everyone knows that wartime Japan doesn't have enough leather to make leather shoes, and even Mr. Hearn, if he were still alive, would frown and shake his head in dissatisfaction at this 'anachronism'!"

…Mr. Ikeda Shōhin… the leader… of wartime material control… wants to buy a carriage and a coachman…

I heard a radio station broadcasting this intermittently when I changed trains in Shinjuku.

The "New Morality" of Aggressors

A daughter coming home after two years should make her mother laugh with joy. However, my return home didn't make my mother happy, but instead made her cry, because she was thinking of her son on the battlefield in China.

In the evening, she muttered everything in front of her daughter; cursing the constant rise in prices, the increasing layers of taxes... and even complaining that the hospital gave her ineffective medicine... Now they can only eat whale meat instead of pork and beef... She said that the two gold teeth she originally had were also taken out and replaced with a kind of "synthetic gold" with a strange name. And according to her, she felt that everything tasted bland ever since...

——Ah! "S.F.", that bad thing! She exclaimed suddenly as if she had just thought of it. Then she angrily told me. (Originally, "S.F." is an abbreviation for a kind of substitute cotton cloth). She said: That bad thing, it's uncomfortable to wear, it's not durable, but it's very expensive! Of course, she said: the ladies of those "Patriotic Women's Association" and "National Defense Women's Association" can wear those pure white aprons made of it to show off! But what about some women who have to work all day? Sigh, I have to buy at least two aprons for my mother every month! Think, aprons are like this, clothes, what about them? What about everything else to wear? What a huge expense! Do the Chinese also use this annoying "S.F." or even worse things?

——No, I immediately replied to her: The Chinese do not lack cotton cloth!

——China is a country that "has" things! Father suddenly interjected: And Japan is a country that "lacks" things. That's why this war started.

I was about to refute this excuse of fascist aggressors, but mother opened her mouth:

——A few days ago, I went to Ito for a trip, and I don't know what kind of hot spring this is? But it's so strange, the towel made of S.F. that I used only for the first time, dissolved in the bath, and, ah...

Seemingly like a virgin, suddenly mother blushed and couldn't continue. (Japan has a custom of mixed bathing for men and women, using only a towel to cover the lower body, whether at home or in public bathhouses.)

——It doesn't matter, Mom! This is the "new morality" of Japanese aggressors! I said, stabbing out like a sharp knife.

——Bastard! Father suddenly got angry: You... you, even your soul has been assimilated by the Chinese...

The Mailbox is Crying

Iron! Iron!! Iron!!!

The whole of Japan is boiling over with the demand for iron.

One day, my brother sent us a letter from the front line in Central China. The letter contained only a few sentences in between:

——...Recently, I don't know why, the letters from Japan are always so damp that even the words are not very clear. Is our military postal service now so bad?

Dear brother, I wrote back to tell him: In your motherland, people now have nothing to give you who are fighting abroad except tears. Now, everything is surprisingly expensive! But tears are becoming less and less valuable. Day after day, desperately looking to the west, mothers cry, wives cry, children cry, and even the newly emerged female postmen cry for their husbands who will never return, and even the iron mailboxes cry... Ah, that's right! Brother, you still don't know, do you? There are 100,000 mailboxes in the whole of Japan, 20,000 of which are made of iron, and a month ago someone removed the 20,000 iron ones and replaced them with non-metallic ones. So as soon as it rains, they cry immediately - and the letters inside get wet. Dear brother! You must know: in Japan, 20,000 mailboxes are crying, and in China, those old iron 20,000, have already become bombs and made countless innocent neighbors cry!...

### Sea Love

— Lin Hao

The mighty and majestic spirit, like a reckless wild bull, using its horns to charge fiercely at the heel of the cliffs, without rest or tranquility; this irritability and ambition has always been a trace that I have found difficult to forget since my childhood.

I love even more the summit of the shady ridge near the sea, blowing in the wind, looking far into the vast expanse of white silk, rolling its huge and incomparably large body, slowly and quickly opening its mouth, rolling its wings, tossing over, as if swallowing me in one gulp; I immediately feel a long and comfortable breath of fresh air coming out of my heart; everything becomes pleasant and refreshing, no matter how great your melancholy mistakes or memories are, they will all turn into nothing!

Because I love the sea, my mother repeatedly taught me:

"Child! Go to the sea less, the sea is a terrible monster!"

I am stubborn. I didn't remember my mother's words; I still lingered by the sea.

At night, I followed the darkness and quietly went out of the house. Starlight pointed to the fields, and from time to time I would trample on a few small puddles full of water, making a TATA sound, I ignored everything. For the sake of the sea, I am willing to endure grievances. Listening to the old frogs croaking, walking the familiar road. I hoped, and began to lie down on the beach, watching the cloud shadows dyed by the seawater.

Three or two black dots, flapping heavy wings, flying by the sea, shimmering with silver light reflected by the moonlight, that is the chase of bats and gray birds.

The world is quiet, but the sea is not quiet, the shouts of the Volga boatmen; majestic, tidy, rhythmically chanting for the people in dreams to enjoy. But they are all dead, they cannot hear the song of the sea at night; only I am fortunate enough to boast of myself.

If the night wind hadn't woken me up, (it was cold) I wouldn't have been so reluctant to leave this great sea.

Just like that, I often warmed my bed only when the watchman was striking three o'clock.

Facing the morning breeze, watching the free seagulls chasing the water fish, listening to the sound of the oars struggling out of the fishing boat; that is also a beautiful pencil sketch of the sea.

However, later, gradually, the whip of life shook behind my back, and I began to leave the paradise of my childhood. The environment, in turn, forged me into a city parasite.

It has been three years since I went to my childhood hometown, nor have I been to the Wusongkou that can be regarded as a memory; although I was in there, I was熏陶成像 a selfish, mean, and sordid hero by the high houses, the coal smoke of the big fire wheels, and its narrowness; but that could at least warm my lost old dreams!

What about now? I often dream of that mysterious and majestic sea.

Sea, I miss you! I want to swoop above you like a petrel, unafraid of the mourning of the diving birds, and regardless of the timidity of the penguins; come, you bring lightning and storms, I will bravely make a huge return.

### On Short Works

— Chi Qiang

Recently, various newspaper supplements generally welcome short works. This is a common requirement of editors, and readers are even praying silently.

Short drafts are like short weapons, and short weapons may be the best weapons for hand-to-hand combat or street fighting. Long and lengthy writings, like a long snake array, sometimes inevitably suffer from "tail too big to wag."

If art is really to be worthy of being called "paper bullets," then these "paper bullets" should also be economical now, and these "paper bullets" should also be cherished. Although cherishing is not like the "Tongshanshe" so enthusiastically "cherishing written paper" for the seeds of reading to "call to heaven," in order to exert its effectiveness, it is better to be short than redundant, it is better to be precise than crude, it is better to be powerful than tired and numb, then shortness as shortness must also take on its responsibilities.

Someone once looked at a twenty-story skyscraper and felt dizzy, knowing how hard it is to stretch the neck, and it seems to be an exaggeration of life and a luxury of mankind; this may be an extreme statement. But in addition to dealing with myriad affairs every day (both physically and mentally), living in a streamlined life, this originally needs to be tasted with sufficient leisure. Therefore, encountering two small structures - such as a "Spanish-style" courtyard - will feel a sense of freshness.

The reason why short works are loved is probably this. We cannot throw away a stone and anchor the giant wheel of the times by our side; and we cannot excessively lengthen our lives, and we cannot but capture a little of the diverse shadow of the times, but we need a batch of short and meaningful things to entrust our hearts and entrust our bodies.

Human psychology is also very strange. New droplets stir up new ripples, and then fill a few satisfying waves; chasing ripples and searching for seven droplets from those waves, we feel even more fresh. But look at these fresh things, continuing, continuing, strung together one after another, like candle oil, the old ones as stepping stones, the tender ones flowing in those gaps.

Here, I hope for short, fine pieces to fill the gaps on the road of life!

Traveling in the World of Film History

### The Origin of the Name Hollywood

— Pei Fei

Hollywood, the film city, the "Kingdom of Cinema" that tens of millions of people around the world are watching, the origin of its name is probably unknown to the general public, but they are happy to know. Here, let me tell you all about it.

If we divide the Hollywood area into east, south, west, and north, then its center is Cahuenga Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. Cahuenga Avenue was originally a mountain road more than two hundred years ago. Going north from here for six miles, you can reach the city of Honiba Xiu and the Southant Plains of Self. This place is usually called "Cahuenga Pass", which was once a small mountain path passed by the Spanish expeditionary force of monks.

In 1770, when the old monk Qiu Pibiro. Sarah passed this path, because he was tired from walking, he temporarily rested in the shade of a tree, and accidentally swept his eyes to the distance, saw the oak tree growing there, could not help but exclaim in amazement, praising: "Holy Forest of the Cross" (Holly Wood of Cross)! As a result, people mistakenly thought that the origin of the name Hollywood came from here. ——Actually, it is wrong.

At that time, Hollywood was an uninhabited area. In 1855, the first house was built; "Hollywood Village", that name was only in 1887 later.

When Meijishi Kotto broke away from Spain, and the people of the whole country were happy, a young youth was living on a farm in Michigan, and this person was later the famous Holland. Uynnill Kokoqi. In 1880, after the death of his ex-wife, he married a girl named Tengda. Hattanal, soon after, he rode an Arabian horse across the continent and stopped at the Ross & Angiles area. In 1900, the product of the two of them died unfortunately, and in order to forget their sorrow, they moved to Hollywood, bought a farm of one hundred and sixty acres, and they planted a kind of tree called Holly on this farmland.

Hollywood, correctly speaking, comes from the word Holly. ——It refers to these holly trees, because holly trees are generally regarded as the cleanest things in the West.

In 1898, the first post office was established. Later, due to the rapid increase in population and the convenience of transportation, it was officially named a city by the government in 1903, and the first mayor elected was Sunfuwater. Riki.

In 1911, the first motion picture studio was built in Hollywood. After that, Hollywood became the center of the world's film industry, no, a kingdom of cinema.

### Actress Song Dechuan Talks About: Practicing Stilt Skills and Fighting (Part 2)

— Recorded by Leng Fang

Anecdotes of an Entertainer

Three Years of Hard Work

Stilt skills and fighting are the basic skills of martial arts actresses, and the learning process is equally difficult without hard work. In the past, when I entered school at the age of fourteen, I first started practicing stilt skills: two wooden stilts were tied to my legs, and my feet were placed on them, only allowing force, and I had to practice for one or two hours every day. The first step: like a child learning to walk, groping against the wall, walking with a cane, after a few months, the gait was quite stable. The second step: standing dullly upright on a narrow stool, starting from one or two minutes, gradually increasing to be able to stand firmly for one hour, and it took nearly a year. The third step: standing on bricks, standing two tiles upright and dividing them on the ground, also starting from a few minutes, and after a year of work, slowly standing for one hour. The fourth step, running on a broomstick, tightly clamping a broomstick between the legs, moving slowly step by step, gradually changing from slow to fast, walking with fine steps inch by inch, after half a year. —This is used for running around the arena, and clamping the broomstick is a learning method that restricts walking wide steps. The basic skills of stilt work are considered complete only when walking and stopping are stable. In this way, working day and night under strict discipline, counting the time will be nearly three years, and for this reason, all the strength is in the toes, and very tight thick skin grows on it: now I usually like to wear shoes with higher heels, which is also a habit formed by practicing stilt work.

New Inventions

After learning stilt skills well, you must practice Baizi, somersaults, and general waist and leg skills to achieve considerable success, and then you can start fighting. The learning process of this skill is from simple to complex, focusing on speed. The teacher's instruction only pointed out one method, which should be practiced hard by oneself, and after a long time, you will be able to handle it with ease, and skillfully play out various ever-changing patterns. Therefore, this point can only be understood, and it is difficult to say how to learn it. I remember the teachers often said: "Art begins with method and ends with no method. If you can build a solid foundation, you will be able to exert it as you wish." These words are quite correct. Although my various fighting martial arts skills are not fully impressive, most of them come from arbitrary creation. As a result of the dedicated research in the past year, a total of eight sets of new fighting methods have been obtained, each set has twenty or thirty kinds, some simple and some complex, and no names have been decided yet. The only one that feels slightly satisfactory is one person dealing with three people, and playing the equal spears (usually only three spears) into a continuous ring, constantly floating in the air.

Greatest Wish

My greatest wish is to definitely go to Europe and America. At first, Qiao Ping, after seeing my fighting performance, praised me a lot and strongly urged me to go abroad to perform. Mr. Li Boyan of the drama school is a diplomat in Europe and also holds this view. Therefore, my wish is very firm, and sooner or later I will have to make this long journey. I know very well that my skills are still shallow, and I am even more unwilling to underestimate myself. Now I am only working hard, not interfering with other things, and I firmly believe that taking advantage of my youth and strength is an important period for me to strive for progress.

To all contributors: I am very grateful for your great works in September. The royalties have now been settled. Please prepare a sealed stamp and collect them from the accounting office of this library from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 16th to 19th of this month.

### The Dictator Declared Stranded

— De Gang

The long-rumored Chaplin's talkie "The Dictator," which had been in production for more than half a year, has recently been suspended. The reason is that with the outbreak of the European war, the U.S. government feared causing various political disputes, so it advised Chaplin to stop filming. Chaplin himself also knew that the European war would greatly affect the film's sales, so he also agreed to postpone filming. However, according to him, once the war ends, he will continue the project and ensure its complete success, so as not to disappoint the audience's high expectations.

Since the news of the suspension spread, movie fans around the world have been greatly disappointed. To console the audience, Chaplin decided to film another light-hearted comedy. The theme has not yet been announced. Those who love Chaplin's works can rest assured, at least for now.

### Anecdotes from the Peking Opera World

— Xu Yiyun

The Filial Piety and Righteousness of the Three Lius

It was often said in the past that "actors have no righteousness," and that these people perform all the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness on stage, so they are disloyal, unfilial, unkind, and unrighteous in private. However, this statement cannot be generalized. There are bad ones, of course, but there are also many good people. I will now present three people who can serve as good role models for today's male and female actors. I hope that all the actors of today will pay attention. What is most strange is that these three all happen to be surnamed Liu, which is very different from the line in "A Monk's Revenge" where Liu Jin scolds the matchmaker Liu: "How can good people live together with such wretches?" It is evident that these three Lius are definitely not from the matchmaker Liu's family.

"Filial Piety and Righteousness" is originally the name of a play, which tells the story of Sun Shangxiang hearing the news of Liu Bei's death and throwing herself into the river, and then entering the palace to entrust a dream to Wu Guotai. However, what is described in this article is not the issue of the play. The so-called "Filial Piety and Righteousness of the Three Lius" refers to the filial piety of Liu Kuiguan, a famous painted-face actor, the righteousness of Liu Gansan, a famous clown actor, and the chastity of Liu Xikui, a famous female impersonator.

Kuiguan was from Licheng, Shandong. He studied under famous teachers such as Ge Wenyu, Fan Baoting, Li Zhonghua, and Wang Fulian, so he was able to perform all kinds of plays, including martial male roles, martial painted-face roles, male painted-face roles, and red-faced roles. In his prime, he performed for a long time in major cities of Henan Province and Xubeng area, and his reputation was excellent. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he came to Shanghai and joined the Danggui First Stage, becoming famous immediately. Later, he performed at the Tianchan and other stages for a long time, so many people in Shanghai knew his name. Several years ago, a close friend of his, who was already a commander in Sichuan, invited Liu to Sichuan to form a troupe, so he left and never returned. It is said that his recent situation is quite good, and he gets along very well with people from all walks of life in Sichuan's military and political circles, and many people respect him for his character. The biggest reason is that the story of Liu cutting his flesh to treat his parents has long been well known, and in addition, this act actually came from someone in the acting world in recent times, so it is generally considered to be an unparalleled act of filial piety. Also, Liu is a member of the Hongmen Society, and he usually attaches great importance to the concept of righteousness. There are many fellow members in Sichuan, and the fact that he has been able to maintain his position there for a long time is not unrelated to this. (117) Chess Garden
