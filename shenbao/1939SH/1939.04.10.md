### American Nationals in Chongqing and Chengdu Oppose New Neutrality Law

(Chengdu) American nationals here recently jointly telegraphed President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, expressing their opposition to the new Neutrality Law. The original telegram stated that the New Neutrality Law treats the aggressor country Japan and the invaded country China the same. All American nationals in Chengdu firmly oppose it.

(Chongqing) Fei Xiu, secretary of the National Association of Chinese Christian Youth Association, recently telegraphed President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Lonergan, expressing his opposition to the provisions of the New Neutrality Law. The original telegram stated, "The Pittman Neutrality Law is beneficial to Japan and harmful to China. American nationals in Chongqing were shocked and bewildered upon learning of it. Sino-American friendship has been greatly hindered as a result. Free China has made tremendous progress economically and industrially. If the United States can reverse its past actions and not supply the enemy of China with various necessary military supplies, and not further aid the enemy of China morally and financially, then China's future is indeed infinitely bright. However, the United States has hitherto ignored its moral and treaty rights and has failed to enact legislation sufficient to increase China's resistance. We deeply regret it. We believe that all goods that can be used in wartime should be prohibited from being transported to aggressor countries. At the same time, the United States should increase its assistance to China."

### Central Hubei War Situation; Favorable Situation Has Unfolded; River-Crossing Troops Occupy Yuxin River; Yangzi Town Recaptured on the Hanyi Road

Yichang: A reporter arrived at the Shayang front line for inspection on the 8th. While riding a horse, artillery battles were raging on both sides of the river. The sound of shells passing slowly could be heard constantly. Along the way, the people were farming freely. Although the sound of guns and artillery filled the sky, the people were still conducting small businesses near the trenches. This calmness and their spirit of helping the army in the war of resistance are deeply admirable. The morale on the front line is also very high. Then I went to the Han River bank to look at the first line, and I could remotely see the Japanese camp at Luohan Temple on the east bank. In the midst of the dense gunfire of the Chinese, a Japanese soldier was shot and fell to the ground, and there was a general appearance of panic and disorder. Along the river, the Chinese fortifications are extremely solid. Since the Chinese launched a full-scale counteroffensive in recent days, crossing the river to attack everywhere, the Japanese are overwhelmed and feel extremely threatened. On the evening of the 8th, after the Chinese army crossed the river from more than a dozen places, the Japanese army in Duobaowan, Chaojiakou, and other places suffered extremely heavy casualties. A part of Zhangjiegang has been recaptured by the Chinese army. One route of the Chinese army advanced to the vicinity of Yonglong River, and another route occupied the Yuxin River south of Wamiaoji. North of the Hanyi Highway, Yangzi Town was recaptured. Zhongxiang is under siege by the Chinese army. The favorable situation in the war in central Hubei has unfolded here. (9th Telegraph)

Editorial

### The Anti-Aggression Bloc and China

Will China join the anti-aggression bloc?

This question involves many aspects, and none of those aspects have so far expressed themselves. Fundamentally, this is because the organization of the anti-aggression bloc is only just beginning and lacks a clear outline. As an American figure, according to a Reuters report yesterday, felt, "Efforts are still needed to complete the work of this organization", meaning there is still a distance to go before completion. Because of this, although the question is complex and far-reaching, it is still too early to demand a definite answer from the relevant parties. According to a London dispatch, the British House of Commons will reconvene on the 19th of this month, at which time Labour MP Mr. Henderson will question Prime Minister Chamberlain about whether the government intends to invite China to join the anti-aggression bloc. That time is still ten days away. Given the ever-changing international situation, which can change in an instant, even a short period of ten days can feel like a long night with many dreams. Whether Mr. Henderson will ask this question at that time, or how he will ask it, cannot be foreseen today. And whether that time will have already become the time for demanding a definite answer from the British government is difficult to say.

After lamenting the failure of Mr. Chamberlain's appeasement policy, we were full of hope that the organization of the anti-aggression bloc would be completed satisfactorily. As the facts show, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck returned from his visit to England, and a historical creation was formed between England and Poland, enabling the anti-aggression bloc to realize its first ring. Much effort was expended, and the result cannot be called nothing. However, it is still far from the ideal bloc. At this very moment, Italy is using force against Albania, capturing it in one fell swoop, as easily as taking something out of a pocket. The Mediterranean situation has undergone a dramatic change. The key to the Adriatic Sea has now fallen into their hands. Aggressor countries have achieved their goals, while small and weak countries have suffered the tragedy of living or dying at their whim. Yugoslavia is in a panic, and Greece is trembling. In short, their aggressive arrogance is like the prelude to conquering everything. This is getting closer and closer to the stage of hegemony. The comfort that the Anglo-Polish achievement has given to anti-aggressors has been erased by the Italian aggression. As diplomacy bends and violence diverts, will those who decide the fate of international control be the first to complete the organization of the anti-aggression bloc, or will aggressive actions first achieve their goals through piecemeal attacks? Apart from a deep self-confidence based on justice, optimism should not be lightly indulged.

We firmly believe that justice will ultimately prevail, and we have no doubt that the organization of the anti-aggression bloc will ultimately be realized. If the bloc is a European bloc, it has nothing to do with China, and there is fundamentally no need to question whether China should join. However, we are not convinced that the lessons of aggression and violence in recent years are not enough to awaken the delusions of complacency and isolation, and local security. In other words, any act of aggression that spreads to any corner outside of Europe cannot possibly fail to affect Europe, and Europe cannot possibly maintain its safety and equilibrium. This is an impossibility. The reason why European powers are powers, although originating in Europe, is that their strength and life are sustained outside of Europe. Therefore, in its meaning, interests, and practical effect, the organization of the anti-aggression bloc must have aggression and anti-aggression as two opposing entities, and it cannot be divided by continent. To emphasize continental boundaries would only reward aggression outside the boundaries, and would also encourage aggression of a larger scale and scope. The advance of aggression outside the boundaries would only allow the aggressive arrogance inside the boundaries to be echoed and become increasingly rampant, and would only make the anti-aggression measures inside the boundaries more constrained and difficult. China's Hainan Island, irrelevant to current military strategy, cannot escape disaster. The new Nansha Islands between Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines, long known as pending cases, have suddenly changed hands. It is precisely that the advanced contacts in aggression and anti-aggression occurred outside of Europe, having direct and indirect relations with the various countries of Europe.

European anti-aggression politicians are not unaware of this. It is just that China is currently being invaded and is already engaged in a war of anti-aggression. At present, anti-aggression politicians, with their unawakened dreams of preventing aggression through peace, are probably unwilling to hastily promote anti-aggression outside of Europe and fall into the vortex themselves. Therefore, it is a natural conclusion that those organizing the anti-aggression bloc do not want to invite China to join in the early stages. In China, we are not only full of hope for the completion of the anti-aggression bloc in Europe or any region, but we must also regard ourselves as strong members of the anti-aggression front. If the scope of the anti-aggression bloc exceeds Europe, then China's willingness to participate is undoubtedly beyond question. However, the anti-aggression organization on the other side has only just begun, and even among those anti-aggression politicians, there is no evidence of frankness and sincere cooperation. Therefore, as for what its future holds, we can only observe its development with enthusiasm and quietness. Here, we have been fighting for anti-aggression for 21 months, and the conditions for winning victory are becoming increasingly abundant, and the time for final victory is getting closer and closer. Therefore, apart from focusing on continuing the war of resistance, we naturally have no expectations for the completion of the anti-aggression bloc. Moreover, although Europe and the Far East, and even the entire world, each have their own historical and geographical systems, the political and economic realities are intertwined and inseparable. Therefore, today, as China's war of resistance enters its second phase and Europe's anti-aggression movement is still in its first phase, each has its own tasks and its own urgency. However, the final control of the international situation must treat Europe, the Far East, and the entire world as one complete question. If countries still act independently, each pursuing its own interests, even if a situation of temporary peace is achieved through individual solutions, the international situation is still a unified problem. Therefore, the efforts of all countries must be gathered on the same foundation to seek a comprehensive solution. Clearly making aggression and anti-aggression in all parts of the world as opposing entities is the beginning of a comprehensive solution.

### Japanese Planes Madly Bomb Yushan; More than 60 Bombs Dropped in the City and Suburbs; More than 200 Civilians Killed and Wounded, 300 Houses Destroyed

Yushan: Nine Japanese planes, which took off from Hangzhou on the 9th, passed through Fuyang, Jinhua, and Qu County, and sneaked into Yushan at 9:43 a.m. to wreak havoc, dropping more than 60 bombs in the city and suburbs, killing and wounding more than 200 civilians, and destroying more than 300 houses. The losses were heavy. (9th Telegraph)

Wuzhou: Eight Japanese planes reconnoitered along Beihai on the morning of the 9th. At 10:04 a.m., they dropped eight bombs in Hepu and strafed with machine guns. At 10:32 a.m., a second batch of eight Japanese planes flew to Hepu again to drop bombs. The Chinese Air Force received the news and formed a formation in the clouds to surround them. The Japanese planes were caught off guard and fought back in a panic and fled wounded. (9th Telegraph)

(Kunming) At about 12:00 noon on the 9th, it was reported that eight Japanese planes had sneaked into the Yunnan border from Guizhou.

### In Order to Protect Their Interests in China, the Powers Must Cooperate to Restrain Japan

(Chongqing) The Chinese Army's newspaper, "Saodang Bao," stated in an article today that the issues discussed by the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the British Ambassador to China, Kerr, in Shanghai, focused on maintaining Britain's political, economic, and military position in the Far East. This is the natural result of Japan's implementation of its policy of closing the door of China and eliminating the interests of third countries. According to the newspaper's editorial, if foreigners want to maintain the interests of third-country nationals in China: (1) Britain and France must implement the various resolutions of the League of Nations to aid China; (2) Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and other countries must convene a Pacific Land Defense Conference to discuss business preferences and military cooperation methods, and the United States must also be invited to participate in the conference; (3) Britain and France must take economic retaliation measures against Japan; (4) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must establish close cooperation in the Far East.

### Recent Sudden Increase in Activity: Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Severed, Siege of Yixing Imminent

Ningguo: The Jiangnan Guerrilla Force has recently become unexpectedly active, completely severing traffic on the northern section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, as well as the Wujin-Jintan Highway. The Japanese army in Nanjing is shaken. The battle achievements are recorded as follows: (1) On the 7th, in the afternoon, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, destroying two kilometers of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway between Lingkou and Lücheng (between Zhenjiang and Wujin). At the same time, 300 meters of the railway east of Lücheng was also dismantled, killing more than twenty Japanese soldiers. (2) The highway from Yiqiao to Huangtang (between Wujin and Jintan) was heavily attacked by Chinese guerrillas and armed civilians on the 6th and 7th, destroying more than one hundred sections of the road surface and completely destroying all the bridges. (3) On the 7th, the Chinese army launched a night attack on the Japanese army in Xinqiao (southeast of Lishui), fighting fiercely until dawn. The Japanese army was forced to retreat along the highway. In this battle, the Chinese army captured two artillery pieces (with the inscription "Made in Showa 12") and some other military supplies. The Chinese army is continuing to advance. (9th dispatch)

Ningguo: On the morning of the 7th, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a three-pronged attack on Yixing, making rapid progress. One route captured the Catholic Church (inside Yixing city), another captured Yingchu Bridge (northeast of Yixing), and the third advanced to a certain location in the southeastern suburbs of Yixing. The encirclement of Yixing has been completed, and it can be taken in a day or two. (9th dispatch)

### Results of Japanese Control of Industry: Cotton Industry in Chaos, Cotton Exports Decreasing Daily, Tsuda Urges Government Relief

(Tokyo) Shingo Tsuda, president of the Kanegafuchi Cotton Spinning Company of Japan, recently urged the Japanese government to review the "short-sighted" measures of its industrial control. According to Tsuda, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese cotton industry has fallen into chaos due to the government's various financial controls, such as restrictions on domestic cotton consumption, the linking system for import and export industries, the cotton money allocation system, and restrictions on cotton shipments to the three northeastern provinces and the North China Yen Bloc. Domestic cotton mills have also suffered losses due to a shortage of labor. Although these situations are temporary phenomena during wartime and are inevitable, the control measures have not been effectively implemented. For example, under the linking system, only one type of Japanese raw-colored cloth is exported in large quantities, and unscrupulous foreign merchants take advantage of the regulation that forces exports within a specified period to drive down the price of Japanese cotton cloth. As a result, cotton exports declined in value last year. In 1938, Japanese cotton textile exports totaled 2,180,000,000 square yards, worth 404,000,000 yen, compared to 2,640,000,000 square yards worth 573,000,000 yen in 1937, a decrease of 464,000,000 square yards worth 169,000,000 yen. The most important reasons for this are as follows: (1) Restrictions on raw cotton imports have led to a shortage of cotton; (2) Overseas Chinese boycotts of Japanese goods; (3) The exclusion of Japanese goods from the British economic bloc; (4) The recent development of the cotton industry in British India; and (5) The decline in purchasing power of major producing countries in the world.

### Italian Propaganda: Complete Occupation of Albania, Mimicking Puppet Welcome News, Also Stealing the Name of Self-Defense to Cover Up Aggression

Albanian Capital: After the Italian army occupied this place, another three thousand well-equipped special forces were transported by giant three-engine aircraft and arrived last night. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived earlier to negotiate the formation of a puppet government. After landing at the airport, the special forces set up machine guns. Terrified Albanian women and children all witnessed this group descending from the sky. They also took out slogans exposing the various crimes of Albanian King Zog and posters praising Mussolini's merits from the plane and posted them in various thoroughfares, intending to never allow Zog to be restored to power. It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will also arrive by plane today to make a triumphant entry into the city. It is also reported that Hitler intends to present the crown of the former Albanian famous general Skanderbeg, now in the Vienna Museum, to Italian King Emmanuel III. Italian Commander-in-Chief of the Albanian Conquest, General Cussoni, arrived here by plane from Durazzo this afternoon and immediately established his headquarters here. According to his public announcement, Elbasan, the last city in Albania to resist the Italian army, has also been officially occupied, and Shkodër was occupied at 3:00 PM yesterday. (9th Associated Press dispatch)

As for King Zog I and the cabinet, they have fled to Greece. (8th Havas dispatch)

(London) Italian officials here recently declared that their troops could completely occupy Albania this afternoon. (8th Havas dispatch)

(Rome) The semi-official Stefani News Agency recently issued a message stating that Foreign Minister Ciano and the Albanian Minister to Italy, Solegi, flew to the Albanian capital at 11:00 AM this morning.

The Foreign Minister immediately replied that the Prime Minister was willing to bring happiness and peace to the people within the Albanian national institutions. The Foreign Minister then inspected the local infantry units and machine gun companies at the airport. In addition, Aviation Minister Valle also flew there this morning. (9th Havas dispatch)

(Rome) Newspapers here are very angry about foreign news agencies and newspapers. The semi-official Piccolo newspaper published an editorial entitled "Defensive Action," defending the Italian army's invasion of Albania. It first criticized Albanian King Zog's inconsistent measures and threatening attitude towards Yugoslavia, and then said that patriotic Albanians had turned to Italy. Italy sent troops to land in Albania based on the obligations stipulated by the 1920 Ambassadors' Conference in order to restore order and justice. It also mentioned the oppression of Italian residents in Albania, saying that Italy's move was a legitimate act of self-defense and also to prevent the spread of chaos in the Balkans. Fortunately, Yugoslavia and Italy faithfully contacted each other to uncover the conspiracy, and Italy was able to contribute to European peace. (8th Reuters dispatch)

### Germany's Ambition Towards the Netherlands Unabated

(London) The Sunday Dispatch recently reported that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax will inform his cabinet colleagues today that he has received a report from British intelligence agencies in Germany and the Netherlands, stating that Italy's military action in Albania is merely a strategy for the dictatorships to divert international attention, and their true goal is to attack the Netherlands.

Turkish Capital: Well-informed sources recently declared that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels is scheduled to take a flight from Egypt on the 12th of this month and return to Germany quickly.

### German Newspapers Claim: National Resurrection

(Berlin) German newspapers recently took the opportunity of Easter to express their joy at the recent international events. The Munich Observer's large headline read, "Today's history is moving forward at the speed of a fast train," and said that this year's Easter is the day when the miraculous resurrection of the German nation is realized. The Essen National Daily News stated, "The resurrection of the German nation is a miracle of this world. Führer Hitler is divinely ordained to complete the great cause of national rejuvenation. All people should regard the Führer's achievements as a gift from God." (9th Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) The semi-official "German Political and Foreign Communications Report" praised Italy's invasion of Albania, stating, "From a cultural point of view, Albania has returned to the barbaric era. It is necessary for Italy to send troops to restore order and safeguard its natural rights. It is regrettable that a country with a penchant for chaos attempted to use Albania as a source of turmoil in Europe and persuaded King Zog to change course and abandon the long-standing Italian-Albanian friendly policy, which led to this event. As far as the German attitude is concerned, there is no other way but to base it on the indelible friendship between Germany and Italy. It must be known that anything that threatens Italy, once eliminated, will strengthen the power of the German-Italian axis. At a time when Western countries are talking about war, this axis is the greatest guarantee of European peace." (8th Havas dispatch)

### British Ambassador to Italy Will Soon Be Replaced, Eden Will Join the Cabinet

(London) British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine's term is expiring and he will return home within ten days. His vacant post has been internally decided to be succeeded by Sir Rowland, the ambassador to Turkey. In addition, well-informed sources predict that former Foreign Secretary Eden will rejoin the cabinet in the short term. (9th Havas dispatch)

### Analysis of German-Italian Conspiracy

(Berlin) Führer Hitler said in a speech in Wilhelmshaven on the 1st of this month that the National Socialist Party Congress to be convened in September this year will be a "Congress of Peace." When German politicians were asked about the true meaning of this statement, they replied, "All problems will be solved before September this year," and peace can be celebrated at that time. Observers here are now commenting that this statement should not be taken lightly. Germany intends to resolve all outstanding issues that hinder "German peace" in one fell swoop before September. It can be seen from this that Germany and Italy seem to have drafted a whole plan, allowing Italy to take the lead by attacking Albania, while Germany provides material assistance (it was previously reported that Germany would supply Italy with military equipment and send military experts to that country, which has recently been confirmed), and then divide Europe. Albania and Greece will be included in Italy's sphere of influence, and may even be reduced to Italian protectorates. As for Yugoslavia and Spain, they will be placed under Italian control politically in a more indirect way, and under German control economically. At the same time, Germany will develop Germanism in Eastern Europe, striving to turn all the small countries between Germany and the Soviet Union into appendages before September this year. Poland has already become the "first enemy." Politicians here openly declare that Poland has only two options: either join the German-Italian axis or disappear from the map. Germany intends to incite various ethnic minorities in Poland on the one hand, and on the other hand, to make the country's borders feel uneasy, thereby forcing it to submit. As for Romania, it has signed commercial and supplementary agreements with Germany and will be allowed to be controlled by Germany in the future. Even Hungary will be indirectly oppressed. In a nutshell, according to the National Socialist Party's view, Germany should become the only armed country in Central Europe, surrounded only by several agricultural countries whose task is to supply Germany with raw materials, and whose people are not allowed to serve in the military. (8th Havas dispatch)

(Paris) The situation in Europe was recently commented on by responsible persons here. Italian newspapers all regard the Balkans as the country's "vital space," and the country has a large-scale eastward plan. The first target is Yugoslavia and Greece. The military action against Albania is the beginning. The Italian intention to attack the Greek island of Corfu yesterday has now been proven. The United Kingdom has decided to give a security guarantee to Greece and will be responsible for protecting Corfu. The British battleship "Warspite" and the cruiser "Aberdeen" left the Italian port of Saint Remo at midnight yesterday, which should be noted. In this view, Italy's attempt on Greece has been hindered by this British action, or it will change direction and step up actions against Yugoslavia, or even suddenly occupy the entire coast of the southern country so that the United Kingdom will be caught off guard. Even Germany, which originally coveted the Adriatic Sea, will retreat. (9th Havas dispatch)

### The Approaching Storm in Europe: US Government Condemns Italy's Threat to Peace; British Navy to Concentrate in the Mediterranean for Demonstration; Important Note Delivered to Italy's Foreign Ministry Yesterday

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull, after consulting with President Roosevelt, who is currently recuperating at Warm Springs, via long-distance telephone yesterday, issued a statement saying, "Italy's act of armed aggression against Albania is a clear threat to world peace. Ignoring such events will inevitably lead to dire consequences due to short-sightedness. Every such action directly and indirectly strikes at peace-loving nations and countries around the world. At the very least, trust between nations has been completely destroyed, and the economic lives of all countries have been shaken." Although Secretary of State Hull was unwilling to explicitly state in front of the press whether Italy's actions violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact, his attitude made it clear that Italy's actions had indeed violated international non-aggression treaties. Hull repeatedly stated that Italy's "act of armed aggression against Albania is another threat to world peace." (Associated Press, 9th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull, after a long-distance telephone conversation with President Roosevelt (currently on vacation in Warm Springs), issued a statement to the press condemning Italy's invasion of Albania, and indicated that the United States might prohibit the shipment of munitions to Italy. He stated, "Italy's use of violence to invade Albania is another threat to world peace. The people of all nations desire that their governments lead them on the path to peace and do not wish to engage in war. Italy's actions are contrary to the will of the people. Moreover, after the successive occurrence of similar events, general confidence has been destroyed, world stability has been shaken, and the welfare of the United States has also been affected." Italy has now violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Senior US government officials are currently considering, in accordance with the existing Neutrality Act, an embargo on the shipment of munitions to that country, but a formal discussion has not yet taken place. (Havas, 8th)

Warm Springs, USA President Roosevelt recently issued a statement to the press, saying that he fully agrees with the statement issued by Secretary of State Hull regarding the Albanian affair. (Havas, 8th)

(London) After Italian troops entered Albania, it is generally expected here that the British naval fleet will concentrate in the Mediterranean, especially in Greek territorial waters, as a preliminary show of resistance. Once the British government provides security guarantees to Greece, it will send part of the fleet to Corfu, Greece. At that time, the majority of the British Mediterranean fleet will be concentrated east of Italy, ready to patrol the eastern Mediterranean at any time. The necessary fuel will be supplied from Palestine. (Havas, 9th)

San Remo, Italy The British 31,000-ton battleship "Warspite" and the cruiser "Aberdeen" recently anchored here.

### Diplomatic and Military Arrangements in London and Paris: Chamberlain Returns to London to Convene Cabinet Meeting; Daladier Also Convenes National Defense Meeting

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain, due to the sudden intensification of the European situation, abandoned his Easter holiday in Ringland last night and hurriedly returned to London.

The cabinet meeting is scheduled for tomorrow morning. According to diplomatic correspondents of various Sunday newspapers, the British cabinet will decide tomorrow whether to guarantee Greece and help it resist unprovoked aggression. The Sunday Dispatch reports that if this guarantee is realized, it may include British occupation of Corfu as a sign of trust. Corfu is the largest of the Ionian Islands, located near southern Albania, and the border between Albania and Greece was ruled by Britain from 1815 to 1863 before being incorporated into Greece (Reuters, 9th)

(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, accompanied by Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan, went to the office of the Imperial Defence Committee at 3:00 PM today to confer with Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Gort and Under-Secretary of State for Defence Coordination Lord Apsley.

### Great Indignation Among Muslims Everywhere

(Paris) According to news from Beirut, the capital of Syria, Muslims everywhere are very indignant about the invasion of Albania by Italian troops. Former Syrian Prime Minister Mardam stated today, "We regard Italy's aggression as the act of barbarians, like the invasion of semi-civilized people. We are sure that this matter will have a very serious reaction among the Arab nations and the Muslim world." (Reuters, 8th)

Istanbul After Italy's invasion of Albania, Turkish officials, as fellow Muslims, are both indignant and anxious, fearing that Italy will use the troops invading Albania as an advance force to conquer the Balkan Peninsula. Fortunately, all related countries are determined to guarantee independence. The Yeni Sabah newspaper reported that Bulgaria is said to covet the Dobruja region of Romania (this region originally belonged to Bulgaria, but most of it was ceded to Romania after the Second Balkan War; its residents are mostly Bulgarians). If this is realized, the Balkan Entente will be severely tested, and all countries in the Balkan Peninsula will be involved and devastated, and Bulgaria will hardly be spared. (Havas, 9th)

(Paris) The diplomatic community here was very busy today. French Foreign Minister Bonnet discussed the international situation with many foreign representatives, such as the Greek Minister and the Polish Ambassador, and later received the British Ambassador and the Albanian Chargé d'affaires. (Reuters, 8th)

(Paris) According to responsible sources, British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps informed Foreign Minister Bonnet this afternoon that the Italian Embassy had notified the British Foreign Office that Italy did not intend to harm Albania's independence, and that this matter should not be considered a violation of the British-Italian Agreement. At the same time, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also issued a similar statement to British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine. French Ambassador to Britain Couve de Murville also presented the same report. In addition, Foreign Minister Bonnet also separately received Greek Minister Politis, Polish Ambassador Łukasiewicz, and Albanian Chargé d'affaires Memed, discussing the Albanian affair. (Havas, 8th)

(Paris) Le Journal reports that its London correspondent telegraphed that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had given guarantees to British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine three days ago, stating that Italy had no intention of harming Albania's independence and sovereignty. Some people in London political circles believe that such promises are unreliable, and the British government may collapse and summon Ambassador Loraine "back to the country to report on the battle." (Havas, 9th)

### Easter: Pope Appeals for Peace; The Way to Peace Depends on Faithfulness and Understanding; and Disarmament in Material and Spiritual Matters

Vatican City Pope Pius XII, during the Easter Mass ceremony held at St. Peter's Basilica today, broadcast a short speech calling for peace, stating that the disturbing and dissatisfying feelings that trouble our souls almost make us believe that the days to come will worsen, as if there will be no peace, tranquility and order in the truth. Even our children are divided due to mutual differences and partisan conflicts. When many people are unemployed, lose their livelihoods, and are easily poisoned by destruction, there is no peace to speak of. Only understanding can encourage people to move forward on the path of civilized progress. If solemnly signed agreements and oaths lose their value, then there is no peace to speak of, because this value is a necessary basis for mutual trust. Without these two, the disarmament hoped for by the public in material and spiritual matters will become less and less likely to be realized. The way to remedy this evil is for the souls of mankind to turn to Christ, because peace and justice depend on Christ. The result of peace is tranquility. Only in this way can mankind return to the right path of mutual friendship and understanding, and then all parties can respect the legitimate interests of all countries with goodwill and understanding, and not avoid sacrifices for the happiness of mankind, and each will abide by solemn oaths with the highest aspirations. (Reuters, 9th)

Vatican City Pope Pius XII, since ascending the throne, held the Easter Mass at St. Peter's Basilica and later gave a speech via radio broadcast, condemning all kinds of actions that violate treaties and break promises. At the same time, he advocated respecting human dignity and freedom of rights, and allocating various resources in a fair manner. His speech included, "If the nations cannot understand each other, what value is there in the treaties solemnly accepted and the promises provided, then peace is hopeless, because these treaties and promises are the basis of mutual trust. Once they lose their effect, then the matter of reducing armaments, whether in material or spiritual matters, becomes more and more difficult to achieve. Without order, how can there be peace? Without justice, how can there be order? Justice is nothing more than obeying legitimate officials, and laws are aimed at general welfare. Human freedom and dignity should be respected, and the resources of the world should be distributed in a fair manner." (Havas, 9th)

### The Issue of Unification of North and South Ireland

(London) According to a telegram from the Dublin correspondent of the Sunday Times, regarding the issue of the unification of North and South Ireland, the British and American governments are conducting important talks with the Irish Republic and the authorities of Northern Ireland. "If these negotiations are successful, then in the event of future wars, the American army and navy will gain certain conveniences in Ireland." It is reported that US President Roosevelt has high hopes for the unification of North and South Ireland. Eamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Republic, is scheduled to visit the United States next month, and there is no doubt that he will play an important role in the current negotiations. It is also rumored that if the UK and the US can guarantee the safety of Ireland, then the Irish Republic is prepared to provide its ports for the use of American warships and merchant ships, and to allow the American army to be stationed in the country when necessary. At that time, Irish people who do not want to join the British army "can join the American army. Although Northern Ireland can maintain its original government, it should join the Irish Federal Government. The preferential treatment it enjoys in its commercial dealings with the UK should still be maintained, and at the same time, the US should grant it certain preferential treatment." (Havas, 8th)

### Canada's Attitude Undecided

Ottawa A recent issue of the Canadian Press newspaper stated, "When the House of Commons recently discussed foreign policy issues, a proposal made by a certain member of parliament was very noteworthy. The main point was that the UK, the US, and Canada should conclude a North Atlantic military alliance treaty and allow it to take effect in the Pacific. Several other members of parliament expressed friendship towards the US, and this tendency may replace the spirit of consultation within the British Empire. In short, within the House of Commons, the people who advocate that the UK, the US, and Canada sign a defense agreement have already gained momentum." The "certain member of parliament" mentioned in the report refers to Vancouver member of parliament Green, who initially had no reputation, but recently advocated that the UK, the US, and Canada conclude an alliance treaty to protect the Canadian coast and resist the Japanese threat. The Canadian government has not considered it. Minister of Justice Lapointe even gave a speech saying that Canada's current foreign policy is based on maintaining friendly relations with the US. US President Roosevelt also gave a speech at Kingston University last year when he received an honorary doctorate, saying that the US is very willing to cooperate in maintaining the territorial integrity of Canada. At this point, the defense authorities of the US and Canada have already been cooperating closely in practice informally. However, the US public opinion is unwilling to publicly conclude alliance treaties with other countries, even if the allied countries are American countries, and the Canadian officials are well aware of this. (Havas, 8th)

### Argentina Searches Nazi Party Organs and Captures a Spy

Buenos Aires, Argentina Since the sabotage plot by the German Nazi Party in Patagonia Province in southern Argentina was uncovered, the police authorities again searched the organs of the Nazi Party in the town of Comodoro Rivadavia in the province, confiscating many documents and photos, and arrested Nazi Party spy Groh in the port of Bahia Blanca. Immediately, important evidence was found in his suitcase. He had been a German official and was about to leave the country by ship when he was arrested. In addition, the federal prosecutor has also notified the police chief, Cordoba, to investigate the activities of Nazi Party members in the capital. Chief Cordoba will search the various organizations of the Nazi Party, and it is expected that many gains will be made at that time. (Havas, 8th)

### Britain Will Guarantee the Independence of Greece and Turkey, and Will Announce the Abolition of the Anglo-Italian Agreement; The Times Criticizes Italy for Dishonesty

(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this morning to discuss the situation in the eastern Mediterranean. It is said that it has been decided to immediately negotiate mutual assistance agreements with Greece and Turkey. In addition, the current situation of Spain after joining the Anti-Comintern Pact is also of concern to the British Cabinet. Some say that Italy has recently sent troops to Spain again, while others say that Italian troops have already begun to withdraw. There are many conflicting rumors. As far as the British government's response is concerned, the Anglo-Italian Agreement may not be declared abolished. However, after the sudden outbreak of the Albanian incident, it has to be admitted that this agreement has been destroyed by Italy. It is said that Italy will be asked to fulfill its promises and quickly withdraw its troops from Spain. (Havas, 8th)

(Paris) Regarding the organization of a collective security system, in addition to negotiating a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, the UK is now conducting separate negotiations with Greece, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. Regarding guaranteeing the safety of Greece, responsible officials here recently stated that the British government launched this proposal because of rumors that Italy intends to occupy the Greek island of Corfu, and had to take preemptive measures. In order to quickly establish an agreement with Greece, the French government will naturally cooperate closely with the UK. Regarding Romania, the talks between the UK and that country have to be delayed for several days because that country must first establish an agreement with Poland. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is in Istanbul, Turkey, conducting talks with Turkish authorities. If success can be achieved, it will benefit the UK through the Dardanelles. Regarding Turkey, although the UK is disputing with France over the Sanjak region, British people generally believe that the Anglo-Turkish alliance collective security organization will be formed. Regarding the Soviet Union, because Poland still has doubts about that country, talks between the UK and the Soviet Union must wait until the Polish guarantee issue is completely resolved before they can enter the decisive stage. In summary, the UK is contacting the related countries in the manner described above. Responsible officials here all believe that if the threat from Germany and Italy intensifies, all diplomatic difficulties can be solved easily. (Havas, 8th)

(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times said that people in London now regard Italy's occupation of Albania as a very serious change in the European situation, and Italy's credibility has also suffered a major blow. Since the Anglo-Italian Agreement has been destroyed, the question of whether Britain should declare this agreement null and void has now arisen. Britain may be forced to adopt measures that it does not want to take and declare this agreement invalid. Another matter is even more important: the independence of Greece and Turkey should be maintained. Greece and Turkey are now greatly alarmed by the occupation of Albania and the concentration of Italian troops on the Dodecanese Islands. Responsible officials in London believe that if Greece is attacked, Britain will definitely provide assistance. When the British Cabinet meets, it may make a final decision on this matter. (Reuters, 9th)

Warsaw Responsible officials here recently stated that regarding the future fate of the city of Danzig, the construction of a highway by Germany through the Polish Corridor, and other issues, Poland is still willing to consult with Germany in accordance with the 1934 Non-Aggression Pact and the 1937 Joint Declaration on Minorities to find a solution. Regarding the city of Danzig, Poland is prepared to discuss with Germany the legal status of the city after it withdraws from the League of Nations. However, if Germany wants to place the market under its sovereignty or weaken Polish rights, it will be rejected. As for unilaterally changing the current legal status of the market or recklessly invading, Poland will regard it as an invasion of its country and rise up to deal with it. Regarding the construction of a highway, Poland can allow it to be built and is willing to grant Germany certain preferential treatment, especially customs preferences, as it has done for the German railway line (which also passes through the Polish Corridor). However, its sovereignty must be maintained. Also, regarding the minority issue, the German minority in Poland has not yet engaged in widespread disturbances, but Germany's propaganda campaign has not stopped and has even intensified. (Havas, 8th)

### The Cantonese Provincial Army's General Counteroffensive: Situation on the Three Fronts, Employing a Feint Attack to Confuse the Japanese, Coordinating with New Air Force to Counterattack Japanese Strongholds

Hong Kong Dispatch: At the same time that a major battle unfolded in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese army, drawing four regiments from various locations on Hainan Island back to Guangzhou, intended to launch a surprise attack on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border, concentrating its main force in various strongholds surrounding the northeastern suburbs. Simultaneously, they employed a feint attack, advancing towards Beijie in Jiangmen, to disrupt the Chinese army's target. The Chinese side, having detected their scheme, specifically divided its forces into three routes for strict defense. Starting from the 3rd, in coordination with the new air force, they began a counteroffensive against the Japanese army's outer strongholds. The situation on the three fronts is recorded below:

Eastern River: The Eastern River front is the responsibility of the Wu Qigong department of the ×th Army Corps. The Huang Tao division, stationed opposite Longmen, launched a rapid assault on the strongholds of Zengcheng, Paitan, and Zhengguo via multiple routes. The Third Guerrilla Region's Luo Fengxiang designated the Bu Laoyang, Lin Junsheng, and Chen Nan detachments to move towards Boluo, Lianhexu, Changning, Longhua, and other places, crossing Niu Pi Path, Lychee Ridge, and Bo Gong Ridge to attack the right flank of Zengcheng. On the afternoon of March 30th, the Huang Tao division engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army south of Zhengguo Xu, killing over one thousand Japanese and puppet troops and seizing a large quantity of military supplies. The Bu, Lin, and Chen guerrilla teams engaged the Japanese army fiercely east of Zengcheng all day, without a decisive outcome. At 2 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, eighteen Chinese air force planes, divided into upper and lower layers, appeared over Shilong, tumbling and diving like falcons, swiftly dropping bombs, all of which hit their targets. Eight large bombs landed in Shilong, and six large bombs landed in Shitan. The Japanese army's accumulated grain, machinery, tanks, etc., were reduced to ashes. Civilian housing also suffered significant damage. As the Chinese planes departed, they scattered leaflets, advising the Japanese army to reflect immediately, and voluntarily cease fighting. Wang Ruozhou, Zhang Wodong, Yuan Huazhao, and others, the guerrilla commanders of the Fourth District stationed in Shilong, Dongguan, had previously received a secret order from Wu Qigong to simultaneously attack the rear of the Japanese army in the Eastern River area. On March 28th and 29th, the forward scouts of the Chinese army had already made contact with the Japanese army in the Lychee Ridge area of Zengcheng. The Fourth District Guerrilla immediately divided their forces into three routes to attack Dongguan, Taiping, and Shilong. The first route followed the Wan-Zhang (Mutou) Highway, pressing the attack on Liaobu and Dalang, advancing towards Dongguan City. The second route departed from Hengli and Nanshe, taking a diagonal course through Xiakou, cutting off traffic on the Wan-Long Highway. The third route went straight to Huangwuzhou from Ma Si Jutou, surrounding the back of Shilong. Zhang Woshu and Deng Tan were respectively appointed as front-line commanders. The major battle began on the 30th. The Japanese army stationed in Dongguan City was the Arakawa unit, numbering five hundred men. On the 28th, they had moved along the Wan-Long Highway towards Zengcheng, and the Suzuki unit was reassigned to take over the defense of Dongguan City, with its headquarters established at Mingsheng Middle School and the People's Education Center. On the 29th, several dozen tanks and transport vehicles arrived at Taiping in Humen, having just been unloaded from Japanese warships, and moved along the Guang-Hu and Wan-Da Highways, stored in the warehouse at the Baisha Airfield. The Taiping area was defended by the Okada unit, numbering five hundred men, along with a large cavalry squadron. When the Chinese army launched its counteroffensive on the 30th, a large number of Japanese tanks and cavalry moved out to meet the attack. The Chinese air force flew towards the enemy warehouse in Baisha and dropped bombs, two of which hit the target. At present, intense fighting is underway throughout the Eastern River area.

Western River: The Japanese army in the Sanshui Jiaowei area has adopted a defensive posture since March, with the majority retreating towards Foshan. Only sixty or so men remain on the Hekou front. Sanshui Station and Sanshui City each have just over one hundred men. The Japanese army in various locations such as Mumian, Makougang, Xikeng, Dengshi, and Baoling are all building defensive fortifications. Their talk of advancing on Lubaou will not be realized.

Northern River: Yu Hanmou, commander-in-chief of the ××th Army Corps, recently went to Guilin to attend the Southwest Headquarters Conference. The plan for defending northern Guangdong has been completely decided. The army corps stationed on the Yuehan Railway front is proceeding cautiously, adopting a defensive-offensive strategy. The railway tracks south of Juntian have all been dismantled. The front lines of Shengang, Dagangling, Maoergang, Lubaou, Baini, Luotian, Shiling, Pingshan, Xiangshan, Shijiao, Taipingchang, Zhongluotan, Fuhe, Zhengguo, and other markets that are near the Japanese army's strongholds, are where the Chinese army can act freely. In the past two months, encounters have occurred frequently. The above-mentioned locations are only thirty li from Guangzhou City, so the Japanese army is actively dispatching troops to defend the perimeter of Guangzhou. If the Chinese army carries out a large-scale general counteroffensive, Guangzhou will immediately be under Chinese army control.

### North Jiangsu Chinese Army Rapidly Advances to Huaiyin; Large Detachment Crosses Hongze Lake; Japanese Planes Bombard Various Counties in North Jiangsu

Taixian Correspondence: Since the Chinese army launched guerrilla warfare and positional warfare on the North Jiangsu battlefront, the two sides have now developed a seesaw battle situation. The Chinese army has repeatedly recaptured the county towns of Funing and Huaian, but in order to seize the initiative, they have given them up. Each time, they have killed quite a few enemy troops. On the Canal front, a certain unit of the Chinese army is advancing north, and has now progressed to the Erbao area north of Pingqiao Town. At the same time, a large detachment of a certain unit of the Chinese army stationed in Sixian County, Anhui, has crossed Hongze Lake and is rapidly advancing towards Huaiyin. Further news: There are currently only two hundred or so Japanese soldiers in Huaian City. The Japanese army recently shot twenty-eight major and minor puppet officials of the puppet maintenance association in the city. There is talk of preparing to abandon Huaian.

The Japanese army in the Yangzhou area on the southern line of the Grand Canal originally had extremely weak forces. A few days ago, reinforcements of five or six hundred men arrived, but eight or nine out of ten are "pacification troops" disguised as such. The Japanese army forbids these people from speaking. Although Zhaoguan Dam is currently occupied by the Japanese army, the Chinese side is constantly launching fierce counterattacks, and the Japanese army is really finding it difficult to hold on. The Chinese army has now advanced to a certain location three li from Zhaoguan Dam. The Japanese army is actively building defensive fortifications and has completed the construction of the highway from Shaobo to Zhaoguan Dam to prevent a general counteroffensive by the Chinese army. Also, the Kousei Saburo unit of the Japanese army stationed in Huangjiao Bridge has now been entirely transferred to Zhaoguan Dam to increase defenses, intending to hold this stronghold to the death.

For days, Japanese planes have been dispatched in all directions to bomb. On the 2nd, they bombed Pingqiao Town. The residents of that area suffered some casualties. At 8:45 AM on the morning of the 3rd, two Japanese planes were again spotted over Yancheng, dropping four bombs, killing and injuring many civilians. They did not flee northeast until 9:05 AM. At 9:55 AM on the morning of the 4th, another Japanese plane came to Dongtai to bomb. At 10:00 AM on the same morning, three Japanese planes returned to Yancheng and dropped eight bombs, destroying more than ten civilian houses. At around 9:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, five Japanese seaplanes came to Dongtai again and dropped seventeen bombs in succession, killing seven or eight civilians and injuring several others. Several civilian houses on the riverbank were also destroyed by the bombing.

The Japanese army in the Tongru area is constantly attacked by Chinese guerrilla units, with contact occurring almost every day. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, thirty or forty Japanese and puppet soldiers set out from the west gate of Rugao to patrol Hongjia Village. The Chinese guerrilla unit launched a fierce attack head-on. Fierce fighting broke out between the two sides. In half an hour, the Chinese army killed four Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army fled in droves back into Rugao City, and to prevent guerrilla units from pursuing from behind, they fired three artillery shells on the west gate city wall as a warning. One shell landed in Liumen Township, injuring a local villager. It is said that the Japanese army in Tongru numbers about one thousand men, including many puppet troops mixed in.

### The Current Situation of the New Capital of Xikang Province; Various Organizations Promote National Salvation Work

Kangding Dispatch: This reporter arrived in Lu (Kangding) nearly a month ago. After several days of inspection in the provincial capital, the local situation has been roughly understood. Here is a record of what was learned from the investigation, divided into sections:

A Casual Discussion of the Past: Kangding was anciently the land of Sanwei. During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, it was Western Qiang. During the Han dynasty, it was the Maoniu Kingdom. In the sixth year of the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a county was established, subordinate to Qinghai. During Zhuge Liang's southern expedition during the Shu Han period, he left Guo Da stationed in Yutong to appease the people. Da set up a furnace in the Kangding Mountains to make arrows. This is the origin of the name Dajianlu (arrow-making furnace). During the Jin dynasty, it was Western Rong. During the Tang dynasty, it was subordinate to Tubo, and the tea-horse trade became increasingly frequent. The Five Dynasties and Song dynasties continued this. During the Yuan dynasty, it belonged to the Western Fan Changhexi Pacification Commission. In the fifth year of the Yongle reign of the Ming dynasty, the chieftain Awang Jiantai was awarded the title of Mingzheng Zhang for accompanying the expedition, governing the Yutong and Kongyu chieftaincies, and also serving as the Ningyuan Military and Civilian Pacification Envoy, a hereditary position. In the 39th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing dynasty, the chieftain Xila Zhakeba was killed by Tibetan officials Changce Jilie and others. The governor of Sichuan sent troops to put down the rebellion, and his son Shen Qin Tiande succeeded him. Later, it was changed to Dajianlu Associate Magistrate's Hall, subordinate to Yazhou Prefecture. Among the various chieftaincies under its jurisdiction, Mingzheng was the most respected. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign, Feng Quan, the Qing Dynasty's Assistant Minister stationed in Tibet, was killed by Tibetan mobs in Batang due to his arrogance and self-will. The Qing court appointed Yue Erfeng as the Border Affairs Minister, leading troops to quell the rebellion. After a year of conquest, in the 34th year of Guangxu, Dajianlu was changed to a Directly Subordinate Hall, under the jurisdiction of the Jianchang Dao, which governed the Six Grain Roads outside the pass. In the third year of the Xuantong reign, the land of the three chieftaincies was changed from hereditary to appointed magistrates. In the first year of the Republic of China, Yin Changheng led troops on a western expedition and changed Dajianlu to Kangding Prefecture. A Pacification Prefecture was established in the prefectural city, and various departments were established with himself as the Pacification Envoy, commanding the various armies and governing the various counties. In the second year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Internal Affairs standardized the national administrative regions and changed it to Kangding County, incorporating Anliang County. On New Year's Day of this year, the establishment of Xikang Province was realized, and it was designated as the provincial capital. The provincial government is located here, and the county seat remains as before. A Kangding Municipal Committee has now been established.

An Important Town in Western Territory: Xikang is internally subordinate to Sichuan and Yunnan, externally bordering Tibet and the south connecting to Burma, and the north linking to Qinghai. Since ancient times, it has been a key area on the western border. In the late Qing dynasty, the Qing court, due to the precarious situation in Kang and Tibet, with strong neighbors eyeing it from the outside and border residents rebelling from within, specially appointed Zhao Erfeng as the Sichuan-Yunnan Border Affairs Minister to actively manage and prepare for the establishment of a province. Zhao, with sufficient support from the central government and assistance from neighboring provinces, handled the matter of changing from hereditary to appointed magistrates throughout the border area. Wherever the military power reached, the barbarians were subdued. Within a few years, more than thirty counties were established. At that time, he stationed his headquarters in Ba'an, believing that the climate was mild, the products were abundant, and the situation was strategically important, no less than a southern frontier barrier. He planned to establish it as the capital, and all planned provincial construction was centered on Ba'an. People from Sichuan Province and missionaries from Britain and France flocked to Ba'an. Ba'an already had the prototype of a provincial capital. Later, due to the Qing Dynasty's overthrow, the Tibetan barbarians took the opportunity to invade, and more than ten counties in western Kang fell one after another. The people in charge of border affairs were repeatedly changed, perfunctorily and permissively, and the situation deteriorated. Gradually, the border situation worsened. After the Liu Wenhui unit of the 24th Army took over the defense, they used military force to recover Dengke, Dege, Baiyu, and Shiqu, completing the rule east of the Jinsha River. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the enemy has invaded deeper, and the territory has shrunk daily. Xikang is not only a barrier to the southwest national defense but also related to the future center of international transportation. Kangding has always been a transportation hub between Sichuan and Tibet and is now the capital of Xikang Province. The military and political affairs are both strategically important, thus forming an important town in the western territory.

A Tour of the Mountain City: Kangding is located on a plateau more than eight thousand seven hundred feet above sea level, situated among the surrounding mountains of Mount Paoma, Mount Guoda, and Mount Zierpo. The peaks are towering, and the high places are covered with snow all year round. The city is in a mountain valley, with the Zheduo River running through it. Han and Tibetan people live together, building houses with stacked stones, and forming markets along the river. Goods from Sichuan, Tibet, and central Kang are mostly concentrated here, with tea, medicinal materials, and furs being the main items of trade. In previous years, the climate in the urban area was extremely cold. In winter, the eaves of the houses had icicles hanging down, like glass railings. Every morning, merchants would get up early to break these ice railings before displaying their goods for business. This year, since the establishment of the provincial government, the population has increased sharply, and the climate has changed, not as strangely cold as in previous years. However, because it is surrounded by mountains, the air is not harmonious, and every afternoon, a storm arises. If it blows head-on, not only is breathing suffocated, but even cattle and sheep are often knocked over. On the day of the abolished lunar New Year's Day, this reporter made a city tour to peek into the barbaric customs of this border area. Descending from Mount Zierpo, entering Zhongzheng Street, at the time, the snow had just cleared, and the spring cold was biting. The white snow on the mountain dazzled the eyes. Looking up at the peak of Mount Haizi (there is a lake on the top of the mountain, which is rarely visited by people due to the high altitude), the snow and mist were hazy, and the clouds were indistinguishable. The harsh caw of the crow stirred the thoughts of the border. Arriving at the market street, seeing the shops on both sides, covered with Spring Festival couplets, all closed, because the people adhere to the old customs, and the lunar calendar is still difficult to abolish. That day (the 19th) happened to be the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. Various agencies, legal entities, schools, and shops hung the national flag to celebrate. Residents, whether Han or Tibetan, men and women, mostly wore new clothes, and greeted each other for the New Year. Turning east, crossing the Middle Bridge, to Zhongshan Street, along the way seeing Tibetan men, wearing newly made large fur robes, with sleeves almost touching the ground, tied with large belts, hitting money purses, wearing fur hats, wearing long cylinder boots, coming and going to celebrate the New Year. Turning west from Zhongshan Road, crossing the Upper Bridge, turning to Laoshan Street, walking to the front of the Gospel Church, seeing many Tibetan women, newly dressed, wearing large robes, wearing wide belts around their waists, braids crisscrossed on their heads, tied with red ropes, long earrings hanging from their ears, inlaid with ornaments, keys hanging from their waists, because it was the abolished lunar New Year, their faces were painted with powder, vying for beauty, showing off to each other. From time to time, there were people throwing dice to gamble on the street, with gongs and drums, occasionally interspersed with the sound of firecrackers, and there were people playing the huqin and singing Peking opera. Arriving at Beiguan, it gradually became desolate. Entering Zhongzheng Park, the eyes were full of desolation, nothing to see. Returning west, entering the General Temple, going straight to the main hall, the incense in front of the statues of gods was lingering, making it difficult to open the eyes. Seeing a young woman kneeling in front of the gods to draw lots. In a small room on the east side, an old monk was sitting cross-legged, beating drums and cymbals, chanting scriptures. Among them were Han and Tibetan children, playing with money. Under the porch of the temple gate, there were several male beggars begging here. The Spring Festival couplets posted on the door were all in Tibetan. After visiting, turning from Zhuge Street, climbing Mount Zierpo and returning. Just as I arrived at my residence, the wind and snow filled the sky again (to be continued).

### Will Forcibly Levy Land Price Tax, and Hold Other Harsh Taxes

Hangzhou Correspondence: Since the Hangzhou puppet municipal government canceled the department store tax, there has been no revenue, so that all the puppet officials, large and small, are in arrears of salary, and several disputes have occurred as a result. Recently, the puppet mayor, in order to increase revenue again, also drafted the Land Price Tax Law, the method of which generally follows the rules set by the former municipal government, but the tax standards are higher than before, with each mu taxed at a rate of ten per thousand of the land price, and has been approved by the puppet provincial government, will be implemented next month. And the new harsh taxes that have recently been implemented include the so-called maintenance fee (also known as the Baojia expense), which is divided into four grades of A, B, C, and D, and collected monthly from each household by the puppet police station, and there is also a grain export tax, where all grain transported for sale must be obtained from the puppet municipal government before a certificate is obtained, and the license fee is one corner per stone.

### YMCA Volleyball Group A: Fang Gang Jia vs. Russian Army Tonight at 8:45

There are three YMCA volleyball matches tonight. The first match is between Women's 1 After-School and Fanla A. Fanla A has won all three matches and is very strong. The After-School lineup is also quite neat, but unfortunately, they were discouraged in the first battle against Youxing. If they try their best to compete at that time, they will definitely pose a threat to Fanla. The second match is between Group B1 Monala and St. Francis. Both teams have repeatedly lost battles and are nothing to watch. The third match is between Group A Fang Guang Jia and the Russian Army. The Russian Army was the champion of the previous session. They lost their first battle to Haiqing, but their strength is still strong. Fang Gang is afraid that it will be difficult to blunt their edge. The order for today is recorded below: After-School vs. Fanla A (Women's 2) 7:15

Monala vs. St. Francis (B1) 8:00 PM

Russian Army vs. Fang Gang Jia (Group A) 8:45

### CYMCA Fudan Alumni Charitable Basketball Game: First Match on the Evening of the 15th

The CYMCA Sports Department in Ba Xian Qiao and the Fudan Alumni Association will hold a charitable basketball game, starring the Fudan alumni and the CYMCA team. The entire competition consists of three matches. The first match will be held on the afternoon of this Friday (the 15th) at 8:00 PM in the CYMCA gymnasium. When the Fudan basketball team entertained the press earlier, Mr. Wang Sifang of the school's alumni association and Mr. Peng Sanmei, representing the CYMCA, immediately agreed on the spot and actively proceeded with it. Preparations have now been completed and a date has been set for the event. Tickets are one yuan, and all proceeds will be used for refugee relief. The CYMCA team has strong players such as Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Chen Xianglong, Kong Guangyi, Xu Jusheng, Jia Youliang, Liang Guoquan, Qu Xilin, and Dong Yangfeng.

In addition to the original Sun Huipei, Zhou Dayun, Chen Hechong, Zhang Jinxiang, Lu Dazhen, Chuan Xiangrui, Zheng Boyi, Song Qihou, Zhou Jun and others, the alumni team has recently acquired Cai Yanxiong, and its strength has become even stronger. When they compete at that time, there will be a fierce fight, and give the fans a full feeling. In addition to seeking a strong physique and studying basketball skills, the only obligation that sports athletes living on isolated islands should fulfill is to do more charity games and relieve refugees.

It is expected that there will be a sensation for a while. In addition, Jiang Yiping, an old classmate of Fudan, initiated the combination of Xi Yushu, Li Zulai, Wu Falai, Shen Kunnan, Zhang Weiran and others to form a Fudan Old Man team, willing to fight against the old man teams of other schools and participate in this charity game.

### French Ambassador to China, Kosimo, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; After Inspecting the Honor Guard, He Went to the Embassy; Then He Went to the Catholic Church to Attend the Worship; The Meeting Between Ambassadors Klein and Cole Seems to Have No Political Meaning

French Ambassador to China, Kosimo, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 9:30 AM at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession after presenting his credentials in Chongqing, transferred to Hong Kong and took the gunship Dadwoo. The French Consul General in Shanghai and French business leaders all came to the port to welcome him. The ambassador and the military attache of the embassy disembarked the ship, with military music playing loudly. He then inspected the honor guard, and after a brief meeting with the welcoming staff, he went straight to the French Embassy in Shanghai on the Bund of the French Great Road to rest. Then, accompanied by the French Consul, he went to the Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street to attend the worship.

Mr. Klein's Earnest Statement

Mainland newspapers reported that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Klein, and British Ambassador to China, Sir Cole, exchanged views for two days and discussed issues of "common interest." However, before departing for Tokyo on Friday, Ambassador Klein reiterated that their talks had no political meaning. Given that Ambassador Klein's trip to China was the first time, his earnest statement can be believed on the surface. Historically, British diplomats appointed as ambassadors to Japan have taken the route through Shanghai and discussed the Eastern situation with the ambassador to China first. However, Ambassador Klein took the route through Canada for his inauguration without passing through Shanghai, so he was unable to meet with Ambassador Cole. Although Ambassador Klein's arrival in Shanghai coincided with Ambassador Cole's departure for Chongqing yesterday (the 8th),

Mediation of the War Cannot Be Believed

However, there are several reasons why rumors of British mediation in the Sino-Japanese War cannot be believed. Britain's policy on the Sino-Japanese War has been clearly announced repeatedly, that is, Britain will only consider it if one of the warring parties requests mediation. Recent events have clearly shown that neither side has made this request or even considered it. Yesterday, responsible parties in Shanghai claimed that the Chinese government's attitude towards Wang Jingwei's peace proposal was a clear expression of Chairman Chiang's policy of fighting to the end. At the same time, Britain's confidence in this attitude has been expressed through recent credit loans, and Japan is unlikely to suddenly ask Britain to mediate.

Japanese Newspapers' Fierce Anti-English Tone

In recent weeks, editorials in Japanese newspapers and Chinese newspapers controlled by the Japanese have had a fierce anti-English tone, clearly reflecting the views of the Japanese government. Therefore, the general public believes that if Japan asks another country to mediate, Britain must be the last country chosen to undertake this task. It is believed that Sir Klein has obtained direct information on some long-pending disputes between Britain and Japan caused by the Japanese invasion of China, the main ones being the armed seizure of railways and the blockade of trade routes such as the Yangtze River. At the same time, outside speculation about Ambassador Cole's trip to Chongqing was also refuted by responsible parties. It is said that since the credit loan was agreed upon, the British ambassador has had no chance to meet with Chairman Chiang.

Japanese Speculation is the Opposite

The Japanese Shanghai Daily News speculated in the opposite direction from the opinions of the responsible British, saying that because Sir Klein and Ambassador Cole have fundamental differences in opinion, their Shanghai talks seemed to have failed. The newspaper also expressed its view as the reason for this decision to hold talks, that Britain believes that promoting peace in China is in its own interest, because it can maintain its position in Europe and protect its interests in China. The results of the talks have been reported to the British government, so what kind of changes will the British foreign policy make in the future? It is very noteworthy. The newspaper also reprinted the conversation when the Japanese authorities hosted Sir Klein at a banquet on Friday, saying that Mr. Morishima, the counselor of the Japanese embassy, ​​said, we have frankly exchanged views on the situation of the China Incident.

The Talks Seem to Have No Political Meaning

As for the talks between Sir Klein and Ambassador Cole, they seem to have no political meaning. Although we don't know what they talked about, we believe that any talks between the two ambassadors will change the British foreign policy. This time will also be the case.

### The Ships Detained at Songkou Have Not Yet Been Released; The Ship's Food Supply Is About to Run Out; The Portuguese Consul Visited the Japanese Consul Twice Without Success; Each Ship Is Forced to Fly the Japanese Flag; Passengers Were Safe Until Yesterday Afternoon

Nine Portuguese ships, including Hailong Meda, were detained by Japanese warships on the sea surface of Dinghai, and after being forced to sail to Songkou to anchor, they have not been released until 6:00 PM yesterday. Tanglu Wheel telegraphed that food was about to run out and panic was starting. The Portuguese Consul thought the situation was serious, and although yesterday was a regular holiday, the office was still open as usual. The Portuguese Consul visited the Japanese Consul twice without success. Negotiations will continue today. Huamei Company, an American company, has telegraphed its general manager, Mr. Honto, stationed in Hong Kong, to report that except for Portuguese merchant ships, which are temporarily suspended, other German and Italian merchant ships continue to operate and maintain shipping. The following is a report from a modern news reporter on the situation:

The Detained Ships Remain at Songkou

The Portuguese Atlantic Hailong, Zhengde Libao, Meili Meda, and Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, and Tang Lu, which are represented by the American Huamei Company, as well as diesel-powered clapboard ships Baode and Mime, were detained and inspected by Japanese warships on the sea surface of Dinghai on the 6th and 7th of this month, respectively, while en route from Shanghai to Wenzhou. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, under the supervision of Japanese warships, they were forced to sail to Tongsha waters outside Songkou to anchor. The Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai reported to the Japanese side and made oral representations, but the Japanese Consul excused himself by saying that he had not received a report, so there was no result. Yesterday, the detained ships were still anchored in Tongsha waters and were being monitored by Japanese warships. Until 6:00 PM, there was no news of their release.

The Portuguese Consul Visited the Japanese Consul Twice Without Success

Since receiving the reports from the ship companies, the Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai believed that the matter concerned the interests of Portuguese merchants and the safety of crew members and passengers, so although yesterday was a regular holiday, the consulate still opened as usual. The Portuguese Consul General visited the Japanese Consulate at around 11:00 AM yesterday to see Consul General Miura, but he was unable to meet him due to the Sunday holiday. He agreed with the staff of the consulate to visit again at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, hoping to notify the Japanese Consul to wait for the meeting. However, when he visited again in the afternoon, he was still unable to meet him, so he decided to continue to make strong representations to the Japanese Consulate today, demanding the immediate release of the detained ships, so as to protect the rule of law and maintain the national system.

Tanglu Telegraphed that There Was a Food Panic

The American Huamei Company in this city received a telegram from the owner of the Tanglu ship yesterday morning, saying that the food on board was about to run out and panic was about to start, and asking for prompt assistance, etc. The company immediately reported to the Portuguese Consul for negotiations. The crew of the detained ships, including the shipowners, chief mates, old sailors, cooks, stokers, and tea boys, totaled 600 people. The number of passengers totaled between 1,500 and 2,000 on each ship. Although the Taiping grain loaded on each ship, such as Tangbei, Tangqiao, Meda, and Hailong, was still abundant, because they had been detained for three days, there was a risk of running out of food. Moreover, one of the ships, Libao, sailed from Ningbo on the afternoon of the 5th when Zhenhai was declared closed, and it has been four days since yesterday. There were more than 300 passengers on board, so the food problem will be more serious than on other ships, which is generally worried about. However, it is known that as of yesterday afternoon, all the crew members and passengers were still quite well.

American Merchants Sent an Urgent Telegram to General Manager Honto

It is learned that Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, and Tang Lu, three of the detained Portuguese ships, are leased and represented by the American Huamei Shipping Company at No. 333 Simalu Road. Since the detention incident occurred, the Portuguese shipowners reported to the Portuguese Consul and asked for negotiations. However, the company's general manager, Mr. Honto, happened to go to Hong Kong for business, so there was no way to ask for instructions. Now, the company believes that the situation is serious and urgently telegraphed Hong Kong yesterday to report the situation to Mr. Honto and ask for instructions on how to deal with it, and telegraphed the US Consul General in Shanghai to make representations, and hoped that he would return to Shanghai on the same day to preside over the matter.

The Shanghai-Wenzhou Route Operates as Usual

Although Portuguese ships such as Hailong and Meda operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route were illegally detained by Japanese warships, shipping companies from Germany and Italy still sent ships to operate as usual in order to maintain the Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping. The Moufu ship of the German Lihe Foreign Firm and the Deping ship of the Italian Zhongyi Company arrived in Wenzhou the night before last, and were scheduled to load cargo today and return to Shanghai. The Seli ship of the Italian Huayi Foreign Firm and the Feikang ship of the German Lulin Foreign Firm both telegraphed that they would sail to Shanghai one after another yesterday afternoon. The Haifa ship of the German Lihe Foreign Firm sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou at 4:00 AM yesterday. The Hana ship of the Yuanjian Company will also sail as soon as the ship is tidied up. As for Portuguese Tang Sai, Meifa, and Shantay, etc., because the detention incident has not been resolved and the truth is unknown, it has been decided to postpone the sailing temporarily.

Forcing the Japanese Flag to Be Hung Is Safe for Passengers

The shipowner of Meda of the Portuguese Meili Company sent a wireless message from the ship yesterday, reporting to the company and the Portuguese Consul, saying: "Since last night (ie the night before last), we have been forced to change to flying the Japanese flag, and the crew and passengers are safe and sound. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with a foreign ship passenger who arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The detained Portuguese merchant ships are now all anchored outside Wusongkou, but the Japanese flag has been hung on the mast, and the Portuguese merchant ship flag is still hanging. There are Japanese warships parked nearby, which seem to be monitoring the detained Portuguese ships.

Libao Imported Under Surveillance

After being detained on the sea surface of Zhejiang, the Portuguese Zhengde Company's Libao ship operating on the Ningbo-Dinghai route has been driven into Wusongkou yesterday and anchored at the No. 18 pontoon in Yangshupu, where the previously detained Livorno ship is parked. The other detained ships are still outside Wusongkou. There are a total of four Japanese warships monitoring them. It is said that Libao's import was ordered by the Japanese Navy, but the ship's actions are still being monitored. The ship carried 300 passengers from Ningbo to Dinghai, who were forced to stay on the ship.

### Garrisoning of British Troops in Shanghai - Two Units, the East Yorkshire Regiment and the West Forli Highlanders, to Depart Soon

According to the Continental Daily News, information obtained from British military sources last night (the 8th) indicates that the British garrison in Shanghai will soon be reduced to only one large battalion. The East Yorkshire Regiment and the West Forli Highlanders will both be departing. They will be replaced by the 1st Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry, currently stationed in George, Scotland. The exact date of their arrival in Shanghai has not yet been announced.

### Missionary Dies Unexpectedly En Route from Sichuan to Shaanxi - Weapon Identified as an Automatic - Cause of Death Unconfirmed

Mr. Smel, a foreign inland missionary, died unexpectedly in a car on April 1st while traveling from Bao Ning (transliteration) in Sichuan to Shaanxi. According to news received from foreigners in this city on the evening of the 8th, Mr. Smel was traveling with his wife and a newborn baby several months old from Sichuan to Shaanxi to accompany his wife home when he was suddenly killed by an automatic weapon. It is still unconfirmed whether this was due to marital discord or premeditated murder.

### Japanese Consulate Notification of Invading Zhejiang Unconfirmed - Tranquility Prevails Throughout Eastern Zhejiang - Huang Shao-hong Optimistic About the War Situation - Chinese Troops Fully Defending Both Banks of the Grand Canal

Yesterday's report that the Japanese Consul had notified consuls from Germany, Italy, and other countries about an impending invasion of Eastern Zhejiang has been confirmed to be completely inaccurate. However, the Japanese side did notify the German and Italian consuls that, in order to protect the property of German and Italian nationals living along the Chinese coast, the two consuls should report on property along the Chinese coast, without specifying any coastal locations. Reporters from the New Voice News Agency also learned from shipping circles yesterday that, while Zhenhai in Eastern Zhejiang has restricted ships from entering and leaving, the gap in the blockade line has not yet been closed by the old Taiping steamer. The authorities have decided not to sink the ship unless absolutely necessary. Defensive works have been built and heavy troops stationed along the coast and rivers of Eastern Zhejiang. It will not be easy for Japanese troops to invade Eastern Zhejiang. At the same time, telegrams from various locations in Eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Quzhou, all stated that tranquility prevails as usual, and that various rumors circulating are completely unfounded.

Huang Shao-hong Discusses Eastern Zhejiang's Defense

Huang Shao-hong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has gone to the front lines of the defense area in Eastern Zhejiang to inspect and make detailed arrangements, waiting for an opportunity to launch a counterattack. It is reported that Mr. Huang recently told a foreign reporter that the military deployment in Eastern Zhejiang over the past year or more has created a strong resistance force in terms of defense. No matter where the Japanese troops come from, they will encounter huge sacrifices and waste their efforts. Large armies are stationed along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang and the south bank of the Qiantang River. The border between Zhejiang and Jiangxi is full of mountains and ridges. Once the war starts, it will not be able to end in a short amount of time. We should exhaust the last drop of blood and fight the enemy to the end. The people of Eastern Zhejiang have always been extremely fierce and warlike, a potential force that cannot be underestimated. If it breaks out in the future, the future is extremely optimistic.

Chinese Troops Control Grand Canal Transportation

The Grand Canal transportation within Jiangsu and Zhejiang is the only traffic route for connecting the voyage to North China. According to news from shipping circles, the Chinese troops on the eastern battlefield are now fully controlling it, so it is still impossible to use it today. At present, each section of Hangzhou-Huzhou, Hangzhou-Jiaxing, Jiaxing-Wujiang, Wujiang-Wuxi, and Wuxi-Zhenjiang are all blocked by our guerrillas. Incoming and outgoing ships can only sail outside the blockade line.

### Postal Bureau Ordered to Organize Military Postal Service - Military Mail Expedited - Regulations for Military Postal Communication and Savings Established

Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the Postal Bureau has been ordered to organize a military postal service to meet the needs of the war of resistance. Those that have been successively established include Jin-Shaanxi, Western Henan, E-Wan, Southern Jiangxi, Eastern Zhejiang, Hunan, and other places, to handle military communications with remarkable results. Now, because the second phase of the war of resistance has begun, a special military postal general inspection office has been set up in Guangdong and Guangxi, stipulating that all military mail shall be sent, distributed, and transferred according to expedited mail procedures. Officers and soldiers of the troops may purchase free money orders from post offices handling military mail for remittances of up to twenty yuan. However, the procedure for purchasing free money orders must be handled by military mail messengers designated by the troops to ensure confidentiality and convenience. In addition, regulations for military postal communication and savings have been established to solve the savings problems of soldiers on the battlefield.

### French Postal Ship "Général Joffre" Scheduled to Sail to Shanghai - Currently Under Repair in Hong Kong - Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on May 8th

According to the Continental Daily News, the French postal ship "Général Joffre," which recently collided with the British steamer "Guangzhou" near Hong Kong, will sail to Shanghai on May 8th. Although the ship sailed into Hong Kong on its own after the collision, it was severely damaged and is now under repair in Hong Kong. Its arrival in Shanghai is to replace the "Félix Roussel," which sailed from Marseille and recently arrived in Saigon, where it is said to be weeping over France. After the "Général Joffre" arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong on May 8th, it will sail to Marseille the next day.

### British Soldier from the East Yorkshire Regiment Suddenly Disappears - Authorities of Both Concessions Investigating

British soldier Carter from the East Yorkshire Regiment stationed in Shanghai suddenly disappeared on the evening of last Thursday. Although personnel from the police departments of the British and French concessions and the British military command have made great efforts to investigate and research the cause of the disappearance for many days, there is still no news. Carter is 21 years old. On Thursday of last week, he was still wearing a blue uniform, and his companions saw him. His sudden disappearance in the middle of the night is suspicious.

### New Regulations on Transit and Residence Permits Promulgated by the Vietnamese Government - Visas and Passports Valid for Fifteen Days - Our Consul in Hanoi Requests Amendments

After the war, Vietnam became an important route for entering and exiting the Southwest. Various foreign shipping companies have increased the number of ships sailing on the Haiphong route. Two new regulations on transit and residence visas have now been promulgated by the local government in Vietnam:

(1) Those holding passports with transit visas issued by the French consulate can reside in Vietnam for 15 days. If the visa expires, they must pay an additional 7.5 Vietnamese currency in order to temporarily reside for 30 days from the date of arrival. Those residing for more than one month must pay head tax, otherwise

Otherwise, they will be fined: males 30 yuan, females 3 yuan. Due to this regulation, recently

Chinese people going to Vietnam

Those holding transit visa passports are more convenient than those holding entry visa passports, so as not to be fined for not reporting after 48 hours. If a person holding a transit visa intends to reside in Vietnam for more than 15 days, but not more than one month, he may request the French consulate where he is located to issue an entry visa, but at the same time, it must be noted "non-resident," so as not to be treated as an immigrant by the local government.

treatment. The visa office of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Hong Kong has forwarded a notice to those who obtained passports there to apply for a transit visa from the French consulate. If the passport holder resides in Haiphong, he can also apply for a transit visa after arriving there, so as to avoid the restrictions on immigrants and reduce the risk of punishment. At the same time, the consul of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Hanoi requested the Governor of Vietnam to amend the above regulations.

### Overseas Chinese in Siam Facing Harsh Treatment - Siamese Government Damaging Friendly Relations - Authorities Decide to Negotiate

Since the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Siamese government has not only increased the amount of entry tax and restricted Chinese people from going there, but also promulgated various harsh regulations in the country, making it impossible for our overseas Chinese to live in peace in business. For example, trade, education, residence, etc. are often interfered with. As a result, overseas Chinese from Fujian, Guangdong, and other places in Siam have been packing up and returning to China due to unbearable oppression. Ships from Siam to Hong Kong and Guangdong are carrying these overseas Chinese. The Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce has reported the inability of overseas Chinese in Siam to live and work in peace and various harsh treatments to the government for verification. Now the government, in addition to ordering local authorities to properly settle the returning overseas Chinese, will also conduct strict negotiations to correct this situation of damaging friendly relations with the Siamese government.

### Shanghai Dock Workers' Union Sends Telegram Requesting the Arrest of Wang Jingwei - Betraying the Nation Arouses Divine and Human Wrath - Swiftly Arrest and Bring to Justice to Rectify Party Discipline

Since Wang Jingwei's traitorous behavior was exposed, the people of the whole country have been unanimously outraged and have sent telegrams to the Central Government requesting arrest and legal punishment. The dock workers' union in this city also telegraphed yesterday requesting arrest and punishment. The original text reads, "To the esteemed Chiang Kai-shek, Director-General of the Central Party Headquarters in Chongqing, Chen Li-fu, Minister of Social Affairs, and all members of the committee: Before Zhao Ming lightly uttered absurd remarks, the Central Government was lenient and did not pursue the matter. Recently, he has become even more intense, betraying the Party and the country, selling out the nation, and leading the enemy to attack China. Divine and human wrath is aroused, and heaven and earth are intolerant. All workers in this union are clenching their fists, gnashing their teeth, and vowing not to coexist with him. Please swiftly issue an arrest warrant to rectify party discipline and please the people. Shanghai Special City Dock Workers' Union bows in respect."

### Four Warehouses of an American Company - Japanese and Puppets Attempt to Occupy - William Hunt & Company Decides to Negotiate According to Law

After the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sold all of its real estate to the American William Hunt & Company before the war, except for the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession, which was converted into the Roosevelt Wharf, there were also four locations, including the Pudong New Warehouse, China Warehouse, Hongkou Central Warehouse, and North Warehouse. After the war, they were occupied by the Japanese army. After repeated negotiations, they have not been returned to the company. Recently, the Japanese military authorities withdrew their troops from the Pudong New and China Warehouses and handed them over to the Japanese Nisshin Company for management, hoping to reorganize and resume business. The Hongkou Central and North Warehouses are still storing military ammunition and supplies, and are under military management. The puppet "Reform Government" recently disregarded the American company's property rights and attempted to seize all the property of these four warehouses and wharves from the Japanese. The Japanese Nisshin Company refused to allow the puppet government to interfere, leading to a conflict of interest between the Japanese and puppets. Before this dispute is resolved, the Pudong New and China Warehouses occupied by the Nisshin Company have also temporarily suspended reorganization and only sent a few employees to guard them, without any activity. It is reported that William Hunt & Company believes that this legal sale between China and the United States has been legally confirmed by the American Consular Court and will again rely on international law to request the American embassy and consulates to negotiate with the Japanese side and set a date to recover the property rights of the four warehouses.

### Suzhou Puppet Government Celebrates Anniversary - Suddenly Attacked by Chinese Troops - Burning Down Arches and Firing Warning Shots - Chinese Troops Capture Xiaotang Village, Shejiahang

According to visitors from Suzhou, the puppet "county government" and various puppets in Suzhou held a "celebration" on the 28th of last month for the "anniversary of the establishment of the puppet 'Reform Government'." They built arches at the intersection of Chayuanchang and Guanqian Street. The cost of the arches, decorated with hundreds of electric torches, was forcibly borne by the people by the puppet organizations, which also forced ignorant residents to participate. Japanese troops and puppet police were responsible for security. Captain Liu of the independent brigade of a certain army stationed in a certain place heard the news and immediately sent many plainclothes team members to infiltrate the urban area. Taking the opportunity, they set fire to the arches and fired several warning shots. The order was disrupted for a time, and the puppet police looked at each other in dismay. After completing their mission, the team members left quietly in the chaos. The general public applauded and cheered.

Attacking Cars - Recently, the Central Military Authorities have equipped various war zones and launched a general counter-offensive. In order to cooperate with the military operations in the front and contain the Japanese troops in the rear, the Chinese troops in various guerrilla zones are also active everywhere, targeting railways and highways at important transportation hubs. According to a person from Kunshan, who spoke to the Modern News Agency yesterday, two Japanese Daizhi cars, fully loaded with gauze, driving from Shanghai to Qingpu, Kunshan, and Suzhou, were ambushed by more than 40 Chinese troops lying in ambush near Kunshan on the 8th of last month. The Chinese troops jumped out from both sides of the highway and ordered them to stop. Seeing that the situation was not good, the drivers tried to escape at full speed, but were shot by the Chinese troops with machine guns. The car bodies were riddled with holes. The Japanese guards could not resist and were captured. All the cargo, except for the portable ones, was taken away. The cloth and other items in their original boxes were too bulky to be carried away easily, so they were all burned.

Recapturing Xiaotang - The Nakajima unit of the Japanese army, which had been entrenched in Xiaotang, Fengxian County, was besieged by the guerrillas led by Ding Xueshan for days. The fighting was fierce, and the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The remaining enemy could not hold out and suddenly broke through and retreated last night (the 8th). The Japanese army suffered heavy losses after several days of siege. The town was recaptured by the guerrillas.

Puppet Army Suffers a Miserable Defeat - In the Fengnanchuan area of Pudong, the puppet troops of Zhang Miaogen and Xu Hongfa have been harassing more and more intensely. The Chinese guerrillas were ordered to suppress them and have repeatedly won victories. The Chinese troops on the evening of the 8th were the Second Company Commander Chen Musen and the Guard Battalion Commander Wu Ding and other subordinates of Commander Chen Yi of the Sixth Detachment of the Fifth Column of the Jiangzhe Border Guerrilla. The puppet troops were all mixed teams. The Chinese troops advanced from Yujiaqiao on the evening of the same day and engaged in a fierce battle with the puppet troops there for three hours. The gunfire was very intense. Later, the puppet troops suffered more than half casualties and fought to Zhoupu for help. The Chinese troops, having achieved their mission, retreated safely that night.

Capture of Dujiahang - According to a person from Pudong, the Third Regiment of Infantry of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force recently arrived in Pudong from a certain place, with a total of about 5,000 troops, with strong equipment and strict military appearance. The vanguard has reached a certain place and has exchanged fire with the Japanese army more than a dozen times. It is now heard that the army engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army in Dujiahang Town, Pudong at about 5 pm on the 7th of last month. The Chinese troops were personally commanded by Regiment Commander Xu Xingzhou and Regiment Adjutant Tao Xisheng. The fighting lasted for two hours. The Japanese army could not hold out and withdrew. The town was captured by the Chinese troops. In this battle, more than 30 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and the Chinese troops captured four machine guns. The Chinese troops suffered only five injuries and three boatmen.

### Sailing Ship "American Legion" Straight to San Francisco - A Grand Feat - American Authorities Do Not Allow Americans to Charter Sailing Ships - The Ship is the Last to Fly the American Flag

According to the Continental Daily News, American Anderson chartered a Ningbo sailing ship from Mo Tiemou of the China-America Bookstore Company, named it "American Legion," and set off on Friday with his wife, two foreigners, and three Chinese boatmen, intending to sail directly to San Francisco across the Pacific Ocean, which would take about 70 days. They had originally planned to set sail on Thursday, but the departure was delayed due to the issuance of a quarantine certificate and only took place the next day. The US State Department has recently ordered the US Consulate General in this city not to allow Americans to charter sailing ships, but Mr. Anderson chartered the "American Legion" two days before receiving the instruction in Shanghai, so the ship is the last sailing ship flying the American flag to set sail from Shanghai.

### Heard That Mr. Wen Lanting Stated That the Exchange Has Not Been Ordered to Resume Business, and Resumption of Business in the Special Circumstances of Shanghai is Factually Prohibited

The Shanghai Securities, Cloth, Flour, Grain, Gold, and other five exchanges stopped opening auctions after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. Although the exchange authorities have been preparing to resume, they have always been prohibited by the environment in the special circumstances. The current dark markets for securities and grains have nothing to do with the exchange authorities. They are dark market transactions by brokers and are limited to spot goods only, without futures. Previously, someone attempted to establish a joint exchange in the name of a foreign company, but was investigated and banned by orders from the Ministries of Finance and Economy, which led to the suspension of preparations. Today's report that each exchange was ordered by the Ministry to prepare for resumption, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially visited each exchange director yesterday. (1) According to Wen Lanting, director of the Cloth Exchange, the office did not receive an order from the Ministry to prepare for resumption. According to the current situation in Shanghai, resumption is factually impossible. (2) According to Chen Zi, director of the Grain Exchange, the office did not receive an order from the Ministry to prepare for resumption. Moreover, the office held a board meeting a few days ago and planned to rent out the office. (3) According to news from the Flour Exchange, the location of the office has been designated as a refugee area in Nanshi. The board of directors has not made any preparations for resumption. The Securities Exchange has denied the claim that it is preparing to resume and restore the formal seven-shot auctions. According to the above, it confirms that the claim that the exchanges were ordered to resume opening auctions is absolutely inaccurate. According to Xin Xin News Agency, in the current environment in Shanghai, even if the exchanges hope to resume business, it is factually impossible. For example, cotton yarn has been controlled by the Japanese and puppets. If the exchange resumes business and opens futures trading, what will be used to deliver the goods if obstruction is encountered at that time? Resuming business is no different from being used by others. For example, in securities trading, if it is stipulated that the market price must not be lower than 70%, it will inevitably lead to a dumping trend when compared with the current dark market price, which will cause social and financial instability. Therefore, it is factually absolutely impossible.

### Zhejiang Mail Forwarded from Wenzhou - Parcels Above Jinhua Suspended

The Shanghai Postal Administration previously stipulated that all mail from Shanghai to counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Shao, Yuyao, Ningbo, and cities and counties along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, such as Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Jinhua, and Nanchang, whether registered, express, or regular mail, would be forwarded from Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Haimen. Now that shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been interrupted and traffic is obstructed, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the transportation section of the bureau yesterday that all mail to counties in eastern Zhejiang will be forwarded from Wenzhou (Yongjia) in the future. Therefore, the delivery time may be extended due to the concentration of mail in one place. It is also heard that Xuan'an, Guaitou, Pingyang, Lishui, Lanxi, Yin County, Haimen, and other places are also forwarded from Wenzhou. As for various parcels in eastern Zhejiang, the large parcels were completely suspended before, but now Wenzhou has already resumed, and other small parcels are still accessible. However, all counties and cities above Jinhua have successively suspended both large and small parcels due to traffic congestion. Below Jinhua, the limit is only 5 kilograms.

Shanghai and Southwest Mail - According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Post Office learned that Shanghai's mail to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and various places in Xiang and Guangxi can still reach Dongxiang on the eastern section due to the loss of Nanchang. Above Dongxiang, although there is a highway that can detour to Ji'an, cross Nanchang, and connect with the western section of Zhangshu, there are many obstacles due to military relations, demolition of road rails, and congestion of highway and military transportation.

Postal Route Adopted - The Postal Bureau has changed its mail delivery to the Southwest to Shantou, via Qujiang, and to Hengyang, so mail delivery between Shanghai and the Southwest is still smooth. However, it is still limited to light items only, and it is difficult to restore parcels and heavy items for a while.

### The 37th Branch of the Citizens' Association Holds a General Meeting of Members

The 37th Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association held a general meeting of all members at the Songzi'an Assembly Hall at 2 pm yesterday. More than 100 members attended. The meeting was chaired by Chen Baode. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, and then Sun Wen'an, the representative of the tenants on North Fujian Road, reported on the negotiation with the Lao Gongmao Foreign Company to resolve the rent increase. The general meeting of members unanimously agreed. As the weather is about to turn warm, in order to prevent summer diseases and facilitate the treatment of citizens in the area, the meeting also decided to authorize the executive committee to organize summer clinics and medicine distribution, and to seek sponsorship from the medical and pharmaceutical communities. In addition, it was resolved to continue soliciting new members to participate, concentrate strength, and promote various welfare undertakings.

Sexual Health

### Exploring the Pros and Cons of Celibacy and Sexual Moderation from a Health Perspective

— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Currently, among scholars discussing the issue of celibacy and sexual moderation, there are approximately two factions: one faction believes that good health never relies on sexual activity as a condition. There are many disputes and no consensus. The purpose of sexual desire is for reproduction, for reproductive rather than physiological action, which is recognized by everyone. Ejaculation is also specifically for the purpose of conception and is by no means for entertainment between men and women. If people can preserve essence and protect yang, and not let it leak out, then the several types of excitatory and active secretions contained in the essence can be transformed into the body's needs. If ejaculation is not for the purpose of conception, it is simply depleting oneself and destroying oneself. If you look at major athletes or speakers, they must abstain from sexual activity when holding major sports or speeches, and live a simple life in order to obtain the greatest efficiency in terms of physical and intellectual strength. Therefore, the latter's claim is recognized by more people.

Speaking of the impact of sexual desire on our daily lives, there are two major issues that must be studied: (1) Is sexual desire necessary for physiology? The general view is that sexual desire is as indispensable to life as hunger for food and sleepiness for sleep, which is a big mistake. Sexual desire is only active in a certain period of life; before and after this, there is no activity of sexual desire, but it does not hinder the individual's health. (2) Does sexual desire vary from person to person? Eating and sleeping are the instincts of a newborn. However, it is not the same for people's sexuality. For example, there are people who lack emotion. They have no love for the opposite sex, so they have no need for sexual intercourse. There are also so-called romantic youths, who are either born with it or indulged in nature, burning in the fire of lust and acting recklessly. Furthermore, what A sees as sexual beauty may not be strange to B and may be hateful to C. If we look at the different sexual desires of each person, it is clear that sexual desire is not a need of the body.

Since sexual desire is not as indispensable to daily life as appetite, in order to maintain physical and mental health, we should not indulge in lust. However, since we know that sexual desire is necessary for our reproduction, we should quickly cure the problems caused by indulgence, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, and irregular menstruation. According to this doctor's experience, the treatment for the above symptoms is to increase essence and tonify the kidneys. For example, the German Xiongzhuang animal pill essence preparation for men, "Buti Kang," not only produces essence and tonifies the kidneys, but also calms the nerves and prevents excitement. Long-term use has the effect of reversing aging. Therefore, many stubborn premature ejaculation, impotence, and underdevelopment have been effectively treated with continuous use. The female "Buti Kang" is a good medicine for regulating essence and seeds. It has long been proven clinically.

### Young People Should Be Healthy, Happy, and Pure

— Zheng Ting, German Doctor of Medicine

Young people should be healthy, happy, and pure, which is what everyone wants. However, during the development period, there are many people who are influenced by bad environments or induced by obscene reading materials to develop the so-called bad habit of masturbation.

In terms of the impact of masturbation on health, it is already difficult to estimate. What's more, it leads to the subsequent degradation of personality and moral decline. People who have masturbated for too long often have dull eyes, dark circles around their eyes, cold hands, and staggering steps. They suffer from nocturnal emission every day, toss and turn in bed and cannot sleep, and yawn frequently in the morning. At this point, it can be said that they have reached a worrying stage.

Masturbation and nocturnal emission are inseparable symptoms. After masturbation damages the essence gate, the essence gate loses its control and becomes hypersensitive. A slight stimulation will cause leakage. Over time, neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, underdevelopment, and other symptoms will occur. The treatment should be strictly maintained, abstain from masturbation, and take German-made "Nice Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop it. If you supplement it with the German male "Buti Kang," a puberty gland tonic, it will be easier to restore health.

### How to Have Confidence in Treating Gonorrhea

— Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine

The treatment of ever-changing gonorrhea lies in having a central grasp, so that you can deal with it with ease. But how to have confidence in treating gonorrhea? This question has now been resolved. Because countries around the world are now frantically researching methods to eliminate gonorrhea, as a result, the German master of gonorrhea, Dr. Peter, invented the special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinnong," which is used by doctors in various countries around the world. The following is a summary of the clinical experiments of gonorrhea experts from various countries around the world:

Dr. Liverpool from the United States said: One evening, a patient with acute gonorrhea came, whose pain was very severe, with pus and blood flowing, and his spirit was greatly hit. When asked if he had been treated for this disease? He replied that he had taken sandalwood oil and chemical therapy drugs on the market, but he still could not get a fundamental solution after taking them. I used various scientific methods to check and found that the gonorrhea had reversed into the posterior urethra, so the inflammation of the posterior urethra was very fierce and terrifying. I told him to stop these bad treatments and change to using the "Kelinnong" invented by Dr. Peter from Germany. After a week, all the inflammation completely subsided, and it was completely cured after eight days. The doctor once said to the patient that inferior drugs on the market are actually harmful and not beneficial to gonorrhea. Taking drugs recommended by doctors such as "Kelinnong" can cure gonorrhea fundamentally, quickly, and safely.

Dr. Adi Mai of Switzerland also has the most abundant experience with "Kelinnong." According to him, I once used the drug "Kelinnong" to cure an old gonorrhea patient who had suffered from it for six or seven years. The patient had traveled to various countries and major cities, and had been treated by countless famous doctors, but the condition was always difficult to solve fundamentally. I asked if I had the confidence to cure this disease fundamentally. I smiled and said that if you have the determination to cure gonorrhea, I can be fundamentally responsible for curing it. The patient followed my words. After examination and diagnosis, I found that he had developed gonococcal arthritis. I told him to take the special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinnong" to make its anti-gonorrhea sterilization effect fill the joints and blood. As a result, this difficult gonorrhea was completely and fundamentally cured in five weeks, restoring his healthy body. "Kelinnong" is better than any chemical preparation.

### Tuberculosis Treatment Case

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Patient Feng Yongde, with a weak constitution. He suffered from hemoptysis at the age of twenty. He recovered after resting for several months. Later, due to excessive use of the brain, it occurred again last summer, with chest tightness and gasping. He coughed up blood phlegm. He had a slight fever of 37.7 degrees in the evening. His body became thinner and haggard. He had difficulty sleeping at night. He had many dreams and palpitations, and night sweats. He felt dizzy and mentally tired when he got up in the morning. After X-ray examination, there were small holes the size of silver corners in the lungs. Tuberculosis had reached the third stage. He was told to take the German "Bufei Naer" internally. After taking less than two bottles, the night sweats and fever were gone, and the condition improved greatly. So he continued to take it continuously for three weeks, and at the same time, he was asked to stay absolutely quiet at home and eat more nutritious foods. Coughing, gasping, hemoptysis, and other symptoms were completely cured, and his appetite increased greatly, and his weight increased. He changed into a beautiful and healthy man.

### Standard Therapy for Arthritis

Wandering like a bandit, gonorrhea has the nature of mercury, escaping and digging, it really is everywhere, and its whereabouts are erratic, and is similar to bandits, so the question is how to completely capture and eliminate gonorrhea. The achievement of such a goal cannot be achieved by general membrane-penetrating sterilization and ordinary chemical therapy, because these therapies only show a temporary effect on the surface, and cannot fundamentally eliminate gonorrhea deep in the tissue, because as long as there is a gonorrhea in our body, the effect of sterilization will inevitably be abandoned, so the focus of the current problem is how to eliminate gonorrhea in one fell swoop, so as to achieve a fundamental cure. It seems that general local therapy for arthritis, which is most widely found in latent bacteria, is almost absolutely impossible to succeed, such as membrane-penetrating sterilization, chemical therapy, etc.

Anti-gonorrhea therapy Due to the above reasons, a new anti-gonorrhea therapy has to be used to radically treat gonococcal arthritis, and the only oral medicine that can competently and pleasantly surprise the world is "Kelinnong." With 20 years of experience, every new drug that comes out every year has been tested almost all over, and I have always trusted the drug "Kelinnong," because it has the effect of increasing self-preservation of gonorrhea, surrounding the lesions, and there is no disadvantage of missing a gonorrhea. I use German lymph消, and static electricity method. X-ray radiotherapy, and phase for use, only "Kelinnong" sterilization effect, , then it belongs to arthritis from and by, I always use these therapies, to radical cure, this can be called the standard gonorrhea method. From the date of record, 10,000,020. , period only , number gold 5 jiao.

### Anle Textile Factory Purchases Japanese Yarn, Dispute Arises Over Delivery, Anle Factory Attempts to Deny Goods, Heng'an Yarn Company Wins Lawsuit

Since August 13th, textile factories in this city have been purchasing Japanese yarn to make goods due to the shortage of domestic cotton yarn and soaring prices, and then claiming to be domestic goods because they are woven by Chinese merchant factories. This kind of impure and superficially domestic goods are now everywhere in the market, and almost all old cotton yarn businesses sell Eastern goods. However, in recent years, when both buyers and sellers encounter Eastern goods in transactions, they mostly use cash transactions as a principle, without leaving any traces between acceptance and delivery, so as to avoid criticism. Although this is

A strategy to prevent accusations

However, there are many disputes between buyers and sellers due to incomplete transaction procedures. For example, the case between Anle Textile Factory and Heng'an Yarn Company in Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, is an example of this kind of dispute. Anle started purchasing yarn from Heng'an last spring, and the transaction was very large. Every decision was made to pay in cash, and there were no disputes at first. Until June 27th and 30th, Anle ordered a total of 25 pieces of Hongxi brand, Dahong brand, and Lima brand 20s and 16s simple yarn. At the same time, they ordered 100 pieces of 20s futures yarn for July. After Heng'an delivered the 25 pieces of spot goods, Anle

One hundred pieces of futures yarn

At first, they asked for a cancellation, but seeing the yarn price soaring, they suddenly sent a letter urging delivery. Heng'an refused strictly because they were inconsistent. Anle, seeing that there was no way to take advantage, took advantage of the gap between the previous batch of spot transactions, and took the opportunity of not giving the delivery receipt for the goods, and re-ordered 25 pieces of tube yarn from Heng'an. Dai Ren'an, the manager of Heng'an, thought that Anle Textile Factory was a leader in the weaving industry in this city, so how could it come up with the idea of spending one batch of money to cut two batches of goods? After reasoning with Deng Zhonghe and Zhang Houqin, the factory owners, Deng and others insisted that Heng'an disregarded credit and

Attempted to deny goods

They then hired lawyer Song Qiwen to file a complaint against Heng'an Yarn Company and its manager Dai Ren'an in the First Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering the delivery of 15 pieces of 20s tube yarn and 10 pieces of 16s tube yarn purchased. Although the defendant asked its employee Shen Shende to appear in court during the trial to prove that the yarn had been delivered to the plaintiff's own car by him together with Xin Jing, Ri Xin (both Japanese merchants), Liang Yang Bank, and An Shen Yang Bank, because it was a cash transaction, there was no receipt for the goods. The staff of Xin Jing and other warehouses also testified to the

Fact of delivery

However, the judge in the first instance ultimately determined that the defendant could not provide strong evidence that the yarn had been delivered to the plaintiff, and that the statements of the witnesses were also very different, so the defendant's claims were difficult to believe. The judgment was that the defendant should deliver 15 pieces of 20s tube yarn and 10 pieces of 16s tube yarn to the plaintiff, and the litigation costs should be borne by the defendant. Heng'an refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Zhang Yiping to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, explaining the reasons for dissatisfaction. He said that the 25 pieces of Lima brand tube yarn purchased by Anle were all delivered on the day of payment, and there were detailed records in the ledger and other account books, which

Record Mingzhe

Could be used as proof. The original trial did not adopt this very important documentary evidence. At that time, the appellant requested the appellee to submit the purchase book, which could immediately reveal the truth. However, what they submitted was only a general ledger of raw materials to perfunctorily deal with the matter. They also listed the facts that the warehouse staff saw when the goods were shipped, and requested to summon them to testify. Finally, they requested that the original judgment be abolished and the appellee's first instance claim be rejected, and that the appellee be ordered to bear the litigation costs of both instances in order to show fairness. After the Second Branch of the Higher Court opened a collegial panel to summon both parties and witnesses for examination and inquiry, and concluded, it issued the main text of the judgment the day before yesterday, stating that the original judgment was abolished, the appellee's first instance claim was rejected, and the litigation costs of both instances were borne by the appellee.

### Japanese Driver Causes Accident and Flees, Detained and Re-Examined After Investigation

Motorist Huang Asi, resident of No. 66 Huanlong Road, French Concession, was driving a No. 6852 self-provided car owned by Japanese Yokota at 7:40 pm on the first of this month, and was driving east on Fuxu Road, Shandong, at high speed, when a British woman, Mullte Gai (phonetic transcription, 36 years old), residing at No. 363 Fuxu Road, crossed Fuxu Road from north to south. Because she could not avoid it in time, she was hit and knocked to the ground. Motorist Huang Asi drove away quickly after the accident. A passerby, Jiang Dingyuan, Fang Jinming, caught a glimpse of the car's license plate number and reported it to the patrolmen, who reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate and summon Huang Asi. He admitted to causing the accident. The police station sent Huang to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. The lawyer of the French Concession administrative authority filed a lawsuit according to Article 64, Paragraph 2 of the Public Works Bureau Traffic Regulations. The victim also appeared in court to testify about the injuries she suffered in the collision. When Huang Asi was questioned, he still firmly denied it. The judge reviewed the confession and ordered a re-examination after further investigation.

### Iron Wire Mesh Blocking Road in Front of a Mansion on Haig Road, Cutting Off Traffic with Concession, Rumor Has It That a Big Gambling Den Will Be Opened

According to the Mainland News, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Works Department, under the direction of the police department personnel, erected barbed wire fences around the Chinese residence at No. 428 Haig Road, bordering the Public Concession, starting in the morning (8th). It is rumored that the residence was once the residence of Li Guojie, and now someone intends to use it to open a large gambling den in the near future. Yesterday, the authorities did not admit this statement, but all circles other than the police department have confirmed that this is undoubtedly the reason for the police department's action. It is believed that the people currently residing in the residence are Japanese people, either Koreans or Taiwanese. When the patrolmen directed the erection of obstacles in front of the residence, several Koreans or Taiwanese sent women out of the cliff, while they themselves remained inside. It was learned yesterday that the barbed wire mesh was placed on the sidewalk outside the wall of the house along Haig Road. The police department had been preparing to erect it a few days ago. At that time, the Japanese authorities had consulted with the police authorities, but broke down. The police department then placed obstacles in the area under its jurisdiction.

Qiao Ben, the Nanqu district leader of the Japanese special service agency on Pudong Jianchang Road, recently hired over thirty gangsters and dispatched them to various ferry crossings to investigate the activities of guerrillas, calling them "secret agent teams." Each person receives thirty yuan per month, wears Western-style clothing, and carries a box gun or pistol at their waist, running rampant on the streets. Because they do not recognize the guerrillas at all, they cannot make arrests and have no achievements. Instead, they indiscriminately arrest civilians at various ferry crossings, and the number of victims is countless, so there is a lament of "difficult to travel" along the Pudong coastline.

### Zhou Xu Baozhen Sues the First Wife to Hand Over Estate Account Books. Defendant Claims Plaintiff Has No Family or Inheritance Rights. Court Orders Postponement Pending Testimony from Witnesses.

Zhou Weng, a widow from Zhenze, formerly residing at Number 7, Liansheng Lane, Yuyuan Road, and her late husband, Zhou Junyu, served in the Public Security Bureau and tax authorities, accumulating hundreds of thousands of assets. Zhou's concubine, Xu Baozhen, and her son, Jiateng (twelve years old), and daughter, Baoshi (six years old), recently engaged lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Gengxiang to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special District, accusing the first wife, Zhou Weng (fifty-one years old), and her son, Jiahua (twenty-four years old), of wrongfully occupying the estate. They requested the court to order the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with reasonable living expenses and to turn over the complete

Estate Account Books

for calculation, so that the plaintiffs can receive their shares, divided into four parts for the three plaintiffs. Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned the parties for a hearing in the Second Civil Court yesterday, presided over by Guo Wei. The plaintiff, Zhou Xu Baozhen, stated that she was thirty-five years old, from Wujiang. In November of the tenth year of the Republic of China, she was introduced by Zhou Xutang and married Zhou Junyu as a concubine. After the marriage, they lived together in Zhenze (in the same house with the first wife) and had five children. Except for three who died young, there are still one son and one daughter (i.e., the second and third plaintiffs). In August of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, they

Moved to Suzhou

to Number 25, Wangxima Lane, to live in the house of lawyer Fan Chongguang. The husband paid for the children's education expenses himself and gave me fifty yuan per month for household expenses. Last September, he came to Shanghai with the first wife and lived at Number 7, Yiqing Lane, Avenyue Edward VII Road. When he left, he told me he would return to Suzhou in November. Unexpectedly, he passed away from illness in Shanghai on November 20th. The defendants, Zhou Weng, etc., did not even notify me. Because I am illiterate, a neighbor saw the obituary of the Zhou family in the newspaper and told me, and only then did I find out. I immediately brought my children from

Came to Attend the Funeral

The defendant mother and son refused to let the plaintiffs enter the door and completely seized the deceased husband's estate, disregarding the plaintiffs' livelihood. Helpless, I have no choice but to request the court to order the defendants to hand over the estate account books for calculation. Next, the defendant's attorney, Chen Huapeng, stated that the defendant, Zhou Weng, does not recognize the relationship between Xu Baozhen and the deceased husband as husband and concubine. However, they signed a separation agreement in September of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. They have lost their family and

Inheritance Status

and now have no right to order the defendant to turn over the accounts. Please reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. The court then questioned the plaintiff, Xu Baozhen, who testified that I never severed the relationship with Zhou Junyu. The defendant's evidence of separation does not have my signature. Now, I will concede a point. Even if there was a separation, please see that the house I live in was rented by Zhou Junyu and lawyer Fan, with Zhou Junyu's own

Signature and Seal

The guarantor is Shi Mingsong, and the rental agreement was written by Fan's lawyer's son. The living expenses of fifty yuan per month are also evidenced by a receipt. If I had separated in the twenty-second year and until last September, would he still be willing to rent a house for me and bear the living expenses of my mother and children? After reviewing the testimonies, the court ordered that the case be postponed, pending the testimony of the witnesses.

### Various Places in Nanshi Are Actually Carrying Out Anti-Foreign Propaganda, Words are Nonsensical, Not Worth a Laugh

### "Expand the Anti-Aggression Organization"

— Maolie

Even a lion uses its full strength to catch a rabbit. But what about Britain, the leader of the democratic countries, who is like a lion? Towards the fascist countries, who are like a pack of wolves and tigers, it only treats the symptom and not the cause, perfunctorily and tolerantly, allowing them to do whatever they want, causing endless harm? We have certainly heard loud roars; however, the actions after the roars still make us have to express disappointment!

She, Britain, the leader of the democratic countries, the initiator of the anti-aggression organization, although intending to prevent the fascist countries from continuing aggression, only pays attention to Eastern Europe, and ignores Southern Europe, allowing Italy to take advantage of the gaps and overthrow Albania in one fell swoop; she also only pays attention to Europe, and ignores Asia. For example, when Labor Party members inquired about inviting China and other Far East countries to join the anti-aggression organization, there was no further news. It is conceivable that Chamberlain had no intention of this, or had no time for this, allowing our enemy, another aggressive fascist country, to remain at large, running rampant without restraint. And finally, and most importantly, she only invited the generally weak countries of Eastern Europe, but abandoned the Soviet Union, which was strong enough to independently resist the fascist countries, causing the Soviet Union to stand aloof, while the German-Italian axis still dominates Europe, leaving us helpless. Given all this, I always believe that the scope of the anti-aggression movement is too narrow, its momentum is lacking, and its strength is especially weak, insufficient to rally support, establish prestige, and even more insufficient to influence and deter the aggression of the fascist countries. If this continues, I can say that the annexation of the weak in Europe will inevitably happen again, and the hegemony of the British Empire will also be shaken one day!

For the present, the best thing to do is to be able to organize a global anti-aggression alliance, because in this way, we can deal with the axis of the three powers as a whole; second, at least in Southern Europe, bring in Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, etc., to form another group, and in Asia, invite Annam, Siam, the Philippines, the Dutch Indies, etc., to form another group, so that we can deal with them separately. Otherwise, the future of international relations is unimaginable.

Unfortunately, Britain does not seem to have such determination; not only Britain, but even Romania, which has already been threatened, is afraid of offending Germany and dare not get close to the Soviet Union. And Yugoslavia, whose danger has reached its doorstep, is even more afraid of offending Italy, and turns a blind eye to the destruction of its neighbor Albania, not daring to save it. One day, they will inevitably regret that it is too late!

### Country Folk

— Green Leaves

In the afternoon, two country folk, both in their twenties, each carrying a wicker basket, were walking one behind the other towards the edge of the small town gate. The one in front, upon seeing the yellow-uniformed guard, bowed to him as usual, placed the wicker basket on the ground, opened the lid, and let him inspect it.

There was only one guard in yellow. As always, he remained silent, put on a stern face, leaned down with one hand on his gun, and rummaged through the contents of the wicker basket, throwing them onto the ground impatiently.

The countryman behind began to do the same as the one in front: bowing slightly, placing the wicker basket on the ground, and opening the lid. However, the guard was inspecting the first wicker basket and did not notice the second one, as it was somewhat to his side and not easily visible.

Suddenly, the countryman behind took out a small, black object from the second wicker basket. While the guard was looking down, he aimed the opening of that small object at his temple and pulled the trigger. With a "crack" sound, the guard fell to the ground, blood gushing from both his temples.

The two country folk threw the wicker baskets on the ground and turned to flee.

The sound startled the other yellow-uniformed men in the Guan Di Temple inside the big town gate. Five or six of them hurried out to see what had happened. At a glance, they understood the situation. They left two people to attend to the person on the ground and chased after the two who fled out of the town. However, after crossing the drawbridge and turning two corners, they reached a crossroads and had no way to proceed, so they had to stop and hesitate.

Of course, they did not know that the men had already escaped from that street and could not pursue them down that street. Moreover, they knew very well that no matter which street they took, it would only be half a mile to the end, and beyond that was only fields and countryside. And the fields and countryside were precisely the forbidden territory they dared not easily venture into.

After asking the people on the street without any result, they muttered to each other for a while and had no choice but to return to the town.

At the edge of the small town gate, while they were collecting their companion who had died on the ground, they carefully inspected the things on the ground. Among the various torn clothes and scattered paper scraps, they found a letter. Opening it, they saw these words inside:

...Don't just stubbornly stay within the city walls! If you have the guts, come down to the countryside and let's see who's better on the battlefield! If you don't come down, we will come up.

Now, let us give you a taste of things to come!...

Below was the formal signature: Li Yilong, Captain of the ×× Unit of the ×× Army.

Everything was handed over to the city garrison headquarters, and the commander sent someone to find Guo Lao Er to discuss the matter.

Guo Lao Er was originally a local ruffian, despised by the villagers. Because of his meritorious service in welcoming the yellow-uniformed men, they sent him to work in the "police station." From then on, he gained power, wealth, and influence.

As soon as Guo Lao Er arrived, he said that this matter could not be easily let go, and at least a show of force should be made. After some discussion, they divided half of their men, about fifty or sixty, into a line and marched out of the city. When they reached the crossroads, regardless of left or right, they went straight ahead.

The street ended, but after two or three li, they arrived at a town. This was Guo Lao Er's hometown. When everyone saw Guo Lao Er walking at the head of a group of yellow-uniformed men, they involuntarily cast poisonous glances at him, secretly cursing: Shameless beast!

The yellow-uniformed men wanted to rest, and Guo Lao Er led them into the largest hotel, Huang Long Yuan. The owner, Huang Guansan, and his family hurriedly escaped through the back door, leaving only two elderly clerks to attend to them, carrying out two jugs of wine and inviting these foreign "honored guests" to drink.

In an instant, all the young men and women in the town had fled, leaving only the old and the young. Because they had received too many lessons, they already knew how to behave themselves.

It was already dusk and, of course, it was time to go back, and more importantly, they had to go back. So, with staggering steps, leading the drunken yellow-uniformed men, they walked out of Huang Long Yuan.

Guo Lao Er then made a suggestion to the leader, saying, "Going back like this would be a joke to the 'bandits.' We should give them a taste of our power." The leader listened to him and did these two things:

First, set a fire, starting with Huang Long Yuan. While burning, Guo Lao Er lectured his old neighbors:

—You are harboring "bandits," so you are being punished. If you do this again, we will kill every last one of you!

Second, Guo Lao Er wrote a barely legible note and posted it on a bridge pillar in the middle of the street, roughly saying:

...We have come down to the countryside, where have you all run off to! If you have the guts, come into the city!...

They returned safely to the town in the fading twilight, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Guo Lao Er was greatly rewarded by the commander, who said he was thorough and capable in his work, and immediately promoted him to "Police Chief."

Guo Lao Er's joy was imaginable.

The next morning, Guo Lao Er, according to his usual habit, went to the Yongchun Tea House on the west side of the "County Magistrate's Office" to drink tea and have breakfast. Because he was so happy, his face was even more beaming with joy. As soon as he sat down, he spoke to the waiter and the people sitting next to him, praising his master's "benevolent rule" and announcing his grand policies after taking office as "Police Chief."

While he was delivering his grand speech, a person walked in from outside. Seeing him, he bent down and said to him in a fervent tone:

—Police Chief Guo, there is someone outside who wants to ask you to do something, please come out and meet them.

Guo Lao Er looked at the person, who seemed to be a recognizable neighbor, but he couldn't remember the name.

—Can't you ask him to come in?

As he said this, his face looked a little displeased.

The person took another step forward and whispered in his ear:

—The person has confidential matters. If Police Chief Guo helps, there will be some gifts, so it is not convenient to talk here.

As soon as Guo Lao Er heard about the gifts, his face softened, and he stood up and followed the person out.

Sure enough, there was already a person waiting at the entrance of the tea house. As soon as he saw Guo Lao Er come out, he greeted him and raised one hand, saying:

—Sending Guo Ju back to heaven!

At the same time, with another "crack" sound from the raised hand, Guo Lao Er fell backward, a stream of blood flowing from between his eyebrows, covering his face and the ground.

The people in the tea house ran outside, running in all directions. The person who invited Guo Lao Er out and the person who raised his hand also ran among them. Before long, no one knew where they, these two people, had run to.

The "police" arrived and found another note on Guo Lao Er's chest, which read:

...We have come into the town, what can you do? If you have the guts, come down to the countryside and go further away!...

A series of closures of the town, door-to-door searches, made a great disturbance, turning things upside down, and in the end, it only caused trouble within the city walls, and moreover, "the wild goose flies into the dark sky, what does the archer admire!"

### Additional Notes

— Editor

Some contributors have apologized for not using manuscript paper with grids. This is not necessary. As long as the lines and columns are wide enough, that's fine. Moreover, this publication welcomes the use of Chinese paper. Letter paper and envelopes should also preferably be Chinese paper, and we should not blindly promote the sales of foreign paper.

We hope that every submitted manuscript includes a mailing address, because some manuscripts have attached postage stamps but no address, which makes it difficult for us. We hope there will be no more such cases in the future.

### Hypocrisy

— Run Gui

This is a puzzle, let it swirl in my mind!

When I cannot figure out what to answer, I comfort myself: human hypocrisy is inherited from the most distant ancestors, and should not have any effect, or purpose; so those who display this trait are simply too skilled at using their nature. Thus, I despise humanity, and of course, I despise myself!

In childhood, I occasionally discovered the deception and hypocrisy of relatives, but because I knew nothing at the time, I simply took it as a matter of course for elders, or a way of dealing with the world, so I didn't care at all. Turning my back, I let my thoughts drift to kicking a small ball or playing marbles. When I entered student life, I saw this kind of behavior more often: when classmates were caught cheating by the teachers, they would definitely insist that they hadn't cheated; they especially liked to boast and brag in front of the girls, although they themselves knew that the other party only treated their words as a breeze blowing past their ears. Later, when I got to society, I saw even more shocking cases of deception of all kinds, but my heart felt even more confused and lost, and I also despised humanity even more.

Human hypocrisy is always all kinds of ways: some use hypocrisy to try to deceive some benefits, some for a certain thing, have to be hypocritical, as if without hypocrisy, standing in society is only like having one leg, without a support, standing unstable, even if your talent is good, the skill is high, can only float in the ethereal, a careless, throw on the ground, made a full body of wounds. Conversely, if you can flexibly become hypocritical, at least you will not be a hungry poor wretch crying and begging people "do a good deed!" In a word: hypocrisy is teaching you how to live in the world, how to survive.

These words seem to be close to a believer in hypocrisy, but although I do not advocate this, some facts are in front of me, but I can not help but feel this way. Look, now in society, who wants to live, who wants to be prominent, who has to be hypocritical into who has to distort to use hypocrisy. So who has only always given people spurned contempt of the share!

The hypocrisy to become hypocrisy, it seems that this is not accidental.

### I Have a Brother on the Battlefield

— Li Ni

I have a brother on the battlefield,

He is usually so useless,

But when the flames of the Anti-Japanese War rose fiercely,

He ran away privately, without even leaving a letter,

But I consider it the supreme honor.

I have a brother on the battlefield,

He didn't take a car to the inland because he was poor,

He walked thousands of miles across thousands of mountains,

When he arrived at his destination, his heels were already swollen,

But I consider it the supreme honor.

I have a brother on the battlefield,

He works hard day and night, bearing heavy burdens,

He hasn't tasted rice and meat for three months,

But he wrote to me saying: comfort can only breed lazy bugs,

But I consider it the supreme honor.

I have a brother on the battlefield,

He started serving the people and finally resolutely joined the army,

He wants to swear to avenge his shame, and go straight to Huanglong,

He doesn't care about the hardships of military life,

But I consider it the supreme honor.

I have a brother on the battlefield,

I have seen him throw a seed of fire on the village,

I have been a dragon turning the mountains and overturning the seas by the side of Doyang Lake,

He is in hardship, but he never speaks of pain,

But I consider it the supreme honor.

I have a brother on the battlefield,

He is a young hero,

He has been missing since the Battle of Jiujiang,

From then on, perhaps, we will never see his face again,

But I consider it the supreme honor.

### The Current State of Social Education in Shanghai

— Yuan Chi

Social education, in its scope, is extremely broad. Shanghai, as China's largest city, boasting a population of over three million, has seen its social undertakings particularly developed to meet environmental needs. Besides government funding for initiatives, there are also numerous private endeavors. However, since the start of the War of Resistance, most of the government-sponsored programs have fallen into enemy-occupied zones. A small number of those not in occupied zones have also ceased operations due to the interruption of funding. To this day, what remains mostly consists of private initiatives, and their teaching targets are limited to citizens within the concessions, a stark contrast to the pre-war period. The following is an overview of the government-run programs that fell into Japanese hands or were suspended before the war:

1.  Public Education Center: The Municipal Public Education Center of this city was originally located on Wenmiao Road in South Shanghai. It was grand in scale, thriving in its operations, and achieving considerable success in various affiliated undertakings. It was truly the most complete and substantial implementing body for social education in the city. However, it fell into enemy-occupied territory after the outbreak of the war.

2.  Libraries: The Municipal Library system originally consisted of three branches: the Shanghai Municipal Library, located in the city center; a Municipal Library branch affiliated with the Public Education Center; and a circulating library in the Old City God Temple area. Among the three, the Municipal Library was the largest in scale and the newest in construction. After the war, it was either destroyed by fire or occupied by the Japanese army.

3.  Museum: Located in the city center, the building was magnificent, and the content was quite substantial. After the outbreak of the war, apart from a few precious items that were moved to safe locations, the rest were lost. Its palatial building was forcibly occupied by the puppet municipal government.

4.  Sports Fields: The largest in scale was the Shanghai Municipal Sports Field, whose grandeur was unparalleled in the Far East. In addition, there was the Municipal First Sports Field, located on Daji Road in South Shanghai, which was smaller in scale. The simple sports fields were scattered throughout the various townships, all of which were managed by local schools. After the war, they all fell. Some buildings of the Municipal Sports Field were even destroyed by artillery fire and have recently been occupied by the Japanese army as barracks.

5.  Zoo: Located on Wenmiao Road in South Shanghai, it was across from the Public Education Center. The various animals kept there, except for some that were relocated to Gujiazhai Park for public exhibition, were all casualties of the war.

6.  Botanical Garden: Located on Longhua Road in South Shanghai, it had been transferred to the Municipal Garden Farm before the war. Situated in a quiet and secluded location, the garden contained thousands of species of rare flowers and exotic plants, all of which fell into the hands of the Japanese army after the war.

7.  Public Reading Rooms: Scattered throughout the various townships of the municipality, there were no fewer than several hundred. Before the war, they were all managed by schools designated by the Social Affairs Bureau, either by posting the original newspapers or by adapting them into wall newspapers. After the war, they all disappeared with the closure of the schools.

8.  Literacy Schools: Shanghai began promoting large-scale literacy education in July of the 24th year [of the Republic, 1935], and by June of the 26th year [1937], six sessions had been held, each lasting six months. The implementation guidelines included two major parts: literacy education and civic education. The specific goals were to cultivate national morality, learn simple writing, impart general knowledge, improve the lives of the people, foster national consciousness, and train productive capacity. After two years of operation, significant results were achieved. A total of 317,526 people in the city had received literacy education. Even in the last session before the war, the sixth session, there were still 91 literacy schools with 368 classes, enrolling 22,262 students. According to surveys, as of before the war, only 309,334 illiterate people remained in the city. This was a reduction of more than half of the illiterate population compared to before the literacy education program. If given time, it would not have been difficult to completely eradicate illiteracy. However, since the start of the War of Resistance, this great undertaking has been suspended, which can be said to be the greatest loss in Shanghai's social education.

The above-mentioned social education undertakings were all managed by government agencies before the war, but have all been suspended after the war, with none remaining. In addition, there are some undertakings that were previously government-run, but a part of them have been able to relocate and resume operations. The existing social education undertakings are mostly private creations or new ventures after the war, which are also described below.

1.  People's Schools

Although People's Schools were government-run in the past and were scattered in the countryside, since the fall of Shanghai, some of the original teachers have recognized the importance of people's education and have relocated to the concessions to reopen schools. However, the number is much smaller than before, only about fourteen or fifteen. Funding is also extremely limited, so nominal fees for books and sundries are charged to supplement income. The implementation measures have also been standardized, and the main points are recorded below:

A. Purpose: To impart simple knowledge and skills to older, out-of-school people in accordance with the educational aims and implementation policies of the Republic of China.

B. School Facilities: The principle is to borrow from ordinary schools.

C. Students: Both male and female students are admitted, and boys and girls may be separated when necessary, but limited to those aged between sixteen and forty.

D. Duration: Each session lasts six months, with two hours of education per day.

E. Level: Divided into elementary and advanced levels. The elementary level is equivalent to the first grade of primary school, and the advanced level is equivalent to the third grade of primary school. Compound organization may be adopted.

F. Subject Breakdown: Chinese language: 66% of total time for elementary level, 50% for advanced level. Arithmetic: 12% of total time for elementary level, 10% for advanced level. Civic Training: 14% of total time for elementary level, 8% for advanced level. Music and Physical Education: 8% of total time for both elementary and advanced levels. General Knowledge and Simple Vocational Skills: Integrated into other subjects for the elementary level, and each accounts for 12% for the advanced level.

G. Teaching Materials: In addition to self-compiled materials, literacy readers, short-term primary school textbooks, Old and Young General Knowledge, and People's Readers published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation and the Commercial Press are used. Schools select materials from this range based on the students' level.

2.  Tutoring Schools

In the past year, tutoring schools in Shanghai, established by private individuals, have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, reaching more than 200 schools with about 60,000 students. The nature of each school can be broadly divided into general education and vocational education. General education focuses on supplementing language, mathematics, and general knowledge. Vocational education covers almost every department in the vocational sector. The reasons for the special development after the war are nothing more than three: first, the high desire for knowledge among low-level employees in the business community; second, ordinary school students, affected by the war, are unable to continue their studies and change their paths; and third, the general decline in private economic power, which makes it impossible to afford the cost of ordinary education for their children, so they send them to tutoring schools, hoping to acquire a skill in a short period of time to make a living. With these three reasons, tutoring schools have been able to flourish for a time, but in terms of quality, they may not yet be fully satisfactory.

3.  Street Children Education

Street children education is the latest product of adapting to environmental needs after the war. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai and its fall into an isolated island, refugees have gathered, and street children are everywhere. Enthusiastic educators recognized the need for relief, so they raised funds and organized the Shanghai Street Children Education Association to take charge of the operation. To date, 30 street children schools have been established, totaling 50 classes, educating more than 4,000 children. All educational activities are different from schools. Teaching materials are also formulated by the Street Children Education Association, and teachers compile them at any time. The teaching time is also based on the principle of catering to the convenience of street children. School buildings are completely borrowed from public places, temples, ancestral halls, and so on. However, school buildings or civilian houses are also borrowed when necessary. The implementation points of this new undertaking are recorded as follows:

A. Educational Purpose: To assist homeless out-of-school children aged six to fifteen, provide them with appropriate education, enable them to be physically and mentally healthy, and acquire basic knowledge and skills to adapt to real life.

B. Educational Methods: 1. Teaching aspects: meetings, grouping, visits, individual guidance, etc.

2.  Nurturing aspects: Provide medical treatment, assistance, and improvement of production methods, or introduce job opportunities, etc., in the daily life of street children.

C. Implementation Steps: 1. Register street children. 2. Guide teachers. 3. Contact educational venues. 4. Check physical fitness. 5. Stipulate educational time. 6. Send staff to counsel.

D. Teaching Schedule: 1. Teacher preparation. 2. Street children gather. 3. Cleanliness inspection. 4. Daily Meeting - singing street children's songs or reporting current affairs, common sense, and spiritual talks. 5. Special teaching activities for the whole class or in groups, such as Chinese, arithmetic, social design, and performances. 6. Singing, playing, and sports. 7. Group meetings - chaired by the group leaders to discuss group affairs.

4.  Refugee Education

As the name suggests, refugee education is also a new undertaking after the war. When the war broke out in Shanghai, refugees from the suburbs gathered in the concessions. Refugee camps were established one after another, and were separately managed by the International Relief Committee, the Joint Charity and Disaster Relief Association, the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee, the Refugee Relief Branch, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, and various clan associations and public organizations. At most, there were more than 220 refugee camps. The education methods were self-governed and lacked standards. Educational affairs were concurrently managed by the managers of each camp, and the methods were also different. After that, the main organizers recognized the importance of refugee education and successively set up guidance groups or education groups to preside over the education affairs of each camp under their jurisdiction, but they still only paid attention to the children's part. It was not until the International Committee of the Red Cross took on the responsibility of providing food and supplies to each camp that it established an education committee to uniformly preside over the refugee education in the city, and the career facilities were put on the right track. The refugees receiving education reached as many as 149,700 at most. As for the content of its implementation, refugee children aged six to sixteen receive children's education, divided into subjects such as Chinese, arithmetic, general knowledge, singing, and physical education. Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge are basic subjects and must be taught. Singing and physical education depend on the equipment, talent, and environment of each camp. The education time is at most 22 hours per week. Refugees over the age of sixteen receive adult education, divided into literacy, spiritual training, lectures, storytelling, movies, and calisthenics, with literacy education as the main focus and lectures and storytelling as supplements. The education time is at least 21 hours per week and at most 26 hours per week. Refugees with original living skills or more cleverness are given vocational education, divided into vocational training and production education. Vocational training teaches vocational knowledge and skills, and production education teaches various crafts production techniques. 22 kinds of craft production workshops have been opened, such as embroidery, sewing, carpentry, weaving, etc., and products are already on sale. If it can be persisted and promoted in spirit, it will not be difficult for consumers to change into producers.

5.  Lane Education

So-called lane education is actually equivalent to the past itinerant education, but its itinerant scope is based on lanes as the unit. Its implementation methods are very fluid. Any lane with many residents but no nearby schools is its teaching venue. School buildings are mostly borrowed from public places or spare houses of enthusiastic educators. The facilities are very simple. Except for those necessary for education, the rest are provided by the children themselves, and even tables and chairs are brought by the children. The content of education focuses on basic training, focusing on daily life knowledge and concepts and the inculcation of national consciousness. The recipients are mostly children, which seems to be classified into the scope of school education, but because the implementation methods are very different from school education, it is actually a kind of social education. The object of old social education was originally not limited to children. There are currently more than 430 people in the city receiving this lane education, divided into seven levels, scattered in seven places. When the number of out-of-school children in each place decreases, they are relocated to other lanes for education, which is also a product of adapting to the actual needs after the war.

6.  Newspaper Boys Education

Shanghai is a district where the newspaper industry converges. Thousands of children rely on selling newspapers for a living. These children shout out the important news published in various newspapers on the streets every day and run around everywhere. The influence on the public psychology is very great, and it is really necessary to give them strict training. Enthusiastic educators in this city have initiated the implementation of newspaper boys education. There are now ten newspaper boys schools, enrolling more than 400 students. In addition to giving newspaper boys daily life knowledge and language education, they pay special attention to the reporting of current affairs common sense, so that every newspaper boy can listen to the important news about current affairs every day. The teaching time is based on the principle of not hindering the children's newspaper selling time. School buildings use ordinary schools or other public places. They are currently raising funds and striving to expand.

7.  Public Sports

Public sports in Shanghai have always been developed. Before the war, the Social Affairs Bureau specially set up a public sports section to guide public sports in the city and organize amateur sports meets and walking competitions. Municipal sports fields trained the public in sports and spared no effort. The All-China Athletic Federation also hosted international sports competitions. After the War of Resistance, the above-mentioned institutions have all been suspended. However, the atmosphere of sports competitions is still booming. Except for track and field competitions, which are rarely held due to the lack of large venues, the practice and competitions of football, basketball, tennis, swimming, and other competitions are carried out as usual.

In addition to the above, there are various other social education undertakings, which are too numerous to mention. For example, after the municipal library was destroyed, private individuals set up the Dingxiang Circulating Library, the China Circulating Library, the Ding Library, and so on. In short, there are few public social education undertakings in Shanghai after the war, and many private ones, especially tutoring schools, which are the most developed. Some undertakings are jointly set up in one place, but they cannot be publicly opened to the outside world due to concession regulations, so it is not easy to conduct accurate investigations. The newly emerging social education undertakings are all needed by the wartime environment and have profound significance in the process of resisting Japan and building the country.

### The Work of Various Churches in Shanghai During the Extraordinary Period

— Deng Shuyuan

The history of the establishment of churches in Shanghai is already ninety years old. The first church was built at Zhengjia Muqiao. Ninety years later, today, the situation has changed greatly. The number of churches in Shanghai has reached more than seventy, of which fifty-seven churches belong to the orthodox sect, and the number of church members has reached 10,000.

The Shanghai Missionary Association is responsible for the liaison between the churches. The general headquarters for the publication, sale, and donation of the Bible is located at 158 Hong Kong Road, while the general publishing house for ordinary religious literature is located at Guangxuehui, 128 Bowuyuan Road. In addition, the church in Shanghai also has a radio station (call sign XMHD, frequency 760), which broadcasts for seven hours a day. In addition to sermons, the content also includes reports of religious news from around the world and at home, as well as music.

In August of the previous year [1937], the war in Shanghai broke out. Chinese Christian leaders in Shanghai, in view of the urgent need for relief work, initiated a luncheon party, inviting Chinese and foreign Christians in Shanghai to discuss the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees. At that time, the governments of Britain and the United States repeatedly decided to force expatriates to return home, but foreign Christians attending this luncheon were still unexpected, thus forming a united front of Christians. The organization of the Shanghai Christian Federation's relief undertaking was established at this time.

After the establishment of the Federation, it achieved remarkable results. After the start of the war in Shanghai, refugees were everywhere. The Federation immediately started fundraising and established 18 refugee camps, accommodating 150,000 refugees, and providing them with clothing, food, and shelter for seven months. After the refugees found a livelihood, they left the camp on their own. Finally, there were only more than 2,200 refugees left, gathered at the 18th Refugee Camp, located at Changping Road, Hedde Road. There are now 400 people left, but at this time the nature is different from before. Most of the refugees are self-sufficient, and the Federation gives them considerable subsidies. In addition, the Federation has also established a tuberculosis sanatorium, specifically for refugees suffering from tuberculosis to live in.

Refugees in the war zone were caught off guard and could not carry their clothes. At the same time, the Federation also provided relief to refugees outside the camps who had livelihood problems. Moore Church and the Women's Self-Government Association were responsible for most of the sewing work. According to Moore Church's annual work report, 1,130 cotton mattresses, cotton quilts, and bed sheets have been made, and 129,616 pieces of clothing have been made. They are still continuing to work. Last autumn, the weather in Shanghai was getting colder, and the Federation donated a large number of cotton vests to the soldiers at the front.

Regarding the food problem for the few refugees outside the above-mentioned camps, the Federation relieved 300,000 people of food in seven months through Moore Church.

Regarding the relief of wounded soldiers, the Federation was responsible for running several wounded soldiers hospitals during the war in Shanghai, and other wounded soldiers hospitals also directly or indirectly received economic and manpower assistance from the Federation. Soldiers who were seriously injured were given special diets. All wounded soldiers were given friendly comfort. Most of the young Christians volunteered to serve as nurses. After the wounded soldiers were discharged from the hospital, they wrote to express their longing for the kind care they had received.

After the closure of the various wounded soldiers hospitals, a Christian doctor from the West suggested that the Shanghai International Red Cross Society open a crippled wounded soldiers police academy to accommodate soldiers who had lost their legs and arms. This hospital was established on January 10 last year, and the address of the hospital was the old 17th Wounded Soldiers Hospital. The total number of wounded soldiers was 403. The hospital fitted them with prosthetic legs and arms to enable them to move. Those who were unemployed were taught living skills so that they would not wander the streets after being discharged from the hospital. After finding a new spirit of life, many of these soldiers volunteered to become Christians.

During the war in Shanghai, the Salvation Army, with the economic assistance of the Shanghai International Red Cross Society, established several refugee camps, one on West Yexian Road. Since the beginning of the war, it has accommodated a total of 23,000 refugees. The second refugee camp was established at Jiaotong University, which accommodated 17,000 refugees in seven months. In addition, the third refugee camp was set up on Xiaoshadu Road, accommodating 7,000 refugees, and a refugee tuberculosis hospital was set up to provide special care.

For homeless orphans, the Salvation Army took them in and taught them sewing, knitting socks, making shoes, carpentry, and making other daily necessities handicrafts, which have sold more than 2,000 yuan. Most of the refugees working in the camps have acquired skills to maintain their lives. After leaving the camp, they jointly contributed 80 yuan to the Salvation Army to express their gratitude and thanks.

Regarding the education of wounded soldiers and refugees, the Christian Federation regards it as a major task in relief work. Wounded soldiers gradually recovering in the hospital and refugees in various camps are given ordinary education, and at the same time they are also given vocational education, so that the refugees can maintain their livelihoods after leaving the camp.

Many residents of Nanshi have returned. Most of the houses have been burned down, and they pick up broken tiles and rubble to build walls to protect themselves from wind and frost. In view of this, the church formed the Puyi Handicraft Society in March last year. The Shanghai International Red Cross Society collects old clothes and broken socks and sends them there, where they are recycled and made into various practical items for sale. A clinic is also set up to help the poor and sick. Western doctors are responsible for voluntary work. In view of the importance of children's education, kindergartens and workers' children's classrooms have been established one after another, and because the refugees are malnourished, soy milk is made to supplement it.

Recently, these refugees have sought to cultivate fertile soil under dilapidated walls, broken bricks, and rubble to grow various vegetables for a living.

There are more than 200 people working in the handicraft society every day, and thousands of people are seeking help. Most refugees have no food or clothing and are dying. The handicraft society is also suffering from a lack of funds to hire more workers. One day, a member of the society voluntarily resigned to give the job to a more impoverished person. An old man donated eight jiao [角, unit of currency] in wages earned in eight days. This was all he had. This organization is in great need of expansion.

### The Shanghai YMCA’s Work During Extraordinary Times

Introduction: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the retreat of the National Army to the west, this YMCA, as a Christian social service organization, has upheld its inherent position and engaged in social services. Cherishing the grand aspiration of establishing oneself and others, we have strived to undertake various regular and extraordinary tasks. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our colleagues and the support and cooperation of people from all walks of life, we have achieved considerable results over the past year. At this time of upheaval, the YMCA is committed to providing practical services and encouraging the youth to maintain a positive spirit, all of which depends on the support of people from all sectors of society to benefit our fellow citizens. We hereby present a summary report on the YMCA's work over the past year, as follows:

(1) Relief and Assistance Work: A: Refugee Camps – Since the outbreak of the war, the YMCA has successively managed six refugee camps, including the third and sixth of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the first and second of the Guangdong Native Place Association's Refugee Relief Committee, and the Shanghai Christian Federation. At its peak, the refugee population reached over 27,000. In addition to dispatching responsible staff to preside over the camps, the YMCA has placed special emphasis on life training, moral education, and knowledge and skills for productive endeavors, with the ultimate goal of cultivating the four aspects of education and promoting personal growth. Therefore, all administrative management strives for scientific approaches, daily life emphasizes discipline, and an objective attitude is adopted to achieve the goal of educating the masses. Indeed, the cleanliness and orderliness of each camp, and the well-organized life of the refugees, are clear evidence of the perfect management of each camp.

B: Relief for Students Out of School – Initially, recognizing the urgency of the need, we joined forces with the YWCA to raise funds to subsidize students from impoverished families who were unable to continue their education due to the direct impact of the war. The methods included: (1) providing tuition loans and travel expenses to study in the interior, establishing work-study positions, and scholarships. To date, a total of over 660 students have benefited, with a total of 17,000 yuan in relief funds disbursed. Unfortunately, due to limited financial resources, there are still over a thousand students who registered but were unable to receive assistance. (2) Establishing student economic dormitories, initially in the Sichuan Road Association, with extremely low rents. Now, the seventh, eighth, and ninth floors of the Wuzhou Building have been opened as student dormitories, with spacious interiors, an initial investment and operating expenses of 20,000 yuan, and an estimated annual operating expense of 6,000 yuan. The hope is to create a fellowship spirit for young students and realize an ideal student dormitory.

C: Relief for Unemployed Youth – In addition to vocational guidance work, a production education plan is being considered, divided into four groups: teaching, crafts, sales, and job placement. The "Production Education Sales Corps" was then established, with the goal of promoting the sale of domestic goods, and the number of members is temporarily limited to fifty. Since its establishment, all members have worked hard and maintained excellent morale. Moreover, the members themselves have focused on training and self-cultivation, benefiting greatly in body and mind. Unfortunately, due to the recent establishment and limitations in human resources and capital, there is still a need for large-scale expansion.

D: Military Service Work – At the beginning of the Shanghai War, the YMCA was invited to send personnel to serve in the Municipal Ambulance Association. In addition, personnel were dispatched to work in various wounded soldier hospitals, divided into general affairs, propaganda, personnel, comfort, service (education and entertainment), and other groups. A total of eight hospitals were served, with the 23rd Wounded Soldier Hospital being the most prominent, with a total of over 70 service personnel. In addition, condolence items were solicited and cotton vests were made. Significant contributions were made to the spiritual comfort and encouragement of wounded soldiers and officers. Unfortunately, this work could not be continued in Shanghai after the retreat of the National Army. However, now that the war zone is vast, YMCAs across the country have already combined talent and resources to engage in large-scale military service work, working tirelessly and unremittingly in the midst of hardship and danger in military zones spanning thousands of miles. There are currently dozens of branches, with over 150 service personnel formally dispatched by the National YMCA, all of whom are risking their lives to serve the officers and soldiers at the front lines and the wounded soldiers being carried back. As a result, the YMCA's reputation in the interior has become widely known. Regardless of soldiers, civilians, or the public, everyone recognizes the YMCA upon seeing the red triangle. Indeed, the service personnel, with their fearless spirit, continue to work tirelessly, thus earning the respect and faith of their fellow soldiers and compatriots, a truly great endeavor.

(2) Sports Work: A: Construction of Temporary Gymnasium – The YMCA's new building in Baxianqiao originally had plans to build a new gymnasium. After Shanghai became an "isolated island," youth sports became an extremely important need. Recognizing this, the YMCA, with the cooperation and support of advanced figures in the sports world and YMCA members, quickly built a temporary gymnasium on the site of the new gymnasium to meet urgent needs. It was inaugurated on July 16, with a total construction and equipment cost of over 7,000 yuan. It is now used frequently, making a significant contribution to youth health and encouraging interest in sports.

(3) Laborer Children Welfare Services: A: Huxi Commune – The YMCA's Huxi Commune on Lubosheng Road is specifically designed to provide welfare services for laborers. All kinds of work, such as education, religion, health, and medicine, are tailored to the real needs of the lives of the working masses. It continues to be operated, with special emphasis on the education of workers' children, with 250 students in the morning and afternoon classes, religious gatherings, health work (such as setting up children's bathrooms), and medical services, with 30 to 50 poor and sick children visiting the commune every day.

(4) Children's Science Laboratory: In addition to day and night schools, the YMCA's intellectual education work also includes libraries and reading rooms in the two YMCA locations. In recent years, the libraries have often been full. The collections within the libraries are rich, with books and magazines of all kinds, which greatly benefit the public's intelligence. Recently, in order to encourage children's interest in science and establish a foundation for scientific talent for the country, a Children's Science Laboratory was established in the Sichuan Road branch and officially opened in early December. Since then, both children and adults have participated. Detailed information has already been reported in the newspapers, so I will omit it here.

### On "Wang Jingwei"

— Gan Wei

At the beginning of the War of Resistance, I remember Mr. Jingwei once saying, "Refugees are easily exploited by invaders and turned into traitors." At that time, Mr. Wang was, of course, a leading figure, and his remarks were naturally considered famous sayings. My speculation as to why refugees are easily exploited by invaders and turned into traitors is probably because a person has no confidence in the War of Resistance. In short, their will is not firm. The decision is probably driven by greed and disregard for the nation and ethnicity, willingly becoming traitors. Indeed, engaging in traitorous activities has always been referred to as a path to survival. Therefore, Mr. Wang at that time was able to have unique insight and warn refugees not to embark on this path to survival. However, today, the "path to death" is, of course, more prevalent than the "path to survival." If that is accurate, then why are the hundreds of thousands of homeless refugees on the "isolated island" willing to live the most miserable lives, struggling at the entrance to the "path to death," rather than taking the "path to survival" that Mr. Wang spoke of? The reason is simple: they hold onto a steadfast will, believing that final victory will belong to us. However, for a person who disregards shame and dignity, the "path to survival" is indeed not lacking.

Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang, who smeared refugees as being easily turned into traitors by invaders, has also transformed himself and revealed his true colors. However, we cannot determine whether Mr. Wang became a traitor for fame or fortune. We can understand this by reading the following telegram:

Chongqing, May 5 (Associated Press): Several weeks ago, a representative from Chongqing went to Hanoi to hand over his passport for traveling to Europe to Wang and gave him 200,000 yuan as expenses for traveling to Europe as a representative of the National Government for inspection. However, Wang still returned the money to Chongqing, reiterating his dignity, saying:

"I am not doing this for fame, nor can I be bought with money."

However, let's set aside the issue of whether Mr. Wang is doing this for fame or fortune. After reading the evidence of Wang Jingwei's collusion with Japan and conspiracy to betray the country published by Chongqing, I am deeply moved. Thinking of the famous poem he wrote in his youth, I cannot help but feel a sense of the contrast between the past and the present:

"Singing generously in the Yan market, calmly becoming a prisoner of Chu,
Drawing the knife to make it quick, living up to the youthful head."

The once sonorous verses have now been reduced to being covered in filth. How tragic that a famous person has come to this!

### Embezzlement, Occupation, Theft, and Other Things

— Zhang Zhensan

Under an unsound social system, the resulting abnormal phenomena inevitably have objective factors. In other words, a person's wrongdoing is not innate. The growth of all sins is based on the abnormal attraction in the real society. In a city with both good and bad elements, people who generally do not have the power to control their reason are often confused by certain things and take certain things as the object of realizing their desires or entrusting their emotions, resulting in irremediable bad results. This is an undeniable general situation.

Shanghai, a city of sin, has always been a place where people use fraud and deception to pursue material things. Recently, the number of gambling dens in western Shanghai and the impact they have on people with wavering wills have further accelerated the speed at which Shanghai produces sin, which is truly chilling.

In recent months, looking at the social news section of the newspaper, there have been records of business fraud, embezzlement, theft, and other bad consequences caused by entering and exiting gambling dens, almost every day, especially among salaried workers.

These salaried workers enter and exit gambling dens. Apart from a few gamblers who overestimate their abilities, I think they must have a fluke in their minds. In the current situation of rising prices, the lifestyle of salaried workers is naturally quite difficult. Expecting to increase material enjoyment is like "drawing a cake to satisfy hunger." Therefore, they open up other paths, hoping to enrich their lives with windfall gains, and enter and exit gambling dens. Unfortunately, the tragic consequences are simply ignored and disappear without a trace in their minds.

However, after entering the gambling den, no force can stop the growth and spread of sin, and no method can avoid bad consequences. They take their meager salary income and walk in, but not only do they have no hope of getting lucky and winning money, but they don't even have enough to bet, and they lose everything as soon as they lose. Therefore, they want to make a comeback after losing, and the money to make a comeback will inevitably be lost again, again and again, the more they sink, the more money they lose. All the money they depend on to live is exhausted, and their lives cannot stop without food and clothing. Under such double pressure, distorted thoughts and actions are bound to arise as a result. Not long ago, the newspaper reported: A bank clerk was discovered to have committed fraud, a shop assistant was discovered to have embezzled, a certain accountant owed a certain amount, and the wife and daughter's jewelry and clothes were mortgaged and exhausted, causing constant quarrels, which is really endless. And recently, it was reported that a certain silk shop partner stole several pieces of silk and was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. The root of these phenomena is the same, because they have to pay off the gambling den, and some even use this kind of money as gambling money. As a result, they have tasted the flavor of iron windows, which harms their wives and children and harms society. The power of the gambling den is really terrible!

These are still visible facts. Other things that have not been announced in the newspapers are even more numerous, and the number is several times more than those sentenced to several years or months in prison, right? This kind of social consequence is, on the one hand, due to the deformity of society, and on the other hand, it is also because the general public lacks determination and cannot control themselves. Knowing that there will be no good results, they still dare to try it, not to mention that this kind of gambling den is cultivated under special forces! For the current plan, it would be good to completely eradicate this kind of gambling den that kills people without using knives. Secondly, I also hope that the general public will wake up and not be too fascinated. At the same time, I hope that employers will pay full attention to the lives and actions of employees, rather than prevent them beforehand and try to remedy them afterwards. It is really a win-win solution. If there are embezzlements, occupations, thefts, etc. due to entering and exiting gambling dens, and there is a commotion in society, the person's entry, reputation, and integrity are naturally bankrupt, and the employer's side also has the shortcomings of imprecise management and unsound internal organization exposed.

### A Romantic Female Ghost

— Yan Hua

"Topper Takes A Trip"

I have mentioned in a certain film that Chinese films were once also making films about demons, gods, and ghosts. The main motivation for this cannot but be said to be influenced by American films. American films have horror films such as "Zombie" and "Old House Monster," and we also have "Old House Walking Corpse" and "Cold Moon Poem Soul." People have "London Werewolf" and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," and we also have "Human-Ape Transformation." From these examples, we can resolutely say that the Chinese Film Censorship Board must insist on the past regulations prohibiting the screening of supernatural and horror films. These films are not only of no benefit to individuals, but their legacy is even more unimaginable. Looking at the example of Chinese film companies imitating and making supernatural and horror films, we hope that the Chinese government can immediately restore the pre-war inspection system and absolutely prohibit this kind of boring and ghostly film.

"Romantic Female Ghost" can be seen from the name what kind of content it contains. Regardless of whether this kind of film only wants to use photography techniques to deceive the audience, its objective effect is only one, that is, to make people believe that there is a ghost. For this kind of film, even if you are a skillful advertising propagandist, you have no way to explain "This is a dignified and educational film"!

Therefore, turning it around, precisely because of its distorted concept, it can anesthetize the audience, weaken the Chinese will to resist the war, and make the Chinese audience indulge in the heresy of these gods, monsters, demons, and ghosts. We also demand that the Chinese government prohibit the import and screening of such films.

"Romantic Female Ghost" can be said to be a sequel to "Romantic Samadhi." The main actors are still the original two protagonists: Constance Bennett and Roland Young. The beginning of the story re-narrates the origins of the male and female ghosts in "Romantic Samadhi." The following writes that banker Topper wants to find his wife, so he goes to Europe with the female ghost.

The story is empty. From beginning to end, the playwright only uses photography techniques to make objects automatically appear out of thin air and the female ghost overlaps and appears to win the audience's laughter. However, after four or five times, when the audience is accustomed to that old trick, the audience feels bored and does not feel funny at all. The playwright also reveals several weaknesses in the script writing: (1) Because it relies too much on these photography techniques, the characters it describes have no emotions; (2) In order to only use these chaotic magic tricks to deceive the audience, the script writing is very loose and messy; (3) It has never been considered to care for the atmosphere in the scene, so although the female ghost still tries her best to perform, it has not aroused the audience's interest; (4) The ending of the whole play is flat and relaxed, and there is no dramatic climax at all, so the reconciliation of Topper and his wife in the end makes people feel reluctant and weak.

If you want to point out a good point of the whole play, then it is the fact that a woman who thinks she is a noblewoman does not know it and actually drinks champagne with a servant's brain. After she knows he is a servant, she immediately stands up, her face changes, and she drives him out. Using such a satirical tone to write about the depth of the class concept of ordinary people is the most real thing in the whole film.

Roland Young plays this kind of role very well. Constance Bennett's female ghost does not have any special highlights. I think anyone can play this kind of role.

### Mulan Joins the Army

Last night I saw the military post, the Khan was conscripting soldiers. The military book had twelve volumes, and each volume had my father's name. My father has no grown-up son, Mulan has no elder brother. I am willing to buy a saddle and horse in the market and go to war for my father from now on.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Seven: The Nestling Swallows and Orioles are Linked Together, Yue Silk and Wu Brocade are Woven with Seven Designs

Because of this, the two Miss Si very much wanted to go to Freedom Village sooner. They heard that Freedom Village was a new village, and all the planning was new. They had already asked Zhu Airen to ask her grandfather if there was a suitable address for setting up a textile factory? Village Chief Zhu Laoyuan replied in his letter: "There is plenty of land here. There is land along the highway, there is land along the river, and there is land with convenient land and water transportation. Please come to Freedom Village and survey the terrain yourself. However, Freedom Village has been developing very well recently, and quite a few people have come here to build factories. It would be more appropriate to come earlier." Zhu Airen told them what her grandfather meant, and they were even more eager to go to Freedom Village to see it. Zhu Airen promised to accompany them to Freedom Village this Sunday. However, Airen was a little hesitant in her heart, because she could not easily leave the hospital for a day, and she could not always accompany them in Freedom Village. What about her mother? She is very sincere and straightforward in treating people. But to be honest, she is still from a peasant family after all. How can she get along with these two rich daughters, who have been in the Golden Yuan Country for many years? Unless she accompanies them there and then accompanies them back again, letting them live in Anle Town again. Otherwise, she will leave them in Freedom Village and let them fumble around on their own. Or perhaps the old grandfather has a way to entertain them, which is also unknown. Later, after thinking carefully, she came up with someone. It turned out that Zhu Airen had a cousin named Zhu Aiqun, who lived in Freedom Village. This Zhu Aiqun was three years older than Airen. She was also a female midwife. She was also a nurse in this Women and Children's Hospital. Now she is a midwife. When Mr. Zhu organized Freedom New Village, everything was new. The old-fashioned midwives used by rural people had no place to stand. Women in labor could no longer be subjected to the surgery of ignorant old women. If they could not be sent to the hospital, they had to be delivered according to the new method. However, Freedom Village was still a little far from the Women and Children's Hospital in Anle Town, which was inconvenient for many women. At that time, there were still few villagers in Freedom Village, and it was not worthwhile to set up a branch there. Therefore, Village Chief Zhu and Doctor Zhang discussed it and said it would be better to send Zhu Aiqun to Freedom Village. Zhu Aiqun was working as a nurse in the hospital, and she had a lot of experience in obstetrics and gynecology, which Doctor Zhang trusted. She was also the granddaughter of Mr. Zhu, so she could be said to be suitable for the people and the place. When she came to Freedom Village, Airen had not yet returned from the United States, and it had already been three years. (83)

Economic Supplement

### Yen and Sword (Continued - Conclusion)

— Special Correspondent

This article is written by the famous American economic journalist G. Stein and published in the March issue of "Pacific Affairs" magazine. We are very grateful to Mr. Wu Te-gong for taking the time to translate it. The first three sections were published in the previous issue of this journal. The first section describes the Japanese side's obstruction before and after China implemented the legal tender policy, and reveals the causes and consequences of the Japanese side's obstruction and the inside story of its failure. The second section reveals the position of the legal tender market in the current war of resistance and the general situation of the currency war launched outside the military war of resistance. On the one hand, it points out the role of the Japanese side in organizing the "Yen Bloc," and on the other hand, it explains in detail the power of the legal tender counterattack. The third section focuses on the yen itself, criticizing the background of its engagement in the currency war and the key points of its strategy. The following sections further analyze the background of the "Yen Bloc," explaining the strengths and weaknesses of its combat power and the success or failure of its combat future. The author's vision is sharp, and the translation is faithful and powerful. After reading it, one can understand that the author's title "Yen and Sword" is merely a satire. Furthermore, in the previous issue, the original magazine title and article title "Yen and Sword" were reversed in typesetting. We hereby correct it. - Editor

Currency Occupation and Market Seizure

Before this war, Japan was very dissatisfied with the amount of its exports to China. In 1936, the last year of peace, China, with 400 million buyers, accounted for only 4.4% of Japan's total exports to foreign countries and colonies; this figure was equal to 16.3% of China's total purchases from foreign countries. Now, look at how different the situation is for Japanese exporters in areas that are already under solid Japanese rule, where there is no foreign currency interference, and where the yen has become dominant! Each Japanese territory, although far smaller in area and population than China, purchased more Japanese goods in 1936 than China, which Japan often declares it desires to "cooperate" with and which has the largest population in the world.

Taiwan, Japan's oldest colony, with a population of just over five million, accounted for 6.8% of Japan's total exports. This means that Taiwan purchased 83.3% of its foreign goods from its "mother country," 9.1% from other Japanese territories, and only 7.6% from non-Japanese areas. Korea, Japan's second largest colony, with a population of 23 million, purchased Japanese goods accounting for 18.5% of Japan's total exports, which is equal to 85.1% of Korea's total imports. The remaining 8.7% of imports came from other Japanese territories, so Korea's purchases from foreign countries accounted for only 6.2% of imports. Manchukuo, which has only been under Japanese rule for a short time, has not yet reached the ideal state of relying on its elder brother for "cooperation," but it has made great progress in this direction. In 1930, the year before the September 18th Incident, the purchases of Japanese goods by its 30 million residents were less than 6.4% of Japan's total exports, but by 1936, it had increased to 14.8%. In 1930, Japanese goods accounted for 39.3% of Manchukuo's total purchases from foreign countries, and by 1936, it had increased to 75.1%. The remaining 22.8% was supplied by foreign merchants, most of which were goods used directly or indirectly by the Kwantung Army for military preparations within "Manchukuo." In 1936, the three major Japanese territories purchased Japanese goods accounting for 40.1% of Japan's total exports, while China accounted for 4.4%, and countries completely outside Japan's sphere of political influence accounted for 55.5%.

Judging by analogy with Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo," after the "Yen Bloc" has controlled the occupied areas and the suppressed parts of China for several years, at least in theory, China will allow the Japanese Empire to supply about 70% to 80% of its import needs. But even then, the amount of Japanese goods purchased by China, based on pre-war 1936 estimates, will likely still not reach 20% of Japan's total exports. In other words, the benefit that 400 million Chinese people, whom Japan is still making great efforts to suppress, give to Japanese exporters has not exceeded the total contribution of 27 million Taiwanese and Koreans in 1936. Even then, 40% of Japan's total exports will still need to be sold in foreign markets outside the "Yen Bloc," which means that the main factor for the continued active expansion of Japanese exports will still be the willingness of foreign countries to purchase more. However, if Japan can completely incorporate China into the "Yen Bloc," it can have a good opportunity to gradually reduce China's current relatively high economic self-sufficiency, so that Japan can make China more dependent on Japan for increased supply, just as Japan is now harboring this goal for Taiwan and Korea, and manipulating "Manchukuo" to a certain extent. Having said that, this matter is still a long way off.

Now, Japan has begun to incorporate most of the places it occupies in China into the "Yen Bloc" by nominal means. Trade between Japanese and occupied areas is now officially called "Yen Bloc Trade," the same as trade between Japan and Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo." According to the regulations promulgated by the Japanese military authorities in North China, the banknotes of the newly established "United Reserve Bank" have been used as legal tender in a wide area and can be fully exchanged for yen; the bank's financial policy is entirely controlled by the Japanese. In addition to the "United Reserve" banknotes, the original yen and "Manchukuo" banknotes have been forcibly fixed at the same value and are circulating in North China. However, the total amount of these three currencies combined is far less than the total amount of Chinese legal tender in North China. Chinese legal tender is still widely used among the people, and it is by no means only used in inland counties that have not been reached by the Japanese army. It still occupies a superior position among the people, and although there are prohibitions against using it again, and severe punishments for anyone found using "old banknotes" without exchanging them for "United Reserve" banknotes at an 80% discount, it is of no effect. The new situation in North China has allowed Japanese exports to flood the market. According to Japan's officially published trade reports, in the first eight months of 1938, monthly exports to North China averaged three times higher than before the war in 1936. If we calculate the exports indirectly transported to North China through the Kwantung Leased Territory (a large number of Japanese goods were smuggled through this route before the war, until recently when it stopped), its total amount, although the total amount of North China's purchases from foreign countries has been greatly reduced due to the war, still seems to be more than twice as high as two years ago. The emergence of the "Yen Bloc" in Central China has so far relied more on the circulation of military scrip issued by the Japanese army to meet military and commercial needs, and is gradually expanding, but Japanese exporters are also eagerly taking advantage of their opportunities there. During the same period, the average monthly increase in Japanese exports to these areas was naturally smaller, because the purchasing power and economic organization within the territory had been completely destroyed; but the amount of Japanese goods in Central China's total imports has increased by about four times. In the newly occupied areas of South China, Japanese "military scrip" has begun to be used, and similar developments are expected. These advances are achieved by depriving the interests of third countries and Chinese domestic manufacturers. Although Japan has increased the Japanese export market and excluded other countries by forming the "Yen Bloc" in the conquered Chinese war zone, and seems to have embarked on the path of realizing the first goal, it is currently not impossible to cope with the second goal, otherwise the "Yen Bloc" will eventually suffer a tragic failure.

Plunder of Raw Materials and Plunder of Foreign Exchange

Japan proper also has a long-standing and continuous need to import a large number of goods, especially raw materials that Japan itself does not produce. This requires foreign exchange to purchase these goods in markets with abundant world inventory. Japan's import needs are increasing with the increase in its military preparations and the expansion of its industrial equipment. Japan is eager to rely on controlling new sources of raw materials and foreign exchange income to become less dependent on foreign countries in the import market. This is another motivation for the war against China, and another reason for trying to expand the "Yen Bloc" to conquered lands. It can be seen that the success or failure in this regard is the main factor on the conditions of the future success or failure of Japan's efforts to expand the export industry with the "Yen Bloc." In terms of the supply of imported goods, the results given by the Japanese Empire are not as good as those given to the export market. Before this war, the three major territories accounted for the following parts of Japan proper's total exports: Taiwan 9.8%, Korea 14.2%, "Manchukuo" 6.3%, totaling 30.3%. The food needed by Japan is supplied by these three places, (food actually accounts for most of the goods sold by the three places to the "mother country.") But the part of the important raw materials and other goods needed by the three places in Japan's industrial needs in the total number of imports is much less than the above numbers. China's pre-war exports to Japan accounted for 4.2% of the total amount Japan proper purchased from foreign countries, and now China's most important commercial cities have been incorporated into the "Yen Bloc," and Japan is now trying its best to take advantage of the opportunity to import more goods from China. But the result is disappointing to the Japanese, although the Japanese can reach out and take all the valuable items they see in the occupied areas, and exclude foreigners who purchase Chinese products; although the Japanese no longer need to use foreign exchange to purchase goods in China; although the Japanese depress prices and force purchases, or often confiscate things in practice, as they usually do at home.

In the first eight months of 1938, the average monthly number of Japanese imports from North China increased by three and a half times compared to 1936. During this period, there was still a major military disturbance in Central China, and Japanese imports from the region had fallen to only one-fifth of what they used to be. But once the situation in the territory is similar to that in North China, the same increase can be expected. Finally, Central China's profit sources will also be squeezed in the same way. Although the Japanese development plan has these possible hopes, the victory makes Japan less dependent on other foreign countries for its needs because of China. This is another reason why Japan is taking advantage of the perfect opportunity to incorporate half of China into the "Yen Bloc"; not only to completely squeeze out every kind of Chinese raw material useful to Japan, but also to make China supply as much foreign exchange as possible to pay for Japan's continuous purchases from foreign markets. Therefore, the main problem that Japan's "Greater Yen Bloc" must deal with is foreign exchange. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Empire was extremely dissatisfied with foreign exchange. Now, let's go back to 1936, when Korea and Taiwan, like Japan proper, suffered from a shortage of foreign exchange. Although the total amount of goods they purchased from foreign countries, that is, non-Japanese countries, was small, it still exceeded the total amount sold to these countries by a lot. In 1936, their total excess of people was paid by Japan in foreign exchange, totaling 57.3 million yen.

According to official foreign trade reports, Japan's own excess of people in the same year totaled 70.8 million yen, but the largest part of the excess of people, (in 1936, Japan had to pay a huge amount for this, and used up all the free gold reserves of foreign exchange, and at the beginning of the war in 1936, it was beaten to start selling a huge number of gold.) is related to "Manchukuo" and its transshipment port of Dalian in the Kwantung Leased Territory. These two Japanese territories are the initiators of the "Yen Bloc," and their excess of people totaled 25.87 million yen. The difference in their import and export trade is indeed entirely due to the fact that the total amount they purchased from the "mother country" far exceeded the total amount they sold to the "mother country." But because this kind of trade between Japan proper and the "Manchukuo" Kwantung Leased Territory is not truthfully recorded in Japan's so-called foreign trade reports, and because both parties, by analogy, deliberately reduce Japan's excess of people to the minimum number, this difference should be listed as the largest of the three items used to make up for the total number of comparative shortages in the trade between the Japanese Empire and various countries. If "Manchukuo" is incorporated into the "Yen Bloc" and fails to enable Japan to provide for its own use the excess foreign exchange obtained from the high amount of soybeans sold by "Manchukuo" in transactions with non-Japanese foreign countries, then the above difference may increase by more than 100 million yen. This point cannot be ignored.

Japan's Absolute Emptiness of Foreign Exchange

Japan's foreign exchange problem is now even more serious than before. In the first year of the war against China, Japan had spent 50% of its gold reserves, and this gold had to be sold overseas in order to offset the trade deficit of the empire. Moreover, during this year's war, Japan also purchased a large amount of military supplies to maintain its inventory, and only the three items of cotton, wool, and American wood used up 80%, 70%, and 60% respectively. And the foreign raw materials that are usually needed have been reduced to the extent that they cannot continue to maintain imports. If this continues, then the export industry of Japanese manufactured goods such as cotton cloth, which contains foreign raw materials, will be in danger of complete cessation. Therefore, the foreign exchange problem has made the Japanese leaders even more uneasy, and they are even more doubtful about whether it is beneficial to gradually expand export trade within the "Yen Bloc" region. Most of the exported goods contain raw materials that Japan needs to purchase in the world market with foreign exchange. Although the export trade to the "Yen Bloc" region has expanded, the imports from this region have not expanded equally, and the foreign exchange received from the exports sold to foreign countries. The increase in the excess of people that Japan has incurred in trade with its newest territories is now indicated by the following numbers: Japan's exports to the non-colonial part of the "Yen Bloc" averaged 41.5 million yen per month in 1936, but in the first eight months of 1938, it has increased by more than double, but during the same period, Japan's average number of non-colonial imports subsidized by the various foreign countries' yen blocs was only 19.9 million yen in 1936, and only 49 million yen in 1938. Japan has also not continued to receive much foreign exchange from these newly obtained places. The net amount of foreign exchange received from the trade surplus outside the "Yen Bloc" of "Manchukuo" can be regarded as a gift to Japan. In 1936, it was 13.3 million yen per month, but in the first six months of 1938, "Manchukuo's" trade with foreign countries showed a monthly deficit of 2 million yen, which had to be offset by Japanese appropriations. Japan may be able to continue to obtain a considerable amount of foreign exchange in North China and Central China. Japanese personnel are currently relying on the active assistance of the army in those two places, trying their best to collect Chinese legal tender in exchange for "United Reserve" banknotes, or yen banknotes, or to pay for Japanese exports, but the Chinese government is currently implementing a policy of maintaining legal tender so that it can be exchanged for foreign exchange, so the benefits obtained by Japan are indeed not very large. The fact that legal tender still occupies a dominant position in most occupied areas and that the general public is unwilling to let it fall into the hands of the Japanese is indeed the main obstacle encountered by the "Yen Bloc" in these areas.

People only need to think a little about Japan's position of having a trade surplus in its trade with the new land in the "Yen Bloc" to easily understand why Japan should not encourage exports to various places in the "Yen Bloc." At least, it should not transport various manufactured products containing foreign raw materials, or that can be sold for foreign exchange in the world market, to various places that have joined the "Yen Bloc." These leased lands are now regarded too much as an important part of Japan's domestic market. In the mainland, like Japan in general, all kinds of trade regulations are drawn up with negative significance to prevent goods from being sold to second-class customers who cannot pay in other currencies and can only pay in yen or yen-dependent banknotes. This is not only very difficult for Japanese exporters, but also greatly frustrates the soldiers who are eagerly promoting Sino-Japanese "cooperation." Therefore, Japan now feels that only by fully controlling China's exports to third countries and confiscating the foreign exchange obtained from this trade for the application of the "Yen Bloc" can Japan's trade obtain various benefits from the newly emerging currency alliance, and these benefits will be the spoils of victory.

Japanese Attempts to Destroy the Whole Thing

Japan's aggressive path in China is, at least for the time being, blocked because it cannot control the foreign exchange income from China's exports to third countries. There is also a more important reason: Japan's new currency used in North China is just a piece of paper that can only be exchanged for another kind of paper (non-convertible yen.) has proven to be a major failure, so Japan is hesitant to withdraw the "yen military scrip" in Central China according to the original plan and use the same currency. This kind of "military scrip" cannot even be a legal tender in "Liberated New China" and can never get the trust of any Chinese that the Japanese army's bayonets cannot reach. When Chinese currency can still be exchanged for foreign exchange, any new currency must at least have a part of China's current foreign exchange income as a backing in order to get the opportunity to compete with Chinese legal tender and gradually abolish it. Therefore, to achieve economic victory in the war against China, if they can get it, there is still a vicious circle that must be broken: because they cannot have the Chinese currency that allows exports to flow, they cannot control China's export trade to third countries; because the inherent value of Chinese legal tender far exceeds the substitutes they use, they cannot control or destroy China's "old currency"; because if they want to create a better substitute before Chinese legal tender is completely destroyed, the only obvious way is to make this substitute freely convertible to gold yen or gold pounds. In the current situation, it can only be exchanged by transporting Chinese products to foreign countries, so it is impossible for them to create a better substitute for this Chinese legal tender. The Japanese are now using bayonets to carry out this work, trying to reduce the flow of Chinese products to the world market, but not only have they failed to achieve the desired effect, but they have also encouraged their exports. Therefore, the construction of the "Yen Bloc" in China is still far from completion. No matter what kind of economic and financial close relationship there is between today's Crystal Book and its permanent control of the territory on the one hand, and the estimated area in China on the other hand, this relationship is still completely based on the wild efforts of the Japanese army; a closer and more coercive force of the monetary union has not yet been truly realized. Even if a "peace agreement" is reached between the two countries, even if this peace agreement allows Ben to fulfill its desire to rule China, it is difficult to expect this situation to change quickly.

At the same time, Japan is currently using force to at least lay the foundation for those economic policies, hoping that the monetary institutions of the "Yen Bloc" will eventually operate smoothly, effectively, and almost automatically, so that the encroachment on the interests of China or third countries will not be too obvious; and is preparing to have Chinese members implement modern methods of controlling foreign exchange in the name of "New China" to replace the brutal intervention in trade and industry that Japanese army and navy officers are currently accustomed to. An elaborate discriminatory bureaucracy - such as hot photos, quotas, restrictive regulations, donation taxes and tax rule manipulation, credit loan regulations, etc., Japan has developed all of this in its country and its territories into its own extremely successful recent feudalism, together with the powers of the two major patent enterprises (North China and Central China Development Company) that have been given to Japan, is now quietly planning to fulfill Japan's ambitions. This is nothing more than turning China into a major part of the Yen Bloc, like Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo"; developing various Chinese products useful to Japan; turning other things that now or in the future may cause competition with Japanese industry into nothing; turning China's pre-war vast and growing self-sufficiency into complete dependence on Japan; and reducing the economic exchange between China and the world outside the Yen Bloc to the extent that it suits Japan's own needs. But Japan wants to achieve this economic victory over China and the long-established Western interests. The prospect is bleak, and it is difficult to achieve the goal for a while, because Western interests and China's modern progress are closely integrated and have become a legitimate and independent unit throughout the country. Even if Japan can achieve this economic victory due to Western resistance or the inability to maintain China's long-term war of resistance, it seems that there is still no certainty that Japan's economic problems will be resolved within the "Greater Yen Bloc."

### Wartime China's Economic Diplomacy (Continued)

— Zhang Xiaomei

Dr. Zhang Xiaomei is a renowned Chinese and foreign economist who has served as the director of the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China and sponsored the National Institute of National Economy of China. It is said that Dr. Zhang has also been appointed as the deputy director of the soon-to-be-established National Southwest Economic Research Institute. This article is a chapter from Dr. Zhang's newly compiled "China and Foreign Economic Yearbook," published by the National Institute of National Economy of China. Dr. Zhang kindly provided this journal with permission to publish it before the yearbook was released, and we began disclosing it in the last issue of the journal. The first section discusses how economy is key to the success or failure of modern warfare, and points out the importance of economic diplomacy. The second section records the international economic movements to resist aggression. The third section observes the achievements of our country's economic diplomacy over the past year. At that time, it only mentioned the diplomatic relations between China and the United States, and the economic relations between China and Britain and China and France. It was not until this issue that we were able to continue publishing it. This was due to limited space. Therefore, we have extracted the main points of the above article to coordinate the beginning and the end. We hope that the author and the readers will understand the delays.

China-UK. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, our country's coastal ports have been threatened. Tianjin and Shanghai bore the brunt. The focus of foreign trade initially shifted to South China, relying on Hong Kong as an opening. However, the situation in Guangzhou was precarious and eventually untenable. Therefore, from the beginning, the government was eager to find another way to open the "back door," so that foreign supplies and native product exports could still flow smoothly without hindrance.

The滇緬 [Yunnan-Burma] Road had been discussed long ago. The British side had also long intended to open up trade in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. However, it was not until the promotion of the War of Resistance that hundreds of thousands of people worked day and night to complete the entire line in a few months, and it was opened to traffic in July of the thirty-eighth year. Thus, Sino-British economic cooperation was further advanced.

Since the opening of the滇緬 [Yunnan-Burma] Road, there have been rumors that the British will provide loans to build the滇緬 [Yunnan-Burma] Railway. When Japan openly overturned the Nine-Power Treaty and put forward the so-called Greater East Asia New Order, clearly excluding the rights and interests of foreign businessmen, the British and American sides took joint action and discussed retaliation against Japan. On December 6, the London news of the Chinese-English newspaper, "字林西報," said that the Chinese government planned to build a thousand miles of the华西 [Western China] Railway and had ordered 850 steel plate cars from the British Leeds company, and also ordered 25 miles of building rails in preparation for first connecting Kunming and Dali, and then seeking expansion.

On December 15, Havas News Agency's London news confirmed that the Sino-British loan had been agreed in principle, and a loan of 10 million pounds would be given to the Chinese government for the construction of the railway from 下关 [Xiaguan] (near Dali in Yunnan) to the滇緬 [Yunnan-Burma] border. The railway project will be managed entirely by British businessmen and assisted by the Export Guarantee Bureau. However, it is said that the cost of the railway is only 6 million pounds, and the remaining 4 million pounds can be used to purchase other railway materials and trucks. In addition, there are also rumors that the British "credit to China" this year is only 500,000 pounds, and the newly established Central Exchange Equalization Fund's new loan of 5 million pounds is the sound of Britain's decision to use its financial resources to help China.

Although British and American loans are commercial in nature, they are not without political implications. Therefore, the national opinion unanimously welcomes them, such as妇纳之, with five points: (1) At this time when the War of Resistance is turning into the first stage, foreign loans, no matter how large or small, can encourage the people and inspire morale; (2) It shows British and American friendship; (3) It consolidates our determination to honor our debts; (4) The political nature of which is quite noteworthy: (5) It is bound to arouse Japanese opposition, but we are increasingly confident that we can break the illusion of the aggressor's Asian empire.

China-France. Sino-French relations have always been very good. According to the 밀勒 [Millard's] Review of the Far East [談論報] on May 7, in the article "Southwest Welcomes Foreign Investment" (author Wong Hin), it is said that "a French banking group has established a loan with the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company. The railway management is entirely under the responsibility of the Sichuan-Guizhou Company. Only two French experts are hired to supervise the project during the construction period. All materials are purchased in the open market; the loan guarantee is provided solely by the China Construction Bank (wholly Chinese-operated). The debt collection matters are assisted by the Debt Committee organized by the railway company." According to the article on French Influence in China in the famous New York magazine Far Eastern Survey on May 28, this loan is estimated to be 34.5 million Chinese national currency, of which 7 million is paid in cash, and the remaining 27.5 million is used to purchase materials.

The above loan method, which is purely a commercial investment and eliminates any additional conditions, has set a precedent for Sino-foreign economic cooperation. In the 四南 [Southern Sichuan] Railway plan, there is one from Guangxi Nanning to the Vietnamese border, which is related to the heavy legal interests. Now that British and American loans have started, France has responded.

In the midst of the destruction of war, we are still gaining the trust and assistance of the great powers, while the Japanese side's activities in the world only result in consistent accusations. This is because of our country's wartime economic diplomacy achievements, and it is also because our country's War of Resistance is a mission that any nation should have for independent survival; and in order to ensure peace in East Asia, even the cooperation of various countries around the world with China's wartime economy should be progressing steadily.

### Finance: No Cash Transactions Still; Gold Ornaments Suspended at Original Price

Yesterday's cash烚赤dark market situation, because it was within the Spring Festival holiday, so no members were present, but the idle more parties still wanted to sell at the late closing price before the holiday (April 6) of 2,068 yuan, and those who entered must reduce several yuan before they are willing to absorb and purchase, and it was not heard that there were transactions in the money exchange shops, the gold ornaments in silver shops, the exchange of each tael, still suspended at the original price, 大同 [Datong] Bank was 210 yuan, 新同 [Xintong] Bank was 208 yuan,收進 [purchased] at 202 yuan, British pure gold was closed due to Easter, no electricity云.

### Metals: New Lead Wire Sales Are Booming in Tianjin

The transaction of new lead wire has been exceptionally exciting recently. Various gangs in Qingdao and Yantai are vying to buy it, so the transaction is smooth and prosperous. The sales volume of the Tianjin gang is particularly high, so the opening has reached four or five thousand bundles in the past few days. The spot goods on the market have been searched and emptied, and the market price is increasing steadily. At the moment, the coarse color is sold for 22.5 yuan, the medium-grade color is sold for 21 yuan, and the fine color is extremely scarce in the market. The standard opening price has risen from 27.5 yuan to 30 yuan. The 24th and 25th colors are even more popular because the new goods are not available. For example, the 24th is sold for 35 yuan, and the 25th is sold for 40 yuan (the highest record of the market price of new lead wire), but customers are still willing to enter, but unfortunately there is no goods to buy, so the latecomers have the sorrow of having no goods to buy.

### Paper: After the Source Is Blocked, Tin Foil Continues to Rise

The price of tin foil in the 清明 [Qingming] Festival news has gradually increased, but some people in the industry expect that there will be a return to peace after the festival, but Ningbo suddenly announced the blockade, and the source was blocked. The existence in the festival news has been extremely digested. Although the source can be transferred from Wenzhou and Taizhou to Shanghai, the cost of the commission will inevitably increase. The manufacturers will move the goods stored in the Shanghai warehouse before the period and increase the price by 2 yuan per large piece. The local foil merchants convened a temporary meeting the day before yesterday and decided to increase the wholesale and retail prices appropriately to maintain costs, but the increase was not enough, and it may be necessary to increase it again when necessary, but the digestion has indeed decreased云.

### Seafood: Newly Arrived Aden Bald Sea Cucumber Sold Yesterday

The small bald sea cucumber was 109 yuan, the middle bald sea cucumber was 135 yuan, the large bald sea cucumber was 160 yuan, the top bald sea cucumber was 180 yuan, and the black bald sea cucumber was 189 yuan. The market is stable.

Recently, 106 yuan (cash) has been opened. It is heard that a certain number still has more than 100 pieces, and the price is 110 yuan (the customer's return price is 108 yuan) (cash), and the agreement has not been reached.

Commercial Knowledge

### Inside Story of Woolen Cloth Trading

— Fushi Sheng

(1) Business Experience

The business experience in commerce is like unpredictable changes, as Mr. Longju Sheng said, "Everyone can do magic tricks, and each has different skills." And the sales transactions in our woolen cloth industry are naturally different from the changes inside the yarn industry. Now let's talk about the business experience of changing sales transactions! Whether it is a firm or a factory, a street broker, or a seller, holding samples to solicit business everywhere, in addition to the brand-new and cheap goods that everyone knows, all say that they are newly arrived goods, new products, and new colors. Once the buyer "selects and wants to use to discuss the market," they all say: the stock is limited, it is popular and selling well, a certain number wants to absorb Gongduan [exclusive control], and has returned the price but not sold; a certain two numbers have added two purchases; a certain point or one-tenth of a class of words. If you encounter old colors, then Yun: in the future, you are not willing to cheapen, and the number of people, such as the number of people, are returning the price, but they are not willing to. At present, they need money and want to sell the goods for money urgently. It is really a loss-making price cut. If you want to buy, it is really a good opportunity. Get there first, to avoid Xiang Yu. If the price cannot be calculated, the price of selling to a certain number is a few, and it is not necessary to publicize it. For example, "buy one or two匹 [pi]," and say: this is your face, according to the law, add a 疋 [pi] discretionarily. Also, if it is actually tacitly approved with a stamp or with a check, then Yun: if it is someone else's, it must be done in cash. On the contrary, the buyer's customers, when they encounter happy and tasteful people, mostly say no, and deliberately "set up a shelf" because they want to bargain. In short, this kind of business experience is all about you cheating me, and even selling personality to swear to people. It can also be seen that the "business experience" is full of treacherousness and tricks. Recently, the situation has changed greatly, and everyone feels that this is not what commercial ethics should have. The false habits should be eliminated, and sincerity should be bred. This is the real "business experience"!

(2) Wholesaling Goods

The price of wholesaling original boxes of goods is fairer than拆疋[splitting up] because a box of four匹 [pi] or six匹 [pi], the colors cannot be moved, so non-large households宁愿 [would rather] sell zero. In 89% of the wholesaling goods, after the transaction is completed, the码单 [yards sheet] is first selected, and the goods are shipped after payment. The remittance is based on the market discount (or a full cash statement is made in advance), and there are also those who ship the goods first and then collect the payment, but the truth is very small. After the 码单 [yards sheet] is selected, if it is not cleared within a week, a deposit must be paid. It is noted on the invoice that it will be cleared in half a month or 20 days, otherwise the deposit will be confiscated. On the contrary, if the goods are sold to him, the loss will be compensated by one or two times the amount of the deposit. However, it is very scarce to pay a deposit and not ship or sell it to him (however, if the deposit is not paid, and the market is good or bad, there are often disputes between the two parties.) Recently, it is impossible to pay such a 寂洋 [silent ocean] and ship the goods within the time limit, because the current market situation is changing. If you do not prepay and clear the goods on the same day or within two or three days, you will not be willing to pay for the goods.

(3) Three零匹 [Zero Pi] Goods

Because you can choose the color, the price is about one corner more than the wholesaled ones. The seller sends them to the buyer, and the cartage, no matter how much, is borne by the seller. Whether it is cash or check, or remittance or return receipt, it is stated at the time of sale. The opening price varies according to the type of payment, and naturally it is more cost-effective to trade in cash. For 疋头 [Pitou] goods, those who are shrewd at the buyer's threshold want to re-measure the yards. According to the usual practice, it can be removed if it is less than half a yard in one疋 [pi], and the buyer has to suffer if it is less than half a yard, because according to the rules of the洋行 [foreign firm] for ordering goods, the original疋 [pi] has seals on both ends, and those who are less than half a yard cannot be marked with a fork. Because the零疋 [zero pi] goods are mostly sent to the goods and attached with invoices (the codes are not selected in advance), there are often changes. If the seller encounters goods that are popular and the price rises, there will be a high price and then he will sell them, or there will be a lack of one color and one匹 [pi], or even say that the goods have been preempted, or that the price must be increased by a certain amount (the store number with credit will never do this.) However, the buyer has no evidence and it is difficult to theorize. Turning around, if there is a sudden change of heart, then it is said that the body is bad, the color is slightly different, or the price is cut or the goods are returned. This procedure is not available for 批 [wholesale] the entire box of goods. As the saying goes, "a grain of rice on the mouth, the teeth are buckled to the ground."

(4) Spot Goods

The so-called spot goods, that is, the goods are in the occupied area or in the warehouse, and the delivery is cleared immediately after the transaction (there are also cases where the customer delays for a few days.) 期货 [Forward contract] refers to the goods that have not yet arrived at the port and are sold in advance, stating that they will be delivered in about half a month or a month, and the contract码 [code] is selected first as proof. If there are changes in the market and the contract period is lost, the two parties often have things that they do not keep their word. Therefore, the trade in futures transactions has been quite lacking recently. (To be continued)

### Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Dr. Liu Zhanen

— Qin

April 7 this year is the day of Jesus's crucifixion; it is also the anniversary of the martyrdom of Dr. Liu Zhanen, the president of Shanghai University. Jesus sacrificed for the people of the world, and Dr. Liu sacrificed for the country. Jesus sacrificed his life with the spirit of love. Although Jesus died one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight years ago, people all over the world still commemorate him; Dr. Liu was a believer in Jesus, and he was influenced by Jesus. With the spirit of Bo You [universal love], he managed education and transformed society. Dr. Liu's death is worth commemorating!

Dr. Liu often said three things to people in peacetime, and these three things are what he has been following throughout his life:

The first sentence is to be positive, not negative.

The second sentence is to cooperate, not destroy.

The third sentence is to sacrifice, not benefit oneself.

He also believes that only optimism can overcome pessimism, only observation can overcome negativity, and only Dongguan [Eastern View] can overcome difficulties! Therefore, he always uses a positive spirit and an optimistic attitude to overcome all difficulties in dealing with the world!

We Chinese people lack the ability to organize and lack the spirit of cooperation. When doing something, we are always too focused on the Phoenix and too focused on self-interest; often there are differences of opinion and mutual infighting, which leads to the destruction of things. Dr. Liu saw this and often shouted loudly to warn the people of the country.

Dr. Liu is already dead! But his positive thoughts, cooperative attitude, and spirit of sacrifice will never disappear. Today, we should certainly commemorate him and remember him: we should especially admire him and learn from him.

### The Importance and Improvement of Vocational Education for Refugees

— Gao Bujie

The general public in Shanghai who have come from Yi seem to have a very bad impression of refugees. One often hears people saying indignantly: "They eat and sleep, sleep and eat, they don't want to work even when there is work available, they don't want to earn money, and they can't even talk about enduring hardship. The nanny hired from the reception center by a certain mansion ran back after three days. The worker hired by a certain company from the reception center didn't want to work after two days… What is this? Refugees are simply becoming lazy people." Indeed, these are facts, which anyone who cares about the refugee issue can know. The reasons are: First, the staff in the reception centers are too irresponsible. Second, some of them are indeed gluttonous, lazy, and habitually lazy beggars and vagrants mixed in various reception centers. Third, most of the refugees, because they have suffered major disasters, their nerves have been overstimulated, they have lost their inherent rationality, they have no original self-confidence, they have no interest in life, and naturally they can't even talk about work. As a result, they sink into "sleeping and eating, eating and sleeping, not wanting to work even when there is work available, not wanting to earn money…"

Originally, this refugee relief is completely different from the usual charitable undertakings of running nursing homes, disability homes, and relief homes. First, most of the victims this time are good people with jobs and families, the backbone of the country and the nation. Second, this time the war zone is vast and there are many victims. At a time when all these material resources are concentrated on the great cause of resisting the war and building the country, the government certainly does not have huge sums of money to relieve refugees, and donations are inevitably exhausted due to the long war. Third, this destruction is severe and the disaster is serious. Most refugees have lost their fortunes and lost everything. Although current clothing, food, and housing are provided by relief and there are no temporary problems, how to maintain life after the war has become a serious problem. Therefore, this refugee relief is not only to passively supply the refugees with the materials to maintain their lingering lives, even if they have fulfilled their responsibilities, but also to turn passivity into activity, turn laziness into hard work, train the incompetent to have skills, enable the jobless to find employment, and finally enable these refugees who originally relied on others to gradually achieve self-sufficiency and self-reliance, to be useful people for resisting the war and building the country at present, and to be new people who can rely on their own efforts after the war.

How to achieve the above goals? In a word, actively promote vocational education for refugees. Vocational education for refugees is the most important part of refugee relief, and it is also the most fundamental part. If refugee relief ignores vocational education for refugees, it loses the meaning of relief. As a result, although refugees are slightly favored at present, it is not only of no benefit to the country and the nation, but also wastes a bit of power, aggravating the national crisis of resisting the war and building the country at present, and adding a group of lazy vagrants in the future. Only by actively promoting vocational education for refugees can we get to the point of relieving refugees.

In the past year, although the competent authorities of various reception centers in Shanghai also had vocational education facilities for refugees, most of them were perfunctory and did not pay attention to them, and the methods were improper and there was a lack of responsible people, so the results were minimal. The recent criticism of refugees by people in the society is a good proof. The author has been responsible for promoting vocational education for refugees in various reception centers in Shanghai for the past year, and has a lot of knowledge about vocational education for refugees. Now, despite my humble knowledge, I will briefly describe my humble opinions on the points that should be improved in vocational education for refugees in the future:

(1) Consolidate the administrative status and enrich the command power.

In the past, although the competent authorities of various reception centers also had the establishment of vocational education groups and production education groups, their status was low and they existed in name only. Although there were also personnel responsible for promoting it, they had no administrative power and could not issue orders to various reception centers. Therefore, most reception centers adopted a perfunctory attitude towards vocational education for refugees, and various plans and facilities of the superior authorities were often delayed and delayed again, and the results were not achieved after several weeks. For example: to organize a certain production work in a certain reception center, please ask the center to select a number of refugees for training. At first, they agreed readily, but later, they said that the place was too small, or that the wages were too low, or that the refugees were unwilling to learn, and so on. Although the promoters tried their best, the result was still nothing. For this situation, the administrators who bear this responsibility should be given appropriate punishment, either a warning, a demerit, or a dismissal, but because the administrative status of vocational education for refugees itself is low, the promoters certainly have no right to perform this task. Therefore, in the future, vocational education for refugees should establish special departments in the administrative organization of the competent authorities of various reception centers to establish their status, and detailed measures must be formulated to enrich the command power. This is the most important point.

(2) Increase staff and implement division of labor and cooperation.

The scope of vocational education for refugees is extremely broad, including vocational surveys, vocational introductions, vocational training, vocational guidance, and sales of products. And the content of each job is extremely complex. For example: Vocational training includes procedures such as collecting workers, registering, finding locations, planning funding, and hiring technicians. Another example is vocational introduction, which also includes procedures such as soliciting, registering, and contacting. Since the work of vocational education for refugees is so heavy, it is certainly impossible for one or two people to do everything. However, the competent authorities of various reception centers have made this mistake. Investigation, introduction, training, supervision, and sales are all pushed on the shoulders of one or two promoters. There are so many refugee centers in Shanghai, the places where they are located are so scattered, and the need for vocational education is so urgent. Today, training is organized, tomorrow, introduction is organized, today, we run to the refugee centers, tomorrow, we run to various factories, here and there, this and that, how can one or two people handle it? Children account for only one-tenth or two-tenths of the total number of refugees, but there are dozens of people responsible for promoting education for children, while there are no less than fifty or sixty thousand adult refugees who need vocational education, and only one or two people are responsible for promoting it (taking the International Education Committee of the Red Cross as an example), or even none at all, and other personnel work part-time. How can such a method produce results? Therefore, increasing staff is the current urgent task of promoting vocational education for refugees. Moreover, it is necessary to clearly define and properly allocate who is responsible for what position, and resolutely implement division of labor and cooperation to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

(3) Each reception center should establish a special vocational education department and appoint full-time personnel.

In the past, the competent authorities paid little attention to vocational education for refugees, so it had no status in the reception centers, and its organization was mostly subordinate to the management system, without specialized personnel responsible for it. Only a very few reception centers have production managers, but their job is only to collect production commissions every day. Therefore, whenever there is a contact, Zhang San pushes Li Si, and no one is willing to take full responsibility. The promotion of vocational education for refugees certainly depends on the planning and supervision of the competent authorities, but the practical cooperation and serious handling of various reception centers are even more important. Therefore, in the future, each reception center should set up vocational education departments like management, supply, hygiene, and general affairs, and designate specialized personnel to promote it.

(4) Raise fixed funds.

Funding is the mother of a career. With funding, the career can be promoted smoothly and developed rapidly, otherwise, even if the people are good, there will be many difficulties. The refugee reception center itself is a group that is being rescued, and naturally has funding to run various production undertakings. Therefore, the funds for all production undertakings in various reception centers should be planned and managed by the competent authorities in a unified manner. Once this funding is raised, it is not allowed to be used for other purposes, and is specifically used for vocational education facilities for refugees. In the past, various reception centers requested the competent authorities to help because they wanted to run production undertakings, but they often could not be realized because there was no fixed funding, which is a pity.

(5) Conduct more vocational training.

In the past, vocational education for refugees focused on introduction, and training work was rarely organized due to limited funding. However, after "August 13th," various factories and shops closed down, tightened their belts, and there were unemployed people everywhere. Under this situation, it is of course impossible to introduce a large number of jobs to refugees. Therefore, in the past year, less than two-tenths of the hundreds of thousands of refugees have been able to find work. In the future, various training classes must be organized, such as straw weaving training, knitting training, sewing training, barber training, printing worker training, automobile driving and repair, radio transceiver, etc., to train specialized talents and open up employment opportunities. So that they can get production opportunities at present, and have the ability to be self-reliant after the war. It is really a win-win situation.

(6) Contact various parties more.

Vocational education for refugees is not an internal undertaking of the relief agency, but a part of the entire society. It is not only carried out in small reception centers, but also developed to the vast society. If vocational education for refugees is only carried out in circles in the reception centers, it will definitely be difficult to achieve the expected goals. Therefore, it is necessary to contact various parties and conduct it in various ways. In the future, the administrative authorities responsible for promoting vocational education for refugees should initiate the organization of a committee such as the Vocational Education Association for Refugees, contact various industry groups in Shanghai, hold regular meetings, exchange opinions more, and jointly discuss promotion methods, so that it will not be in vain and achieve nothing.

The above is only based on the author's experience in the past year. I offer my humble opinion. Whether it is appropriate, I hope that high-ranking people will correct it!

(Editor's note: Mr. Bu Jie's opinions are very helpful for reference. The Aftercare Department of this Association held a meeting yesterday and discussed the vocational education of refugees for a long time. We were honored to have Mr. Pan Yangrao of the Vocational Education Society and leaders of the industry and commerce circles and journalists in this city to give us advice. We have recorded them and will start implementing them. As for the issue of raising fixed funds, Mr. Xi Yushu, a director of this Association, and others have worked hard for half a month and raised a certain amount, which is stored for future use. If people from all walks of life can give us advice and cooperate with us from time to time, the refugee problem will definitely be properly solved.)

### Introducing Refugee Occupations

— Self-reliance

Capable refugees should register.

It is appropriate for those who have been affected by the war and whose family property has been reduced to ashes and who have no way to make a living to live in reception centers as refugees and to be supported by charitable organizations. If there is no food, rice will be sent. If there is no clothing, clothes will be sent. Although it is not eating well and wearing well, it can always be said that there is no worry about freezing and starvation. However, the refugees in Shanghai should also think about where the food and clothing you eat and wear come from? Do they fall from the sky? Of course not. Everything you use is donated by enthusiastic people in the society. Now, there are many people who run around and solicit donations for you every day. There are many people who save expenses for you and plan to help you through savings methods. There are many people who take a commission on the operation to help you, and even many elementary school students are saving their candy expenses for you. Think about it, how precious is the sympathy of these people! They spend money, on the one hand, to maintain your lives, and on the other hand, they also want you to be able to stand on your own from a life of suffering, so as to reduce the burden on the country and society, and work together to seek welfare for the society.

Therefore, the Aftercare Department of the Refugee Relief Association will follow this idea to handle the aftercare affairs of refugees. Refugees who need to work can be introduced to occupations. The Aftercare Department is working on all kinds of things that can solve the refugee problem. Refugees should listen to it.

Now I will tell you about the vocational introduction methods of the Aftercare Department so that you can consider them.

(1) In order to improve the work efficiency of introducing refugee occupations, a vocational introduction group (hereinafter referred to as this group) is specially established in the Aftercare Department to handle refugee vocational introduction matters.

(2) The work of this group is listed as follows: (1) Registration, (2) Investigation, (3) Assessment, (4) Guidance, (5) Introduction, (6) Statistics, (7) Other related matters.

(3) In order to understand the work skills and employment needs of refugees, this group may establish registration offices in various reception centers or other appropriate locations. All refugees who request vocational introduction must first fill in the "Job Application Registration Form." Then, this group will send personnel to various reception centers to conduct on-site investigations when necessary to prevent fraud.

(4) This group should carefully assess the skills of job-seeking refugees before introduction to avoid incompetence and being dismissed. The standards and methods of assessment will be formulated separately.

(5) For refugees who have passed the assessment, in addition to being advertised in newspapers or letters to various industries and businesses to employ them as much as possible, this association will also publish the "Vocational Introduction Column of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association" in various newspapers, summarizing their number, skills, desired type of work, and desired treatment.

(6) When there is a need for job-seeking refugees, this group will introduce them separately. If the introduction is successful, this group should give practical guidance on the matters to be paid attention to when employed, and ask them to fill out two copies of the "Volunteer Form." Paste a photo on the Volunteer Form, one copy to be kept by this association and one copy to be given to the employer.

(7) For refugees who are introduced to work by this association, a probationary period of one to three months is temporarily set. During the probationary period, the employer only provides meals or board and lodging, and does not pay wages.

(8) In order to encourage refugees to find employment, this association may provide transportation subsidies to refugees introduced by this association during the probationary period, up to one yuan per person per month.

(9) Refugees who are introduced to work by this association and whose wages are sufficient to maintain the entire life of their families should be ordered to move out of the reception center. Those who can only maintain part of their families should also be classified as self-sufficient reception centers and live separately from other refugees.

(10) Refugees who are introduced to occupations and refuse to work without legitimate reasons, or who abandon themselves after being introduced to work, resulting in dismissal, or who voluntarily quit without legitimate reasons, should be expelled from the center by this association, and all reception centers should be notified to refuse to accommodate them. Those who have left the center because they have found employment will no longer be accommodated.

### I Am a Refugee

— Refugee Reporter

I am a refugee, we are all refugees.

In the past, we were clerks in the pawnshops of our uncles on our mother's side, in the shops of our uncles, and in the stacks of our cousins.

When there was something to do, we dealt with it lazily and perfunctorily; when there was nothing to do, we talked and chatted. Not visiting prostitutes or gambling was already a decent person.

I regret it very much. At that time, I had the brains but did not study, and I had the hands and feet but did not work. I only knew how to live a leisurely life.

When the gunfire rang, the pawnshops, shops, and machine rooms of our relatives closed their doors, leaving us, the incompetent and unlearned, with no way to eat.

Now, we have learned a profound lesson: "A person should rely on himself, and only himself is the most reliable."

### Offering Flowers on Qingming Festival

(Chen Xiuying, 14-year-old, Junior High School Year 3)

The willows are sprouting again,

The grass is turning green from yellow;

In this extraordinary year,

Qingming Festival has come again;

In a quiet village,

In the open space with mounds upon mounds,

The stream flows murmuringly,

The birds are chirping non-stop,

A beautiful girl,

Stands in front of the mounds,

She quietly holds fresh flowers,

And smiles slightly at the tombs of those nameless heroes;

This year's Qingming Festival

She can offer her inner enthusiasm,

To replace what she used to do in the past:

Using wine and dishes to worship the tombs of those meaningless ancestors;

Using wine and dishes to worship the tombs of those meaningless ancestors:

She gently says:

Warriors!

These are pure white plum blossoms,

Symbolizing your white horses;

These are bright red peach blossoms,

Symbolizing your fresh blood;

Don't worry about your deaths,

Because we are still advancing wave upon wave;

Don't worry about your hometowns,

Because they will be recovered soon;

Here—rest in peace with a smile!

We will always remember you,

Because you will sacrifice yourselves for our wounds,

We do not bring tears and sorrow,

But bring glory and hope;

Here—rest in peace with a smile!

The victory of the Republic of China is not far away!

### Song of the Big Tree

— Wei Hua

My body is big,

My age is high;

The gale shakes my head for me,

The torrential rain washes me.

In spring, I put on a green hat,

In winter, I am more vigorous in the frost,

In summer and autumn, the scorching sun is as red as fire,

It is good to be carefree under the shade of the tree.

Farmers and woodcutters talk and laugh,

Children jump and run together.

They all say to me:

"Only big trees are really good!"

In the autumn of the year before last,

Savages came together.

Without asking east or west,

They recklessly chopped down my branches.

Although my body is big and I am not afraid of chopping,

The anger in my heart is burning like fire.

I said: "You come and chop!

Next year I will definitely be more vigorous,

You chop one branch and ten branches will grow.

Let's see how much strength you have!"

### Weekly War Situation

— Wu Guang

Northern Jiangxi

The battles this week were all fierce. The Japanese army exhausted its naval, land, and air forces, and launched fierce attacks in several directions. However, the entire Chinese army, under the command of the Supreme Commander, fought bravely to resist. The losses given to the Japanese army in the past week were truly great. The efficiency of the attrition warfare was brought into full play. According to Japanese news, the war in northern Jiangxi has never been seen since the Battle of Wuhan. It was found that since the Japanese army attacked Duchang and Wucheng on both sides of Poyang Lake last week, its fierce offensive was frustrated after being countered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army then continued its strategic battle, sending tens of thousands of troops to attack Wuning and Nanchang. The Japanese army attacking Wuning advanced from Ruoxi in two routes, one route westward and one route southward. The Chinese army counterattacked and bravely attacked the Japanese army on Hushan Changgang. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly from a high position. After a fierce battle, the Japanese line collapsed and fled towards Wuning. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue and approached the Wuning city wall. The Japanese army attacking Nanchang, at first, in Gouziling, Manshoushan, Fengxin area, fought bravely with the Chinese army against fierce artillery fire and poison gas, and more than 2,000 Japanese officers and soldiers below the captain of the Iino Regiment were killed. In the Battle of Fengxin, the Miyazaki Regiment Commander also died one after another. However, the losses on the Chinese side were also considerable. According to reports a few days ago, the Japanese army has advanced and occupied Nanchang. The Chinese side, in order to continue its task of attrition warfare, has shifted its front and continued to launch the war, so it launched a full-scale counterattack. Therefore, the Japanese army in Nanchang has always been blocked north of Liantang and has made no progress. In the Gaoan area, the Chinese and Japanese armies launched bloody battles in Zhanggu Fuxiangguan Shanzili and other places one after another. The Japanese army suffered considerable losses under the fierce artillery fire of the Chinese side. As of the morning of the 3rd, it had not subsided. The Chinese side has moved into a self-serving area because the task of attrition has been achieved.

Guangdong

There have been no changes along the Yuehan, Guangjiu, and Guangshen lines. More than 2,000 Japanese troops attacking Shaping from Jiujiang, more than 20 tanks, and airplanes and poison gas were added. The Japanese unit commander, Zhishi Songdi, personally commanded. The momentum was very fierce. The Chinese army fought fiercely with them in Huangsaikeng and Zhuangyuanshan. At the same time, the Japanese army landed from Beijie and attacked Jiangmen from two routes, attempting to realize the plan to break through Zhongshan. According to reports, Shaping, Beijie, and Jiangmen were once lost. Later, Hua Cheng launched a large-scale counterattack with the spirit of certain death, and completely repelled the Japanese army. Only more than 100 Japanese troops fled to Jiujiang. The remnants are still being mopped up. The Japanese warships on the Fangcheng Sea in the south once used air firepower to cover the landing in Qisha, but they failed to succeed after being fiercely swept by the Chinese garrison. Now the sea is calm and nothing is happening. Also, hundreds of Japanese troops in Ding'an, Hainan Island, equipped with many tanks, advanced from Leiming City to Yidi, and also encountered fierce fighting from the Chinese side. The Japanese army was unable to support it and finally collapsed towards Stability. The Chinese army also tracked and entered Leiming City.

Shanxi

The Japanese army in the Anyi, Yuncheng, and Yongji areas of southern Shanxi launched fierce attacks on the Zhongtiao Mountain positions in several routes this week. One route of more than 2,000 Japanese troops advanced towards Dachen Village, one route of more than 2,000 Japanese troops attacked Monanzhen, and another route of more than 1,000 Japanese troops attacked Nanwei Village. Each route had Japanese aircraft to assist in the battle, attempting to spy on the important strongholds of Maojindu and Pinglu, which was very active. The Chinese army relied on the favorable terrain to launch fierce counterattacks, fighting back and forth, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented in that area. Dachen Village, Monanzhen, and Nanwei Village were lost and regained several times. In the end, due to the brave and bloody battles of the Chinese side, the areas were still held by China. In this battle, the Japanese side lost more than 1,000 people and shot down one Japanese plane. The main force of the Japanese army has been hit, so the momentum in Maojindu Pinglu and other places is even stronger.
