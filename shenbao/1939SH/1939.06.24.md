### Fierce Fighting in the Eastern Suburbs of Swatow; China Dispatches Large Reinforcements in Three Routes; Street Fighting in the City Has Not Stopped; Japanese Planes Continue Bombing; Japanese Troops Attacking the Port Are Repelled; Meixi Has Been Recaptured

(Hong Kong) Xingning Telegraph, after the Chinese army retreated from Swatow, they are now defending the line from Anbu to Jinsha City, forming an encirclement of Swatow together with Chaoyang to the west. The Japanese have transported over a thousand cavalrymen and many armored vehicles, attempting to cut off the main eastern route of the Chinese army. Yesterday, there was fierce fighting in Anbu, with heavy casualties on the Japanese side. The Chinese side has dispatched large reinforcements in three routes. (23rd Special Dispatch)

Chao'an: The Chinese army's assault troops recaptured Anbu and Meixi on the evening of the 23rd. Currently, both sides are in a stalemate in Caitang, west of Anbu. (23rd Telegraph)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the fighting in the eastern suburbs of Swatow, around the airfield, is still extremely fierce, with heavy Japanese casualties. Unless further reinforcements are sent, it will be difficult for the Japanese to advance. Not only in the suburbs of Swatow, but the fighting remains in a stalemate. At the same time, street fighting is also taking place in Swatow city. The Chinese army is using sturdy steel-reinforced concrete buildings as fortresses, placing machine guns in key locations to resist. Therefore, Japanese planes are still heavily bombing Swatow. Also, it is reported that Japanese troops sailing up the Han River in motorboats to Anbu attempted to land there and advance westward, but after a night of fierce fighting, the Japanese finally retreated. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)

(Chongqing) Today, this office received news from Chinese sources that Chinese and Japanese troops are currently fighting in the eastern suburbs of Swatow and near the airfield. The telephone line between Swatow and Chaozhou was still open at 10:00 PM on June 21st. Furthermore, according to a Chinese telegram issued at 6:00 AM yesterday, the Chinese army in Swatow is still defending the city's inner and outer positions. It was then learned that they are engaged in street fighting with the Japanese. Yesterday, over forty Japanese planes took turns bombing Swatow twelve times until 9:00 PM last night, still circling over Swatow and dropping bombs. At the same time, another group of Japanese troops advanced along the Han River (transliterated) in motorboats, reaching Anbu, twelve miles north of Swatow. (23rd Reuters Telegraph)

Chao'an: After withdrawing from Anbu on the morning of the 23rd, the Chinese army in Swatow deployed defenses in the northwestern suburbs. At around 10:00 AM, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack, and gunfire erupted again. The Japanese, not daring to linger, retreated to the streets, and the fighting subsided. There was peace and quiet north of Anbu. (23rd Telegraph)

(Chongqing) According to reports, the Japanese army forcibly landed near Swatow on the morning of the previous day, under the cover of airplanes and warships, and advanced towards the city in an encirclement. The Chinese garrison bravely resisted, and the fierce fighting is still ongoing. To understand the battle situation and the Japanese intentions, reporters visited the military authorities and inquired about everything. According to the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, the Japanese army's invasion of Swatow was expected, and the Chinese army had already made preparations and deployed defenses in the area, giving the landed Japanese army an unexpected blow. They are now concentrating their forces and fighting fiercely with them near Swatow, striving to achieve the predetermined goal of depleting the Japanese army. As for the Japanese army's occupation of Swatow, it has no value in terms of military significance. Its main intention is not military but economic, allowing them to seize the interests of various countries along the Pacific coast and eliminate the influence of Europe and the United States in China, thereby fulfilling their ambition to dominate East Asia. In short, the fact that the Japanese army recently does not dare to penetrate deep into the interior but only harasses the coastal ports is enough to prove that it is a kind of struggle in a deep predicament. The Chinese army is determined to give the Japanese army a heavy blow according to the predetermined plan and promote its early collapse. (23rd Telegraph)

Chao'an: The Japanese army invading Swatow advanced in four routes on the 22nd. (1) Advancing from Donghu to Dahao, they encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army, and many Japanese soldiers were killed. Subsequently, the Japanese army sent hundreds of reinforcements and bombarded with concentrated artillery fire. Due to terrain constraints, the Chinese army shifted to the west bank of Dahao in the evening and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese. (2) Over six hundred Japanese troops advanced from Sijiwei and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the Xincun and Yangcun areas (four or five li northwest of Sijiwei). (3) In the Qilu airfield area in the eastern district of Swatow, although the Japanese army launched a combined attack by land, sea, and air, the Chinese army still held its positions, and the Japanese army could not advance an inch. Swatow was still in the hands of the Chinese army until 8:00 PM. (4) The Japanese infantry and cavalry, which had repeatedly detoured to attack Anbu, were met with a head-on blow from the Chinese army and retreated. They then launched an attack along the river with over twenty small motorboats carrying hundreds of Japanese soldiers at around 11:00 PM on the 22nd, and were intercepted by the Chinese army in Meixi (east of Anbu), where a mixed battle broke out. (23rd Telegraph)

(Hong Kong) According to news from Swatow today, Swatow is now peaceful, and some Chinese people have returned to the city. Foreigners are also safe. Furthermore, according to refugees who arrived here from Swatow today, an air raid alarm occurred in Swatow at 4:30 AM on the 21st, when seventeen Japanese planes heavily bombed the defensive areas around Swatow until 6:00 AM. At the lighthouse on Bread Island (transliterated), the Japanese flag was raised. By 9:00 AM, seven Japanese warships appeared in the harbor, increasing to ten by 10:00 AM, all anchored opposite the Mobil Oil depot and fiercely bombarding Swatow. Many shrapnel shells fell at the Mobil Oil depot, and a Syrian employee was injured by the shrapnel. By 10:45 AM, two fires had started in the city, obviously the result of Japanese naval bombardment. At 6:00 PM, the Chinese side blew up the waterworks. It is said that at that time, the Japanese army had advanced to the suburbs of Swatow, and subsequently, small teams of Japanese troops invaded. The entire city fell the next morning. At this time, the American warship "USS Pillsbury" was berthed at Mobil Oil's No. 2 buoy. No marines from other countries landed. On Thursday afternoon, the American warship "USS Pope" arrived in Swatow, and the captain visited the senior Japanese officer. After that, Swatow became very peaceful. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)

(Swatow) The Japanese army occupied Swatow at dawn today, amidst a city-wide fire caused by the Chinese scorched-earth policy. Last night, the city was ablaze, illuminating miles around, and many warehouses and buildings were razed to the ground. The Chinese army further destroyed the waterworks before retreating. So far, there have been no reports of harm to the lives and property of foreigners. (23rd Reuters Telegraph)

(Chongqing) Because after the fall of Swatow, almost all of China's important eastern seaports, except for Ningbo, have fallen into Japanese hands, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to prevent the Japanese from using these ports to promote the sale of Japanese goods, has collected all the trademarks of Japanese goods, compiled them into a book, and approved its distribution to anti-Japanese goods organizations across the country for detailed identification so that they can effectively boycott Japanese goods. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)

If the Japanese Army Attempts to Invade the Interior, It Will Suffer a Major Setback

(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily News editorial today stated that the Japanese army, having failed on various fronts, decided to land in Swatow to divert international and domestic attention. It should be known that the Japanese army's landing in Swatow is not an action to expand their offensive in China, but rather exposes Japan's weakness. The Japanese army's offensives in northern Hunan, southern Hubei, and southern Shanxi have already failed, and the end of the war is nowhere in sight. Therefore, they decided to take this action. The Chinese military authorities in the Swatow-Chaozhou area have made the necessary military preparations. With the help of Japanese warships and airplanes, they may be able to land along the coast, but to achieve their goals, they will inevitably make major sacrifices. If the Japanese army attempts to invade the interior, their adventurous actions will be severely punished. The mountains west of Swatow are continuous, and the Cantonese are also known as excellent soldiers. In recent months, the villagers in the Swatow-Chaozhou area have been organized, trained, and armed to prevent any unforeseen events. These strong self-defense groups will provide the most resolute resistance to the Japanese invasion. (23rd Reuters Telegraph)

(Paris) Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun told reporters yesterday that the Japanese army's occupation of Swatow will not affect the future of the Sino-Japanese war. Gu stated that the number of Chinese military supplies imported into the interior through Swatow was very small. The Japanese army's occupation of Swatow is still far from achieving a "European-style" victory. He said that the news of the Japanese army's victory is heavily publicized in the newspapers, but because of the proper use of guerrilla tactics by the Chinese army, the prolongation of the war and the depletion of the Japanese army's capabilities are not hindered. He said, "The Japanese army's actions against Swatow are undoubtedly a prelude to the Japanese army's actions against Hong Kong. The Japanese army feels that the time has come for actions against Hong Kong and can launch them at any time." (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)

British Naval Authorities Order Resumption of Hong Kong-Swatow Shipping

(Hong Kong) The British naval authorities here have advised British shipping companies to resume the Swatow route. Although the Japanese have requested that foreign ships not enter the port of Swatow, the British authorities do not recognize this blockade. The British gunboat HMS Gannet and the destroyer HMS Scout are currently stationed in the port of Swatow to protect British ships from interference by others. The American warship USS Pillsbury and the USS Pope are also currently in Swatow. The destroyer HMS Ashville has already sailed to Gulangyu today but is prepared to sail to Swatow if necessary. When the British ship SS Falaminia arrived in Hong Kong this morning, Reuters reporters boarded the ship and saw that only two British women, one American woman, and three children had been evacuated from Swatow. However, the ship carried 300 Chinese refugees, some of whom were British citizens. (23rd Reuters Telegraph)

(Hong Kong) According to official sources here today, the blockade implemented by the Japanese army in Swatow is not recognized by the British side. Therefore, the British naval authorities have asked British ships to continue sailing to Swatow for trade. This indicates that the British side is determined to break the Japanese blockade. Because the British navy has already issued this advice, Jardine Matheson's "Foshan" and Swire's "Jiangsu" are scheduled to sail to Swatow on Sunday. At the same time, no American expatriates have yet evacuated. Although the British naval authorities are currently maintaining silence, many officers believe that the British and American response to the Japanese blockade of Swatow is clearly very strong. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)

(Hong Kong) Today, all newspapers here published the news that Britain refused to recognize the Japanese blockade of Swatow as legitimate with large headlines. It is reported that the British authorities notified all British ships to maintain shipping routes to Swatow as usual. Today, the British ship "Foshan" is the first ship to sail to Swatow in accordance with this notification. The second British ship is scheduled to sail to Swatow on Sunday. (23rd Haitong Press Telegraph)

(Hong Kong) The first batch of foreign women and children evacuated from Swatow arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 23rd. The British naval authorities ordered British ships to continue sailing between Hong Kong and Swatow, and refused to recognize the Japanese blockade of Swatow. (23rd Telegraph)

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons that the British authorities, with the cooperation of the Japanese side, are prepared to evacuate all British women and children stationed in Swatow. Chamberlain warned that Britain intends to take any necessary measures to deal with Japan's request that all foreign warships withdraw from Swatow. The British government is "extremely concerned" about Japan's demands. When asked about "the Japanese invasion of foreign interests in China is our attempt to dominate the Far East," he replied, "I hope it will not be so." Previously, Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Foreign Secretary Halifax and the leaders of the French land, sea, and air forces to consider the new actions of the Japanese army in China. A British government spokesperson declared that if Japan continues its anti-British policy, "Britain will naturally take countermeasures. Britain's position cannot remain unclear for long." At this time, the British government is in constant contact with the United States regarding the events in China. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)

(London) Regarding the situation in the port of Swatow, China, naval circles here recently declared that the Japanese naval authorities in China had "requested" that ships of all countries leave the port, but did not issue an ultimatum. This will definitely be rejected by Britain. In addition, the interests of Britain and the United States in the port of Swatow are the same, and Britain's attitude is even more firm. In short, since British ships are in the port, they will definitely stay there. (22nd Havas Telegraph)

The United States Sends More Warships to Swatow to Protect Expatriates

(Washington) The commander-in-chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, telegraphed Washington last night that he had refused Japan's request that U.S. warships withdraw from Swatow. Yarnell telegraphed Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, that he had notified Japan that the United States would protect American citizens wherever necessary. Yarnell's note to the Japanese Navy declared, "He will strive to fulfill his mission in a way that avoids interfering with Japanese military operations." The note was submitted by U.S. Consul General Gauss in Shanghai. U.S. naval circles here solemnly stated that Admiral Yarnell's declaration was a reiteration of his declaration in 1937, when he declared that U.S. warships had the right to protect American interests in China wherever and whenever necessary and intended to continue to do so. U.S. Consul in Swatow, Mr. Young, reported to the State Department that the 48 American expatriates in Swatow were all safe. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)

(Hong Kong) Since the Japanese ultimatum was issued yesterday, in addition to the British warship HMS "Tern" and the American warship USS "Pillsbury" already in Swatow, two more foreign warships have sailed into the port of Swatow, namely the American warship USS "Pope" and the British warship HMS "Scout." It is reported that after the Japanese army occupied Swatow, they appointed Chen Juemin as the chairman of the maintenance committee. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for Weir & Hanbury Steamship Company, the Japanese tried to land at the company's wharf yesterday, mistaking it for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharf. The company informed them that this was not the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharf but the property of Weir & Hanbury, and if the Japanese army wanted to land here, it would be regarded as a violation of foreign interests, and a protest would be lodged. At that point, the Japanese gave up. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)

(Washington) Regarding the Japanese naval authorities' request that American warships withdraw from the port of Swatow, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell has refused. The full text of the reply, which was forwarded to the Japanese side by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, has recently been published here, stating that "The Japanese authorities have announced that their navy will begin operations against the port of Swatow, China, and have notified foreign nationals and warships to leave the port. Regarding this matter, please inform the Japanese Consul in Shanghai to convey to the senior authorities of their navy that the duty of the United States warships in the Far East is primarily to protect American nationals. Wherever there is a need, American warships will sail to that place. In short, as long as American expatriates in China need protection and assistance, American warships will remain in Chinese ports." George's Democratic Congressman Vincent (Chairman of the House Naval Committee) recently commented, "I fully agree with Admiral Yarnell's reply. As long as American citizens reside in a place, the government is responsible for their protection." Otawa's Republican Congressman Volis declared, "I believe that if we can hold out to the end, Japan will eventually back down." (22nd Havas Telegraph)

(Washington) The Navy Department recently confirmed that the Japanese naval authorities requested that American warships leave the port of Swatow, which was rejected by Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet. It also learned that the American destroyer USS "Pillsbury" not only did not intend to leave the port of Swatow, as requested by the Japanese, but another destroyer, USS "Pope," had just sailed into the port of Swatow. (21st Havas Telegraph)

Japanese Foreign Ministry's Attitude Gradually Softens

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared today that Japan's warning to all countries to evacuate Swatow was a "friendly suggestion," not an ultimatum as claimed by foreign newspapers. The Japanese naval authorities believed that under the current circumstances, it was necessary for foreign warships to leave Swatow to avoid unfortunate incidents. In fact, advising foreign warships to leave Swatow does not mean that foreign ships are not allowed to dock at Swatow. (23rd Haitong Press Telegraph)

(London) According to Japanese officials here, the Japanese Navy will no longer demand that foreign warships leave Swatow. According to a Japanese spokesperson to an Associated Press reporter, this decision by the Japanese side "request" has been "misunderstood." The Japanese said that the purpose of asking foreign warships to leave Swatow was to avoid accidents due to excessive crowding in the port. When asked if the Japanese side had softened its stance due to the rejection of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Japanese spokesman considered it inaccurate.

Editorial

### An Analytical View of the Swatow Landing

This newspaper has yet to comment on the Japanese army's landing in Swatow, China. Although Swatow is a Chinese seaport, it is far from the main battlefields, and transportation is difficult. Foreign ships are also subject to inspection by Japanese warships. Therefore, it has never been used as a route for importing military supplies, and its gains and losses are irrelevant to military transport. The decisive battle between China and Japan will certainly not take place along the coast. Economically speaking, although those who depend on Swatow for their livelihood are not few, China's vitality is based on the interior. The restriction of foreign exchange and foreign goods is intended to preserve national strength, and we are working tirelessly to do so. Therefore, the fall of the seaport will help to strengthen the restriction and promote domestic production. From the perspective of the overall war of resistance, Swatow is insignificant. However, the international arena is quite disturbed by Swatow. In general, public opinion in Britain, France, and the United States sees this as a new stimulus. Germany and Italy are advocating for Japan, extravagantly presenting it as a great harvest. The Japanese army is also "listening to the news" and claiming how valuable it is militarily, economically, and politically. Of course, the gains and losses of a city or a pool of water cannot be dismissed as nothing. But to say that the gains and losses of Swatow will have much impact is an exaggeration. Japan, taking advantage of its strengths in the sea and air, took this coastal pocket-sized area, which is said to be as easy as taking something out of a bag. But they waited nearly two years after the start of the war to do so, which is enough to prove that it had little significance in the first place. However, on the Japanese side, they have some success to boast about. And since it has only been three days, they have fully achieved what they sought, "seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence." What they seek is not this city or this pool of water, for it is a scorched earth, and what good is it to obtain it? Nor is it in military, economic, or political terms, for to say this has any value or meaning is deceptive. What they seek is propaganda material, and now they have obtained it, and they are also publicizing it as much as possible, internally to comfort their soldiers and civilians, and externally to dazzle Britain, France, the United States, Germany, and Italy. This is their success, and it cannot be denied.

Why do they seek propaganda material to comfort their soldiers and civilians? Why do they seek current propaganda material and increase their current dispersion of military strength, and the worry that isolated troops will be difficult to protect in the future? This is not what we want to explain in detail. In short, in the past month, they have lost soldiers in western Shanxi and generals in northern Hubei, and propaganda material is indeed difficult to obtain. Therefore, seeking it in Swatow has its own difficulties. Moreover, it can also be used to dazzle other countries, which is a double win. But why dazzle other countries? This has two meanings. Japan and the German-Italian Axis share the same bed but have different dreams, and their alliance is only superficial. What Germany and Italy want most from Japan is that when war breaks out in Europe, Japan will use all its naval, land, and air forces to stand on the same front as Germany and Italy. Otherwise, Germany and Italy have no use for Japan. What Japan fears most is the United States at sea, and it cannot help Japan resist the United States, so it can only curry favor with the United States. On land, it is the Soviet Union, and it is willing to ally with Germany and Italy to defend against the Soviet Union. Other than that, it does not want to be bound to Germany and Italy because of the future changes in Europe, and only be a tool for Germany and Italy. The theory of a tripartite military alliance, although it has been promoted in many ways, has not been agreed upon in the end, because Japan and Germany and Italy have different wishes. However, as the international situation gradually becomes unfavorable to Japan, it seeks to collude with Germany and Italy in order to avoid being dragged into the European vortex, and does not want to conclude a broad military alliance with Germany and Italy. At the same time, it urgently needs Germany and Italy to support it in order to deal specifically with the Far East and the Soviet Union, and to form some kind of agreement. Therefore, due to the contradiction of conditions, it is necessary to dazzle Germany and Italy with certain things so that Germany and Italy can recognize what Japan is doing in the Far East, which is indirectly beneficial to Germany and Italy's activities in Europe, in order to promote Germany and Italy to accept Japan's proposal for a tripartite alliance. Their blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin and their landing in Swatow have this meaning. This is one. The international maneuvering and bargaining are unpredictable. Therefore, while each country is doing its best to enhance its own strength as the basis for victory, it is also creating all kinds of threatening false noises in the hope of winning outside of strength. Although rational people judge that false noises are ineffective, so far, no one dares to assert that cowards will certainly not succumb to false noises. For this reason, although Britain, France, and the United States have shown a strong response after the Japanese army landed in Swatow, at the beginning of the Japanese landing, they fully expected Britain, France, and the United States to be overwhelmed by the threat and gradually soften their stance. The inverted acts in northern Tianjin and southern Swatow have intensified, dazzling Britain, France, and the United States with the determination to attack. This is the second.

In this situation, we firmly believe that Britain, France, and the United States will not change their policies under threat, so we can assert that Japan's false noise and threats are futile. However, we also believe that Japan will not abandon its aggression because of other countries' expressions of disgust, so we can assert that the empty protests of Britain, France, and the United States are ineffective! As for the judgment of fate, it depends only on the action of strength. There is no doubt that Japan's strength is insufficient to win. But as long as they arrange things step by step without rushing to catch up and make an effective response, there is a possibility that there will be some kind of unexpected change, which may cause other countries to be caught off guard and suffer its poison. For example, using Hainan Island to target Vietnam, using Swatow to spy on Hong Kong, all of today's seemingly false noise and threats can be used unexpectedly in the event of a one-in-ten-thousand chance. This is what should be paid attention to.

### Concerning the Situation in the Tianjin Concessions, the Puppet Authorities Make Four Demands, Presented to the British and French Embassies, Including Political and Monetary Issues, a Large Anti-British, Anti-Communist Meeting is Held in Peiping, Participants Show No Interest

(Tianjin) It was learned here today that the "Provisional Government" of Peiping has presented the British and French embassies with the following four demands regarding the situation in the foreign concessions of Tianjin: Terrorists and communists in the concessions should be extradited immediately; cooperation must extend to the "Provisional Government's" monetary policy, including banning the circulation of banknotes of the National Government and assisting in the transfer of the National Government's reserves within the British concession; inspecting Chinese banks, money shops, and stores in the British concession; and suppressing all actions and expressions of opinion that violate the "Provisional Government's" policies. It is reported that the British consular authorities received a letter from the "Mayor" of Tianjin on June 22, enclosing a draft of the "Provisional Government's" letter to the British and French embassies presenting the above demands. It is also reported that the French consular authorities received the same letter, warning that if the concession authorities tolerate any disturbances caused by the Chiang Kai-shek regime, the "Provisional Government" will have to investigate the root of the problem and take necessary steps. The British warship HMS Lowestoft (990 tons) arrived in Beidaihe today and is said to be heading to Shanhaiguan, and the HMS Dainty will also visit Qinhuangdao. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Peiping) The anti-British, anti-communist meeting held here today was clearly a failure. Although there were as many as 3,000 Chinese participants, the Japanese propagandists, despite their earnest speeches, were met with indifference from the audience, who showed no interest. Many did not even sing along to the anti-British songs prepared by the organizers. Most of the participants were schoolchildren who did not understand the fiery anti-British and anti-communist speeches, so they simply played around. As for the older attendees, most were indifferent good-natured people with no anti-British or anti-communist sentiments. Therefore, although the Japanese propagandists passionately advocated a hard line against Britain and communism, there was no enthusiastic response from the audience below, and very few joined in the singing. However, many anti-British slogans were indeed posted on the walls of the Forbidden City, stating that the current Sino-Japanese war was entirely instigated by the British and advocating the recovery of the concessions. At the same time, propaganda teams were singing anti-British songs in various parts of the city. It is also reported that similar anti-British gatherings are being held in the surrounding rural areas. (Associated Press, 23rd)

(London) According to Japanese official sources here last night, the Tianjin issue has now escalated. In addition to demanding that the British extradite the four Chinese to the Japanese side, the Japanese government will also demand that the British authorities transfer the Chinese funds held in the British concession to the "Joint Reserve" bank. Unless the latter demand is also accepted by the British side, the Japanese side will not lift the blockade. The Japanese side also accused the British side of preventing them from circulating the new currency system in North China. (Associated Press, 23rd)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin reports that there is still no communication between the British authorities in Tianjin and the Japanese side. Observers believe that although the Japanese military unanimously advocates a hard line against Britain, there seems to be no room for negotiation. However, Japanese merchants in Tianjin all hope for an early resolution. It is reported that before implementing the blockade, the Japanese military notified all merchants to completely move their goods out of the concessions, but very few actually complied. Because Japanese merchants' goods are all under control in the country, they hoard a large amount of goods in Tianjin, but there are few warehouses in the city, so the inventory is concentrated in the British and French concessions. Currently, the warehouses of the International Transportation Company, Hebei Provincial Bank, and others are piled high with goods. Merchants are extremely dissatisfied with the military blockade due to the suspension of trade. (23rd dispatch)

### The Far Eastern Situation Under Review, If Japan Persists in Aggressive Attitude, the US Will Take Stern Measures, If It Does Not Completely Withdraw from the Far East, It Must Resist Firmly, Japan Should Understand That the US Will Not Overlook the Tianjin Affair, Newspapers All Say That US Cooperation is Necessary to Curb Japan's Ambitions

(Washington) The Far Eastern situation is currently under intense study by the relevant authorities here, and newspapers are discussing effective actions to deal with Japan. Although the press refuses to consider resorting to war, various forms of economic pressure, such as boycotting Japanese goods, ceasing trade with Japan, or even implementing a blockade, seem to be generally supported. In general, American public opinion may have various prejudices regarding European events and is unwilling to actively cooperate with democratic countries, but in the Far East, concerns are much reduced. A senior official close to the White House recently made informal remarks, stating, "It is true that the protests made by the United States to Japan have been worded mildly, and efforts have also been made to promote a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident, but if Japan persists in its aggressive attitude, the United States is very likely to take stern measures to make it respect American rights in China. Government officials acknowledge that the significance of the incidents in Tianjin and Shantou is far more serious than the temporary damage to American interests. Japanese spokesmen have threatened to no longer respect the Open Door Policy, but this policy, like the Monroe Doctrine, is a cornerstone of American foreign policy and cannot be allowed to be violated. In short, after the constant occurrence of incidents in China, the United States will have to choose one of the following two paths: to put it bluntly, it must either completely withdraw from the Far East or resist firmly. Specifically regarding the Tianjin incident, it is still unknown whether the United States should make a decision immediately or delay determining its policy. At this time, the U.S. government is proceeding cautiously, unwilling to be more active than Britain and France, so as not to force Japan to take immediate action, but at the same time, it is working to make its position clear, so that Japan understands that the United States will not overlook the Far Eastern problem. Observers in political circles say that the Japanese actions against the British and French concessions in Tianjin are due to the belief that Britain and France cannot send warships from Europe to the Far East. Newspapers therefore all state that if Japan's attempt to control Asia is to be curbed, it cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the United States. In addition, the State Department compares the methods currently adopted by Japan with those of Germany, saying that both countries' strategies are based on alienating the other side and are well aware that democratic countries are averse to war and are unwilling to use force to defend various interests that are not very important on the surface, and therefore make every effort to exploit this psychology, repeatedly increasing their demands. All of this is the same." (Havas, 22nd)

### Regarding the Tianjin Case Question, Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Gives Vague Answers, Needs British Cooperation, Awaits Developments

(Tokyo) At a press conference today, the Foreign Ministry spokesman gave vague answers to reporters' numerous questions about the Tianjin situation. It is reported that the spokesman said, "What we need is British cooperation. The views already expressed on this matter can still represent the views of the Japanese officialdom. Our position does not need further explanation. Now we must wait for the situation to continue to develop." (Reuters, 23rd)

### Britain's Retaliation Against Japan, Not Intending to Implement Immediately, Chamberlain Answers Questions from Members of Parliament in the House of Commons, Believes the Situation Has Not Yet Reached This Stage

British Foreign Secretary Meets Japanese Ambassador

(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this morning, Conservative MP Pilkington asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he intended to immediately implement retaliatory measures against Japan regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, China. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "I do not believe that the situation has yet reached this stage." Thereupon, Prime Minister Chamberlain also presented a report, saying, "Members of Parliament have probably already read the news that British nationals in Tianjin have been subjected to insults in recent days. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax has invited Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu to meet with him today to discuss this matter. At this time, there is a severe shortage of fresh food in the British and French concessions. The amount transported into the concessions each day is only 10% of the normal amount. The government is discussing remedies. As for flour and rice, the stocks in the two concessions are still quite sufficient." Thereupon, Conservative MP Adams asked, "Regarding the insults suffered by British nationals in Tianjin, does the Prime Minister intend to notify the Japanese government that this action may cause British nationals around the world to suffer serious consequences?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "These insults are intolerable. Foreign Secretary Halifax will certainly inform Ambassador Shigemitsu today of our views on this matter." Thereupon, opposition Labour MP Henderson asked the Prime Minister to report on the situation in Shantou, China. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that the government had not yet received official news. (Havas, 23rd)

(London) When Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had requested Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu to meet with him at the Foreign Office today because of the recent atrocities against British nationals in Tianjin, the whole house cheered. The Prime Minister continued, "Members of Parliament have probably already read the news that British nationals in Tianjin continue to be subjected to insults." Labour MP Adams asked, "Does the Prime Minister intend to communicate to Tokyo that the insults suffered by the British may have serious consequences for Japanese nationals in British territories around the world?" The Prime Minister replied, "The Foreign Secretary will undoubtedly explain to Shigemitsu our view of this intolerable insult." Labour leader Henderson then asked about the situation in Shantou after the Japanese military issued the final ultimatum. The Prime Minister replied that he had not yet received an official report on this matter today, but according to news reports, the Japanese side seemed to have made some concessions regarding its position. Conservative MP Pilkington also asked the Prime Minister whether he would consider immediately implementing retaliatory measures. The Prime Minister replied that he did not believe the situation had reached that stage. The Prime Minister also replied to a question from Labour MP Wilkins that he could not comment on the total number of British nationals currently in Tianjin before he received notification. Mr. Haleji also asked whether the Prime Minister knew that the British people's anger had been aroused and that they were willing to back him when the Prime Minister mentioned this intolerable insult. The Prime Minister did not answer. Mr. Hai continued to ask whether the Prime Minister had any statement regarding the panic of British nationals in Tianjin. The Prime Minister replied that the current supply in the Tianjin concession was only one-tenth of normal and that measures were being studied to make up for the lack of various non-perishable foods in the concession. The stock of rice and flour currently stored in the concession is still quite sufficient. (Reuters, 23rd)

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the unfortunate events in Tianjin have gradually become intolerable. Chamberlain also said that Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu today and clearly informed Shigemitsu of the British government's view, that is, that this kind of insult has reached an intolerable point. When asked about the possibility of retaliation against Japan, Mr. Zhang claimed, "I don't think we have reached the point where we have to consider this." When answering a question from Conservative Adam, he said, "The British government is determined to ensure that the residents of Tianjin can obtain sufficient food." He also said that regarding the Japanese side's letter to Lamenton ordering foreign warships to withdraw from Shantou, the Japanese side seemed to have made a considerable retreat. (Associated Press, 23rd)

(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, when the House of Commons meets on the 26th of this month, several Conservative MPs will demand that the government take strong measures to deal with Japan.

### Serious Far Eastern Situation, Importance of Hong Kong's Defense, Becomes Center of Discussion at British and French Conference, Air Force to Visit Singapore Next Month

(Singapore) Multiple sources believe that the British and French defense conference being held here takes a serious view of the situation in Tianjin and Shantou. Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, may return to China early, but this has not been confirmed. It is also believed that the protection of Hong Kong is an important feature of the discussion. It is reported that defense experts believe that Hong Kong can withstand a long siege because it has recently taken measures to expand and modernize Hong Kong's defenses. Defense experts also believe that although the British and French navies are smaller than the navy of the enemy in the Far East, they still have great nuisance value, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements. Thorough preparations have been made for stationing a battle fleet in Singapore in wartime. (Reuters, 22nd)

(Singapore) According to news here today, the British and French joint defense conference being held here has made important decisions on various key points today. The naval, air, and land subcommittees of the conference all met separately. The naval committee discussed how the British and French navies should jointly patrol in the China Sea in the event of an incident, and decided on a thorough plan for warships to protect merchant ships. The air force committee discussed the plan to reinforce the Singapore air force from India based on the results of recent British and French naval exercises. The land subcommittee deliberated on how Britain and France would mobilize their military resources in the Far East. According to the Singapore Times, the conference has made concrete decisions on actions to be taken in the event of war. It is also reported that the Siamese Air Force will visit Singapore on July 4. According to the Singapore Times, the conference fully discussed the importance of Siam's position, and the Siamese Air Force's visit here therefore has important political significance. It is reported that the Siamese Air Force's visit to Singapore is the first of its kind. The Siamese aircraft participating in the visit include ten aircraft, nine Corsair reconnaissance bombers and one Martin bomber. After arriving here, they will stay here for two or three days to observe the performance and training of the British Air Force bombing, and will be hosted by the Governor of Singapore, Stenton, and the British Far East Air Force Commander, Babbington.

### Japanese Soldiers Intensify Searches in Tianjin, British Nationals Suffer Insults, Clothes and Shoes Removed for Thorough Inspection, Even Respected Individuals Not Spared

(Tianjin) Seven British nationals were ordered by Japanese searchers yesterday to strip naked for inspection, and were subjected to other insults. Crowds of Chinese men and women watched, finding it strange. British nationals are extremely indignant about this kind of atrocity. Yesterday, Japanese searchers invaded a certain location within the British concession and boarded a British barge moored at the Jardine Matheson wharf to investigate its cargo. By the time the British authorities received the news and sent personnel to the scene to stop them, the group had already fled. The Japanese Consul-General has sent the same letter to the foreign consulates, stating that all foreigners entering and leaving the blockade zone must carry their nationality certificates, must not be arrogant, and must strive to be humble, and must not photograph objects without the permission of Japanese personnel. The British Consul-General has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consul-General regarding the Japanese personnel's strip searches and boarding of British cargo ships for inspection, and has mentioned that British national Smith has been detained by the Japanese side for a week, and has asked why he has not been released. The Japanese Consul-General has promised to reply today. The Soviet authorities have also protested to the Japanese Consul-General because the Japanese side has insulted Soviet citizens. According to eyewitnesses, there are a total of 200 Soviet nationals in Tianjin, and they have been subjected to shameful insults. Even Soviet women have been subjected to strip searches, which were conducted by women, but the final interrogation was still conducted by a man. Yokohama Specie Bank has announced that it is willing to resume transactions with import and export merchants on the basis of 14 pence, but the bank is not responsible for losses incurred by merchants due to the current situation. Yesterday, three British nationals tried to enter the Special District, formerly the German concession, through the barriers on Wilson Street. One was Mr. Davis, a junk dealer and honorary agent for Newsron, one was Mr. Haoth, an employee of the Pacific Trading Company, and one was Mr. Lauder, an assistant secretary of the Tianjin Race Club. Mr. Davis was allowed to pass through without special harassment. However, when Mr. Haoth and Mr. Lauder arrived in front of the search post, the Japanese personnel immediately asked, "Are you British?" The two men replied in the affirmative, whereupon the Japanese personnel waved them to a mat in the middle of the walkway and ordered them to strip for searching. The two men then stripped naked in front of Chinese women and children, who were also waiting to be searched. Mr. Haoth stripped completely naked, while Mr. Lauder was allowed to keep his shirt and trousers on. The clothes of both men were subjected to a thorough inspection. The Japanese personnel also ordered Mr. Lauder to open his mouth. After he opened it, they ordered, "Open it wider." When Mr. Lauder could not answer, the Japanese personnel stuffed his passport into his mouth, forcing him to open it even wider. Mr. Lauder's hair was also messed up. Finally, the Japanese personnel ordered the two men to spread their legs and inspected their crotches. Only then were they allowed to pass through. The search of the two men lasted for 15 minutes. In addition, it is confirmed that five British employees of the Beining Railway were also mistreated when they tried to cross the International Bridge to their office. Among them were Mr. Villiers, the chief engineer and general manager, and Mr. Borden, the chief accountant. These five people were accompanied by several Belgian and French nationals. The Belgian and French nationals were not harassed and passed through safely, while the British nationals were all stripped to the waist and their pockets were thoroughly searched. They were then ordered to take off their trousers and shoes before being released. These five British men are highly respected among the British community, but now they have been insulted in front of a group of Chinese coolies, which is regrettable. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Tianjin) Recent facts have revealed that brightly colored photos with large stamps are a treasure for passing through the Japanese military blockade, and their effectiveness is almost equal to the signature of an important person. The players at the Spanish pelota court in the Italian concession live in the British and French concessions. Recently, because the British and French concessions have been blockaded by the Japanese military, and they have to pass through the Japanese military barriers every day to go back and forth to the pelota court, it is necessary to prepare passports for the convenience of entry and exit. However, there is currently no Spanish consul in Tianjin, so it is not easy to obtain a formal passport. Subsequently, a certain resourceful player devised a clever plan to create and issue his own passport. The beauty and elegance of the style should be superior to the passports of the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, these Spaniards followed the predetermined plan and used the red and green menus in the nightclub of the pelota court as signed card stock, and then pasted each person's photo on the menu, signed their fancy names, and stamped them with dazzling stamps. After the passport was made, a brave Spanish youth made a daring test. The Japanese sentry, seeing this exceptionally exquisite document, could not help but smile and let him pass without hindrance. (Associated Press, 22nd)

(Tianjin) The details of the insult to British national Davis by the Japanese are as follows: When the Japanese insisted that he take off his clothes, Mr. Davis refused with a smile. A Japanese man then struck him in the mouth with his passport three times. Mr. Davis always replied with "Thank you." Thereupon, the Japanese man summoned three more Japanese men. Seeing this, Mr. Davis knew that continuing to insist would be ineffective, so he agreed to take off his clothes and stood naked for 15 minutes. At that time, several Chinese were standing around the search hut, and more than a dozen foreign women were passing by. Mr. Davis is 47 years old, 6 feet 3 inches tall, and has a burly physique. He showed great patience for this extreme insult. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Tianjin) This morning, according to two foreigners who entered the concession, they saw the body of a Chinese man hanging on the electric wire barrier on Xinlu Road, on the edge of the concession, 500 yards from the entrance to Shanxi Road. The man looked like a coolie and his body was blue and yellow. This is the first person to die from electrocution after the concession was blockaded. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Gulangyu Consular Corps Protests, Japanese Side Rejects, Food Shortages Deemed Unavoidable

(Tokyo) The consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Gulangyu recently jointly protested to the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen because of the severe food shortage in the public concession there. However, the Japanese Consul has replied in writing, saying that this kind of food shortage is unavoidable, and has rejected the protest. (Reuters, 23rd)

### The Soviet Union Submits an Answer to Britain and France: The Stalemate Remains Unbroken; British Ambassador Sends Secretary to London for Instructions; German Business Circles Plan to Send Representatives to the Soviet Union

(Moscow) Today, the Kremlin continued its meetings, discussing the anti-aggression agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The meeting lasted for about half an hour before adjourning. Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov, Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin, and External Affairs Representative Sterling all attended. It is heard that Molotov informed the British and French representatives that the Soviet Union still cannot accept the recently proposed amendments by Britain and France. Non-official sources currently believe that the content of the new British and French proposals still cannot satisfy the Soviet Union's insistence on providing solid guarantees to the Baltic states. However, this does not mean that the negotiations have broken down. The British and French representatives have reported the results of the meeting to London and Paris and will temporarily suspend the talks to await new instructions. (Reuters, 22nd)

(London) Regarding the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, sources close to the government here have officially stated that Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov has submitted a response to the new British and French proposals. Its content is feared to still insist on the original demands, requiring Britain and France to provide clear guarantees to the Baltic states. If so, the current stalemate cannot be broken. However, the ongoing negotiations should continue to proceed. Generally, Director Sterland's report can be delivered to London tonight. When the Cabinet holds a cabinet meeting tomorrow, it can be submitted for discussion. (Havas, 22nd)

(Moscow) Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador's secretary, Roberts, flew back to London this morning to report on the negotiation progress. (Havas, 22nd)

(Berlin) German business circles recently decided to send seven representatives to Moscow (some are said to have already departed, and the rest are about to leave) to try to improve the economic relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. It is rumored that Germany will provide the Soviet Union with a credit loan of 750 million marks, repayable in ten years, for the purpose of purchasing goods from Germany. In return, Germany will purchase large quantities of raw materials from the Soviet Union, such as timber, leather, and various oils. In addition, the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, recently returned to the country to report on his work and will soon return to his post. (Havas, 22nd)

(Berlin) Prominent German business circles are now planning to send a delegation to Moscow to restore trade relations between the two countries. According to reliable sources, the delegation is instructed to propose to the Soviet Union a German credit loan of 750 million marks, with a term of ten years, to be used for purchasing German goods. Germany is also prepared to purchase large quantities of raw materials from the Soviet Union, especially timber, leather, and oils. Political circles here believe that this move is an attempt to resist British policy toward the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Moscow) According to sources in Berlin, German business circles are about to send a delegation to the Soviet Union to seek growth in bilateral economic relations, and it is said that Germany may provide the Soviet Union with a credit loan of 750 million marks. Well-informed sources here say that they have no knowledge of this. German officials also denied the rumor. Certain sources said that, while the British, French, and Soviet Union are continuing negotiations, it is not an appropriate time for the Soviet Union to conduct trade negotiations with Germany. However, after the Soviet Union signs an agreement with Britain and France, it is not impossible to sign an economic agreement with Germany. (Havas, 23rd)

### The Soviet Union's Policy Towards the Far East Will Become More Active; Lozovsky Appointed Director of the Far East Department; Soviet Ambassador to China Returns Home to Report

(London) The Warsaw correspondent of the Times claims that, according to reliable and responsible sources, the Soviet Ambassador to China, Luganets-Orelsky, has been summoned back home to report on everything, especially the current military situation and landscape in China. Also, Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Lozovsky, a man with great organizational talent and intimate experience in Chinese affairs, has been appointed as the Director of the Far East Department of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee. The late Karakhan also held this position. It is widely believed that this appointment by the Soviet Union indicates its intention to adopt a more active policy in the Far East. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Soviet Union Builds Navy

(Moscow) The Soviet Union previously ordered a new-style cruiser from an Italian shipyard with a displacement of 8,500 tons. It has been completed and accepted by Soviet personnel and named the "Liov" and incorporated into the Baltic Fleet. Its name was mentioned in the newspapers for the first time during exercises from the 19th to the 22nd of this month. In addition, June 20th each year is the Soviet Navy Day. The goal of this year's celebration is to mobilize huge numbers of workers to build the Soviet Navy. Deputy People's Commissar of the Navy Rogov recently declared that 1939 is a very important year for the Soviet Navy. A number of new ships will be added. In addition, the Navy's recruitment of sailors has been very successful, and a number of sailors whose terms have expired have volunteered to continue their service, accounting for a quarter of the total. The newly established naval academy has 300 places, and there are more than 400 applicants. As the former Navy Day is about to begin, workers from all over the place should send delegations to Leningrad and Sevastopol to participate in the celebrations, "where they will be entertained on all the warships in our country, demonstrating the strength of the national navy." (Havas, 23rd)

### German Troop Movements

Cologne According to today's news, the German troops stationed in various parts of western Germany are now drawing a small number of soldiers from various units to hold transport exercises at night to avoid hindering traffic. However, rumors that the Siegfried Line, especially along the French border, has a large concentration of troops, seem unfounded. Because there are a large number of troops in western Germany on vacation, which will not expire until August 1st. At that time, all the soldiers must return to their posts to assist in the autumn harvest. (Reuters, 23rd)

### German Minister of Justice Visits Bulgarian Authorities

### 21 British Bishops Express Great Sympathy for China; Call on Christians Worldwide to Pray on July 9th; International Peace Council Asks British Government to Restrain Japanese Aggression

(London) Today's newspapers carry a joint letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury and 20 other bishops, advocating that Christians worldwide hold a united prayer for China on July 9th. The Executive Committee of the International Peace Movement today passed a resolution urging the British government to take diplomatic and economic action immediately, without waiting for clear guarantees from other governments, to restrain the aggressors (Japan), and requesting cooperation with member states of the League of Nations and signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty to deal with the entire problem of Japanese aggression. (Reuters, 22nd)

(London) The joint letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury and 20 other bishops calling on Christians worldwide to hold a united prayer for China on July 9th states that July 9th will be named "China Sunday." Since July 1937, one million Chinese have been killed and 60 million have been left homeless. This prayer is to appeal for finance, strength, and courage, for the clergy working in danger and hardship, and for ourselves, so that we can fulfill our responsibilities to Christian doctrine. (Reuters, 22nd)

### British King's Visit to America Opens a New Page in Relations Between the Two Countries; Proves Blood is Thicker Than Water; Greatly Hopeful Roosevelt Can Visit Britain

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a speech in the House of Commons today, welcoming the British King back from America. He said that the warm welcome from the people along the way was beyond expectations. We are fortunate to be able to learn about the King's situation in various places through news, radio, and newsreels. The grand welcome that King George and others received from President Roosevelt and the American people after arriving in the United States was also unprecedented. Labor leader Greenwood moved that if President Roosevelt could break the old traditions and visit Britain or one of its dominions, he would also receive the same warm welcome. (Loud cheers) Greenwood continued, saying that the King's visit to the United States has opened a new page in the relationship between Britain and America, which proves that blood is thicker than water, and proves that the love of the people living under the banner of freedom and democracy is more intimate than before. The motion was passed unanimously by the whole house, and the House of Lords also passed the same motion. (Reuters, 22nd)

Lord Mayor of London Fetes the King

(London) The Lord Mayor of London, Sir Bowes, hosted a banquet at City Hall today to welcome the King. A total of 700 people were in attendance, making it a grand and historic occasion. After Sir Bowes delivered a brief welcome speech, George VI immediately delivered a reply, saying, "The impression I have received from my travels to the north is that the people's hearts can influence the world situation in this age of mechanical civilization, the scale of production is so great that its power is far beyond the reach of other forces. According to historical records, it is unheard of for a British monarch to tour the Dominion of Canada. The completion of this trip by myself and the Queen is truly a pioneering event in history. I deeply hope that this trip will have a significant impact on the future of the British Empire. An American historian once said that a nation is also humankind, and this statement is indeed appropriate for the Americas. When I was in Canada, the symbols of the British royal family could be seen everywhere I went, not only that, but the British codes and cultures were also widely promoted. All of these are propagated by the freedom and justice we believe in, and their significance to us is even greater than the glory of our history and language. Moreover, the people of Canada are able to trust us, not only because of my personal visit with the Queen, but also because all the ethnic groups within the British Empire are able to enjoy civil liberties, and they are expressing their gratitude for this. I will certainly support the ideals of the various ethnic groups within the British Empire in order to demonstrate that these ideals are indeed the potential forces for promoting peace and establishing sincerity. My responsibility with the Queen is to fulfill them with all our strength," (Havas, 23rd)

Londoners Welcome the King with Great Enthusiasm

(London) The King and Queen arrived at Waterloo Station in London at 5:20 this afternoon. Parliament adjourned a few minutes before the arrival, so that members could see the King's and Queen's procession from Parliament Square. The roads along the route were already crowded with people hours in advance, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk. The reception ceremony at Waterloo Station was very simple. After the King spoke with Prime Minister Chamberlain, he and the Queen and Queen Mary walked in front of the cabinet members and diplomatic corps officials. The King and Queen immediately took a four-wheeled open carriage to Buckingham Palace, smiling and nodding to the crowds holding British and American flags and cheering along the road. At the monument, the King raised his hand in salute, and the Queen and the two county lords also bowed. At 5:58, the carriage drove through the palace gate, and the cheering stopped. (Reuters, 22nd)

(London) The King and Queen's return to the capital today was broadcast by wireless film. Viewers could clearly see the flag-draped locomotive pulling the imperial car into the brightly decorated Waterloo Station, and saw the King, Queen, and two county lords get off the train, as well as the welcoming scenes on the platform. The wireless film camera then captured the King and Queen's procession from Buckingham Palace, and captured a large crowd waiting below from the balcony. The King, Queen, two county lords, and Queen Mary then came to the balcony, and the camera took many close-up scenes, which lasted for four minutes, all of which were seen by wireless film viewers. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Britain and the United States Sign Trade Agreement Stipulating Barter Trade

(London) A barter trade agreement between Britain and the United States was signed here today. The content stipulates that the United States will supply Britain with 600,000 bales of cotton, the value of which is calculated based on the average price after January 1st of this year, which will be about 6 million pounds. Britain will supply the United States with rubber of equal value, the quantity of which will be 80,000 tons, or one-fifth of the annual consumption of the United States. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Roosevelt Submits Great Economic Plan to Congress; Total Expenditure Requires US$3.5 Billion; To Be Used to Undertake Public Works and Develop Trade

(Washington) President Roosevelt today sent separate letters to the Speakers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, requesting that the government be allowed to allocate US$3.5 billion, of which US$3 billion would be used to undertake various public works projects, and US$500 million would be used to subsidize foreign trade. This money is not intended to be included in the regular budget expenditure and will be raised through bond issuance. According to the President's view, once the various public works projects are completed and put into use, this money can be returned in succession. In the fiscal year of 1940, US$870 million can be raised through bonds for public works projects, and US$250 million can be raised through bonds for the development of foreign trade. According to the President's plan, the main goal is to stimulate the US economy and make it active again. There are two main points: one is to carry out public works projects to relieve unemployment, and the other is to allocate US$500 million to the Federal Import and Export Bank to develop foreign trade, so that various countries can enjoy the convenience of purchasing goods from the United States on credit. This will be beneficial to Latin American countries. The majority of Democratic members of Congress seem to be prepared to support the President's plan. Republican members of Congress regard it as a strategy for the next general election. A few conservative Democratic members of Congress have also adopted a reserved attitude. Democratic Senator Byrnes of Utah (who advocated an agreement with Britain and the Netherlands to exchange surplus cotton and wheat in the United States for rubber and tin) said that Congress should study President Roosevelt's plan. He will hold talks with the leaders of the two houses and consult with President Roosevelt to discuss everything. Democratic Senator King of Utah has expressed his disagreement with the plan, calling it a "groundless plan." Republican Senator Taft also expressed his opposition, saying that he does not support any plan to expand federal lending unless a special event occurs. (Havas, 22nd)

### Rogers Will Return to England Soon to Report on China's Financial Changes; Leith-Ross Will Accompany Him When He Returns to Hong Kong

(Hong Kong) Rogers, a member of the Exchange Equalisation Account, will recently go to Chongqing and then return to England. If time does not permit, he will fly directly to England to report on China's financial changes. He will return to Hong Kong in a week or two, at which time Leith-Ross will accompany him again. The Hong Kong Government Gazette will publish a statement on the stabilization of the Chinese legal tender. After it is published, Rogers will make a major statement. The legal tender in Hong Kong has now risen to 44 [units of currency]. (Special dispatch, 22nd)

(London) Writers on financial issues have discussed the currency affairs of the Far East in detail, and many believe that the recent devaluation of the Chinese legal tender and the current Tianjin crisis are sufficient to shake confidence in China, and as a result, there will be an attempt to escape from the legal tender, so strict measures should be taken. However, London bankers have stated to Reuters that rumors that the Equalisation Account has been overly stressed are completely unfounded. Some even believe that the fund's management is still making far-sighted moves, aiming to squeeze out speculators. The Times said that in the current environment, the control of foreign exchange in China is far more complex than the control of foreign exchange elsewhere in the world. What is surprising is that China has encountered such obstacles, and even without implementing stricter measures, it can still maintain its currency exchange. Financial News said that the strengthening of the existing restrictions by the Japanese has not alarmed the circles in London and the Far East, because they believe that Japan's gold and foreign exchange are rapidly depleting. The newspaper also said that it is widely believed that Japan is now secretly planning for the flow of an informal market for the Japanese yen, hoping to encourage the use of devalued Japanese yen to increase invisible exports such as traveler traffic. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Changde Madly; More Than 500 Bombs Dropped in Total; Six Fires Broke Out Inside and Outside the City

### The Result of Two Years of Sino-Japanese War: The Chinese Are United; The Japanese Get More Than They Bargained For

(Moscow) The Red Star newspaper published an article today analyzing the results of the Sino-Japanese War in two years, saying, "The Japanese warlords' strategic plan to quickly defeat and encircle the Chinese army has failed. In the course of the war, the Chinese army has not only increased in number, but has also become a unified entity with excellent morale, high combat effectiveness, and unified command. The Japanese have attempted to divide the unity of the Chinese people, but this attempt has also failed. "What have the Japanese gained in two years of war, at the cost of more than 800,000 casualties? Only 12% of Chinese territory, and even in this area, there are still one million Chinese guerrillas and 80 regular divisions engaged in activities, making the Japanese control of the occupied areas extremely weak. At the same time, the price paid by Japanese imperialism for this harvest is also extremely large. The prolongation of the war of aggression against China has brought Japan's economic life to the brink of bankruptcy. Military expenditure has consumed more than half of the country's gold reserves. Due to the extreme lack of raw materials for military use and daily necessities, the total amount of national debt has increased sharply, and taxes have also increased several times. The people's dissatisfaction with the war is growing, and anti-war sentiment has recently spread throughout the army. "From this point of view, the Chinese people have every reason to believe that although they have lost a part of their territory, the victors are now also on their side. "The Chinese people are now united, have passed through the stage of strategic withdrawal, and are entering the stage of accumulating strength and preparing for a general counter-offensive. They have gained the sympathy of all progressive mankind, and they have deep confidence in the final victory. (TASS, 22nd)

### West River in Guangdong Province Rises; Southwest Roads Become More Secure; Rumor Claims Japanese Army Plans to Take Advantage of the Rising Water to Invade Guangxi, But This is Probably Impossible in Reality

Wuzhou Correspondence, Guangxi Inland, Every year during the turn of spring and summer, continuous rain and mountain floods cause the rivers to rise. Ships can navigate everywhere. Since the beginning of summer this year, heavy rains have fallen in Guilin, Yong, Liuzhou, Longzhou, Baise, Yulin, and other areas, causing the Lijiang River, Liujiang River, Yongjiang River, and the rivers of Baise and Longzhou to rise simultaneously. Since mid-May, electric ships traveling from Wuzhou to Guilin, Liuzhou, or Nanning have been able to navigate directly, greatly facilitating transportation. However, most of the Guangxi highways have been destroyed. The benefit of the weather and rain can be used as a remedy for transportation after the destruction of various highways.

After the rivers in Guangxi Province have flooded, there is a rumor that the Japanese army is preparing to invade westward, or that the Japanese army will use its shallow-draft ships and iron-hulled sailboats to sail upstream to capture Wuzhou. However, judging from the terrain of the West River waterway, although the water level is high, the rise and fall of the water level in the upper reaches is quite rapid. If it rains heavily for ten days without stopping, it can rise more than ten feet or even ten feet overnight. Conversely, it can fall to the same level in a few days. Moreover, above Zhaoqing, the water is rapid and the shoals are treacherous; above Wuzhou, the reefs are jagged and scattered all over the riverbed, which can serve as a natural barrier for military purposes. From a military perspective, according to information obtained in the lower half of May and the first half of June, the Japanese army along the banks of Jiujiang, Shatou, Makou, Hekou, and Sanshui has less than 5,000 troops. In Jiangmen, Xinhui, Heshan, and other places, excluding puppet troops, the regular Japanese army is also less than 3,000 troops. In Guangzhou, less than 20,000 troops are assigned to northern Guangdong and the eastern routes. In total, the Japanese army stationed in Guangdong, including all army, navy, and air force branches, is actually less than three divisions. If they were to rashly attempt a westward invasion, it would be impossible in terms of strength.

On the southern front, Japanese warships have been moving unpredictably along the coast recently. For the sake of preparedness, the Chinese authorities have implemented martial law along the coast of Gaolei from the 10th of this month, including Zha Po, Shuidong, Meicha, Xuwen, Suixi Jianghong, Anpu, Shankou, and other areas. In all martial law areas along the coast, the population is thoroughly evacuated according to the scorched earth policy, and food, livestock, and all materials are moved away. Outgoing passengers are strictly inspected. Recently, General Xia Wei, commander-in-chief of a certain group army, has dispatched crack troops commanded by two generals from Guilin to Qinzhou and Lianzhou to assist the special garrison area troops in jointly defending the southern coastal route. At the same time, Liang Hansong, commander of the Yongning militia area, and Long Zhenyi, deputy commander of the Yulin militia area, were ordered to lead some elite militia to the southern route to deploy defenses in key areas along the Guangdong-Guangxi border, so that in the event of an emergency, they can quickly join the coastal troops to block the enemy head-on.

### League of Nations Advisor, Hydraulic Expert, Puteli Deng, Dies in Accident; Drowned While Surveying Water Conservancy on the Jinsha River; Capsized Boat at Laojundong

Kunming Airlines News, The Jinsha River, also known as the Yangtze River, has a very long basin. Navigation is unimpeded and transportation is convenient in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Sichuan. Only in the Yunnan border area, the water is turbulent, the shoals are large, and there are many rocks, making it impossible to navigate ships. Over the years, the government has sent personnel to survey and improve the situation, but without any results. Recently, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Communications specially hired League of Nations consultant and hydraulic expert Puteli, along with technician Zhang Jiong, the Southwest Transportation Office water conservancy survey committee member Hu Yunzhou, and a group of eight people, to survey the water conservancy of the Jinsha River. They encountered an accident when they were going to Laojundong, only the sailor Yan Mengyuan was rescued. After the two ministries and the provincial government heard the news, they sent personnel to investigate the truth one after another, and ordered the counties along the river to search for the corpses. On the 28th of last month, they sent Yan Mengyuan to point out the location. Later, a corpse was found near Xintang Bay in Qiaojia County. It was so rotten that it could not be identified. A badge of the Ministry of Communications No. 71, a drawing eraser, and a Chinese knife were found on his body. After detailed investigation, the badge was worn by Advisor Pu. The body of Pu was transported to the province the day before yesterday. Zhang Yuanshan, a member of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, heard the news and immediately transferred Pu's body to Kunhua Hospital. Representatives of Pu's family, Du Lu, a representative of the League of Nations Anti-epidemic Committee, and Chinese and Western doctors examined the body. A gold ring with Pu's name engraved on it was found on Pu's finger. There were no wounds on the body, confirming that he had drowned. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to report the details, and a reply was sent that the ministry would be responsible for Pu's coffin, burial, and post-mortem compensation, and requested the National Government to commend him. Du Lu approved. It is planned to transport Pu's coffin back to Holland for burial within a few days.

### Japanese Puppets in Qingpu Absorb Legal Tender

Forcing the Public to Use Fake Currency

Qingpu Correspondence, Since the emergence of the China Development Bank, the Japanese army stationed in Qingpu has forced the public to use counterfeit currency. However, the public does not trust it. Therefore, except for purchasing bus tickets and obtaining passes with counterfeit currency, legal tender is still generally used. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese army stationed in Qingpu ordered the puppet organization to notify the public that from the 20th of this month, they are not allowed to carry legal tender out of the country, and those who violate this will be severely punished. Therefore, Qingpu commerce has been extremely chaotic recently, and several businesses must have closed down.

### Kunshan Puppet Tax Office Director Embezzles and is Arrested

A General Warning to Other Accomplices

Kunshan Correspondence, Wang Youzhi, the puppet magistrate of Kunshan, organized a puppet rent and tax office last year and appointed Xie Anbo as the puppet director to collect land taxes. However, after the farmers were robbed, very few of them paid their rent and taxes. Seeing that it was ineffective, Wang Youzhi assigned a large number of puppet officials to set up branch offices in the countryside to force payment in coordination with the puppet police. Liu Chengzhang, the chief of the Pengjian Township puppet branch office, had served as the director of the county government's land tax office before the war. This time, when Xie Anbo came to power, Liu also willingly acted as a demonic dog, oppressing the villagers on weekdays and acting as a tiger's henchman, his arrogance was immense. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly arrested by the puppet detective team the day before yesterday, allegedly on suspicion of embezzling funds. He is now detained in the puppet detective team, awaiting investigation.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Administration Situation Ruan Yicheng's Report at the Provincial Council

Jinhua Correspondence, Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, reported on the department's administration at the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Council on May 1 this year. A brief record is as follows:

(1) Administrative organization. The wartime administrative organization should be simple in structure, centralized in power, and flexible in operation. Therefore, this province has determined that the commissioner's office at the commissioner level is supervisory and guiding in nature, and formulated the criteria for exercising its powers. The application of both peacetime and wartime powers is clearly stipulated. The commissioner's office and the district command headquarters are merged to form an organization to achieve military and political unity. The division of the previous administrative inspectorate districts is not entirely consistent with the current military situation. In the western Zhejiang area, the enemy and we restrain each other, and the counties under the jurisdiction of each district must be re-divided according to military geography in order to facilitate command. Therefore, the counties under the jurisdiction of the original first, third, and fourth districts are redistributed based on railways, highways, money, and the Qiantang River. With the consent of the provincial party headquarters, the commissioners of the first, second, and third districts concurrently serve as party affairs instructors in their respective districts to achieve the effect of unifying the party, government, and army.

At the county government level, the counties in the province are first divided into two types, A and B, which are the types of counties, and each type is further divided into three classes and six grades, which are the grades of counties. All counties in the guerrilla area are designated as Type A counties, and the provincial government will designate these counties from time to time according to the actual situation. The rest are Type B counties. Type A counties focus on being able to cooperate with guerrilla warfare and compete with the enemy for the people. Therefore, their establishment does not need to be greatly expanded. The county government should focus on command, and the execution of administrative orders should be assigned to various districts, townships, and towns, so that each unit can be enriched and used as the basis for political offensive. At the beginning of the fall of western Zhejiang, all county magistrates retreated to the rear. At one time, action committees were set up or two counties were jointly established. Most of the responsible persons also lingered and did not move forward. However, the people have a long-standing understanding of the county government and the county magistrate. If the action committee and the chairman are generally unaware of its meaning, they cannot follow the orders of the county government. Moreover, the organization of the county government is China's unified official system. Although the county territory has fallen, this local administrative agency should have been withdrawn or changed its name. Now the establishment of the various Type A county governments are all the same, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the guerrilla area. As for the establishment of the various Type B counties, it should vary according to the grade of the county.

The county is an autonomous unit, and the county government is the basic core for the implementation of all government orders. In the past, due to the lack of unified upper-level agencies, there were too many independent agencies within a county, or the county magistrate held another position concurrently, and things were not unified, expenses were wasted, and conflicts and friction occurred. All of this was caused by this. Now that the province has uniformly abolished bureaus and changed them to sections, and this year the command headquarters in various counties have been abolished and changed to military sections, which are incorporated into the county government. The county magistrate still holds the title of commander, and the deputy commander concurrently serves as the chief of the military section, so as to facilitate the command of the teams, and military administration has been integrated with the general county administration. It is a pity that various special laws and regulations and matters related to central laws and regulations cannot be completely concentrated for a while, and the number of positions that the county magistrate concurrently holds according to law is still around twenty.

(2) Administrative expenses. The expenses of the commissioner's office cum district security command headquarters and the Type A county government are fully paid by the provincial treasury according to the provincial establishment estimate. The administrative expenses of the Type B county government vary according to the county level. As a rule, the provincial treasury also allocates subsidies to the administrative expenses of various counties. The amount of subsidies also varies according to the county level. Because the first-class counties are large counties with better local wealth, the provincial subsidies are also more. The second- and third-class counties are already barren, and the subsidies are less, so it is difficult to achieve balanced development. Therefore, this year, the amount of administrative expenses of each county will still be determined according to the county level, but the provincial subsidies will be changed to be based on the amount of local revenue in the county. For counties with local revenue of 300,000 yuan or more, the administrative expenses of the county government will be fully paid by the county and no subsidies will be provided. For those with 250,000 yuan or more and less than 300,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize one-fifth of the total administrative expenses of the county government. For those with 100,000 yuan or more and less than 250,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize one-quarter. For those with 150,000 yuan or more and less than 200,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize one-third. For those with 100,000 yuan or more and less than 150,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize one-half. For those with 50,000 yuan or more and less than 100,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize two-thirds. For those with less than 50,000 yuan, the provincial government will pay all expenses. It is estimated that the total amount of county administrative expenses subsidized by the provincial government throughout the year is 1,121,073 yuan, an increase of 341,573 yuan compared to the previous year. The expenses of the district office are purely county funds, but counties in or near the war zone are also subsidized by the province. In the past, each county included the expenses of the district office under the item of autonomous expenses, which was a misunderstanding of the nature of the district office. It has recently been corrected at any time and ordered to be included in administrative expenses.

The expenses of the townships, towns, bao, and jia in each county were mostly based on the autonomous household donation of each county in the past. The donation rate was at least one cent per month or one yuan per year, and the maximum could not exceed three yuan per month. Although various methods for raising, compiling, and inspecting were also formulated, the compilation and inspection were unfair, the collection was cumbersome, and the township and town chiefs' own collection and use were the biggest drawbacks. Starting from this year, the autonomous household donations of each county will be abolished, and 20% of the autonomous expenses will be collected according to the standards of the land tax and general business tax and deposited into the provincial treasury for unified provincial payment. A total of 1,096,366 yuan can be collected throughout the year. Another 100,000 yuan will be allocated from the provincial treasury, making a total of 1.2 million yuan. 200,000 yuan will be used to offset the compulsory education expenses of the original autonomous household donations, and another 1 million yuan will be allocated according to the number of townships, towns, bao, and jia in each county. All outstanding autonomous household donations before the 24th year of the Republic of China will be exempted. The outstanding amounts from the 25th, 26th, and 27th years will be allowed to be collected by the end of June of this year, and will also be exempted if they are overdue, in order to alleviate the people's hardships. The previous collection of autonomous household donations by household was actually limited to the bao and jia system, which was based on households. In fact, in the countryside, those who bear the burden by household and by land are the same, but bearing it by land is fairer. There is now another kind of autonomous surcharge levied on each mu of land in each county. The total province is 500,000 yuan a year, and it is planned to incorporate it into the provincial autonomous expenses in the future for unified revenue and expenditure.

(3) Administrative employment. The examination and selection of county magistrates are the responsibility of the central government, and the provincial government is not in a position to handle it. The Department of Civil Affairs has handled the performance appraisal of county magistrates in the 27th year. At this time of the war of resistance, it is bound to pay more attention to military affairs. The content of the performance appraisal includes civil affairs, finance, construction, education, security, accounting, justice, conscription, social training, resistance to the enemy and self-defense, and national corvée, each with different percentages. The competent authorities have successively sent the scores and are about to start calculating the total score. However, if the county magistrate has not been in office for three months on the day of the performance appraisal, he will not be included in the performance appraisal according to the regulations. The appointment of assistant county officials in each county has been almost completely authorized to the county magistrate after the war of resistance. Except for accounting personnel who are directly dispatched by the provincial accounting office due to the independent accounting system, even the police chiefs and police assistants who were originally appointed by the province are now appointed by the county magistrate himself. However, due to the suspension of personnel selection and review, the use of personnel in each county is inevitably chaotic. The powers of the county magistrate during the war should be increased, but the laws of the country cannot be violated. Therefore, the province's Personnel Selection and Review Committee has resumed work, selecting and reviewing administrative personnel at all levels below the province, cultivating new cadres on the one hand to make talent available and gain security, and also formulating various rectification measures to correct this bad habit.

(4) Work supervised by the Department of Civil Affairs. In addition to what has been discussed in the above three sections, the management of food was transferred to the Department of Construction by order of the provincial government last autumn. This year, a Wartime Food Management Committee was established, with the chairman serving as the director.

Regarding disaster relief administration, this province has established the Zhejiang Provincial Disaster Relief Association for handling. However, the organization of disaster relief funds and property, and the management of provincial orphanages, are still decided by the provincial government to be handled by the Department of Civil Affairs. Recently, the Central Disaster Relief Committee ordered that social relief work should still be promoted by the Department of Civil Affairs at any time and listed as a regular and continuous task. All disaster relief and other matters must be promoted, utilized, and guided by the Department of Civil Affairs. This seems to conflict with Article 4 of the organizational regulations of the Provincial Disaster Relief Association promulgated by the central government. The current application for interpretation is in progress on how to divide the powers. Regarding conscription, although the investigation and control of strong men, the preferential treatment of families of soldiers in the expeditionary force, and the management of personnel in charge of conscription in the county are still the responsibility of the Department of Civil Affairs, the conscription of soldiers, the allocation of military quotas for each county, the organization and training of the national army, and the payment of money to delay military service are the responsibility of the military district command headquarters. However, the interpretation of conscription laws and regulations will still be handled jointly. Regarding police administration, and the prohibition of smoking and drugs, everything is handled in accordance with central laws and regulations. The police officers of the provincial police bureau and the provincial police training institute who withdrew from Hangzhou were mostly reorganized into anti-defense detachments to take on national defense tasks. The two inland and offshore water police bureaus have also directly participated in combat.

As for household registration, land administration, accounting, hygiene, and other tasks, the Department of Civil Affairs has paid close attention to them and implemented them separately.

### Overview of Northwest Fujian Products; Northwest Fujian Plays an Important Role in Wartime Material Supply

Fuzhou Correspondence, The northwestern parts of Fujian Province, located in the interior of the province, have always been known as desolate and impoverished. After the efforts of the local authorities to develop them, they have now become a vigorous and prosperous place. Moreover, since the important cities along the southeastern coast of Fujian have been completely designated as war zones after the War of Resistance, all political, economic, industrial, cultural, and other undertakings have moved to the interior. Therefore, northwestern Fujian currently occupies a more important position in the supply of materials during the war. The following is a description based on the findings of the investigation:

Rice Production

Most counties in northwestern Fujian are rich in rice. Among them, Pucheng, Chong'an, Jianyang, Shaowu, Taining, Jianning, Ninghua, Mingxi, and Qingliu are the nine counties with an absolute surplus. Songxi, Zhenghe, Shunchang, Jiangle, and Ningyang are the five self-sufficient counties. As for the counties with insufficient rice production, the first is Jian'ou, where the shortage of food is not very serious. Jian'ou has a population of more than 300,000. Compared with its grain production, it is short of more than 10,000 dan of rice every year. However, it is the center of grain transportation in northern Fujian. Jieshou, Changping Street, Masha, and Jukou in Jianyang, Jiangkou and Xingtian in Chong'an, and Linjiang, Shibi, Xianyang, and Fuling in Pucheng are its supply areas. Dikou, Fangcun Pass, Yanping County, Xiadao, Zhanghuban, Yunxi Pass, and Fuzhou are its sales areas. Rice passing through Jian'ou is at least 100,000 shi (140 catties per shi) or more per year, so the lack of grain is not very serious. The other is Yangkou. Yangkou used to be a special zone, but now it is the seat of the third district office in Shunchang. It is also short of no less than several thousand dan of rice every year. However, Yangkou is also the center of grain transportation. Jianning, Taining, Jiangle, and Shunchang are its supply areas. Yanping, Xiadao, Zhanghuban, and Fuzhou are its sales areas. Rice passing through Yangkou is at least 50,000 shi or more per year, so the lack of grain is also not very serious. In addition, there are the sparrow boats from Minqing, which are also the largest center for transporting grain. Guangze, Yanshan, Gushan, Tieluoxiang, Nakou, Shuikouzai, and Dagan are its supply areas, and Fuzhou, Yanping, Xiadao, and Zhanghuban are its sales areas. The annual transportation of rice is at least 80,000 to 90,000 dan or more. The only counties that are completely short of rice are Nanping, Shaxian, Yong'an, Liancheng, and Changting. Nanping has many mountains and few fields. The rice produced each year is only enough for three months. Shaxian is short of 76,000 dan of rice every year. At present, the population in the urban area and Sanyuan and other places has suddenly increased by 6,000 to 7,000 people, making the shortage even more acute. Yong'an has always been short of rice. Since Xiaotao, which produces rice, was placed under the jurisdiction of Ningyang, the shortage of rice has become even worse. Liancheng and Changting will inevitably face a rice shortage unless they rely on the assistance of Ninghua, Qingliu, and Mingxi.

Bean Production

There are two types of beans: green beans and soybeans. Soybeans are produced in Jian'ou, Jiangle, Taining, and other places. Most of the green beans are produced in Jiangxi. Every year in November and December of the lunar calendar, large quantities of green beans are transported from Jiangxi to Peicheng, Ninghua, and other places for sale. After selling them, they buy some sugar, salt, flour, etc., and transport them back to Jiangxi.

Water Bamboo Shoot Production

There are two types of water bamboo shoots: winter water bamboo shoots and spring water bamboo shoots. Winter water bamboo shoots are those that are baked within December, and spring water bamboo shoots are those that are baked from January to March. The annual production of winter water bamboo shoots in northern Fujian is 400,000 catties, and the annual production of spring water bamboo shoots is 700,000 catties. Winter water bamboo shoots are best when they are produced on snowy days. The more snow, the thicker the water bamboo shoots. This year is a lean year, and the production is not abundant. Currently, the market price in Yangkou is 120 yuan per 100 catties of winter water bamboo shoots. The most abundant areas for water bamboo shoot production are Shunchang, Jian'ou, and Shaowu. Jian'ou and Yangkou are the two major water bamboo shoot markets in northern Fujian.

Bamboo Shoot Production

Bamboo shoot production is dominated by dried bamboo shoots. Dried bamboo shoots can be divided into black bamboo shoots and bamboo shoot slices. Black bamboo shoots are those that are produced before the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar, and bamboo shoot slices are those that are produced after the Dragon Boat Festival. In addition, there is a kind of magnolia petal, which is dried at the same time as the spring water bamboo shoots in January of the lunar calendar. Nanping produces more than 20,000 dan per year. Shunchang, Jian'ou, and Jianyang each produce 5,000 to 6,000 dan. Shaowu and Jianning have the least production.

Oil Production

Every year after the Frost's Descent in the lunar calendar, it is the time for northern Fujian to manufacture tea oil and collect tea products. After the tea oil is produced, tung oil is continuously refined. Pucheng, Chong'an, Shaxian, Jian'ou, and other places are all rich in production.

Paper Production

There are a total of 43 counties in the paper-producing area of northwestern Fujian. Wangkou and Changxing in Changting, Zhonglian, Dalian, Shouben, Yuban, Jinglian, Dagong, Yangzhuang, and Gongchuan in Liancheng, Daguang in Qingliu, Shuntai in Chong'an and Pucheng, and Maobian in Jiangle and Shunchang are all famous inside and outside the province. Some are used for rolling cigarettes, some are used for wrapping tea, and some are used for printing. The annual value of those transported out of the province is 6 to 7 million yuan.

Tea Production

Fujian Province is famous for its tea production, and the tea in northern Fujian is the best. The tea-producing area in northern Fujian is Pucheng, Chong'an, Songxi, Zhenghe, Jian'ou, Jianyang, Shaowu, and other places, with a total area of more than 244,170 mu and an annual output of more than 51,100 dan. Among them, Wuyi tea in Chong'an and Yinzhen tea in Zhenghe are the most famous in the world. The annual production value is about 10 million yuan. After the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar every year, it is the peak season for tea.

In addition, coix seed, lotus seed, Alisma orientalis, rosin, and skin oil in Pucheng, oral lotus in Jianning, ginger in Chong'an, tobacco leaves in Shaxian, and camphor in Shaowu and Yong'an are all famous products in northwestern Fujian.

### Japanese Army in Nantong Searches Civilian Residences

Wang's Mother Commits Suicide as a Result

Nantong Correspondence, The Japanese puppets in Tongcheng, in view of the fact that Chinese patriots are very active in the city, have recently dispatched a large number of military police, led by traitors, to search the residences of people who have previously worked in various government agencies. Double posts are set up at each important intersection to prohibit pedestrians from passing through, in order to prevent Chinese patriots from hiding upon hearing the news. In the residence of Mr. Wang, a teacher at a certain elementary school in Chengxi outside the South Gate, several magazines and books published in Shanghai before the war of resistance were searched and taken away. At that time, Mr. Wang was out on business, so he was not caught, but his female relatives, who were young and beautiful, were all humiliated. Afterwards, Mr. Wang's family complained about the atrocity to Xu Yuchun, a member of the puppet organization committee in the urban area, but Xu dismissed it with a smile because the Japanese army had planned to attack the north to capture Shijiao but failed, losing the favor of the Japanese side, and he was unable to appeal for them. Mr. Wang's mother, because she was so humiliated and could not get redress, immediately committed suicide. The people in the urban area were all resentful when they heard about it. It was also heard that on that day, during the time when the Japanese army announced martial law, Wang Shaoqing, the head of the puppet organization center Fang, tried to pass through forcibly, and was slapped several times by the Japanese military police. Wang could only retreat with a mournful cry.

### Joint Graduation Ceremony Held Yesterday for Seven Baptist Schools; Total of 258 Graduates from Senior and Junior High Schools; Addresses by Li Haoshan, Lin Kanghou, and Zhao Jinqing

A total of 258 graduates (122 from senior high and 135 from junior high) from the various senior and junior high schools of the Shanghai Baptist Association, including Yates Memorial Girls' School, Mingqiang Middle School, Jinde Girls' School, the Affiliated Middle School of Shanghai University, Huiling Girls' School, Hudong Middle School of Hudong Commune, and Yancheng Middle School, held a joint graduation ceremony at the Great Shanghai Cinema at 9 a.m. on the 23rd. Over 1,220 people attended, including school board members, faculty, staff, parents of students, guests, and the graduates themselves. The theater was filled to capacity. Party and national flags were hung on the stage, and many pots of flowers were arranged, creating a solemn and beautiful atmosphere. Details of the event are as follows:

Proceedings of the Meeting

The meeting began at 9 a.m. with music played by Ms. Bai Lude. Guests, school board members, faculty, staff, and graduates took their seats. Then, all students and staff sang the hymn "Beautiful China." Pastor Fan Er delivered a prayer. Chairman Dr. Li Haoshan gave the opening address. The entire audience sang the hymn "Great Is Thy Faithfulness." Lin Kanghou delivered a speech. Ms. Li Meiyu performed a piano solo. Dr. Liang Gen delivered a speech. Principals of each school presented diplomas. Zhao Jinqing gave a speech. Graduates of each school sang the graduation song. Pastor Wang Chenghao delivered a benediction. A photograph was taken, and the meeting adjourned.

Record of Speeches

(1) Chairman Dr. Li Haoshan's opening address briefly stated: "Today marks the occasion of the joint graduation ceremony of the seven Baptist senior and junior high schools. We are very grateful for the presence of the school board members, distinguished guests, and parents. We are also thankful to the Great Shanghai Cinema for providing a spacious venue, which is greatly appreciated. We operate our schools based on educational principles and the various decrees promulgated by the central government, cultivating young people and establishing an educational foundation for the nation. Some of the schools present have a history of thirty to forty years. We dare not boast about our past achievements, but we trust that they have been recognized by the public. We will continue to adhere to our planned educational program and develop our schools. This year's graduating class from the seven schools totals 258 senior and junior high students. While this represents the achievements of the schools in one year, the cause of education is constantly progressing. Therefore, we hope that the senior and junior high graduates will continue their studies and not be complacent after graduation. We also hope that all the esteemed guests present today will offer guidance and contributions. We are immensely grateful." (2) Lin Kanghou's speech briefly stated: "In such times and in such an environment, I feel fortunate to be able to participate in such a well-organized and solemn joint graduation ceremony of seven schools. I believe all those present share the same sentiment. You are now graduating, but I believe there is no such thing as graduation in this world. As the saying goes, 'One is never too old to learn.' This is merely the completion of a stage of study in senior or junior high school. After this temporary graduation, your paths will diverge due to the differing family circumstances. Some will pursue further education, while others will enter the workforce. And within further education and employment, choices will vary according to individual interests. In this era of academic competition, one cannot stand alone without learning. Those who can strive should pursue higher learning. Guidance for further education relies on school teachers and parents, and students should also make a firm decision based on their aptitudes in order to choose their field of study. Those who cannot pursue further education and enter the workforce will come into contact with society. They should not only focus on academics but also pay attention to the ways of the world. I now present the eight virtues of the American International Society for Ethical Culture—'Sincerity, Integrity, Selflessness, and Universal Love'—to all graduates as a motto. Whether you pursue further education or enter the workforce, if you practice these eight virtues, you will benefit immensely throughout your life." (3) Dr. Liang Gen delivered a speech in English, saying that studying is like a clock, with its gears constantly turning without stopping. You should not stop just because you have temporarily graduated. You should constantly strive for self-improvement. He also said that young people have weak wills and should be cautious and maintain self-control to avoid going astray. (4) Zhao Jinqing's address briefly stated: "I have an indirect relationship with the school, so I am not worthy of delivering this speech. I will just say a few words. In these difficult times, how fortunate you are to be able to study peacefully and graduate. You have already gained general knowledge from your middle school education. At the age of twenty, you are considered masters of the country under civil law. Senior high school graduates are gradually approaching society. Given the current social and economic conditions in China, it is not easy to receive a senior high school education. Since you have had the privilege of receiving secondary education, you should understand your responsibilities to the country, your family, and society. Do not be lazy or wasteful. You should uphold the spirit of Christianity, not be selfish, and expand your concern to others. As the saying goes, 'He is a man, and I am a man.' Those who strive can achieve great things."

### Charity Basketball for Banking and Finance Industries: Baolian and Guoguang Draw; Mixed Team Defeats Banking and Finance Joint Team; Youyou Will Play Banking and Insurance Joint Team Tonight

The charity basketball tournament organized by the Banking and Insurance Amateur Association was held last night at the Zhongqing Gymnasium in Baxianqiao. In the first women's match, Xiangying was behind by four to six points in the first half. Unexpectedly, after the break, Xiangying's Rong Shujian and Xi Xun continuously scored, and the score soared, eventually winning by a score of twenty to eight. The second match was originally between Chizhi and Yinlian. Chizhi, due to the pressure of exams, was enthusiastic about this charity match but was ultimately constrained by circumstances, so only Zhang Liangxiong attended. Chizhi's coach, Wen Zongyuan, felt apologetic. A mixed team was temporarily organized by inviting Xufang team members to play against Yinlian. As a result, Yinlian's shooting was not consistent, with only Li Zhenzhong holding the fort. Although they led by 18 to 13 in the first half, they lost to the mixed team in the second half with a close score of 36 to 40 due to the rise of Mixed's Lu Dazhen. In the final match between Baolian and Guoguang, Guoguang initially flowed smoothly, with Chen Hongqi and Wang Nanqun scoring five points with dribbling, throwing, and free throws. Baolian struggled and finally scored a goal by Chen Xuechong. Later, they increased the score to nine to two, which was Guoguang's best period. After fourteen to nine, Baolian recovered and surpassed with seventeen to fourteen in an instant, leading by twenty-one to eighteen in the first half. In the second half, Baolian relied on Lu Gusui's activity, and the score increased to twenty-five to eighteen and twenty-nine to twenty-four. Unexpectedly, Guoguang revived and twice caught up to twenty-nine, thirty-one, and thirty-three points each. In between, they also surpassed twice with thirty-one to twenty-nine and thirty-five to thirty-three. Until the last minute, Baolian relied on Xi Lin and Xuechong's two throws, resulting in a thirty-five tie. Just as they were about to make further progress, the final whistle sounded. The second charity match will continue tonight at 7 p.m., with an even more exciting schedule. The final match between the Banking and Insurance Joint Team and Youyou is like a battle for the title between two giants in Shanghai. Tickets cost six jiao.

### Shanghai Invites Hong Kong Team to the North for This Year's Intercity Swimming Competition; Sharp Decline in Foreign Exchange Makes Traveling to Hong Kong Impossible; Special Environment in Tianjin Makes It Difficult to Fulfill the Agreement

The Shanghai Amateur Swimming Association held a committee meeting at Xiqing to discuss the resumption of this year's Intercity Swimming Championships. The meeting concluded that the sharp decline in foreign exchange makes it impossible for the Shanghai team to travel to Hong Kong. It would be easy for the Hong Kong team to come to Shanghai. At the same time, due to the special environment in Tianjin, it is also difficult to participate in the event. Therefore, Tianjin will not be able to participate in this year's Intercity Championships. It is only possible to consult with Hong Kong and ask them to come to Shanghai, which would be easier to arrange. As for the water polo league, seven teams will participate in this year's competition: two teams from Dongselei, two teams from Xiqing, two teams from the Rowing Club, and one team from the French Chamber of Commerce. The competition will begin in early July. The Intercity Swimming Competition was last held in Tianjin in 1936. It was suspended due to the August 13th incident, and has been discontinued for two years.

### Finance Cash Black Market Opened Yesterday; Bullish Traders Hampered by Limited Liquidity; Volume Only Exceeded Four Hundred Taels

Yesterday, the cash silver bullion black market situation was unpredictable, fluctuating constantly. Generally, it rose and fell, ultimately falling again. This was entirely dependent on foreign exchange rates and buying/selling momentum. Initially, due to the previous day's order restricting withdrawals of soft currency deposits and rumors of a sharp depreciation of foreign exchange, sentiment tended downward. Furthermore, some small, undercapitalized bullish speculators were being pressured to repay loans, leading them to urgently sell off holdings. Consequently, the market opened lower at 2,570 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver firm, acting on behalf of a wealthy bullish trader, aggressively bought over one hundred taels, pushing the price to a high of 2,620 yuan. Eventually, due to the continued depreciation of foreign exchange, the resurgence of selling interest among money exchange houses, and the constraint on buyers due to a shortage of cash, making activity difficult, the price returned to the 2,600 yuan level, once retreating to a low of 2,560 yuan. Afterwards, the underlying trend stabilized, gradually becoming stagnant. As a result, there was a significant drop of 107 yuan. Although there were no large transactions, fluctuations of twenty yuan or more were common. Trading was quiet, with only over three hundred taels traded in the morning and only one hundred taels in the afternoon. Silver jewelry also fell by ten yuan. Customs gold remained stable, while British pure gold, etc., rose slightly.

Bullion Drops 107 Yuan

From the morning, the initial opening prices for each bar (ten taels) were met with a wait-and-see attitude. Around 9:30 a.m., upon hearing news of a weakening foreign exchange rate, sentiment grew more pessimistic. Sellers directly lowered offers from 2,600 yuan to 2,560 or 2,570 yuan, yet still struggled to find buyers, mainly due to a lack of cash. Around 10:30 a.m., a certain silver firm suddenly began to accumulate on behalf of a wealthy client, and transactions were seen. A certain silver firm purchased fifty taels from a money exchange house at a price of 2,570 yuan, which was 19 yuan less than the small silver dollar rate on Tuesday of this week. Subsequently, gold firms traded amongst themselves for twenty taels at a price of 575 yuan. Although the foreign exchange rate was weakening, a certain silver firm's buying interest remained strong, with an upward underlying trend. A certain silver firm purchased fifty taels from a fellow trader at a price that jumped 25 yuan to 600 yuan. Soon after, a certain silver firm sold ten taels back to a gold firm at a price that leapt another 20 yuan to 620 yuan. Eventually, due to the continued strengthening of foreign exchange, a selling trend emerged, but the decline was also sharp, dropping 19 yuan instantly. A certain money exchange house sold one hundred taels to a certain silver firm at a price of 601 yuan. Subsequently, another money exchange house also started selling, and the price broke below the 600 yuan level. A money exchange house sold fifty taels to a silver firm at a price of 590 yuan. At this time, buyers were scarce, and the price plunged another 25 yuan. A money exchange house sold twenty taels to a certain silver firm at a price of 565 yuan. Following this, a money exchange house unloaded thirty taels to a silver firm at a price of 560 yuan. By this time, it was 11:30 a.m. No further trading was heard, so the noon closing price remained at 560 yuan. The market opened around 2:00 p.m., trading higher than the noon closing price by 5 yuan. Money exchange houses traded fifty taels amongst themselves at a price of 565 yuan. Subsequently, a gold firm purchased twenty taels from a money exchange house at a price of 570 yuan. Later, money exchange houses again traded fifty taels amongst themselves at a price of 565 yuan. At 3:00 p.m., a silver firm unloaded ten taels to a money exchange house at a price of 562 yuan. Afterwards, there were buyers at 565 yuan, but sellers waited, resulting in no transactions for a long time. The evening closing price was still 2,562 yuan, a sharp drop of 107 yuan compared to Tuesday of this week, fluctuating 60 yuan throughout the day. The cash gold firms' benchmark gold price was 10 yuan higher than the bullion price. The spot gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were no transactions.

Silver Jewelry Also Drops Ten Yuan in a Row

The initial offering price for silver jewelry from major silver shops was still 270 yuan per tael. Around 10:00 a.m., upon hearing that there was a formalized market price for bullion trading, with prices falling by about 100 yuan, they all lowered prices to small eight yuan. Later, until 2:00 p.m., they lowered prices again by small two yuan. It is estimated that major silver firms changed the offered price to 260 yuan, new silver firms to 258 yuan, and the purchasing price to 252 yuan.

Pure Gold Suddenly Increases by Half a Penny

London, 22nd dispatch: British pure gold suddenly increased by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 6½d. As a result, the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash also rose to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed Customs gold price remained stable, at 1.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard spot gold price also rose by four jiao, reaching 1,207.6 yuan.

### The Japanese Bank Suddenly Started Selling Foreign Exchange; Bullish Traders Hastened to Liquidate; Exchange Rate Became More Soft

The foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listed rates. In the black market, the Japanese Bank suddenly started aggressively selling, with the Yokohama Specie Bank offering the most. Some Chinese merchants and the Central Bank, etc., affected by the cash shortage, continued to liquidate, and the selling pressure was quite intense. Furthermore, Western merchant house Sassoon also unloaded a large amount, and foreign banks' appetite was not strong, resulting in a temporary oversupply that was several times greater than demand. Therefore, the weakening trend was quite sharp. At one point, the British gold rate fell to as low as 6 5/16 d 8125, and the US dollar rate was once quoted as high as 13.25 yuan. Later, the sellers' willingness to supply lessened, and Western merchant house Sassoon also stopped unloading and began to buy on the cheap, so the situation softened slightly. However, there were many twists and turns in between, but there were no overly large fluctuations and trading was still brisk. The Hong Kong dollar rate also loosened suddenly due to the aggressive selling by foreign banks.

Market Conditions Still Showed Oversupply

In the early morning, the near-term London Big Bar rebounded by 0.25, and the forward rate also rebounded by 0.125. The silver price remained stable. London raw gold rose by half a penny. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars and against Shanghai remained stable. The rate against French francs rose by 0.025. The US dollar rate against British pounds was stable, the rate against Shanghai rose by 0.1 yuan, and the rate against French francs rose by 0.0625. The Central Bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. At the bank opening, the spot selling rate for the British pound was 6 5/16 d 5625, and the US dollar rate was 12.75 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound rose by 0.03125, while the US dollar saw no change. After the opening, the Japanese bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, suddenly started selling, and foreign banks' appetite was sluggish, causing the market to weaken suddenly. The Japanese bank sold spot British pounds at 6 5/16 d 6875. At the same time, a foreign firm absorbed spot US dollars from a certain bank at 12.875 yuan. When the HSBC listed rates were announced, they remained unchanged. And when the silver equalization tax was announced, it was a slight 0.75%. At that time, the Japanese bank's selling interest grew stronger. Western merchant house Sassoon also resumed selling. Moreover, foreign firms and Chinese merchant speculators also oversupplied, causing the market to weaken further. The Japanese bank, Sassoon, and foreign and Chinese merchants all competed to sell spot British pounds to foreign banks such as HSBC, from 6 5/16 d 6875, weakening to 8125. They also sold spot US dollars to US banks, from 12.875 yuan, weakening to 13.125 yuan. At this time, foreign banks were also willing to supply at the above prices, but the absorption price for US dollars even exceeded 13.25 yuan. Near noon, the foreign bank, Banque de l'Indochine, aggressively sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms, weakening to 45 yuan. At this time, the selling pressure for British and US currencies subsided slightly, and they slightly tightened. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling rate for the British pound was 6 5/16 d 6875, and the US dollar rate was 13 yuan.

In the Afternoon, Sassoon Suddenly Started Buying

In the afternoon, Western merchant house Sassoon stopped selling and started buying, and foreign firms also came to buy. However, foreign banks' selling interest was still good, causing the market to weaken instead. Foreign banks and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger sold spot British pounds to Sassoon at 6 5/16 d 6875 and 75. Subsequently, a US bank also sold spot US dollars to Sassoon at 13.0625 yuan. At this time, the US dollar rate was quoted as high as 13.1875 yuan, but it soon tightened. Afterwards, Banque de l'Indochine successively sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms at 45 yuan, which was relatively stable. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling rate for the British pound was 6 5/16 d 6875, and the US dollar rate was 13.0625 yuan. As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, the British pound weakened by 0.15625, and the US dollar strengthened by 0.03125. The Hong Kong dollar, calculated based on the transaction price, also depreciated by 1 yuan.

Hong Kong Exchange Rate Plunges Eight Yuan

Hong Kong, 23rd dispatch: The market opened quietly this morning. The market price was unchanged from yesterday's close. At 10:00 a.m. sharp, the Shanghai exchange rate plunged eight yuan, to 217 yuan. At 11:05 a.m., the British and US exchange rates softened. The British spot exchange rate rose by 0.03125, to 1s 2 8125/256d. The US spot exchange rate rose by 0.0625, to 28.875 yuan. The forward rates remained at the original levels.

The Shanghai exchange rate fell again by two yuan, to 220 yuan. At 3:05 p.m., it continued to fall by two yuan, to 218 yuan. The US forward exchange rate also rose by 0.0625, to 28.8125 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Continue to Fall; Japanese Gold Notes Fall to 9.55 Cents

Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar remained unchanged. In this port, foreign firms still had a strong demand for foreign exchange. Japanese banks and speculators had stopped buying and were selling, causing the market to be very soft. The British pound was trading at 6 5/16 d 8125, and the US dollar was trading at 13.125 yuan. The market price fluctuations were quite sharp. The British pound closed at 6 5/16 d 6875, and the US dollar closed at 13.0625 yuan. Bullion opened at 2,570 yuan. Due to restrictions on deposits and withdrawals by silver and money firms, trading was greatly diminished, and the market price fluctuations were very narrow. The noon closing price was 2,560 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose first and then fell, and the evening closing price was 62 yuan, a sharp drop of 107 yuan compared to Tuesday. Due to the weakening of foreign exchange and the drop in bullion, foreign currencies all fell. The demand for British and US gold pounds was very scarce, and the decline was quite significant. Trading in British and US gold notes was not brisk, and the market price decline was also sharp. There was little demand for Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, Dutch guilder notes, etc., and the market was weak. Japanese gold notes lacked buyers, and the market price plummeted, with the evening market at 9.55 cents. Korean notes were at 8.6 cents. There was very little trading at the association. Houji sold 300 yuan of US gold notes to Taijin, and Changtai sold 200 yuan of US gold notes to Taijin. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 0.08 yuan, British gold notes fell by 0.01 yuan, US gold pounds fell by 0.15 yuan, US gold notes fell by 0.024 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by 0.006 yuan, French franc notes fell by 0.0004 yuan, Singapore Dutch notes and rupees each fell by 0.005 yuan, Annam notes fell by 0.002 yuan, Canadian notes fell by 0.03 yuan, Philippine notes fell by 0.015 yuan, and Australian gold notes fell by 0.01 yuan. Only Italian notes, German gold notes, and Siamese notes did not change.

### Discounting Now Has a Formal Market Rate; From 135 Yuan, it Leveled Out to 100 Yuan at Closing

Yesterday, the discounting rate for exchange drafts decreased because, after the silver and money firms agreed on seven payment methods, people were no longer as fearful as they were the day before, and the demand for cash had decreased. The discounting rate had also developed a formal market rate. It was heard that the initial discount was 135 yuan per thousand yuan, but by noon it had gradually retreated to around 100 yuan. The afternoon rate was still 100 yuan, a decline of 60 yuan compared to the unofficial rate of the previous day. Compared to before the summer holidays (20th), it was 30 yuan higher. The interbank lending rate of the money industry association remained stable, suspended at the original price of 0.25 yuan.

### British and Indian Silver Reverse Decline and Rise

London, 22nd dispatch: In the silver market, China sold a small amount, while India and speculators bought, resulting in limited trading. The market was stable. After the closing, it remained stable. India bought at the listed price, but sellers held back. The near-term big bar rose by 0.25, and the forward rate also rose by 0.125. From New York: The US spot price remained stable. From Bombay: The Indian silver market stabilized. Both the spot and futures prices rebounded by five annas.

### From the Tongzhi-Guangxu Period to the Republican Era, the 21 Yuan Rice Price Ceiling, While Nominally the Same as in the 19th Year, Actually Set a Record

The price of Shanghai japonica rice during the Tongzhi-Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty was around three yuan per shi. Between the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, although the rice price was more than double that of before, it was still only seven yuan and some odd change. Rice prices of four or five yuan were often seen. Once the Republican era began, the situation changed greatly. The highest summer rice price was above nine yuan, but there was no price of ten yuan per shi. In the ninth year of the Republic [1920], as a result of Japanese transportation, the rice price rose to twelve yuan, which led to the annual average rice price remaining around eleven yuan after the eleventh year [1922]. From the fourteenth year [1925] onward, the rice price was even more expensive. In that year, the highest price was eighteen yuan, and the annual average was fifteen yuan and seventy jiao. Afterwards, although the rice price sometimes fell slightly, it was mostly high. In the eighteenth year [1929], the Jiangzhe region suffered a plague of rice stem borers. In the summer of the nineteenth year [1930], the high price of twenty-three yuan per shi was seen, and the price ceiling also rose to twenty-one yuan. The autumn harvest in that year was quite abundant, and the rice price leveled off. Until after the August 13th Shanghai Battle, due to panic, the rice price once rose sharply. However, that was a wartime price and cannot be taken as an example. As foreign rice was supplied and the war shifted westward, the rice price gradually returned to normal. Until the late spring and early summer of this year [1937], rice merchants manipulated the market and hoarders speculated, manipulating the rice price to above twenty-one yuan and fifty jiao. Yesterday (June 23rd), the two municipal councils set the price ceiling at twenty-one yuan (17 yuan for indica rice). Although this price is the same as the price ceiling in the nineteenth year of the Republic [1930], it is actually higher. This is because the current market is calculated in shi, which is 85% of the old Shanghai shi. Therefore, the price ceiling of twenty-one yuan, converted to the old shi, is about twenty-four yuan per shi, which is the highest rice price since the use of silver dollars. According to this year's rice price trend, and only setting a price ceiling after the rice price exceeded twenty-one yuan, this year's rice merchants can all be wealthy, but the stomachs of the masses are small.

### Piece Goods: Procedures for Delivering Payment for Goods; Chinese Factories Have Changed Methods; Change to Payment by Remittance at 10% Above Cash; Japanese Merchants Still Insist on Payment in Cash; Dyeing and Weaving Factories Face Difficulties

Domestic Cloth

Cotton cloth, plain and patterned, only has small transactions on this street. Most of the quoted prices for payment by remittance remain the same. Cash prices are slightly lower than before the festival. Various client groups on this street were originally scheduled to pay for bleached and dyed cloth and grey cloth due on remitted prices. The producing factories are separately urging payment and clearing of accounts. For the 70% remittance and 30% cash goods originally sold by Chinese Shenxin and other factories, the method was changed yesterday to convert the 30% cash to payment by remittance at a 10% increase, i.e., calculated at a discount rate of 100 yuan. Many other companies followed suit, which was quite convenient. Both buyers and sellers of new transactions lack interest. However, Japanese merchants still insist on cash payment, and delivery has stopped. Warehouse receipts have been sorted out. All those with clear procedures can pick up goods as usual. Client groups are mainly shipping goods from Guangdong province's Mazhang and other places to various provinces by mail package.

Eastern Fixed

The plain goods market is still closed. There are no formal market prices for fine cloth and fine twill. However, the warehouse receipt goods that were refused payment the day before yesterday have already been organized and delivered separately yesterday. As for the talk of changing to selling by remittance, there is no way to discuss it. There are many difficulties in new trading. The situation is deadlocked and cannot be opened up for a while. As a result, the dyeing and weaving factories in Shanghai, which are springing up everywhere, usually use Japanese piece goods for printing and dyeing, add their own brands, and sell them as domestic goods in the market, selling well in the southwest domestic goods stores. 70% to 80% of the cloth sold in the city is Japanese goods. If you ask about the brand, they are all Chinese merchants. In fact, the so-called dyeing and weaving factories are all "dyeing" but "not weaving." Now, restrictions on cash deposits and withdrawals have been imposed, causing these loyal customers of Japanese factories - the dyeing and weaving factories - to force them to still pay in cash, because their factory owners do not care about their previous sales efforts, making it impossible to do business, and they are frowning and not far from decline.

Export

On the 24th, piece goods exports: 75 pieces to Yantai, 5 pieces to Xiamen, 40 pieces to Hong Kong, 35 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 46 pieces to Beihai.

### Talking About Summer Western Clothing Materials

— Jun

The woolen industry is usually a silent season in the summer of each year because, at this time, except for a small number of white bombazine and white Zhigong, there are very few woolen fabrics that can be adapted to hot weather wear. Woolen fabrics are suitable for spring, autumn, and winter. However, there are still transactions in woolen shops, but most of them are not pure woolen fabrics. There are thick skins, yarn Zhigong, double-yarn woolen fabrics, etc. mixed with cotton (yarn), and some linen (linen) fabrics. Indeed, linen cloth has also produced many styles in recent years, with crepe ground, small grids, color dots, and herringbone patterns (Harmgbon). The average prices are between three, four, and five yuan.

The world is progressing, and naturally, everything in society is also being improved, invented, and progressed. As for the summer woolen fabrics, there are indeed many types that are popular in Shanghai. As far as I have come into contact with, there are Palitos wool, Fanerding (which has been on the market for a short history), light gray and coarse rice-colored Zhigong, and the most characteristic is a kind called "mesh wool."

There are many different types of Palitos wool on the market, and the quality is also very high. Years ago, Japanese goods were extremely active, and the value was also the lowest, only four or five yuan per yard. Therefore, for a time, even Palitos long gowns were extremely popular. Since the Shanghai War broke out, Japan has been short of raw materials, so Japanese goods have shown a slight "ebb" and the price is no longer as cheap as before. Following this, it is gratifying that domestic Palitos wool is also active, with prices between six and seven yuan. In addition, there are also products from Shanghai Yihua Factory, but the highest quality and price are "British imports," with values generally around ten yuan. There are many shades of colors such as rice, yellow, and gray.

Fanerding is also completely woollen (All wool). There are many colors such as rice, gray, white, brown, green, etc. In addition to British goods, there are also other countries' parallel imports on the market. However, due to the quality of the wool, British goods are the finest and cleanest, priced between seven and eight yuan. Last year and this year, it has been selling extremely well. This year, colors such as rice, brown, gray, and solid colors are particularly popular, and almost all are out of stock.

Coarse rice and light gray Zhigong are probably not common on the market because their wool quality is good and the value is high, making them not as common as Palitos and Fanerding. The rice-colored ones have white "Made in England" words and a "lion playing ball" pattern printed on the edge of the fabric every three yards. This kind of Zhigong is called Concord Worsted in English and costs 23.5 yuan per yard (retail). The gray ones are cheaper and can be bought for 18.5 yuan.

Mesh wool should be the most expensive type of summer woolen fabric. It is woven from cashmere wool. It is incredibly soft and smooth to the touch. The fabric has countless small holes, so it is called "mesh wool." Although it is worn on the body, the small holes allow air to pass through, making it cooler than any other woolen fabric in summer. It costs 27 yuan per yard, and a suit, including tailoring, often costs more than 100 yuan. Therefore, those who can wear this kind of "mesh wool" are always wealthy young masters, bosses, and spendthrifts, which is not something that ordinary people can afford.

### Securities: Far East Stocks Fall

Customs Guaranteed External Debt Also Slightly Down

Yesterday, the domestic debt market was transacted in the public hall during the market, and Qiahe shares were still the most active stock, with a total of 23,100 shares traded. The initial price fell to 18.2 yuan. This price only rose to 18.7 yuan at the close after large buyers completed their buying. In the previous market, it was not decided how to deal with the restrictions on withdrawals from Chinese banks, resulting in sluggish trading. In the subsequent market, sentiment improved, and the buying prices of most industrial stocks also increased. The rubber stock market also showed a slight recovery. There were several stocks that were traded at the current low price.

The listed prices of Far East companies' stocks in London on the 22nd of this month (Thursday) fell across the board due to the Shanghai market changes. Shanghai Electric Tramway shares fell by two shillings and six pence, to 22 shillings and six pence. Baohan Insurance shares fell by three pounds, twelve shillings, and six pence, to 26 pounds and one shilling and six pence. Mecca Lee Bank shares fell by two shillings and six pence, to seven pounds. HSBC Bank shares each fell by one pound, with British registered shares at 77 pounds and Hong Kong registered shares at 80 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine shares fell by six pence, to 18 shillings. Fook Company shares fell by three pence, to one shilling and nine pence. Gulag Klim Pang Rubber shares fell by seven and a half pence, to 18 shillings and one and a half pence. There were no other changes.

The listed prices of Chinese external debts in London on the 22nd of this month (Thursday) showed a continued decline of one pound for customs guaranteed government bonds. The British-German Continued Loan (British issue) was priced at 52 pounds, and the Rehabilitation Loan (British issue) was priced at 37 pounds. The rest remained stable, with no changes. Physical goods were offered for sale in London, including 2,000 pounds of the German issue Rehabilitation Loan (with stamps), with a selling price of 30 pounds, a drop of seven pounds from the British issue listed price.

### Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds

Lottery Draw in Chongqing

The seventh lottery draw of the 24th year Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds was held in Chongqing on the 16th of this month. A total of six numbers were drawn: "01," "13," "136," "49," "641," and "184." The principal to be repaid was 4.2 million yuan in national currency, and the interest payable, together with the eighth-period interest coupons, was 1,512,000 yuan in national currency. Both are scheduled to be paid by the Central Bank of Chongqing starting on the 30th of this month.

### Yarn and Cotton: No Trading in Spot Yarn; Yarn Shipped to Shantou Returned to Warehouse

Although some people in the spot yarn market gathered as usual yesterday, most of them were just talking, because they could not raise enough cash and it was difficult to turn around. Business can only be conducted after a concrete solution is in place. According to news from clients, due to the Japanese army landing in Shantou and fierce fighting there, some of the yarn shipped to that place by the Fujian merchants has been returned, including 450-500 bales of 20-count cotton yarn, which are now stored in the yarn and cloth warehouse. As for Japanese yarn, since the new financial stability measures, there is a lack of legal tender, and the buying and selling of this yarn is all done in cash, making trading even more difficult. It is said that future transactions will require Japanese merchants to change to full remittance payments.

Today's cotton yarn exports include: 20 pieces to Xiamen, 100 pieces to Hong Kong, 105 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 235 pieces to Beihai, and 470 pieces to Haiphong. In addition, nine pieces of cotton yarn were shipped from Ningbo yesterday.

### After Relief Bill Passes, US Cotton Rises More Than Ten Pounds

New York cotton prices were very firm yesterday. The market opened lively, and traders were buying enthusiastically. This was because Washington announced that the long-debated agricultural relief bill was officially passed by a vote of 180 to 175. The government will allocate 215 million yuan, and at the same time, allocate 11.3 million gold yuan by a vote of 145 to 100 specifically for the promotion and transportation of surplus cotton. It is believed that 35 million yuan will be used for cotton export subsidies. (According to reporters' observations, if calculated based on the average of 7 million bales exported in previous years, each pound of US cotton could receive a subsidy of 0.01 yuan.) As a result, New York rose by more than ten pounds yesterday. India fell by one rupee, and Egypt fell by twenty pounds.

The outside market in Shanghai has been in chaos since the government restricted the free withdrawal of deposits. Due to payment issues, disputes have arisen on all sides. Recently, more and more foreign cotton has been arriving by ship. In order to calculate lower prices, foreign firms are calculating exchange rates based on the arrival date of the ship. With this sudden change in finance, manufacturers cannot pay on time, and foreign firms are suffering significant losses. It is hoped that this serious problem can be resolved as soon as possible.

Trading in spot cotton, both Chinese and foreign, remains suspended. Not a single bale has been traded in any factory, completely falling into a state of stagnation. However, 760 bales of cotton from Tongzhou in northern Jiangsu arrived.

### Grain: Trading in the Rice Market is Very Quiet on the First Day of Price Controls

Still Affected by Restrictions on Cash Payments

Since last week, rice merchants claimed that the supply of japonica rice had been affected, and the price rose all the way, reaching 22 yuan. The bourgeoisie did not care, but the general public's living standards could no longer cope. After the rice market was closed for two days for the Dragon Boat Festival, the authorities in the concession seemed unwilling to let it continue. From yesterday, price controls were implemented, with a ceiling of 21 yuan for high-quality japonica rice and 17 yuan for white indica rice, and no exceeding of these prices was allowed. Goods traded before the 20th will still be settled at the original price, and those with incomplete procedures should register immediately and be reported to the two municipal councils by the Rice Industry Association. Therefore, when the market opened yesterday, personnel from the political departments of the two municipal councils came to the market to inspect. Trading in the market was extremely sparse. Due to the extremely hot weather, sellers were afraid that the quality of the rice would change and wanted to sell. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance was preventing capital flight and stabilizing finance by restricting cash payments. As a result, only three batches of japonica rice were traded, totaling two to three hundred bales, and the price was difficult to maintain, falling within the price ceiling of 21 yuan. It is estimated that Chinese warehouse japonica rice was 20.082 yuan, Hengxing japonica rice was 21 yuan, and Maotai warehouse japonica rice was 20.5 yuan. Based on this rice situation, there seems to be a downward trend.

Yesterday, the market for indica rice was almost invisibly stagnant. Only two to three hundred bales were traded throughout the day. Because of the cash problem, companies and hoarders were not interested, and most stores on this street were also waiting and seeing. However, the selling price uniformly complied with the concession authorities' price ceiling of 17 yuan. High-quality Wuxi indica and Dashi Beijing indica were originally close to the price ceiling, but specially high-quality Nanjing indica was still a few jiao off.

### Ten Thousand Bags of Flour Shipped to Korea, Local Sales Quite Slow

Yesterday, the flour market's condition, though open as usual, saw unusually sluggish transactions, mainly due to a shortage of cash. Customers were hesitant, unable to make further deals. Local transactions were also scarce due to the lack of cash. Millers continued to hold firm at four yuan, six jiao, and five fen in cash, refusing any bank drafts. Consequently, only a hundred or two bags were traded in small batches locally. The market's future recovery seems difficult in the short term. As for miscellaneous grains and wheat, there was no regular market.

Today, ten thousand bags of flour were loaded onto the British ship "Xinjiang" bound for Rashin in Korea. Shipping flour from this city to Korea is unprecedented, or perhaps it was previously done via Japanese ships, which is unknown. However, this is definitely the first time being shipped by a British vessel. According to those familiar with shipping, it is likely because Japanese ships are all used for military purposes, leaving no ships available for loading, hence the switch to a British ship. Additionally, today one thousand bags were shipped to Weihaiwei, and another five hundred bags to Xiamen.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Cakes: No Proper Method for Trading

Trading in the oilseed cake and miscellaneous grains market largely relies on cash transactions. Supply outlets from all regions also depend entirely on cash for transportation and sales. Therefore, since the 22nd, when Chinese merchants and banks followed the "Ma Telegram" and restricted cash withdrawals for depositors, all sources and destinations have been completely obstructed. Currently, the guild has few good solutions for disputes arising from transactions before the 12th (because sellers are urging for payment and delivery, but buyers lack sufficient cash to pay). Moreover, in this environment of high prices, new transactions are indeed difficult. Yesterday's market still saw only scattered transactions. Besides new broad beans, which are reaching their peak sales season and saw a rise of one or two jiao compared to before the Dragon Boat Festival (details in the market price section), other commodities saw declines. Yellow beans fell by five fen to one jiao, and soybean cake prices have fallen below the three-yuan mark, with Dalian Yuanji cake at two yuan, nine jiao, and eight fen, and miscellaneous brands plunging from three yuan and one fen to two yuan, nine jiao, and six fen. Yesterday, 1,400 bags of imported cottonseed and 280 pieces of hide oil arrived from Ningbo, along with 11,720 pieces of soybean cake, 789 pieces of soybean oil, and 369 pieces of crude oil, all shipped from Qingdao. Today's exports included 100 bags of wheat bran and 825 bags of beans bound for Xiamen, and another 280 bags bound for Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Markets Weak, Silk Sales Unlikely to Expand

Overseas silk markets, both in Japan and America, are trending downward. Yesterday, Yokohama spot prices fell another 20 yuan, with the afternoon closing still in the lower range. Futures fell by 27 yuan. New York prices also lacked activity, with nearby contracts down by a small two and a half fen, and futures down by half a fen. Spot Japanese silk prices fell by one fen each, while Chinese silk prices fell by two fen each.

The local silk market is still waiting for a turnaround in the export of white filature silk. Currently, foreign firms are not offering high prices, and there is no prospect of cocoons from inland areas arriving in Shanghai, making it difficult for silk sales to expand. White "Tu Silk" and printed silk saw thirty dan traded yesterday. New goods also arrived in small quantities, making the market more active. Today, ten pieces of silk are being shipped to Haiphong.

### Eastern Zhejiang Dry Cocoons Arrive Safely in Shanghai; Western Zhejiang Dry Cocoons Still Under Threat of Coercion

The transportation of cocoons from Zhejiang province remains at an impasse. It is now known that a certain party insists on forcibly purchasing half of the cocoons, with half of the payment in arrears and the other half in "Huaxing" currency. At the same time, they are attempting to entice cocoon merchants to gather dry cocoons from guerrilla areas and move them towards transportation lines or areas under their control. It seems all conditions are subject to negotiation after the cocoons are en route. This clearly reveals the other party's ambition to seize everything. As long as bargaining is underway, the other party still has some leverage because they do not yet control all the cocoons. Once the cocoons reach the transportation lines, they will take whatever they want at their discretion, no longer needing to maintain this facade and haggle over the issues of "donations" and "taxes." It is hoped that the silk industry will not be fooled by this because once they compromise, they will lose everything.

Furthermore, new cocoons from eastern Zhejiang have safely arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, dry cocoons north of the Qiantang River can be transported via detour. Regarding the export of local products from eastern Zhejiang, it is necessary to settle foreign exchange as usual, but since the price of eastern Zhejiang cocoons is not high, the estimated value is probably not very large. Therefore, the losses in exchange rates can be compensated for through this method. Moreover, settling foreign exchange is a beneficial act for the nation and its people. (Xiang)

### Tea Market Remains Strong and Smooth

Yesterday, the local tea market at foreign firms saw strong and smooth transactions. A total of 652 boxes of various grades, including "Chouxin Zhenmei," were sold by Yongxing, Renji, Jinlong, Tianyu, Xiehe, Yih and, and Baolong firms. The highest price for "Chouxin" was 320 yuan to 260 yuan. Ordinary "Zhenmei" traded in large quantities from 250 yuan to 196 yuan. Also, Baolong imported 39 pieces of "Saitianxiang Zhenmei," selling for 61 yuan. The market remained firm and showed no signs of weakening.

In addition, yesterday fourteen pieces of tea leaves arrived from Ningbo. Today (the 24th), eight pieces are being shipped to Guangzhou Bay.

### Metals: Black Steel Billets Stirring After Long Quiet

After a long period of silence, the black steel billet market, previously burdened by an excessive influx of goods and sluggish sales in all directions, leading to a soft market, has shown signs of activity since yesterday. Tianjin merchants took the initiative, and inquiries also came from Yantai, Qingdao, and other regions. Furthermore, local thermos bottle factories and printing iron factories also joined the search, causing a sudden shortage of spot goods on the market, and the standard prices surged temporarily. For example, 200-pound goods sold for 37 yuan per box, and 2,000-pound goods (calculated at 200 pounds) sold for 42 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Dutch White Spot Prices Rise by Seven Jiao

Yesterday, according to London telegraphs, the sugar market saw near-term August futures rise another two "bans" to 7 shillings and 4 "bans" 25, while far-term prices remained unchanged. According to Dutch telegrams, July-August futures were at 8.55 Dutch guilders, and September-October at 8.20. The local guild's bid for spot goods of 24 grade coarse white was stable, with our firm at 29 yuan and 2 jiao, trading 100 bags. Other firms and re-export goods were asking for original prices. Taikoo's "Che Bai B Mark" from the West Warehouse was at the original price of 28 yuan and 8 jiao, trading 500 bags at a small discount of two or three jiao. CW "Ka Dong" warehouse was at 28 yuan, 50 bags; the West warehouse at 28 yuan and 3 jiao; CX mark at 28 yuan; DY mark at the East warehouse at 27 yuan and 4 jiao; and HX mark at 27 yuan and 2 jiao. Dutch white spot prices were asking for a rise of seven jiao, at 19 yuan and 8 jiao, and re-export goods rose by half a yuan, to 14 yuan. Both domestic sugar firms were observing, with few transactions. Only inter-dealer trading saw some transactions. Although the prices were higher, they could not be considered a regular market. It is also rumored that foreign sugar dealers are proposing to switch to selling through bank drafts. Whether this will be realized remains to be seen.

### Coal: Kailan Coal Rises with Demand

Kailan bituminous coal, sourced from Qinhuangdao under the control of a certain party, is not affected by foreign exchange. However, local customers are stockpiling in anticipation of shortages, leading to strong buying interest. Sellers, considering their goods scarce and valuable, have raised prices accordingly, by two or three yuan per ton. The price for Kailan No. 1 lump coal is 44 yuan per ton, special fines are 40 yuan, and No. 2 fines are 30 yuan, ex-warehouse. Customer delivery incurs additional charges.

Traffic and Transportation Weekly

### Jinhua Transportation Lines

— Sheng

Before the war, Jinhua occupied a very important position on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Since the outbreak of the war, although it has been under considerable threat, it has always held the center of transportation. According to recent communications received from Jinhua, the transportation situation there is still very smooth, and is now described as follows:

(1) Highways: The highways from Jinhua to various places are divided into four lines: Jinhua-Wenzhou, Jinhua-Ningbo, Jinhua-Anhui, and Jinhua-Quzhou. The Jinhua-Wenzhou line ends at Qingtian, with a total length of 195.5 kilometers, a one-day journey. You can have lunch in Lishui and stay overnight in Qingtian. The next day, take a small boat from Qingtian to Wenxi, and then switch to a wheel to reach Wenzhou. The ticket from Jinhua to Lishui is 5 yuan in national currency for the express train and 4.20 yuan for the slow train. The combined ticket from Lishui to Wenzhou is 3.50 yuan, including the boat from Lishui to Wenxi and the small wheel from Wenxi to Wenzhou. The Jinhua-Ningbo line ends at Xikou, with a total length of more than 255 kilometers, a one-and-a-half-day journey. Have lunch in Changle, stay overnight in Xinchang, and arrive at Xikou, where you can take a steamer to Ningbo. The fare from Jinhua to Changle is 5.42 yuan in national currency, Changle to Shengxian is 1 yuan, Shengxian to Xinchang is 1 yuan, Xinchang to Xikou is 2.10 yuan, and the steamer from Xikou to Ningbo is 2.30 yuan. The Jinhua-Anhui line ends at Weiping, with a total length of 146.58 kilometers, a one-and-a-half-day journey. You have to stay overnight in Lanxi and have lunch in Weiping the next day, and you can take the Anhui highway bus to Tunxi in the afternoon. The fare from Jinhua to Lanxi is 8 jiao, the fare from Lanxi to Weiping is 2 yuan and 5 fen, and the fare from Weiping to Tunxi is 4.10 yuan. The Jinhua-Quzhou line ends at Quzhou, with a length of only 99 kilometers, a three-and-a-half-hour drive, and a fare of 2.75 yuan in national currency. For each line, each person is only allowed to carry 20 kilograms of free luggage, and an additional freight of 4 li per kilometer is charged for every 10 kilograms (or less than 10 kilograms) exceeding this amount.

### Recent Situation of the Eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road

— Xun

Regarding the general situation of the Eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road, a brief record was published in the eleventh issue of this journal. Recently, a certain gentleman went from Kunming to Luzhou to conduct a personal investigation, and the information obtained about the road is quite detailed, so it will be described again below:

The Eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road starts from Kunming, passes through Qujing and Xuanwei in Yunnan Province; Weining, Hezhang, and Bijie in Guizhou Province, Chishui River, and reaches Luzhou through Xuyong in Sichuan Province. The total length of the entire line is 912.70 kilometers. After crossing the Tuojiang River from Luzhou, there is a highway to Longchang in southern Sichuan, which connects to the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. This section has a total length of 62 kilometers and is also a section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway.

General Overview of the Entire Road Project

It can be divided into four sections, and the situation is as follows:

(1) From Kunming to Xuanwei, a total of 258 kilometers, all road surfaces, bridges, and culverts have been completed early, the road surface is flat and solid, and heavy vehicles can drive. The Yunnan Provincial Highway Bureau has already been operating vehicles.

(2) From Xuanwei to Weining, a total of 179 kilometers. The road surface was only completed in early May of this year. The road surface has not yet started construction, and bridges and culverts are under construction. The mountain excavation project has not yet ended, there are many temporary roads, and vehicles cannot travel in rainy weather. In the current situation, heavy vehicles must never risk driving. Based on the progress of the project, the completion date of the road is estimated to be around the end of July.

(3) From Weining to the Chishui River, a total of 263 kilometers, the engineering aspects have been completed and vehicles can be driven.

(4) From Chishui River to Luzhou, a total of 210 kilometers, the road surface has been completed, but the mountain excavation project is in progress. During the construction period, driving is quite difficult, and some of the bridge markings have not been completed, and vehicles must pass through temporary bridges. The Southwest Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has set up an improvement engineering office and plans to start patrol work. Except for the bridge markings, other projects may be completed before the end of July. According to the current situation, heavy vehicles should not be driven.

Ferries:

If transportation vehicles start from Kunming and end at Luzhou, they must cross the river four times. If it stops at Lantianba, it only needs to cross the river three times. According to the current vehicles of various agencies and business firms, Lantianba is the terminal; therefore, in the future, transportation vehicles only need to cross the river three times, including the Qixingguan, Chishui River, and Yongning River.

Station Setting:

The Eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road, except for Luzhou to Longchang, Kunming to Luzhou, has a total length of more than 900 kilometers, and stations should be set up separately to facilitate management. In addition to Kunming and Luzhou as designated departure and arrival stations for the entire route, it is planned to set up eight stations along the way: Qujing, Xuanwei,  Jiaojiao, Weining, Hezhang, Bijie, Chishui River, and Xuyong. Among them, Xuanwei, Weining, Bijie, and Xuyong are lodging stations, and Qujing, Jiaojiao, Hezhang, and Chishui River are meal stations.

Itinerary and Mileage:

The itinerary of the road can be divided into five days. The first day is from Kunming to Xuanwei (258 kilometers), the second day is from Xuanwei to Weining (178 kilometers); the third day is from Weining to Bijie (175 kilometers); the fourth day is from Bijie to Xuyong (184 kilometers); the fifth day is from Xuyong to Luzhou (118 kilometers).

Transshipment.

There is currently no transshipment on this road. The Southwest Transportation Office and the Transshipment Management Office of the Ministry of Communications are planning to start.

Opening Time:

Except for the Kunming to Xuanwei and Chengdu to Chiyong River sections of the entire road, where the road surface bridges and culverts have been completed, there are many bridges that have not been completed between the Chishui River and Luxian, and mountain excavation projects are also under construction. Single lanes and temporary roads are encountered from time to time. As for the 179 kilometers between Xuanwei and Weining, the road surface has not yet started construction, and vehicles cannot travel in rainy weather. Observing the progress of the engineering aspects and the investigation of various county governments and engineering offices, the date when heavy vehicles can pass is at the end of July this year.

### In the Midst of Transportation Difficulties, Efforts Should Be Made to Utilize Pack Animal Transport

— Shi Ye

Recently, I read a correspondence from Wuzhou in the newspaper. Recently, the Guangxi Provincial Government and the Qinlian Garrison Headquarters jointly formulated a transportation control plan to organize material joint transportation stations, and mobilize highway officials, dock workers, cart drivers, and porters from various places to jointly form groups to handle transportation matters. The control and management are presided over by the Political Department. At present, in the southern Guangdong area, from Beihai to Heng County in Guangxi, a material joint transportation station has been established first, and general stations have been established in Heng County and Beihai. From Heng County via Nanxiang, Lingshan, Wuli, and Hepu to Beihai, branch stations are set up in all major market towns. The management and joint transportation personnel of each general and branch station are filled by the original highway officials. Each station is equipped with dock workers, cart drivers, and porters, with a total of more than 3,000 coolies hired. Each joint transportation station can handle passenger and freight transportation at any time and send it to the destination station by station. The purpose of launching this material joint transportation is: First, to engage in wartime transportation so that the transportation of all goods is not affected by the war, and does not stagnate due to highway destruction. The second is to maintain rear transportation and solve the lives of unemployed employees. The third is to prevent smugglers from smuggling goods in and out and deceiving government tax revenue.

Looking at the above news, the purpose of the organization of this kind of material joint transportation in Guangxi Province is indeed worthy of our admiration, and the two points of dredging the freight and solving the lives of unemployed employees should be the top priorities, arousing our deep attention. I remember a few months ago, there were fragments of conversations with tourists who had returned to Shanghai from Chongqing and Yunnan, including that although transportation between Yunnan and Chongqing was smooth and unimpeded, and travel was convenient, the lack of vehicles made freight very difficult. Goods shipped from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places to the mainland for sale are piled up in Kunming, Guiyang, and other places, as high as mountains, and it is quite difficult to dredge them for a while. However, there is already a highway from Kunming to Xufu in Sichuan. In order to save gasoline, the authorities used horse-drawn carts to transport goods, and the horses were escorted by a small team of soldiers, with 30 kilometers as a post station, and it was expected to take 12 days to reach the destination. It is being tried out and the results are good. In the past, there was also pack animal transportation, with each horse carrying 80 kilograms of goods, which was reliable, but the freight was also high, and it took 40 days to reach Kunxu. If goods are stockpiled and cannot be shipped, it is better to use this method than nothing, etc. According to the current goods transported to the mainland, they all take the route of Haiphong, via Kunming, Guiyang, to reach Chongqing. The lack of highway vehicles and freight difficulties are inevitable. Now, according to the horse-drawn carts and pack animal transportation mentioned in the conversation with the tourists returning to Shanghai, although the delivery time between Xukon is as long as 40 days, it cannot be said to be too long, but it is better than not being dredged at all, and the old pack animals were all privately operated, the organization was incomplete, and there was a shortage of manpower, and the results were less satisfactory. If the Chongqing and Yunnan authorities can pay attention to this, they can also learn from the Guangxi Provincial Material Joint Transportation Station and use this horse-drawn cart and pack animal transportation as transportation tools, improve their organization, promote a large number of porters, cart drivers, coolies and unemployed employees, and implement the solution of freight total mobilization through official-business cooperation. The 40-day journey may be reduced to 30 days, or even 20 days, and the number of 80-kilogram pack animals may be increased in each batch to dredge as much as possible.

This kind of method may seem too close to ideal at first glance, but if the person in charge can be based on the spirit of the Guangxi Provincial Material Joint Transportation Station and quickly improve this kind of pack animal transportation so that it becomes a beneficial tool for wartime transportation, not only can transportation be dredged, but a large number of unemployed employees can maintain their livelihoods because of it. Benefiting the people is often not shallow.

### 日艦逗留　閩省沿海
Japanese Warships Linger Along the Coast of Fujian Province
　　
But No Unusual Movements, Garrison Maintains Close Surveillance
　　　　
According to a telegram received from shipping circles, Japanese warships have been frequently traveling to and from the coast of Fujian Province recently. It was reported that five Japanese warships arrived and anchored outside the mouth of the Min River on the morning of the 22nd, launching motorboats for constant patrols. Local garrison troops are maintaining close surveillance, and coastal defenses are extremely solid and have not been relaxed at all. Shanghai-to-Fuzhou flights are operating as usual. The British merchant ship "Shenfu" was originally scheduled to depart on the 23rd, but due to insufficient cargo loading, it has been postponed to the 25th.
Japanese Troops Attack Guerrillas, Unwilling to Break off Combat
　　
At 5:00 AM yesterday, forty to fifty Japanese army soldiers, fully armed and carrying three machine guns, boarded the No. 3 "Municipal Government" paddle steamer at the South Pier of Pudong. They sailed to the garbage beach area at Xinlonghua South Head of South Huangpu and landed, attempting to attack the Wang Zonglin unit of the guerrillas. Initially, they lingered along the shore under the cover of warships for several hours, observing the situation before attempting to move south. At noon, they advanced westward for about three *li* (approx. 1 mile). The ambushing guerrillas responded instantly, unleashing a fierce barrage of machine-gun fire. Several Japanese soldiers fell, and the rest dropped to the ground to return fire. After an hour of engagement, as the guerrillas appeared and disappeared unpredictably, and their numbers grew with the battle, the Japanese troops, unwilling to continue fighting, retreated to the shore and returned to their original defense area on the same ship.
The Wind of Rising Prices Unabated, Cash Transactions Common, Copper Coins Scarce, the Cost of Living Ever Increasing, Relying on Cooperation from All Sectors to Stabilize Market Prices
　　
Since the drastic shrinkage of foreign exchange, various industries in this city, to maintain their own capital, have successively raised their selling prices. However, even those unrelated to foreign exchange are taking the opportunity to raise prices. This situation is heard of every day. Whether it's clothing, food, or transportation, nothing is exempt. Those announcing price increases yesterday include: (1) Watson's soda water, (2) lace products from both Sande and Meixin, (3) Zhenhe paint, (4) Changyu wine, (5) Bo'an light bulbs, (6) electric machine silk, (7) toothbrushes, (8) Tianyiwei extract, (9) Shaoxing rice wine, and (10) paper products. Cash transactions are also required. Moreover, copper coins are extremely scarce on the market, so the cost of living for citizens is increasing, and everyone is complaining bitterly. However, because the national government's authority does not extend this far, it is hoped that all sectors will quickly devise sound strategies to suppress market prices and maintain the livelihood of the common people.
Concession Authorities Enforce Rice Price Limits, Sending Personnel to the Rice Market for Supervision, Rice Merchants Violating Orders Given Severe Warnings
　　
Regarding the issue of rice prices, the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have stipulated that, starting from the 23rd of this month (Friday), whether wholesale or retail, the highest market price for white *geng* rice shall not exceed 21 national currency dollars per *shi* (approx. 133 pounds), and the highest price for *ke xian* rice shall not exceed 17 national currency dollars per *shi*. Mid-range prices will be reduced accordingly. This has been announced by the Municipal Council. Yesterday (the 23rd), the Soy and Rice Trade Association market and various retail rice shops in the two concessions complied with the limits. The Municipal Council sent personnel to secretly investigate, and it was discovered that Qian Heng Yuji Rice Shop (located at 1174 Xinwen Road, i.e., the corner of Gordon Road) dared to outwardly comply but secretly violate the limits, selling privately at prices exceeding the limits. This was deemed highly inappropriate. The police immediately issued a warning, ordering them to reduce prices to the limit. According to the Municipal Council, if the shop continues to violate the regulations, it will be severely punished.
　　
Transactions for Various Goods Must Be Registered Within a Deadline
　　
Market Management Committee Public Announcement No. 70: According to the Market Management Committee yesterday (the 22nd), in a joint meeting with representatives of various trade guilds, the chairman reported that because market prices are too high, the two Municipal Councils, to ensure the people's livelihood, will implement price limits. For all goods traded by fellow merchants in this market before the 20th that have not yet been settled, a detailed list must be submitted to the North Market Office for registration before 5:00 PM today (the 23rd), so that it can be reported to the Municipal Council for explanation and to avoid accidents. If you do not report on time, this committee will not accept any disputes that arise. This is a special announcement, and it is hoped that fellow merchants will take note and not make a mistake.
　　
Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Supervise On-Site
　　
The Public Concession and the French Concession, to maintain the people's food supply and stabilize rice prices, have agreed with representatives of the various rice trade groups in this city that, starting today, whether wholesale or retail, the highest market price for white *geng* rice shall not exceed 21 dollars per *shi*, and the highest price for *ke xian* rice shall not exceed 17 dollars per *shi*. The Soy and Rice Trade Association has already made a public announcement in the market so that everyone is aware. Subsequently, the Municipal Council will dispatch personnel to the Qinglian Pavilion market every day to supervise the implementation. Those who exceed the price limits will be prosecuted. The appointed supervisors are Englishman Logan, Chinese Pan Lian, and Zhang Yingmei. All three are staff members of the Political Department of the Municipal Council Police Department. In addition, a western constable and two senior Chinese constables from the Laozha Police Station will maintain order in the market.
　　
After the Market Opened, Transactions Almost Ceased
　　
The Soy and Rice Trade Market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday. Market Management Committee members Fu Qian'geng, Wang Tianchou, Gu Yisheng, and Zhou Zhibai arrived at the market before it opened, informing the 105 firms in the market that all transactions should be conducted in accordance with the authorities' price limits, and should not exceed the price limits to avoid being prosecuted by the authorities. After the market opened, because of the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram (urgent telegram) restricting the deposit and withdrawal of funds, the rice trade, which previously relied on cash transactions, now faced a 500-dollar limit on previously traded goods, whether due or not yet due, resulting in check return disputes. As a result, market transactions almost came to a standstill. However, market prices did fall back to within the price limits.
　　
Rice and Grain Management Committee Meets to Discuss Measures
　　
This *Xinsheng She* reporter learned from rice industry groups yesterday that, in addition to setting new price limits and rigorously enforcing the crackdown on speculation and manipulation, the authorities of the two concessions are quite concerned about maintaining the food supply for the concessions and facilitating the source of domestic rice. To prepare for potential problems, the Concession Rice and Grain Management Committee has decided to convene a Management Committee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month (Tuesday), where the matter will be discussed. It is also heard that the concession authorities believe that, as the rice supply in Shanghai is still sufficient and the source of domestic rice has not been cut off, there is no need to order foreign rice at this time, as there is no fear of a food shortage in Shanghai.
Japan Plans to Block the Northern Mouth of the Yangtze River; Britain Takes Active Measures, Adopting the Same Approach as the Swatow Incident; Japan Aims to Completely Exclude Britain
　　
The *English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that merchants in this city believe that the Shanghai British authorities will respond to the Japanese navy's request that British ships and warships not sail the Yangtze River north of Chongming Island and below Qinglong Port (excluding the port itself) by answering in the same vein as in the reply to the Swatow warning and uphold the right of British ships and warships to sail in the inland rivers of China. It will also tell the Japanese authorities that Japan's warning does not relieve it of the responsibility of not obstructing British ships. The Japanese naval authorities have stated that if British ships are hit during Sino-Japanese military operations, Japan cannot be held responsible. According to sources in this city, Japan's plan to completely exclude Britain by sending new river steamers to sail the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been thwarted. The plan was made by the Nissin Kisen Kaisha, which intended to operate three 500-ton ships. However, due to the active guerrilla activity in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the launch has been postponed. It is heard that the guerrillas are currently engaging with Japanese troops at Songji Port, which controls the ports of the lower reaches. Although the British Consul-General in Shanghai has notified the Japanese Consul-General that he cannot accept its warning regarding Swatow, it is heard today that merchants in Swatow believe that Japan will attempt to block the port of Swatow, just as it has blocked the Pearl River. The response in Shanghai to this matter is that the British government will not lodge ineffective protests but will take active steps to curb Japan. This is probably the time.

Adjusting the Availability of Currency, Please Formulate Supplementary Measures, Silver and Money Industries Telegraph the Ministry of Finance Stating that Legitimate Needs Are Still Supplied as Much as Possible
　　
The Ministry of Finance's urgent telegram (Ma telegram) ordering the silver and money industries to restrict withdrawals of deposits is seen by all sectors as an effective measure to curb foreign exchange speculation. The silver and money industries, in addition to having discussed and determined seven implementation measures, yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, reporting on the implementation process. Regarding the current availability of legal tender in Shanghai, it is predicted that, after the implementation of this measure to restrict deposits and withdrawals, cash availability will inevitably become tighter. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will adjust the availability of currency at any time. If necessary, it is earnestly requested that the government allocate more cash to balance market needs. According to well-informed sources in the financial sector, the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram was in response to excessive withdrawals by some speculative merchants in this city last week and early this week to engage in speculation in the black market for foreign exchange. It is expected that the Ministry of Finance, at the request of various industries in Shanghai, will consider formulating supplementary measures to invigorate industry and commerce, or for the funds needed by factories to store raw materials, so as to provide convenience to legitimate industry and commerce while curbing speculation. According to banking sources, the clause "except for the payment of wages" in the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram restricting deposit withdrawals, all national funds originally deposited in national banks such as the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, etc., are also not subject to this restriction on withdrawals. The Ministry of Finance has also recently stipulated that, except for national needs and the payment of wages, the new measures should be implemented.
　　
Legitimate Needs Hope for Remedy
　　
The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also received the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram on restricting deposit withdrawals yesterday and immediately notified all sectors to comply. It is heard that various sectors previously had measures to stabilize finances, stipulating that the number of weekly withdrawals was 5%, but the maximum amount was not to exceed 150 dollars per week, i.e., not more than 600 dollars per month. The new measures stipulate that the maximum weekly amount is 500 dollars, and the monthly amount is 2,000 dollars, which is broader than before and the difficulties are not as great as before. However, manufacturers, due to legitimate needs for purchasing raw materials, still hope that the Ministry of Finance will formulate supplementary measures to continue production and maintain the livelihood of laborers.
　　
Market Situation Gradually Returns to Normal
　　
Since the Silver and Money Industries Association agreed on seven important measures to deal with the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram, all banks and money shops have complied. Market rumors have ceased, people's hearts are at ease, and depositors withdrawing and depositing funds at banks and money shops have decreased. However, cash availability is extremely scarce, causing some difficulties for transactions in various industries, but this is a temporary phenomenon, and it will soon return to normal. Also, there have been many disputes regarding cash check withdrawals in the market. This is an inevitable phenomenon after restricting deposit withdrawals. For example, the discount rate for telegraphic transfers had no market on the previous day due to the chaotic market situation, but yesterday there was a formal market.
　　
Requests for Funding to Be Approved
　　
Regarding the payment of employee wages by various factories and firms, the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram is not subject to restrictions. Now the Silver and Money Industries Associations have decided that depositors paying wages, whose amounts are more than 500 dollars, may refer to the previous measures for stabilizing finances. According to this *Xinsheng She* reporter, all factories and firms paying wages must fill out an application form, which will be forwarded by the bank to the joint office of the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Development Bank for approval before payment. As for the application form, it can be obtained from the deposit bank.
　　
Foreign Exchange and Foreign Currency Transactions Decrease
　　
(1) In the foreign exchange black market, foreign exchange had eased in the morning due to a lack of cash, and the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. Later, due to the entry of Japanese merchant banks, prices tended to tighten again. Yesterday, some large foreign banks and Japanese merchant banks dumped foreign exchange, causing prices to ease. (2) The discount rate for telegraphic transfers had no market on the previous day, but yesterday the discount rate for small money shops was 120 dollars per 1,000 dollars, but few transactions occurred. (3) Formal transactions began in the cash black market yesterday, but the transaction volume was very limited. The price was 2,570 dollars, slightly lower than the unofficial market on the previous day. (4) Due to a decrease in buyers, the price of foreign currency in the money exchange industry has fallen. (5) The securities black market has been suspended for two days starting yesterday.
Japanese Ship Rams Norwegian Merchant Ship on the High Seas off Weihaiwei, "Kaizan Maru" Loses Course, Violently Collides with the Fourth Hatch of the HSBC Ship, All 60 Crew Members Miraculously Survive
　　
The HSBC ship of the Norwegian company Lide Foreign Firm (Phams Co.) was chartered to Fuma Shipping Company at 31 Gongguan Ma Road, and recently re-chartered to British Fortune Shipping Company on Jiangxi Road, sailing the northern shipping route. On the 20th of this month, the ship loaded over 50,000 bags of flour, 3,000 cases of Chinese Soap Company soap, and over 200 tons of other miscellaneous goods, set sail from Shanghai, bound for Tianjin, intending to directly unload at Zizhu Forest.
　　
Encounters Fog at Sea, Japanese Ship Violently Collides
　　
Unexpectedly, around 10:00 PM on the 22nd, when the ship sailed to the sea off Weihaiwei, it suddenly encountered heavy fog. At that time, the Japanese ship "Kaizan Maru" (Kazan Maru) was also sailing in the area. Due to losing its course, for some unknown reason, it violently collided with the HSBC ship. The fourth hatch of the ship's forward water compartment was destroyed and severely damaged. After the accident, the captain, a Norwegian named Danielsen, immediately issued a distress signal. Another Japanese ship, "Kozni Muru," together with the "Kaizan Maru," jointly provided assistance and immediately sent a telegram to Weihaiwei, requesting tugboats for rescue, but received no response.
　　
Ship Sinks, Crew Rescued
　　
British Fortune Shipping Company received a telegram from the ship at 8:00 AM yesterday, reporting the details of the accident and stating that all 60 crew members had been rescued and boarded the Japanese ship, fortunately unharmed. After 10:00 PM that night, the ship's hull was still visible above the water. However, the company resent a telegram inquiring about the situation yesterday afternoon, but had not received a reply as of late last night. However, according to a radio telegram received by the radio station, the ship has completely sunk.
　　
Ship and Cargo Losses Reach 1 Million Dollars
　　
This *Daguang She* reporter learned from Fortune Shipping Company that the HSBC ship was built in 1927 and was only twelve years old. Its gross tonnage was 1,920 tons, and its construction cost was 15,000 British pounds, equivalent to 450,000 Chinese dollars. As for the cargo carried, such as 50,000 bags of flour, 3,000 cases of soap, and over 200 tons of miscellaneous goods, its total value was between 500,000 and 600,000 dollars. Therefore, if the ship has indeed sunk, the loss of the ship and cargo will be over 1 million dollars.

The Public Concession Municipal Council, based on suggestions that the number of fires in the area of the outside-boundary roads in the Western District is increasing daily, has approved the addition of 15 fire hydrants on the roads in the area. It is also reported that the cost can be greatly reduced by using the T-shaped water pipes on one side of the main water pipes installed on the roads. Therefore, the locations for installing the hydrants have been specially selected to connect with the T-shaped water pipes. The installation cost of the 15 hydrants will be approximately 400 dollars. Once installed, they can be used immediately, shortening the time required for firefighters to draw water for firefighting, and preventing a small fire from becoming a conflagration. The roads where the fire hydrants will be added are Baoli'nan Road, Kaixuan Road, Dunxin Road, Daxilu Road, Columbia Road, and Anhe Temple Road.

"East Asia New Order," Japan's New Interpretation, Claims That It May Not Expel the Rights and Interests of Other Countries, Even Providing Protection or Increase
　　
The *North-China Daily News* reports that, at a reception for reporters held by the Japanese side yesterday (the 22nd), a reporter asked whether the "open door policy" would be maintained under the "East Asia New Order." A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy did not give a definitive answer but said that the "New Order" did not aim to expel foreign rights and interests from China but would protect and increase these rights and interests. Asked whether this meant respecting the treaties related to Nanjing, Tianjin, and extraterritoriality, the spokesman replied that the question expressed a completely different view of military operations. The "New Order" did not necessarily mean expelling the rights and interests of other countries from China. Every treaty needed to be investigated and discussed. The Japanese side did not intend to disregard treaty provisions. The spokesman also responded to a question about the blockade of Gulangyu, saying that the mainland was still in the hands of Chinese troops. The current measures were to prevent undesirable elements from infiltrating the Public Concession. A reporter then turned to the Tianjin issue, asking whether the United States was already involved. The spokesman replied that an answer could be found in Hull's recent remarks. Hull stated that the United States had no direct relationship with the extradition of the four suspects to the Japanese side, but other aspects of the case were related to the United States. The matter was triggered by the British authorities' refusal to hand over the four suspects. The British side then began to propagate the matter as if it were related to the rights and interests of all third countries in China. Asked when a peaceful attitude would be restored in Swatow and whether foreign ships would be allowed to enter the port, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy replied that the matter would be discussed at that time. Regarding discrimination against British personnel, the spokesman said that all foreigners were treated equally, but Japanese officials and people were well aware that the British government was assisting the Chinese government, so there might be discrimination against the British. The spokesman also said that the authorities of the two concessions had provided some cooperation in curbing anti-Japanese activities and that the Japanese Marines were also cooperating in the "Safety First Movement."

"Deping" and "Moufook" Ships to Ningbo Allowed to Carry a Small Number of Passengers, Limited to Those with Important Matters Certified with Guarantees; Rumors of 200 Passengers Are Absolutely Inaccurate
　　
Regarding the issue of resuming passenger service on the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, repeated requests had been made by all parties, but they have not been approved due to the restrictions. Recently, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, in response to the requests of a majority of its members, decided to send a telegram to General Chiang and Commander Gu, requesting permission to carry passengers to facilitate the return of fellow villagers. However, the telegram was sent only a few days ago and has not yet been approved. Yesterday, it was reported that the passenger issue had been resolved, with the "Deping" ship allowed to carry 200 passengers from Shanghai to Ningbo, and the "Moufook" ship also carrying a small number of passengers as an example. According to this *Daguang She* reporter's inquiries to the Sino-Italian Shipping Company yesterday, although requests have been made to the Ningbo authorities regarding the passenger issue, they have only agreed to allow passengers with necessary matters to travel to Ningbo, provided that they have accurate proof and reliable guarantees. The number of passengers is strictly limited, and the rumor of 200 passengers is not true. The "Deping" ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and will now set sail for Ningbo at 4:00 AM this morning. According to news from the shipping department of the German Lihua Foreign Firm, the "Moufook" ship has the same passenger procedures as the "Deping" ship, but passengers are still strictly prohibited from traveling from Ningbo to Shanghai. The rumor of formally restoring passenger service has been firmly denied. The "Mourfook" ship arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday and is scheduled to return directly to Ningbo at 4:00 PM today.

Japanese Planes Raid Chongqing Five Times: More Loss Than Gain, Japan Consumes 40 Million (Currency), China Losses 5 Million (Currency)
　　
The *Millard's Review* reports that Japan's recent five air raids on Chongqing cost at least US$1 million each time, for a total consumption of US$5 million for the five raids. This is the opinion of foreign aviation experts, several of whom were in Chongqing during the air raids. The Japanese consumption figures are as follows: the average number of bombers participating in the raids was 27, and each time the Japanese lost four of them. Each bomber used by the Japanese costs approximately US$125,000. Losing four aircraft each time amounts to US$500,000. Each bomber carries seven airmen, four of whom operate machine guns. Training an airman in the United States costs approximately US$100,000. If training a Japanese airman costs only half that amount, the loss is still significant. Other items such as bombs and gasoline are also considerable. Each aircraft carries approximately 1,000 pounds of bombs, costing an average of US$1.50 per pound, which means that the bombs for each aircraft cost approximately US$1,500. Since the nearest air base is in Hankou, each aircraft flies for eight hours, requiring approximately 800 gallons of aviation gasoline. Shanghai's major companies sell aviation gasoline in bulk at approximately US$0.25 per gallon, so the gasoline for each aircraft costs approximately US$200, totaling approximately US$5,400 for the entire fleet. The property destroyed in Chongqing does not exceed 5 million National Currency dollars (fapi). Therefore, the cost of the five Japanese air raids, according to the current exchange rate, has reached as much as 40 million National Currency dollars (fapi).

### Japanese Demand Foreigners Withdraw from Shantou: Britain and America Firmly Refuse; Japan Must Bear Full Responsibility; British and American Warships Stationed in Shantou Also Do Not Withdraw; Foreign Observers Express Satisfaction

The Continental Daily News reports that U.S. Consul General Gauss and British Consul General Philip firmly rejected yesterday afternoon (the 22nd) the final ultimatum from the Japanese Navy demanding that all foreigners withdraw from Shantou by 1:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd), stating that after this time, the Japanese authorities would not be responsible for the lives and property of foreigners. Earlier, the U.S. Consul General received a telegram from Admiral Yarnell and immediately drafted a reply to the Japanese authorities. Admiral Yarnell set sail from Qinhuangdao on a warship and is currently en route to Qingdao.

### Japanese Government Fully Responsible for the Lives and Properties of American Citizens

The telegram instructed Gauss to immediately notify the Japanese authorities that the United States requires the Japanese forces in Shantou to bear full responsibility for the safety of the lives and properties of American citizens. The U.S. Consul General then sent a note to the local Japanese authorities, refusing their demand and reiterating the U.S. policy in the Far East, stating that the U.S. government authorizes U.S. warships to sail to any location where the lives and properties of American citizens are in danger and refusing the Japanese request for U.S. warships to withdraw from Shantou. Before Gauss received the telegram from Admiral Yarnell, he had already forwarded the Japanese ultimatum to Washington.

### British Consul Takes the Same Stance, Rejecting the Japanese Request

Shortly after noon yesterday, the British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, visited Gauss. After leaving the U.S. Consulate General, Philip drafted a note rejecting the Japanese ultimatum, following the same approach as the U.S. note. The note firmly stated that British citizens have the full right to reside in Shantou and British warships have the full right to anchor there, as Shantou is a treaty port. It also stated that the British authorities cannot accept the Japanese attitude of not taking responsibility for the lives and properties of British citizens in the area and that Britain requires Japan to bear full responsibility for the lives and properties of British citizens.

### Japanese Send Conflicting Messages

It is reported that less than two hours after the Japanese troops landed in Shantou at 2:50 PM on Wednesday, they sent an ultimatum to the foreign consulates at 4:00 PM, demanding that all foreigners completely withdraw from Shantou by 1:00 PM yesterday. The Japanese authorities first notified the British warship "Sarnat" docked in Shantou and then sent the same telegram to the foreign consulates in Shanghai. Although the foreign consulates have confirmed receiving this message and have rejected it, the Japanese spokesman stated at a press conference in this city yesterday that he was unaware of the ultimatum and claimed that the statement that the Japanese authorities would not be responsible for the safety of foreigners and their property after 1:00 PM yesterday was "completely inaccurate."

### British and American Authorities Cooperate; Foreigners Express Satisfaction

When asked why foreigners were asked to withdraw from the city, the spokesman stated that this was a routine step taken immediately after the Japanese launched military operations and that there were Chinese troops "north and south of Shantou," so there was still the possibility of fighting in the city. Foreign observers believe that the Japanese spokesman's statement that it was "completely inaccurate" and the fact that the foreign consulates had received the ultimatum are contradictory and that the Japanese diplomats in this city are trying to cover up the ultimatum issued by the Japanese naval command in Shantou. It was also learned last night that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, telegraphed the British authorities in Shantou yesterday morning, instructing them not to encourage the evacuation of British citizens unless serious dangers were considered. Foreign observers expressed satisfaction with the cooperation between the British and American authorities in this city in handling the Shantou ultimatum. It is said that this cooperation is sufficient to demonstrate the close cooperation between Washington and London in handling Far Eastern affairs.

According to the English-language *China Press*, according to a person who has just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, British people in Tianjin were not only searched and insulted by Japanese soldiers, but also robbed by them, resulting in not only mental trauma but also material losses. For example, a British person carrying 100 yuan in legal tender was robbed by Japanese soldiers, and the mechanism of his watch was removed from the case. Foreigners in Tianjin believe that this action by the Japanese soldiers was purely provocative. An Australian was also humiliated, stripped of his clothes, and even his socks and shoes were taken away. Then, he was pushed back into a line of two thousand pedestrians waiting on the street corner for five hours before it was his turn to be searched. However, the search was not yet over when the Japanese soldiers ordered him to return again the next day. Any foreign nationals from Germany, Italy, or America were allowed to pass, even without being searched, but not British nationals. However, the Australian had important business to discuss and decided to enter the British Concession. He consulted with a Japanese friend, who accompanied him to the entrance of Shansi Road on the border of the former German Concession and told the Japanese officer in charge that he was Australian. The officer thought he said "Austrian," and his passport only had "British Consulate" and not "Britain," so he was not noticed and was able to enter.

### Everywhere in China, One Sees the Strength of President Chiang; Comments from a Reporter of the *Chicago Daily News*; Praising the Burma Road as an Amazing Achievement

Gandhi was deeply concerned about the Sino-Japanese War and deeply sympathized with China's struggle, as Gandhi hoped for universal peace and hated any kind of violence. Although some people oppose Gandhi's doctrine, Gandhi still holds significant power in India today. Although his appearance is calm, he lives in a noisy environment, and his keen mind is still active. It is reported that Mr. Steele traveled to India, Burma, and the southwestern provinces of China for half a year and has just returned to Shanghai. When he was in southwestern China, he traveled the entire length of the

Burma Road.

Mr. Steele met with Chairman Chiang in Chongqing and was deeply impressed by the Chairman's unwavering spirit. He also said that today, everywhere one sees the strength of Chairman Chiang, which is a clear sign of China's unity.
