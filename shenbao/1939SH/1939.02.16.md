Another unit of Japanese troops is currently attacking westward, attempting to invade Yexian County.

(Fifteenth Express News Agency dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to news received by foreigners in Guangzhou Bay, the fighting in the southern suburbs of Qiongzhou is still ongoing intensely. Although the Japanese troops are relying on the cover of aircraft and artillery to launch fierce attacks to the south, they have not made much progress due to the strong resistance of the Chinese troops.

### France's Attitude Was Too Cautious in the Past; Now It Can Be Clearly Understood

(Kunming) According to reports, Japanese troops have landed on Hainan Island. A reporter from the Central News Agency paid a special visit to Chairman Long to inquire about his views. He said the following: The strategic importance of Hainan Island's naval and air forces is extremely important, threatening Annam, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines, which is obvious. Its attempt to dominate the Pacific is even more sinister. Although the Japanese claim to be cutting off our military supply routes, this is actually self-deception. All wise men know that France's attitude towards Japan has been too cautious in the past, and the Annam government has been deceived by the Japanese. The restrictions on the transportation of goods on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway were extremely strict. Now it can be clearly understood that Japan's attempt to invade and occupy Hainan Island has not been a matter of a day or two. Once occupied, it is unlikely that it will be driven out. There is no possibility of automatic withdrawal. If it is used as a base to attack Guangxi, it is almost impossible in terms of terrain. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France should be able to clearly understand the path they should take. (Fifteenth dispatch)

(Chongqing) Today, a reliable American political observer told a reporter from the Associated Press that if a war breaks out in Europe, Japan will take advantage of Hainan Island to profit from the situation. Once something happens in Europe, it will be easy for Japan to use Hainan Island as a base to seize Hong Kong, just as it occupied Qingdao in 1915. From a tactical point of view, Japan must first seize Hong Kong before it can take any action near the South China Sea. Militarily speaking, Hong Kong's defenses are seriously inadequate. Japan will quickly seize Hong Kong when the British and French governments are fully focused on Europe and have no spare energy to defend their Far Eastern territories. Then, in cooperation with Siam, it will attack Vietnam, attempting to occupy the railway between Hanoi and Kunming. It is also said that Japan will not attack Manila until it has completely controlled Hong Kong. According to information obtained by the observer, a major European munitions factory expects a major war to occur this year. A Chinese military spokesman said that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is entirely a challenge to the Western powers and has no impact on our war plans. (Fifteenth Associated Press dispatch)

(London) Regarding the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island, after the French and British governments made representations to the Japanese government, The Times recently published a dispatch from its Tokyo correspondent, which stated: "After the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made a guarantee to French Ambassador Henry, he provided a guarantee to British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie with a firmer tone, stating that the Japanese military move was purely due to military needs. The implication is that it only belongs to the current military action's objectives and has no relationship with the Pacific military strategy issue. Other than this, there may not be a more concrete guarantee. Some observers here believe that this move by the Japanese will have a significant impact on the international political situation, so they believe that the so-called military needs of the Japanese are just a trick to deceive oneself." (Fifteenth Havas dispatch)

(London) During questioning in the House of Commons today, a member suggested that Britain and France cooperate to end the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island as soon as possible to eliminate the harm to British and French territories and Far Eastern trade. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that the British and French governments are constantly in contact regarding the most appropriate means to safeguard their common interests in the South China Sea. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

(London) Persons in charge here recently stated that when British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie handed a note to Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita today regarding the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island, Foreign Minister Arita provided a guarantee that this move was of a temporary nature, which was the same as what he told French Ambassador Henry. At the same time, he also expressed dissatisfaction that Britain had been supplying China with military supplies. Ambassador Craigie immediately stated that all these rumors were unfounded. Foreign Minister Arita then declared that British public opinion's support for China had to be regarded as a form of interference. Political figures here commented that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island was a betrayal of its promise, and now it is making various excuses to evade responsibility. (Fourteenth Havas dispatch)

Melbourne After arriving here safely today, Dr. Bennet, a professor of international events at Princeton University in the United States, gave a speech to the press, saying that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is quite important, but he does not believe that Japan will attack Australia. Regarding the issue of Philippine independence, he said that leaders in the U.S. government believe that if the United States allows the Philippines to become fully independent in 1946, it would be like handing the Philippines over to Japan. (Fifteenth Associated Press dispatch)

(Singapore) Today, Sir Thomas, Governor of the Straits Settlements and Commissioner of the Federated Malay States, declared that French officials in Vietnam are particularly concerned about Japan's occupation of Hainan Island. Tang had gone to Siam and Vietnam for a professional visit, flying to Hue in Vietnam to meet with the French Governor-General of Vietnam, before flying back to Singapore from Saigon today. Tang acknowledged that he had discussed the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island with French officials, and he said that French officials were deeply concerned about this situation. He particularly pointed to the impact of the occupation of Hainan Island on France, just as the occupation of an island where Singapore's population is located by another country would have on Britain.

### Izvestia Praises Guangxi's War Preparations

Each County and Village Becomes a Unit of Resistance; When War Breaks Out, Farmers Throughout the Province Will Rise Up Together

(Moscow) Izvestia published a report on Guangxi's province-wide mobilization to prepare for war, saying: "The people of Guangxi are brave and good at fighting, and they do not give up their arms even in peacetime. Since the beginning of China's resistance against Japan, Guangxi has sent 500,000 outstanding sons to the front lines. Military experts who have seen the Guangxi army in action have expressed admiration for the army's bravery, good organization, military technology, and endurance. Recently, when the government took measures to defend Guangxi, the people throughout the province responded enthusiastically. Now, every county and village in Guangxi has become a combat unit. Military training, which was previously unseen, is being carried out uniformly in the countryside. If one sees such preparations for self-defense, one will not believe that the Japanese, knowing that they will encounter such strong resistance, still dare to blindly break into the province. "In Guangxi, in addition to the regular army, there are more than 150,000 well-trained guerrillas led by excellent officers. In the future, when war breaks out, farmers throughout the province will rise up together, carrying guns and going to their designated posts. The guerrillas will go to the mountains and cooperate with the regular army to launch severe attacks on the flanks and rear of the crazed enemy." (Fourteenth TASS dispatch)

Editorial

### Pay Attention to Japan's Conspiracy to Undermine China's Legal Tender

Since launching the war of aggression against China, Japan has implemented various conspiracies to undermine China's legal tender system: First, it issued a large number of military scrip in the guerrilla areas, forcing the Chinese people to use it, intending to depress the value of the legal tender; then, it pretended to be a puppet organization and issued valueless counterfeit currency, intending to use the counterfeit currency to exchange China's foreign exchange,妄想动摇中国法币的基础; Other measures, such as the plunder of private silver deposits in China and the purchase of bank stocks and government bonds, were also used by Japan as a means to undermine China's legal tender. However, because the Chinese government has handled it properly, these kinds of conspiracies have not had much effect. Recently, Japan has had new attempts, In addition to trying to expand the scope of use on the Japanese counterfeit currency, it also counterfeits China's legal tender in order to directly destroy the credit of China's legal tender. According to reports, the legal tender of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank, which were counterfeited in Tokyo, Shanghai and other places, has reached tens of millions of dollars. This kind of counterfeiting of legal tender has recently been discovered on the Shanghai market. The method of using it is said to be mixed into the Japanese army's arrears of pay and the salaries of Japanese puppet agencies, as well as factory wages. Japan's conspiracy to undermine China's legal tender system is becoming more and more vicious! Step by step comes more despicable!

China's legal tender has sufficient gold and silver reserves and is deeply maintained by sympathetic allies; the Chinese government can make extremely quick countermeasures to all Japanese conspiracies: The Chinese people have extremely firm trust in legal tender. Although the circulation of legal tender in North China is suppressed by the Japanese, and the value is stipulated to be reduced to more than 10%, in fact, every 1,000 yuan exchanged for counterfeit "Joint Reserve Notes" must be increased by 15 to 25 yuan, showing that Japan's conspiracy to undermine China's legal tender is a complete waste of effort. Recently, Japan's increasingly active efforts to undermine China's legal tender system are even more indicative of the failure of all past Japanese conspiracies. In order to alleviate the economic crisis in her country, she must think of a way to undermine China's legal tender system. Japan's financial resources are about to reach the point of exhaustion. This year's nearly 10 billion yuan in invasion expenses, in addition to letting the Japanese puppet banknotes and counterfeit legal tender bear a part of the expenditure, it is really difficult to find a better source of wealth than this: and since Japan's financial resources cannot bear a long-term war, when it is currently unable to achieve peace politically and militarily, it can only dream of reducing China's combat capability from the currency in order to achieve a decisive victory in the shortest possible time. In addition, there is also a major effect, that is, to try to eradicate the economic rights and interests of Europe and the United States in China.

Although the use of Japanese puppet banknotes in the Chinese guerrilla areas can now be circulated in cities directly controlled by the Japanese army, Japanese puppet banknotes cannot be freely used in cities outside the cities and in cities related to European and American countries; especially in Shanghai, where international relations are extremely complicated, it was the center of China's commercial, financial and economic activities in the past, and still occupies a very important position economically. Its foreign trade still occupies the first position in all customs in the country. The Japanese are very envious of it, so recently, Japan's active efforts to undermine China's legal tender can be said to be mostly in Shanghai. Japan intends to stop the circulation of legal tender in North China, that is, it is preparing to buy legal tender in North China and exchange it for foreign exchange in Shanghai. The counterfeit legal tender that Japan has privately manufactured is also intended to use Shanghai as its sales venue. It believes that if it obtains the monetary control of Shanghai, it can complete the greatest goal of the "yen bloc". This is the tune that has been chanted in Japan recently.

The conspiracy that Japan is carrying out this time, like before, will definitely not hinder China's entire monetary system. In fact, those who suffer from the damage to China's legal tender are all Chinese and foreign people in the guerrilla areas. Chinese people who accept Japanese puppet banknotes and counterfeit legal tender are equivalent to exchanging their property for some waste paper. European and American merchants in China who accept Japanese puppet banknotes and counterfeit legal tender cannot obtain foreign exchange at all, and they cannot operate at all, so they have to withdraw from China. The fact that European and American merchants could not continue to operate after the legal tender was suppressed by the Japanese in North China is an example.

Not long ago, the Chinese government issued measures to ban Japanese puppet banknotes for Japan's recent efforts to undermine legal tender. All Chinese people and various commercial institutions in the guerrilla areas should refuse the circulation of Japanese puppet banknotes in order to comply with national laws and to protect their own wealth, whether they are forced to use them or not; as for the legal tender counterfeited by Japan, they should immediately try to destroy it when it is discovered, and they should also investigate the source of counterfeit currency from unknown sources and give social sanctions to the traitors, then the credit of the legal tender in the guerrilla areas can still be absolutely preserved. At the same time, it is hoped that European and American merchants in China should also take united action with the Chinese people in order to maintain their own economic interests and jointly smash Japan's conspiracy to undermine China's legal tender!

### Chen Cheng Talks About the Overall Situation of the War of Resistance; Absolute Confidence in Military Matters; In the Future, When Japan Knelt Down, It Would Be Time for China to Negotiate Peace

(Hong Kong) Chen Cheng talked about the overall situation of the War of Resistance. He first described the progress of the War of Resistance for more than a year and a half, saying that we have achieved the goal of sustained attrition. Then, he talked about the favorable international situation for us, and discussed the strength of our enemy and the comparison of casualties. Finally, he said that he dared to be responsible for reporting that we have a comprehensive plan for military affairs, and that we have absolute confidence no matter where the enemy comes from. The War of Resistance is like a revolution, and we must persist to the end and succeed. As a result of the first phase of the War of Resistance, we will surely have greater gains in sustained attrition in the future. Even if the enemy wants to invade our Nanning and Xi'an, it is by no means something that can be imagined in the short term. In short, at most two years or as little as one year, we will surely win the final victory. War and peace are originally one thing. Only by being able to fight can we make peace. In the future, when Japan kneels down, it will be time for us to negotiate peace. (Fifteenth dispatch)

I dare to guarantee to you that the Mongolians who understand the current situation, especially the intellectuals of Inner Mongolia, will not be tempted by the Japanese and cooperate with the invaders. They have organized the strong men of Inner Mongolia into guerrilla units, providing them with military and political training to attack the Japanese. The patriotic movement in western Inner Mongolia is extremely enthusiastic, causing many Mongolian combat teams who have gone astray to turn back. These returning teams and their commanders are warmly welcomed by the representatives of the central government of each banner. They are now the vanguard of the counterattack against the Japanese army. The number of pro-Japanese elements is very small, and they are under the strict surveillance of the Japanese side. I would like to prove to you that Inner Mongolia is a part of the Republic of China. Even if it is oppressed by the Japanese side, it will never be deceived and secede from the Republic of China. The Mongolians are willing to arm themselves to resist Japan in order to defend China and protect the integrity of China's territory.

### 200 Chinese Tanks Purchased Have Arrived in Rangoon on American Ships; British Officials Advocate Further Assistance to China; US Committee Discusses Chinese Loans

Rangoon: A batch of light tanks purchased by China, totaling 200, has recently arrived here on an American ship. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 15th)

(London) The Export Credits Guarantee Department Expansion of Powers Bill (the main point of which is to increase the guarantee amount from 50 million pounds to 75 million pounds) was passed by the House of Commons on the 2nd of this month after the third reading. The House of Lords passed the second reading today. (Dispatch from Havas on the 14th)

(London) During the discussion of the export guarantee bill in the House of Lords today, China was mentioned. The bill was then passed by the second reading. Lord Monckton-croft agreed with the bill. He first stated that Britain had invested millions of pounds in Mexico and South America without receiving interest, and then stated that China was very willing and attempted to treat people with honesty. After the end of the war in the Far East, China must engage in reconstruction, and China would have difficulty raising funds on its own, but Britain should assist it with export credit loans. However, the amount of 75 million pounds is far from enough. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 14th)

(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Handiemiao, a member of the opposition Labor Party, asked Commerce Secretary Stanley about the state of British trade in Manchuria. He asked whether the government had discussed a plan to eliminate various difficulties. Stanley replied immediately that since the implementation of exchange controls in Manchuria, British exports to the area have been significantly affected and have tended to decline. The other interests held by Britain, such as oil, shipping, and insurance, have also been affected. The government is closely monitoring this matter. (Dispatch from Havas on the 14th)

(Washington) The Senate Banking Committee passed a bill today to extend the privileges enjoyed by the US Federal Financial Reconstruction Corporation to June 30, 1941. In addition, an agreement on extending the effective period of the privileges enjoyed by the Export-Import Bank could not be reached, and it was immediately decided to postpone it to the 21st of this month. The reason is that the Republican members had declared at the meeting that the lending facilities retained by the bank were not used for purely banking business, but to support the government's current foreign policy, which was not the case. The president of the bank, Jones, tried his best to expand the scope of activities and said that the bank had recently lent 25,000,000 US dollars to China and 5,000,000 US dollars to Haiti. These loans were used to purchase American goods. The Chinese government had previously obtained several loans, and a part of them had already been repaid in full. The conclusion was that the bank had never violated the current Neutrality Act and the Johnson Act when lending to foreign countries. According to the Johnson Act, countries that have defaulted on debts to the United States may not be lent funds again. (Dispatch from Havas on the 14th)

(Washington) Republican Senator Taft attacked the Export-Import Bank in the Senate Banking Committee today, saying that the bank's current plan is actually to keep Congress in the dark and create another European war with economic power. Taft then questioned Reconstruction Bank President Jones whether the bank's policy was to follow commercial rules or to act as an instrument of American foreign policy. Jones replied that the bank had absolutely no place to act as an instrument of foreign policy. Later, although the committee extended the term of the Reconstruction Bank to June 1941, it still needs to fully consider the extension of the terms of the Property Credit Bureau and the Export-Import Bank. According to Jones, American loans to China have reached 37,000,000 US dollars to date, and 14,400,000 US dollars have been repaid. Some members asked whether the loans to China were initiated by President Roosevelt. Jones replied, "I have never asked President Roosevelt for instructions on the matter of loans to China." At the same time, he firmly believed that this move did not violate the Neutrality Act or the Johnson Act in any way. (Dispatch from the US Associated Press on the 14th)

### British Churches Sympathetic to China; Anonymous Donor Donates 30,000 Yuan

(London) The Far East Committee of British Missionary Societies met on the 20th of last month to discuss the issue of relief for Chinese refugees. It was immediately decided to raise funds for relief expenses. Since the appeal was issued, people from all over have enthusiastically donated to support it. Today, it received another donation of 900 pounds (approximately 30,000 Chinese yuan) from an anonymous person in Scotland. Therefore, the funds raised by the meeting have reached a total of 175,000 pounds, approximately 5 million Chinese yuan. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 15th)

### British and Dutch Foreign Ministers Agree on Joint Defense Measures; British Statement Cannot Ignore the Netherlands and the East Indies

(London) It has recently been widely rumored that Germany has the intention of invading the Netherlands, and the Dutch East Indies is also feeling threatened by Japan. The Dutch government has exchanged views with the British government through diplomatic channels. Dutch Foreign Minister Badtian also came here today to attend the unveiling ceremony of the monument to Dutch jurist Grotius (17th century), taking the opportunity to hold talks with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately informed him that the British Cabinet had recently declared a principle, that is, if the independence of Belgium and the Netherlands is threatened, then the interests of Britain's survival will also be affected. If the Netherlands or the Dutch East Indies is attacked, Britain will not be able to stand idly by. The two sides then referred to the shared interests of Britain and the Netherlands in the Far East, discussed the security of the Dutch East Indies, and planned to upgrade their respective embassies to embassies. Britain's concern for the independence of the Netherlands can be seen from this. In addition, the British and French governments are exchanging views on the issue of upgrading their embassies in the Netherlands and will make a decision at the same time.

### US House of Representatives Discusses Expanding Military Preparations, First Discussing the Air Force Portion

(Washington) The military expansion bill based on President Roosevelt's defense message has been reviewed and passed by the House Armed Services Committee. The House of Representatives submitted it for discussion today. Its content advocates using 552,000,000 US dollars to strengthen national defense, of which 300,000,000 US dollars will be used to expand the air force and build 3,032 military aircraft of various types, so that the number of US Air Force aircraft will increase to 5,500. Among them, 10,000,000 US dollars will be used to train civilian aviation pilots, and 27,000,000 US dollars will be used to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone. The remaining 22,000,000 US dollars will be used to order various military supplies from private factories to train workers so that these factories can be converted into military steel factories in the event of an emergency. The House of Representatives first discussed the Air Force portion today. The members generally had no objections. Even the opposition members strongly stated that the strength of the US Navy and Air Force must be strengthened. They also expressed their approval for increasing the number of air force aircraft to 5,500. However, some members advocated ordering them gradually so that all military aircraft would not become obsolete in the future. The Army authorities intend to order 3,000 aircraft at one time so that the factories can adopt mass production methods and reduce the cost. The Republican leaders took the opportunity to explain the party's proposed foreign policy, the main points of which were to defend the American continent and avoid concluding alliance treaties with other countries. Some members mentioned the sale of American aircraft to Britain and France, but did not raise serious objections. Mei, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and a Democratic member, said that the crisis of the United States being invaded is becoming increasingly imminent. Britain and France have now become the only remaining democratic countries in Europe. If they fail in the future, they will undoubtedly be fascist. The current US military expansion plan is mainly for self-preservation and has no aggressive meaning. Another member of the committee, Democratic member Mald, also said that the German aircraft industry has a total of 200,000 workers, while the United States only has 17,000 workers, which is dwarfed in comparison. During the discussion in the House of Representatives today, most members believed that the bill would be passed in its entirety, and many left their seats and went to the lounge. People in the lounge said that it would not be difficult to obtain a large majority when the bill is voted on. (Dispatch from Havas on the 14th)

(Washington) The House is now debating an emergency defense expenditure of 75 million US dollars. The passage of the bill can be predicted. The Republicans, with the exception of minor criticisms, abide by the Republican doctrine resolution of last week and unanimously support the plan. Democrat Thomson made the highest estimate of the strength of foreign military aircraft, saying that Germany currently has 9,800, Britain 7,100, the Soviet Union 5,500, Italy 4,000, Japan 3,100, and France 2,700. This estimate has not yet been made by anyone. Thomson also said that the United States currently has 3,500 aircraft. The main approval case will now stipulate that the US Army will increase its aircraft by 3,000. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 15th)

### North African Troop Increase Question: Britain Again Questions Italy; Italian Authorities Admit Increase to Over 60,000; Prior Notification and Agreement Violated

(London) Responsible sources recently stated that when the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Percy Loraine, held talks with the Italian Foreign Minister, Ciano, yesterday, the main topic of discussion was the military situation in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa. The Foreign Minister Ciano was informed that Italy's increase in troop levels in the area without prior notification to Britain violated the agreed-upon exchange of military intelligence between Britain and Italy, and also posed a threat to the French territories in North Africa. Foreign Minister Ciano immediately replied that the reason for increasing the troop strength in Libya from 28,000 to 61,000 was because France had increased its troop levels in Tunisia and concentrated troops in southern Tunisia, leaving no other choice. Once the situation there returned to normal, the troop strength in Libya would be reduced to below 30,000. Ambassador Loraine then stated that the information Italy had received regarding the increase in French troops in Tunisia was not necessarily reliable, but Foreign Minister Ciano refused to continue the discussion. Ambassador Loraine also said that the anti-French propaganda campaign being conducted by Italian newspapers, as well as the absurd demands put forward by the "International Relations" weekly (namely, that France should cede Tunisia, Gibraltar, Corsica, and Nice to Italy), were detrimental to Italian-French relations, and also affected Anglo-Italian relations. Foreign Minister Ciano also replied immediately that the tension in Italian-French relations was due to the tone of the newspapers in both France and Italy, for which the government could not be held responsible. In short, Foreign Minister Ciano refused to provide any concrete assurances on the above points, and as a result, those responsible here are very anxious about the true intentions of the Italian government. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

(Paris) The right-wing Figaro recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating, "The Italian-German-Japanese Tripartite Alliance is indeed taking practical action, not just empty words. As far as Italy is concerned, after the British Ambassador, Sir Percy Loraine, raised the issue the other day, the Italian Foreign Minister, Ciano, has confirmed that the troop strength in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa has been increased to 60,000, and indicated that it may continue to increase. As for Germany, according to recent news from Berlin, the mobilization of the German Air Force is nearing completion, and the Army General Staff has reportedly decided to implement a 'gradual mobilization' plan to be fully completed around March 15. As for Japan, it has already occupied Hainan Island to threaten French Vietnam and British territories. Looking at international developments in recent weeks, this is the most noteworthy."

### British Budget: £1 Billion; Defense Spending Accounts for Half

(London) The total amount of the next British budget will reach around £1 billion, of which approximately £500 million will be used for defense. The raising of funds for defense needs has been under consideration for some time, as it is clear that this amount cannot be fully funded by taxes or borrowing. The government's borrowing power is currently limited to an average of £80 million per year. It is reported that the government will publish a white paper today, outlining its major defense plans and proposals for raising these funds. The House of Commons will begin debating the defense issue next week, and it is expected that the necessary legislation will be passed based on the financial resolutions. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### France Continues to Purchase Aircraft from the United States: Already 615 Aircraft

(Washington) The French Embassy in the United States recently issued a public announcement, stating, "After the French Air Force delegation came to the United States last summer to order the first batch of aircraft, it arrived here again in December of last year to continue purchasing aircraft. This has now been completed, with a total of more than 500 aircraft ordered from the Douglas, Curtiss, Glenn Martin, and North American Aviation factories in the United States." According to responsible sources, France has ordered 615 aircraft from the United States since last summer, including 200 Curtiss fighter planes, 115 Glenn Martin light bombers, 200 light bombers and training aircraft manufactured by North American, and 100 Douglas heavy bombers. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Bustamante requested that a fruit company dismiss the worker, but the company refused, and he then announced a strike, which has now spread throughout the island. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Romania: Internal Troubles Continue; Iron Guard Remnants Remain

(Rome) Two young members of the Iron Guard crashed an airplane near the Bucharest airfield and were injured. They were sent to the aviation hospital. Police discovered that the plane was equipped with enough gasoline for a flight of over 600 miles, and they also reportedly found a large number of Iron Guard propaganda materials and illegal documents such as letters sent by Iron Guard members who had fled the country. When the police visited the aviation hospital to investigate, they found that the two men were talking with five beautiful women. It was reported that some of these women included the wives of Iron Guard members, one of whom was a fugitive wanted after being sentenced to imprisonment. Two other women were socialites in Bucharest. Police then found important letters near the two young men. It is believed that if these letters had not been seized by the police, they would have been taken away by these five women. (Reuters, 15th)

### Hungary: Cabinet Resigns En Masse; Anti-Jewish Policy Fails

The Hungarian capital The semi-official Hungarian News Agency recently issued a message stating that the cabinet held a meeting at 9:30 this morning, and upon the proposal of Prime Minister Imrédy, it was immediately decided to resign en masse. Prime Minister Imrédy then met with Regent Horthy after the meeting and submitted his resignation, which Regent Horthy immediately accepted. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

○ The Hungarian capital The sudden resignation of Prime Minister Imrédy has resulted in the indefinite postponement of the parliamentary session, which was originally scheduled to be held today, and which included a discussion of the government's proposed anti-Jewish bill. Regarding this matter, observers here recently stated that the reason for the cabinet's downfall is that Regent Horthy is exceptionally resolute. Despite "external forces," he is determined to maintain the national interest and will not allow other countries to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. In other words, the Catholic doctrines that the Hungarian people should adhere to have overcome heresy, and humanitarianism has triumphed over narrow-minded racism. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

(Paris) The resignation of the Imrédy cabinet in Hungary is generally regarded here as a major event in preventing Germany from expanding its influence in Southeast Europe. Hungarian Prime Minister Imrédy is similar to the recently resigned Prime Minister Stojadinović of Yugoslavia, as both are known for being pro-German. His departure can be considered another warning to Germany. The Hungarian parliament was originally scheduled to discuss the anti-Jewish bill proposed by Prime Minister Imrédy tomorrow, but this has now been postponed indefinitely. This bill was not only supported by the German government but also instigated by Berlin. It had two objectives: one was to promote the theory of racism, and the other was to completely halt Hungarian industry, as the Hungarian industrial sector is dominated by Jews. Once they are expelled, Hungary will have no choice but to comply with Germany's proposed Danube River economic organization plan and revert to its status as an agricultural country. This German plan has been opposed by Hungarian Catholics, and Prime Minister Imrédy's proposed agricultural reform measures would make the Hungarian landowners share the same fate as the German landowners, which is unsettling to the conservatives. Therefore, various parties loyal to the Hungarian traditional spirit and advocating the preservation of national independence have gradually distanced themselves from Prime Minister Imrédy. With such internal centrifugal tendencies, and Prime Minister Imrédy's decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Soviet government severed diplomatic relations with Hungary on the grounds that the Hungarian government had lost its freedom of action under the pressure of various totalitarian states. This move has greatly harmed Hungary's national honor, and has been another important reason for Prime Minister Imrédy's criticism. In addition, when Hungary and Czechoslovakia had a border dispute last November, Germany strongly opposed the idea of Hungary and Poland sharing a border, and finally convened the Vienna Conference and resolved the matter through arbitration. This attitude of Germany has been widely criticized by Hungarian public opinion. Furthermore, although Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky visited Berlin on the 19th of last month and conducted talks with the German authorities, after which it was confirmed that Germany and Hungary would pursue a unified policy on diplomacy, the Hungarian government has not yet formally signed the Anti-Comintern Pact (although the Hungarian cabinet has decided to join, it has not yet held the signing ceremony), and it is still a member of the League of Nations, indicating that Germany and Hungary are not yet fully in sync in their actions. This is also a reason why Prime Minister Imrédy is unpopular. The Standing Political Council of the Balkan Entente countries, namely Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece, is scheduled to meet in the Romanian capital on the 20th of this month. With the cabinet crisis in Hungary, it will undoubtedly have an impact on this meeting. To date, Romania and Yugoslavia have disputes with Hungary over the Hungarian minority issue within their borders. From now on, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Hungary can prevent Germany from expanding its influence in Southeast Europe and should be able to approach each other. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### Spanish Foreign Minister Arrives in Paris Again Yesterday; French Representative Visits Nationalist Authorities Again; The Times Advises Ceasefire and Reconstruction

(Paris) The Spanish Republican Government Foreign Minister del Vayo arrived here from Madrid this morning and immediately met with the country's President Azaña for talks. It is reported that Azaña opposes continuing the war and disagrees with Prime Minister Negrín. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

(London) The cabinet held a meeting this morning to consider the recent developments in Spain. Political circles feel that a decision to recognize the Nationalist government will not be made until the situation in Spain becomes clearer. Yesterday, in addition to deciding to instruct the unofficial representative, Senator Bérard, to return to Burgos to continue discussions, the French cabinet did not make a final decision. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to a question from Labour MP Henderson in the House of Commons today, saying that the British government earnestly hopes that the Spanish civil war will end and that there will be no more bloodshed. If necessary, the British government is willing to continue to engage with both sides to bring them closer together, but the British side believes that there is no need to take responsibility for proposing specific solutions. The Prime Minister later replied to various questions about recognizing the Nationalist government, saying that this matter is still under consideration by the government, so he could not provide further details. Later, another MP asked whether the British side intends to take joint action with the French government and issue a statement at the same time. The Prime Minister replied that he would defer his answer. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

(London) The Times commented today on the issue of recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government, saying that the Republican government is now a mere facade, and the war has become an unconscious act. It is time to end the heroic resistance and the long history of murderous crimes to start national reconstruction. When Britain selects an ambassador to be stationed in Spain in the future, it should choose a person of extremely high reputation, as this is obviously extremely important. Regarding the issue of domestic and foreign troops in Spain, if the withdrawal of foreign troops is made a condition for recognizing the Nationalist government, it would be tantamount to inducing Germany and Italy to permanently leave thousands of troops in Spain, causing difficulties between the British and Spanish governments. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

(London) Last night, it was officially stated that rumors that the British government was guaranteeing loans for the Spanish Nationalist government were unfounded. In fact, major London banks have been providing credit loans to the Nationalist government for more than a year, and the total amount has reached several million pounds. Among the five major banks in London, at least two have financial relations with the Nationalist government. (Haitong, 15th)

(London) The Post Office announced today that postal services between Britain and the territories controlled by the Spanish Republican government have been suspended, but postal services are still available with the territories controlled by the Spanish Nationalist government. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

(Paris) Responsible sources recently stated that Right-wing Republican Union Senator Feraire will go to the city of Burgos in Spain within days on an official mission to prepare for the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and the Nationalist government. Once the political and legal situation is favorable, the French government will formally recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government and appoint Feraire as ambassador, with a term of six months (French parliamentarians are usually appointed for a term of six months when serving as ambassadors to other countries during their terms). Regarding this matter, the State Council today granted Foreign Minister Bonnet the authority to act at his discretion so that he could seek the consent of the British government at the appropriate time before legally recognizing the Nationalist government. Earlier, several cabinet members expressed their views at the State Council, saying that the Spanish government forces are still fighting, and France should not negotiate with the Nationalist government. Other cabinet members said that General Franco may have accepted restrictions from the totalitarian states, and even if he provides promises to Britain and France, they may not be worth much. Still other cabinet members said that it is not appropriate to deal with the Nationalist government with a completely passive attitude or to legally recognize it at this time. As a compromise, it was decided to send Feraire to the city of Burgos. Sources here commented that there are three benefits to France establishing unofficial and regular relations with the Nationalist government: 1. France can maintain its current relations with the Republican government. 2. Since France has established relations with both sides involved in the Spanish civil war, it can contribute to the pacification of Spain. 3. Even for the Nationalist government, in addition to establishing relations with the totalitarian states, it should also interact with other countries in order to protect Spain's independence. 4. Italy should formally make demands on France, and France needs to establish relations with the Spanish Nationalist government. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

(Paris) Rumors that the French government has issued an ultimatum to the Spanish Republican Government Prime Minister Negrín, demanding unconditional surrender in order to end the country's civil war as soon as possible, and that the French government is negotiating with Germany and Italy, have been denied by officials here. Although some important French figures have traveled to Germany and Italy recently, none of them were on a special mission. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

The Argentinian capital According to reliable sources, Brazilian Ambassador Silva met with Argentinian President Ortiz to exchange views on the situation in Spain and the recognition of the Nationalist government as the legitimate government by Argentina and Brazil.

Only the Pope's attendants, the diplomatic corps, and other officials attended. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### February 22nd: French President to Visit London; British Prime Minister Officially Announces; Grand Preparations for Welcome

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the British government has made preparations to host French President Lebrun and his wife on March 23rd so that members of Parliament can join in a special welcome. The whole House cheered in approval. The visit by French President Lebrun and his wife is in return for the visit to France by the King and Queen last year. They are scheduled to arrive at Victoria Station in the United Kingdom on March 21st. The King and Queen will both be present at the station to welcome them. After leaving the station, they will drive to Buckingham Palace and then pay a visit to Queen Mary. The program of hospitality planned by the British side includes a luncheon hosted by the Lord Mayor of London at the Guildhall, a reception by the London City Council, a performance at the Covent Garden Opera House, a luncheon hosted by the King and Queen at Windsor Castle, a banquet at the Foreign Office, a reception hosted by the British government, and a banquet hosted by the India Office. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

(London) French President Lebrun and his wife are scheduled to come here on the 23rd of next month in return for the visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. On that day at noon, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth will host a banquet in the Grand Hall of Windsor Castle. Since 1914, this will be the first time that the King has hosted a foreign head of state in this hall, making it a grand occasion. After the meal, the King and Queen will lead President Lebrun and his wife, along with the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Airlie, and the Vice-Chamberlain, Lord Wigram, to tour the various rooms, six of which are reserved for foreign heads of state to stay. President Lebrun and his wife will be staying there. The carvings on the ceilings, the various famous paintings, furnishings, and tapestries are magnificent and are all the best of their time. Other antiques, such as the block on which King Charles I was beheaded and the shield presented by French King Francis I to King Henry VIII, are particularly historically meaningful. The other rooms contain collections of 17th-century Chinese porcelain and carpets, as well as famous paintings by Rubens, Van Dyck, and other masters, which are priceless. Rubens Hall is draped in scarlet silk curtains and decorated with a portrait of King Philip II of Spain, which is also beautiful. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### US to Brazil: Preparing to Lend Money

(Washington) Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha continued to hold talks with Under Secretary of State Welles at 10:30 this morning. U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Caffery was also present. The talks lasted for two and a half hours and focused on various political issues. After lunch, Foreign Minister Aranha also met with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Ambassador Caffery and Jones, President of the U.S. Federal Finance Reconstruction Corporation and General Manager of the Export-Import Bank, also participated. Political figures here have stated that Jones' participation in the talks shows that the Export-Import Bank is preparing to lend money to Brazil. Brazil has failed to repay its debts to the United States as scheduled, so the United States has refused to grant the country new loans. During his visit, Foreign Minister Aranha submitted a memorandum to the U.S. Department of State and the Treasury Department, proposing to swap these old debts for new debts in order to facilitate the continued repayment of principal and interest in the future. The argument he put forward was that in 1931, Brazil's trade surplus reached a huge £20 million, but by 1937, it had decreased to £1 million. From 1928 to 1937, all the surplus earnings over the years have been used to repay the principal and interest on foreign debts. The domestic capital is scarce, and all industries are in decline, which is unavoidable. Therefore, it is necessary to reorganize the old debts in order to have hope of recovery.

### Military and Political Conference in Guangdong Province Decides on Principles of Guerrilla Self-Defense; Guerrilla Commanders and Administrative Commissioners Attend to Organize Provincial Self-Defense Corps to Strengthen Resistance

Shaoguan Dispatch: Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, Yu Hanmou, Director of Guangdong Pacification, and Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, convened a military and political conference in Shaoguan on the first of this month to consolidate Guangdong's military and political plans and to prioritize the province's overall guerrilla self-defense in the war against Japan. Senior military officers were summoned to participate, and administrative commissioners from various districts were ordered to attend. Each commissioner was required to compile a report on their significant work from the past three months and present a written report on their administrative work at the conference for review and to determine future reforms. After the meeting began on that day, Zhang Fakui delivered an opening speech, detailing the purpose of the conference and urging all members to express their opinions and contribute their expertise. Yu Hanmou and Li Hanhun then delivered speeches, mainly elaborating on the purpose of the conference. Finally, more than ten guerrilla commanders from the war zone and administrative commissioners from various districts reported on their operational and administrative experiences and current situations, followed by a break. That evening, Zhang Fakui emphasized the importance of the "Guangdong Province Overall Guerrilla Self-Defense Issue" among the many key cases to be discussed at the conference. He presented the established principles for small group discussions on the second, to exchange opinions, before submitting them for discussion. The conference concluded on the third, resulting in the adoption of six principles for the reorganization plan. The organization of the Self-Defense Corps will operate under that name within non-war zones, and as guerrilla units in war zones. The merger of the Self-Defense Corps was discussed. The Self-Defense Corps has recently been ordered to be transferred to the provincial government, which has established a Fifth Section to take over. The Self-Defense Corps Management Office of the Fourth War Zone (Deputy Director of the original Management Office, Zhang Erchao, was appointed as the head of the Fifth Section, in charge of the grain, military supplies, and unified supply matters of the teams, with three units under the section) and the respective Self-Defense Corps teams will be directly subordinate to the counties, under the command of the administrative commissioner and guerrilla commander. The Self-Defense Corps in the war zone will remain concentrated (i.e., guerrilla units), while the Self-Defense Corps in the non-war zone will implement general training. The Self-Defense Corps near the war zone will undergo intensive training. There are detailed demarcations of war zone, non-war zone, and adjacent war zone areas. The entire province is divided into more than twenty brigades (according to previous records before being transferred to the provincial government, the entire province had fifty-five brigades, governing one hundred and sixty-five companies, and another fifteen directly subordinate companies), with a larger distribution in the war zone, accounting for more than one-third of the total. The district guerrilla headquarters and county guerrilla command headquarters were abolished on February 1st. The district headquarters were handed over to the respective administrative commissioners, and the county command headquarters were handed over to the respective county and city bureau chiefs. In the future, the division of guerrilla zones will follow the administrative district method, with the entire province divided into nine district commands, concurrently held by the administrative inspector commissioner, with a deputy commander to assist in the affairs. The Self-Defense Corps is managed by the counties and is uniformly under the command and control of the district commander to which they are subordinate. The provincial government is the highest authority and is subject to the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone. The Self-Defense Corps in the war zone will liaise with the local defense forces and be subject to their command. The Self-Defense Corps in the non-war zone and adjacent war zone will still be commanded by the provincial government, but all supplies and replenishments will be properly arranged by the provincial government. The total expenses for the Self-Defense Corps is 250,000 yuan per month, including concentration, intensive training, and general training, with concentration and intensive training accounting for the majority, and general training only receiving office expenses. This expenditure is the minimum, and will not be reduced under any circumstances. If necessary, the situation will be assessed, and appropriate increases may be made. As for various budgets and expenditure amounts, they will also be separately compiled into forms. Training issues will involve establishing training programs based on the required situation, improving training efficiency, and cultivating the strength of the guerrilla forces, especially general training, which can mobilize members at any time to undertake guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla tactics are closely related to the timing, geography, and human factors. The situation in Guangdong Province is slightly different from other provinces, and the application of guerrilla tactics will also be completely and precisely determined. Since the names of the former district guerrilla headquarters have been abolished, and the respective commanders are military talents, during this war of resistance, when the country needs talents, the respective commanders will also be assigned military positions. After the above principles were resolved, the meeting was adjourned on the third. At the closing ceremony, the three commanders, Zhang, Yu, and Li, once again summarized the achievements of the meeting, read them to the attending members, and offered sincere encouragement. On the fourth, the members returned to their defense posts to handle all matters. Furthermore, since Guangdong Province has been invaded by the Japanese army, the wealthy counties have been ravaged, greatly affecting the provincial treasury's income. It is reported that the current monthly income is less than one million yuan. After this military and political conference, the military and political authorities have rigorously implemented streamlining and merging redundant positions to reduce expenses. Even the Security and Anti-Smuggling Departments have been tightened up, so the financial situation is gradually improving. (February 5th)

### Japanese Naval and Air Forces Invade Ports in Hainan Island; Japanese Troops Have Landed at Haikou City and Qinglan Port, Aiming to Threaten Britain and France

Hong Kong Dispatch: The Japanese army has been plotting in southern Guangdong Province for a long time, using Weizhou Island as a base. The Japanese commanders Kashiura and Yoshida, the brigade commander, are permanently stationed on the island to deploy and arrange troops. Last month, Japanese warships and transport ships sailed from Taiwan, Xiamen, and various places in the Pearl River to Weizhou Island. On the first of this month, more military supplies were transported, accompanied by more than ten Japanese engineers. At that time, intelligence indicated that the Japanese army would choose a location to land. In the past two days, the shipping industry here has received wireless telegraph reports from ships anchored outside Haikou Port on Hainan Island, stating that from 4 AM on the 10th, the Japanese army on Weizhou Island suddenly landed on Hainan Island. One landing site was Qinglan Port in Wenchang County, one was Lingao County in the northwest of the island, and one was Haikou City in Qiongshan County. At the same time, it was also heard that Yulin Naval Port in the southernmost part of the island was also attacked by the Japanese army. The Japanese army used naval, land, and air forces to launch a four-sided siege. At Haikou and Qinglan Port, Japanese warships launched surprise artillery attacks, and more than ten Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombed the areas. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, and the rumbling of artillery fire from Lingao was also heard in Haikou. However, the Chinese army, in coordination with the people, resolutely resisted and were very brave, but the coastal defense lines were mostly destroyed, making it impossible to defend for long. The Chinese army in Haikou City and Qinglan Port first transferred their positions, and the Japanese army landed at these two locations on the afternoon of the 10th.

Traffic between Hong Kong and Hainan Island was cut off after the Japanese army invaded the island, and telegraph communications were disrupted starting on the 10th. Taikoo Steamship Company has temporarily suspended the sailings of the Jiangsu, Meinan, and Guangdong ships, which were originally scheduled to sail to Haikou on the 11th and 12th. Therefore, the attack on the island has had a significant impact on Hong Kong. According to observations from those familiar with the situation on the island, the purpose of the Japanese army's invasion of Hainan Island is to threaten French Indochina and British Southeast Asia, and they have apparently resolved to challenge Britain and France. It is also heard that some factions within the Japanese military have long advocated occupying the island. Another faction advocates occupying the island as a base for Japan's advance towards the Annam border, to prevent European and American military supplies from entering mainland China through Annam. However, these far-fetched dreams will only accelerate their path to collapse. Therefore, the Japanese army's decision to invade the island has transformed the Sino-Japanese issue into an international issue.

### Japanese Army in Tianjin Oppresses White Russians; British and French Merchants Also Suffer Significant Losses

The China Press reports: Yesterday (the 14th), a well-known Russian merchant who came to Shanghai from Tianjin said that for many months, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have adopted a "Unless you join the Anti-Communist Association, then..." attitude towards the local White Russians. The White Russians in Tianjin, facing the threat of severe retaliation from the Japanese authorities, were forced to join the association. Those who refused to join have been subjected to harsh treatment by the Japanese, including imprisonment. Foreign merchants in Tianjin, especially British and French merchants, have suffered considerable losses each month due to Japanese restrictions on their trade. However, the White Russians in Tianjin are also among those who have suffered significant losses. Since the Japanese army occupied Tianjin, they have imposed restrictions on the White Russians that have not been widely known, such as expelling many Russian expatriates from the area under the pretext of opposing the new "government." The White Russians were forced to join the Anti-Communist Association, and a portion of their salaries was also confiscated to fund the association, but to date, the association has not issued a statement of its income and expenses. The treatment of those who do not wish to join the association can be illustrated by the example of the well-known Russian expatriate in Tianjin, Sibeinov. Sibeinov was arrested by the Japanese on a pretext a month ago and immediately imprisoned. He only managed to secure his release after paying a large sum of money. This amount was largely Sibeinov's membership fee for joining the Anti-Communist Association, as he has not been harassed since then. Members are charged fees according to their salaries, and those who do not pay are subjected to retaliation. The Japanese authorities impose harsh retaliation on White Russians who do not join the association. Sibeinov's beating during his imprisonment is clear evidence of this. Another example is the prohibition of White Russians from leaving Tianjin and the confiscation of their certificates. Therefore, although White Russians who join the association claim to support its principles, this is not the case, as they are forced to join regardless of their wishes. Last year, the Japanese collected 500,000 yuan from the White Russians, ostensibly to pay for the White Russians hired to protect roads and telegraphs, but no one knows how the money was actually spent. Every White Russian earning 100 yuan per month is forced to pay the association one yuan, with higher earners paying more. In addition, the association levies fees on the White Russians at any time for its various activities. All Russian merchants in Tianjin are forced to conduct banking transactions with a certain Japanese bank and can only use the "Joint Reserve Bank" counterfeit currency. Those who do not comply are subjected to severe retaliation. Therefore, the Russian expatriates live in fear and cannot act as they please. They are often insulted when entering another concession from the one they are in. The Russian merchant also mentioned the current situation in Tianjin, stating that the Japanese are still restricting foreign-owned businesses, and the order for Japanese people to withdraw from the British and French concessions has almost been completed. However, several large Japanese trading houses that will face significant losses have not yet moved out. The searches of Chinese people entering the Japanese-controlled area from the two concessions continue, and foreigners are sometimes searched as well. Restrictions are especially strict on the roads leading to the old Russian concession. As a result, business within the concessions has suffered greatly since Tianjin was occupied. All travelers arriving at Tianjin Station, whether Chinese or foreign, are forced to receive vaccinations if they do not have vaccination certificates, and travelers arriving at the station are interrogated severely by armed guards, even foreigners. The Japanese take these precautions out of fear that guerrilla units will try to enter their controlled area. Arson incidents occur almost daily in the Japanese-controlled area, and heavy gunfire is heard in these areas at night. The Japanese army seems unable to contain its opposing guerrilla units. Irregular Chinese troops and Japanese garrison troops frequently engage in fierce battles. Another method of exclusion used by the Japanese is to obstruct foreign ships from entering the port. As a result, shops in the British and French concessions suffer unnecessary losses due to these unnecessary restrictions. The larger shops in Tianjin still use legal tender as the medium of trade. The Russian merchant concluded by saying that since the Japanese army occupied Tianjin, the situation has deteriorated rapidly, and there seems to be little hope for improvement.

### Xiang-Gui Railway Under Construction; Japanese Aircraft Bomb Yong-Long Section; Bridges in Ningming County Bombed; No Impact on Entire Line

Guangxi Dispatch: The Xiang-Gui Railway line starts from Hengyang in Hunan Province and is being built in four sections: one from Hengyang to Guilin, one from Guilin to Liuzhou, one from Liuzhou to Nanning, and one from Nanning to Zhennanguan in Longzhou, which connects with the railway at Wenyuan Station in Vietnam five miles beyond the border. On October 10th of last year, the section from Quzhou to Guilin was already open to traffic, but the Guilin-Liuzhou-Yong-Long sections have not yet been completed. The focus of the war of resistance in South China has shifted to Guangxi. For the convenience of military transportation, the Guangxi authorities have mobilized 200,000 civilian laborers to work day and night on the entire line, aiming to complete the entire project within one year. Currently, the roadbed of the entire line is mostly completed. The largest project is the section from Nanning to Zhennanguan, starting from Dingzixu south of Yongning County, passing through Funan, Suilu, Sile, Mingjiang, Ningming, Pingxiang, and out of Zhennanguan. After the route reaches Ningming, a branch line is built to reach Longzhou. The reason why this section of the line bypasses Sile and Ningming on the south bank of the Zuojiang River is to avoid the stone mountains and steep peaks in the Chongshan, Leiping, and Longzhou areas on the north bank, reducing excavation work and saving time and money. Therefore, a branch line is used from Ningming to connect to Longzhou. However, the bridge construction project connecting Ningming and Pingxiang is also quite large. While these bridges were being built at an accelerated pace, the Japanese army suddenly sent two reconnaissance planes to take off from the Beihai waters and enter Longzhou along Qinzhou. They then reconnoitered the area along the Long-Yong road, passing over Mingjiang and Ningming. After this reconnaissance, on the 26th of last month, eight aircraft were sent again, taking off from the Beihai waters, following the same reconnaissance route, and flying directly to Ningming, dropping more than ten bombs on the bridges of the Yong-Long railway line southwest of the city. Several road workers were injured, but fortunately, the bridges on the line were not destroyed. The Japanese army attacked the station, attempting to destroy it in order to hinder the progress of the project because Ningming Station is the transportation hub for the Yong-Long branch line and the direct line to Zhennanguan, and the Japanese military surmised that the completion of this line would greatly enhance military strength in the Southwest Theater of Operations. Ningming is located in the remote southwestern corner of Guangxi Province, with dangerous roads and inconvenient transportation, and information is isolated. Even those concerned about current events rarely pay attention to it, but little do they know that such a small and remote county also has a significant impact on military transportation. According to a railway engineer on the Xiang-Gui Line, the only incomplete part of the Yong-Long section is the bridges. If the bridge project is completed, the train should be running soon. As for the railway tracks, sleepers, and various metal materials for the entire line, there are more than enough to use. They are also being replenished from Vietnam, so there is no fear of a shortage. Although various sections are occasionally attacked by Japanese aircraft, the destructive power is very limited. Guangxi Province has lush mountains and forests, and there is heavy fog in the morning and evening, making aerial attacks less effective than on the coastal plains.

### Reasons for Middle-Aged Husband's Indifference to Marital Life

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Men play a very important role in reproduction, and there are several reasons for this. One is their economic relationship, and the other is their physical strength. Generally, young men tend to be romantic before marriage, or even if they are cautious and chaste, they inevitably indulge too much after marriage, which may lead to a shorter lifespan. A man's spirit is inevitably greatly affected after each sexual encounter, because our semen is the cornerstone of a man's health. Many young men often do not know to strictly adhere to the methods of preserving their health after marriage, and they inevitably indulge in excessive pleasure, leading to premature aging in middle age. The physiology of women is the opposite of men. Their youthful emotions often increase in middle age (30s). Therefore, discord between middle-aged couples is often based on these reasons. To avoid these reasons, one must abide by the principles of health preservation in order to achieve the desired goal. Therefore, for the future happiness of young people, we must point them in the right direction and provide remedies after the fact.

In principle, a person's energy should not begin to decline reproductively until after the age of sixty. Therefore, the reason for a middle-aged man's indifference to marital life is actually due to licentiousness in his youth, such as masturbation, early marriage, indulgence, and infection with poisonous substances, all of which are factors that lead to coldness in future marital life!

On the other hand, as mentioned in the previous section, women may feel more interested in marital life in middle age due to physiological reasons, which makes it even more frustrating for the husband to maintain his affection. At this time, for the husband's happiness, it is better to quickly increase his energy and rejuvenate his reproductive function in order to eliminate the suffering of kidney deficiency, impotence, premature aging, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. These diseases are the main symptoms that cause coldness in marital life.

Based on my years of experience in treating the above-mentioned symptoms, it is difficult to cure them with ordinary methods. Only by taking the "Corpolin" male preparation made from the essence of strong German animal testicles can one begin to rejuvenate. According to the statistics of my clinical experiments, those cured with "Corpolin" not only see rapid results, but also do not suffer from relapse after a long period of time. Its lasting and reliable efficacy is the best of all endocrine agents. Therefore, I dare to recommend it to patients. The female "Corpolin" has the effect of regulating sperm and seeds.

### Seminal Emission Caused by Weakness and Its Treatment

— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

Although seminal emission is said to be caused by masturbation, it is sometimes caused by physical weakness. People with congenital deficiencies and acquired imbalances, even if they do not masturbate, may also suffer from frequent seminal emission. Therefore, in terms of pharmaceutical treatment, general neurasthenia therapies can be used. Moreover, seminal emission is followed by feelings of neurasthenia, fatigue, headache, insomnia, poor appetite, and pale complexion. It is appropriate to actively administer "Corpolin" male preparation, a testicular essence preparation that replenishes the brain, blood, and kidneys, to add new energy and promote metabolism, to achieve the purpose of prosperity of the limbs and the whole body. Therefore, when patients try other therapies without success, they feel that all symptoms disappear, their minds are clear, and their spirits are refreshed after taking "Corpolin." At the same time, they should also take "Nairis Seminal Emission Pills" to strengthen the essence gate and stop seminal emission and spermatorrhea. The effect is even faster when both drugs are taken together. However, the matter of health preservation cannot be ignored. To cure seminal emission, one must first abstain from masturbation and avoid stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. Otherwise, suffering from seminal emission without preserving one's health, or mistakenly taking other inferior drugs, is equivalent to suicide!

Modern Medicine

### Which is Superior: Oral or Injectable Medication for Leukorrhea?

— Huang Zhongchang, Medical Doctor from the United States

All therapies for gonorrhea have improved due to the development of science. However, to be honest, there are also superior and inferior methods, and progress cannot be made in parallel. This is undeniable. In recent examples, if surgery is required, it can be treated without surgery. Originally, injections were needed, but now oral medications can replace them in many places. For example, if a gonorrhea patient has a weak heart or is afraid of injections, we often have a psychological fear of injections, which can cause sudden fainting. There are many such cases. Therefore, advanced medical countries strive to improve and refine oral medications for gonorrhea in order to replace injections. Currently, the most common injection is chromo therapy, but its efficacy varies. Many poorly manufactured chromo therapy injections often turn yellow-brown after injection, which is not elegant. This is due to the impurity of the injection and also gives patients a bad impression. I have been studying medicine in the United States for six or seven years, and I am very interested in the treatment of gonorrhea. I have long thought about how to avoid injections and replace them with oral medications in certain situations. Later, Dr. Peter from Germany invented the gonorrhea drug "Clinon," which met our expectations. All cases of new and old leukorrhea can produce an anti-gonorrhea and bactericidal effect after taking "Clinon." Its bactericidal scope is not limited to the local area but diffuses to all areas where gonorrhea traces are found. It can be called a unique oral medication in gonorrhea drugs, superior to injectable medications in many ways. In general medical opinion, difficult-to-treat gonorrhea-related prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, anterior and posterior urethritis, and gonorrhea-related leukorrhea in women can be completely cured with "Clinon" with a twelve-point guarantee. Men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Carr-Snowland Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. Follow the instructions and diagrams to treat themselves at home for greater effectiveness. (Note: "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is sold in both Zhongxi Taihe Drugstores)

### New Treatment for Old Leukorrhea

The new treatment for old gonorrhea; my words seem to offer an optimistic atmosphere to gonorrhea sufferers, but that's not the case. Because gonorrhea, no matter how stubborn, can still be treated with methods. The reason is that with the progress of modern science, all kinds of medicine are also changing with each passing day. This old leukorrhea, which has always been regarded as terrible, now also has a special new treatment to completely cure it. Because the root of the old disease is deep, if German anti-gonorrhea serum, electrostatic therapy, and the gonorrhea drug "Clinon" are administered orally, then the so-called difficult-to-treat leukorrhea will be easily solved. However, one important event must also be noted. That is, men who are already married must also be treated at the same time in order to avoid recurrent relapses.

Recently, the number of gonorrhea patients has been increasing day by day, and there are also more and more cases of old gonorrhea. I also encounter them frequently in my clinical practice, but the reason why most of them cannot be cured is that they do not pay attention to the treatment of both husband and wife. There was a Mr. Sima Runjun in Zhejiang Road who had gonorrhea for nearly seven years. Although he had been cured many times, the disease was not completely eradicated. Later, he purchased my book "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" from the Datong Bookstore and requested my treatment. I saw that his testicles were painful, and the right testicle had become hardened, losing its ability to produce sperm. After working, his urine was very turbid, which was chronic orchitis. I used German anti-gonorrhea serum and electrostatic therapy to stimulate the stiff and paralyzed cells, and at the same time, I administered "Clinon" orally to eliminate deep gonorrhea bacteria and promote diuresis and anti-inflammation. After three weeks, the disease began to improve. He returned for treatment, and I treated him with the same methods. He was completely cured after a total of four, five, or six weeks. However, his wife also had gonorrhea-related leukorrhea, so I instructed her to take "Clinon" orally at home and use "Carr-Snowland Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. As a result, she was also completely cured. The couple has lived together for several years without any pathological changes. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty appointments will be given out every day, with each appointment costing only five jiao.

### Lung Disease Should be Treated at Home

— Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician

Lung disease is different from other acute diseases, so its treatment is also different. Lung disease cannot be completely cured in one or two weeks. Therefore, it is very effective to treat it at home. Originally, lung disease therapy is popular in Europe in recent years using lung relaxation therapy. According to German medical reports, the "Pulmonal" oral preparation has been used, and its theory is based on this. After taking it, its special efficacy can make the diseased lung side relax, shrink cavities, so the bacilli lose their activity range and die one after another. Therefore, no matter what stage of lung disease, after taking "Pulmonal," appetite increases sharply, sputum becomes thin and loose, breathing becomes smooth, hemoptysis stops, and cough, fever, night sweats, and chest pain can all disappear day by day, permanently achieving a complete cure. There are no adverse side effects, so its effect is the best of all lung disease drugs.

### British Merchant Ship "Tonghe" Carrying Grain Illegally Detained by Japanese Warship; Firing on Sandboats Kills and Injures Three; Jardine Matheson Asks British Consulate for Diplomatic Intervention; British Warship Sails to Huangpu to Protect

The Xin Feng Rice Shop in this city purchased 25,000 bags of rice in Huangpu. 20,000 bags had already been shipped to Shantou, and the remaining 5,000 bags were suddenly detained by the Japanese, resulting in one crew member killed and four injured. The rice was being transported by the British merchant ship "Tonghe" of Jardine Matheson & Co. The company's manager has requested the British Consulate to negotiate with the Japanese, and a British warship has been dispatched to provide protection. The details are as follows, according to a report by a modern news agency reporter:

Japanese Detain Rice Ship Bound for Shantou

Regarding the re-export of national rice, after the Shanghai Concession authorities strictly restricted it to maintain civilian food supplies, merchants from both the North and South Oceans entrusted several rice shops in this port to directly purchase rice from various producing areas along the river. Since the end of November last year, over the past few months, 300,000 to 400,000 bags have been shipped to Shantou, Fujian, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. The Xin Feng Rice Shop in this city (formerly located on Caishi Street in the Nanshi district) purchased 25,000 bags of rice in Changshu on behalf of merchants from Shantou. The shop entrusted Jardine Matheson Steam Navigation Company to handle the loading and unloading of rice at the Huangpu port. The company dispatched ships such as "Tonghe" and "Ruihe" to transport the rice directly from Huangpu port to Shantou. The first two batches of national rice, totaling 20,000 bags, were shipped in late January and early February of this year. The remaining 5,000 bags had just been transported from the interior to Huangpu on the 10th of this month and were transferred to seven large sandboats to be transported outside the port, preparing to unload onto Jardine Matheson's "Tonghe" ship anchored in the port when they were suddenly detained by the Japanese warship and have not been released.

Japanese Warship Opens Fire, Crew Members Killed and Injured

When the Japanese detained the rice boats, one sandboat (Yang Hua Zi), fully loaded with rice, sailed out of the port beach, reaching the river surface five or six li from the shore. The Japanese warship ordered it to sail to the warship for inspection. Because the warship was anchored more than ten li from the port, the sandboat had strong winds and rapid currents, causing the mast and sails to turn around. The Japanese warship suspected it was trying to escape and opened fire on the sandboat without asking any questions. One crew member was killed instantly in the cabin, and two others were seriously injured and in critical condition.

Reporting to the Consulate to Request Diplomatic Intervention According to reports from the modern news agency, after the "Tonghe" ship and the rice barges carrying the rice were suddenly detained by the Japanese warship, the Xin Feng Rice Shop contacted Jardine Matheson, and sent official Qu Xiu Feng to Huangpu to investigate the truth. At the same time, the owner of the detained "Tonghe" ship also telegraphed Shanghai to report the detention. The company authorities have now compiled the details of the rice shipment to Shantou and the detention, reported to the British Consulate, and requested the Japanese to release the ships immediately. It is now known that the Japanese are using the excuse that the rice was purchased by rice merchants from Shanghai, Shantou, etc., on behalf of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, and they need to investigate the truth before taking action. Therefore, it has not been resolved yet.

British Warship Sails to Huangpu for Protection

Since Jardine Matheson's "Tonghe" ship was detained by the Japanese under various pretexts, it has been many days. In addition to lodging a protest with the Japanese, the British Consulate in Shanghai dispatched a British warship stationed in Shanghai to sail to Huangpu port on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 12th) to protect the merchant ship and anchor near the detained British merchant ship to provide protection.

### Evacuation of Foreigners from Kuling; British, American, and Japanese Reach Agreement

British warship commander and American Consul climb mountain to rescue; However, this matter has not yet been approved by the Chinese side

Regarding the evacuation of foreigners from Kuling, it is reported that the British, American, and Japanese authorities have reached a temporary agreement to have the commander of the British warship "Gnat" and the American Deputy Consul in Hankou go to Kuling on February 17 to rescue the foreigners on the mountain. It is expected that they will arrive in Jiujiang on the 19th. However, this matter has not yet been agreed upon by the Chinese side.

### Temporary Approval for Transporting Local Goods to Shanghai; Must Have Solid Proof; Must Guarantee No Assistance to Japan; Customs in Zhejiang and Fujian Ordered to Inspect and Release; Chamber of Commerce Requests Further Relaxation of Restrictions on Tung Oil and Leather

After the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a ban on the transportation of 54 kinds of local goods, including tung oil, to Shanghai, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and others telegraphed requesting changes. The Ministry has now reviewed the methods for transporting goods to Shanghai and temporarily approved the transportation of bamboo, wood, paper, eggs, charcoal, cotton, tea, etc., with proof from the Chamber of Commerce, which is to be submitted to the Customs for release. Customs in Zhejiang and Fujian have been ordered to comply. The details are as follows:

Properly Drafted Examination Method for Transporting Goods to Shanghai

The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance have temporarily approved the transportation of local goods such as bamboo, wood, paper, eggs, charcoal, cotton, and domestically sold tea to the Shanghai Concession area, provided that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the chamber of commerce and trade associations at the place of origin separately issue certificates guaranteeing that the goods will not be used to assist Japan. The merchant transporting the goods must submit the certificate to the Customs for verification and release. Tung oil, leather, and 13 other items under government control, as well as miscellaneous grains prohibited from export or re-export to the occupied areas, are still prohibited from being transported to Shanghai.

Ministry Approves Transportation of Raw Cotton to Shanghai via Telegram

The Chinese Cotton Mill Association telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting approval to issue certificates for purchasing raw cotton. Yesterday, the Ministry replied via telegram, stating, "Telegram received. Cotton from Ningbo may be transported to the Shanghai Concession area. Before the examination method for prohibited goods to assist the enemy being transported to Shanghai is approved, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the association, or the chamber of commerce and trade associations at the place of origin may separately issue certificates guaranteeing that the goods will not be used to assist the enemy. The merchant transporting the goods must submit the certificate to the Customs for verification and release in accordance with the instructions." This has been forwarded for your information. Ministry of Economic Affairs, Zhen.

Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Relaxation of Restrictions on Tung Oil and Leather

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce replied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs via telegram, requesting that the restrictions on tung oil and leather be relaxed accordingly. "Ministry of Economic Affairs, Chongqing. Telegram received. Many leather factories have moved to the Concession to resume work, requiring raw hides. Tung oil is needed for coating equipment and is also widely used for domestic sales. We request that restrictions be relaxed accordingly. Regarding the certificate issue, we plan to invite relevant associations to make overall plans and then consolidate them through our chamber of commerce. We will discuss this and then submit it." Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully.

Trade Commission Buys as Much as Possible

The Fuhua Company under the Trade Commission, as well as the entrusted Central Trust Bureau, China Vegetable Oil Company, China Tea Company, and others, are buying as much tung oil, tea, raw silk, leather, minerals, medicinal materials, wool, ramie, casings, duck feathers, and other major local goods as possible in major producing areas across the country, concentrating them in Hong Kong and Kunming for export. Local goods from eastern Zhejiang are all loaded onto British merchant ships of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson and transported to Hong Kong for re-export. Taikoo's "Nanchang," "Chengdu," "Niuzhuang," "Liangzhou," "Nanning," and "Yingzhou," and Jardine Matheson's "Zaosheng" and "Hengsheng" are designated to sail between Zhejiang and Hong Kong.

### Financial Market; Stable as Ever

All Industries Pass Through Without Problems

The end of the 27th year of the Republic of China is approaching. Various industries are starting to close their markets to handle accounting. The banking and money industries are extending office hours internally, and the exchange is busy. They will take a four-day holiday starting on the 19th to sort everything out. The Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Farmers Bank have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to adjust the finances during the final period. They should do as much as possible with the mortgage of goods in various industries and the re-mortgage of various banks, so that Shanghai's finances on the isolated island are stable. All industries can pass through the Lunar New Year. Since the four banks made the adjustments, the Shanghai financial market is currently stable. All industries are stable and there are no worries. The slight change in various interest rates in the market is enough to prove the stability of the financial market. Credit loans from money shops after the war can be recovered as scheduled due to the abnormal development of various industries in the concession, which is very different from the total conclusion period in the 26th year.

### Bank Passbooks Are Certificates of Rights; If Lost, Can Be Handled According to Bank Practices; Apply the Civil Procedure Law and Publicly Request the Cancellation Procedure

Since the outbreak of the war, many bank depositors have moved and become displaced, and many have lost their passbooks and deposit slips, making it difficult to handle loss reports. The Shanghai First Special District Court and the Hankou District Court have different opinions on the application for public notice and judgment regarding deposit slips and passbooks. The joint office of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Farmers Bank urgently requested the Ministry of Finance to submit a report to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. The original text is recorded as follows:

Original Report from the Ministry of Finance: "The joint office of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Farmers Bank’s letter No. 1350, dated August 31, 27th year of the Republic of China, states, "The Bank of Communications’ letter No. Gangji Tezi states, "When various deposit slips and passbooks issued by the bank are lost, according to bank practice, the depositor should write an application stating the reasons, report the loss to stop payment, and publish a statement of cancellation in two well-known newspapers agreed upon by the bank. At the same time, they should invite a reliable guarantor to fill out a guarantee letter. After a considerable period of time, if there are no disputes, new documents will be reissued. The above method is convenient in normal times. Since the outbreak of the war, depositors have moved frequently, and the number of lost deposit slips and passbooks has increased. It is difficult for depositors who are displaced in other places to find guarantors, and banks are worried about the lack of procedures. Especially for depositors who have withdrawn from the bank, there is no suitable way to publish in which newspaper. Therefore, some banks have asked depositors to go through the public notice and cancellation procedure to seek legal relief. However, local courts have different opinions on the application for public notice for lost deposit slips and passbooks. Some believe that it is in accordance with Articles 553 and 554, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law and approve it in accordance with Article 536 of the same law. Others believe that deposit slips and passbooks are only ordinary certificates of rights, which are different from securities whose rights exist on the certificate, and there is no provision for public notice. Therefore, they have ruled to reject it. The courts' approval or rejection is based on their legal views, but the depositors are subject to different judgments, and the banks are in a dilemma. Is this type of deposit slip and passbook the same as the meaning of bearer securities mentioned in Article 719 of the Civil Code? Does the 'securities other than the preceding paragraph' mentioned in Article 554, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law include deposit slips and passbooks? If the loss of a deposit slip is not subject to the public notice procedure, is there any other legal remedy? This matter involves legal ambiguities. We are attaching a copy of the rulings on the application for public notice for deposit slips and passbooks by the Hubei Hankou District Court and the Shanghai First Special District Court. Please forward this to the Ministry of Finance for consultation with the Judicial Yuan for a clear interpretation for compliance.' Accordingly, we are attaching the original attachments for your information and referral, and please reply." The attached copy has been sent to the Ministry. This matter involves legal ambiguities. We hereby submit the original attachments and request your examination and approval, and forward it to the Judicial Yuan for a prompt and clear interpretation so that we can forward it to the Ministry for a reply. We would be grateful for your assistance. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan."

Executive Yuan Instruction: Executive Yuan Instruction No. 9597 to the Ministry of Finance states, "Regarding the Ministry's request to forward an interpretation of whether bank deposit slips and passbooks are securities and subject to the public notice procedure, the Judicial Yuan has been consulted and an order has been issued for notification. Now, we approve the Judicial Yuan's consultation No. 1815, dated November 17, 27th year of the Republic of China, stating, "The Legal Interpretation Unification Conference of our Yuan has resolved that various deposit slips and passbooks issued by banks to depositors are a type of certificate of rights, which are different from securities that cannot be separated from rights. The public notice procedure for declaring securities invalid under the Civil Procedure Law does not apply. If lost, there is no other legal basis other than seeking relief in accordance with bank practice." It is hereby ordered that you be notified. This order."

### Japanese Warship No. 4 Parked in Eastern Zhejiang Abuses Inspection of Foreign Ships

"Xin'an Na" and four other ships were successively detained for investigation; Fishermen and merchants in Dinghai petitioned to hire ships to load fish, which was rejected; All ships will suspend sailing for the New Year, and the Shanghai-Taiwan route will be completely suspended

According to modern news agency reporters who inquired in the shipping industry, the No. 4 Japanese warship parked in the sea off Dinghai, eastern Zhejiang, has been abusing inspections of foreign ships sailing to Taizhou for days. The "Xin'an Na," "Hana," "Shan Tai," "Gorden," and other ships have all been illegally searched. Fishermen and merchants in Dinghai petitioned to hire ships to sail to Dinghai to load fresh fish, but it has been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Command to be rejected. At the beginning of the lunar year, most ships will temporarily suspend sailing. The details are as follows:

Five Foreign Ships All Searched

According to modern news agency reporters who inquired in the shipping industry, a No. 4 Japanese warship parked in the sea off Dinghai, eastern Zhejiang, has recently been abusing inspections of foreign ships sailing to Taiwan. If copper, iron, or other raw materials that can be used for military purposes are found on the ship, they will be detained immediately. Foreign ships that have been searched one after another include the German merchant ship "Hana" of the Far East Company, the American merchant ship "Xin'an Na" of the Willingham Company, the Portuguese merchant ship "Shan Tai" of the Zhengde Company, the German merchant ship "Gorden" of the Ruling Foreign Company, and the Italian merchant ship "Ma Gali" of the Sino-Italian Company. They also frequently fire shots at Dinghai, Putuo, and fishing boats, causing disturbances. The foreign merchants are extremely angry about the illegal search behavior of the Japanese warship. It is said that they will ask their respective consulates to lodge protests.

Petition to Hire Ships to Sail to Load Fish Rejected

Since the Dinghai route was banned by the Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities, although the shipping companies have repeatedly requested it, it has not been approved for resumption. Traffic between Dinghai and this city has been completely cut off. However, there is still a Libao ship sailing between Ningbo and Dinghai. Merchants and fishermen in Dinghai have recently complained that fish are piling up there and cannot be transported to Shanghai. Therefore, they sent representatives to Ningbo to petition the Garrison Command, requesting to hire the "Hana," "Shan Tai," and "Gorden" ships to sail to Dinghai specifically to load fresh fish to Shanghai. According to news from the shipping industry, the fishermen and merchants' request has been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Command to be rejected. The fish stranded in Dinghai can be loaded onto the Libao ship and then transferred to Shanghai. It is not allowed to hire other ships to load cargo in order to emphasize the prohibition.

All Ships Suspend Sailing for the New Year. Foreign ships sailing on the Shanghai-Taiwan route include "Shan Tai," "Hana," "Haifu," "Gorden," and "Tang Bei." It is now known that, in addition to "Hana" and "Haifu," which have already entered the Ruirong Shipyard for annual repairs, the remaining "Shan Tai," "Tang Bei," and "Gorden" will all temporarily suspend sailing at the beginning of the lunar year to allow Chinese crew members to spend the Spring Festival. Therefore, the Shanghai-Taiwan route will be completely suspended from the 18th to the 22nd. The Shanghai-Wenzhou line ships "Tanglu," "Meida," "Baoli," "Feikang," and "Hailong" will also temporarily suspend sailing. On the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the Sino-Italian Company's "Deping" ship will continue to sail as usual. The American merchant ship "Xin'an Na" of Weili Hui will also sail to Ningbo today. The Moufu ship of Lihua Foreign Company was originally scheduled to enter the dock for annual repairs on the next shift, but if the local products滞留在甬 can be exported and transported to Shanghai, it has been decided to temporarily stop repairs and continue sailing in order to maintain cargo transportation and benefit transportation.

### Ministry of Finance Trade Commission Announces Methods for Reducing the Settlement of Export Foreign Exchange

If the foreign exchange already settled by the exporter is insufficient, the formalities for reducing the settlement of foreign exchange may be handled according to law

After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance made great efforts to adjust international trade, China's foreign trade has improved, the overall trade deficit has decreased, and exports of major local products have increased. Now, considering that the foreign exchange earned by exporters after selling goods is sometimes less than the amount of foreign exchange settled with the bank, creating practical difficulties. In order to take care of the facts, sympathize with business difficulties, and facilitate compliance by all parties, the "Ten Articles of the Method for Merchants to Reduce the Settlement of Export Foreign Exchange" has been specially formulated. The original text of the method is transcribed as follows: Merchants may apply for a reduced amount of the amount to be settled under the original foreign exchange sold to the bank for settlement. The reduced amount should be calculated using the ratio of 90% of the sales price in foreign exchange as it relates to the amount recorded on the “Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate.” The steps to reduce the settled amount are specified under these provisions. The following conditions are needed for an exporter who has sold foreign exchange for export goods to apply for handling procedures for reducing the settlement of foreign exchange to the Hong Kong Office of this Council before finding a buyer and not yet formally closing a deal. 1. The Hong Kong market price at the time of sale is definitely lower than the estimated price standard used at the time of sale settlement. 2. The quantity of goods at the time of sale is definitely less than the time of settlement due to loss or accidental loss. 3. The quality of goods at the time of sale is definitely worse than the time of sale settlement due to changes. With respect to the goods outlined in these statements, the Hong Kong Office of this Council should handle the following matters: 1. For the circumstances in the first paragraph of the article, it should first check with the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate." If it is true, it should be introduced to the Fuhua Company immediately. If the company does not want to buy it, the merchant will still sell it to the buyer he has found in advance. 2. For the circumstances in the second paragraph of the article, it should check the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" and various relevant documents, and send personnel to check the goods in detail when necessary. 3. For the circumstances in the third paragraph of the article, it should check the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" and various relevant documents, and verify the reported selling price of the deteriorated goods. It should also send personnel to check the goods in detail when necessary. If the Fuhua Company is willing to buy the reported selling price of the deteriorated goods, it should be introduced to the Fuhua Company for purchase. After the Hong Kong Office of this Council has completed the handling of the above procedures, the merchant may sell his goods, obtain a transaction document, and send it to the office for verification and issuance of a "Merchant Certificate for Reducing the Settlement of Export Foreign Exchange." After receiving the above documents, the Hong Kong Office of this Council should fill out and issue the "Merchant Certificate for Reducing the Settlement of Export Foreign Exchange" after verifying that it is true. However, the certificate must not be issued under any circumstances unless the procedures in Article 3 have been followed. After filling out and issuing the above certificate, the Hong Kong Office of this Council should extract and save copies of various documents submitted by the merchant. The original documents should be stamped with the seal "Approved for Reducing the Settlement of Foreign Exchange" and issued to the merchant at any time. However, if there are no copies of the documents and the originals cannot be extracted, the office should copy a summary. After receiving the above certificate, the merchant should take it to the bank to sell the foreign exchange he obtained within two days from the date of issuance. The above restriction will be postponed if there is a bank holiday. After purchasing foreign exchange with the above certificate for reducing the settlement of foreign exchange, the bank must indicate the number of the certificate on the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Report" for verification by this Council. After filling out and issuing the above certificate, the Hong Kong Office of this Council should fill out a "Report on Issuing the Merchant Certificate for Reducing the Settlement of Export Foreign Exchange" in detail and send it to this Council for reference together with a copy of the certificate and various documents. This method will be implemented from the date of announcement.

### Names Listed in the Peace Telegram Were All Forged Under the Direction of a Certain Party; Jiang Tianduo and Others Were Unaware; Have All Issued Statements Denying It

Last month, foreign newspapers in Shanghai and Hong Kong revealed that Jiang Tianduo and others sent a telegram from Shanghai to Wu Peifu, asking him to come out and preside over the peace movement. Most of the names listed in the telegram were well-known figures in society, including Luo Jiaheng and Yi Jiaobo. A few days ago, someone happened to meet Mr. Luo and Mr. Yi at a friend's banquet and asked them about this matter. The two gentlemen were stunned and then said, "Although we saw an article in the Chinese newspapers in Shanghai last month about Jiang Tianduo and others sending a telegram to Yu Lao advocating peace, it was only a few words and we didn't understand it. We didn't know that our names were also listed. You should know that those who are enthusiastic about the peace movement are nothing more than trying to use this as a stepping stone to obtain high-ranking officials and generous salaries. However, we are detached and self-disciplined people and will never be listed in this type of telegram. You can ask around in all directions and you will know that this statement is true." According to the son of Mr. Jiang Tianduo, "My father left Shanghai on November 22 and has not returned yet. It is clear that he did not lead the names to send a telegram to Wu Gong from Shanghai. Moreover, my father has no intention of engaging in any political activities in the midst of this turbulent situation. The pseudo-organization in Nanjing previously summoned my father to the position of 'Minister of the Interior', and later wanted to give my father the position of 'President of the Judicial Yuan', but my father declined both positions. Finally, Wen Zongyao hired my father as a 'consultant' with a monthly salary of 1,000 yuan, but my father also declined on the grounds that it was inappropriate. If my father wanted to engage in the peace movement to hunt for official positions, why would he repeatedly decline high positions?" Later, a certain gentleman said, "If Mr. Luo and Mr. Yi were obsessed with the official positions of a certain party, it would be like Mr. Jiang, and there would be no need to use the peace movement as a stepping stone today. As far as I know, the pseudo-organization in Nanjing wanted to make Mr. Luo the 'Deputy Minister of the Interior' to act on behalf of the ministry, but Mr. Luo firmly refused. Not only Mr. Luo, but Mr. Yi has also repeatedly rejected high positions from the two pseudo-organizations. If the two gentlemen hold themselves in such a way, how can they be listed in the peace movement to humiliate themselves?" However, according to detailed investigations from various sources, the telegram was actually forged by someone who was following the instructions of a certain party. Most of the names listed in the telegram were not agreed to by the individuals themselves. From this, it can be seen that a certain party's military situation has fallen into a dead end.

### Shanghai West Gambling and Opium Paid Protection Money; Still Received by the Japanese; A Person Named Sasaki Is Responsible for Receiving the Money; Japanese Newspaper肆意 Continues to Attack the Shanghai Municipal Council

The Dalu Bao reported that the Shanghai Entertainment Management Bureau on Yuyuan Road operated as usual yesterday (the 14th) and was still headed by a person who claimed to be an agent of the Japanese Army Special Service Department. This is contrary to the official denial by the Japanese side. A reporter went to No. 9, Lane 170, Yuyuan Road, the headquarters of the agency. The person he met was not the certain Japanese person mentioned in yesterday's newspaper. According to him, his name was Sasaki. Until yesterday evening, Sasaki was still waiting for the operators of opium dens and gambling dens outside the boundary to pay. He secretly admitted to the reporter that he knew a certain chief of the Special Service Department in the Western District and said that he did not value the person's weak policies. The reporter reported the situation at the Japanese reception for reporters last night. The spokesman replied, "We will record what you said in shorthand." Yesterday, the Japanese-language Dalu Xinbao wrote an article criticizing the activities of the police department in suppressing terrorists. According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council, the police department arrested 144 criminals in the first eight days of this month, none of whom were handed over to the Japanese authorities. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs should condemn the Shanghai Municipal Council for "violating faithfulness." According to a police officer yesterday, the Japanese claim that the Shanghai Municipal Council should hand over criminals arrested in the Public Concession to the Japanese authorities is not worth considering.

### 法租界西區　有沉重槍聲　　步槍興手槍聲俱有　至夜半且反趨密集　　
Heavy Gunfire in the French Concession's Western District: Both Rifle and Pistol Fire Heard, Intensifying Towards Midnight

大陸報云、昨（十四日）晚法租界西區界外曾聞沉重之槍斃、似來自南市、但未能證實、的於晚間十一時三十分開始、步槍與手槍聲俱有、至夜半一時、仍未停止、且反趨密集、據聞此槍聲之外人估計、每分鐘的及十五響、
According to the Continental Daily News, heavy gunfire was heard last night (the 14th) outside the boundary of the western district of the French Concession, seemingly originating from the Nanshi (Chinese city) area, but this could not be confirmed. It began at 11:30 PM, with both rifle and pistol fire audible, continuing until 1:00 AM, and even intensifying. Foreigners who heard the gunfire estimated it reached fifteen rounds per minute.

留心假鈔票  陳維斗　　
Beware of Counterfeit Banknotes by Chen Weidou

現在市面上流行着的假鈔票極多，無論是誰，稍不經心，便會被欺收進，平空受到損失。
There are many counterfeit banknotes circulating in the market now. Anyone, if a little careless, can be deceived into accepting them, incurring a loss for no reason.

有時候還要引起爭論，造成糾紛，甚至面紅耳赤的鬧到巡捕房裏去。
Sometimes, this can lead to arguments, disputes, and even heated altercations that end up in the police station.

在吃虧得起的人，收受了一張假鈔票，丟掉了也就算了；若是個吃虧不起的人，尤其是勞工小販等苦同胞們，要是吃進了一張五元或十元的假鈔票，小之忍飢挨餓，大之便要弄出人性命來。
For those who can afford the loss, receiving a counterfeit banknote and discarding it might be acceptable. However, for those who cannot afford the loss, especially hardworking laborers and peddlers, accepting a five- or ten-yuan counterfeit banknote can lead to hunger and hardship, or even cause someone to risk their life.

假鈔票眞是害人不淺，可惡透了。　　
Counterfeit banknotes truly cause great harm and are extremely hateful.

每個人每一天，不論多少，總要用錢，用錢就不免要收進付出，收付時候略一大意，就有拿着假鈔票的危險。
Everyone uses money every day, whether it is a lot or a little. Using money inevitably involves receiving and paying, and even a slight carelessness when receiving or paying can lead to the danger of handling counterfeit banknotes.

但是眞的總是眞的，假的總是假的，祗要隨時留心，遇有疑似之際，又肯虛心向人請敎，眞假鈔票，也不難鑑別出來。
However, what is genuine is always genuine, and what is fake is always fake. As long as you are always attentive and willing to humbly ask others for guidance when encountering something suspicious, it is not difficult to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit banknotes.

查如今通用的法幣及各銀行的紙幣，兌換券等，常見的不下二百餘種之多，因此常見的假鈔票也不下數十種之多。
Currently, there are no fewer than two hundred kinds of commonly used legal tender (法幣) and banknotes, exchange certificates, and so on from various banks. Therefore, there are no fewer than dozens of kinds of commonly seen counterfeit banknotes.

假鈔票的紙張和印刷，有糊裹糊塗，一望而知的；也有十分精細，不易察破的。
Some counterfeit banknotes have paper and printing that are sloppy and easily recognizable at a glance, while others are very detailed and difficult to detect.

更有用眞鈔塗改的，或是拿失效的鈔票混充的，花色實在很多，不妨分開來談談：　　
There are also those that are altered from genuine banknotes or those that are mixed in using expired banknotes. There are truly many types, so let's discuss them separately:

翻印的——所有的假鈔票中，自以翻印的爲最多。
Reproduced banknotes - Among all counterfeit banknotes, reproduced ones are the most common.

如中，中，交，農，中南，通商，四明，及中國實業等銀行的各類新舊鈔票，不時會有假的發現。
For example, various new and old banknotes from banks such as Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Central South Bank, Commercial Bank, Ningpo Commercial Bank, and China Industrial Bank are occasionally found to be counterfeit.

若要分別細說，短短數十行决寫不了。
If we were to explain them in detail, it would not be possible to cover them in just a few dozen lines.

總說一句：此類翻印僞鈔，大都紙張較劣，印刷，色澤，簽字，印鑑等都較差，祇要仔細辯認，便能察破。
In general, these reproduced counterfeit banknotes mostly have inferior paper, and the printing, colors, signatures, and seals are all of poorer quality. As long as you carefully examine them, you can detect them.

大凡假鈔票，比較容易看穿的地方，就是圖畫和花紋。
Generally, the easiest places to spot on a counterfeit banknote are the images and patterns.

眞的必定明晰異常，假的必有一二個模糊之點，或是花紋不精細分明，或是人物的面目不淸，樹木的枝葉不分。
Genuine ones are always exceptionally clear, while fake ones will have one or two blurry spots, or the patterns are not finely detailed and distinct, or the faces of the people are not clear, or the branches and leaves of the trees are not distinguishable.

例如中國農民銀行德納羅印鈔公司版的綠色五元法幣，假的發現很多，假票的紙張，光澤等都很逼眞，正反面花紋亦細，只有各人面部的銀睛鼻子分不淸，故能立時察出。
For example, the green five-yuan legal tender issued by the Farmers Bank of China and printed by the De La Rue printing company has many counterfeit versions. The paper, luster, etc., of the fake banknotes are very realistic, and the patterns on both the front and back are also detailed. However, the silver eyes and noses on the faces of the people are not clear, so they can be detected immediately.

按這張僞票的號碼，首三位大概都爲DT267因流行已久，害人必多，所以特別在此提出，幸大家格外注意。
According to the serial number of this counterfeit banknote, the first three digits are probably DT267. Because it has been circulating for a long time and will surely harm many people, it is specially mentioned here. Hopefully, everyone will pay extra attention.

角票——現在市上常見的假角票有中央銀行的藍色雙角票，及中國農民銀行與徐州平市官錢局的二角票，江蘇農民銀行和中國農民銀行的五角票，中國銀行的五角票亦有假的，幸尙少見。
Small denomination notes - Commonly seen counterfeit small denomination notes in the market now include the Central Bank's blue two-jiao notes, the Farmers Bank of China and Xuzhou Pingshi Official Bank's two-jiao notes, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank and the Farmers Bank of China's five-jiao notes, and the Bank of China's five-jiao notes, which are also counterfeit, but fortunately less common.

上列數種角票中以中央的雙角及中農的五角僞鈔，印製比較精細。
Among the several types of small denomination notes listed above, the Central Bank's two-jiao and the Farmers Bank of China's five-jiao counterfeit banknotes are printed relatively finely.

奸徒行用之初，往往還在票面用洋燭一擦，算是光彩哩。
At the beginning of their circulation, unscrupulous people often rub them with a wax candle to make them look glossy.

廢票——已廢的鈔票混在眞票中行使，亦是常見的事，如直隸省銀行的鈔票，失效已久，可是近來有人在某路車站找進多張。
Expired Banknotes - It is also common for expired banknotes to be mixed in and used among genuine banknotes, such as the banknotes of the Zhili Provincial Bank, which have been expired for a long time, but recently someone has been given several of them at a station on a certain road.

又如中國銀行民國十六年漢口地名的一元鈔票，顏色與福建地名的一元中國銀行鈔票相似，圖紋亦同，一不留神，也誤認爲眞的可用而收進，就要賠錢了。
Another example is the one-yuan banknote of the Bank of China from Hankou in the 16th year of the Republic of China, which is similar in color and design to the one-yuan banknote of the Bank of China from Fujian. If one is not careful, it can be mistaken for a genuine and usable banknote and accepted, resulting in a loss of money.

半眞半假的——這類鈔票，原本是眞的，因爲改了樣，就只好算是假的了。
Half-Genuine, Half-Fake Banknotes - This type of banknote was originally genuine, but because it has been altered, it can only be considered fake.

像這樣的鈔票普通有三種：一是上下或左右相黏併的而號碼各不相同；二是黏併過的鈔票，在併處缺了一條或一大塊：三是把好好一張鈔票，不情功夫的剖成正反兩個面，附在大宗鈔蔡內去行用，點騐的人倘只看一面，就要上當了。
There are usually three types of such banknotes: one is that the top and bottom or left and right are glued together and the numbers are different; second, the glued banknote is missing a strip or a large piece at the junction; and third, a perfectly good banknote is laboriously split into two sides, the front and back, and attached to a large denomination banknote to be used. If the person verifying it only looks at one side, they will be deceived.

改票——改票種類很多，大概分別起來有兩種。
Altered Banknotes - There are many types of altered banknotes, but they can be roughly divided into two types.

一種是用失效的鈔票改的，如廣東省銀行的一元票改爲中國農民銀行的一元票，紅色的山東省銀行十元鈔票改爲交通銀行的十元票。
One type is altered from expired banknotes, such as changing a one-yuan note from the Guangdong Provincial Bank to a one-yuan note from the Farmers Bank of China, or changing a red ten-yuan banknote from the Shandong Provincial Bank to a ten-yuan note from the Bank of Communications.

一種是以眞鈔票改的，現在已有二張發現，一張是中央銀行華德路公司版綠色伍元眞鈔票，經過精巧的手術，將票面所有數目字，一概改爲拾字，正面中間伍元大字上端的「伍元」兩個小字，改爲兩個「通」字，於是一張伍元眞法幣，一變而爲一張拾元假鈔票。
One type is altered from genuine banknotes. There have already been two discovered, one being a green five-yuan genuine banknote from the Central Bank printed by Waterlow & Sons, which, after delicate surgery, has all the numerals on the banknote altered to "拾" (ten). The two small characters "伍元" (five yuan) above the large "伍元" in the center of the front side have been changed to two characters "通" (circulation). Thus, a five-yuan genuine legal tender banknote has been transformed into a ten-yuan counterfeit banknote.

同樣的，發行不久的中國銀行德納羅印鈔公司伍圓法幣，經過類似的手術，也變成拾圓的僞幣了。　
Similarly, the five-yuan legal tender banknote from the Bank of China printed by De La Rue, which was issued not long ago, has also been transformed into a ten-yuan counterfeit banknote through a similar operation.

總之，假鈔票有如小賊毛，留心時候偏沒有，一不留心就到了。
In short, counterfeit banknotes are like petty thieves, they're never around when you're paying attention, but they appear when you're not careful.

所以看鈔票最要謙虛，切忌自大，儘管是內行，忙中有錯，也有失眼的時候。
Therefore, when examining banknotes, it's most important to be humble and avoid arrogance. Even if you're an expert, mistakes can happen in the rush, and there are times when you can miss something.

若然識票不多而又自以爲是，要逞英雄好漢，那末難免要弄得焦頭爛額，旣賠寃錢再受氣了。
If you don't know much about banknotes but are self-righteous and want to show off your heroism, then you're bound to end up in a mess, losing money and being humiliated.

閔行日軍警備部　遭遊擊隊襲擊　傷斃日軍二十餘人　滬西方面仍對峙中　　
Japanese Garrison in Minhang Attacked by Guerrillas: Over Twenty Japanese Soldiers Wounded and Killed, Confrontation Continues in Western Shanghai

滬西七寶鎭西周早國地方、現由遊擊隊王余山部第二特務大隊薜某佔領爲根據地、前晚奉令與陳英之第一特務隊、暗襲上海縣屬閔行鎭日陸軍警備部、事前由董芹生派女隊員十二名、挾匣子砲喬裝農婦、偷過警戒綫、掩伏日軍隊部之四周、至黑夜中發槍爲號、內外夾攻、日軍大駭、且多畏死、棄槍潰散、遊擊隊遂槍彈如雨、並鄭手溜彈、不旋踵傷斃日軍二十餘人、奪獲步槍十九枝、戰馬七匹、輜重子彈不計、安然仍返泗涇七寶等處根據地、恊同正規軍、與滬西日軍對峙、
The area of Xizhoushaoguo in Qibao Town, western Shanghai, currently occupied by Xue of the Second Special Operations Battalion under the guerrilla Wang Yushan, was ordered the night before last to secretly attack the Japanese Army Garrison in Minhang Town, which belongs to Shanghai County, together with Chen Ying's First Special Operations Team. Prior to the attack, Dong Qinsheng dispatched twelve female team members, carrying box cannons and disguised as peasant women, to secretly cross the警戒 line and lie in ambush around the Japanese army headquarters. They fired guns in the darkness as a signal, attacking from both inside and outside. The Japanese army was greatly alarmed, and many were afraid of death, abandoning their weapons and scattering. The guerrillas then rained bullets and threw grenades, quickly wounding and killing over twenty Japanese soldiers, seizing nineteen rifles, seven war horses, and countless ammunition. They then safely returned to their bases in Sijing, Qibao, and other places, working with the regular army to confront the Japanese army in western Shanghai.

嘉定人兪耀章、原屬土劣之流、戰前曾服務於嘉定公安局偵緝股、自國軍西移之後、兪甘心附偽、竟出任僞組織之嘉定縣警察局局長、魚肉鄉民、氣焰不可一世、去年十一月十二日上午九時、兪因事來滬、在老半齋早餐、即偕妾僱坐人力車、經過浙江路福州路口時、突被預伏路旁之壯士三人、　　
Yu Yaozhang, from Jiading, was originally a local thug. Before the war, he served in the Detective Section of the Jiading Public Security Bureau. After the National Army moved west, Yu willingly collaborated with the puppet regime, becoming the Director of the Jiading County Police Bureau under the puppet organization, oppressing the people and acting arrogantly. At 9:00 AM on November 12th last year, Yu came to Shanghai for business, had breakfast at Lao Ban Zhai, and then hired rickshaws with his concubine. When passing the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Fuzhou Road, they were suddenly attacked by three strong men lying in ambush on the roadside.

開槍射擊　兪當命中一槍、而附近站崗之華捕、聞警趕至、壯士等即開槍抵抗、捕亦還擊、致有壯士河北人李高文腦部擊中一槍而被捕、當抄獲蓮蓬手槍一支、子彈六粒經捕房與兪併送醫院診治、嗣兪因傷重斃命、李因傷尙輕、現已痊愈、由捕房解送特一法院依殺人罪起訴、　　
Firing commenced. Yu was hit by a bullet. Chinese police officers stationed nearby heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. The strong men resisted by firing, and the police returned fire, resulting in Li Gaowen, a strong man from Hebei, being shot in the head and arrested. A lotus pistol and six bullets were confiscated. Both Li and Yu were sent to the hospital for treatment. Yu later died from his injuries. Li's injuries were minor, and he has now recovered. The police sent him to the Special First Court to be prosecuted for murder.

審訊各情　已誌本報、昨晨此案由特院繼續提訊、並由法院指定名律師陳霆銳爲被吿義務辯護人、庭上詰之李高文、供認係奉游擊隊分隊長王某之命、暗殺兪耀章不諱、庭上以事實明瞭、乃論令開始辯論、即由陳律師辯稱、查本案被吿對於槍殺兪耀章一點、　　
Details of the interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the Special Court continued to question [Li Gaowen] in this case, and the court appointed the famous lawyer Chen Tingrui as the defendant's pro bono lawyer. Li Gaowen admitted in court that he assassinated Yu Yaozhang on the orders of Squad Leader Wang of the guerrillas. The court, considering the facts clear, ordered the debate to begin. Lawyer Chen argued, "The defendant in this case has admitted to shooting Yu Yaozhang

直認不諱　故事實毋庸辯論、但普通之暗殺案件、不外爲財色或私仇而起、而本案被吿之殺人動機、旣不爲財、又不爲色、更無私仇可言、則其動機何在、應予研究、今就審理之所得、已足證明死者兪耀章之出仟僞嘉定縣公安局長、毫無疑義、而被吿之供述、因　　
He admits it without reservation, so there is no need to debate the facts. However, ordinary assassination cases arise from money, sex, or personal revenge. The defendant's motive for killing in this case is not for money, sex, or personal revenge. Therefore, what is his motive? This should be investigated. Based on the proceedings, it is sufficient to prove that the deceased Yu Yaozhang served as the puppet Jiading County Public Security Bureau Chief without a doubt. The defendant confessed that because

兪係漢奸　故奉隊長之命除之、則渠之行爲、係奉有命令、且查被吿係一軍人、依照軍律、軍人應以服從爲天職、今渠之行爲、實與普通之暗殺案件不能相提並論、捕房依普通殺人罪起訴、敝律師殊認爲不妥、敝律師以指定辯護人之資格、根據法律上之見解、被吿之行爲、竟是搆成　　
Yu was a traitor, so he was ordered by his captain to eliminate him. Therefore, his actions were carried out under orders. The defendant is a soldier, and according to military law, a soldier's duty is to obey orders. His actions cannot be compared to ordinary assassination cases. The police prosecution for ordinary murder is inappropriate in the opinion of this lawyer. As an appointed defense lawyer, based on my legal understanding, the defendant's actions constitute

義憤殺人　敝見如此、用以供獻庭上參考、是吾有當、應請庭上以自由心證、參酌證據、爲適當之公平裁判云、旋由捕房方面陳述意見後、審判長即宣吿辯論終結、當庭宣吿判决主文、李高文激於義憤而殺人、處有期徒刑二年六個月、如不服本判决、於接到判决書後十天之內、得向高二分院提起上訴、遂退庭、
Killing out of righteous indignation. This is my opinion, submitted for the court's reference. The court should consider the evidence and make an appropriate and fair judgment." Subsequently, after the police stated their views, the presiding judge declared the debate closed and announced the verdict in court: Li Gaowen, who killed out of righteous indignation, is sentenced to two years and six months in prison. If he does not agree with this judgment, he may appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court within ten days of receiving the written judgment. The court was then adjourned.

On the 13th of the month, someone from the Diao Chan Escort Agency in Room 209 of the Far Eastern Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road summoned the agency's female employee, Lin Xiangfei, to dance at the Dahua Dance Hall on Avenue Edward VII. After five hours, the customer who summoned Lin had not paid a single cent. Later, the agency found that the person who summoned Lin was Wu Fugeng, the manager of the Shanghai Dance Hall on Guangdong Road, so they planned to retaliate. At 11:30 PM the night before last, Wu Fugeng, after leaving the Shanghai Dance Hall, was walking back to his residence at No. 6 Dashun Lane on Yu Qiaqing Road with his wife Wu Meili and brother Wu Sanyuan when, to their surprise, more than ten people lying in ambush rushed forward and beat them up. Wu Fugeng was immediately injured in the face. These people, not satisfied, then dragged Wu and his group to Room 209 of the Far Eastern Hotel and continued to beat them. Someone reported this to the Old Gate Police Station, which immediately ordered Chinese Detective Lu Shouchang to rush to the scene and arrest Zhou Bingsheng from Changzhou and Ma Jinbao from Shaoxing. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them for assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Code. Zhou confessed that the dispute arose because Wu did not pay for summoning the escort girl. However, Wu Fugeng denied ever summoning an employee of the agency, saying it must have been a case of mistaken identity. Judge Fang verified the confession and, because the matter still needed to be investigated, postponed the trial of the case.

偽造冒牌香烟　兩犯治罪　　
Two Convicted for Counterfeiting Trademarked Cigarettes

近來一般僞造冒牌香烟、爲期妥當起見、如仿造某種牌子之烟、即收集原牌之烟盒、而將所製之劣質烟捲、裝入原盒、故買主最易受欺、此種仿冒案件、捕房屢有破獲、但以利之所在、此風依然潛滋暗長、日前匯司捕房據報、住居海寗路九七五號之甬人陳炳其、專以冒牌香烟向各烟紙店兜銷、當飭中西探員馳往、將陳逮捕、詰據供認彼係代北江西路二百十五號之蘇州人陳榮慶銷售、因復往將該犯拘押、並搜出烟葉捲烟木機以及各種眞牌空盒等物、昨解第一特區地方法院、由戴推事訊實、判决陳榮慶處徒刑五月、如易科罰金、以三元折抵一日、陳炳其處罰金二百元、如易服勞役、以三元折抵一日、起案物件沒收、
Recently, in order to be thorough in counterfeiting trademarked cigarettes, counterfeiters collect the original brand's cigarette boxes and pack the inferior cigarettes they produce into the original boxes, making it very easy to deceive buyers. The police have cracked down on such counterfeiting cases many times, but because of the profits involved, this trend continues to grow secretly. A few days ago, the Huisi Police Station received a report that Chen Bingqi, a Ningbo native residing at 975 Haining Road, specialized in peddling counterfeit cigarettes to various cigarette paper shops. They immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene and arrest Chen. Under interrogation, Chen confessed that he was selling on behalf of Chen Rongqing, a Suzhou native at 215 North Jiangxi Road. They then went to arrest Chen Rongqing and found tobacco, wooden cigarette rolling machines, and various empty boxes of genuine brands. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Dai interrogated them and sentenced Chen Rongqing to five months in prison. If he opts to pay a fine instead, it will be at a rate of three yuan per day. Chen Bingqi was fined 200 yuan. If he opts to perform labor instead, it will be at a rate of three yuan per day. The items involved in the case were confiscated.

舊曆年關密邇　租界防範增嚴　　
Tightened Security in Concessions as Lunar New Year Approaches

兩租界當局、近以時屆舊曆年關、界內各商業、咸均辦理大結束、收賬人員、携帶鉅款、往來收付、難免爲宵小所覬覦、爲保護商賈安全計、連日特加派中西幹探、加緊戒備、增添巡邏、並於各銀行錢莊大商店之所在地、加派梭巡、若遇行路可疑者、即以施行搜檢、嚴密盤詰、以防萬一、致在兩租界之與華界接壤處所、更加嚴密防範、必要時、並將裝設鐵絲網、予以堵塞、戒備時間、計爲一週、
The authorities of the two concessions, given that the Lunar New Year is approaching and various businesses within the concessions are conducting their year-end closings, with bill collectors carrying large sums of money for collections and payments, which inevitably attracts the attention of petty criminals, have specially dispatched more Chinese and foreign detectives in recent days to strengthen security, increase patrols, and add roving patrols to the locations of various banks, money shops, and large stores, to protect the safety of merchants. If suspicious pedestrians are encountered, they will be searched and strictly questioned to prevent any unforeseen events. As a result, security has been tightened even more at the points where the two concessions border the Chinese areas. If necessary, barbed wire will be installed to block them. The security period is estimated to be one week.

At 12:30 AM on the 14th, the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station received a report from Chinese officer No. 3248 stationed at the intersection of Brenan Road and Rue de Magistris, stating that Chinese officers, including No. 2549, had a conflict with fake police officers from the fake "Great Way Municipal Government" and personnel from the Guangsheng gambling den at No. 135 Brenan Road.

Was surrounded and beaten, and his duty belt was torn off. Upon receiving the report, Chinese Police Chief Yao Jiagui and Western Detective Chief Tielerden led a large number of detectives to rush to the scene for investigation. When the police chiefs arrived, Chinese officer No. 2549 had already been rescued by other Chinese and Indian officers, and Li Pinquan from Nanjing (former Shanghai Public Security Bureau employee), a shareholder of the Guangsheng gambling den who committed the assault, and Wu Xiufeng from Jiangbei (former Shanghai Public Security Bureau detective), a cashier, had been arrested. The incident was caused by dozens of rickshaws parked on Brenan Road on the night of the 14th

along the side of the road within the Concession, which happened to block the main access route to and from the Guangsheng gambling den. At 12:15 AM, a car (No. 8191, owned by Li Pinquan), used by the gambling den to transport customers, attempted to enter the gambling den from outside and collided with a rickshaw. Chinese officer No. 2376, who was stationed nearby, went forward to inquire. Seeing that the rickshaw was not damaged, he only issued

A slight warning and concluded the matter. Unexpectedly, fifteen minutes later, more than ten people suddenly rushed out of the gambling den, led by Li and Wu, and including two fake police officers, crossed outside the entrance of the gambling den and onto the Concession's road, forcibly demanding that the rickshaws be moved and attempting to drag the rickshaw drivers into the gambling den. Chinese officer No. 2594 saw this and went forward to intervene, stating that they should not cross the border to drag people. Unexpectedly, Li and Wu became angry out of embarrassment and, together with the fake police officers, forcibly twisted the officer's arm and

Dragged him inside the gambling den, intending to humiliate him. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the officer immediately took out his pistol and fired a shot into the sky as a warning. Chinese officer No. 2859 and four Indian mounted patrols, who were patrolling nearby, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, but the surrounding of No. 2549 could not be resolved. No. 2859 also fired a shot into the sky as a demonstration, and the crowd finally released him. More Chinese and Western officers arrived and tried their best to

Arrest Li and Wu. They also notified the police station by phone and took the two men back to the police station. Subsequently, Chinese Inspector Liu Yonggui and personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Engineering Department rushed to the scene and investigated, determining that the incident occurred entirely within the Concession area and that the officers' actions had not exceeded their authority.

Random Thoughts: One Cannot Help But Be Dissatisfied 
By Mao Lie

Being slapped in the face and then having to smile is the most unbearable thing in the world. However, being bullied by others, listening to their sweet talk and sophistry, is like the saying, "A slap followed by a caress." Yet, one cannot help but be satisfied; the degree of unbearableness is only fifty steps versus a hundred.

Last year, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, was shot and seriously injured. As a result, apologies and explanations came together, and Britain could not help but be satisfied. The American gunboat USS Panay was bombed and sunk. As a result, apologies and compensation came together, and the United States could not help but be satisfied. These are cases where satisfaction has an excuse, seemingly a somewhat justifiable satisfaction.

Recently, Britain, the United States, and France jointly protested the monopolization of the Far Eastern market. The wording seemed very "strong," but as a result, there was neither apology nor explanation, nor was there any agreement on compensation. Until now, they have been completely ignored. Since Britain, the United States, and France have no general principle to properly handle the aftermath, their position is equivalent to not being able to help but be satisfied. This kind of satisfaction cannot be named, or perhaps it can be named "Ah Q-style satisfaction."

In the past two days, Hainan Island has been invaded, greatly threatening Britain and France, who have made separate protests. As a result, after explanations and assurances, France was the first to express satisfaction, and it seems that Britain cannot help but be satisfied. Because in the past, they have always been unable to help but be satisfied, it seems that Britain cannot be left out this time. Because in the past, they have always been unable to help but be satisfied, now, after ignoring "strong" protests, if they do not sensibly express satisfaction and step down, what can they do?

Therefore, a person with oversensitive nerves might say that even if Annam or Hong Kong were under actual threat, or even simply invaded, under this repeated acquiescence, perhaps they still could not help but be satisfied.

However, smiling after being slapped in the face is extremely painful in the heart; being unable to help but be satisfied with the insolence of others also means the pain in the heart will never fade. We understand this feeling, and we sympathize with them.

Now, we no longer smile after being slapped; the slap is over, the slap has long passed. Then, their dissatisfaction will inevitably be seen in action one day. You punch, I kick—of course, this is what everyone expects. Otherwise, I don't believe that dignified Britain, the United States, and France will succumb to the pressure of emerging forces and become walking corpses under our Republic of China.

Under Martial Law
By Ding Di

Today, the people on the street seem uneasy. Several small vendors didn't set up their stalls. Just now, a notice to reassure the people was posted on the street, but the paste wasn't even dry before someone tore it down, and no police came to intervene.

Where did the police go?

Suddenly, an old woman and a young man got into a scuffle, but there were no police to be found. They fought and wrestled, and the street was crowded with people...

Lord Fang came home from the Pacification Bureau, his mind muddled, like a drunkard.

Guerrillas! … Guerrillas! … Guerrillas! … Countless "Guerrillas!" … These hateful symbols! … One horizontal, one vertical, … one horizontal and one vertical again, … entangling the heart … a vast emptiness, a vast emptiness.

His mouth, burning hot like fire, both burning and painful, both angry and ashamed…

"I want to ask the section chief... would it be alright for the Self-Government Association to suspend operations for a few days... um! Um!... Just a few days..." Damn it! Is that unreasonable? Calling me "a bastard!" Your ancestors are the bastards! Crack! … Thinking of this, his face turned a bit red, and he quickly slapped himself. Ring-a-ling! The rickshaw bell was frantically rung by the master, and with a strange shout, … a child on the road was knocked down! Leaving behind a curse…

The commissioner-lord was thrown from his rickshaw. The lord was already like bread, but today he was even more scorched, hot and lightheaded. Flee? Not flee? But not fleeing means death. Old Lord Wu of C City is a precedent. Flee? How to flee?…

The second concubine greeted him; a handkerchief … a covered teacup … comforting sweets with fine cigarettes … an old routine! Performing the formalities.

The lord was impatient, preemptively reporting the news:

"The news is bad! There aren't many × troops in the city. It is said that the guerrillas are only ten miles away from the south gate. The new sandbar across the river has also been occupied by them..."

"Oh dear! What's to be done! Tonight, is it urgent or not…"

The second concubine was both afraid of death and worried about young master Qin.

She suggested:

"We should ask Fang Gui to visit Third Sister and get some information. Whether the × soldiers will defend the city or not, she will know. As long as the × soldiers are prepared to defend for two or three days, there's no problem."

The lord strongly agreed and immediately sent Fang Gui to the Pacification Bureau.

Fang Gui left. The lord paced back and forth in the hall; he complained to his family:

"It's not that I lack integrity! It's not for people to enjoy happiness; I wouldn't do this lousy job again! … Humph! Humph! Now half my head is not on my body! …"

Waiting and waiting, Fang Gui returned. Stumbling and rolling, his face red and voice trembling … "Is the situation bad?" The lord’s heart skipped a beat. The bread seemed to swell.

"The Pacification Bureau has left, and all the staff have left too!"

Bad, bad! …

"What about Third Concubine?"

"She's gone too!"

A roar in his ears, a blur before his eyes, his whole body like ice meeting fire, melting and burning…

The second concubine advised the lord to go to the association. President Sun, Secretary Wang, Director Zhang, and Commissioner Wu were there; let's see what they can do. Everyone should discuss it at length and not panic!

"That's right!"

The lord was pulled to the Self-Government Association in a rickshaw.

Stepping into the council chamber, it was already full of guests. Old Man Wu was shaking uncontrollably … President’s bald head was flushed red … Secretary Wang and Clerk Ding were holding a planchette.

"Let's ask Lord Guan Yu to show us a way out!"

Everyone thought so, prayed so. But the planchette rested on the sand tray, quietly, always quietly…

"Ah! Lord Guan Yu is not descending to the altar — strange —" Everyone was surprised by this statement from Lord Fang, and rushed to ask, "What do you mean?"

Lord Fang looked around and refused to say. So everyone understood on their own.

A noisy uproar: blaming heaven, blaming others, guilt, regret, fear, trembling, …

Seeing that they had no idea, he became more panicked himself, and he didn't stay any longer. Lord Fang took a rickshaw back to the mansion.

The "family flower" was gone, old rascal.

"The second concubine left with her suitcase," the servants said.

The night passed in desolation and fear. At daybreak, the sound of people surged in the street.

Occasionally, a few voices passed by the street window:

"The ×× army has retreated! There's not a single one in the city!"

"Are you leaving?"

"I'm not leaving. What are the common people afraid of! Those commissioners are in deep trouble!"

"……"

A flag was raised on the flagpole of the Ancestral Temple—red, blue, and white, reflecting the morning sun, especially beautiful and radiant.

A roaring crowd surged, unleashing a mad roar; punishment began—this was a fair, just, and harsh judgment!

"Kill the dogs of the collaborating ×!"

"Catch the traitors! Don't let one escape!"

Catch Fang Wenyi!

"……"

Lord Fang slumped in the desk drawer…

### Not Reading Books
By Geng Zhi

What I am talking about is "not reading books," not "not studying." "Reading" means casually browsing, while "studying" means delving deeply like a student. Only students study a lot and read little. Once they leave student life, most people no longer read, let alone study.

First, let's talk about the educators who are associated with books. I don't know how many of them don't read books, let alone study. These people use textbooks as their professional tools. Outside of textbooks, it's rare to see them pick up other kinds of books. Even if they do, perhaps they are just reading something for entertainment.

However, those who are associated with books, the teachers, are probably inferior to the editors in the publishing houses. As far as I know, many publishing house editors don't read books and certainly don't study. Their situation is similar to many reporters who don't read newspapers. I think, in their minds, they probably think that editing books is their job. With their job secure, why bother with other troublesome things? Just like a shoemaker, it's enough to make shoes, why bother with sewing clothes; it's enough to do it according to the methods taught by the master, why bother to study methods of improvement.

Many people in these two groups don't read books. Even more people in other professional circles don't read books, which has simply become a matter of course. For example, some doctors, the more famous they are, the less they read books, especially new medical books. They say that business is so good that reading books would only delay earning money. Outside of medical books, they might read some books for entertainment, but most of them won't read books that increase knowledge. Furthermore, some shop owners with booming businesses and big merchants who earn a lot of money probably regard books as enemies.

Therefore, we can go to Fuzhou Road and Henan Road to see who exactly are the people who frequent the bookstores. Can we not also say that among people with jobs, they are still a minority? It is no wonder that the publishing industry is underdeveloped and the general level of people's intelligence is low.

I always feel that Europeans and Americans have rich common sense. If you talk to an ordinary person in business or industry, they can generally respond to you with knowledge of ancient and modern times, as well as geography. If you talk to one of our compatriots of the same class, then, in addition to your own loneliness, you can only listen to them say some irrelevant, half-understood, and boring words. I can say that the difference between them is not due to the different education received in schools, but simply the difference between reading books and not reading books after leaving school.

In addition to having a daily newspaper, most middle-class families in Europe and America have one or two magazines and a small library. What about our middle-class families? Many don't even have a daily newspaper, magazines are rarely seen, and libraries are even more out of the question. Their common sense is rich, their knowledge is advanced, while we are the opposite. To put it bluntly, it's really quite ordinary.

Of course, you can say that the standard of living is different, and we really don't have the extra money to buy books and magazines. However, we have money for smoking, drinking, playing mahjong, and even going to entertainment venues. Why is that? As for those who are originally wealthy, what else can be said?

Recently, I heard a piece of news saying that a former ambassador of our country to a certain country was looked down upon by the "brain trust" of that country, who said that he was unlearned and knew nothing about newly published books, even though he spoke the foreign language quite fluently. This is certainly the harsh criticism of the "brain trust," because why must diplomats be "scholars"? However, from this, the fact that our people do not read books is revealed.

However, the kind of reading in which cunning officials under Zhang Zhidong in the past would buy off Zhang Zhidong's attendants in advance, inquire daily about the books Zhang Zhidong was reading, and then quickly read them in order to anticipate Zhang Zhidong's intentions when meeting him, showing off their erudition and winning Zhang Zhidong's favor can only be considered not reading books.

Our not reading books is precisely one of the daily problems whose reasons I don't understand and whose solutions I can't find. Inexplicable, helpless, there are many such things!

### The Flames of War - A Medium-Length Novel
By Zhou Yan

At this moment, he received an order from the division headquarters:

"The enemy is now dividing its forces into two routes, attacking Wangjiangjing and Pingwang. However, their main force has obviously not yet concentrated, and it is not difficult to repel them. But based on past combat experience, after the enemy breaks through any one route, they often quickly concentrate their main force on that route. Therefore, we must resolutely block them, not allow the enemy to pass, and if necessary, launch a full-scale attack to completely annihilate their vanguard."

Regiment Commander Ye immediately issued an order to tell the meaning of this order to the lower-level officers and soldiers. In less than a quarter of an hour, all the officers and soldiers knew that the enemy had divided their already small forces to attack Pingwang. So morale became more enthusiastic, but everyone was still on high alert, and no one dared to be careless.

The artillery was still roaring in a soul-stirring manner. Most of the artillery fire came from the enemy's positions. As for the counterattacks from our artillery positions, they were very sparse. This was in accordance with the order of the military authorities to cherish ammunition, and they would not fire easily unless it was truly effective. At the same time, enemy aircraft were still cooperating with their ground forces, constantly posing an air threat to our army, but our army suffered very little damage.

Under the cover of dense artillery fire, the enemy launched a new attack. Those iron-clad animals—tanks and armored vehicles—crawled slowly on the ground, constantly making terrifying roars.

When those iron-clad animals approached within the range of our army's rifles, immediately, crisp machine-gun and volley fire erupted from our army's front line, interspersed with the booming sound of hand grenades exploding. At the same time, the counterattacks from the artillery positions gradually intensified. Although the enemy, under the cover of mechanized weapons, rushed to the front of our army's positions, when they left those shelters to charge, they were swept back by our army's dense machine-gun fire.

In this way, two hours passed in smoke and bullets. The sky gradually darkened, and the enemy still failed to break through any corner of our national defense line. Their momentum gradually weakened.

At this time, Regiment Commander Ye drew out his command saber.

"Charge!" he shouted firmly and tragically. Although his shout was drowned out by the deafening gunfire, his shout was still very loud.

"Woo-doo-doo—Dee dah! Dah dah dee! ..." The bugle call to charge sounded again heroically. The soldiers put bayonets on their rifles, jumped out of the trenches, and looked for targets to stab. Almost at the same time as they jumped out of the trenches, the machine guns on top of the iron-clad monsters started firing "ka-ka-ka-ka," followed by the sound of a heavy artillery shell "boom," and several soldiers died in the gunfire, falling down in rows. Regiment Commander Ye was so angry that his eyes turned red. He grabbed a hand grenade, aimed at the side of a tank that was crawling over the corpses of the soldiers who had fallen, and threw it. With a "boom," it landed right on the observation deck. The tank immediately stopped moving. Regiment Commander Ye did not hesitate, gripped his command saber, and jumped out of the trench in one stride. (14)

### Sand and Gravel Industry Strike Remains Deadlocked Yesterday; Sand and Gravel Association Petitions the Municipal Council; Over a Hundred Trade Associations Express Sympathy and Support

Regarding the sand and gravel industry strike, it remained deadlocked yesterday. The industry association has decided to petition the Municipal Council this morning. Over one hundred and sixty trade associations expressed their sympathy and support yesterday. Details are as follows:

Still Deadlocked: The sand and gravel workers' strike has been ongoing for four days. Due to the significant differences in opinion between the two sides, no agreement has been reached, and the situation remains deadlocked. Yesterday, Xue Gongxiao, the owner of the Sijiao sand quarry, issued a statement outlining the facts of the case, stating that the Sijiao sand quarry is the property of Yongji Company. After the war, a local bully, Jin Zhengde, organized the "Sijiao Sand and Gravel Maintenance Association" and forcibly seized control, limiting transportation to sixty sailboats. On the Shanghai side, the Wantai Company was established, with one-third of the sand and gravel being supplied to the Japanese. Simultaneously, they used special influence to monopolize the market, raise prices, and cut off the livelihoods of porters and other businesses. Therefore, this industry is fighting for justice based on reason.

Sand and Gravel Association: The association originally contracted with the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council to supply various types of sand and gravel. Ten ships were dispatched to transport sand specifically for the council's use. After Wantai Company forcibly detained the ships, the supply was immediately halted. Therefore, it was decided to send Chairman Lu Xiaozuo and Fang Changgen, among others, to the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council at 10:00 AM this morning with a written petition, requesting that Wantai Company's illegal actions be stopped to benefit the lives of thousands of workers.

Industry Support: Since the strike, the association has sent letters to various public organizations throughout the city, appealing for sympathy and assistance. In the past two days, the Construction Industry, Ham Industry, Flower and Tree Industry, Bicycle Repair Industry, Ship Timber Industry, Fruit Industry, Coal Industry, Machine-made Coal Ball Industry, Firewood and Charcoal Industry, Salted Fish Industry, Western Clothing Industry, Chinese and Foreign General Merchandise Industry, Letterpress Printing Industry, Thermos Bottle Manufacturing Industry, Sauce and Wine Industry, Local Yellow Wine Industry, Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry, Western Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Leaf Industry, Seafood Industry, and over one hundred and sixty other trade associations have sent letters to the association, expressing their sympathy and support, hoping to fight against the evil forces to the end. The various industry associations are willing to be a backing force.

Joint Opposition: A notice from the Sand and Gravel Industry and Fishing Boat Sand Transport Industry associations states: "It has been found that Wantai Company, through the Sijiao Sand and Gravel Maintenance Association, forced out local sand owners (Wang Ji sand owner Chen Sifu and Xue Gongxiao were forced to come to Shanghai), controlled ships transporting sand to Shanghai, and monopolized fishing rights and prices, restricting sales. The facts are clear and need no further proof. Even with regards to the porters and laborers who carry and transport sand and gravel, there are established rules. Why is there a need for bidding? The奸商's (treacherous merchant's) intention is solely to profit. The production and sale of sand and gravel have already been monopolized, and the labor of porters is also being controlled. Therefore, we hope that all sectors will uphold justice, provide assistance, and jointly sanction this illegal organization."

Lawyer's Defense: Jin Xiongbai, the lawyer for Wantai Company, hosted reporters from various newspapers at a Chun Cai Restaurant the night before last. Lawyer Jin first explained his own and Wantai's position, stating that if Wantai were a company organized by traitors, he, with his own integrity, would never defend them. The claim that Wantai seized thirteen sand boats is not true. The Sand and Gravel Association initially accused Wantai of being traitors, then later claimed that Wantai colluded with guerrillas, which is contradictory. At the same time, the Central Police Department's political department has sent detectives to Wantai Company to investigate its organization in detail. In short, the main reason Wantai is facing opposition from the sand and gravel industry is because it has not joined the trade association and is not subject to the association's control.
