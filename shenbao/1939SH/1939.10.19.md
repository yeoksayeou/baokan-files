Editorial

### The US Revision of the Neutrality Act and the Far East

The US Neutrality Act amendment has been under discussion in Congress for a long time. The main points of the bill are twofold: first, to repeal the arms embargo clause; and second, to grant credit loans with a term of ninety days to the belligerent countries. According to a Washington dispatch yesterday, Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who originally proposed the amendment, has already voluntarily withdrawn the second item in order to quickly pass the repeal of the arms embargo clause. The Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Pittman has a very strong sense of justice. Although there are still a few isolationist elements who insist on a narrow view of neutrality, the bill may be resolved reasonably in the near future, given the American people's love of democracy and commitment to justice.

The purpose of the US revision of the Neutrality Act is in fact due to the current Neutrality Act, which is actually unfavorable to democratic countries. However, once amended and the arms embargo clause is repealed, if its scope of effect is not limited to Europe, then in the Far East, the opposite result will occur. Because the "cash and carry" law allows England and France in Europe, which have powerful navies and a large number of merchant ships, to enjoy the convenience of obtaining supplies from the United States. However, China in the Far East has neither a powerful navy nor merchant ships sailing the oceans. Her request for material supplies from the United States may be completely cut off as a result. Japan can take advantage of this clause to purchase military materials from the United States. Although China and Japan have not declared war, the US Neutrality Act does not apply between China and Japan. But in law, Japan can purchase goods and transport them itself, and in fact, who will transport them for China? Therefore, after the Neutrality Act is amended, the United States must also establish remedial measures via legal procedures for the sake of the Far East situation.

Originally, the situation in the Far East is different from that in Europe, and the relationship between the United States and the two regions is also different. Many far-sighted Americans believe that the United States should pay more attention to the Far East than to Europe, because the relationship between the United States and China in terms of geography and economy is very close. A majority of senators in the US Senate believe that if Japan wins in China, it will put the United States in a dangerous position; some even say that China is fighting for the United States today. During the past two years of China's heroic resistance, the US government and people have provided considerable material assistance and spiritual encouragement. And the US Far East policy, from "September 18th" to "July 7th" to the present, has not changed in the slightest. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have repeatedly stated that they respect the Nine-Power Treaty and maintain the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. Recently, the US government has also particularly strengthened its naval and air power in the Pacific, and announced the termination of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, all of which indicate that the United States is determined to adhere to its Far East policy.

The currently debated repeal of the arms embargo clause is certainly unfavorable to China. However, there is reason to believe that just as the United States can promote its sense of justice towards Europe, why can't it take similar action towards the Far East? Pittman has repeatedly cited Japan's massacre of the Chinese people as the reason for the necessity of implementing "cash and carry" when proposing the Neutrality Act amendment. During a debate with isolationist champion Borah in Congress on the 3rd of this month, he also stated that the United States has constantly sold various raw materials for manufacturing munitions to Japan, so the United States is no different than participating in Japan's massacre in China. And yesterday, Democratic Senator Gillette clearly stated that cash and carry will be a direct blow to China; the relationship between the United States and the Far East is extraordinary, so this fact must be taken into account. US Congressmen have cited Japan's aggressive actions in the Far East to explain the necessity of amending the Neutrality Act to enable England and France to receive assistance; they know that the relationship between China and the United States is close and advocate that the United States must take into account the Far East. Then, after the Neutrality Act amendment debate, there will also be some expression towards the Far East, which is not only expected by the general public, but also very possible.

The Neutrality Act is a legal case, amending the Neutrality Act is a legislative procedure, and we have to ask what the outcome of the debate and vote in the US Congress will be, and deeply believe that the United States will still have various methods to maintain its strong foundation for its Far East policy. President Roosevelt has repeatedly declared that opposing military intervention is the United States' foreign policy. Seeing that the United States' passive "non-recognition doctrine" towards Japan's military aggression against China has long passed; the era has already passed; the present is the same as the start of active stepping into the era of resistance following the large-scale exercises of the US fleet concentrated in the Pacific. American citizens are already aware that in order to protect their own rights and interests, they should not hesitate to fight against the aggressive countries in the Pacific; so we can rest assured and not be uneasy about the future of the Neutrality Act amendment regarding the situation in the Far East. It must be known that what China needs at present is still to persevere in its difficult and protracted war of resistance; as time accumulates, it will inevitably cause international sympathy and aid to accumulate into a strong and great force.

### German Air Force Heavily Bombs British Fleet; Several British Ships Slightly Damaged; British Side Shoots Down Several German Planes

London, yesterday, air raid sirens sounded throughout Orkney. In Kirkwall, the sirens wailed six times. German planes were reported to have flown over the islands of Flotta and Hoy.

Four German planes attacked, dropping two bombs near the 21,250-ton training ship HMS Iron Duke. The ship sustained slight damage, but no one was injured. The HMS Iron Duke is an old, decommissioned battleship, converted into a training ship according to the 1930 London Naval Treaty. One German plane was hit by British fire and crashed in flames, and another is believed to have been damaged. The Prime Minister also mentioned the German air raid on the Firth of Forth, stating that twelve or more German planes, in groups of two or three, repeatedly attacked.

HMS Southampton and HMS Edinburgh sustained very minor damage and are ready to sail at any time. The damage to HMS Mohawk was only superficial. British fighters and anti-aircraft guns responded immediately, shooting down a total of four German planes, one of which was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Additionally, several other German planes are believed to have been damaged and unable to return to their base. This attack was local and small in scale, and the British had made various preparations for defense, so it was not considered necessary to issue an air raid alert to avoid disturbances and inconveniences. (Reuters, 17th)

In addition, our Atlantic Fleet captured a German merchant ship." (Havas, 17th)

Paris, the French Army released War Bulletin No. 88 last night, stating that Allied infantry clashed with German troops at several points on the Western Front yesterday. The German army has temporarily abandoned its plan to attack the French Maginot Line. (Associated Press, 18th) Paris, the two recent French bulletins regarding the German offensives east of the Saar indicate significant changes in the fighting on the Western Front. After the collapse of the Polish army, the French commander decided to reorganize the French defenses that extended into German territory to their furthest point, constructing lightly manned watchtowers and dispersing troops. As expected, after heavy artillery bombardment, with most shells landing in open areas, the Germans launched a fierce offensive. At that time, the French outposts retreated according to the planned steps, while using machine guns and artillery to bombard the concentrated German troops and inflict heavy damage. When the German army reached the actual French defense line two and a half miles outside Saarlouis, near the village of Apach, they were blocked by the French army and could not advance. It is widely believed that the German army suffered more losses than gains, gaining little but suffering heavy losses. The fact that the German army encountered resistance and was blocked everywhere is of great significance. Tanks or planes were not used in the battle. The French army is still fighting within German territory. The German army must capture four to six lines of heavily defended positions before they can reach the Maginot Line. (Reuters, 18th)

Paris, the German army launched two major offensives yesterday, the first on the east bank of the Moselle River, on a front six kilometers long, and the second on the east bank of the Saar River, on a front thirty kilometers long, both within German territory. At that time, most of the French army had already withdrawn, leaving only a few outpost troops, so the German army made progress without much difficulty. However, in the past two weeks, the French army had meticulously established a line of resistance behind the outposts. As a result, when the German army reached this line last night, it was met with a dense barrage of machine-gun and artillery fire, like an impenetrable wall, and could not advance a single step. It was impossible even to use hand grenades to attack. Their offensive has now been halted. According to various observers, the German army crossed French minefields during this offensive and suffered heavy shelling, and their losses must have been very heavy. (Havas, 17th)

Berlin, according to a communiqué issued by the German High Command, French troops continued to withdraw from German territory between the Moselle and the Palatinate Forest along the border yesterday. It also stated that one British fighter plane was shot down by the Germans in aerial combat and admitted that one German plane was destroyed and crashed by British anti-aircraft guns. (Reuters, 18th)

Copenhagen, yesterday evening, newspapers here prominently featured or published extras on the news of French troops withdrawing from a certain area near Saarbrücken. People here are paying close attention to this, saying that the French had previously claimed that the German army had voluntarily withdrawn from the area for strategic reasons, and the French had advanced and occupied it, which was a great military success for France. According to French official reports, the French army had previously launched an offensive against German positions in order to restrain the German army and alleviate the pressure on the Polish army. However, two weeks ago, high-ranking French officers decided to withdraw the French army to its original defense. Relevant Danish authorities have commented that now that the Polish war is over, it is noteworthy whether France will continue to occupy German territory or attempt to do so. (Haitong, 18th) Geneva, after the news of the French troops who had occupied German territory returning to France spread, Swiss newspapers believe that this is a symbolic gesture of France temporarily abandoning its offensive against Germany. It is said that in mid-September, rumors spread that the French army planned to take large-scale action, but when Soviet troops entered Poland and attacked the rear of the Polish army, the French army abandoned its large-scale plan. Judging from the recent situation, this seems to be based on some truth. Swiss newspapers believe that the French military authorities have again decided to adopt a defensive strategy. (Haitong, 18th)

### Soviet-Turkish Negotiations Stalled; Friendly Relations Maintained; Turkey Unwilling to Violate Promises to Britain and France; Firmly Unyielding on the Issue of the Tatar Strait; Soviet Ambassador Returns to Post in Same Car as Turkish Foreign Minister

Moscow, Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu, accompanied by his entourage Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Acikalin, First Director Erkin, Head of the Consular Department Polat, departed from here today to return to his country. Those who saw him off at the station included Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, Tikanov, Deputy Chairman of the Moscow Soviet Yasnov, Acting Secretary-General of the Foreign Affairs Committee Subolev, Director of the Protocol Department Bakov, Moscow Garrison Commander Ryfejin, Turkish Ambassador Akte and all embassy staff, diplomatic representatives of various countries stationed in the Soviet Union, etc. In addition to Soviet Director of the Near Eastern Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Novikov and Counselor of the Turkish Embassy Karabuda accompanying Ambassador Saraçoğlu back to his country, Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Terentiev also traveled to Turkey in the same car to resume his post. The station was decorated with the national flags of the Soviet Union and Turkey, and honor guards lined up to send them off. (TASS, 18th)

Moscow, Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu's visit to the Soviet Union has lasted for many days. During this period, representatives of the two governments have discussed in detail all issues concerning relations between the two countries. As a result of the exchange of views in a harmonious atmosphere, the enduring friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey and the common desire of the two governments to maintain peace have been reaffirmed. At the same time, the two governments unanimously agreed to maintain contact in the future so that all issues related to the interests of the two countries can be discussed and addressed together at any time. (TASS, 17th)

Ankara, Turkish Prime Minister Saydam addressed members of parliament of the People's Republican Party today, announcing that the Soviet-Turkish negotiations in Moscow had broken down. It was stated that the talks did not produce a compromise because the new proposals made by the Soviet Union to Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu were incompatible with Turkey's promises to Britain and France. The guarantees offered by the Soviet Union to Turkey could not compensate for the obligations that the Soviet Union wanted Turkey to assume. Regarding the Tatar Strait, Turkey believes that it will not be bound by any other provisions other than those stipulated by its international covenants. Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is currently on his way back to the country. (Reuters, 18th)

Istanbul, after the breakdown of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations, it is reported that Turkey is preparing to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with Britain and France. According to a dispatch from Ankara, it is known in reliable circles in Ankara that this mutual assistance treaty can be signed before the end of this week. (Reuters, 18th)

London, well-informed sources stated that people here are satisfied with the remarks made by Turkish Prime Minister Saydam today regarding the breakdown of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. It is said that Saydam's remarks show that the Soviet Union attempted to persuade Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu to agree to block the Tatar Strait, even though, according to the Montreux Convention, Turkey is responsible for allowing the passage of naval tonnage equivalent only to the strength of the Soviet fleet, which the Soviet Union is still dissatisfied with. The opinion here is that Turkey's action clearly shows its determination to uphold the main war aim of the Allied countries, namely, respecting promised obligations. It is also believed that Turkey's decision will greatly enhance the peaceful outlook of the Balkans and Southern Europe. (Reuters, 18th)

London, the newspapers here have been commenting on the negotiations between Turkey and the Soviet Union. "The Times" stated, "Turkey's refusal to make more concessions to the Soviet Union may have a significant impact on the future of Soviet-German cooperation. If the Soviet Union can reach an agreement with Turkey to prohibit foreign warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits, it will certainly be calmer when considering the risk of joining the war." "The Daily Mail" stated that the fate of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations is the same as the negotiations previously conducted between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement. "The Soviet government apparently made various conditions last week, and it was even rumored that everything had been resolved. In short, after consulting with Britain and France, Turkey had accepted Stalin's views and revised the various provisions of the British-Turkish and French-Turkish agreements. Unexpectedly, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov wanted to gain even greater benefits, so the Turkish government resolutely rejected them." (Havas, 18th)

Moscow, regarding the negotiations between Turkey and the Soviet Union, well-informed sources here stated that since Turkey began negotiations with the Soviet Union on September 25, it has had to decide between the two Allied countries, Britain and France, and the Soviet Union, a difficult problem that is difficult to answer. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu decided to return to his country yesterday to submit a report to the government in person. Therefore, the Soviet-Turkish negotiations have only been temporarily suspended, but not broken down. The Soviet Union's intention is to get Turkey to break away from Britain and France. Although this attempt is beneficial to Germany, in reality, the Soviet Union is still planning for itself. In short, it wants to control the Turkish port of Istanbul and thus control the Dardanelles Strait to realize the ambitions of Peter the Great. However, Turkey itself is quite powerful, and it maintains ties with Britain and France and has the backing of the three Allied countries of Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq (Turkey has signed the Near East Pact with these countries). The Soviet Union cannot apply the same tactics to Turkey as it does to the small countries along the Baltic Sea. As for the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland, although it is not directly related to the Soviet-Turkish negotiations, Finland, influenced by Turkey's attitude, is also resisting the demands made by the Soviet Union. What happens to Finland in the future will depend on the following three points: first, whether Finland's own attitude is resolute; second, whether the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula can provide Finland with assistance; and third, how strong the resistance that Turkey is putting on the Soviet Union is. (Havas, 17th)

I firmly believe that this meeting will further strengthen the solidarity among the Nordic countries since the outbreak of the war.

### Kalinin's Reply to Roosevelt: The Goal of Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Is to Enhance Amity and Cooperation; Finland Hopes to Establish a Compromise Solution with the Determination to Maintain Independence

Copenhagen: The "Politiken" newspaper here recently reported that the Finnish government has drafted several proposals, hoping to establish a compromise solution with the Soviet Union. The proposals will be carried to Moscow by the Finnish envoy to Sweden, Paasikivi, to continue negotiations. As for the Finnish government's attitude, it can be summarized in one sentence: it is prepared to compromise on certain demands made by the Soviet Union, but it is determined to maintain its national independence. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 18th)

Washington: Regarding the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, President Roosevelt, in a personal capacity, sent a telegram to Mikhail Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, on the 12th of this month, stating: "The United States initially does not wish to interfere in the negotiations being conducted by European countries, but there is one thing I would like to bring to your attention, which is that the United States has a deep and long-standing friendship with Finland. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the demands made by your country to Finland will not infringe upon the country's independent sovereignty and hinder the friendly and peaceful relations between your country and Finland. I recall that when the United States and the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations a few years ago, I worked together with you, and I cannot forget it to this day. Therefore, I take the liberty of sending this telegram." Kalinin recently replied to President Roosevelt, stating: "I have read your telegram with great gratitude. Our government recognized the independent sovereignty of the Republic of Finland on December 6, 1917, and concluded a treaty of friendship with it on October 14, 1920, to protect it. The fundamental principles on which Soviet-Finnish relations are based can be seen in these two facts. The current negotiations are also guided by these principles. The information issued in certain quarters is mostly fabricated and has an ulterior motive and cannot be believed. It should be known that the sole goal of these negotiations is to consolidate the current relations between the two sides, strengthen friendly cooperation, and thereby guarantee the security of both sides. I hereby reply for your kind attention." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)

Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax has various reasons to believe that this claim is not without foundation. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### The Soviet Union Plans to Expand Its Influence in the Near East, Coveting Iran's Wealth; the United States Pays Close Attention

New York: According to information from Washington diplomatic circles obtained by a reporter for the "New York Times," the Soviet Union has now extended its ambitions to the Near East. The Soviet Union intends to take advantage of commercial negotiations with Iran (i.e., Persia) to gain control over Iran's wheat production and oil wells, in order to restore its lost influence in northern Iran. Washington considers this move extremely important because Iran occupies a strategically important position in the Near East. How the Soviet Union will advance its demands is a matter of speculation in Washington, and the State Department is paying special attention to the Soviet Union's position and actions. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### The British Government Publishes the Final Report on British-German Negotiations; Hitler Was Surrounded by Extremists, and Göring's Proposals Were Ultimately Not Adopted

London: The British government has recently published a white paper containing the final report of former Ambassador to Berlin Henderson on his negotiations in Germany. This allows a glimpse into Hitler's personality, psychology, and policies. In this report, Henderson speaks of the events of August 30 and 31, saying that German Air Force Minister Göring was willing to resolve the matter peacefully, but everything depended on Hitler's personal decision. Hitler was surrounded by sycophants and encouraged by extremists, even more so than when he advanced into Czechoslovakia. From Hitler's personal perspective and the ambitions of those around him, war was the most agreeable outcome. If Hitler knew that he would face a bloody battle rather than a bloodless victory, he might not have taken this action. One of Hitler's greatest weaknesses was that he had never set foot abroad except for two trips to Italy, so his understanding of British psychology was entirely derived from his Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Ribbentrop's advice was often false, but he was perceptive in other aspects, so Hitler deeply believed in him and regarded him as a second Bismarck, and Ribbentrop also considered himself a second Bismarck. Although the extremely autocratic Hitler was not immune to the influence of his environment, all decisions, calculations, and opportunism were made by Hitler himself. Göring once told him that the head of state alone made the major decisions. After the German army's occupation of Prague violated Prime Minister Chamberlain's promise, British and world public opinion was in an uproar, and Hitler seemed surprised by this reaction. Moderate figures such as former Army Chief Brauchitsch, former Foreign Minister Neurath, and former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Fritsch were not favored by Hitler. Hitler had great faith in his army and air force and did not hesitate to use them against Poland. Hitler told the British ambassador that the war on the Eastern Front would be over in two months, and if Britain unwisely resisted his plan, Germany would deploy 160 divisions to the West. In the negotiations in the days before August 29, Hitler still expressed an attitude of friendship and cooperation, but after newspapers published news of the killing of six Germans by Poles on August 29, Hitler's attitude changed. The news of Poles killing Germans was likely fabricated by extremists, fearing that Hitler would back down. In his report, Henderson assessed Hitler's characteristics and psychology, saying that Hitler, like many Germans, both envied and resented the achievements of the British, and because Britain resisted Germany's excessive desires, he turned his envy and resentment into hatred. Hitler often referred to Britain as the representative of aristocratic politics and the most successful of the Nordic nations. Hitler had always wanted to exchange a treaty and guarantees with Britain for Britain's recognition of his grand plans, but his greatest mistake was that he completely misunderstood the inherent morality, humanity, and concepts of freedom of the British people.

### Chamberlain Reports in the House of Commons: Allied Forces Have Achieved Satisfactory Results; British Expeditionary Force Enters the Maginot Line; German Submarines Cannot Hinder British Overseas Trade; British Air Force Shows Superiority in Recent Air Battles

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain, in his weekly opinion on the war situation in the House of Commons today, said that Berlin had not expressed the German government's opinion on the war, which he was trying to clarify. Last week, he had replied to Hitler's peace plan, and he could not add anything to what he had said at that time. He went on to say that German propaganda agencies were making every effort to distort the facts in order to make foreign commentaries on the German side's views appear slightly better. This was a futile effort, and almost all neutral countries, regardless of party affiliation, unanimously expressed their sympathy to the Allied governments. This fact was difficult to conceal. The war had caused inconvenience to non-belligerent countries, but it had clearly not obscured the fundamental issues. The resolution of these issues, whether beneficial or harmful, would affect the spiritual and material well-being of neutral countries no less than that of belligerent countries. On the Western Front, the British Expeditionary Force had reached an agreement with the French army on the assigned sector, and the divisions had occupied their positions. The senior French and British commanders had a complete understanding of everything. The British Expeditionary Force was now under the command of the French Commander-in-Chief, so the effect of unified command had been achieved in the initial stage of the war. This was one proof of harmony between the two sides, and another proof was that the two sides had agreed that French troops would also serve under the British Commander-in-Chief stationed in France. The Prime Minister went on to discuss the naval warfare, praising the efforts of the navy. He then said that the naval personnel had suffered serious losses while fulfilling their duties this week. The House of Commons would like to express its condolences to the members of the army, navy, and air force who died in defense of the country. In discussing the activities of German submarines, he said that the losses suffered by British ships entering and leaving various ports in the week ending October 17 were only 5/1000 of the total, which showed that the German submarines' efforts to damage British trade by attacks had failed. Enemy aircraft had begun to attack British fleet bases, but had failed to inflict significant damage on British ships. Air battles had taken place on the coast in the last two days, destroying eight enemy aircraft, while no British aircraft had been lost. Some enemy bombers may not have been able to return home. The enemy aircraft engaged in combat numbered less than thirty, and the losses were so heavy that they could not be considered light. We should not be foolishly complacent in the initial stages of this war, nor should we think that we will always be able to achieve the current victory. There will be many surprising news in the war, not all of which will be pleasant, but such results at the beginning are at least satisfactory. The Prime Minister also praised the Royal Air Force for its courageous operations in his speech. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### German Propaganda No Longer Mentions Peace

Berlin: German politicians and public opinion no longer discuss the issue of peace negotiations. The only topic of conversation is the operations of the British navy. It is generally believed that the end of the Polish war was the first phase of the war, the rejection of peace proposals to Germany was the second phase, and the fierce struggle between Britain and Germany was the third phase. We are now entering the third phase of the war. During this period, the German navy's various measures and activities are receiving a great deal of attention. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)

### Another British Cargo Ship Sunk by German Submarine; Norwegian Ship "Hansen" Sinks in the Atlantic; German Submarine Commander Describes the Sinking of a British Ship

London: The British cargo ship "Mantilla" has been sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean. According to reports received from the shipowners, all crew members have been rescued. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 18th)

Oslo: According to news from Bergen yesterday, the Norwegian ship "Hansen" sank in the North Atlantic while en route from Canada to England. All 21 people on board were rescued. It is not yet clear whether it was hit by a torpedo or exploded by a mine. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

London: According to German radio broadcasts, the commander of the German submarine that sank the British battleship "Royal Oak" has been awarded the Iron Cross First Class by Hitler, and the crew members have each been awarded the Iron Cross Second Class for their meritorious service. The commander of the German submarine fleet, Dönitz, has been promoted to Rear Admiral. It is reported that the submarine that destroyed the "Royal Oak" arrived at its base at 9:00 am yesterday, and German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder personally welcomed it. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Berlin: The submarine that sank the British battleship "Royal Oak" and damaged the British cruiser "Repulse" returned to a German port yesterday. Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder and many officers welcomed them at the port. On behalf of Führer Hitler, the entire navy and the people of the country, Admiral Raeder expressed his gratitude to the officers and men of the submarine for their achievements. The submarine commander, Prien, immediately reported on the sinking of the British "Royal Oak," saying that when the submarine sailed into Scapa Flow, it caught sight of two enemy warships, and he ordered the firing of torpedoes. In an instant, there was a loud explosion, and a high surge of water was seen in the distance. The farther one was hit by a torpedo and immediately burst into flames. Seconds later, the closer one was also hit by a torpedo. After the incident, the British immediately released black smoke to cover up the truth, but after the black smoke dispersed, looking at the scene of the incident, the farther one had disappeared without a trace, and the side of the closer one was submerged in the water. The ship had two funnels, which was probably the cruiser "Repulse." After completing its mission, the submarine sailed away from the bay at full speed. The bay was lit up with searchlights and radio codes were sent out. It was then heard that heavy objects were falling in the bay, probably because the navy in the bay still believed that the submarine was still in the bay and dropped explosives. The commander continued to say that the submarine was determined to sink the British battleship "Royal Oak" and the cruiser "Repulse" in one fell swoop, and that this achievement was entirely due to the concerted efforts of all the officers and men of the submarine. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)

Milan: According to the "Sella Report," British sailors rescued from the "Royal Oak" published a description of the ship being bombed in London, saying: "I was asleep at the time, and the sudden explosion of the torpedoes woke me up. I immediately jumped out of bed and ran to the lifeboat to check the situation. At that time, the torpedoes were continuously hitting the ship, four times in total, and the ship was tilting and gradually sinking. All the officers and men on board immediately jumped onto the lifeboats to escape, and many drowned in the sea." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)

London: The Admiralty has issued a communiqué stating that a total of 424 officers and men have been rescued from the battleship "Royal Oak," and the remaining 810 have died. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 18th)

The Hague: According to news from Berlin, the officers and men of the German submarine that sank the British battleship "Royal Oak" returned to a German port yesterday and immediately boarded a plane to Berlin, where they paraded through the city and were warmly welcomed by the people.

### The U.S. Government Continues to Expand Its Military; Roosevelt Announces Continued Expansion Plan and Will Request Congress to Approve Additional Budget

Washington: President Roosevelt announced yesterday the government's continued naval expansion plan and declared that he would request an increase of 10,000 personnel in the army, navy, and air force when Congress convenes its regular session in January. The President did not specify what kind of new ships would be added to the navy, but observers indicated that if Congress passes the President's proposal to increase the personnel of the army, navy, and air force, the U.S. Navy would be the largest since 1919. The President told reporters that the purpose of the current naval expansion program was to enable the United States to have a large navy in peacetime, but it would still not enable the country to have a complete fleet. The actual need of the United States was to expand and improve the navy to adapt to global naval standards. The President continued, "The naval problem cannot be solved by 'beautiful slogans' such as 'two ships exchanged for one ship' and 'two-ocean navy.'" He said that the so-called "complete fleet" itself must be affected by changing circumstances, so new plans must be made annually according to new circumstances. When Congress convenes its regular session in January, he will ask Congress to consider increasing funding for the army, navy, and Marine Corps, and to appropriate funds to改造 many destroyers from the First World War for "neutrality patrol" work.

### Singapore's Defenses Are Consolidated; Volunteer Force Is About to Be Mobilized; Malaya Encourages Rice Cultivation

Singapore: According to an official announcement here, the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force is about to be ordered to mobilize. This volunteer force has several thousand merchants and civilians, so when the mobilization order is issued, efforts will be made to ensure that it does not affect the conduct of commerce and trade. According to Governor Thomas, this volunteer force occupies an extremely important position in the defense of Singapore, so that the British government does not have to transfer troops from the Western Front in Europe to here. Except for the officers, the volunteer air force has been temporarily allowed to return to their former occupations. The official has issued several announcements regarding defense exercises and asked the people not to lightly believe "rumors." The economic assistance of Malaya in this war can be seen in Sir Chiley's speech at the annual meeting of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce. He said that during this period we must transport as much tin and rubber and other goods as possible to Britain and its allies. Governor Thomas gave a detailed report on the defense of Singapore in a broadcast to the people of Malaya. The defense force stationed in India has been transferred to Singapore, and British defense forces have also arrived one after another. Thomas also said that the situation in Singapore is very good, as usual, and outsiders may not be able to detect that the British Empire is at war, but this small island is actually a nest of aircraft and is stationed with a large defense force. With the cooperation of the governments of the various colonies, British Malaya is planning to increase rice production. Malaya today requires two-thirds of its total rice from outside, mostly from Thailand, Burma, and Indochina. The government's new plan will encourage farmers to cultivate new land and pay them fees, and guarantee the minimum price of rice produced in the first three years. The Federal Malay Government has agreed that non-Malays can join in rice cultivation to relieve this emergency period. This can further increase rice production. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

### Various Fronts in Northern Jiangsu: Japanese Troops Retreating Towards Huai'an and Huaiyin; Impact of Japanese Defeat in Northern Hunan; Chinese Troops Have Recovered Baoying County; Puppet Troops Mutiny Upon Encountering Resistance

Xinghua Correspondence: The war situation in northern Jiangsu has improved recently. Despite the Japanese troops' best efforts, they failed to break through the second line of defense of the Chinese troops. Their morale has plummeted. Furthermore, the great victory of the Chinese troops in northern Hunan has shaken the Japanese troops in various parts of central China. This has also had a related impact on the war situation in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the Japanese troops invading various fronts in northern Jiangsu underwent significant changes after the 3rd and 4th of this month. After a fierce counter-offensive by the Chinese troops, the Japanese began to retreat on the 5th. In places such as Caodian, Cuibao, Tatar Tou, Mayizhuang, Zhangjiazhen, Hongjiaqiao, Yangnianzhen, Jinghe, and Pingqiao, the Japanese troops encountered the brave counter-offensive of the Chinese XXX Army on the 5th. After a fierce battle lasting a day and a night, the Japanese troops were defeated on the 6th. The Chinese troops successively recovered these places on the same day and pursued the retreating Japanese troops. By noon on the 7th, the Japanese troops north of Baoying and south of Pingqiao were completely cleared, and a large number of war trophies were seized and are being inventoried. As of 7:00 PM, the majority of the Japanese troops between Huaiyin and Baoying had retreated to the Huai'an and Huaiyin areas. The Chinese troops have restored their pre-war positions. The Japanese troops in the Gaoyou area are still stubbornly defending the county seat and positions such as Cheluo and Lujin. The Chinese troops have surrounded the Japanese troops on three sides. At dawn on the 7th, there were still localized fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese troops. The Japanese troops in the Rugao area launched another attack on the Chinese troops' positions at dawn on the 7th. After a fierce battle lasting three hours, the Japanese troops failed and retreated. Although Jiangba and Xuyi, west of Gaobao Lake, unfortunately fell on the 3rd, the XXX unit of the Chinese troops on that front had established contact with the local authorities on the 7th and transferred to a suitable location in XXX, preparing to wait for an opportunity to counter-attack.

Another report: The situation in northern Jiangsu has become increasingly stable recently. The Japanese troops, who fiercely attacked southern Huaiyin, suffered heavy casualties and a significant loss of morale after encountering separate counter-offensives by the Chinese troops. Therefore, they have been retreating to Huai'an and Huaiyin in recent days. Before leaving, they set fire to civilian houses and wantonly destroyed everything, showing that they dare not launch another offensive. On the 8th, the Chinese authorities frequently received telephone reports from the front, stating that after Baoying was recovered by the Chinese troops, the Japanese troops were pressed hard by the Chinese troops and retreated in haste. Therefore, they did not have time to burn civilian houses in the city. Currently, the Chinese troops have entered Baoying County, and many people have returned one after another. County Magistrate Liu Bairong has also arrived in the county to comfort the people. Huangpu, Jinghe, and Pingqiao were officially recovered on the 8th. The fires set by the Japanese troops were extinguished by the Chinese troops. After the Japanese troops in Caodian, Cuibao, and other places were defeated, the vanguard of the Chinese troops moved into various places, and the fires were also extinguished. It is estimated that thousands of civilian houses were burned, and the people suffered heavy losses. It is also learned that the Japanese troops were extremely undisciplined during this invasion and engaged in widespread rape and looting of the people who had not escaped the war zone. Furthermore, the puppet troops mixed in with the Japanese troops collapsed in disarray upon encountering fierce resistance from the Chinese troops. Therefore, the Japanese line of defense could not be consolidated. The Japanese troops' fighting spirit is also far inferior to what it once was. Their clothing is tattered, and they are in a state of decline. This retreat was extremely embarrassing. After the Chinese troops switched from defense to offense, their morale was boosted, creating glorious results. It is also learned that senior Chinese military officers have personally gone to the front to command and supervise the troops.

During this Japanese invasion of the Gaobao line, the Chinese troops from all directions resisted, braving arrows and shedding blood, and endured extreme hardship. The Jiangsu Provincial Mobilization Committee of the Lu-Su War Zone, in conjunction with various sectors, launched a comfort delegation to carry supplies and set off for the front. It is reported that the comfort delegation has been determined by the general team of Comfort and Self-Defense of the Chinese Women's Comforting and Self-Defense Association of Jiangsu Province, and representatives from various groups have been sent out in two teams to the front.

### Japanese Troops in Suzhou: Extremely Weak Strength

Setting Up Artillery Positions to Make a Show of Force

Suzhou Correspondence: Although there are troops such as the Kikawa, Tsuji, and Hirono units, as well as the military police, stationed in Suzhou, in reality, except for the Hirono unit, which is a division, all the others are independent combined brigades. In total, there are about 40,000 troops. Recently, the Ishikawa unit was transferred to central China for operations, so its number is now less than 30,000. These less than 30,000 Japanese troops are stationed in this area and in Yihe, Wuxi, Wujin, Changshu, Qian, Taicang, and other counties. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Japanese military strength in the middle section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is very weak. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese troops in various places were busy with minor adjustments, which made their strength even weaker. The Japanese troops remaining in Suzhou continue to move around every day, making a show of force. Currently, from the railway station to the starting point of the Suzhou-Changshu highway, barbed wire is erected along the way. In addition to installing a 3-inch flat-shooting gun at the Pingmen wharf of the former Changshu steamship, many concrete bunkers have been built nearby. Each bunker has a machine gun installed. There are often three to five Japanese soldiers patrolling in teams nearby. At night, people are prohibited from passing through. Their purpose is clearly to defend against attacks by the Chinese troops.

Furthermore, after the Lou, Qi, Feng, Lu, Xu, Pan, Jin, and Ping eight city gates of this city were occupied by the Japanese troops, each gate was assigned two or thirty soldiers to guard it. However, the Qian gate has not been opened because the Japanese troops are defending against attacks by Chinese mobile units. Recently, in order to revitalize the Japanese concession (established by the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the Sino-Japanese War of the Qing Dynasty), a new city gate has been opened at the site of the old Shemen gate. Workers have been hired to build it. Regarding the full authority over the opening and closing of the city gates, the Japanese troops have completely transferred it to the puppet organization for management starting on the 10th of this month. The Japanese troops only have five soldiers stationed at each city gate.

### Japanese Troops from Songjiang Invade Zhangyan

Qianjiawei is Also Disturbed

Songjiang Correspondence: More than 500 Japanese troops from the Uchida unit in Songjiang, yesterday divided into five small motorboats, seven civilian boats, and five small steel cannons, invaded Jinshanwei, Zhangyan, and other places. They were met by Chinese troops, and the fighting lasted for a day. At the same time, Oinaka of the Japanese troops in Jinshan also led a team to attack Maoqiao at night but was repulsed. The Japanese troops then changed their strategy and attacked the position of Shen's Chinese troops in front of the Yamen in three routes. Two routes advanced along the Huanggu Canal from Baziqiao and Sanliqiao Dam. When they reached Qianjiawei, they were ambushed by Chinese troops from Langxia, and the Japanese troops also collapsed and retreated. The corpses left behind were all carried to Zhujing for cremation.

### Letter

To the Editor, Greetings, I am writing regarding the Jiashan correspondence in your newspaper of the 2nd of this month, which stated that the opium and narcotics promoted by the official opium suppression bureau, whose pseudo-director is Shen Wenbing, and the chief of the Japanese pacification team, Ogata, own half of all the shares. It also stated that Yu Yunmen and Lu Jimin also invested 1,500 yuan, etc. After investigation, I have not invested in this bureau. The information is likely based on an erroneous rumor, and I request a correction to show accuracy. Best regards, Yu Yunmen, October 12,

### Overview of National Higher Education Moral Education (1): Moral Education System Gradually Improving Towards Perfection

(Chongqing Special Dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently prepared a detailed report by the responsible department on the standards of the moral education system in colleges and universities across the country, the implementation of the tutor system, and youth groups. Excerpts of the original text are as follows:

Moral education in our country's schools, except for middle and primary schools, which have specific regulations in the middle school regulations and primary school regulations, and where schools have moral education personnel dedicated to this task, there is no legal basis for moral education in colleges and universities. Most schools also do not have moral education personnel, so in the past, there was almost no moral education. Since the occurrence of several student movements, the government and educators have gradually realized the importance of moral education in colleges and universities. In 1930, the Executive Yuan issued an order to rectify the academic atmosphere, which the Ministry of Education forwarded to various schools for compliance. In the same year, the Second National Education Conference specifically proposed improving moral education in the resolution on the plan to improve higher education. It emphasized cultivating a sound character to serve the country and society based on the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation guidelines. In 1931, the 17th Standing Committee of the Third Central Executive Committee passed the "Principles for the Implementation of the Three People's Principles Education," which also included a special chapter on moral education. It stipulated nine items regarding moral education in colleges and universities, which the Ministry of Education ordered various schools to implement, ensuring that teachers guide students' self-study outside of teaching so that teachers and students can interact frequently to achieve the effect of personal influence. Some schools implemented it at the time, but it did not have a widespread effect. At the same time, it also issued a notice to colleges and universities across the country to submit their moral education policies and implementation details for review and approval as a reference for drafting moral education standards. In 1932, the Executive Yuan issued an order to rectify education, which also focused on the reorganization of moral education in schools. In 1932, it specifically issued the Measures for Military Management of Schools Above High School, aiming to cultivate students' cleanliness, agility, diligence, simplicity, endurance, unity, mutual assistance, vigorous spirit, and obedience to discipline. Students' daily lives were subject to military management. In recent years, it has become increasingly urgent to promote moral education in colleges and universities. Therefore, in February 1938, the Outline for Youth Training was promulgated as a guideline for moral education in schools. In April of the same year, a Moral Education Research Committee was established to study and promote practical issues of moral education in schools at all levels and social education. The Outline for the Tutor System in Secondary and Higher Schools was also promulgated, and guidelines for implementing the tutor system were given. Schools established directors of tutors and tutors to guide students in groups. Newly established schools even set up moral education departments to be specifically responsible for moral education. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect the moral education affairs of various schools at any time to facilitate improvement. As a result, the moral education system in colleges and universities has gradually become perfect.

### Seventh Session of Government-Funded Students Studying in the UK: To Go Abroad in Autumn Next Year

Eighth Session to be Held in Two Years

The Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund selected 24 government-funded students to study in the UK this year. They originally planned to gather in Hong Kong on September 16 to take a ship to go abroad. However, due to the outbreak of the European War, and the war declared by Britain and France against Germany, problems arose in transportation and safety. The departure was temporarily postponed. Since the European War is likely to be prolonged, the departure date is difficult to determine. Therefore, all the selected students have been notified to suspend dispatch this year. According to the Shanghai office of the association, it has been decided that the 24 government-funded students selected this year will depart in the autumn of next year after the European situation may have stabilized. The eighth session of recruitment will be postponed to two years later.

### Finance Currency Market Quiet, Exporters Slightly Offer, Resulting in US Dollar Stable, British Pound Slightly Tight

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The unofficial market for US dollars against British pounds was generally stable. The opening saw overseas US dollar to British pound exchange rate continuing to extend to 875, reaching the four yuan mark, hence the British pound tightened by 0.015625, reaching four shillings and five pence, 78125. The US dollar remained unchanged. Subsequently, due to the Hong Kong Electric, Chinese banks, and exporters offering, the market once hardened to British gold at four pence six and a quarter. US dollar foreign exchange once traded at 7.6875. However, HSBC's intentions to buy rose, and sellers suddenly became scarce, causing the market to soften. The US dollar tightened to 7.5625, and British gold to four pence five and a quarter. Extending to the noon closing, British gold remained at four pence five and a quarter, and the US dollar at 7.625, both seeking shared fortunes and misfortunes. The process was exceptionally dull. The futures trend mirrored the spot market, with extremely few inquiries. The foreign exchange future has become an easy-to-loosen and difficult-to-tighten trend, likely due to the escalating tensions on the Western Front in Europe, which are not unrelated. Half-day trading was quiet.

US Dollar to British Pound Exchange Rate Reaches Four Yuan

Early morning saw London's large contracts recently shortening by 1875, and deferred contracts decreasing by 4375. The New York silver price fell by one cent, and London's gold remained stagnant. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai yuan, French francs, etc., were offered at par. The US dollar lengthened by 875 against the British pound, reaching four yuan, and increased by five cents against the Shanghai yuan, and decreased by a small eight and three quarters against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of British gold at four pence five and a quarter, and US dollar at 7.625, compared to the previous closing, the British pound slightly tightened by 0.015625, and the US dollar remained unchanged, due to the increase in exchange rates. After opening, the first telegram from Hong Kong offered, and Chinese banks and exporters also slightly offered. Therefore, the market was stable with a tendency to harden. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric, Chinese banks, and exporters sold spot British gold to HSBC, favorably and to certain American banks at five shillings and nine and three-quarters and six and a quarter pence, and spot US dollar at 7.65625. At the same time, a certain bank absorbed spot US dollar at 7.6875 from other banks. HSBC's listed prices were announced as unchanged, and the announcement of the silver equalization tax also showed no rise or fall. Thereafter, sellers gradually decreased, and foreign banks' appetite increased, causing the situation to soften to four pence five and a quarter and 7.5625. At noon, the situation turned flat. Extending to the noon closing, banks' spot selling prices were British gold at four pence five and a quarter, and US dollar at 7.625, the same as the previous price for this month. November's British gold was four pence five and a quarter, and US dollar at 7.5 yuan. As a result, the average spot British pound tightened slightly by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, while the US dollar showed no difference. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

### Gold Market Mediocre

Yesterday's cash "Ha Chi" unofficial market situation: first low, then high, and finally returning to par, forming a mountain shape. The process can be described as mediocre. Initially, due to the hardening of foreign exchange and the lack of "Ke Bang" (visiting merchants) coming to buy, it opened at 4,000 yuan. Further aggravated by the fierce buying by money changers, it once plunged into the 4,000 yuan mark, reaching 3,998 yuan. Later, hearing that foreign exchange had softened, retail investors suddenly entered the market to search and buy. Hong Kong banks vigorously purchased afterward, slowly pushing the price back to a high of 4,014 yuan. Subsequently, it hovered around 4,010 yuan. Until the afternoon, when money changers again sold, it once retreated to 4,006 yuan, but securities firms bought in slightly, resulting in a return to par at 4,010 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, due to the lack of foreign exchange market on Wednesday, the market closed early at 3:00 PM. Overall trading was still strong, with a volume of about 1,000 taels. Gold ornaments in silver shops remained unchanged, and customs gold remained at par.

"Ha Chi" Unclear Fortunes

Since morning, each bar (ten taels) initially had weak demand, and there were many sellers. A certain money changer was even more eager to sell. The opening price was suppressed by a small ten yuan. A certain money changer sold 20 taels to a colleague, priced at 4,000 yuan. Instantly, it was suppressed by another two yuan. A certain money changer sold another 30 taels to a gold shop, priced at 3,998 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms absorbed at low prices, and retail investors also followed slightly. Soon it returned to a high of twelve yuan. A securities firm bought 10 taels from a money changer, priced at 4,010 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly started selling, and silver shops also sold off dozens of taels, gradually decreasing by five yuan. A certain gold shop sold 20 taels to a silver shop, priced at 4,005 yuan. Soon after hearing that foreign exchange had softened slightly, buyers came to push up the price. Before long, it returned to the 4,010 yuan mark. However, at that time, a securities firm suddenly acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks, vigorously absorbing more than 300 taels, causing the price to rise again to 4,014 yuan, all supplied by silver shops and gold shops. Nearing noon, the securities firm suddenly stopped buying and instead sold off, resulting in a decrease of a small four yuan. Money changers mutually traded 20 taels, priced at 4,010 yuan. Later, they raised it by another two yuan. A money changer bought 10 taels from a securities firm, priced at 4,012 yuan as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, because a certain money changer suddenly had the intention to sell, the opening price was suppressed by four yuan. A certain money changer sold 10 taels to a gold shop, priced at 4,008 yuan. Later, they vigorously sold off dozens of taels, causing it to fall again by two yuan. A certain money changer sold 30 taels to a colleague, priced at 4,006 yuan. After entering, a certain securities firm came to buy, and sellers were observing and not advancing, resulting in a rebound of four yuan. A certain securities firm bought 20 taels from a gold shop, priced at 4,010 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was unclear whether it rose or fell compared to the previous day. There were sixteen yuan of ups and downs throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand of gold was ten yuan higher than "Ha Chi". Buying back required a deduction of about thirty yuan. The current bid gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and transactions were rare.

No Change in Ornaments

The exchange price per tael of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged from day to day due to the stagnant ups and downs of "Ha Chi." The large "Datongxing" shop still hung at 405 yuan. The new "Tongxing" shop had the same price as before, and buying back required a reduction of about twenty yuan.

### Securities Domestic Debt Slight Decline, Foreign Stocks Show Foreign Intentions

Yesterday's unofficial market for unified public bonds: with depressing news from all sides, the market atmosphere suddenly turned quiet. And the peaceful atmosphere of the past few days had dissipated, and the bullish camp seemed to be shaken and no longer active. Therefore, the market atmosphere was quiet, and prices gradually declined during the meandering. When trading opened in the morning, the market price was stable at first, and then presented a high disk because Lianyi Dafeng successively collected vigorously, and then Suikang alone purchased Type E. Then, Russian Tiansheng Datong and retail investors successively supplied and sold, and the seekers turned rare, and the market atmosphere was weakly supported, and the father softened. The afternoon trend was still sluggish, and Songmao and Yongxiang began to sell off. Only Yongkang and Houda slightly accepted the purchase, resulting in a continued decline in the market price. As a result of the whole-day rivalry, they all fell back from one corner to three corners, and the transaction was called ten thousand yuan.

Fifty shares of Ning Shao Steamship shares were traded, priced at eight yuan.

Moreover, yesterday's stock market in the Public Works Bureau was generally interesting and did not see any reduction. The brokers were very busy due to the crowding of entrustments, but there was no sudden disturbance. The price maintenance was also good. Huidefeng shares returned to the previous day's high of 62 yuan, and Yesu Shipyard shares saw a new high price of 176.5 yuan. The Telephone Company shares continued to advance to 18 yuan. If the silver roots are long and loose, and the major households still want to carefully maintain the market, it is also very easy to support the price without falling. However, if the profit-making bulls suddenly emerge in large quantities, or the foreign exchange market, which is sufficient to reuse excellent remuneration funds, then the situation will suddenly turn against them, and it is not known whether investors or speculators will regret their current actions beyond their ability.

London, 17th Telegram: Today's listing market for British businessmen's distant bundle companies' stocks was generally calm, with only the Megalith Bank shares rising by two shillings and six pence, priced at seven pounds two shillings and six pence, and the rest remaining unchanged.

London, 17th Telegram: Today's listing market for foreign prices in China has returned to calm, and there is no change in the market conditions of the upper and lower bonds.

### Yarn and Cotton Foreign Yarn Prices Cheaper Than Shanghai, Sales to Customers Therefore Hopeless

The yarn market is still in a state of fatigue, and the downward trend is gradually intensifying, which is really due to the weakness of yarn sales, the loosening of factory roots, and the increasing number of spot chips. The foundation of the yarn market is not strong. As for general speculators, in view of the stability of foreign exchange, and the decline in the market price of all commodities, their interest is waning. Another saying is that the price of yarn in foreign ports is cheaper than that in Shanghai. Not only can transportation not make a profit, but it will also lose money. Therefore, the ability to purchase has been greatly reduced. In short, unless the actual demand improves, the market may not appear in a new posture.

The opening of the current yarn market in the morning still cannot get rid of the fatigue. Although many parties want to shout high, there is a real lack of buyers. All the transactions belong to the flow of snatching the limelight. The market is not strong, and the opening price of Shuangma spot is 709 yuan, and soon it will reach 711 yuan. The stack unit price has been delayed for a long time, and the opening price is 695 yuan. Soon after hearing that the factory has the intention to open a large amount of sales, it is currently under negotiation, and people's hearts are slowly loosening. Gradually, the closing Shuangma fell to 700 yuan, and the stack unit price was 692 yuan. It is found that 1,340 packages were traded in half a day, and the market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 9 yuan, Tiannv fell by 2 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu fell by 2 yuan. Today, 2,385 pieces of yarn were transported to Tianjin. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left,

Fellow traders 790 Hong Kong 385

Quanzhou 10 Jiangxi 50

Xiamen 10 Mainland 95

Statistics 1,340

Also, it was once rumored in yesterday's market that Shenxin No. 9 Factory would open a price of 700 yuan for 20-count Shuangma yarn, and a certain yarn number had opened 500 packages. The common yarn number still thought this price was too expensive and did not intend to accept it, and the asking price was within the 700 yuan mark. As a result, it did not open. Judging from the general trend, it is currently under separate negotiation.

### This Cotton Mill Suspends Business, Fellow Traders Start Ordering American Cotton

The transaction of this cotton has greatly decreased, which is due to the step-by-step decline of the yarn market, and the various factories have no intention to replenish. The transaction has turned silent. Chinese and foreign factories have only not handled the package, only fellow traders have entered 1,000 packages of Tongzhou cotton, priced at 135 yuan to 137 yuan, delivered by bank notes, with the source of northern Jiangsu, and 1,540 pills of Tongzhou cotton, and 5,170 packages from Beisha.

Another news, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday was quite prosperous because of the firmness of the New York cotton market. Although the factory still holds a hope, fellow traders have already started to order American cotton. Although the number is very huge, the opening is the number of 1,000 packages. This American cotton can be used for spinning 20 counts. According to the current exchange rate, the factory price is only 170 yuan, which is much higher than the high-grade Tongzhou in terms of grade.

Foreign Cotton Market Price, New York cotton market, was very firm in the early morning, and the telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai were all good. Speculators bought very actively, and the textile industry also had a healthy appetite due to the sales of cloth. It also rose due to the purchase of fellow traders and the firmness of the stock market on Wall Street. As a result, compared with the previous day's price, the cotton price rose by eight to ten pounds. The Indian even forecast a rise of two rupees, the Egyptian fell by five or six pounds, and the Liverpool rose by a penny.

### Grain Grain Prices Difficult to Stabilize, Many Culprits

Yesterday, all sources only transported about 3,000 packages of new goods from Jiangsu, Kun, Qing, Jia, and other raw packages by wheels. There was a shortage of goods outside the river. Because of the few arrivals, people's hearts were strong, and there were rumors in the market that there was a shortage of rice for a while, which was the old habit of a certain party, specializing in intercepting us. The reason why a certain party intercepted was precisely because its internal unification was not uniform. The travel permit issued by Party A was not recognized by Party B, and the travel permit of Party B was not recognized by Party C. Secondly, it wanted to use the power of detention to carry out its squeeze. Thirdly, it wanted to use war to support war and secretly wanted to make a fortune from rice and grain. Fourth, Japan lacks tenant farmers, fertilizer is expensive, and there is a shortage of 17 million to 20 million stones of rice, and it is not without a part that wants to take it from China. It allows its southern gang rice, which is coveted by them. Although the quality of Chinese rice is not as good as Japanese rice, at the time of food shortage, it also wants to dye its fingers. Sixthly, Tianjin has banned grain exports. With this kind of local speculative elements, they took advantage of the opportunity to make a big splash. They did not know that the major rice-producing areas were still controlled by the Chinese guerrillas, and the rice and grain that Japan could control and control was only limited to the occupied areas. Therefore, the harm to Chinese food was minimal. The rice merchants and hoarders took advantage of the fire to rob and competed to take the lead. In a short time, the situation was unusually barren, and the general customers all regarded it as a rare commodity, and made it at random, and the shouting was high. In the Central City, the general hoarders, who had been absent for a long time, were even more sensationalized. The market price of each commodity has been shouted up by more than two yuan. Until the noon market, the price of each commodity was too high, and the general prudent people's minds did not see any slight despair, so they all stood by and watched the wind, and then borrowed to seek the strategy of advance and retreat in order to control the victory, so the zero and lump stomachs were weakened again, so the closing market price of each commodity was not as good as the shouting. The price was too high, and it was also more varied. As a result of the broken price, it added up to about one yuan. The Changbang special broke 33 yuan, Wuxi special broke 32 yuan, Gao 31 yuan, Central City 30 yuan, Jue 28 yuan, and Su Tong broke 28 yuan to 26 yuan. The various new japonica and the variety of Bai Ge were less than the market goods, allowing a price of one yuan and forty-five cents or more. If Changzhou's new japonica special is 30 yuan, the market is 29 yuan, and Kunsu's new japonica is 29 yuan to 26 yuan, Jue is about 25 yuan, and Qingjiao's variety opens at 31 yuan, Fengjing's special Bai Ge is 3 yuan and 2 cents, and Jiashan's market goods are 28 yuan and 9 yuan, and the situation is similar to that of new japonica. Although the shouting of Yanglu tip and the general customer tip was also fierce in the early market, it was difficult to keep pace with the rising wind of the japonica market because the market goods were more abundant, so the closing price of each was about half a yuan to one yuan higher than the previous market. If Nanjing No. 1 tip is 10 yuan and 5 cents, No. 2 tip is 20 yuan and 1 or 2 cents, 20 yuan, No. 3 tip is 19 yuan and a half, Wuhu special tip is 20 yuan and 4 or 5 cents, the market is 20 yuan, the middle is 19 yuan and 7 cents, 19 yuan and a half, Jue is 19 yuan, 18 yuan and 8 cents, Shi tip is 18 yuan, 17 yuan and a half, Jiangbei tip is 20 yuan and 19 yuan and 7 cents, and Changxi Suku Fengjia and other special sheep tips are 23 yuan and a half to 22 yuan, and the special reed tips are 24 yuan and 2 cents to 22 yuan and a half. Although the road to the old and new variants is not as wide as that of the japonica tip, the market price is also brought up by half a yuan to one yuan, Chen Wu is 31 or 2 yuan, Xin Yuan is 26 or 7 yuan, and the total market transaction volume is not less than 15,000 or 6,000 packages.

The customer Xian rose very sharply in the market yesterday. The reason is that after the tragic fall a few days ago, the transporters from Jiangbei and other places have stopped, so the arrivals at the end of the day have been sparse. Although the price has risen to transport, the issue of obtaining a purchase certificate has not been resolved, and the transporters have not dared to handle it with pleasure. Yesterday, the supply in the market was sharply reduced, and in addition to the zero households in the local street and village, there were also inland gangs absorbing in the market, so the high-grade Xian has risen to about 21 yuan, which is half a yuan to one yuan higher than the previous market.

Flour Yesterday's spot transaction was slightly active. Both the North and South Gangs had sporadic embellishments. The local street wholesale also ate the stack list goods into the stomach, but it was also lacking a floating deposit. The market was stable on the ground, and the cost was increasing day by day as the wheat price was rising. It was heard that the pipe shop wheat had reached 10 yuan, 5 cents and 8 points, and people's hearts were looking forward to it. The red and blue cart stack list rose to 7 yuan and 3 corners, and the warship also needed more than 7 yuan and 2 corners. The factory disk still stood at 7 yuan and 2 corners on the original disk, and was temporarily unwilling to open more, so the market may continue to rise. Today, 16,280 packages of flour were transported to Tianjin.

Yesterday's wheat market trend was gradually rising. The recent arrivals are not many, and the sellers are holding on to it, but the factory's stomach is average, and the market has not been able to pass well for a while. The total market was jointly handled by Fuxin and Fufeng factories, with about 600 to 700 packages of Changxi and other wheat, priced at 10 yuan, 1 corner and 2 points, and the hoarders entered a car of pipe shop wheat, priced at 10 yuan, 5 corners and 8 points, and rose several points to nearly a corner.

### Silk and Tea Japanese Silk Rises Madly 125 Yuan

New York Consumption Expected to Improve Factory Through 4,500 Yuan

Yesterday's domestic and foreign silk markets rose sharply. Yokohama spot jumped madly by 125 yuan, deferred rose by 114 yuan, New York spot Japanese silk 83.75 cents each rose by 5 cents, Shanghai silk rose by 5 cents, recent standard silk rose by 1 corner, and deferred rose by 8 cents. The brewing rise in the past ten days has already created a record high yesterday. Looking at the reasons, it is probably caused by the expected improvement in the sales of real silk in New York and the despair of peace in Europe. Therefore, the guiding force of the current market price, which is so high, should be more speculative.

Yesterday's local silk market also rose sharply with it. The white factory rose by 78 yuan and 100 yuan, and the collected miles rose by 60 yuan, totaling 150 dan. As of the afternoon, the price held by silk merchants had risen to 4,500 yuan for the white factory. If the silk sales were not sold, it would be dwarfed in comparison. In recent days, there has been very little news, and there has been no development yet.

### Sugar Market Dutch Sugar Soars

Cart White Follows Up... State Sugar Plummets

According to Dutch telecommunications yesterday, the production price of foreign sugar suddenly rose by 1 yuan and 9 corners, and the price of crude white has reached Dutch shield 12.30, so the association's drawing disk is becoming more and more tense. 24 crude white also rose by 2 yuan and a half to 3 yuan and a half. Our station rose from 56 yuan and a half to 57 yuan and a half. Foreign stations were 57 yuan and a half to 58 yuan, and even reached 59 yuan. Transit goods were 45 or 6 yuan to 46 yuan and 8 corners. Taikoo cart white rose by 2 yuan and a half. B Mike rose from 61 yuan to 62 yuan, CW Mike 60 yuan, CX Mike 60 yuan, DY Mike 58 yuan and a half, HX Mike 58 yuan, H Mike was 41 yuan and a half to 1 yuan and 8 corners, and later reached 42 yuan and a half, and Dutch red was 43 yuan, 1 corner to 3 yuan and a half. This cotton white rose by 3 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 59 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were returned according to the previous price. The original ice rose by 2 yuan and a cow, No. 1 was 70 yuan, and Pin Ming ice was 71 yuan and a half. A tide gang opened out Shanbai powder for state sugar for 53 or 4 yuan to 52 yuan, and Huanggang Qing even entered the 40 yuan mark, only 37 yuan and a half, and the decision was 37 yuan to 36 yuan, which was too far-fetched compared to the previous price.

### Miscellaneous Grains New Sesame Arrives

——Foreign Market's Destination Also Turns Active——

Recently, the source of new sesame has been quite prosperous. At present, the arrivals are around 4,000 yuan. In addition to the export from this street, the sales market also makes a net purchase by foreign markets, which has also become active. (The foreign market's net goods were once opened at 50 tons, priced at 44 yuan), so although the market has softened due to many arrivals, the potential is clear. Yesterday, it was calculated that 200 packages of Yangzhou sesame were traded, priced at 28 yuan, 40 packages of Wuhu sesame were 30 yuan and 2 corners, and 39 packages of Benniu sesame were 26 yuan and 7 corners. The overall situation of soybeans and broad beans is mediocre, and there have been no major changes.

### Hardware Market Disk Soars

Starting yesterday, hardware companies suddenly refused to sell again, and foreign firms also set high prices. The reason is that Germany wants to blockade the sea, and the transportation is hindered by the harassment, and the standards are high. For example, this nail has risen from 46 yuan to 55 yuan, the black iron billet 2,000 pounds has risen from 900 yuan to 1,000 yuan, the black iron billet 200 pounds has risen from 85 yuan to 90 yuan, the company iron has returned from 160 yuan to 170 yuan, the white lead skin has risen from 770 yuan to 800 yuan, the white lead wire has risen from 50 yuan to 60 yuan, the new lead wire has risen from 90 yuan to 110 yuan, the yellow steel wire has risen from 45 yuan to 50 yuan, the flat iron has risen from 40 yuan to 45 yuan, the bamboo steel bar has risen from 750 yuan to 800 yuan, the 20th called the large tinplate has risen from 900 yuan to 1,000 yuan again, the 26th 500 yuan, the front double-connected tinplate 100 pounds, the Italian goods are 230 yuan, the American goods are 240 yuan, the 90-pound double-connected Italian goods are 210 yuan, the American goods are 220 yuan, and the green lead company iron is 155 yuan, all of which have risen rather than fallen compared to before.

### North-South Goods Shima Round Meat Sees New

Because the production price of Shima Yuan meat is high, the customers still lack transportation applications, but the insiders have already transported 4 pieces of goods made by themselves, and it is heard that the price is 20 to 30 yuan higher than that of air-conditioned goods.

### The Japanese and Puppets Occupy the Shelter, Even Expelling Refugees from Their Homes, The Scene of More Than 400 People Sleeping in the Open is Miserable, Puppet Police on Yu Yuan Road Increased Again Yesterday

No. 11, Jiezhu Road, Ji Si Fei Er Road, was originally the club of Hanyeping Coal Mine Company. After the "August 13" incident, it was borrowed by the Cilian Branch to set up the 31st Refugee Shelter. On the afternoon of September 9, it was suddenly invaded by the Japanese and puppet troops and police, occupying the office of the staff downstairs and two large refugee dormitories, and piling up sandbags at the entrance to set up a guard post. A part of the open space in the shelter was also surrounded by iron barbed wire. The refugee shelter and the Nantong Middle School opened another door for entry and exit. Afterwards, the Japanese and puppets continued to occupy two flat houses and opened them as kitchens. However, they usually treated the refugees kindly.

House Word Notice Setting Up a Puppet Tax Bureau

Unexpectedly, on the 1st of this month, the place received a notice from the owner of the house, roughly stating that the house had been transferred to a puppet organization to set up a Unified Tax Bureau, and all of them were required to move out within 15 days. We then expelled them. The refugees were all afraid and apprehensive when they heard the news, and they suddenly showed an uneasy situation. The place had reported the situation to the Cilian Branch, but there was no result so far. Extending to about 2:00 pm the day before yesterday, a Japanese soldier suddenly led more than a dozen puppet policemen and forcibly drove out more than 100 refugees upstairs. Those who disobeyed were whipped on the spot. The refugees were unable to resist, so they had to support the old and carry the young, carrying boxes and baskets, and moved to the outdoor open space to take temporary shelter. It was deep autumn and heavy dew, and they slept in the cold night, and the scene was extremely miserable.

Continue Yesterday to Expel Refugees

Yesterday, the puppet police continued to drive out all the refugees downstairs, and used wooden strips to nail off the doors and windows. It was found that the place originally accommodated more than 650 refugees. After suffering this misfortune yesterday, those who had a little livelihood have left the place one after another. There are still more than 400 people gathering in the open air, but the Japanese and puppet side also limited them to moving out last night. It is heard that Liu Yi, the director of the place, has avoided going to the office after the unfortunate incident occurred. The refugees have repeatedly sent representatives to the Cilian Branch to state their tragic situation and request relief, but there is no result. It is deeply hoped that those who handle charity affairs will be able to do their best in the end.

Increase the Puppet Police Armed Patrolling On Yu Yuan Road, Since a certain agency was established, the Japanese and puppet special agents have long been densely guarded, which is extremely strict. Every intersection has puppet police posts and puppet police directing traffic. Unexpectedly, suddenly starting at 9:00 am yesterday, several small teams of puppet police suddenly increased on the road, and all of them carried guns and armed patrolling back and forth. Each team was divided into six people. The situation was tense and the intention was unclear. It was then learned from the relevant parties that the Japanese and puppet side, because of the assassination of Cheng Haitao, the secretary of the political department of the French Concession police station, also made special preparations for the area along the road where a certain agency is located.

The Puppet Side Sends Personnel to Investigate the Household Registration

Yesterday, the Puppet Police Bureau of West Shanghai sent the puppet officials of the household registration office, each leading two armed puppet police officers, and went to the civic houses in the Da Xi Road area to investigate the population door by door, and inquired in detail about the monthly rent of each house and recorded it in the book. The intention was to prepare to collect the house donation according to the amount of rent of each household. As for other roads, alleys and lanes, they will also carry out the investigation procedures one by one. Once the hand is completed, they will report to the puppet Finance Bureau to start collecting donations. However, the shops and residents in West Shanghai are deeply aware of the righteousness and are determined to resist the puppet side's levy of donations.

### Yesterday Morning - Clear Cannon Fire

From eight o'clock to twelve o'clock yesterday morning, intermittent cannon fire could be heard from the southwestern part of this city. There were more than twenty rounds in total. In the quiet rural areas around Pudong, the sound was quite clear. It is estimated that the location of the cannon fire was twenty to thirty li away from Shanghai, seemingly between Xinlonghua and Minhang. That area is where the Chinese guerrilla forces are active, and they have now joined with the guerrilla forces between Songjiang and Qingpu, posing a significant threat to the Japanese forces in the suburbs of Shanghai.

### French Concession Chief Inspector Cheng Haitao Assassinated - Shot Dead on Route Cardinal Mercier Yesterday Morning - Rickshaw Puller Also Injured by Stray Bullet

Cheng Haitao, the acting Chinese chief inspector of the political affairs department of the French Concession police, was suddenly assassinated by several thugs who opened fire on him en route yesterday morning around seven o'clock. The detailed information obtained is recorded separately below.

Taking a Rickshaw to the Police Station

Yesterday morning at seven o'clock, Cheng got up, ate a bowl of white fungus for breakfast, and took six capsules of cod liver oil. Dressed in a coffee-colored suit, wearing a coffee-colored felt hat, and carrying a pistol, he went to the police station to work. He walked from his residence to the entrance of Hengchang Lane. Because Cheng was usually frugal and did not have vehicles for transportation, he hailed a rickshaw pulled by Gao Xuewen (35 years old, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 3, Lane 780, Route Père Robert), rickshaw number 大照一七一二, 小照七二八九, and sat in it. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw turned into the entrance of Route Cardinal Mercier and headed west, thugs who had been following behind attacked, resulting in the bloodshed.

Thug Attack - Three Shots in the Body

When Cheng's rickshaw reached the entrance of Kangdi Electric Pole Factory at No. 309 Route Cardinal Mercier, four thugs suddenly appeared. Two of them stepped forward to hold the rickshaw canopy and called out, "Mr. Cheng." The rickshaw slowed down slightly. In that instant, one of them pulled out a gun and fired four shots. Because of the close distance, three bullets hit Cheng, in the back of the head, left shoulder, and back. The rickshaw puller, Gao Xuewen, was also hit by a stray bullet, which happened to graze the fleshy tumor on the back of his neck. Blood flowed like a torrent. Both men fell to the ground between No. 309 and No. 311, a halal sesame cake shop. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, scattered and fled without a trace. However, according to another report, a thug suddenly jumped out from behind Cheng's back, from beside a roadside electric pole, rushed to the back of Cheng's rickshaw, and fired four shots at the back of Cheng's head and back. The bullets hit the back of Cheng's head and spine. The rickshaw puller was still unaware and continued to pull the rickshaw forward, while a bullet to Cheng's head pierced his forehead and flew out, grazing the rickshaw puller's right shoulder. He stopped the rickshaw in front of No. 311 Route Cardinal Mercier. Cheng, due to the severity of his injuries, had already died. When the rickshaw stopped and the body fell, the assassin, seeing that his goal had been achieved, turned back and ran wildly eastward to escape.

Death En Route - Sent to Morgue for Examination

A few minutes after the bloodshed, patrol officers from nearby arrived. At the same time, the police station also received the tragic news and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct a major search. They also summoned an ambulance to transport Cheng into the vehicle, intending to take him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but Cheng died en route due to the severity of his injuries, before reaching the hospital. The police station then changed the destination to the Bureau of Public Works morgue on Route Télégraphe. The rickshaw puller, Gao Xuewen, was sent to the hospital for treatment. The police then summoned Cheng's family to the police station to inquire about the situation. Based on intelligence, they requested the First Special Court to send Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang to examine the body. After the examination, the body was released to the family for funeral arrangements.

Acting Chief Inspector - Only Six Months

Cheng was a native of Huizhou, 38 years old. His wife, Liu Shuzhen, was ill and had not yet recovered. They had three sons: Wanli, 18 years old, currently studying at Dagu Vocational School; Qianli (15 years old); and the youngest son, Baili (12 years old), both studying at Chongshi Primary School on Route Père Robert. Cheng also had an elderly father, Fusheng, now 64 years old, a younger brother, Zongtao (17 years old), and a younger sister, Huizhen (16 years old). The family's livelihood depended on his salary. Therefore, when the bad news reached his home, the cries of grief were unbearable. Cheng had been serving in the French Concession police for more than two years. He was originally a secretary and translator in the political affairs department. After the former Chief Inspector Cao Huasheng was killed on May 6 this year, the administration appointed Cheng to his current position because of his competence. Unexpectedly, he suffered a tragic death before serving six months.

No Prior Signs

Cheng's body was moved by his family to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Route Xujiahui yesterday afternoon, and a funeral committee was organized to select a date for the funeral. According to his brother-in-law, Mr. Liu, Cheng's sudden and tragic death came without any prior threatening letters. Therefore, Cheng himself did not take any precautions. The French Concession police are now under strict orders to apprehend the assassins. The recovered bullet casings have also been handed over to experts for examination.

### Detailed Record of Current Ferry Routes After the Shanghai Municipal Ferry Was Seized - It is Incorrect that the Sunken Xin Taikoo No. 9 Was Formerly Ferry No. 6

The Shanghai Municipal Ferry, operated by the former Xingye Trust Company, had a total of six newly built, modern ferry boats, numbered 1 to 6, as well as several streamlined small ferries. They specialized in connecting the east and west banks of the Huangpu River in this city, as well as the waterways to Donggou, Gaoqiao, Wusong, and other places, providing convenience to the citizens and enjoying extremely prosperous business. Unexpectedly, with the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the business was suspended. When the Chinese army withdrew to the west, all the ferries were confiscated by the Japanese army. The Japanese reorganized it into the "Shanghai Ferry Company" and changed the names of the ferries: No. 1 was renamed "Wusong No. 9," No. 2 was renamed "Gaoqiao No. 9," No. 3 was renamed "Chunjiang No. 9," No. 4 was renamed "Qingning No. 9," No. 5 was renamed "Zhejiang No. 9," and No. 6 was renamed "Jiangsu No. 9." The names of the smaller ones are unknown.

Ferry Routes After the Municipal Ferry Was Seized

Except for Nos. 4 and 5, namely Qingning and Zhejiang, which were first returned to the Nisshin Steamship Company for management and operated on the Chongming route, with two round trips per day, docking at Pier No. 1 on the Bund (Yangjingbangkou), they are now, along with the Nisshin Steamship Company, merged into the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. The remaining ferries are managed by the "Shanghai Ferry Company" and still operate to Donggou, Gaoqiao, Wusong, and other places. As for the rumor that the Xin Taikoo No. 9, which capsized outside Wusongkou the day before yesterday (the 16th), was formerly Ferry No. 6, it is completely incorrect. Ferry No. 6 was renamed Jiangsu No. 9 and continues to operate between Donggou and Gaoqiao in this city (docking at Pier No. 14 on the Bund, Renji Wharf).

Xin Taikoo No. 9 Came to Shanghai This Spring

The Xin Taikoo No. 9, which sank the day before yesterday, was indeed owned by the Japanese company Tokitsu. There is also the old Taikoo No. 9 (i.e., Taikoo Nos. 18 and 19), which is now operating normally between Xin'gang and Qianwei. The two ships came to Shanghai this spring and were represented by Nisshin Steamship Company to operate on the Xin'gang-Kou'an (Jingjiang County) route, specifically to seize foreign shipping business. The Xin Taikoo No. 9 ultimately capsized the day before yesterday while returning to Shanghai from Xin'gang, twelve nautical miles from Wusongkou, due to overloading of passengers and cargo. All the details have been recorded in previous reports.

Detailed Record of the Number of Passengers in Distress

After the accident, except for a small number of passengers rescued by Japanese warships and a certain Japanese tugboat, the rest completely sank to the bottom of the sea. Yesterday, it was heard that the Nisshin Steamship Company's Qing Shan No. 9 small boat went to the scene of the accident twice to salvage, but nothing was found. In addition, the ship's hull had completely disappeared. Although various parties are investigating the cause of the accident, all the crew members were killed, so it is impossible to investigate the truth. It is also impossible to estimate the losses. There has been no indication of how to handle the aftermath and salvage issues. According to information obtained yesterday by a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency from the port authorities, the ship carried a total of 469 passengers. The number of rescued people was 80 by the Japanese ship Tachibana No. 9, and 49 by the warship Yixian, for a total of 129 people. The total number of lives lost was 340 people. According to regulations, the ship could carry 100 to 150 passengers. This overloading was the main cause of the disaster.

### Hand Grenades Removed from Empty House on Bazil Road - Japanese Side Has Not Yet Conducted Census in the Area - Residents Often Subjected to Harsh Treatment When Passing Through Gaps

The situation in various sections of Area A, north of Suzhou Creek, remained calm yesterday. The hand grenades found in the empty house at No. 506 Bazil Road were removed yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:

Japanese Side Has Not Yet Conducted Census

Residents in various sections of Area A, north of Suzhou Creek, have not been subjected to a census since the forced vaccination campaign by the Japanese side ended on the 10th of this month. Their movements have also not been restricted, so shops and residents have not yet felt inconvenienced. The situation remains calm. However, there are still many who wish to move to a better place, so rental advertisements are extremely colorful in various alleys.

Jiangsu Motor Transport Company's Wire Mesh Removed

The Jiangsu Motor Transport Company, located at the eastern end of North Jiangxi Road, was originally a British military garrison before the British-Japanese defense line was changed. After the garrison was moved, the empty house was surrounded by a wire mesh frame by the Japanese side. Now, the owner of the house has removed the wire frame and reinstalled the gate. The wire mesh outside the gate had an opening when the British military was stationed, which allowed access to the road. Now, it has been blocked by the Japanese side.

Hand Grenades Removed from Empty House

The former site of the Dahe Southern Goods Store at No. 506 North Bazil Road (western end of North Jiangxi Road) is a north-facing city house located inside the old wire mesh. There are piles of sandbags in the house. After the house number plate was blown down by the wind, the sandbags inside were exposed. A wooden-handled iron hand grenade was found on top of the sandbags. Yesterday afternoon, several workers wearing yellow armbands with the inscription "Property Rental Construction Department" entered the house and removed it, and cleared the old sandbags and rubble.

Residents Often Subjected to Harsh Treatment When Passing Through Gaps

Japanese sentries at the gaps in the wire mesh at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road, Wenzan Shi Road, and Haining Road recently carried rattan whips. Residents who pass through and do not comply are often whipped. The inspection of luggage and miscellaneous items is still strict. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, a scrap metal collector entering Area A from Hongkou was found to have a lot of scrap iron in his baskets. The sentry immediately forced him to hold the baskets with both hands and stand upright at the gap for more than an hour. At the same time, the sentry occasionally poured water from basins on the crowd outside the gap. Although cars and rickshaws are prohibited from passing through, bicycles can still pass.

### French and Polish Women's Relief Work

According to the Continental Times, a meeting was held in the French General Chamber of Commerce on Monday, presided over by Mrs. Gaussmo, wife of the French ambassador. An international committee was established to provide relief to Poles who suffered from the war. Mrs. Gaussmo was not in Shanghai and could not attend, so Mrs. Boussion represented her. The committee's initial work is to collect winter clothing and funds, which will be distributed by the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. The Polish Women's Association of this city is scheduled to hold a paper mahjong tea party at the Western Youth Association on Friday to raise funds to provide relief to Poles who are suffering from the war.

### Three-Cent Streetcar Tickets to Cease Use Tomorrow

The three-cent tickets issued by the Shanghai Tramways Company, which were printed with the dates June, July, and August 1939, were originally scheduled to be used until September 20 to prevent counterfeiting. Later, the company temporarily announced an extension for one month, until the 20th of this month. It is now learned that the expiration date for these tickets is approaching. Apart from being used on streetcars, their circulation in the market has been stagnant.

### Yesterday's Awards Ceremony of the Citizens' Group of the Refugee Association - Chairman Lin Kanghou Reports on Association Affairs - Yu Qiaqing and Others Give Encouraging Speeches

The Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held an awards ceremony at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Association representatives Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiyu, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, as well as fundraising team leaders, adoptive benefactors Zhu Qizhen, Yan Bolin, and others, totaling over 200 people, attended. Chairman Lin Kanghou presided over the ceremony, with Zhang Yichen as the master of ceremonies, and Liu Zhongying and Ge Futian as the general secretaries. Chairman Lin Kanghou first delivered the opening remarks, saying: "Ladies and gentlemen, today our association is holding an awards ceremony. We are very fortunate to have the presence of various benefactors, team leaders, and leaders of the association. There are two purposes for holding this awards ceremony. The first is to thank you for your past support of our association. The second is to hope that you will continue to help us in the future. Our association was established on December 10th last year. As of the end of September this year, we have raised funds to support 16,494 refugees in ten months. The total amount of donations received, including rice, is

Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand

Four Thousand Yuan (detailed figures please refer to the special edition of the conference). Our association's achievements are all thanks to the generous donations of all benefactors and the enthusiastic fundraising of all team leaders. Today, we are holding an awards ceremony. I, on behalf of the refugees, express my deep gratitude to you. The refugee relief work is currently facing a difficult stage again. The biggest reason is the soaring prices. The cost of supplies for refugees has more than doubled compared to the past. Previously, the cost of supplies for each refugee was two yuan per month, but now it has increased to

Five Yuan Per Month

Other medical and administrative expenses have also inevitably increased. At the same time, the cold winter is approaching, and cotton quilts and cotton clothing for refugees must also be prepared in advance. Therefore, the need for relief funds is extremely urgent, and many of the donations previously pledged by various sectors are due to expire at this time. In this difficult stage, the association has therefore made a resolution to continue promoting fundraising work. Recalling this day last year, the association held its inaugural meeting here. Today marks the first anniversary. Since the establishment of the association last year, various sectors have started promoting fundraising work, and they have fulfilled a very

Great Mission

Today, the fundraising committee of the citizens' group is holding another awards ceremony here. I hope that all of you and people from all walks of life present will continue to uphold the spirit of the association when it was first established, continue to support and contribute money and effort, to benefit the victims of the disaster. Finally, I would like to ask the leaders of the association to give us guidance." Subsequently, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, and Tao Leqin delivered encouraging speeches. Finally, Xu Jiyu presided over the awards ceremony. The awards were divided into four types: plaques, framed mirrors, shields, and medals. They were awarded separately according to the amount of donations and fundraising achievements. The situation was very enthusiastic.

### The British China Relief Fund: Report on Two Years of Work (2)

Distribution in China

Funds and supplies were transported to various parts of China with the assistance of British business firms and British expatriates. During the actual distribution of relief goods, there was good cooperation among groups and individuals of various nationalities. In some locations, government officials, Buddhist philanthropists, Christians, Jews from Vienna, and clergy, nurses, and nuns from the United States, France, and Canada worked together with great effort. British mission hospitals were

Most Active in Relief Work

According to news from last year, 37 church hospitals in Central China received 55,900 yuan in six months. Although the funds and supplies were mostly used to provide relief to Chinese refugees, the Central Executive Committee also provided some financial assistance to British expatriates and other foreigners who had been affected by the war, as this was also within the objectives of the fund's initiators. For Chinese refugees, financial aid, food, clothing, and medicine were provided through various relief organizations. The fund also

Assisted Orphans in Sichuan

Financial assistance was also provided for industrial projects to help refugees recover. In the past two years, the fund has directly and indirectly assisted countless men, women, old and young, farmers, and workers affected by the war. The current Central Executive Committee is trying to find the best way to use its funds to meet the remaining great needs. The Taikoo Company recently

Donated Five Thousand Pounds

Enabling the committee to allocate more funds for relief work in Sichuan. After the Tianjin floods, the fund immediately transported a large number of hospital supplies to the area. The subcommittees keep strict accounts of the funds they receive, and the relief agencies provide detailed reports on how the funds are spent. Letters from these agencies and other parties testify to the public's

Great Appreciation

For the work completed by the British Fund. The amounts of funds issued by the fund vary. The Central Executive Committee distributed funds at a meeting in September, with amounts divided into eight categories, the highest being 2,000 pounds and the lowest being 600 yuan. The Central Executive Committee has issued approximately 130,000 pounds in the past two years. Since the committee in London has already spent 40,000 pounds on purchasing medical supplies and other materials, the funds of both the London and Shanghai committees are dwindling. It is deeply hoped that all sectors will continue to donate, and we will be deeply grateful. (End)

### Younger Brother Disregards the Grace of Cultivation - Older Brother Sues for Support - Summons Both Sides' Witnesses, Concludes Trial Awaiting Judgment

Tang Huanru, a native of Dinghai, is currently the director of the parcel section of the Shanghai Postal Administration. He is 41 years old and resides at No. 188 Route Sapey, French Concession. He is currently being sued in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court by his elder brother, Tang Huanxiang (61 years old), represented by attorney Tang Juexian, for disregarding fraternal support and requesting summons and a judgment to provide support. It is claimed that the defendant is the plaintiff's younger brother. In previous decades, the

Family's Circumstances Were Impoverished

In the family, in addition to the parents, there were four brothers and four sisters. The eldest brother was Huanyao, followed by the plaintiff, the third was Huanming, and the fourth was the defendant. Initially, the eldest brother maintained the livelihood of the entire family. Unfortunately, after the eldest brother passed away, the livelihood of the entire family was precarious. The plaintiff came to Shanghai to find a job as a steward on the Zhifu steamship, earning income to maintain the family's livelihood. He also took care of the burials of his grandparents, elder brother's wife, etc., and provided dowries for his sisters, spending thousands of gold. Fortunately, the fourth brother, the defendant, had a higher aptitude. The plaintiff cultivated him with all his strength, from elementary school to middle school, until the age of 22, at the

Cost of Serving in the Post Office

The cost was over three thousand yuan. Moreover, the defendant misappropriated 2,320 Hong Kong dollars that the plaintiff had deposited with the third brother, Huanming, for his marriage. He was treated very well. Now the plaintiff is old, unemployed, and without descendants, unable to make a living, and is on the verge of despair. He has repeatedly begged the defendant for help, but has been repeatedly insulted and rejected, without receiving a single cent. However, the plaintiff was unable to accumulate savings due to educating the defendant, so he could not provide for his old age. Now the defendant has a monthly salary of four yuan [Note: original text appears incomplete], and over the years has

Accumulated Tens of Thousands in Savings

Sitting idly by while the plaintiff starves, he requests that the defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiff 1,800 yuan in support each year, for a period of five years, etc. Based on the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Yu Changzi, summoned the plaintiff and his lawyer to court yesterday afternoon to state the situation. The defendant was represented by a lawyer. After the court summoned witnesses from both sides, it announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the judgment for the 25th.

### Trafficking in Women from Good Families - Forcing Prostitution - Ma Shao and Others Awaiting Judgment

Ma Shao, a woman from Changshu, used to run a brothel in Beiping. When she recently returned to her hometown, she saw that Qu Xushi's 19-year-old daughter, Qu Renbao, was somewhat attractive, and had evil intentions. She used sweet words to persuade Qu Xushi, willing to take her daughter to Shanghai to find a job. Qu trusted her and entrusted her daughter to Ma Shao.

Bringing Her to Shanghai, after arriving in Shanghai, Ma colluded with Zhang Shuigen, Wu Rongbao, and Chen Tan, all from Suzhou, and on the 6th of last month, sold the woman to Fu Lao Si, who ran a brothel, for 400 yuan. On the one hand, Ma returned to Changshu and told Qu Xushi that her daughter was missing after arriving in Shanghai. Qu then followed her to Shanghai the day before yesterday to search, but somehow a dispute arose on Avenue Édouard VII. The police investigated and brought them to the Old Gate Police Station, where Western Chief Detective Fang Teer, Chinese Detective Guo Ruiquan, and Detective Zhou Wenqing, after investigation, Ma Shao began to

Confess the truth. The detectives arrested Zhang Shuigen, Wu Rongbao, and Chen Tan at No. 34, Lane 726, Fuzhou Road, and No. 541, Route Cardinal Mercier, and rescued Qu Renbao. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for trafficking in women from good families and forcing them into prostitution. He also stated that the woman had been working as a prostitute for more than 20 days. When questioned, each defendant made evasive statements and hired attorney Tang Youwei to defend them. Judge Feng Shide, after verifying the confessions, ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.

### Fashion Industry Colleagues: Labor Unrest Expands

Hua Da's Planned Resumption of Work Sabotaged

Following the outbreak of a labor strike in the women's wear industry on Fourth Avenue, and after mediation by the Western Clothing Industry Guild, the dispute remained unresolved due to significant discrepancies in demands.

### Landlords of Cide Lane on Zhejiang Road Request Rent Increase Again

The houses in Cide Lane on Zhejiang Road belong to the Hardoon estate. This spring, the rental management office issued a notice to increase rents, resulting in a 30% increase. Recently, the Hardoon rental management office sent letters to the tenants again, stating that due to the sharp decline in exchange rates and increased repair costs, it was necessary to readjust rental prices. Tenants were instructed to go to the office to renegotiate the rent within ten days of receiving the letter, otherwise they would be required to move out next month. Tenants learned from the rental management office that the notice of this decision was indeed intended to continue increasing rents, and the amount of the increase was significant. Furthermore, a large tip was required. Therefore, the tenants jointly engaged lawyer Huang Xiubo to take appropriate legal action to prevent the rental management office from increasing the burden on tenants again during this extraordinary period.

### Fake "Court" in Western Shanghai Solicits Lawsuits

Business Has Been Very Slow for a Week

The fake "Local Branch Court" established in western Shanghai by the fake "Judicial Department of the Reformed Government" has been in preparation for a long time. Due to insufficient funds, it almost failed to materialize. Later, the "President" of the court, Lu Qi, repeatedly tried to raise funds and finally managed to establish it reluctantly. However, since its establishment, there have been no lawsuits to handle. To cope with the situation, the "court" actually put up a "notice" to solicit lawsuits. According to a reporter from the China News Agency, the notice was posted on the 13th and has been up for a week as of yesterday. Not only has no one inquired, but business has been very slow. The fake officials in the "court" sit idle all day with nothing to do.

### Letters to the Editor

To the esteemed editor,

I have just read in the local news section of your newspaper on October 17th about the launching of the Movement to Promote Honesty and Integrity in this city by various sectors, and the organization of a committee, with my humble name listed as a member, which I find extremely astonishing. Since the Shanghai war, I have suffered great losses and have become utterly discouraged. At a time when the cost of living is soaring and it is difficult to make a living, I can barely secure a stable life, let alone have the energy to participate in group meetings. Moreover, propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four pillars of our country, and the emphasis should be on practical action, not on superficial reporting in newspapers. My conduct in life is based on honesty and trustworthiness. Since I have not participated in this meeting, I must write to request a correction in order to clarify the matter. I would be grateful if you could publish this. With best wishes,

Sincerely,

Luo Ziqiang, October 18th

To the esteemed editor,

I was dismayed to see my humble name listed on the list of members of the Movement to Promote Honesty and Integrity Committee in yesterday's newspaper. Since the August 13th incident, I have not been participating in any associations due to their complexity and unclear aims. I have been staying at home reading books. Fearing that this may cause trouble in the future, I respectfully request a correction. Please accept my regards.

Sincerely,

Yan Xingsan, October 18th

### Remembering Mr. Lu Xun

— Shi Guang

Three years have passed since the death of our great literary master, Mr. Lu Xun. He was a mentor to young people all over China and even the world, a revolutionary realist writer. His lifelong struggle was for the liberation and reform of the nation and society, and for all of humanity.

Using his supreme artistic skills, he wrote many essays, prose, and novels, exposing the corruption and darkness of society and pointing out a bright path for the masses to follow.

Mr. Lu Xun's life was a battle against hypocrisy, treachery, and ugliness, and against cowardly opportunists and traitors. He was the Chinese Gorky, leading many national revolutionary mass writers. He participated in the unified national war effort. In 1935, he organized an anti-fascist group, giving a strong rebuke to barbarous fascism!

"A writer, of course, needs the necessary skills, but even more, he needs a progressive consciousness and a lofty human dignity... We need those writers who can serve as pioneers and guides." This is what Mr. Lu Xun said. He himself was such a practitioner. He stood at the forefront of humanity in China and the world. He was not a hypocrite, he did not let go of his enemies. Although he was persecuted, attacked, slandered, and threatened, he remained active and bravely moved forward.

He was indeed a comrade of the oppressed classes and oppressed nations, a model revolutionary writer of the new era. His great personality and great works of art are truly models for the masses. We should learn from him.

His uncompromising fighting spirit and love for humanity will forever be preserved in the hearts of all people in China and the world. Although he died three years ago, his art and spirit will live forever in the world, generation after generation, and will never disappear!

Mr. Lu Xun must be smiling and resting peacefully in the earth, because the sons and daughters of China are now working hard on the front lines and in the rear for this great national liberation war.

### Run Aground

— Le Huan

——War Zone Notes from the Beijing-Shanghai Line——

Night, an October night.

The sky was without a crescent moon, and no blinking stars; it was a pitch black.

Continuous autumn rain had turned the road into mud. Car tracks were carved into the road surface: a car was trudging along the tracks carrying two thousand cotton vests and nineteen comrades.

With great difficulty, one wheel climbed out of the mud, but another sank in. No matter how fast the wheels turned, the car refused to move. The car body shook like a steamer in rough seas. The comrades all lay on the cotton vests.

In the hazy light, it felt like the car body was shaking particularly violently. The driver said it was stuck too deep, and we had to lighten the load.

Rubbing away the sleepiness, with a mumbling tone, each person groped in the dark for their shoes and climbed out of the car. The mud covered our shoes as soon as we stepped out. But no one regretted getting their leather shoes dirty; we felt only happiness, like we had returned to our childhood, and we perked up.

We hurried to find some straw by the side of the road and spread a large piece of it out. We moved the cotton vests out of the car compartment one by one, hoping that the car could jump out of the deep pit before all the vests were moved. But we only heard the engine roar heavily, and the mud still held the four wheels stuck. Until the last vest left the car compartment, it still stood there motionless.

We began to get anxious. If we couldn't get out of this deep pit, it wouldn't be safe to be in this place near the front line after dawn.

"It's time to exert our strength!" A loud voice rang out from among the comrades, followed by the sound of mud and shoes stirring. The comrades quickly distributed themselves behind and to the sides of the car.

"Everyone push together... Hai yo hum..."

More than twenty arms supported the car body; the driver accelerated the engine, the wheels moved forward slightly, pursuing new hope, and each person added more strength to their arms.

"Everyone work hard, push forward together, everyone...

Push out of the mud pit in front..."

The song boosted the strength of our arms. Finally, with a "crack" sound, the car broke free from the pit and drove into another shallower track. New hope came, and laughter broke through the silent darkness.

We packed the vests more energetically, took off our muddy shoes, and climbed back into the car. In the intermittent vibration of the engine, the truck slowly crawled like a camel in the desert. The car compartment once again emitted a satisfied laugh, and fatigue no longer attacked anyone.

However, because the road had not been easily repaired, the damage was too severe. The car was soon blocked again by a small stream, and the car tilted to one side.

The comrades' laughter stopped with this blow. Putting on our wet shoes, we stepped out of the car and inspected it. We felt that it was not enough to rely on the strength of our dozen or so people. Looking at the watch by the light of the flashlight, there was still a considerable time before dawn, and we felt more relaxed. Leaving the driver to guard the vehicle, we, led by a comrade familiar with the local situation, groped in the dark to the house of the nearby village chief.

Out of necessity, we had to knock on the door of the village chief's house. The one who opened the door was the village chief, around forty years old. We explained our intentions very politely and expressed our sincere apologies.

"This is a matter of the country, and we ordinary people should do our part. You must be tired. Rest for a while and let me call a few strong men to help you. They are familiar with this kind of thing. This is not the first time." While saying this, he lit a lantern and hurriedly went out.

The comrades' hearts were even more active.

In a moment, the village chief led a dozen young strong men, carrying various tools, and carrying bamboo poles and wooden boards. We went to meet them, and everyone went back to the road.

Along the way, we didn't hear a single complaint. They had all been awakened from their sweet dreams.

With skilled techniques and collective strength, without reducing the car's load, the car was pushed onto the right road. The comrades were indescribably grateful to these strong men. There were no hypocritical pleasantries, only sincere gratitude on their faces.

Finally, the village chief told us that the roadbed ahead was much stronger. We thanked the village chief and the dozen young men, got into the car, and disappeared into the darkness, leaving behind a dozen kind and honest faces.

The east revealed a faint dawn, and we continued on our journey.

Commemorating Comrade Shen Keding with Action

### Mountain Spirit

— Ding Di

Sealing off a realm of quiet, fallen leaves slowly piled up thickly in the deep autumn, and no one walked through, bringing a bit of the city's mud to dye it. If many trees were planted on this mountain, it would naturally be even more gloomy, with branches and vines intertwined, forming an umbrella, blocking sunlight and wind, and the cool shade under the trees would be a good place to escape the summer heat. Even in heavy rain, not much would leak through. However, I never liked these things. I can't help but think of those leaves that are too thick and too dense. You say, the branches and leaves are tangled together, and it's hard to tell which is on whose tree, how dark the light must be. It feels like my heart is wrapped in a piece of black gauze, with terror, restlessness, also symbolizing a shadow in front of me. In the overly quiet air, even the faint breathing of a crow standing upright on a tree with its claws can be heard. The sound of a bell rang out from somewhere, making the dark mountain so trembling, like a winding and shining ribbon pulling a heart towards the heights and far away, flickering a few times in the air, and then it became dark again, and as a result, this ribbon was naturally broken.

Broken… So, do you feel a burst of emptiness in your heart, with gloominess pressing down and darkness surrounding you? Do you feel that this mountain really has a majestic, sad life? In the dark valleys at dusk, you can taste the trembling of life in the stillness. You succumb to nature and marvel at their mysteries. Perhaps you have left the familiar face of the mountain, you have had a long friendship, you know every tree, every stone, every flower on the mountain. Your understanding is absolutely different from others, you have another face in your mind, they become your flowers, your stones, your bridges, your friends. Therefore, you have made an alliance with the fish, gulls, and birds, so a mountain does not look serious in your eyes but is amiable. You should say that the mountain spirit is not a terrifying but a lovely friend… Alas, there are really too many mountains, where you and I are afraid of having mountains? "At first glance, there is no disgust, only Mount Jingting", who does not have a lovely mountain that evokes their own emotions in the midst of war? You can't help but think about their mornings and evenings, when the morning sun rises, when the sunset glows brilliantly, when the mountain mist is hazy, when the smoke and rain cover the ridge, when the sunset reflects, …

You are concerned about them but do not pity them. The mountain spirit is not like a small object to be caressed, it contains a majestic body, a proud momentum, and a healthy physique. On sunny days, it is the first to be covered by the high sun, and on cloudy days, it is covered with a thick layer of smoky fog. It is bright during the day and gloomy at night. As long as you have a hometown with mountains, you will love that mountain. If you can go for a few visits every year, you will know that mountain is not just a mountain, there is an unnamed mountain spirit, you can distinguish the declarations of those flowers, grasses, rocks, trees and hermitages, and you can use a heart to taste their thousands of different emotions.

When they are haggard, they also explain your depression. Does your hometown have mountains? Are the mountains still the same? ………… Of course, I can't help but miss a mountainous city. The Dangxiu River tells the wisdom of the people, and the simplicity of the mountains teaches the people simplicity. The mountains near the river are open, the mountains on the sandbar are sparse, and the mountains on the island are misty, they explain many different personalities. When I was young, I knew their tranquility, and after the turmoil, I saw their depression again. Six or seven months of time have made the mountain spirit haggard, but hardship has also made it more resilient. The mountain is a bit old, but the sound of the waves seems to be stronger than before.

People who live in their hometown have also seen your home mountains? What does the mountain spirit look like? Is it more haggard? Is it more angry? You know the heart of the mountain. You know the anger of the mountain spirit, you know the black of the mountains, the green of the maple forest, you also know how to understand the life of the mountain with loftiness, majesty and solidity. You will never just make old dreams, you will also accompany it to be angry, accompany it to avenge. Although it is sealed off with a piece of quiet, the center is full of volcanic flames, this is the roar of the mountain spirit and yours, which is more touching than your nostalgia.

### Pursuit

— Lai Hong

——Dedicated to Jin Chun

On the giant waves of the ocean,

You have to wash away that dirty memory;

Breaking through the twilight of the previous night,

You will see

The seagulls' brave pursuit.

Pursuit!

Pursuit!

Regardless of

People making fun of it like this;

You stick to your inherent goal,

Like seagulls that eventually fly to the stern of the ship!

### About Children's Theater: "Little Five Righteous Ones" to be Performed Soon

— Ya Erbei

——Collective Creation by the China Drama Association

It is indeed not easy to engage in children's drama. Its plot, meaning, dialogue, and actions all have their unique aspects. The plot must be as clear as a sunny day, with the sound of gurgling springs, the lively meaning of myths, straightforward morals, simple dialogue, and musicalized actions complemented by imaginative, patterned sets. Moreover, the entire scene must be filled with a thriving and lively atmosphere, unfolding an optimistic path, and instilling a spirit of self-improvement in children's minds.

It is very inappropriate to use ordinary adult scripts as children's plays. Children's plays must be created with children as the target audience, and the playwright must also possess a naive mind and a thorough understanding of children's psychology, so that the realm he writes about is the realm of children.

Children are not suitable for watching tragedies, because their pure hearts, untouched by dust, have not yet experienced the vicissitudes of life like adults. It is best to have farces and comedies, with meaningful humor and implicit joy, so that they reach the realm of "truth, goodness, and beauty."

It is recently heard that the China Drama Research Association is collectively creating several children's plays, preparing them for performance by children's drama groups. In the barren field of Chinese children's drama, this news is indeed a promising new seedling. It is heard that the second performance of the association at the Xindu Sunday Children's Theater will be the children's play "Little Five Righteous Ones," written by Ouyang Huan through collective creation.

### Mei Lanfang's Private Life (5)

— Li Feishu

— Sixth of Miscellaneous Reminiscences by the Plum Blossoms

Daily Life

Mr. Mei's life is also very simple. He gets up around nine o'clock every day (except when staying up late when performing). He usually does not have a morning snack. After washing up, he goes to his study to read newspapers and incoming mail, and writes a few large characters. Lunch is at twelve o'clock, with no more than four meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and one soup. He does not indulge in extravagance. Regardless of delicacies or coarse food, he always finishes two bowls of rice. Spicy food is detrimental to his voice, so he avoids it. Otherwise, he does not pick and choose his food. There is a special delicacy in Lingnan called "He Chong" (paddy worms), which look like shelled snails, about an inch long, kept in crystal cups, with mottled colors. The Cantonese people eat them alive. Mr. Mei also likes them, and finds them as sweet as sugar. (Note: He Chong are produced in the paddy fields near the coast of Guangdong. According to the "Guangdong New Language," some can grow up to ten feet long. They have mouths at each segment, and are green when raw, and red-yellow when cooked. In summer and autumn, when the early and late rice matures, so do the worms. When the tide rises and floods the fields, they break off and come out with the tide, floating during the day and sinking at night. When they float, the surface of the water turns purple. Their strange shape is daunting at first sight, let alone eating them alive!) After lunch, he studies plum blossom painting with Mr. Tang Dizhi. He learns English from an English teacher every day. After finishing his lessons, he socializes with visiting friends, or handles matters at this time in an orderly manner. In the evening, he mostly attends banquets with friends. Occasionally, he gathers with two or three close friends in a small market building, not drinking alcohol, or drinking only to a light buzz. After dinner, he likes to watch movies. When he enters the theater, he always waits until the lights are turned off, otherwise the audience's gazes will all be focused on him. There are those who come forward to express their admiration, and those who ask for autographs. It truly becomes like being on Shanyin Road, where one is overwhelmed with greetings! After returning from watching the movie, he listens to wireless radio, which has become his only hobby and his best companion in his lonely life, seeking spiritual comfort. He likes to receive foreign music, especially German Opera. After hearing a pleasant piece of music, he can stay up all night, unaware of the dawn.

### Another Buddhist Film Coming: Xinhua Plans to Film "Sakyamuni"

— Yin Di

Yi Hua Company is preparing to bring "Guan Shi Yin" to the screen, which is the first sign of the birth of Buddhist films. But as far as the reporter knows, Xinhua Film Studio is also planning to film "Sakyamuni" at the same time. First, because the background of "Sakyamuni" is India, in addition to all the Indian buildings in the film, dozens of elephants are also needed, so the exterior scenes are prepared to be taken in India. Second, if possible, "Sakyamuni" is prepared to be filmed using three-color film. If financial resources can be arranged, then perhaps several experts will be hired from the United States to come to Shanghai to serve as consultants.

Due to the above two points, the production of "Sakyamuni" will become an astonishing figure in terms of money consumption. Now, the script story is being written by playwright Zhou Yibai. After it is written, it still needs to be divided into scenes, so it will probably take a considerable period of time before filming starts, but the exterior photography team is already being prepared and organized, and may set off next month.

The director of this film has been decided to be Fang Peilin, who is also in charge of the set design. The cinematographer is Xue Boqing, and the male and female leads are Mei Xi and Chen Yunshang.

Charlie Chaplin's lover, Paulette Goddard, tries on new clothes for the first time, and her posture is even more beautiful. Her most recent film is "The Cat and the Canary."

### Memories of Old Shisan Dan

— Shi Wei Xuan

The last time Old Shisan Dan came to Shanghai was about twenty years ago. I don't remember the exact date, but the performance venue was definitely at the Danggui First Stage on Fourth Road. There was a square electric pole standing on the roof, with the words "Genuine Old Shisan Dan" written on it. On a certain Sunday day show, the full version of "New An Post" was performed, and "Cutting Down Zidu" was performed at night. I once watched both the day and night shows at the invitation of a friend. "New An Post" was originally created by Hou Ling. Although he was nearly sixty years old at the time, his stability in the stilt work and the appropriateness of his expressions were definitely beyond the reach of his successors. When the performance reached the bridal chamber, some guests got up and left. Suddenly, Xu Shaoqing, the stage manager, was seen standing at the door, shouting loudly: "The Shanghai people are not qualified after all! Such a good show, leaving without watching it to the end, I'm afraid you won't have the chance to hear it again in this lifetime." So the guests sat down again, and only two or three of those who had left returned. At night, he cross-dressed and played "Cutting Down Zidu." It can be said that a Dan role being able to perform this play is unprecedented and unrepeatable. It is a masterpiece that is not easy to perform lightly and rarely seen. When he started fighting with a spear, he completely got rid of the air of a Dan role, and his martial arts skills were very proficient. By the time it came to the scene in the Golden Palace, his state of madness was intense but not fiery. Every move was in perfect synchronization with the drumbeats, and the applause followed accordingly. The final posture of pouncing on the tiger was particularly miraculous and clean, making people clap their hands and shout in amazement. The entire audience almost felt as if they were on the scene, and their minds were captivated. Even now, when I occasionally talk about it with friends, I can't help but gesticulate and dance, regretting that I can't see it again. From this, it can be seen that the old performers have real skills, unlike the recent performers who only dazzle people with their appearance, which is not worth mentioning.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Extra Member of the Board of Revenue, Expectant Intendant of a Circuit

However, his colleagues respected his character and admired his outstanding abilities, so although everyone felt that his Intendant-style attire was unsophisticated, they did not dare to mock him with a mocking tone. As a result, he gained the nickname "Li Yuanwai" (Li the Esquire). In principle, "Yuanwai" is the title of a wealthy landlord in the countryside. The reason why Li Laogongfeng got this nickname was not because he had money or land, but simply because his attire resembled that of a "Yuanwai."

Among the famous actors of ancient and modern times, Old Tan had the grandest style. His diet, daily life, and all the equipment in his home were extremely exquisite. Even the clothes he wore in private were imitated as much as possible from those of Beizi (imperial sons) and Beile (imperial grandsons). His clothes were all arranged according to a fixed number and order of cotton and fur-lined clothes, changing every day. He wore white socks, Yun shoes, a satin robe, a woolen vest, and a melon-skin cap with pearls and gems. He held a snuff bottle in his hand, and a sachet and jade pendant were tied to his waist. When he went out, he sat in a sedan chair with a double-bridged frame. He really looked the part. At the same time, his residence was frequented by high officials, dignitaries, Beizi, and Beile. His colleagues saw his extravagant behavior, which resembled the style of a Beizi and Beile, so the title "Tan Beile" spread throughout the nine cities.

Because Juxian Daoren came from a non-professional background, he tried his best to avoid the habits of actors. Usually, most people in the Pear Garden do not grow beards, and it is even rarer to see people wearing glasses on weekdays. But Juxian was different. Whenever he was resting or not being summoned, he would grow a beard. (In my book "Pear Garden Shadows," there are three photos of famous actors. Excluding the scenes and non-professional performers, he is the only one who wears a beard in casual clothes. Moreover, both the photos at fifty-eight and eighty-eight years old have beards. Photos of him without a beard have never been seen outside.) He wore dark glasses on his nose, silk boots, a sable hat, and a leather coat. He looked dignified and upright. If you didn't know in advance that he was an amateur turned professional actor, you would simply take him for an expectant Intendant of a Circuit. And that's how he got the nickname "Expectant Intendant of a Circuit." One (122)
