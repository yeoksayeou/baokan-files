Fifth Plenary Session Issues Declaration

### Future Endeavors Key to Determining Survival and Prosperity: Strengthen Unity, Strive to Implement Strategies for Later Stages of the War of Resistance, Pay Attention to Elevating National Spirit, Rectify Revolutionary Discipline, Japan's Violent Behavior Will Inevitably Lead It Into an Unrecoverable Abyss

(Chongqing) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee issued a declaration at its closing ceremony.

The full text is as follows:

Since the Provisional National Congress in April of last year, our Party, based on the resolutions of the Congress and the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction, has led the people of the whole country in continuing to strive for the sacred war of resistance, while simultaneously carrying out the work of national reconstruction amidst the war of resistance. Over the past ten months, the military and the people have been of one heart and mind, and their will has become even stronger. Although the war zones have shifted, the foundation of the nation has become more solid. Since the loss of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the situation of the war of resistance has shifted from the early stage to the later stage. The main purpose of the early stage of the war of resistance was to exhaust the enemy's strength, expose the enemy's conspiracy, and complete the strategy and deployment for the later stage of the war of resistance. The task of the later stage of the war of resistance is to inherit the achievements of the early stage of the struggle and to unleash all anti-Japanese forces in the front and rear and in the occupied areas in order to achieve final victory and the success of national reconstruction. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is appropriately held today at the beginning of the later stage of the war of resistance. Recalling the war record of the past eighteen months, and the glorious sacrifices and contributions of our national soldiers and people, we deeply feel that the struggle that follows is the key to determining the survival and prosperity of our nation. We must conduct a detailed review of internal and external affairs, establish a strategy for the later stage of the war of resistance, and strive to implement it. Here, we present the key points to our comrades in the Party and to our compatriots across the nation, and sincerely report them. In the past ten months of the war of resistance, the enemy's invasion has become deeper, its military strength has been more depleted, and the crisis in its finances, economy, and society has become more serious. From the Battle of Southern Shandong to the battles on both sides of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, enemy casualties have increased by more than 500,000, and war expenses have increased to more than 900 million. Domestic political struggles have arisen repeatedly, and infighting has intensified. In the past few months, the enemy has issued its so-called "establishment of a new order in East Asia" declaration, hoping to use this fallacy to cover up its brutality. However, all countries in the world have seen through this hidden intention. The purpose of our sacred war of resistance is to seek national independence and national survival. Although we have lost a wide territory and suffered many casualties, the spirit of our national soldiers and people to fight the enemy with a common hatred has become more invigorated. Everyone is determined to die in order to build an eternal cause for the nation. Our country has always been a nation that loves peace. The reason why we are enduring a long war with perseverance and not hesitating to make any sacrifices is the result of the Japanese militarists' continuous use of force to invade, their wanton nibbling and swallowing, and their forcing us into a final impasse. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has brazenly disregarded everything, destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations, and carried out the occupation of our four northeastern provinces. On July 7th of the previous year, it further displayed its tyranny by attacking Lugouqiao and occupying Beiping and Tianjin. The lifeline and destiny of our nation had reached a point of survival or extinction. The entire nation, from top to bottom, could no longer endure it. Therefore, although we knew that our military equipment and weaponry were inferior to the enemy's, in order to maintain the survival of our nation, we had no choice but to engage in a difficult and tragic war of resistance. If there is still a glimmer of hope for peace, we will never give up on peace. If the sacrifice has reached the final moment, we will certainly sacrifice. This is the determination that our Party's Commander-in-Chief has repeatedly stated, and it is also the national policy that our people unanimously adhere to. The ambition of the Japanese militarists to annex the mainland is, externally, the common enemy of the world, and internally, hated by the people. Looking at the years since the September 18th Incident, three of their prime ministers have been assassinated, two finance ministers have been assassinated, four or five admirals and generals have been assassinated, more than one hundred university professors have been arrested and imprisoned, and countless people have been imprisoned for opposing the war. The unity they maintain today is merely a manifestation of the militarists' tyranny. There is an ancient saying that, "When two armies meet, the one that grieves will win." The grief and indignation of our national compatriots in resisting aggression and the upright spirit of maintaining peace are sufficient to be the main force in overcoming the enemy. At the beginning of this later stage of the war of resistance, the most important thing for our compatriots across the nation is to jointly and consistently adhere to the meaning of the struggle. The declaration of the Provisional National Congress stated, "What we seek is a just peace, not a peace of surrender. Surrender will only encourage the arrogance of the aggressor. If China is frightened by Japan's violence and surrenders, seeking temporary security, then it will be reduced to a Japanese colony. The nation will lose its independent existence, and the freedom and equality of the country will be unattainable." As for the National Provisional Congress after the war of resistance, it even more clearly pointed out that in order to establish the integrity of the national territory and administration, and to realize a country of equality and freedom, we will never stop until our goal is achieved. Our Premier created the Three Principles of the People for revolution and national salvation, led the people to revive China and establish the Republic, to strive for national independence, to strive for national survival, to seek permanent peace in East Asia, and to establish a dignified example of righteousness for the world. The meaning of today's war of resistance is also the same. Japanese civilization initially sought it from Korea, and then learned it from our country. Everything from food, clothing, housing, and transportation to the principles of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, there is nothing that we have not given. Our country has been known for its prosperity and strength in East Asia for thousands of years, while Japan's strength has only been for several decades. Korea was destroyed by it long ago, and now it is further attempting to annex our China. Looking at the words of their militarists, they want to dominate the globe and conquer Europe and America. Their withdrawal from the League of Nations and tearing up the Nine-Power Treaty are only the beginning of their unleashing of violence on the world. The reason why our country is resolutely resisting today is not only to resist the enemy that is invading our country and to restore our sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity, but also to punish the ringleader who destroys the dignity of treaties and endangers world peace. We earnestly hope that the peace-loving friends in the world will promote the spirit of unity and maintain the jointly beneficial treaties, implement effective methods, and eliminate the spread of war. Only in this way can we achieve peace for the people of the world and increase the happiness of mankind. This is the common understanding and unwavering determination of our 450 million people. Looking at the evolution of the international situation in the past year, it is quite similar to the eve of the European war in the past, and the depth and breadth of the crisis is far from comparable to the European war. Even taking the situation since the start of the war of aggression by Japan against China as an example, it has used its air force to bomb undefended cities, strafe civilians who are not combatants, and burn cultural buildings in cities and villages. The scenes of its cruelty and ferocity are not found in the European war. All countries, governments, and people in the world who love peace and uphold justice feel the same urgent response. In the past few years, those who only wanted to appeal with words and reaffirm the effectiveness of international law to stop the spread of war have now changed their approach and are simultaneously seeking to use their strength to create guarantees for self-defense and joint defense. As of today, no matter who it is, it is clear that Japan's invasion of China is the beginning of threatening the world's largest market between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Last autumn, the enemy forces invaded Wuhan and advanced to Guangzhou, blockading the two major rivers of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. The League of Nations happened to be meeting at this time. Allied countries such as Britain, France, and Soviet Russia righteously exerted their efforts and unanimously supported the application of sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant to Japan's aggression. The League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution on January 19th recently invited countries concerned with the Far Eastern situation to consult with each other in order to take effective measures to provide assistance to our country. At the same time, U.S. President Roosevelt firmly upheld the Nine-Power Treaty and issued a firm warning to the brutal Japan. Britain and France followed suit and jointly maintained the treaty. The purpose of this is not only to stop the brutal Japan's aggression but also to eliminate all the tragedies that destroy world peace. Our country, at a time of hardship, deeply appreciates and will never forget this noble friendship of supporting those in danger. We are also confident that our Chinese nation will contribute its utmost sincerity in upholding justice and righteousness to the future of human civilization and world peace, and will certainly live up to the expectations of our friendly countries. We are even more convinced that our Republic of China has the essence to eliminate world wars and promote a peaceful life for humanity. When the European war had just ended, the countries involved in the great war were suffering from a lack of solutions for the aftermath. Our Premier then published his great plan to develop China's industries and believed that only this great plan could fulfill the international peace advocated by President Wilson at that time, eliminate the causes of international wars caused by the post-war countries following the old path of commercial war, and save the country and the people.

Editorial

### The Spanish War and the European Crisis

Since the Italian-German fascists and the Spanish Nationalist forces jointly captured Barcelona, the Spanish resistance has entered a more serious and difficult stage. However, the Spanish war has not ended as Mussolini and his ilk had hoped ("it can be declared over immediately"), not only has it not ended, but the Spanish government forces are still determined to fight to the end, having established a new defense line to hold out against the fascist invading forces for a long time, so that the invaders will never be able to conquer Spain. This assertion is based on the following three points:

First, the Spanish government forces still possess elite main forces and have not been weakened by the fall of Barcelona. The Spanish government forces' abandonment of Barcelona was clearly a "strategic retreat," a withdrawal without a decisive battle. Therefore, Spain still possesses 500,000 elite main force troops.

Second, the Spanish government still controls more than one-third of the country's vast territory, which can serve as a base for continuing the resistance. The fall of Barcelona will not deal it a fatal blow. As Aguirre, the president of the Basque Autonomous Government, rightly said: "Based on our thirty months of experience, we know that the victory or defeat of a war cannot be determined by the gain or loss of a single city. We are fighting for fundamental principles, and we will continue to fight until we achieve final victory!"

Third, the Spanish resistance is not only its own problem but also a matter of European and even world peace. Therefore, it has the support of justice-loving people all over the world. Today, the call to "aid Spain" has resounded in every corner of the world. This torrent of sympathy from the people of the world will inevitably converge into a huge force of assistance one day.

From the above narrative, it can be seen that although the Spanish resistance has become increasingly difficult due to the fall of Barcelona, it still possesses the conditions for achieving final victory. Naturally, on the other hand, the fall of Barcelona will inevitably have a serious impact on the European situation, and this impact is already evident in fact:

First of all, the fall of Barcelona not only struck a blow to the Spanish government but also threatened France and Britain's hegemony in the Mediterranean. Barcelona is located on the south side of the Pyrenees, close to the French border, and the threat to French security is undoubtedly great. Moreover, Italy will inevitably take advantage of its position in Spain to intensify its pressure on France, which France has already keenly felt.

Secondly, the fall of Barcelona will inevitably further fuel the arrogance of the Berlin-Rome axis. Hitler has decided on a new expansion plan and is about to deliver a speech. According to the Associated Press, he will not only demand the return of colonies but also demand 200 billion pounds in reparations. As of the time this manuscript was sent to print, Hitler's speech had not yet been received, but London and Paris are eagerly awaiting his speech.

In short, the more fascist forces advance in Spain, the more precarious the situation in Europe becomes. The current situation in Europe is changing around the Spanish war. We must not deny that Spain has reached a critical juncture today. But it is not too late for the British and French authorities to suddenly change their course, abandon the illegal "non-intervention" policy, and give Spain active assistance to save the critical situation!

However, after reading the speeches of French Foreign Minister Bonnet and British Prime Minister Chamberlain, it is known that these two countries still have no intention of abandoning the "non-intervention" policy. Chamberlain even indicated that he would continue his appeasement policy of condoning aggression, which will only promote war.

Recently, Mussolini, seeing the bleak prospects of the Spanish war, proposed convening a new Munich conference to resolve the Spanish problem. The Munich Conference sacrificed Czechoslovakia in one fell swoop, opening the way for the Nazis to advance eastward. Now, Italian fascists are jealous and want to hold a new "Munich" to destroy Spain, strike at France, Britain, and even the gathering point of world democratic forces. Will Chamberlain, who has consistently worked to "appease," direct this again?

A new Munich conference may or may not be convened; this depends on Spain itself. Spain is different from Czechoslovakia; Spain is firmly resisting. Its answer will be resistance, resistance, resistance to the last person!

The people of the world have recognized that the struggle of the Spanish people is a struggle of peace and progress against fascism. The future of Europe will be determined by the duel at the foot of the Pyrenees. Peace-loving people all over the world must rise up, break through the shackles of "non-intervention," and shatter the "appeasement" policy of condoning aggression, giving the Spanish government active assistance!

Regarding the idea of saving people and the world, this great work repeatedly explains that Japan will inevitably intensify its aggression against China, and countries all over the world will inevitably fall into an inextricable predicament. Although it was said twenty years ago, the facts that have been exposed now are all consistent. Our national citizens, everyone following the teachings of the Premier, should all believe in this classic of saving the country and the world. Now, the US President specially invokes the Nine-Power Treaty to call on the world to uphold the treaty in order to restore peace in East Asia. The member states of the League of Nations also know that the US President's proposition is the forerunner of the common happiness of the world. However, the madness of the violent sun is raging, and the actions of various countries have not yet manifested. If they want to suppress the violent sun's full success, they must further affirm the true meaning of the treaty. The major principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are two: one is to respect China's sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity, and the other is the open door and equal opportunity. If you examine the spirit of the treaty in detail and observe the current facts, you will know that the second principle cannot be realized unless the righteousness of the first principle is promoted and its practical effect is ensured. To certify the Premier's plan to develop Chinese industries suggested to the world twenty years ago, it is enough to confirm that our citizens not only support the principle of the open door, but also are willing to cooperate with the world's countries in mutual assistance and peace on the principle of fairness and mutual assistance. In the conclusion of the Premier's plan to develop Chinese industries, the most pertinent words are, one, "Japan always obtains the greatest reward at the end of each war. No wonder the Japanese warlords regard war as the most profitable business. Now that China has awakened, Japan wants to implement its policy of aggression, and the Chinese will inevitably come out to reject it. Even if China is unfortunately occupied by Japan, Japan will never be able to rule it favorably at any time and place."; two, "(If the powers act truthfully to cooperate and consider the common interests, then the militarism will not be able to use their tricks to fight China for material things.)"; three, "(Those who seek to develop China's economy jointly for the mutual assistance of all countries can realize it, and those who seek the private interests of individuals or a nation should disappear invisibly.)" We follow the Premier's will and examine the international trends carefully. The belief that the Anti-Japanese War will be victorious and the nation will be built is already firmly immutable. At this time when sacred sacrifices have exerted unparalleled light, we especially hope that the soldiers and civilians of the country will vigorously promote the spirit of struggle, bravely advance to strive for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and lay the foundation for the construction of the Republic of China, so as to cooperate sincerely with the friendly countries of the world under the principle of mutual assistance and peace, and complete the great cause of building the Republic of China. Only in this way can we not live up to the heroic sacrifices of our millions of compatriots, and let our national citizens and their children and countless people in the world share the peaceful happiness created and guaranteed by our soldiers and civilians with their lives in infinity. The crazy thoughts, cunning attempts, and cruel acts of the Japanese warlords, which are being inflicted on our country today, will also lead to more tragic consequences for them to suffer. Since the September 18th Incident, the rebellious incidents that have been constantly occurring in their country have exposed their beginnings. Since the July 7th Incident, the evil consequences caused by the brutal actions may be even more numerous than the weapons and violence used to kill compatriots. Understanding the above, it can be known that resolutely resisting Japan is a consistent mission of the National Revolution, and it is also our only sincerity to save the country and the world. The crazy and cunning acts of the violent enemy are not only futile, but they will inevitably fall into a deep abyss from which they cannot extricate themselves. The plenary session believes that the determining factors of the final victory or defeat in the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War have already been planted in the past, and the spirit of bravery, loyalty, and unity of purpose of our soldiers and civilians from the beginning of the war to the present, as well as the actions of the world's friendly countries in upholding justice and safeguarding the treaty, have further established the foundation for our country's inevitable victory. Only because of this, from now on, our responsibility is even more arduous. If we want to defeat the violent enemy's last and most ferocious aggression, we must also exert all the heart and strength of our national citizens, and jointly devote ourselves to strengthening unity, actively struggling, and making efforts to build the country, and raising the national spirit to rectify revolutionary discipline, which is the guarantee for the success of the above three things. The main points are hereby revealed as left: (1) The so-called strengthening of unity, the meeting believes that unity must be based on sincerity, and the revolutionary spirit must seek its purity. The Provisional National Congress solemnly declared, hoping that the people of the country with aspirations would focus on the party and fight together. This meeting is now earnestly hoping that the country is in such a critical situation that we must try our best to increase the strength of resisting Japan and building the country, so as to achieve the effect of the people's aspirations becoming a city. Compatriots across the country, regardless of their past political views and factions, all those who are willing to practice the Three People's Principles and participate in the sacred cause of the National Revolution, the Anti-Japanese War, and the building of the country are sincerely welcome. However, the purpose of the National Revolution is to seek the independence of the country and the survival of the nation, so we must maintain the sincere and pure spirit of the Chinese nation, and then the foundation of the country can be permanently solidified. This meeting solemnly declares that we absolutely do not want to see the fact that the party leading the revolution has dual party membership, and we cannot bear to see the consistent ambition of China to practice the Three People's Principles and complete the revolutionary nation-building suffer setbacks due to the lack of firm belief and will. When the countries of the world began the revolution and nation-building, they were able to overcome difficulties and achieve success because the whole country was united and the upper and lower levels were of one mind. There is absolutely no second way in ancient and modern China and abroad. From now on, our compatriots must unite in spirit, do their best to be loyal, believe in and practice the Three People's Principles, make the best efforts for the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War, and lay an unshakable foundation for the great cause of nation-building. (2) The so-called active struggle, our compatriots should know that "walking a hundred miles is half ninety," and the last journey is often the most difficult. When we review all the work in the past, we have not tried our best, and what we have tried has not been completely certain, uncoordinated, or consistent in words and deeds. Contribute its full strength to adapt to the needs of wartime. The later stage of the Anti-Japanese War is actually the final success or failure of our country and the Japanese warlords. If all thoughts and actions in the front and rear, especially in the occupied areas or the soldiers and civilians near the war zone, cannot be strictly reflected, strictly reported, and strictly corrected, and if their abilities, freedom, and lives are completely contributed to the country, increasing the strength of the counterattack, then the achievements of countless martyrs' sacrifices and struggles will be in vain, and our nation will inevitably perish. Therefore, my comrades and compatriots, from now on, must share their loyalty, under the leadership of the Supreme Commander, without reservation, without hesitation, and move forward bravely to win the success of national independence and national survival in this great battle of life and death. (3) Regarding stepping up construction, we must know that the main force of nation-building lies in building an army. Without a national army as strong as gold and stone, people's livelihoods will not be guaranteed, people's rights will not be maintained, and the nation will not survive. Psychological construction, political construction, and economic construction are the foundation of building an army. The so-called psychological construction must be based on the Premier's theory of knowing is difficult and doing is easy, promote the Premier's main purpose of military spirit education, popularize national military training, enhance the effectiveness of education, promote wartime services, so that all compatriots in the country are revolutionary fighters of the Three People's Principles, and seek the final victory with the spirit of success or benevolence. The so-called political construction lies in strict rewards and punishments, comprehensive examination of names and realities, concentration of strength, increased efficiency, strengthened mass organizations, unified mass actions, relief of people's suffering, and improvement of people's lives. At the critical juncture of the beginning of the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War, where the survival of the country is at stake, it is especially appropriate to form a unified command organization of the central party, government, and army, so that the work of the national party and government can be closely integrated with the military, so as to achieve the effect of joint action. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Committee is specially established to unify the command of the party, government, and army. Regarding economic construction, it is not only related to the victory or defeat of the Anti-Japanese War, but also to the success or failure of nation-building. It must be based on the needs of the people's lives in wartime, distinguish between priorities, consider the urgency, implement controlled economic regulation of the production and consumption of materials, and do our best to vigorously promote heavy industries and mining industries necessary for the Anti-Japanese War, light industries necessary for people's daily use, railways, air lines, and highways needed for transportation. We must consolidate the currency system, facilitate finance, and promote the development of public and private industries. We must also improve agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, develop the country's resources, and increase the production capacity of various provinces. We must make concerted efforts between the government, the people, all capital, and technology to earnestly step up promotion. This economic construction is not only to enrich the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, but also to implement the foundation of people's livelihood. As for the governments and people of friendly countries in the world who provide mutual assistance in material and financial resources during the Anti-Japanese War, or provide spiritual and moral support, or relieve the soldiers and civilians who are wounded, sick, hungry, and cold, or help us to restore schools destroyed by the enemy, all these noble meanings will be eternally remembered. I am convinced that the result of this Anti-Japanese War in our country will be able to restore the integrity of our national sovereignty, territory, and administration, and will be able to revive the authority of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris. Not only will the principle of the open door and equal opportunity be implemented, but also the great plan proposed by our Premier to the world twenty years ago for the international peace and mutual assistance combination and joint development of Chinese industries will be realized here. With our richness of raw materials and the vastness of the market, and the urgency of construction needs after the war, in terms of absorbing foreign investment and technical cooperation, observing the existing capabilities of various industrial countries, there is absolutely no fear of its excess. Today, if the people of our country put in more effort, they will surely gain ten or a hundred times the benefits after the war. All true economic benefits are never private to the world and mankind. The above three things are the goals that our country should actively strive for, and the fundamental key lies in improving the national spirit and rectifying revolutionary discipline to realize the Three People's Principles of revolutionary nation-building. In the past, when the Premier gave lectures on the military spirit education, he explained in detail that "human beings have the use of spirit and do not rely solely on the physical body," and "if you want to undertake extraordinary undertakings, you must rely on extraordinary spirit." He specially cited wisdom, benevolence, and courage as the morals that revolutionaries and patriots must possess. Only wisdom that "conforms to morality" is the wisdom needed by the revolution. Only those who can "dare to go forward and never retreat in the face of adversity, and have the determination to die without hesitation" are the courage needed by the revolution. Only those who "sacrifice their lives to save the world, sacrifice their lives to save the country, do not ask about interests, and do their best to fulfill their responsibilities" are the benevolence on which the revolutionary cause depends for its success. There is no seeking life to harm benevolence, but there is killing life to achieve benevolence, starting with great wisdom and ending with great courage, before we can build the country, complete the revolution, and protect the endless life of our nation. At this critical juncture of life and death, my compatriots across the country can only be determined to become benevolent and take righteousness, practice the great way of the Three People's Principles, everyone swear to die, bravely be loyal, use our decades of mortal lives to establish the foundation of the country's eternal life for hundreds of millions of years, then there is no fear that the Anti-Japanese War will not be victorious, and there is no fear that the nation will not be built. All party comrades and all personnel in charge of national military and political affairs should especially be aware of their own responsibilities and the seriousness of revolutionary discipline, set an example and be the first to serve the people. We must establish strict discipline, establish the justice of rewarding merits and punishing demerits, and then we can gather the people's will into one mind and combine the people's strength into one body. We must not endanger the country due to the loss of one corner, or harm the public due to the mistake of one person. We must know that in the Anti-Japanese War, the life-and-death struggle with the enemy is in an instant, and the great cause of nation-building is a permanent and indestructible work. If it is not followed by strict discipline, how can we achieve the practical results of success? Therefore, the strict implementation of revolutionary discipline is the thorough revival of the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War. This is the greatest guarantee for the victory and success of the Anti-Japanese War and nation-building, and we must do our best to implement it. Our party, based on the historical mission of revolutionary nation-building, leads the entire people with firm determination at the autumn of national crisis and survival. The heavier the responsibility, the more difficult the mission, all my comrades must sincerely abide by the resolutions, be of one heart and one mind, accept the President's instructions to improve party morals and consolidate the foundation of the party, invigorate the spirit, concentrate the will, strengthen the faith, enrich the ability, go deep into the war zone, go deep into the occupied area, go deep into the countryside, work hard and persevere, set an example, and must go to the front first in the face of difficulties. With this spirit, do our best to fulfill our duties, and with this spirit, impress China and foreign countries. As for my compatriots across the country, hearing righteousness may have a sequence, but there is absolutely no difference in practicing righteousness. The ability of this Anti-Japanese War to persist without wavering and to overcome all difficulties is actually the great achievement of all compatriots across the country who are determined to sacrifice everything to engage in the great cause of saving the country and building the nation. Now the Anti-Japanese War has entered the later stage, and the great success is only one basket away. Those who gain the Tao will get more help, and the sympathy of the world has been gathered in our country. Those who have the will will achieve their goals, and the great achievement of rejuvenation will surely belong to our people. I hope that all party comrades and compatriots across the country will understand this meaning and devote all their efforts to it. (30th telegram)

### Telegraphic Message of Condolences to Anti-Japanese War Soldiers and Overseas Chinese

(Chongqing) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee specially sent telegraphic messages of condolences to all Anti-Japanese War soldiers and commendations to overseas Chinese. The original texts are recorded on the left: (1) Military Commission Chairman Chiang to all Anti-Japanese War soldiers: Since the war of resistance against the enemy, our soldiers in the war zones, under the unified command of the Supreme Commander, have been loyal and courageous, persevering with the enemy for a long time, and have achieved a solid foundation for the Anti-Japanese War and nation-building after a year and a half of struggle, making the people of the country more aware of the Anti-Japanese War and strengthening their confidence. The annihilation of stubborn enemies is just around the corner. This meeting reviews the past and encourages the future, and sincerely commends the meritorious service. I hope that you will continue to work hard and achieve complete success as soon as possible. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (2) Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission translates to all overseas Chinese: The violent sun is invading China with all its national strength. Our country has risen up to resist Japan in order to defend its sovereignty and strive for independence. After eighteen months of arduous efforts to defend the country, we have been able to consume the enemy's strength, defeat its fierce offensive, and put it in a predicament where it is difficult to advance or retreat and its will to fight is frustrated. This is indeed due to the Supreme Commander's effective supervision and the loyalty and courage of all the soldiers, and the love of the motherland and the enthusiastic donations of our overseas Chinese, and the international justice has also been extended because of this. The concerted efforts of the group are huge and grand, and the distant thoughts and enthusiasm are appreciated and relied on. Now, at the beginning of the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War, it is the most important key to success or failure. I hope that our overseas Chinese will deeply understand this and work harder to achieve complete success. This is our earnest hope. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (30th telegram)

### British Cabinet Reorganization, Accelerating Armaments Expansion, Currently Completing One Warship Per Week, Monthly Production Reaching 700 Aircraft

(London) Britain's armaments expansion program is now being actively pursued. The appointment of former First Sea Lord Admiral Chatfield as Minister for Coordination of Defence Affairs indicates that the government's activities in national defence must be accelerated, and their scope will be even more extensive than what has already been achieved. Regarding the naval sector, First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Samuel Hoare recently declared that British shipyards could complete more than one warship per week in a short period. Naval figures attach great importance to this. Moreover, there are seventeen battleships under construction, at least twelve of which will have their tonnage increased from 35,000 tons to around 40,000 tons, so that the British Navy's superiority over other countries can be maintained and enhanced. As for the recruitment of naval personnel, a special reserve force can be established without ordering mobilization. Regarding the army, the government is currently conducting widespread propaganda to recruit new soldiers, but the results are still difficult to predict. Regarding the air force, British aircraft factories can currently produce 400 aircraft per month. Well-informed sources believe that this can be increased to 700 aircraft between June and July of this year. At that time, the difference between the British and German aircraft production rates will be rapidly reduced. However, one thing must be noted: British aircraft industry need not be forced, while German factories, due to accelerated production, have some of their machinery already outdated. (29th Havas dispatch)

(London) The changes in the British cabinet have attracted great attention here, especially the appointment of Lord Chatfield as Minister for Coordination of Defence Affairs, which is considered the most important. It is said that his mission will be to pave the way for new sacrifices, as the accelerated pace of rearmament in all areas will require the entire nation to make these new sacrifices. (31st Reuters dispatch)

(London) Lord Strathcona, Director-General of Munitions Production at the War Office, recently resigned due to dissatisfaction with the progress of armaments expansion. Recently, Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson also submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Chamberlain for the same reason. The Prime Minister, relying heavily on him, persuaded him to stay, and Hudson withdrew his resignation. (12th Havas dispatch)  Official Trotter. The British government has ordered 200 military aircraft from the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in the United States. Fourteen of these were shipped from here to Liverpool, England, today on the "Lochavon" ship. These aircraft are monoplanes, equipped with two Wright Cyclone 200 horsepower engines, and their range can reach 3,000 kilometers. (29th Havas dispatch)

### Chamberlain's Speech, Satisfied Germany and Italy

Italian Newspapers Still Attacking France

(Berlin) German newspapers have published Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham on Saturday night in a very prominent position. Although there are several points in Chamberlain's speech that are not welcomed by Berlin, the newspapers' criticisms are generally brief and commendatory, stating that Germany desires peace, but peace must be just and equitable among equal nations. The inaccurate information published in several British and French newspapers has created a bad atmosphere. General Goering's mouthpiece, the National Daily, stated that the Prime Minister does not seem to distinguish between peace-loving people and their governments, and asked whether the Prime Minister was referring to the United States, France, or the Soviet Union. The newspaper believes that there is not much hope for disarmament, as Britain's rearmament will naturally be followed by other countries. (30th Reuters dispatch)

(Rome) Italian Daily editor Guido Gayda recently published an article in the Italian People's Voice, a weekly publication of the newspaper, expressing approval of Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on Saturday, calling it a clear and sincere speech, and listing Chamberlain's proposals for seeking a practical plan for European peace through negotiation, saying that we can unhesitatingly acknowledge its sincerity. Italy wishes to see the cooperation advocated in Chamberlain's proposal put into practice. Gayda also stated that Italy has no demands on Britain, only asking that it understand certain major issues that have no impact on Britain. Therefore, if Britain can stay away from harmful forces within the country and the oppression of other powers that oppose the rights of Italy and Germany, there should be no obstacles between Britain and Italy. However, it is still unknown when the selfishness of those who have too much and the needs of those who have too little can be reconciled. (30th Reuters dispatch)

(Rome) The People's Post recently commented on the relations between France and Italy, comparing 20th-century France to ancient Carthage (located in present-day Tunis in North Africa), stating that Italy's intervention in the Spanish Civil War was motivated not only by ideology but also by military strategy. The Carthaginian general Hannibal once invaded Rome via Spain. Now, France can also mobilize Libyan troops from Africa and invade Italy through Spain, which must be prevented in advance. "Prime Minister Mussolini now wants to destroy the path of barbarian attacks on Rome in the Mediterranean, which can be compared to the Roman general Scipio, who defeated Hannibal." (29th Havas dispatch)

(Rome) The Stampa newspaper recently stated that Italy's desires in the Mediterranean are most concerned with Corsica and Tunisia. "In the minds of Italians, Corsica and Tunisia represent a thing, a soul. This thing and soul have existed for us for centuries, and successive generations have had a definite desire for them. The realization of this desire is not far off. Although we do not know when it will be realized or how it will be realized, one thing is certain: the ideals of an entire nation cannot be overcome by various strategies." (29th Havas dispatch)

Thousands of residents of Modane in the Savoy region of France recently held demonstrations near the Italian border, led by the mayors of various villages and towns, protesting against Italy's proclaimed desires. In addition to holding French flags, the demonstrators also displayed various slogans, saying "Savoy is one with France" and "The French colonial empire belongs to France." The demonstrators marched for two kilometers, and all the houses along the way responded by hanging flags, even the houses inhabited by Italians. (According to reports, there are many Italians in this area.) The demonstrators then arrived at the war memorial of the city to the sound of the French national anthem, where the chairman of the city council gave a speech, declaring that the people of Savoy are loyal to their motherland.

### German Parliament Opens, Hitler Speaks

Sixth Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Rule, Goebbels Says Three Difficulties Have Been Overcome

(Berlin) Today is the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, as well as the opening day of the first parliament of Greater Germany. Führer Hitler will attend and deliver an important speech, which is highly anticipated by the people of the whole country. National flags have been hung everywhere here, and white columns have been built on the major roads leading to the Kroll Opera House (the parliament meeting place), with large flags hanging on them, which is very spectacular. Loudspeakers are installed in various squares for the public to listen to the Führer's speech. Pedestrians give way on the road, as if it were a festival. All schools are closed. According to official announcements, the Governor of Austria, Ingard, and the Commissioner of the Sudetenland, Henlein, will sit together in parliament, symbolizing the completion of the Greater German nation. Führer Hitler was very busy this morning and received the people who won the National Literature and Science Awards last year at noon and awarded them medals. (30th Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) The troops stationed around Berlin beat drums and played music this morning to participate in the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. The troops paraded through the main streets, and the formation was neat and moving. The red, black, and white swastika flags were hung in every street. A large number of workers are still very busy repairing the grand theater in order to have the parliament meet tonight. The time when Hitler addresses the parliament is expected to be after 7:30 in the evening (30th Reuters dispatch). Tonight, when Hitler goes to the parliament, additional electric lights will be installed on the streets he passes through, so that it can be seen as daytime, to highlight Hitler's elegance. (30th Haitong dispatch)

(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a radio speech to the youth of the entire country today on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, saying that the Third Germany has no other way out than National Socialism. Goebbels emphasized that six years ago, on January 30, 1933, when Hitler came to power, Germany faced three difficulties: (1) no strong army to defend the borders, (2) a wavering foreign policy, and (3) a huge number of unemployed people. Today, all three difficulties have been broken. "German youth do not need to learn history in schools, but witness the creation of history. The special significance of this year's commemoration is that Germany has become a Greater Germany." He ended by calling for "the youth of the whole country to unanimously support the Führer."

### Spanish Government Troops Defend New Front Line

Nationalist Troops Also Make Progress

(London) After the Spanish government troops withdrew from Barcelona, they have now established a new line of defence and are fiercely resisting. According to a dispatch from Burgos, the Nationalist troops on all fronts are advancing an average of five miles. According to news from Girona, fierce battles are currently taking place in some areas. The Chief of Staff of the government troops declared that the military news received is all favorable. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Figueres. Yesterday, many refugees in this city, supporting the old and carrying the young, went to the Jonquera area to wait for trains to France. The situation was very chaotic for a time, but today it has gradually returned to normal. The highway from this city to the Jonquera area has also been cleared. The food problem has been resolved. The most pressing problem at present is the housing problem. In addition to requisitioning empty houses to accommodate refugees, the government is also working hard to evacuate the population as a fundamental solution. Nationalist aircraft bombed this city several times this morning. In addition to some material losses, there were few casualties among the residents. After the various departments of the Republican government moved here, they have now resumed normal operations. The cabinet regularly holds meetings to discuss the overall plan for the war of resistance. In addition, most of the members of parliament have also arrived here from various places one after another, and the parliament will be convened for a reconvening within days. As far as the war situation on the front line is concerned, the situation is very optimistic. Government troops launched a counterattack this afternoon in Mataró and Alella, which was very successful. (29th Havas date)

Barcelona After the Nationalist troops won in Catalonia, they have almost completely taken control of all the textile industry in the country. The number of textile factories destroyed in the war is not very large. Seventy percent of them can be restored to work with a little reorganization. The main problem now is the lack of funds. The machinery and raw materials of all factories were originally purchased from London. Now there is no cash, and it is necessary to first obtain credit from the United Kingdom in order to be able to help. In addition, there are also difficulties in transportation. Most of the highway bridges have been destroyed by artillery fire, and the continuous flow of military vehicles has blocked the supply of food to the residents, let alone other things. Taking this port as an example, its transportation with the Balearic Islands can only be carried out after all the mines placed by the government troops have been cleared in order to transport food here.

### British Parliament to Discuss Aid to China Today

Zhang Pengchun is Popular in London, Indian Alliance Advocates Boycott of Japanese Goods

(London) Although the British House of Commons will focus on the overall European situation in tomorrow's foreign policy debate, members who are paying attention to the situation in China will work hard in the next session to strengthen the government's position so that it can take more active actions in the Far East to help China and protect British interests in China. This week, many newspapers have repeatedly stated that the Far Eastern situation is becoming increasingly serious. Dr. Zhang Pengchun, a professor at Nankai University, recently arrived here from China and has now been invited to present everything to the China Committee of the House of Commons on February 7. Since arriving in London, Dr. Zhang Bo has been very active in public speaking or private talks, and has had a long conversation with Waijue in West Ted Jadgan.

Two resolutions were immediately passed, one advocating a boycott of Japanese goods and prohibiting the supply of funds and various goods, including kerosene, to Japan, and the other calling on "British progressive forces to make efforts to bring the relationship between Britain, India, and the colonies closer." (29th Havas dispatch)

(Washington) Pison, a well-known expert on Far Eastern issues, recently submitted a report to the Foreign Affairs Association, stating that Germany and Japan are currently cooperating with each other to maintain the land occupied by Japan in East Asia. Germany and Italy both hope to be in a "superior position" in the so-called Sino-Japanese "Man" group. After cooperating with Japan, the territories held by Western countries in the Far East are increasingly at risk of being specially attacked. (29th Havas dispatch)

(London) A mass demonstration convened by the Indian League in support of Indian independence was attended by thousands of Indians residing in London and left-leaning Britons.

### US Aircraft Sales to France Cause Discord

(Washington) A new type of aircraft manufactured by a US aircraft factory crashed during a test flight on the 23rd of this month in Los Angeles, killing many people. As a result, the French aviation department representatives Schmidlin and his party are in trouble. It is heard that discord has arisen between the Navy Department and the Army Department. Although no one has criticized the French government's right to order aircraft from US factories, the US Army Headquarters has criticized the Navy Department for allowing foreign military officers to participate in the test flight of new types of aircraft for the Army, which is beyond its authority. (29th Havas dispatch)

(Washington) The US Congress will reconvene this week. The main issues to be discussed at that time will be related to foreign affairs and national defense. It is generally believed that the most important of these are (1) the sale of aircraft by various aircraft factories to France and other countries, (2) the establishment of a naval base on Guam in the central Pacific and its funding, (3) the internal problems of Spain, and (4) the diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico, especially the debt problem of the US oil companies whose oil mines were nationalized by the Mexican government.

### Molotov Announces Completion of the Second "Five-Year Plan"

Industrial Development Rate Ranks First in the World; However, Total Production is Still Deemed Insufficient; The Third "Five-Year Plan" Emphasizes Chemistry

(Moscow) The Eighteenth National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, scheduled to convene on March 10th, will hear a report from Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, on the state of economic development. The report, to be presented for discussion, states that the Second Five-Year Economic Plan has been completed, all classes engaged in exploitation have been eliminated, and the collectivization of agricultural economic organizations, as well as the sustained cultural revolution, have been successful. Once the Third Five-Year Economic Plan is implemented, its effects will be that all kinds of equipment will be technologically suited to the needs of national defense, and economic independence will be achieved. At that time, industrial production, national income, and the circulation of goods will certainly increase dramatically, work efficiency can be improved by sixty-five percent, and the cost of industrial products can be reduced by eleven percent. After agricultural mechanization, the amount of agricultural produce can be increased, 11,000 kilometers of railway lines can be added, and regular shipping routes can be established between the country and the Far East. All these achievements require the sequential implementation of the planned program. The main conditions are as follows: (1) In 1942, the last year of the Third Five-Year Economic Plan, the value of industrial production should increase to 180,000,000,000 rubles; (2) the output of coal mines should be increased; (3) oil stations should be added in the Volga and Ural river basins; (4) a liquid fuel industry should be established in the east; (5) the chemical industry should be developed; (6) four million specialized workers should be trained, and six hundred thousand workers should be instilled with deeper knowledge; (7) secondary schools should be opened in various cities, and children in all townships should be required to attend school from the age of seven. (Havas Dispatch, 30th)

(Moscow) Local newspapers recently published the main points of Molotov's report to the Eighteenth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party on March 10th regarding the Third Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet National Economy. The article first pointed out that as a result of the successful completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, its main historical tasks have been completed, all exploiting classes have been eliminated, and all factors that could lead to exploitation of people by people and the division of society into exploiters and exploited have been eradicated. The most difficult task of the socialist revolution, the collectivization of agriculture, has been completed, and the collective farm system has taken deep root. The first stage of communist society has been basically established in the country, and the victory of socialism has been legally embodied in the new constitution. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, socialist industry accounted for 98.7% of the total national production funds, and socialist production had completely controlled the entire national economy, reaching 99.8% of the total industrial production, 98.6% of the total agricultural production, and 100% of the total trade volume. In 1937, workers and staff employed by the socialist economy accounted for 34.7% of the total national population, collective farmers and handicraftsmen united in handicraft cooperatives accounted for 55.5%, and soldiers, students, dependents, and others accounted for an estimated 4.2%. Thus, 94.4% of the national population is directly engaged in the socialist economy or has a close relationship with it. The main and decisive task of the Second Five-Year Plan, the complete technical transformation of the national economy, has been largely resolved. In 1937, more than 80% of the total industrial production came from factories newly built or completely transformed during the First and Second Five-Year Plans. Ninety percent of all tractors and combine harvesters used in agriculture were manufactured domestically during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Industry completed the outline of the Second Five-Year Plan in April 1937, in just four years and three months. The railway transport sector was completed and exceeded within four years. The agricultural sector also exceeded in terms of grain and cotton. Industrial production in 1937 increased by 120% compared to 1932, while the original plan was only 114%. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, average annual industrial production increased by 17.1%, while the plan was 16.5%. Cadres who can grasp new technologies have been trained in all economic sectors. The greatest success is the emergence of important cadres among the Soviet intelligentsia and the bold promotion of new leading workers in all economic departments, whether they are Bolsheviks inside or outside the party. This kind of cadre is essential in all aspects of socialist construction, and the Stakhanovite movement vividly reflects the success of grasping new technologies. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the labor productivity of large-scale industry increased by 82%, while the original plan was only 63%.

The task of raising the material and cultural standards of the working class and increasing the level of consumption more than twofold, as stipulated in this plan, has also been completed. The number of workers and staff in various departments of the national economy increased by 17.6%. The average annual wage of workers and staff increased by 113.5% in 1937 compared to 1932. The state allocated funds for workers' and peasants' culture and material services (education, health, etc.) increasing from 4.4 billion to 14 billion rubles. In the four years from 1933 to 1937, the total income of collective farmers increased by 2.7 times. The production of necessities in 1937 increased more than twofold compared to 1932. The total volume of state and cooperative trade increased more than threefold. Because a cultural revolution actually took place in the country during the plan period, the number of primary and secondary school students increased from 21.6 million to 29.4 million, and the number of university students increased to 550,000. The material and cultural progress of the people of Soviet Central Asia has been rapid. During the Third Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union entered a new stage of development, the construction of a completely classless socialist society, a stage of gradual transition from socialism to communism. In this stage, the communist education of the working people, with the aim of overcoming the remnants of capitalism in the hearts of the builders of communism, has acquired decisive importance.

The Soviet Union has already transformed itself into an economically independent country, capable of supplying its own economy and national defense with all necessary technical equipment. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of industrial development rate, but the inadequacy of the total Soviet industrial production compared with the most advanced capitalist countries in technology and economy must be thoroughly eliminated, so that communism can achieve the final victory in the historical competition with capitalism. We are now able and must take upon ourselves the responsibility of completing the main economic tasks of the Soviet Union, catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in Europe and the United States in the economic field, and thoroughly resolving this issue in the near future. At the same time, during the new plan period, we must promote the increase of national income and trade volume, so that the consumption of the people can be increased by one and a half to two times. Further, in coordination with these main tasks, we must improve the cultural level of all urban and rural working people, and elevate the cultural and technical level of the working class, the most advanced leading force of socialist society, to the level of engineers and technicians.

During the Second Five-Year Plan, industry and the entire national economy have made great progress, and now it is required to grow further and unhindered according to a fixed plan. Under the conditions of the imperialist forces intensifying their aggression and surrounding the Soviet Union, it is necessary to create a large amount of national reserves, first of all regarding the development of fuel, electricity, a part of the national defense industry, and transportation.

In coordination with these tasks, the article proposed the following items: stipulating that in 1942 (the final year of the Third Five-Year Plan), the total industrial production of the Soviet Union should be 1.8 trillion rubles, an increase of 88% compared to 955 billion in 1937, of which the production of means of production should increase by 103%, and the production of consumer goods should increase by 69%. In the same year, the Soviet industry should produce 1.4 million cars, produce 750 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 230 million tons of coal, 54 million tons of oil, 22 million tons of pig iron, 27.5 million tons of steel, 21 million tons of rolled steel, and chemical products worth 13.4 billion rubles. The production of the machinery manufacturing industry should increase by 2.25 times, internal steam turbines by 4.8 times, steam boilers by 4.6 times. The production of coal should be increased, so that it is not only sufficient for domestic needs, but also establishes national reserves. A new oil base "Second Baku" should be established between the Volga and the Ural Mountains. The gasification of various fuels should be developed, especially the underground gasification of coal, making it an independent industry. An artificial liquid fuel industry should be created based on the hydrogenation of hard fuels, first in the east, and gas should be artificially converted into liquid fuel. The total power generation of various power plants should be increased to 2.1 times. The chemical industry should be transformed into one of the main industrial sectors to meet the needs of the national economy and national defense. The Third Five-Year Plan should be a chemical five-year plan, and the production of the chemical industry should increase by 2.3 times. The steel industry should also continue to increase production, so that the plan should also become a five-year plan for special steel. The production of general consumer goods should increase by 1.7 times. The labor productivity of the working industry should increase by 65%, and the production cost should be reduced by 11%.

In agriculture, the total production value should increase from 198 billion rubles in 1937 to 302 billion rubles in 1942, an increase of 53%. At the same time, the average annual grain harvest should increase from 550 million poods during the Second Five-Year Plan to 700 million poods, an increase of 27%. By 1942, the harvest of industrial crops should increase to 39 million quintals of sugar beets, 32.9 million quintals of cotton, and 8.5 million quintals of flax. Among livestock, horses should increase by 35%, cattle by 40%, pigs by 100%, and sheep and goats by 110%. The mechanization of agricultural methods should be thoroughly completed.

In transportation, railway freight should increase from 355 billion ton-kilometers in 1937 to 510 billion ton-kilometers in 1942, river freight from 33 billion ton-kilometers to 58 billion ton-kilometers, and sea freight from 37 billion to 51 billion ton-kilometers. The number of railway locomotives should increase by 7,370, vehicles by 190,000, 11,000 kilometers of new railways should be built, 8,000 kilometers of switches should be laid, and 1,840 kilometers of railways should be electrified. The navigable waterways of inland rivers should be expanded from 101,000 kilometers to 115,000 kilometers. By the end of this plan, the Arctic Ocean route should be turned into a regularly navigable waterway to maintain normal traffic with the Far East. Automobile transportation should increase by 4.6 times, and 210,000 kilometers of highways should be built and renovated.

Unease in Japan

### Many Professors Dismissed and Forced to Resign from Tokyo Imperial University

Dr. Kawai's Book Banned from Publication; The Emperor Approves Important Cabinet Resolutions

(Tokyo) A book written by Dr. Kawai, a professor of political economy at the Imperial University, has been banned from publication by the authorities for being deemed disruptive to peace and order. Since the new president, Dr. Hiraga, took office, he has been engaged in purging unstable elements, resulting in the dismissal or resignation of six professors, four assistant professors, one lecturer, and four assistant lecturers in the Department of Political Economy. Only three professors and two assistant professors remain. However, Hiraga, with the help of Minister of Education General Araki, is stubbornly pursuing the purge and will not stop until the existing people are removed. At the same time, he is engaged in appeasing the students, because the students, who had just lost many professors on January 31st when the academic year was about to end, are all very distraught. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)

(Tokyo) It is heard that the Cabinet held an extraordinary meeting last Thursday, after which a resolution of utmost importance was submitted to the Emperor for approval, but its contents are not yet suitable for announcement. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)

(Tokyo) During a parliamentary session today, a member of parliament mentioned a news item published in the London Chronicle on January 27th and asked Foreign Minister Arita about the new agreement between Japan and Italy, questioning whether Japan intends to conclude such an agreement, and stating that if such an agreement is under consideration, its meaning would be no less than Italy demanding an agreement that not only opposes the Soviet Union but also resists the United States and Britain. Arita gave a brief answer, saying that the purpose of the Anti-Comintern Pact is purely anti-communist and has no other meaning. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)

(Tokyo) According to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the meeting of Japanese ambassadors and ministers to Europe recently concluded in Paris was intended for the newly appointed Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, to inform the other ambassadors of news about the Sino-Japanese War. Similar meetings may be held in Berlin and Rome in the future. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)

(Tokyo) When the House of Representatives met this morning to debate the budget bill, it discussed strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the special military expenditure for the "China Incident." Seiyukai's Haraguchi advocated strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact between the three countries. Foreign Minister Arita replied that the establishment of the pact was originally intended for the signatory countries to jointly defend against the destructive activities of the Third International and had no other purpose. Various reports were not credible. When the pact was established, the Communist Party was very active in China, and China had opened up many "Soviet areas." At that time, Japan, in view of the need to conclude an anti-communist pact with China, had begun negotiations with the Chiang Kai-shek government, but it ultimately failed. Subsequently, the Third International established close cooperation with the Chiang Kai-shek government, and its destructive activities in Europe, as witnessed in Spain, can serve as clear evidence. Arita refused to disclose the nature of the plan that the Japanese government is currently discussing to curb the Third International from continuing to engage in destructive projects. Next, Finance Minister Ishiwata mentioned the special military expenditure, saying that it is impossible to predict how long this military expenditure for the "China Incident" will continue, but Japan's special military expenditure for the European War had been listed as a special item, starting in 1916 and lasting for ten years. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)

(Paris) Japanese officials here recently announced that the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Aoi, Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, Ambassador to Belgium, Kurusu, Minister to the National Government of Spain, Yano, and Minister to Switzerland, Amau, are now gathered here for talks. General Oshima, the Ambassador to Germany, sent a representative due to illness, but this is not called a meeting. According to reliable sources, the nature of this gathering of Japanese diplomats is not entirely the same as the regularly scheduled meetings. It is heard that this time it was initiated by the ambassadors to Germany and Italy to gather various information in order to determine whether the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan has the possibility of expanding its scope. Regarding this level, the views of Japanese envoys to various European countries differ. General Oshima and Shiratori Toshio advocate promoting relations with Germany and Italy, and when necessary, signing a treaty of alliance with them. Other envoys say that a reserved attitude should be adopted towards various European issues. Which faction's view will prevail will depend on how the European situation develops. In addition, the Paris Evening News reported that the meeting of Japanese envoys was intended to draft a military alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and that this treaty could be established in a short period of time. The representative of Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, and Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, told the other envoys at the meeting that the reason why China's resistance is so resolute is due to the support of various democratic countries. For Japan's sake, it is necessary to promote relations with various totalitarian countries in order to strike a blow at various democratic countries. (Havas, 29th)

The Japanese authorities claimed yesterday that the publication will be postponed for a few days. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)

### Heavy Casualties for Japanese Troops in Xiuwu

(Luoyang) The Japanese troops in Xiuwu, northern Henan Province, who have been acting rashly, have suffered heavy casualties due to continuous attacks by the Chinese army. On the night of the 26th, they were attacked again by the Chinese army in three directions. One route was from Qiaotian Town "12 li north of Daiwang," one route was from Weicun, "2 li north of Xiuwu," and one route attacked the Japanese army's flank from the northwest of Huojia. The Japanese troops were overwhelmed and engaged in several hours of chaotic fighting and multiple hand-to-hand combats. By around 5:00 AM, the Japanese troops were unable to hold their ground and retreated towards Xiuwu. The Chinese army advanced to press the city, withdrawing only at dawn. In this battle, more than 150 Japanese soldiers were killed, while the Chinese army also suffered over 50 casualties among officers and soldiers. (30th dispatch)

Advocates of peace will be scorned by the entire nation. If necessary, we are prepared for a thousand years of struggle.

(Chongqing) General Bai Chongxi, commander-in-chief of the Chinese forces in the southwestern provinces, addressed the Muslim Federation here, urging China's 50 million Muslims to quickly organize and vigorously support the government's war of resistance against Japan. He stated that if China continues to resolutely resist, victory can certainly be achieved within three years. He also said that all those who advocate for peace will be scorned by the entire nation. Advancing means life, retreating means death. The Japanese have often said that the Sino-Japanese war may last up to a hundred years, but we are prepared, if necessary, to fight for a thousand years, and we will not hesitate to do so.

### Japanese Troops Constructing Fortifications in Wuchang and Yueyang

Changde According to reports from the front: (1) Because the section of railway from Wuchang to Yueyang is repeatedly destroyed by the Chinese army and cannot be used, the Japanese have recently dispatched troops to be stationed at stations along the line and constructed strong fortifications to defend them. It is estimated that Xianning currently has 500-600 Japanese infantry, over 100 cavalry, and 4 artillery pieces. Tingsiqiao has over 100 Japanese soldiers, Puqi has over 400 Japanese mules and horses, 4 artillery pieces, and a small squad of engineers. Yanglousi has 400 Japanese soldiers, and Linxiang has over 1,000 Japanese soldiers.

Xin Kaitang has 200 Japanese soldiers and 2 small cannons. Guo Town has 200 Japanese infantry, over 50 cavalry, and 3 artillery pieces. The troops stationed everywhere use searching as a pretext to harass the villages, raping, pillaging, and killing. Residents have suffered greatly, and everyone harbors deep hatred.

### Ji'an Suffers Tragic Bombing by Japanese Aircraft: Nearly 100 Dead and Wounded, Dozens of Houses Destroyed

Ji'an Correspondence: At 10:17 AM on the 11th of this month, the Air Defense Command received a report that 18 Japanese aircraft were flying south from Qingjiang and Zhangshu. The command immediately issued an air raid alert, followed by an emergency alert, and ordered all garrison troops to mobilize and maintain strict vigilance. By 11:13 AM, 9 Japanese aircraft were circling several times over the urban area and dropped over 100 bombs in the vicinity of Taiping Bridge in the suburbs and the Longyang Pavilion area of Shanghe Street, including many incendiary bombs. Dozens of civilian houses were destroyed and burned, and nearly 100 civilians were killed and wounded. This was truly an unprecedented catastrophe for Ji'an. After wreaking havoc, the Japanese aircraft fled northwest. The alert was lifted around 12:00 PM. After the incident, an investigation revealed that the Japanese aircraft dropped a total of 188 bombs, 169 of which landed in the suburbs and 19 within the urban area. The locations in the city included 2 at the Huoshen Temple, 3 at Daxingkou, 2 at Houshanghe Street, 3 at Longyang Pavilion, 1 at Zhongshan Pier, 2 under Tianhou Palace by the river, 1 at Rongshu Pier, 1 at Xiahe Street, 3 at Shang Yongshu Road, and 1 at Zhanqian Pier. Moreover, incendiary bombs landed at Longyang Pavilion, burning more than a dozen shops. A total of 43 civilian houses were destroyed elsewhere, along with 7 civilian boats and 1 steamer. 28 citizens died (18 men and 10 women), and 78 were injured. However, there were also many women washing clothes along the river and workers on boats who were bombed into the river. Since the bodies have not surfaced, it is impossible to count them, so the actual number of deaths and injuries is not limited to this.

When Longyang Pavilion was hit and caught fire, the fire brigade rushed to the scene amidst the air raid sirens to put out the fire. The Air Defense Command also ordered officers and soldiers from various teams to assist. Afterwards, Commander Yang Tingya personally led Chief of Staff Chen Zhentang, County Magistrate Hu Yunhong, Police Chief Yang Zhenchang, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xiao Zongchuan, and others to the bombed sites to supervise firefighting, rescue, and security. As a result, order was restored immediately, but post-disaster work urgently needed to be carried out. Therefore, County Magistrate Hu ordered the police bureau to quickly clear the fire site and rescue the victims, and also sent personnel to the Provincial Hospital and the Catholic Hospital to register the number of injured and handle the burial of the dead.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chaoshan Areas, Japanese Soldiers Attempt to Land but Fail

Shantou Correspondence: The number of Japanese warships outside Mayu Estuary off Shantou suddenly increased starting on the 18th. Two Japanese gunboats were also anchored in the north and south ports of Chenghai. Three giant Japanese warships were anchored near Nan'ao. Recently, three giant Japanese warships have appeared again on the sea off Chaoyang and Huilai. On the 18th, sailors took motorboats to Nan'ao and landed in two groups. One group entered Houzhai Long'ao, setting fire to the public education center (i.e., the county government administrative office). The other group climbed the mountain to search for guerrilla forces, looting 150 bags of relief rice, burning more than 20 civilian houses, and harassing the area for four hours before leaving. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, the Japanese patrol ship Yubari commanded four destroyers to shell the areas along the coast of Shenquan and Jinghai in Huilai, and Hedutou and Dahao in Chaoyang, and Nangang and Yanzao in Chenghai. The shells landed in the wilderness outside the villages. At night, they used lights to illuminate the coastline, attempting to land under cover of darkness. The ships dispatched three aircraft to drop three bombs on the Haifeng Shanwei Provincial Aquatic Products School, and flew low for fifteen minutes, strafing residents. Seven civilian houses were destroyed, and six people were killed or injured. At 8:00 AM on the 21st, Japanese aircraft again flew to the Shantou Railway Station of the Chaoshan Railway for a fierce attack. Passengers scattered and fled in a panic. The aircraft flew to Chao'an Xiangzi Bridge and dropped bombs, attempting to bomb the Xiangzi Bridge, but the two bombs landed on cargo ships under the bridge, destroying five civilian boats and killing or injuring seven or eight boatmen, with a loss of over 10,000 yuan in cargo. The aircraft then flew to Jieyang and dropped bombs at the Fengjie Station, shooting at pedestrians. Afterwards, it flew over Puning, Huilai, and Lufeng, wreaking havoc everywhere. Scoundrels spread various rumors, causing panic. The newly appointed Mayor of Shantou, Wu Qi, came from Shaoguan to Shantou to maintain order. The commander of the Ninth Guerrilla District, Liu Zhilu, went to Shao for official business. Deputy Commander Chen Shumu led troops to Chenghai Waisha to defend the front line. The commander of the Eighth Guerrilla District, Weng Zhaoyuan, also personally went to Haimen in Chaoyang to prepare for battle. At present, foreign ships are still entering and leaving the port as usual, but all sailboats and fishing boats have stopped going to sea. Traffic between Nan'ao and Chaoshan has therefore been cut off again. It is said that Japanese warships are deliberately creating a diversion on the Fujian border, claiming to attack Chaozhou and Meizhou, in order to contain the units of the East River Chinese army counterattacking Guangzhou.

### The Problem of Shipping Ningbo Local Goods for Export

The Chamber of Commerce only cares about the livelihood of workers and farmers and ignores the national war of resistance laws.

Ningbo Correspondence: After the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to designate 55 kinds of goods such as cotton as prohibited from being transported to Japan and its colonies, entrusted ruling areas, and areas occupied by violence, the citizens of various industries in Ningbo have been requesting relief. Chairman Zhou of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce also said that cotton, cotton yarn, tea, paper, and other goods banned for export are the main local products of eastern Zhejiang, which are deeply and significantly related to the rural economy and local finance. Once exports are banned, millions of workers and farmers in eastern Zhejiang will lose their livelihoods. Moreover, the end of the commercial settlement period is approaching. The value of these local products is estimated to be over 20 million yuan. If they cannot be shipped for export before the end of the settlement period, the local finances will immediately collapse. After requesting the Zhejiang Customs Commissioner An Naidi to forward the request to Commissioner-General Mei, he also telegraphed the two ministers of finance and economy, asking them to quickly send a telegram to the Zhejiang Customs to allow local goods such as cotton, tea, and eggs to be exported. Yesterday, he also visited Jin Handing, the director of the First Inspection Team of the Military Discipline of the War Zone of the Military Affairs Commission, who had arrived in Ningbo, and explained everything in detail. Jin agreed to telegraph Chairman Chiang and ask him to order the two ministries of finance and economy to order the Zhejiang Customs to allow the export of local goods such as cotton to maintain livelihoods and strengthen finance.

### Japanese Troops in Guangdong Desperately Seek to Advance Westward: Repeated Bombings of Sanshui, Gaoming, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou; Japanese Warships Move to Xuwen

Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in Guangdong Province, with the Japanese army focusing on the Xijiang southern route, has gradually been confirmed. Therefore, most of the reinforcements recently sent by the Japanese army from Taiwan to Guangzhou have gone directly to Sanshui and along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway to Jiujiang, strengthening defensive fortifications in various places southwest of Sanshui to facilitate the advancement of troops. It is estimated that Sanshui has increased to more than 5,000 people in recent days, and the Jiujiang area has about 4,000 people. However, the Japanese army is suffering from attacks behind their lines, so even after increasing troops, they still dare not launch a large-scale westward offensive. Guerrilla forces near Lubao in Sanshui have been extremely active recently, and the Japanese troops stationed there are constantly constrained. The Japanese army, angered by the villagers, dispatched a small mortar team to Genya Village in Nanbian Township, Lubao on the 20th of the month, and carried out large-scale burning and looting. More than 60 shops in Nanbian Township were burned. At the same time, Japanese aircraft flew to Genya Village and dropped bombs, destroying more than 50 houses and killing 60-70 villagers. As for the Japanese troops acting rashly in Sanshui, they once used fir rafts to cross the river and attacked Jinli and old Sanshui. The Chinese army calmly fought back, waiting for the Japanese troops to cross halfway before opening fire. As a result, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed, some drowned in the river, and they retreated in a state of great disarray after more than an hour. The Japanese army, unable to carry out their plan to cross the river, sent twelve aircraft on the morning of the 20th to fly to Gaoming County seat in front of Jiujiang and Qianqian, dropping more than forty bombs, destroying more than thirty houses and killing or injuring more than forty people. Before the Japanese infantry advance, they must first send aircraft to bomb the rear of the Chinese army, which is their only common tactic. According to current observations, the total number of Japanese soldiers in Sanshui and Jiujiang is only more than 10,000. At a minimum, the Japanese army must leave half of its forces to defend the area, and the other half to advance. The Japanese troops defending the two places must also be responsible for defending against guerrillas. Therefore, the maximum number of troops that can be advanced from Sanshui and Jiujiang is only six or seven thousand. It is not easy to use this force to try to spy on Zhaoqing and Sihui and invade Guangxi Province. At present, the Xijiang Chinese army is temporarily taking a defensive posture, judging whether the main force of the Japanese army will advance westward or attack southward, and then launch a fierce counterattack, so that the Japanese army cannot take care of both ends and can be defeated individually.

The Japanese army is increasing its troops on the southern route, using Weizhou Island as a base, trying to land in Beihai, to raid Nanning in Guangxi Province, and go to Longzhou to cut off the Sino-Vietnamese international transportation line. This has been planned for a long time and has recently become more active. It is said that Japanese warships have repeatedly shelled the Beihai defense forces. On the 24th, the Chinese army also returned fire. The Japanese army was finally unable to land. It is said that the Chinese army has superior fortifications in the Beihai area, and the Guangdong-Guangxi joint defense has strong forces. The self-defense teams in Hepu, Lingshan, Qinxian, and Fangcheng in Guangdong Province have also increased by five large teams, and the local armed forces are also very strong. As for the sea area around Hainan, Japanese warships are now moving erratically. Nine Japanese warships were found near Qiong Island and then sailed away. In addition to the original Japanese warships, three more Japanese warships have been added to Weizhou Island. Eight Japanese warships have also arrived in the Xuwen sea area of the Leizhou Peninsula, most of which are cruisers and destroyers. The Japanese warships have recently dared not gather all the ships in the Qinzhou and Lianzhou sea area, because the French fleet has concentrated in Vietnam to defend Guangzhou Bay, fearing friction with it, so most of them are docked in Xuwen. As for Weizhou Island, although the area is not large, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers have been stationed there in recent days. Most of the local residents have fled to Beihai, and their situation is extremely miserable. Those who have not escaped are forced by the Japanese army to build trenches and bunkers. As for the women, almost all of them have fled.

### Zhejiang Province Stipulates Measures for the Preservation of Documents: Government Assists with Relocation

Jinhua Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Education and Culture Committee, in view of the fact that since the War of Resistance, many public and private collections of books have been lost, including many books related to national culture, academic inventions, and other issues, proposed to the Provincial Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Association to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Collection Committee for Documents of Refugees in the Occupied Areas, as Zhejiang is an important cultural center in the southeast, and the collection and preservation of this type of document is especially important. The Provincial Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Association discussed this issue at its sixth meeting and decided on five points:
 The committee does not need to be established.
 Issue a notice to all counties to pay close attention to all kinds of historically valuable documents.
 If it is inconvenient for private individuals to preserve documents, they can be handed over to the local or provincial library for safekeeping.
 In the event of an incident, the government should assist in the relocation of documents held by private individuals.
 If the Education and Culture Affairs Committee, after investigation, confirms that there are various valuable documents related to history and culture, it can report to the Association and forward it to the Provincial Government for verification.

### Chinese Army Annihilates 300 Japanese Soldiers at the Border of Jiaxing and Haiyan

Jiaxing Correspondence: On the 26th, six Japanese motorboats suddenly passed through a certain Chinese army base at the border of Jiaxing and Haiyan, carrying more than 300 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army and soldiers immediately relied on the terrain on both sides to concentrate their firepower and bombard the Japanese boats. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Japanese soldiers stubbornly resisted while desperately opening the throttles to escape. However, due to the Chinese army and soldiers giving their lives, no Japanese soldier survived in this battle. The Japanese army occupying Jiaxing, because the "January 28th" anniversary was approaching again, and there were widespread rumors that the Chinese army would be active on that day, the Japanese headquarters ordered the soldiers stationed in Jiaxing not to go out without reason, and set up sandbags and barbed wire at various key points, prohibiting the passage of vehicles and horses. Inland river ships were also suspended on that day.

### Japanese Troops Invade Punan, Burning and Killing Terribly

Punan Correspondence: The Japanese army has repeatedly attacked Punan, but they have failed. This time, they have invaded in large numbers, coming from three routes: Minhang, Songjiang, and Pinghu, forming an encirclement on the 25th of this month. The advance units crossed the Huangpu River from Zhujiahang, Huan'an, and other towns on the border of Songjiang and Fengxian counties to search, knocking on doors house by house, and no one was spared. The Punan Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army had received news early on. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they disintegrated into smaller units and used mobile warfare to deal with them. On the morning of the 26th, guided by local people, the Japanese army invaded Ruanxiang Town on the border of Songjiang and Fengxian counties, first strafing with machine guns. There were about 200 people, guarding all sides. The townspeople were unable to escape. The National Salvation Army, ambushing outside the town, saw this situation and immediately launched attacks from all sides. The Japanese army retreated in disarray, and the townspeople were able to take the opportunity to escape. The Japanese army then mobilized three units and rushed into the town with machine guns, conducting a large-scale search. It is said that more than 20 men, women, and children who failed to escape were killed. The most tragic case was the Xia family dyeing workshop, where the father, son, and daughter, unable to abandon their family business, hid in the attic. The Japanese army considered them to be a special operations team and tied them up on the spot, poured kerosene on them, and threw them into a woodpile. The flames spread, turning neighboring houses into ruins. It is estimated that more than 30 shops in the market were destroyed. The Japanese army went to Zhuangjiahang Town overnight. Before the townspeople got up in the morning, they used machine guns to attack the town, forcing men, women, and children to stand on the street in rows of two, interrogating them one by one. They then went to Zhu Liangsheng's house and stabbed Zhu Liangsheng's ten-year-old son to death on the spot. Zhu Liangsheng and his eldest son and three others were tied up by the Japanese and dragged out, and thick lead wires were inserted into their bones, making them appear extremely cruel. Before leaving, they set Zhu's house and the neighboring Han's house on fire. The reason why most of the market houses in the town were preserved this time was that after the Japanese army set the fire, the townspeople desperately tried to put it out, thus preventing the fire from spreading. As a result, only dozens of interconnected rooms of the Zhu and Han families in Henan were destroyed. The Japanese army withdrew from Nanqiao on the 26th.

### Finance: Spot Price Rarely Changes, Fluctuating Between 2020 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot gold dark market saw little fluctuation, hovering around the closing price of last Saturday. However, the range for the whole day was only two yuan, as the public was awaiting speeches from Chamberlain and Hitler, so they were temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude and were unwilling to enter or exit lightly. Although the northern merchants sold off slightly midway, the jewelry merchants did not dump much, so under the purchasing power of the money exchange and securities merchants, the price remained stable. Luk Chuk fell by one yuan, and trading also decreased slightly, with only about 600 taels traded. General sentiment was slightly better than last weekend. Gold jewelry, customs gold, and Sino-British pure gold were all unchanged.

Spot Gold Only Dropped by One Yuan

From the morning, the initial asking price was 2,033 yuan per bar (ten taels), but no deals were made. It wasn't until 9:45 AM that a money exchange, on behalf of a fellow merchant, bought 50 taels of spot gold, and the northern merchants bought 50 taels, at an opening price of 2,020 yuan. Subsequently, the jewelry merchants bought 50 taels from the money exchange, at the same price. In the meantime, news suddenly broke that foreign exchange had weakened slightly after being dumped by Hong Kong Electric and Sassoon, so the price also fell immediately. A money exchange bought 50 taels each from the jewelry merchants and spot gold merchants, both at 18 yuan. At that time, securities and jewelry merchants suddenly came in to buy, so the price rebounded immediately. The securities merchants also bought 50 taels each from the gold and northern merchants at the same price. The jewelry merchants bought 50 taels from a fellow merchant, priced at 20 yuan. Money exchangers traded 50 taels with each other, priced at 19 yuan and 5 jiao. Finally, a gold merchant sold 50 taels to a money exchange, priced at 19 yuan, which was the noon closing price. The afternoon was still uneventful, and trading was sparse. It wasn't until 2:40 PM that money exchangers were seen trading 50 taels with each other, priced at 19 yuan. Subsequently, a gold merchant bought 50 taels from a money exchange, priced at 19 yuan and 5 jiao. After that, because foreign exchange was said to have gradually recovered after being snapped up by foreign firms, buyers were slightly more active. At 3:45 PM, money exchangers were seen trading 30 taels with each other, priced at 20 yuan. At that time, there were still people bidding 20 yuan to buy, but sellers were unwilling to supply, so no deals were made. The evening closing price was 2,020 yuan, a drop of one yuan compared to the previous day. The current selling price of the current number's gold was 2,030 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,015 yuan. The current standard gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no deals were made.

Exchange Rate for Gold Jewelry Unchanged

The exchange rate for gold jewelry remained unchanged, with Da Tong Heng, Lao Qingyun, and others still listing the original price of 205 yuan per tael, and Xin Tong Heng listing 203 yuan, with a purchase price of 197 yuan.

Customs Pure Gold Also Unchanged

The Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese spot gold remained unchanged at 1,214 yuan. The listed customs gold also remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 9 li. Shanghai Standard Gold also remained unchanged at 1,209 yuan, 3 jiao, as a result of London's telegram on the 28th, which stated that British pure gold remained fixed at £7, 8 shillings, and 8.5 pence per ounce.

### Foreign Exchange Reselling Quite Active, Guangzhou Merchants and Money Exchangers Also Start Selling Hong Kong Exchange

The exchange market yesterday was slightly stronger because although foreign firms were buying, banks were more willing to supply, and Hong Kong Electric, Sassoon, and the cotton yarn merchants were all selling. However, there was still little change midway, and transactions were very light. Hong Kong exchange also loosened slightly because money exchangers and Guangzhou merchants were selling heavily.

In the early morning, London large bills, both near and far, were seen rebounding. The New York silver price remained unchanged. The London gold price also remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British currency to the US dollar was up 1.2 li, to the French franc was up 4 centimes, and to Shanghai was flat. The exchange rate of the US dollar to British currency was up 375, to the French franc was up 125, and to Shanghai was down 2 fen. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened with a spot selling price of British exchange at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 4 fen, 3 li, and 7 hao, and US exchange at 16.25 yuan, both the same as last Saturday's noon closing price. After opening, foreign firms bought British gold at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 4 fen, 3 li, and 7 hao, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan. However, because banks were still willing to supply, the situation lacked change. The HSBC listing was revealed as before. The silver balancing tax was revealed to be up 1.5 fen. After that, Hong Kong Electric and the British merchant Sassoon sold British gold at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 5 fen, 9 li, 3 hao, and 7 si, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan. Most of it was bought by Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, and American Express. In addition, money exchangers also followed suit and sold Hong Kong exchange at 56.125 yuan. Moreover, it was difficult for foreign banks to buy, so the process gradually loosened. The noon closing selling price of banks was slightly looser than the morning opening price, with British gold at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 5 fen, 9 li, 3 hao, and 7 si, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan.

In the afternoon, the cotton yarn merchants dumped US exchange at 16.3125 yuan, while foreign firms bought British gold at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 4 fen, 3 li, and 7 hao. Foreign banks also engaged in both buying and selling, so the situation remained unchanged. Later, although Guangzhou merchants sold Hong Kong exchange at 55.875 yuan, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, American Express, and others were still eagerly buying, so the underlying trend tightened slightly. By the evening closing, the selling price of banks was British exchange at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 5 fen, 9 li, 3 hao, and 7 si, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan, the same as the noon closing price. As a result, British currency was 0.015625 harder and US currency was 0.03125 cheaper than last Saturday. Hong Kong exchange was also up 25. The following is a record of the transactions made during the day: British Exchange (Calculated at 1 Yuan National Currency), US Exchange (Calculated at 100 Yuan National Currency), Hong Kong Exchange (Calculated at 100 Yuan National Currency)

### Discount Rate Stops Rising

Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts stopped rising and retreated slightly. The rate per 1,000 yuan was still generally fluctuating between 36 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen, and 37 yuan. At noon, it was 36 yuan and 5 jiao. In the afternoon, it was 36 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, 2 jiao and 5 fen lower than last Saturday.

### Foreign Currency Trends Stabilize

Last Saturday, British pure gold was unchanged, and the British-US exchange rate rose by 1.25. Yesterday, the foreign exchange market had a balanced supply and demand, and the trend was stable. Spot gold trading was still strong, and the market price fluctuated narrowly, showing a hovering trend. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds and gold notes, were traded slightly, and the market price fluctuated slightly, but most were unchanged. Guild transactions were rare. Only Chang Tai sold Heng Mao 50 pounds of British gold notes. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds fell by 5 fen, British gold notes rose by 2 fen, US gold pounds rose by 1 jiao, US gold notes fell by 2 li, Hong Kong notes fell by 1 li, Italian gold notes fell by 5 li, and all other currencies were unchanged.

### Securities Public Bond Market Conditions Suddenly Difficult to Recover Northern Sales Impact

Securities in the after-hours market: Yesterday's market conditions, after a two-day market suspension, were more active. The trend was still unable to rise under high pressure. The outflow of spot goods from the sellers continued to come from various sources. In addition to the continued selling of Tenth Number, Tongkang Number and Dafeng Number also tended to sell. As a result, rumors arose in the market. Although they were groundless and fabricated out of thin air, the extremely fragile sentiment could no longer withstand another attack. Some said that there would be new reforms in interest rates in the future, and some said that the number of winning tickets in the subsequent lottery would be reduced. Such absurd talk was based on the fact that the seventh lottery would increase the number of tickets for the five types of unified public bonds in accordance with the original plan, especially Type A. In fact, those in North China who held these public bonds did have difficulties. Legal tender could not circulate smoothly, and there was the unexpected misfortune of price suppression. Therefore, a large number of spot goods arrived in Shanghai for sale. In addition, the selling of Tenth Number had not stopped for several days, so the several rises were eventually suppressed and fell. Starting today, the market price should be calculated by deducting 3 yuan in interest, and there is a proposal to issue 500 million new public bonds. The future may be difficult to recover the depressed sentiment for the time being. Yesterday, at the beginning of the morning, retail investors seemed to have an appetite, and the market price slowly strengthened. In the middle, Tenth Number, Thirty-first Number, and Tongkang Number suddenly surged, and the market price fell in a straight line. At the close, Lemao and Changtai Number bought in, and it recovered slightly, but it had already fallen by 78 cents to more than 1 yuan. In the afternoon, trading was thinner, and the trend was still good first and then small. At first, Xie Da bought in and the market sentiment was very strong, followed by Qiafeng Number, Hengde Number, and Lianhe Number selling one after another, and then it went downstream, a few cents smaller than in the morning. As a result, the decline continued across the board, ranging from 9 cents to 1 yuan and 7 cents. The total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock market conditions: Recently, due to more buyers, trading has been more active. Jiangnan Paper Company stocks with a face value of 20 yuan, which had not been inquired about for a long time, were traded for 500 to 600 shares at a price of 2 yuan and 35 cents. Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded for 50 shares at a price of 6 yuan and 50 cents, it is said.

Bituminous coal lumps and fines: High-quality goods are still in demand exceeding supply. Various factories are more eager to store them due to the end of the lunar year. The market has secretly shown a strong trend, and the price is slowly rising. Yesterday, a certain company opened up hundreds of tons of Australian coal, calculated at 42 yuan per ton for screened lumps, 40 yuan for run-of-mine coal, and 41 yuan for fines, delivered from the warehouse, with additional handling fees. However, the inventory is not much and will soon be sold out, it is said.

Economic Data

### Golden World

Since the world's military buildup and active preparations for war, gold has been the unanimous target of government officials and civilians in various countries. Although gold cannot satisfy hunger or keep out the cold, currency scholars generally believe that its monetary status will eventually be demoted. However, in the current capitalist world, the qualification of "money is omnipotent" has not disappeared, so national governments hoard it to maintain their foreign exchange and clear the price of imported munitions. People are afraid that paper money will depreciate during wartime, so they hoard it to preserve their wealth. Therefore, although the gold reserves used for currency in various countries have increased sharply in recent years, they have not increased as quickly as the world's gold production. For example, the world's gold production has increased by an average of 1,100 metric tons per year in recent years; from 1933 to 1938, it should have increased by as much as 6,600 metric tons. However, the gold used for currency held by various countries in the same period increased by only 4,000 metric tons. It can be seen that the amount of gold hoarded by the public in the past six years has increased by another 2,600 metric tons.

According to the latest issue of the FedcralReserve Bulletin magazine: At the end of 1933, the total value of gold used for world currency was 13,826 million old US dollars; it has increased sharply year by year since then; by the end of September last year, it had increased to 21,367 million old US dollars. However, Japan has sharply reduced from 212 million old US dollars to 97 million old US dollars (this number is still based on Japanese official statistics, and it has actually entered the era of no reserves); while China has increased from 5 million old US dollars to 9 million old US dollars (this number should not include other gold reserves). It is worth noting that Japan's currency gold reserves were 273 million old US dollars at the end of 1936, reduced to 154 million at the end of 1937, and further reduced to 97 million old US dollars in September 1938. In other words, in the first nine months of last year, it sharply reduced by 57 million old US dollars. Since the outbreak of the August 13 war last autumn, Japan has repeatedly exported its domestic gold reserves, and even revalued its reserve prices to facilitate exports. Now it is even openly exporting part of its last gold reserves. However, in the same period, the gold reserves held by the Chinese government increased from 5 million old US dollars to 9 million old US dollars, and remained unchanged until the end of September last year. In contrast, Japan's weakness is obvious. Moreover, according to recent estimates from various parties, China's domestic silver reserves, even at present, still amount to 900 million to 1 billion yuan. This is not included in the above number. The estimated numbers of the magazine are listed below. (Unit: million old US dollars X is an approximate calculation)

### Yarn Flowers Under the Huge Sales of Shenxin, Cotton Yarn Bulls are Disheartened, Each Brand Falls by Six, Seven, or Eight Yuan

The yarn market, which had been hovering around the peak of 400 yuan for a week, suddenly declined yesterday. The real reason is that the spot yarn sales market is lacking, not as prosperous as it was a few days ago. In the past, the financial circles were relaxed, and there was no transaction to be done at present, so they had a lot of activity in cotton cloth and cotton yarn, and they were very interested in it. Therefore, they searched endlessly in the market. With this impetus, the market rose. Unexpectedly, the actual demand, except for a slight need in the South, other regions were not interested. In addition, Shenxin Factory wholesale opened 5,000 packages, the price was 395 yuan, and the delivery was in February and March. Banks accounted for one-third of the orders, and the rest were taken by counterparts and customers. Although the general opinion is that the opening price is too high, calculated based on the cost of raw materials, the factory's profit is still 60 to 70 yuan per piece. However, with such a large amount of chips to remedy in the market, the bulls were disheartened and closed their positions, and the market suddenly became tired. However, a certain bank still came to eat in small amounts.

Checking the situation of spot yarn in the early morning, the opening price of the customer was not strong, only the Shantou region came to inquire. The market said that the factory had opened a large number of futures. The views of the bulls and bears differed. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 2 yuan lower than the previous day, at 398 yuan. The counterpart entered 5 packages. After a while, a crowd of retail sellers gathered, and the market opened and went down. Finally, the price of Shuangma was 394.5 yuan, and the price of stack list was 393 yuan. As a result, the statistics of transactions in the morning were 1,115 packages, and the afternoon transactions on the previous day were 725 packages. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 6 yuan lower than the previous day, Shuangdiqiu was 8 yuan lower, Tejinyu was 6 yuan lower, Tiannv was 6.5 yuan lower, and Baifeiting was 7 yuan lower. Also, today, 60 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai, 30 pieces to Tianjin, 610 pieces to Shantou, and 200 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of each region purchased is listed on the left: 790 for counterparts, 30 for Wenzhou, 295 for Shantou, and the total is 215.

Previous Day's Transactions

Shantou 40 Hong Kong 240 Tianjin 30 Counterparts 300 Sichuan 75 Total 725 Total transactions for two days 1,840 packages

The yarn market in Japan is extremely short-squeezed, so the market price is very strong. The spot yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 335 yuan, and the spot yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is 328 yuan. Futures prices are still able to be transacted, with the squeeze not yet subsided. The amount of transactions in January Piqiu is said to have been mediated by a broker, and the storm is expected to pass peacefully without any problems.

Shenxin Buys Foreign Cotton Every Day

Foreign cotton market prices: The US spot cotton market is extremely narrow, but spot cotton transactions are still good. Most of the bulls are swapping distant months. Only a portion of the shorts are temporarily waiting to see what happens because the government has not yet announced the legislation on the cotton industry and the sale of loan cotton. Yesterday, US cotton rose by 2 pounds, India's forecast rose by half a rupee, and Egypt rose by more than 14 pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate was firmer, and the cotton prices all rose when converted into legal tender. US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 20 cents per picul, Indian cotton rose by more than 10 cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by 50 cents.

The local foreign cotton market was quieter yesterday due to the decline in yarn prices. Indian cotton sold the most, because coarse yarn has been selling well recently. Shenxin has been trading in foreign cotton almost every day. Yesterday, it also entered 200 packages of Indian cotton, and Tongyi also entered 500 packages of Indian cotton. The transaction amount and price of yesterday are recorded separately below.

Transaction Amount

### Lighter Flower Selling Price Not Loose, Still Opens at 70 Yuan Exchange

The local cotton business is flat and uninspired, but the market is as stable as ever. The factory has a slight appetite, but large transactions are extremely lacking. Tongyi Factory entered 1,000 packages of lighter flower, and the price is still expensive at 70 yuan. Shenxin Factory entered 400 pieces of Tianjin fine velvet, and the other factories did nothing. The flower companies feel lonely for buying and selling because the lunar New Year is approaching, and they are preparing to close the procedure. However, various factories are still actively purchasing foreign cotton. It is said that Langong cotton, which is equivalent to lighter flower, is priced at only 61.5 yuan, which is much cheaper. The arrival of goods from Subei is still considerable. A total of 5,198 packages of Tonghua arrived on the 28th, 29th, and 30th. 327 packages of Changyinsha flower also arrived. Also, 190 pieces came from Xiaoligang, and 510 pieces came from Beisha. Today, 100 pieces will be exported to Hong Kong. The opening price and transaction amount of spot cotton are listed on the left.

### Piece Goods Eastern White Goods Rise Without End

A Certain Big Company Clears Piqiu Transactions, Stalled National Cloth, The Rising Wind is Also Sharp, This Street Handles Spring and Summer Goods

National cloth has risen unanimously. Yingchang Factory's various grades of coarse cloth and fine twill have risen by 10 cents per piece. Lunghang Factory's printed satin, floral cloth, serge, tribute satin, and tribute damask have risen by 10 cents. Blue cloth has risen by 20 cents. Huachang Factory's coarse cloth has risen by 10 cents. Fine cloth and fine twill have risen by 12 cents. The prices of colored cloth, printed cloth, and bleached cloth have all risen by 10 to 30 cents. Shenxin Factory opened Fuguifei cloth for March at a price of 12.5 yuan and Fuguifei twill at a price of 11.75 yuan. The total amount is about 500 pieces. Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth is priced at 12.75 yuan and was purchased for more than 20 pieces of spot goods by the Guangdong region. The Shantou and Hong Kong regions added 50 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, Chunniu, Aizi, and other brands. More than 80 boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and bleached twill. The Wenzhou and Ningbo regions added more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, 84 cloth, fine twill, and fine cloth from factories such as Yihe and Neiyi. More than 190 boxes of blue cloth, factory cloth, colored twill, and printed cloth. The wholesale shops in this street also have a healthy appetite. Lunghang, Central, and Hengfeng printed cloth, blue cloth, Guangxie, woolen cloth, and serge from various factories have been traded for nearly 200 boxes. They are also very careful to search for and purchase various stocks of spring and summer sales products such as foreign yarn, poplin, and ramie yarn. The transaction amount is huge. The Tianjin region in the north purchased 60 to 70 boxes of Tiao Su Fu silk, blue cloth, and woolen cloth. The Yantai region purchased nearly 100 boxes of yarn, serge, colored twill, and Li cloth. The Sichuan-Yunnan region and overseas Siam and Singapore are also constantly purchasing goods.

Eastern cloth white goods are rising in a straight line without end. The bidding for fine cloth and fine twill was inconsistent and chaotic yesterday morning. The market situation has changed greatly. It turns out that a certain big company has been buying long and selling short at ordinary times, and the amount is very large. Now it cannot be compensated and should be cleared. Dozens of counterparts have been indirectly and directly implicated. This has caused the leather ball business in the market to stop invisibly. The spot goods transactions outside the market and the purchase by dyeing factories in this street are only about 1,000 pieces, but the futures orders are very large, and the price is rising step by step. The market price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 12.25 yuan per piece, and 12.35 yuan in the afternoon. The opening price of Rainbow Ball was 12.3 to 4 yuan. Feiyu 11 to 12 yuan, 1 to 3.5 to 50 cents. Five Blessings 12.15 yuan. Trumpet 11.9 to 12 yuan Blue Shuangyu 11.85 to 95 cents. Various foreign firms have ordered more than 2,000 pieces of fine cloth for February, March, and April. The Tianjin region accounts for half of them, and the rest are opened by counterparts. Fine twill is quoted even higher, but it has not been opened. The selling price of spot goods is 25 cents higher per piece than on Saturday, and the fine twill is 25 to 30 cents higher. The hoarders have a strong intention, and the trend is quite tight. On Saturday, the Tianjin region bulked 100 boxes of Four Gentlemen Serge at a price of 39.25 cents per yard.

Today, 140 pieces of piece goods will be exported to Yantai, 50 pieces to Beihai, 150 pieces to Shantou, and 10 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Silk Tea Silk Path Alone is Good

Yesterday, there was no market in New York, and the rise and fall in Yokohama were minimal, but generally firm. The spot price was 880 yuan, down 3 yuan, and the forward price was 866 yuan, up 1 yuan. Locally, the foreign firms are still lifeless, but the users are as enthusiastic as before. White factory ordinary B word 10-22 strips, silk factory demand is very strong, the silk price has risen to 1440 yuan, the general sentiment is to hope to 1500 yuan, recently the foreign firms into the stomach and the user market price, has been more than 80 yuan apart, the three ports of England, France and the United States silk delivery, the forecast in the coming weeks, or will still be difficult to expand, yesterday the Indian foreign firms into the reeling meridian ten loads, the price of 690 yuan, compared to a week ago has risen 20 yuan, the user to do 40 loads, the market is very brisk said.

### Foreign Green Tea Needs Are Very Strong

Rough Tea Prices Soar, Costs Are Huge

The local foreign tea market has seen very little trading in the past week, but foreign firms are in great need of high-end goods, so they are buying at high prices. However, the market's stock is scarce, and the supply is not enough to meet the demand. In the past week, only more than 300 boxes of high-end Zhenmei were traded, and the market was quite stable. The other low-end varieties were difficult to choose, resulting in a market without a price. It is heard that the local tea factories Yuanli, Sanyuan Yichengxiang, Dachan, etc., have successively transported large amounts of rough tea, and have recently started to rush to produce tea for the market. It is heard that the price of each load of rough tea must be more than 60 to 70 yuan, and the cost is quite huge. It is expected that the market will see a rising trend.

### Grains Wheat Production Price is High, Flour Sales Are Flat As Before

Yesterday was the beginning of the week for flour, and the spot flour market was trading normally. The reason is that the retail sales continued to decrease, and although the North and South regions had a finger in the pie, they were scattered. Moreover, the sales of large households in North China were quiet, and the factory was firm in selling because there was not much production at present. As a result, more than 20,000 bags of various brands of flour were traded at the original price. In addition to about 8,000 bags in this street's retail sales, the majority were from the Hebei and Shandong regions, followed by the Shantou and Min regions. The price of No. 2 flour factory's brand car boat brand was 4.8 yuan across the board, and the price of Green Hero was 4.45 yuan. It is also heard that the market price of foreign flour is 5 yuan per bag for spot goods, and the price for booking is about 4.67 yuan, but there is no transaction for the time being.

Today, 5,000 bags of flour will be exported to Tianjin, 4,500 bags to Yantai, 1,000 bags of bran, and 4,000 bags of flour to Shantou.

The source of wheat yesterday was not lonely, and about 8,900 bags arrived. Among them, 350 bags came from Xingang. The newly arrived goods still had high production prices, and the owners were insistent, but the factory's appetite was not very welcome. The reason is that since the current factories have been importing foreign wheat, they pay more attention to the selection of the quality of domestic wheat. Therefore, the market has been brewing for many days, and it has only risen slightly. The unified market sold four kinds of wheat from Jiangbei, Wuhu, Chuzhou, and Puzhen, totaling 7,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin and Fufeng in half each. The market price has risen by several points compared with last week, with the highest being 6.55 yuan, it is said.

### Thick Japonica Rice Arrives More 5,000 Bags Transferred to Tianjin

Yesterday, the source of domestic rice arrived at No. 6, with nearly 8,000 bags of car wheel dumplings, of which thick japonica rice accounted for the majority. Therefore, at this time when the outlets in this street and hoarders are sluggish, it is even more difficult to gain a foothold. However, the selling parties have different ideas, some are willing to sell, and some are still unwilling to sell, so the market is chaotic. As a result, the price of Changxi region goods fell by more than 10 cents, while the intention of Sutong region was firmer, only tired by several points. However, the source of thin rice is even smaller, and the prices are recognized as having fallen through, and they are all instructed to defend. The market is reluctantly stable. Duyang Jian, Pu Jian, and Bianyuan are also devalued by 10 cents and a few cents, respectively. Yesterday, 5,400 bags of rice came from Hong Kong and were transferred to Tianjin.

### Middle and Secondary Ke Xian Drops Sharply by 10 to 20 Cents

Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian was endless. Although new transactions have been mostly stopped, there are still a large number of stocks to be transported, and some Ke vendors still plan to move small amounts due to the deposit relationship in the area. Many scattered vendors are depreciating prices in the market to get rid of them, so the middle and secondary Wu Xian fell to about 9.5 yuan, which is 10 to 20 cents lower than the previous market. However, high-quality goods are still trying to maintain firmness, so the market yesterday was only 5 to 6 cents lower, it is said.

### Yellow Beans High Quality is Extremely Scarce Market Price Moves Forward Step by Step Bean Cakes Transported to Shantou and Hong Kong

The yellow bean market continued to see upward promotion. At the moment, only Chongming beans are available in the market, and they are constantly arriving, but they are also decreasing day by day, especially high-quality goods are extremely scarce, so the market price of middle and low-quality goods is becoming more firm and expensive. Yesterday, the lowest price of Chongming sand yellow had been opened to 7.41 yuan, and the highest price was still opened to 7.55 yuan. Although the price has not moved, in terms of quality, there must be a difference of 4 to 5 cents. Pinghu Du beans rose by more than 10 cents compared to last week, and more than 200 bags were traded at a price of 9 yuan and 9.2 yuan, which were handled by this street and Xiaoluzong region. 300 bags of Wuhu beans were opened at a price of 7.5 yuan. This bean is most suitable for the outlet of this street. Chongming sand yellow was purchased by this street, Xiamen, Xinghua, and other three regions for more than 700 sentences.

Today, 930 bags of soybeans will be transported to Shantou and 150 bags to Hong Kong.

Also, today, 2,000 pieces of large soybean cakes and 2,110 pieces of small soybean cakes will be transported to Shantou.

There will also be 380 bags of raw peanuts transported to Shantou and 100 bags to Hong Kong.

Yesterday, 4,000 pieces of bean oil came from Dalian, and 1,100 pieces of raw oil came from Qingdao.

### Sugar Market Dutch Coarse White Falls Frequently

Yesterday, Dutch coarse white continued to decline. The association's price for spot goods of 24 Dutch coarse white outside the warehouse was 24.1 yuan, 24.3 yuan in this warehouse, and 24.5 yuan for Dayu Qianmai, all down 20 cents. The decline in transit goods was even greater, falling into the 16 yuan range and traded at 15.9 yuan, a drop of nearly 1 yuan compared to the highest price, and 40 cents less than the previous day. The trend seems difficult to stabilize. Taikoo Chebai is still holding the original price, but there are few transactions. The source of new domestic sugar is still lacking. It is found that only 35 bags of white sugar arrived on the Yunnan round the day before yesterday, and according to Quanzhou telegrams, the land price has risen by 3 yuan, and only more than 400 bags of goods were transported. The opening price of the number plate is also small. Dozens of bags of ordinary Shantou red goods were traded at a price of 14.6 yuan. Also, yesterday, 1,100 bags of sugar came from Shantou.

### North and South Goods Red Qiantong Low Price Causes Hoarding

Ordinary red qiantong, because it is not a sales season, the lowest price has reached 245 yuan. The highest price must be more than 40 yuan, and the decline has reached one-third, which can be said to be extremely low and has attracted much attention. Gradually, there are buyers hoarding, and the price has rebounded slightly, opening to 27 yuan. Yesterday, the market price for high-quality goods had to be 30 yuan, but according to the land price, it is still difficult to calculate with the difficulty of transportation and high external expenses.

### Newly Built Mushrooms Source is Not Sustained

Since the new goods of Fujian mushrooms have been launched, the arrival of goods has been interrupted due to the fact that the production area has not yet flourished. The needs of various regions are very strong. It is found that the local stock is extremely thin, so the goods in the hands of the industry have been tightened unanimously. It is heard that the Hong Kong region is handling it, such as the new mushroom market asking for 225 yuan to 220 yuan, and the old mushrooms are also brought high to 190 yuan, and both need cash, which is expected to be traded immediately.

### Imports and Exports Coming and Going Goods are Quite Strong

Xiamen also has a large batch of honey tangerines, totaling more than 1,500 pieces, and Shantou tangerines also have 380 pieces, and 2,500 pieces of kiln goods. Yesterday's imports, today, 4,000 boxes of kerosene will go to Shantou.

400 tons of foreign paper and 40 barrels of pigments came from Italy. There were also 200 tons of steel concentrate transferred to Osaka. 140 pieces of tobacco leaves came from Ningbo. 550 pieces of tea powder came from Hong Kong. 4,000 bags of fertilizer powder from Hong Kong were transferred to Yantai.

### Hardware Green Lead Iron Sales Suddenly Rise

Green lead iron has recently become more expensive due to the high prices of steel from Huisitong, so users have mostly switched to selling it. The market situation has been extraordinarily busy in recent days. Tianjin's thermos bottle factories, cigarette companies, can factories, and other factories need it frequently. Although it is the end of the lunar year, the transaction still reaches a huge 5600 boxes. The market is rising step by step with supply not meeting demand. The price per box is sold to 43.5 yuan, which is another 50 cents higher than the previous day. The double joint market is priced at 45 yuan, which is also 1 yuan higher than before. A survey shows that the stock in Shanghai is limited, and no new goods have been shipped. The holders are highly motivated and unwilling to easily let go, so it is expected that the market situation will not ease in the future. According to overseas pricing, the latest price is 6 gold yuan (200 pounds per box), which is also half a yuan better than before, and there is a lack of recent road goods. It is expected that the market situation in the future will not tend to fall.

### Medical and Pharmaceutical Advertisements That Exploit the Weaknesses of the World

— Wang Qizhang

In the latest issue of this publication, Song Ke and his associates have written a masterpiece titled "The Public's Understanding of Exaggerated Medical and Pharmaceutical Advertisements," which is as powerful as Chen Lin's proclamation, enough to cure Cao Cao's headache. In this quiet, isolated island, one cannot but feel a sense of a lone voice in an empty valley. From this, we know that the righteousness of the world has not completely disappeared! I read six or seven kinds of Chinese and foreign newspapers every day, and I always feel that the famous newspapers at sea occupy huge pages for medical and pharmaceutical advertisements, which cannot but attract people to browse. But if we examine it, the medical advertisements that occupy the most space are for venereal diseases, and the pharmaceutical advertisements that occupy the most space are for tonics. We know that the business acumen of the medical and pharmaceutical industry has reached a high level. Why? Because venereal diseases are secret, and patients are often reluctant to seek doctors they know well and reveal their secrets. Therefore, the so-called doctors take advantage of this weakness and elaborate on various symptoms, so that patients can compare their hidden troubles and swallow the bait, and then their plan will succeed. This is why advertisements for venereal diseases are large, numerous, and tirelessly detailed! Tonics are like medicines but not medicines. There is no possibility of immediate effect, and there is a need for long-term use. Whether the medicine is effective or not is not proven; whether the body needs it or not is not asked. In short, to put it all together, the medicine is omnipotent, and everyone can take it. Over time, it seems that there is an unexpected effect. And thinking of those who take tonics, most of them are economically well-off, so in addition to food supplements, they continue with medicinal supplements. Once they try it, why not take it for a long time? The rich mostly think like this. This is why advertisements for tonics are large, numerous, and all-encompassing! Alas! The revelation of the medical and pharmaceutical advertising policy is Song Wang's intention, Song Wang's wish.

Popular Medical Talks

### One of Random Talks on Typhoid Fever (Continued)

— Zhang Kecheng

Is it Typhoid Fever?

The disease Typhoid Fever has existed since ancient times. Therefore, the ancient medical books have long recorded this disease name. However, unfortunately, according to Dr. Zhang Zihe's detailed analysis in his book "Discussion on Chinese Medicine Science," the "Treatise on Typhoid Fever" does not actually discuss typhoid fever at all, but rather influenza. This completely overturns the reliance on old medical knowledge. Therefore, it's better for us experts to talk about typhoid fever.

Fever is a symptom, and many diseases can cause fever. Typhoid fever is one of the fever-causing diseases. Therefore, typhoid fever also has the symptom of fever. At the same time, because fever is an obvious symptom, it is easily noticed by patients. Also, the dread of typhoid fever is deeply rooted in people's minds. Thus, when people experience fever, they suspect this disease. However, as mentioned above, fever is not limited to typhoid fever. It would be very presumptuous to determine whether it is typhoid fever based solely on fever. Although everyone is now measuring body temperature, they are not filling out temperature charts and are constantly using diaphoretic drugs, making the situation even more confusing and unclear.

Since the introduction of new medical knowledge, everyone also knows that the pulse of typhoid fever does not increase in proportion to body temperature. This seems to provide another basis for judgment. However, the slow pulse of typhoid fever is only seen in adults. As for children, young neurotic women, and elderly people with arteriosclerosis, their pulse rates are often not slow. This point is also unreliable.

The Diazo reaction is also a method for early diagnosis of typhoid fever. However, in mild cases of typhoid fever, many show negative results. Furthermore, diseases that show a positive Diazo reaction are not limited to typhoid fever. Even if one understands this method, one is still at a loss.

Leukopenia is also an important symptom of typhoid fever. However, many infectious diseases also show this symptom. Especially in children, lymphocytes are naturally more numerous than in adults. Compared to adults, the reduction may not be significant.

Serum reaction (Widal test) can be said to be an important method for determining typhoid fever. However, first, this positive reaction must occur after the second week of the illness, especially reaching its highest level in the third week. However, doctors cannot wait for this positive reaction to appear before prescribing medication. So, although it is a good method, it cannot be used for emergencies. Second, this positive reaction is also seen in other diseases, especially miliary tuberculosis. If one makes a mistake, the harm is far more serious than a slight error in measurement.

Bacterial detection. This is the most reliable and early method to obtain good results. Because the pathogenic bacteria of typhoid fever appear in the blood in the early stages. The more time that passes, the higher the detection rate. Therefore, if you want to determine whether it is typhoid fever early, this method is excellent.

As for relying on tongue coating, mental state, appetite, and appearance to judge, not only is it not permitted in terms of time, but it also has no great value in reality. From this perspective, diagnosing typhoid fever is probably not an easy task!

Common Knowledge of Treatment

### The Greatest Attention in the Treatment of Nervous Breakdown

— Wang Yugang

The severity of nervous breakdown in the present era can be inferred from the proportion of outpatient cases, the proportion of inquiry cases, and the proportion of drug advertisements. It is rampant. This is not just a medical problem, which makes people in the medical field feel worried, feel that his disease type will become more and more evil in the future, and the harm to the future of the country and the nation is very great. Even people in the education field are aware that he is a current problem for students, and want to resist this crazy tide. Therefore, there is a gradual trend of advocating sex education. I have received too many letters asking about this disease and treatment methods for many years. To avoid the trouble of answering them one by one, I published a booklet on self-treatment of nervous breakdown.

Its nature is divided into two major categories: one is a state of hypersensitivity, that is, a state of excitement, and the other is a state of sluggishness, that is, a state of paralysis. The distinction between the two is not always clearly and unchangeably. Generally speaking, the latter is the successor of the former, so it is a matter of time, that is, a matter of degree. However, the difference between these two symptoms is very obvious. The former is like being prone to impulsiveness, being prone to excitement, premature ejaculation and spermatorrhea, etc. The latter is like lack of pleasure, often feeling tired, weakened erection, or impotence, etc. For these different symptoms, the treatment methods must be different. If you prescribe medicine at will and mistakenly believe in its efficacy, it is like adding fuel to the fire. It is not only useless, but also increases the suffering. This is what I have felt and said in the past. The most and greatest mistake is the abuse of endocrine preparations of the gonads. According to the patient's complaint, it is premature ejaculation.

Insomnia, irritability, etc., when asked about previous treatments, they said that they had been injected with "Sibao Ming" several times, which was not only ineffective, but even more severe. Using this treatment for this disease, isn't it like adding fuel to the fire? This kind of diagnosis is not uncommon. It is really the temptation of the current "era of endocrine treatment" to abuse "Sibao Ming" as a panacea for nervous breakdown and "914". However, if "914" is not used properly, there will be no future troubles. If "Sibao Ming" is not used properly, then there will be unstable results.

Pharmaceutical Knowledge

### Scientific Chinese Medicine

— Zhou Mengbai

Although Chinese medicine has the theory of cold, heat, warm, cool, rising, descending, floating, and sinking, these are all to cater to the mysterious principles of Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements. However, the effectiveness of Chinese medicine in treating diseases cannot be denied. For example, Pinellia ternata relieves vomiting, Ephedra sinica induces sweating, apricot kernels treat coughs, and rhubarb causes diarrhea. These are all real results. How can it relieve vomiting, induce sweating, treat coughs, and cause diarrhea? It is not known at all. This is knowing that it is so, but not knowing why. Now, if we want to know why, we must use some scientific organization and research. For example, use botany to recognize its genus, use pharmacognosy to identify its structure, use chemistry to analyze its properties, and use pharmacology to test its physiological functions and efficacy. Prepare a systematic report for doctors to use in clinical practice. In this way, not only can the existing efficacy be confirmed, but new efficacies are often discovered. However, this organization and research work requires sufficient funding and new medical and pharmaceutical talents with research experience, and a considerable period of time. It is not about roughly manufacturing various mild medicines of unknown nature, catering to a little bit of new medical and pharmaceutical knowledge that is still under research and discussion, and using fairy tale-like advertising techniques, to tell the public: this is a special medicine for a certain disease, this is a new medicine improved by scientific methods. Just like the medicines on the market recently that are not produced by medical professionals, deceiving themselves and others, they are really moths in the scientific community and harmful horses in the medical community. Now, in order to provide pharmaceutical manufacturers with something to follow and drug users with a standard, Chinese medicines that have been studied by people, whose properties have been clearly understood, and whose effects have been confirmed, are all based on academic theory and have become facts, and some have been included in the pharmacopoeia. Excerpted here, it can add to the general public's health knowledge; I think it is also a method of advocating the scientification of Chinese medicine. However, there may be omissions in the saying, I hope that medical and pharmaceutical colleagues can come forward and teach it. (To be continued)

Disease Prevention Knowledge

### Simple Method of Disinfection in Infectious Disease Homes (Part 1)

— Zhu Yanggao

Since last year, epidemics have been constantly prevalent. In addition, the island is densely populated, and the infection is even worse. In order to prevent any eventuality, we must pay attention to the disinfection of sick homes. Disinfection is originally common sense. However, if you want to implement it, you must also study the method to be effective. Otherwise, it is just empty talk, that is, perfunctory, and there is nothing to add to the facts.

Disinfection of sick homes can be divided into two parts: clinical disinfection and final disinfection. Both are carried out at the same time to be effective.

(1) Clinical disinfection

Clinical disinfection means immediate disinfection. Regardless of the patient's excrement, daily necessities, and other objects, if they have had contact with the patient, they are all considered to be infected with germs. Therefore, disinfection must be carried out at any time to prevent the spread of germs.

(A) Disinfection of sputum, nasal mucus, nasal foam, oral saliva, mouth foam, mouthwash, vomit, feces, blood, pus, ulcerous rot, skin scabs and desquamated skin, etc. Those that can be wiped with paper can be burned immediately. Otherwise, first put them in a container containing disinfectant, so that they have at least two hours of contact. At the same time, pay attention to the entire object to be disinfected being immersed and covered by the disinfectant. Now, two cheap and easy-to-obtain disinfectants are introduced below: lime milk, the preparation method is to slowly add two parts of clear water to one part of fresh lime powder and mix well; for example, add three parts of water to one peck of fresh lime powder, a 3% carbolic acid solution, which can be purchased from a pharmacy. However, it often freezes in winter. You can put the medicine bottle in water to dissolve it, take out three cubic centimeters, and add one hundred cubic centimeters of water.

(B) Disinfection methods for tea and rice utensils (cups, bowls, chopsticks, spoons, etc.), washing utensils (washbasins, mouthwash cups, toothbrushes, towels, bath tubs, foot tubs, etc.), books, newspapers, toys, clothes and bedding, curtains, table cloths, etc. are also very simple. Those that can be boiled, such as bowls, cups, and clothes, should be boiled (boil for another fifteen minutes after boiling). For objects that cannot be put in water, except for books and toys, which can be burned, immerse them in a 1% formalin solution for two hours (formalin concentrated solution is available in pharmacies and is not expensive). For woolen items, leather, and rubber products, you can also spray this solution on them, brush them with a brush, and then dry them in the sun. The debris swept up on the floor of the sick room can be burned. For the disinfection of wooden furniture such as tables, desks, benches, and chairs, you can use a 3% carbolic acid diluted solution to wipe them.

(C) A washbasin containing 3% carbolic acid solution must be prepared in each sick room for temporary hand washing and other disinfection purposes. Family members or others who have been in contact with the patient must disinfect the body parts that have been touched, and then wash them with hot water and soap for five minutes.

### Three Foreign Ships Seized and Sailed to Qingdao, Yongzhen has been Released, Left Qingdao for Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Haida and Hava have not been Released, Consuls of Britain and Norway Decided to Continue Negotiations —Kailin Sailed to Fuyu Yesterday and was Forced to Return on the Same Ship—

The three foreign ships Haida, Yongzhen, and Hava, which operate between Shanghai and Fuyu, were seized by Japanese warships at Yanghekou on the morning of the 27th and forced to sail to Qingdao. After the consuls of Britain and Norway made serious representations to the Japanese side yesterday, the Yongzhen was released after negotiations with the British naval authorities and left Qingdao for Shanghai at 8:30 yesterday morning. The British Kailin Marler sailed to Fuyu a few days ago, but was blocked by Japanese warships and returned on the same ship yesterday morning. Foreigners are extremely angry about this. The following are the details of the situation investigated by the reporter of the Modern News Agency:

British and Norwegian Consuls Telegraphed for Negotiations

The three foreign ships that were forced to sail to Qingdao by the Japanese side, Yongzhen, belongs to British merchants, and Haida and Hava belong to Norwegian merchants. After the incident occurred, the shipping companies reported to the British and Norwegian consuls in Shanghai respectively, requesting serious negotiations to demand their release as soon as possible. The consuls of the two countries telegraphed their consuls in Qingdao yesterday morning to negotiate with the Japanese side nearby. Yesterday afternoon, according to the report received from the Qingdao Consulate, the case was protested to the Japanese side, but they shirked responsibility to the Qingdao Customs authorities. Therefore, the negotiations have not been successful. It is said that the British and Norwegian consulates will continue to file strong protests.

Yongzhen First Released and Left Qingdao for Shanghai

According to the reporter of the Modern News Agency's inquiry with the Yongli Shipping Company yesterday, in addition to the British Consulate's negotiations with the Japanese side after the Yongzhen was detained, they also telegraphed the British naval authorities stationed in Qingdao to seriously negotiate with the responsible person of the Japanese Navy, demanding its return as soon as possible. Soon after, it was reported that the Yongzhen had been released by the Japanese side and left Qingdao at 8:00 yesterday morning and returned directly to Shanghai. It will arrive in port today. As for the Haida and Hava, there was also news of their release yesterday evening, but it has not been confirmed.

Kailin Sailed to Fuyu and was Forced to Return

The British Kailin Marler also operates on the Fuyu route. After the Haida and other ships were detained, the ship asked the British Consul General to inform the British Navy to send a British ship to protect the ship when it sailed from Shanghai on the 28th to ensure safety. After arriving at Yanghekou, the British ship went to Qingdao, but the ship was immediately blocked by four Japanese warships stationed at the port and could not enter Hexing Town to berth and unload cargo. It was not until 10:00 yesterday morning that it was forced to return to Shanghai from Yanghekou on the same ship. It will arrive in port today. According to the current situation, the port has been illegally blockaded by Japanese warships. Whether foreign ships can sail depends on negotiations.

Foreigners are Outraged by Japanese Actions

The British and American foreigners in this city have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side for refusing to open the Yangtze River and preventing foreign ships from sailing, but to no avail. It is obvious that the Japanese side intends to squeeze out the rights and interests of foreigners in China. Therefore, the public is extremely angry. Since the Haida and other ships were detained and Kailin was prevented from unloading cargo, the foreign side believes that the Japanese actions are becoming more and more unreasonable. Therefore, in order to protect their rights and interests, they will once again request their respective governments to take further effective measures.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Shipping Vessels Passenger and Cargo Restriction Measures

Three Companies Will Meet Today to Discuss Unified Water Freight Prices, Passenger Tickets for Each Ship Will Temporarily Follow the Original Price When Direct Shipping

After the resumption of direct shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the ships Moufu, Xin'anna, and Liangzhou set sail for Ningbo the afternoon before yesterday, and the Deping is scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo today. In addition to loading cargo, passengers are also allowed to board, but there are considerable restrictions. Regarding the issue of water freight prices, Taikoo and other three companies will hold a meeting today to discuss it. As for passenger tickets, they will temporarily follow the original price when direct shipping. The following are the details of the situation investigated by the reporter of the Modern News Agency:

Loading and Passenger Restriction Measures

Since the Headquarters of the 10th Army Group promulgated the revised shipping regulations, allowing direct shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, in accordance with the provisions of the new regulations, the approved

Conclusion of Interrogation of Kaibo Ship Crew

All Crew Members Return to Shanghai Today

The Kaibo struck a reef and sank in the Diaoban Ocean off Haimen, and all crew members were rescued and safely arrived in Taizhou. More than 40 of the crew members returned to Shanghai on the Shantai last Saturday (28th) led by the compradore Zhang Yunquan. The ship owner Olson, the first, second, and third mates, and the foreman and steward were still staying in Taizhou, waiting for the interrogation by the Wen-Tai Garrison Command, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the ship owner, saying that the interrogation had been concluded and they were allowed to return to Shanghai on the Hana, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. Vessels sailing on each route, whether from Ningbo to Shanghai or from Shanghai to Ningbo, are no longer prohibited from carrying passengers, but there are still considerable restrictions to prevent abuse. The measures are as follows: All Chinese men aged 16 to 45 are prohibited from leaving the country. Those who are not within this limit must hold legal documents (identity card or certificate from the local county government or above) before they can be released. Civil servants leaving the country on official business and students leaving the country to take entrance exams must hold legal certification documents from the dispatching agency for civil servants and from the county government or school of origin for students, otherwise they will not be allowed to leave the country. Merchants leaving the country to purchase goods or escort goods must submit an application form, attach a bareheaded photo of themselves two and a half inches in size, and obtain a guarantee from a reputable shop with more than 2,000 yuan in the local area, or a certification document from the local county government or above, before they are allowed to leave the country. Steamboat crew members are not allowed to go up and down the docks without holding the ship's documents. Entering passengers must hold appropriate documents, otherwise those who are considered to have suspicious behavior should be detained, refused to land, or released on bail, depending on the circumstances. All domestic native products are prohibited from being loaded and transported unless they have been approved by a higher authority, or stipulated by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, or approved by the Ministry after a commercial request. Enemy goods are absolutely prohibited from entering. Other foreign goods are allowed to be imported unless there are explicit restrictions from the Central Government or the Zhejiang Provincial Government.

Deping to Continue Sailing to Ningbo Today

The Moufu of Jardine Matheson, the Xin'anna of Butterfield & Swire, and the Liangzhou of Taikoo set sail directly for Ningbo one after another the afternoon before yesterday. Except for the Liangzhou, which is a purely cargo ship and does not carry passengers, the other two ships, Moufu and Xin'anna, carried a small number of passengers, but all passengers prepared guarantee forms, photos, and other certification documents in accordance with the regulations and orders before they were allowed to purchase tickets and disembark. The procedures were very strict. It is learned that the Deping of Zhongyi Company is also scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo from Shanghai at 3:00 this afternoon. Passengers will also be handled in accordance with the regulations to ensure caution.

Shipping Companies Meet to Discuss Unified Water Freight

Regarding the water freight of goods on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, since the war, due to the obstruction of direct shipping, each ship detoured through Wentai, which increased expenses, and the price of coal soared. Therefore, the water freight continued to increase. Zhongyi Company once lowered the price and reduced it to 40% of the actual price, but the other ships have not been unified, resulting in chaotic prices. Now, Butterfield & Swire, the shipping department of Reiss & Co., and Zhongyi Shipping Company, in order to unify water freight prices and avoid price competition among their peers, have scheduled a meeting of representatives from the three companies at Taikoo at 11:00 this morning to discuss and determine a fair water freight price list in accordance with the intentions of the Zhejiang Provincial authorities, so that neither the company nor the passengers will suffer losses, and then report it to the Ningbo authorities for record and common compliance.

Ship Tickets Return to Original Price

The ship ticket prices on the Shanghai-Ningbo line were originally 3 yuan for the third class, 5 yuan for the cabin class, and 7 yuan for the official class when the ships were sailing directly, which was already more than double the price before the war. Later, due to the ban on shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, passengers transferred to Taizhou, and the third class cost 8 yuan per person. When each ship detoured through Wen and sailed to Ningbo, the fare was also 8 yuan for the third class, 10 yuan for the cabin class, and 14 yuan for the official class, which was almost five or six times higher than before the war. Passengers traveling between Ningbo and Ningbo complained. Now that direct shipping has resumed, the passenger tickets have also been restored to the previously determined original price, which is still 3 yuan for the third class, 5 yuan for the cabin class, and 7 yuan for the official class. However, the Deping sells 1.5 yuan for the third class, 4 yuan for the cabin class, and 6 yuan for the official class when returning from Ningbo to Shanghai. It is said that the prices are still temporary and may be adjusted again within days.

The General Closing Period is Approaching Financial Markets are Stable

The Money Industry is Scheduled to Hold a Regular Meeting the Day After Tomorrow to Discuss Market Interest Rates

Since the Money Industry Association decided that February 18th was the general closing period for the 27th year of the Republic of China, and the four days of the 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd were the general settlement period, all stores uniformly took holidays to handle the closing. Each industry decided to handle the general settlement based on the money industry. Now, as the general settlement period is approaching, preparations have been made separately. For the accounts in this city, invoices are distributed and the repayment deadline is limited. Staff are sent to collect the accounts in other cities separately, and the responsible managers allocate funds to smoothly pass this general settlement period. The Money Industry Association has issued a notice to convene a regular meeting of member representatives at 2:00 p.m. on February 2nd to discuss preparations before and after the general settlement, such as market interest rates, the time for each store to collect and return tickets on New Year's Eve, and the listing date after the general settlement. According to the reporter of the New Voice Agency's inquiry with each industry yesterday, Shanghai after the war, due to the increase in population and the destruction of factories in the inland, the production has decreased. Therefore, the factories within the concession have developed abnormally, especially the national goods factories. The newly established factories in the concession are like mushrooms after rain. In terms of silk factories, there are about 25 newly established ones. There are more than 100 newly established cotton spinning, knitting, and silk weaving factories. The factories in the inland have also moved to Shanghai to start work. There are also three newly emerging needle factories in Shanghai. Regarding the financial market on the isolated island, it is still stable as always. Therefore, there will be no unfortunate events during the general settlement period, which is very different from the 26th year of the Republic of China.

### Dead and Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported to Hongkou

The Pudong Guerrilla Team is Active and the Japanese Side Has Increased Troops

Due to the great strength of the guerrilla teams in Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui counties, the Japanese army recently felt that it was difficult to cope with the original garrison in Pudong. Therefore, 200 or so troops stationed in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Songjiang were transferred to reinforce the defense the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, about 80 dead and wounded Japanese soldiers were transported from Nanhuangpu to Hongkou on small transport ships, waiting to be transported to Japan.

### Farewell Banquet for the Chinese Directors of the Bureau of Public Works for the British Army Commander

Major General Simmalé Promoted to Governor of the Strait Islands

Major General Simmalé, the commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, has been in Shanghai for many years and will soon be transferred to another location (promoted to Governor of the British Strait Islands). All the Chinese directors of the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession, after the "August 13th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the commander had served as the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces of Britain, the United States, Italy, and other countries stationed in Shanghai, commanding the defense forces, planning security, and sparing no effort. He was especially sympathetic to the rescue of refugees. In order to express gratitude on behalf of our country's residents, a farewell banquet was held at the residence of Mr. Yu Qiaqing on Gao Naiyi Road at 12:00 noon yesterday (30th), and congratulations were offered on the promotion. In addition to inviting the commander and the chief of staff of the army, Major An Shumma, Colonel Xiang Pei, the commander of the International Volunteer Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Xu Tonghao, the deputy commander, Major Ke Ping, the staff, Major Hu Yunqiu, the consultant of the corps, and Captain Chen Shixia, the captain of the Chinese team, were invited to accompany them. In addition to Mr. Yu Qiaqing presiding over the Chinese directors, Mr. Guo Shun Yuan Lvdeng, Jiang Yiping, and Xi Yushu also attended. During the banquet, Mr. Yu delivered a speech on behalf of the directors and presented a set of antiques and a eulogy as a souvenir. Then, the commander stood up to thank them. The guests and hosts toasted each other and the banquet ended in joy at about 2:00 p.m.

### Last Month's Shanghai Municipal Council Monthly Report

Satisfactory Sanitary Conditions, Extremely Burdensome Police Work

Health Report

According to the Health Officer's report for December, the sanitary conditions in this port were still unsatisfactory due to the prevalence of smallpox. A large number of Chinese people migrated from other ports without being vaccinated, making it easy for smallpox to spread. The number of recorded Chinese deaths was 5,900, including 4,842 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were smallpox, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever. Various infectious diseases of the digestive system had mostly disappeared, while infectious diseases of the respiratory system had increased due to the gradual cold weather. The Health Department continued to distribute milk to women and children in refugee camps. All infectious disease hospitals established by the Shanghai Municipal Council were overcrowded due to the prevalence of smallpox, but these hospitals had been expanded, so the problem of bed availability was not as serious as before. The work of the school medical department continued as usual. The department inspected private Chinese schools that had received or applied for subsidies from the Shanghai Municipal Council 208 times. Cases of smallpox were found in several schools, so the Health Department had to perform special supervisory duties and take preventive measures. The veterinary department continued to inspect imported pigs. Of the 52,064 live pigs imported last month, 0.87% died during transportation to this port. In November of last year, the mortality rate was only 0.35%. This increase in the mortality rate was entirely due to the cold weather and slow transportation. The business of vegetable markets in the western and central districts of the Settlement was as prosperous as before, and the vegetable markets in the northeastern districts had gradually returned to normal. The vaccination campaign continued, but the results were worse than in November. Huts in various places were inspected as usual in January, and the sanitary conditions had improved significantly. The number of refugee camps and the number of refugees accommodated had decreased. The large refugee camp on Duncin Road will be opened soon, and it is hoped that all the refugees currently occupying private houses in the central and northern districts can be moved there. Personnel were also sent to inspect coffin depositories at any time. All coffins were found to be structurally sound and tightly sealed, so as not to impede hygiene. Cremation of corpses was performed once a day. Personnel responsible for preventing malaria have begun surveying the western district, with the intention of filling in places where stagnant water accumulates to prevent mosquito breeding.

Police Report

The Shanghai Municipal Police Department handled 1,773 criminal cases in December of last year, an increase of 58 cases compared to November of the same year. A total of 1,672 criminals were arrested by the department. In addition, there were 164 criminals who committed crimes in previous months, and 24 criminals who were arrested on behalf of government offices outside the Settlement. There were 68 people who committed crimes using firearms. Nine firearms, along with a large amount of ammunition, were seized. Among the recorded major criminal cases were seven attempted murder cases, one armed robbery case, and one bombing case. The narcotics division of the Police Department conducted ten searches and arrested 28 opium offenders. The police stations handled 28 opium cases and arrested 81 opium offenders. Many newly established opium dens and gambling houses have appeared on the roads outside the Settlement in the western district, which often leads to disturbances by bandits, endangering public safety. In view of this situation, the Police Department has set up wire mesh frames in several places and searched passers-by to prevent accidents. The number of workers in the Settlement has gradually increased. Last month there were more than 149,000 workers. A portion of the employees of the Commercial Press once went on strike, but soon resumed work. As of the end of last month, there were 68 refugee camps in the Settlement, accommodating a total of 49,844 refugees. In addition, there were 4,770 refugees living in alleys and empty houses. Six Chinese newspapers were warned by the police for publishing inaccurate news or inappropriate text. A total of 34 publication registration certificates were issued. A total of 39,117 public rickshaw pullers have been registered. A total of 924 public rickshaw pullers were punished by the Central and Louza police stations for violating traffic regulations. In addition, the licenses of 50 public rickshaw pullers were withheld for one month for carrying objects on their vehicles that could easily damage or destroy the vehicles. There were 970 accidents that caused injury or property damage. Street vendors, beggars, and vagrants were continuously expelled by the police at any time.

### Muslims Celebrate "Eid" Today

Muslims from all directions pay homage to the Kaaba, and all believers gather for prayers in the mosque.

Today is one of the major annual gatherings of Islam. Muslims who can go to Mecca to pay homage to the Kaaba gather at the Kaaba Mosque today to hold a major prayer. Muslims in various places will also go to the local mosque to hold prayers, and slaughter livestock to distribute to relatives, friends, and the general public. Islam calls it the "Eid" festival, which means the festival of sacrifice. It has three meanings: 1. unity; 2. sacrifice; 3. charity. Muslims in this city will go to five places for worship: the Zhejiang Road Mosque, the Xujiahui Road Mosque, the Xiaoshadu Road Mosque, the Hongshoufang Mosque, and the Gordon Road Mosque. In addition, the Islamic Association of this city has specially printed and distributed Eid special issues widely. At the same time, the income and expenditure report booklet printed by the Islamic Association's Disaster Relief Association will also be distributed in various halls.

### Senior Municipal Council Officials Received Salary Increase Yesterday

The Outside World's Protests Did Not Stop It; The Committee Has Not Yet Made a Recommendation

The English-language "Great Evening News" reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council disregarded public protests and paid salaries today (the 30th). Higher and next-highest-level officials all received large salaries. Lower-level officials who needed salary increases received very little, which aroused public dissatisfaction. The Christmas subsidy, which caused public dissatisfaction, was also distributed. The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of public opposition, organized a committee of business representatives to investigate the matter, but in fact did not change its decision. The public expected that the salary increase plan should at least be postponed until the business representatives submitted a report, but now they are disappointed. According to Committee Chairman Hawkins, who spoke to reporters this morning, the association has not yet reported its findings to the authorities. Municipal Council Secretary-General Philip also said that the authorities must receive a report on the progress of the committee before they can know it. According to today's Japanese-language "Continental New News", the Japanese Residents Association in Hongkou is also troubled by the salary problem. The salaries of some teachers in Japanese schools are too low, so they are looking for other jobs. The salaries of the employees of the Residents Association are all 30% lower than the salary standards of the employees of Japanese commercial firms. The decline in the "efficiency" of school teachers is also due to low salaries. The association is now considering increasing the salaries of employees and teachers.

### Changshu Guerrilla Fights Bravely; Japanese and Puppet Troops Suffer Heavy Losses

Commander Cai Has Submitted the Anti-Japanese War Process to the War Zone Commander to Request Commendation

Modern News Agency reported that, according to people from Changshu, at six o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, 300 to 400 Japanese and puppet troops advanced on Dongtang Town, more than 20 li away from the city, in three routes. One route went east from Wuta, one route went north from Weijingtang outside Qimen in Suzhou, and one route went south from Chenxiang. When the Japanese and puppet troops advanced to about four or five li away from the town, they came into contact with the sentry post of Zhang Jinlin's unit, the ××th Battalion Commander of Cao Changjin's department, Deputy Commander of the People's Self-Defense Force and Commander of the 11th Ladder Regiment of the Changshu, Jia, Tai, Kun, Qing, and Song Six-County Guerrilla. The gunfire was dense, and the Chinese army stationed in the rear responded to the sound to support them. Battalion Commander Zhang disregarded his personal safety and personally led the team to charge forward. The fierceness of the battle was even greater than the two battles of Jiulijiao and Licun before Changshu was lost. It only eased slightly until one o'clock in the afternoon. In this battle, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered 70 to 80 casualties, and a lot of weapons and ammunition were captured. On the Chinese side, only six or seven people were killed or injured. It is reported that the cause of the incident in the town was that the traitor Gui Zijia (i.e. the puppet county magistrate) wanted to buy over Cao's department and reorganize it into the puppet "Security Team", but because Commander Cao refused to accept it, he instigated the Japanese and puppets to invade, trying to threaten him. Now Commander Cai has reported the battle process of Cao's department to Commander Gu of the Third War Zone and will be awarded.

### Portuguese New Consul General Manuel Succeeds

The Continental News reported yesterday (29th) that, according to responsible sources, Portuguese Consul General to Shanghai Alves, who once served as Chairman of the Consular Corps in this port, has been transferred to New York as Consul General, but will wait for his successor to arrive in Shanghai before leaving. The successor is Manuel, the current Portuguese Consul General in Hamburg. Mr. Manuel is a Doctor of Law from the University of Lisbon. He entered the diplomatic world in early 1912 and has served as a consul in the United Kingdom and other countries. He has a good reputation.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Explains the Regulations on Cooperative Banks

In areas where cooperative banks have been established, no cooperative banks of the same level may be established.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to explain that Article 5 of the Cooperative Bank Regulations stipulates that no more than two cooperative banks of the same level may be established in the same area, which means that in areas where cooperative banks have been established, no cooperative banks of the same level may be established again. Please be informed and pass on the information. This order.

### Fifty Scout Groups Hold Memorial for the Four Martyrs and Mourn Citizen Cang Chengquan

### Taking Shanghai as a Haven, Jewish Refugees Are Coming in an Endless Stream; The Number Will Exceed 4,000 and the Relief Association Cannot Cope

The Zi Lin Daily reported that the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde" arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th) afternoon, carrying 420 German and Austrian Jews. Therefore, the number of Jewish refugees in Shanghai has reached about 2,000. The group arrived at the Customs Wharf at 7:00 p.m. After their luggage was inspected, they were sent to various residences in Hongkou reserved for them by the various relief committees. In the future, more Jewish refugees will take this port as their destination, because they really cannot obtain visas to enter other countries. Although some of the Jewish refugees who have arrived in Shanghai have found jobs in this port, and a few have brought money with them, most of them are destitute. Moreover, according to news from Rome, 1,000 Jews, mostly from Germany, had already boarded the Italian mail ship "Conte Biancamano" in Naples, Italy, on Friday and set off for Shanghai, which is expected to arrive on February 22nd. In addition, two ships sailing between Germany and the United States have been rented in Hamburg to transport Jewish refugees from Germany to Shanghai, totaling as many as 2,000 people. Most of these refugees will stay in Shanghai, and a few will transfer to Dalian, because about 300 people have been approved by the Dalian authorities to live there. On Friday of last week, ten immigrants landed in Shanghai, and 100 more came to Shanghai yesterday, mostly from Germany, and have been provided with temporary residences by the relief committee. The Shanghai Committee for the Relief of European Jewish Immigrants has encountered an extremely serious situation due to a lack of sufficient funds. Now that 2,000 more people are about to arrive, it will be even more difficult, because Germany implements strict regulations on individuals carrying money out of the country. Therefore, among the refugees who have come to Shanghai, only 20% can support themselves. The various relief committees need 90,000 yuan per month to maintain the refugees' food and accommodation. The Shanghai Municipal Council has asked the Consular Corps to pay attention to this issue and consider a proper way to at least temporarily curb the continued arrival of refugees, but no definite conclusion has been reached so far.

### U.S., German, and British Trade with China Fell Sharply Last Year

Affected by the Japanese Seizure of Customs, Imports Decreased Significantly Compared to the Previous Year

After the Japanese seized the customs in the occupied areas, they forcibly reduced the tax rate on Japanese goods, deposited tax revenue in Japanese banks, and hindered the import of foreign goods in order to facilitate the dumping of Japanese goods. The trade between the United States, Germany, Britain, and other countries and China has been greatly affected, and the value of imported and exported goods has decreased sharply. However, the import and export of Japanese goods has suddenly increased, making it the crown of all countries. The trade between the United States, Germany, Britain, and Japan with China in the past two years is recorded as follows (units in thousands of yuan):

The Government Plans to Issue 500 Million Yuan of National Construction Bonds

Exclusively for the Development of Treasures in Various Provinces; the Industrial Cooperation Association Sets Up Four Branches

In order to develop the rich resources of the southwest, the National Government, in addition to planning to complete the southwest and northwest railway networks, is also building highways in various provinces to facilitate transportation. Although the provincial capitals of Guizhou, Sichuan, Kang, Qing, Xinjiang, Gansu, Xia, Shaanxi, Yunnan, and Guangxi have now been opened to traffic in sections, bridges, vehicles, and driving equipment are very lacking. The Ministry of Communications has now established a Highway General Administration Office to handle road construction and driving matters, so as to make them safe, fast, accurate, convenient, and economical. In addition, the Highway Bureaus of the nine provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Qian, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Kang have been established to handle the joint transportation of highways in the nine provinces and are responsible for rectifying the accumulated abuses of highways, so as to maximize the benefits of transportation and cooperate with the Highway General Administration Office in division of labor. The former is responsible for management, and the latter is engaged in engineering design and planning, and various supervision matters. For the unfinished Yunnan-Guangxi, Sichuan-Yunnan, Sichuan-Kang, Sichuan-Gansu, Gansu, Sichuan-Qing, Kang-Yunnan, Shaanxi-Ningxia, Sichuan-Hubei, and other main lines, and other necessary branch lines, plans have been made to complete them selectively in the short term as a supplement to railway transportation.

### Membership of Trade Associations is Limited to Nationals of the Republic of China

Managers or Agents of Foreign Shipping Companies May of Course Become Members If There is No Foreign Capital

The Ministry of Economic Affairs explained the nationality doubts of members of trade associations and sent a letter to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, stating that the application of the Ministry of Communications for clarification of the doubts about the nationality of members of the Commercial Trade Association was approved by the discussion and reply of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the relevant notification was issued, and the original application was copied and sent to the Ministry. It was found that the commercial trade association takes companies and firms in the same area as members, and expressly stipulates that representatives of members are limited to those with the nationality of the Republic of China, then the nationality of members is also limited to the nationality of the Republic of China. For example, as explained by the Judicial Yuan on June 14, 1933, No. 933, if the shareholders of a foreign firm are all citizens of the Republic of China, they are in line with the so-called stores in Article 9 of the Chamber of Commerce Law and the so-called firms in Article 7 of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, and should be allowed to join the Chamber of Commerce as members. The so-called companies and firms that manage or act as agents for foreign ships and steamers in the original application may of course become members of the commercial trade association if there is no foreign capital and the managers or agents are all citizens of the Republic of China. As for Article 5 of the Commercial Trade Association Law, it stipulates that there is only one commercial trade association in the same area. If Yongjia County already has such a trade association, it does not seem appropriate to approve the establishment again.

### Introducing Refugee Occupations

The Executive Yuan Approved the Formulation of Measures and Organizations to Apply for Subsidies

The Relief Committee has been planning the transport, reception, allocation, and participation in production enterprises for the relief of refugees in the war zone. However, after investigation, the organs, factories, organizations, and shops in the rear often need employees. There are many refugees who have not yet been employed and have expertise, but they suffer from the fact that there is a lack of liaison and introduction agencies, and the supply and demand cannot meet each other. Previously, Wuhan was a concentrated area of refugees, and the 8th Relief Area tried out job introduction, which had considerable results. It is planned to handle it in a unified manner, and the relief branch associations of each relief area and each province and city will be held separately, and the social organizations with reputation will be entrusted to handle it depending on the circumstances, so as to promote relief. The draft of eight articles of the measures for introducing refugees to occupations and five articles of the measures for social organizations to apply for subsidies for introducing refugees to occupations have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Introduction Method

The introduction of refugees to occupations shall be handled by the agencies and organizations designated or entrusted by the association: 1. The offices of the association's relief areas; 2. The general and branch stations for transporting and allocating refugees; 3. The relief associations of each province, city, and county; 4. Social organizations with a reputation. Social organizations that are entrusted by the association to handle the introduction of refugees to occupations may apply to the association for subsidies in accordance with the separately formulated rules for applying for subsidies. Refugees who request to be introduced to occupations shall apply for registration with the agencies and organizations that handle the introduction of refugees to occupations. Organs, organizations, schools, factories, shops, or individuals that need employees may request the introduction of employees to the agencies and organizations that handle the introduction of refugees to occupations, but after receiving the letters introducing employees, whether they are hired or not, they shall reply within three days, and those who have been hired shall state their service location, position, and treatment, and if there are any changes, they shall report them for record at any time.

Subsidy Funds

The main points of the rules for social organizations to apply for subsidies for introducing refugees to occupations are as follows: The subsidy shall not exceed 50% of the budget for the group's expenses for introducing refugees to occupations. If the association considers that the group that accepts the association's subsidies is not doing a good job, it may stop the subsidy.

### The Transportation Industry in This Port is Gradually Declining

More Than 30 Companies Will Be Closed

After the restoration of inland transportation, the transportation industry in Shanghai flourished like bamboo shoots after a rain, especially along the Suzhou River, which was almost lined up one after another. Because of the fierce competition in the same industry, the amount of money released was very small, and the expenses were huge, so they could not be maintained. The shipping companies such as Lixingyuan Feng, Anchang, etc. declared liquidation. Li Weixuan, the manager of the Taihe Water and Land Transportation Company in Pentang Lane Bridge East, also declared liquidation by lawyer Chen Xingmin due to excessive losses and inability to operate. According to people in the industry, there will be more than 30 companies that will be closed after the end of the Lunar New Year.

### Jiading Bank Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Resumption

Scheduled to Fulfill the Reconciliation Plan After Jiading Bank closed, it applied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for reconciliation in accordance with the Bankruptcy Law. The proposed reconciliation plan has been approved by the creditors' meeting on November 26, 1938, and the reconciliation contract was signed at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on December 5, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent it to the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special Zone Local Court for record. It is now scheduled to implement the reconciliation plan from February 1, 1939, that is, to pay 15% of the cash to each ordinary creditor, 33% of the stock certificate, and 35% of the debt certificate as full payment, and scheduled to convene a shareholders' meeting at 3:00 p.m. on March 1 at the Bank Association on the fifth floor of 59 Hong Kong Road to discuss amending the articles of association, determine the date of resumption, and re-elect directors and supervisors.

### The Sixth Installment of Unified Principal and Interest Will Be Paid Starting Today; Changed to Be Paid in Full in Chongqing

In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance approved the payment of the sixth installment of principal and interest of the five types of unified government bonds A, B, C, D, and E, which will be due at the end of this month, by the Central Bank and its entrusted China and Transportation Banks, but changed to be paid in full in Chongqing, and the rest of the places, such as Shanghai, will be repaid in six installments. The three banks in Shanghai, China, China, and Transportation, have been ordered to handle the installment payment procedures starting today. The installment payment forms have been printed. The payment is in legal tender, not remittance.

### Resumption of Postal Service in Anhui Province Must Be Postponed Again

Currently, Only Wuhu and Bengbu Have Postal Service. The situation of resuming postal service in Anhui Province has now suffered a setback. According to personnel from the Postal Administration Office, the Postal Administration Bureau of Anhui Province withdrew to Shanghai after the fall of Anqing. It has been a long time since then. Although it has been planned to resume it again and again, it has not been realized. Recently, it was planned to leave for Anhui at the beginning of next month to make arrangements for the resumption of postal service. Now, there is another obstacle, so it will probably have to be postponed until mid-March before it can be realized. It has been found that the current postal service areas in Anhui Province are only Wuhu and Bengbu (both first-class post offices), which are temporarily transferred to the Jiangsu Administration Bureau for concurrent management, and the rest have not been posted. The postal pieces in Hankou are also limited to the urban area of Hankou, and the rest are suspended. At the same time, the economic income of the Shanghai Post Office is declining day by day. Among the various businesses, except for the telegraphic transfer, the rest are very deserted.

### 一年來之上海戰時物價（上）

— 尹蘭

Shanghai's wartime prices in the past year (Part 1)

— Yin Lan

It has been more than a year since our army withdrew from Shanghai last November (26th year of the Republic). The price level is about one-third higher than before the war. During the second year of the European War, the price increases in the warring countries compared to before the war were similar, with France and Germany increasing by about 40 percent and Britain by about 27 percent. In terms of the market prices of major commodities, the fluctuations vary, and the reasons are also complex. Taking the period before the war, i.e., from June of last year to February of this year (27th year of the Republic), as the first phase, and from February of this year to the recent November as the second phase, the comparison is made in phases as shown in the table below: Percentage increase or decrease in Shanghai market prices (national currency yuan)

### 花會頭目毛阿祥　公然設廠誘賭

The head of the lottery syndicate, Mao Axiang, openly sets up a factory to lure gambling

Yiji branch factory raided by the police, four criminals arrested and sentenced separately

Guan Huchen, a detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, learned that a lottery branch factory, numbered Yongji, had been set up in an unnumbered bungalow bordering the Chinese area on Peace Road in western Shanghai. It was a branch of the Yiji lottery syndicate established by Mao Axiang and others in Caojiadu. Since the Public Concession police authorities had selectively blocked the traffic routes to opium dens in the western district, it had become inconvenient for those with these two habits in the Concession. Therefore, Mao Axiang set up a branch factory to attract more customers. Although the factory was located in a bungalow, the entrance was equipped with a drum-shaped lamp shade with the words "Yongji Lottery Agency Yiji Branch Factory" written in vermilion, which was very eye-catching. However, lottery operations have always been conducted in secret. To openly lure gambling like this was unprecedented. Guan Detective then reported to the police chief the day before yesterday and led Chinese Detective Tang Jian, Wu Chengmo, Western Detective and other officers to raid the factory. They arrested Zhang Zhilong, who was in charge of the branch factory's affairs, Ding Guoliang, who collected gambling money, and Shao Xiaodi and Zhang Lizhi, who kept accounts. They confiscated three glass signs, one with four lines of lottery riddles, one with lottery nicknames, one with winning lottery numbers, and more than 160 lottery slips, account books, and other gambling paraphernalia. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the details of the case and stated that the main factory of the lottery syndicate was still run by Mao Axiang and Cao Hongsheng and was located on Rue Robert. Since the factory raided was a branch of their syndicate, the case was more serious than previous lottery cases, and the perpetrators should be severely punished. Judge Dai then questioned the four criminals one by one and, after clarifying the facts, sentenced Zhang Zhilong to one and a half years of imprisonment for repeated offenses, and Ding Guoliang, Shao Xiaodi, and Zhang Lizhi to eight months of imprisonment each. All confiscated items were also forfeited.

### 夾底火油箱三隻　滿裝川土

Three fuel tanks with false bottoms, filled with Sichuan opium

Motor vehicle transporting opium seized and intercepted

Xiong Youqing, a 31-year-old man from Hubei, was driving a car past the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue de l'Avenir at around 4:00 PM on the 28th of this month when he was stopped and searched by detectives. Xiong was carrying three fuel tanks. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the tanks had false bottoms, with the upper part of the three tanks filled with soybean oil and the lower part filled with opium. He was immediately taken back to the police station. The total weight of the opium was 39 pounds, all of which was Sichuan opium. When asked where the opium came from, he confessed that it was being delivered to the third floor of the Southeast Hotel on Rue de l'Avenir. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Local Court and requested to be detained and investigated before being interrogated again. After Judge Liao Yuan questioned the defendant, he approved a postponement for further investigation and then interrogation. The defendant was taken into custody.

### 馬育航被殺後　今日大殮

Ma Yuhang's funeral held today after being murdered

The body has been claimed by his son, and the Japanese seem very concerned about this case

The details of Ma Yuhang being shot in the New Asia Hotel on the sixth floor the night before last and dying in the hospital were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Ma's body was sent from the hospital to the Jiaozhou Road morgue at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The police reported the case to the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court, which appointed a prosecutor to inspect the scene. It was confirmed that Ma had been shot to death, and the death certificate was completed and handed over to the family for claiming the body. Ma's son, Siqi, immediately surrendered himself and claimed the body. After signing a guarantee, he hired the World Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road to transport the body to be washed and dressed at around 12:00 PM. The funeral was scheduled for 2:00 PM today at the funeral home, and the coffin will be temporarily stored there before being transported back to his hometown for burial at a later date.

As for the fugitive murderer, the search is still ongoing.

### 公共租界捕房　弋獲土販

Public Concession police capture opium dealers

One case has been sentenced, one case is awaiting investigation

On the day of January 28th, the Public Concession police authorities dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in the Concession to check pedestrians in sections. The Central Police Station also stationed Chinese Detectives Tian Changyuan and No. 840 on the Henan Road Bridge, specializing in searching suspicious pedestrians. At 7:00 AM that morning, a taxi numbered 17723 sped from south to north. The detectives ordered the car to stop, but before the car could stop, a man in the car jumped out and fled. Although the detectives gave chase, they were unable to catch him. They arrested Su Aijian, a Guangdong woman left in the car, and after inspecting the car, found 63 taels of opium in a shoe box. They were taken back to the police station together. Under investigation, Su completely denied the accusation. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted her in accordance with Article 5 of the Anti-Opium Law. When questioned, Su still firmly denied that there was opium hidden in the car. After investigation by Judge Xiao, Su was found not guilty. Bail of 500 yuan was required during the appeal period, and the opium was confiscated.

Feng Xiushan and Liu Shaotian, Chinese Detectives of the Louza Police Station, inspected pedestrians at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Shanxi Road at 7:00 PM on the 29th of the month. They saw Wang Youzhang from Jiangyin coming in a rickshaw and went forward to search him. Chen Dalang, the owner of the Tiancheng Shoe Store, also from Jiangyin, suddenly stepped forward to prevent the search, and the detectives arrested him as well. Five and a half taels of heroin were found in a rattan basket on Wang's rickshaw. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted them in accordance with the law. After investigation by Judge Xiao, because further investigation was needed, he ordered a postponement for further questioning in one week.

### 混用偽鈔　主夥被拘訊究

Principal accomplice detained and questioned for using counterfeit money

Jiang Yonglin, an apprentice at the Xieshun Nanhua Store at No. 175 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, received a five-yuan counterfeit note from the Farmers Bank of China at the store counter the day before yesterday morning. Zhou Jiamu, the bookkeeper, discovered it. Because Jiang was unable to compensate for the loss, he ordered Jiang to take the counterfeit note to the Datong Nanhua Store on Rue du Marché to buy ten cans of milk that evening. He was discovered, and the police arrested Jiang and the counterfeit note. Because the store manager, Zong Jingsheng, was suspected of collusion, Zong was arrested. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Second Special District Court and requested to be detained for investigation. Judge Liao Yuan presided over the interrogation in the Criminal Court. The shop assistant of the Datong Nanhua Store testified to the defendant's use of counterfeit money. Jiang and Zong admitted that they had received the counterfeit note in the morning and went to the Datong Store to buy goods. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning on February 3, and the defendants were returned to custody.

### 燃燒煤球中毒

Carbon monoxide poisoning from burning coal briquettes

Wu Zhangshi, a 22-year-old woman from Ningbo, who lived at No. 26 Yinhe Lane, Minquan Road in the French Concession, suffered carbon monoxide poisoning at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday while burning a coal briquette stove for warmth in her bedroom. Because the doors and windows were tightly closed, she was poisoned by the coal. Her roommates discovered her and rushed her to the hospital for treatment.

The lawsuit over the Lao Da Fang trademark still requires investigation and is postponed for further questioning

Shen Hongjian, the manager of the Lao Da Fang teahouse and confectionery store at No. 378 Zhejiang Road, has been in business for many years and has flourished. To prevent counterfeiting, he registered the words "Lao Da Fang" with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and the Bureau of Social Affairs. However, recently, the Lao Da Fang brand has been seen everywhere in the market. Shen hired Lawyer Mao Xianshen to publish warnings in the newspaper twice. Unexpectedly, Chen Jiruo, the manager of the Lao Da Fang Xiji at No. 542 Nanjing Road, the Lao Da Fang Xinhao at No. 290 Nanjing Road, and the Lao Da Fang Xiji at No. 34 Haig Road, saw the reports and believed that Shen Hongjian was deliberately defaming them. They hired Lawyers Wang Weizhen and Yin Shijie to file a criminal lawsuit against Shen in the First Special Court. After the court hearing, because Shen Hongjian had already filed a lawsuit in the civil court, the criminal case was suspended. Shen still hired Lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a civil lawsuit in the civil court against Lao Da Fang Xiji, Xinhao, Xiji (manager Chen Jiruo), Jianji at No. 34 Haig Road (manager Wang Jianzhong), Tianji at No. 9716 Jing'an Temple Road (manager Xia Xinzhi), etc., requesting that the defendants be ordered not to use Lao Da Fang as their business name in accordance with the Commercial Registration Law and its implementing regulations. After one hearing, Wang Weizhen, the lawyer for the defendant Chen Jiruo, argued that Lao Da Fang Xiji was established before the plaintiff and was not subject to commercial registration restrictions, and that the Haig Road branch was a branch of Xiji and was not subject to the relevant laws. The lawyer for the defendant in Jianquan stated that ordinary and similar store names that had been in use for a long time could not be registered unless they were separately marked. He recalled that the Ministry of Justice also had this explanation. The court ordered a postponement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tao continued the hearing. The plaintiff's lawyer Mao Xianshen made a statement. The defendant's lawyer Wang Weizhen presented the water and electricity deposit receipt of Lao Da Fang Xiji to prove that the store was indeed a branch of Xiji. However, after reviewing the receipt, Lawyer Mao stated that the receipt could only prove that Lao Da Fang Xiji had paid the deposit with shares from the power company, but it could not prove that the Haig Road branch was a branch of Xiji. Moreover, the plaintiff's business registration had been publicly announced and certified by the Trademark Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs, and others should not be allowed to use it. He requested that the court make a judgment in accordance with the law. Judge Tao stated that the case still required investigation and ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### 闢室振華旅館　聚賭抽頭

### 偽「司法處」偽員　得賄放縱罪犯　偽「處長」竟不加深究

Fake officials of the fake "Judicial Office" accept bribes to release criminals, and the fake "Director" does not investigate further

A scandal recently occurred in the fake "Municipal Government Judicial Office" in which fake officials accepted bribes to release criminals, involving internal fake "officials." After the case was discovered, the fake "Director" Wu Wenzhong protected his henchmen and only detained eight minor fake officials, without pursuing the matter further, showing the corruption of the fake organization. The incident started when Song Wenkui, a rogue from Yangzhou, only in his twenties, extorted money from boatmen and vegetable vendors upstream of the Suzhou River a few days ago. He was arrested by the fake "Police Station" and sent to the fake "Office" on Dongchang Road in Pudong for interrogation. After the "interrogation," he was sentenced to one year and three months of "imprisonment." After being sent to the fake "prison," Song and two other minor "offenders" (one named Chen Dezhou and one named Han) discussed a plan. They agreed that Han would take the opportunity of his early release to lobby the fake "warden" and fake "bailiff" on behalf of Song. Chen Dezhou, who was only sentenced to five days of imprisonment, was about to be released. At that time, Song would replace Chen's name and be released, and Chen would serve Song's sentence. Song would be responsible for Chen's household expenses every month during Chen's imprisonment. After the terms were agreed upon, 300 yuan was paid in bribes in advance, with the understanding that another 200 yuan would be bribed after "prison." When Chen's five-day sentence expired, Song replaced Chen's name and was released. The fake "judge" did not even examine the real and fake "offenders" and was successfully fooled. The so-called golden cicada escape plan was sold. Several days later, Han, acting on Song's orders, took Song's note to the fake "Office" in Pudong to continue negotiations and paid another 200 yuan in bribes. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the fake "judge," who detained Han. Han confessed that the bribe recipients were the fake "warden," the fake "detention center director," the fake "bailiff" Zhang Si, and more than ten fake "bailiffs." Han also revealed Song's address, and Song was arrested. After clarifying the truth, in addition to continuing to detain Song and Han, the fake "Director" Wu Wenzhong abused his personal feelings and only recorded a major demerit for the fake "prison official" and the fake "detention center director" without removing them from their posts for investigation. However, the eight fake "bailiffs" were dismissed and detained because they had no backing to speak for them.

### 浪漫女子程瑛　控夫傷害判决

Romantic woman Cheng Ying sues her husband for assault, verdict

Zhao Liyuan fined twenty yuan

Cheng Ying, a graduate of a midwifery school from Changshu, posted an advertisement in a local newspaper for friends after divorcing Dr. Wei Guangcai in September of the year before last. The advertisement stated that the ability to bear financial burdens was a qualification. Zhao Liyuan, the owner of the Liyuan Well Drilling Company at No. 596 Hai Fang Road, from Jiangyin, saw the advertisement and responded. They hit it off immediately and began living together. But in less than two years, a rift developed. Cheng hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Zhao Liyuan in the First Special Court for seduction, assault, and obstructing freedom. The Special Court held two hearings, and the defendant also presented evidence and many tabloid reports to prove that Cheng Ying was a romantic woman who had married multiple times. The defendant claimed that he had been deceived this time. After the court debate concluded, the case was adjourned for sentencing. The details were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen of the Criminal Court announced the verdict, which stated: "Zhao Liyuan is fined twenty yuan for assaulting a person's body. If he is unable to pay, he shall be sentenced to one day of labor for every two yuan. He is not guilty of the remaining charges."

### A Passenger on the Hesheng Wheel - Concealing a Huge Amount of Morphine - Seized by Detectives After Landing

Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, the Hesheng steamboat sailed from another port to Shanghai, docking at Wharf No. 3 of the Roosevelt Dock on the Bund in the French Concession (formerly the Jinliyuan China Merchants Bureau Dock). Afterwards, a passenger, a man surnamed Jia from Shandong, walked ashore alone. He happened to encounter Chinese and foreign detectives dispatched by the French Concession police to inspect pedestrians. Jia, seeing the detectives from afar, panicked and turned to flee. The detectives caught up and searched him, finding 150 packets of morphine, each weighing about one tael, with a total value of about 30,000 yuan, in the interlayer of the cotton-padded jacket Jia was wearing. When asked where he had brought the drugs from and where he was taking them, Jia was evasive. He was taken back to the police station along with the evidence to await investigation and prosecution.

### French Concession Water and Electricity Company - Public Banquet for Fu Liangjun

Mr. Fu Liangjun, manager of the Xinguang Underwear Factory, is young and promising. In addition to managing the affairs of the entire factory, he also works in the Vehicle Department of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company in this port. Recently, because the Xinguang standard shirts produced by the factory have been selling well and the business is becoming increasingly busy, it is difficult for him to handle both. He specifically resigned from the French Concession Water and Electricity Company. Mr. Fu is proficient in mathematics and efficient in handling affairs. The company relies on him heavily, and the colleagues have a particularly harmonious relationship. Therefore, they have repeatedly tried to retain him earnestly.

### Letter

To the Editor: According to Mr. Zhong Xinfu, the person concerned, the news item in the Shen Bao news column on the 23rd of this month, "Zhong Xinfu Denies Nephew", was inaccurate. After the death of his father, he was heavily in debt. Thanks to the assistance of his father's old friends, he was able to make a dangerous situation into a safe one. This shows how difficult the family's financial situation was at the time. How could the Zhong family have any assets? As for his younger brother Liangfu, when he was 21 years old, his mother, in view of the poor family situation, arranged for her second son to find a way out and allowed him to be adopted into the Shen family as a son-in-law. The Shen family immediately adopted him as their heir. The year after Liangfu was adopted, he had a son named Pinfang, who became the Shen family's grandson. Therefore, his enrollment, employment, and marriage were all as Shen Pinfang. To avoid outsiders misunderstanding the truth, he specifically requested that we send a letter on his behalf to make a correction. We are responding to the situation and sending a letter on his behalf as above. Please publish it in the corrections column. Thank you. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhang Shanle, January 30, 28th year of the Republic.

### "Setting a Bamboo Shoot Head"

— Geng

"Setting a bamboo shoot head" is a term from a certain society, and its meaning is "framing".

Eastern carpenters still use ancient techniques to this day. For example, master carpenters building houses and small carpenters making utensils are reluctant to use iron screws. Instead, they prefer to spend more time sawing and chiseling the wood into concave and convex shapes in order to construct the buildings. The convex shape is called the "bamboo shoot head". Therefore, the work of setting the bamboo shoot heads is extremely important for building houses and making utensils. In other words, a house or utensil cannot be successfully built without setting the bamboo shoot heads.

Old friends in a certain society, in order to achieve their extortionist goals or seize the possessions of others, in addition to resorting to intimidation, must also use their brains, change their minds, and come up with eighteen twisted arguments, because simple intimidation will incur the condemnation of the general public. Thus, they make something out of nothing, using false accusations; some "mourning parties" even go so far as to "open the heavenly gate" and destroy their own faces in order to achieve their schemes. This style, this method, is called "setting a bamboo shoot head" in a certain society.

We once said that Shanghai people are very clever, not only are they highly receptive, but they are also very quick to spread information. Shanghai people not only understand this term, but also use it. However, because they lack innate talent, although they understand the meaning of "setting a bamboo shoot head" and can use the phrase "setting a bamboo shoot head," they are still clumsy in implementing it, making it easy for others to see the flaws. They are not as mature and skilled as our eastern neighbor, the "friendly nation."

According to a report from Hong Kong on the 24th in this newspaper, a person from Tianjin said that the assassinations of Liu Datong, Wang Zhulin, Jin Bidong, Kawashima Yoshiko, etc., that recently occurred in the French Concession of Tianjin were all committed by the Japanese themselves. The Japanese intended to use this as a way to coerce the Concession authorities, blaming them for harboring anti-Japanese elements, and demanding the inspection or blockade of the British and French Concessions. This is the latest example of the Japanese implementing "setting a bamboo shoot head."

As for the eastern "friendly nation's" diplomacy towards China, it has consistently adopted a "setting a bamboo shoot head" policy. If you don't believe it, please look through the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, which is filled with stories of "setting bamboo shoot heads" and being "set with bamboo shoot heads." It can also be said that Japan's diplomatic history with China is nothing more than a success story of "setting bamboo shoot heads."

Yes, the eastern "friendly nation" has succeeded in "setting bamboo shoot heads," but they have forgotten that the failure of "setting bamboo shoot heads" is in encountering the other party's "not picking up the pot" and "not buying the story." China's rise to resist Japan is a concrete manifestation of "not picking up the pot" and "not buying the story." When the fascist ogres try to set a question to "set a bamboo shoot head," the democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States should use the method of resisting Japan to deal with this slanderous and vile behavior, and smash the fascist ogres' conspiracy of "setting a bamboo shoot head."

### School Fees More Urgent Than Debt

— Yanran

Because I cannot implement the method of Japanese congressmen and cut off my only "reproductive glands," I have given birth to two "debt-collecting ghosts." Now that I have children, I cannot help but send them to school when they reach school age. Therefore, the school fee for each semester is truly enough to make me, the father who maintains life by using his brains, feel great difficulty and financial strain.

The calendar on the desk is turned over page by page. Oh no! The start of school on February 1st is coming soon again! These days, a nine-year-old child took the "four-part form" from school and gave it to me, telling me to send the school fees to the bank immediately. I took it and looked at it, and it was terrible. The fees to be paid by a primary school student who is just in the second grade are: tuition 16 yuan, textbooks 2 yuan, miscellaneous fees 1 yuan and 5 jiao, construction fees 1 yuan and 5 jiao, totaling 21 yuan in silver dollars. I couldn't help but gasp, and then looked down at the "four-part form." In the notes column, it was clearly printed: "If school fees are not paid before the start of school, the admission certificate will be withheld: after the start of school, a late payment of one day will be fined one yuan. If the fees are still not paid after one week, the student will be expelled." Alas! The school authorities have a stern face and are unwilling to be accommodating at all. Not a penny can be missing. It really leaves parents with no way out. I never thought that in this year, in addition to the "difficulty of making a living," there is even more "difficulty of children going to school." As people used to say, "Human sentiment is as big as debt," now it has become "school fees are more urgent than debt." How can one not be filled with emotion?

However, having said that, since children are born, they naturally have to study; if they want to go to school, then the school fees naturally have to be paid. However, I sincerely request the principals of the schools to fulfill their responsibilities and inspire their conscience after receiving the students' school fees, and not to think that once the money is in their pockets, they can be "satisfied"; they must give the payers a fair price. Otherwise, it would be too unfair to the parents who work hard and scrape together to pay for their children's school fees.

### After Viewing the "American Art School Painting Exhibition":

— Yi Pin

Several art exhibitions have already been held at the Da Sun Company and the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, with a continuous stream of visitors. However, antiques account for nine out of ten of the paintings and calligraphy on display. As for new paintings - "oil paintings", "watercolors", "pencil drawings" - people of older age exclaim with a sigh: "Is this what they call painting?!"

Now, the American Art School appears in a brand new posture on the fourth floor of the Da Sun Company. If you have the time to visit, you will definitely find it very satisfying.

As I excitedly signed my name at the entrance and walked in, I was presented with six large oil paintings, "Refugee Exodus". As I looked at them one by one, scenes of cruel refugee life seemed to float into my mind.

Isn't this one preparing to pack up and flee? They are about to leave their beloved hometown and the farmland where they eke out a living.

And in another one, look, a refugee woman is sitting by the roadside, covering her face with her hands and sobbing. Isn't the corpse lying on the ground in front of her her son?

People living in Shanghai only know about the refugees in the shelters, but the situation they encountered before can be completely told to you here.

"Light Will Come" is extremely well painted. In a corner of an open space, a man and a woman, with the man pointing ahead, as if saying, "The light is coming!" However, the color of the place he is pointing to is somewhat dim, which is too inappropriate (this is my personal opinion). The artist cannot be known.

There is a watercolor painting called "Refugees". The most unbearable thing is the pair of small feet of the old woman, which makes people angry. Foreigners used to insult us with small feet, but now it is our own work. It would be best to improve it as much as possible.

This "American Art School" painting exhibition is quite a success.

### The Problem of Wu Peifu's Late-Life Integrity

— Jin Taipu

The fascist demon of the Far East truly knows how to play tricks. Not long ago, he instigated the peace movement through Wang Jingwei, attempting to undermine our established national policy of resistance. However, with the surge of national sentiment, Wang's telegram became a damp squib, and Wang Jingwei became a traitor stripped bare. The first trick failed. Konoe's cabinet collapsed, followed by a minor ploy, hoping that Prime Minister Chamberlain, after consulting with Germany and Italy, would also consult with Japan, the "third brother" of the East. But the two elder brothers in the West were far more prestigious, and Prime Minister Chamberlain ultimately did not grant this favor. It failed again. Then came the third trick, inviting Wu Peifu to serve as the chairman of the Pacification Committee of Kaifeng, hoping to connect the puppet regimes of the North and South.

Wu Peifu is a famous hardliner. Although he was an old warlord in the past, he often compared himself to Guan Yu and Yue Fei, especially after his military defeat, boasting that he would not seek shelter with foreigners. Recently, Lieutenant General Doihara, a butcher famous for massacring Chinese people, has repeatedly enticed him. Wu Peifu has consistently and sternly refused, even swearing by his coffin. Outsiders believe that Doihara's skills have been exhausted!

But Wu Peifu is ultimately like a priceless antique. The "Jiangxi people" are unwilling to let him go. The harder he resists, the more fiercely they entice him. Now, they are attempting to create a fait accompli by using the title of Chairman of the Pacification Committee of Kaifeng to establish a predetermined reality. They are publicizing it in advance, hoping that in the eyes of the invaders, they can turn falsehood into truth!

However, Wu Peifu's life achievements are not particularly commendable. Only his backbone is indeed more self-respecting than that of Wang Jingwei and his ilk! Moreover, Wu Peifu is also stripped bare. Learning from Wang Jingwei's example, he would be sacrificing his clean reputation in his later years! Allowing the enemies of the nation to violate his Guan Yu and Yue Fei beliefs, and the puppet official career he would gain in return would not be promising. Wu Peifu must ask himself if he is not a fool, not suffering from temporary mental derangement, he would never be so muddled.

### Song of the Colt Shadow

— Li Zhihua

Paramount Pictures Production, Grand Theater Premiere

"Song of the Colt Shadow" (Sing You Sinners) is another film with singing and horse racing as its theme. However, it seems slightly different from other films with the same theme. The difference lies in the author's emphasis on the depiction of human emotions. Therefore, it is much more appealing compared to those films that focus solely on horse racing and singing. Admittedly, the insertion of several singing scenes still feels abrupt, but it is much more reasonable.

Therefore, rather than watching those inexplicable musical films, I would rather watch something like "Song of the Colt Shadow," a musical film without grand spectacles.

The story of "Song of the Colt Shadow" is not particularly convoluted or moving. What I like about it is the human touch. The joy of the Davis family when they hear that their second son, Joey, has found work at a gas station, contrasted with Joey's unemployment and return home, is a good contrast. "Where the bourgeoisie has got the upper hand, it has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his 'natural superiors,' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment.' The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation." Although "Song of the Colt Shadow" does not intentionally write about this iron law, it ruthlessly proves its correctness. In the reality where family relations become "cash payment," the pitiful Davises and their family play a tragicomic role in it. "Song of the Colt Shadow," on the surface, is a comedy with singing and dancing, but if we carefully savor and analyze it, it is a tragicomedy that small citizens in bourgeois society often play. It is precisely because of this point that we find "Song of the Colt Shadow" more commendable than ordinary musical films.

The director's handling of this film has its merits, especially in the relationships between the Davis family members, and in their joys and angers, he is able to grasp the "capriciousness of the small citizen class's tragicomedy"—which is determined by society for them.

However, although the director has this advantage, he cannot solidify it. He only scratches the surface and does not satisfy the audience.

I like most of the actors in this film. Florine McKinney, Donald O'Connor, Elisabeth Patterson, Ellen Drew are all good. Ellen Drew is still a newcomer, and although her role is not important, she shows promise in the scene where she returns from the small bar with Joey. She is a bit sweet, and her style is somewhat similar to Irene Dunne, but she is more innocent than Irene Dunne.

However, Bing Crosby is not particularly good. I find his silly appearance a bit annoying. The songs are also very bland.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Chapter 3: Viewing the Portrait and Remembering the Old Righteous Man, the Little Teacher Opens the Letter for the Illiterate

Jin Danyun said: "What is even more is that things originally possessed by the Chinese are said to be backward, but when they are brought in from foreign countries, they are thought to be fashionable and modern, which is truly ridiculous. I remember my old lady once said that when she was fourteen or fifteen years old, young girls were popular for dyeing their fingernails red. They used balsam flowers mashed up, adding some non-fading materials, and dyed them on their fingernails, thinking it was beautiful. Later, when girls all went to school, this fad was no longer popular, and anyone who dyed their fingernails red would be laughed at as being backward. Who knew that later, something suddenly became popular from Europe and the United States in China, a nail polish called 'Cutex.' For a time, young wives and young ladies seemed to go crazy, everyone dyeing their ten fingers bright red, as if they had grabbed a handful of blood. What does this mean? In short, Chinese women worship Western material things and only know how to blindly follow. Later, after repeated warnings from women's improvement associations, they said that women who painted their fingers with Cutex were indicating that they were lazy women. Because Heaven has endowed people with hands, originally to teach you to work, not to teach you to make decorations. If you paint them so red, it is obvious that you are sitting around all day, doing nothing. In this way, things gradually changed, and with women in our country each having their own careers, that kind of idle wind naturally gradually disappeared. Now, we can take the strengths of advanced European and American countries and discard their weaknesses, knowing what to choose for ourselves. We are neither as deeply resentful of foreigners as we were at first, nor as everything-is-good about foreigners as we were later. This is correct." Lin Jiancheng said, "Alright! We've finished eating and expressed our opinions. Let's go. Are we going to the park now? Or somewhere else?" Because Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyun were frequent visitors, they now had to ask the two He family ladies where they would like to go. They wanted to take a walk in the park, so Lin and Jin accompanied them to the park. Originally, this park was also called Lingcun Park. Although it was very spacious, with the cemetery of the martyrs in the center, many places were not fully equipped. This is because the person in charge adopted an advanced approach. Built at the same time as this park was a museum. That museum was not an ordinary museum, but a museum commemorating the martyrs. Here, everything related to the martyrs, which is worth commemorating, is preserved inside. In addition, there are many spoils of war on display, such as diaries, booklets, Buddhist amulets, "thousand-stitch belts," and photos of wives and daughters found on enemy soldiers. (27)

Free Talk

### Talking About "Good Reportage Literature"

— Qin Lao

A few days ago, in "Free Talk," Mr. Fei Bai had an article discussing reportage literature, saying that because he had read Sinclair's "No Pasaran," he "couldn't help but feel a little ashamed," because "in the past eighteen months," we had "hardly seen any good reportage literature." This is indeed the actual situation, not at all "negating" it. However, this aroused a bit of my opinion.

Several years ago, some critics once advocated that writers could fire a gun in one hand and write a novel in the other. But in the end, such a genius did not appear, proving that it was just critics daydreaming. Naturally, there were writers in legends who could compose poetry on horseback, but composing poetry is possible, writing novels is not, and the poems composed would not be "great" poems either. The reason is very simple: novels most need what Mr. Fei Bai calls "artistic description," and for writers to truly do the work of "description," they need some factual conditions.

Barbusse's "Under Fire" was not written during the Great War; Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" was not written during the Great War. Take the current Spanish War as an example. Writers who have always stayed in Spain have not written a "masterpiece of reportage literature" like "No Pasaran." The famous Dutch writer Jef Last went to Spain to participate in the war, but only wrote a few letters—naturally, that can be said to be "good reportage literature," but it is also not a "masterpiece of reportage literature" like "No Pasaran."

Even if it is not "great" reportage literature, it still has to go through the two processes of general writing: first, there must be "reportage" material. Of course, material is everywhere now, but then there must be some time to sit down and write "literature," in Mr. Fei Bai's words, some time to not "write with a flowing pen." This is not the "treating literature as a mysterious thing" that critics daydreaming several years ago attacked, but a real fact. If literature could be written without a little time to sit down, then it would truly be a "mysterious thing." There are naturally some writers living in Shanghai and Hong Kong now, and they may have time to write in peace, but that is after all a minority, and they may not all be people who have always specialized in "literary" writing. As I see it, literary writers who have honestly participated in the war "for eighteen months" certainly have inexhaustible materials, but the time to sit down must be very short.

I am not saying that current reportage literature should be "like a running account, lacking artistic description, lacking moving power" (please let critics who love to put hats on people not be so quick to put the "pessimism" hat on me, okay?). I am just saying that we should not be too harsh on writers who are running on the battlefront. It is of course best to have a "masterpiece of reportage literature" like "No Pasaran," but if there is none, as long as there are true letters, true chronicles, as long as literary techniques are still used, and as long as it is not a bad work, then it can be tentatively considered passable reportage literature. It is of course best if those works can be "vivid" and "wonderful," but there is also a factual problem here: those who have been able to honestly participate in the war "for eighteen months" are probably mostly young writers. In addition to the difficulty of getting a little time to sit down in life, their writing skills are generally inevitably a little worse. However, old writers are often unwilling to roll around like them, or because they want to prepare for future "masterpieces," they do not care about writing those letters and chronicles. This is something that cannot be helped. Therefore, we can only temporarily satisfy ourselves with those works that are not "vivid" and not "wonderful." But this is only temporary: those writers will soon use their moving lives to turn their "stories" "under the pen" into "vivid" and "wonderful."

Therefore, I believe that if one "cannot help but feel a little ashamed" because one has "hardly seen any good reportage literature," then one should not be "ashamed" for general writers in general, but one should be "ashamed" for a few old writers. (Here, I will preemptively leave a sentence to answer another counter-question: if I am also a writer, and if I can also be called old, I admit that I am one that cannot escape)

As for Mr. Fei Bai saying that there are too many "records of visiting generals and the like," I think this is a practical piece of advice. Taking a photo with a general, asking the general to write a few words or a poem, then composing one yourself, and then solemnly producing it in copperplate, the result is all unrelated to reportage literature. "Visits" are naturally important, but I think it is best to ask the soldiers more. More important material can certainly be obtained from the soldiers' surroundings, and that material will certainly enable the visitor to write "good reportage literature"—although it will not necessarily be "great reportage literature."

### Crossing the Wo River

— Li Qiao

——Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou

A few stars were scattered sparsely in the sky. A crescent moon rose from behind the woods, and the ground was covered with a mercury-like clear glow. The wheat seedlings had lost their tender greenness and vitality, and lay peacefully in the fields. Treading on the tree shadows that looked like light ink paintings reflected on the road, the team moved silently and quickly forward. In the villages near and far, there were occasional barks of dogs, as if enemies had passed through there.

With a tense heart ready to fight at any moment, I followed excitedly, wondering when we would pass through safely? It was said that there were several small villages scattered along the road where the enemy was lying in ambush.

The next morning, as the sun emitted its golden rays, the team reached the Xin Ting Road. To prevent enemy tanks from rushing in, the road had been dug up section by section. At this time, several civilians who heard that our team was going to pass this road were automatically digging earth to fill in the dug-up pits.

Touched by that rare enthusiasm, Commander Zhang took out thirty yuan and handed it to them:

"You've worked hard. Take this money and buy something to eat."

"You're helping us fight XX, how can we take your money?" The civilians clutched their hoes, smiling and refusing.

"Don't be polite!" Commander Zhang handed the money to a civilian. "Hurry up and dig, our heavy artillery is coming up behind us."

"Yes, yes." The civilians nodded and raised their hoes to dig.

Not far from the civilians, one or two vendors were selling a little paper cigarettes and the like by the roadside. At this time, the brothers who had retreated from southern Shandong and had not seen a civilian selling anything seemed to have seen some treasure, and they surrounded it in layers, vying to buy it. That rare bustle must have surprised the paper cigarette vendors!

After climbing over Long Mountain, which lay abruptly in the fields, we arrived at Longshan Town. The civilians standing by the street looked at us with a face full of fear, as if asking us if we were the enemy?

"Fellow villagers, don't be afraid! We are here to fight XX."

"Ah, you've worked hard!" A middle-aged man turned around and shouted to his family, "Don't be afraid, they are our troops, here to fight XX for us, hurry up and bring tea!"

"No need for tea, fellow villagers, just give us a drink of cold water!"

"Okay, bring out a bucket of cold water!"

Two tightly closed doors opened, and a little girl came out carrying a bucket of cold water. Then, this family and that family also opened their doors, carrying water out to comfort us.

Just sitting in front of a house drinking water, suddenly, an enemy plane flew over our heads and circled. The people and horses standing in the street hurriedly hid in people's homes. The enemy plane strafed with its machine gun for a while, and then flew away on its own without any result.

After resting in Longshan Town for a while, the team set off again under the fiery sun. There was no wind at all, and people were sweating profusely, and even their clothes were soaked with sweat.

Dragging a pair of feet that were soaked and rotten with yellow water, I walked laboriously on the scorching highway, thinking that we could satisfy our hunger for more than ten days when we reached Guoyang. Unexpectedly, when we reached Guoyang, the thousands upon thousands of houses had been bombed into scorched earth by enemy planes. Some of the houses were still emitting residual smoke, and the eyes were full of crying ruins and broken wood. There was not a single civilian. Ah, what shall we use to repay our enemies for this great feat of destruction?

Suddenly, the sound of machine guns rang out from behind. No need to tell: our brothers behind us must have come into contact with the enemy again!

The people and horses who had just arrived in Guoyang jumped into the overflowing Wo River one by one, wetting their clothes with water, wading across the Wo River, and then scattered and squatted in the trenches on the high ground outside the city...

Strangely, the sound of gunfire suddenly subsided.

### In German Concentration Camps (Part 1)

— Translated by Wan

Saying a few careless words in front of a close friend unexpectedly subjected me to seven months of terrifying detention by the Nazis. As a result, my weight decreased by forty pounds, and their power even trampled on my hometown.

When I was visiting my sister-in-law in Gotha-Reispai, I met an elderly woman who seemed very sympathetic to us when she heard that my wife and I were planning to move to the United States again to live. I earned some money by broadcasting on the radio, but recently, Goebbels' propaganda machine forbade me from being a performer, mainly because one of my ancestors seventy-five years ago married a Jew because of lack of foresight (?).

"Your unemployment is really unfortunate," a friend who came to visit my sister-in-law said. "Although you sing very well, you can only sing German songs!" She glanced at the wall, then half-smilingly pointed to Hitler's portrait, the most ardent insulter of the Jews.

"Alas, a performer!" I sighed sadly. My career as a performer is over!

Early one morning six days later, in my Munich residence, my wife and I were suddenly awakened by urgent knocking on the door. I opened the door, and two men in the well-known uniform stood in front of the door.

"Get dressed quickly and come with us!" they shouted wildly.

"Why?"

"You are not allowed to do anything anymore!"

I comforted my wife, telling her that I would probably be back in about an hour, but who knew that this was the last time I would see my wife for seven months! At the headquarters, I found that the woman who seemed to sympathize with me earlier was actually a Nazi Party member, and she felt that she had accomplished a task by reporting my mocking actions to the secret police.

In the next ten days, I saw the miserable inside story of four of the many prisons in Munich. The single-person cell that could only accommodate seven prisoners was now filled with twenty prisoners. One day, I asked the jailer about a question that often came to my mind: when can I be tried?

"Tried?" A ghostly person said angrily: "I have been waiting here for trial for nearly two years. I have been unemployed for a year since I joined the labor camp, and they insisted that they found a Communist newspaper in my labor utensils. In fact, I can tell you that I have never had this newspaper! I have been imprisoned here for two years without being tried!"

We had to scold him because he was speaking too loudly.

Another prisoner was a black-short-trousered guy from the fascist organization—the Schutzstaffel. He had been a guard at that terrible concentration camp outside Munich—Texas. All the friends he released to come here could see the terror that had intimidated everything in their eyes. To avoid more painful punishment, no one dared to tell his every horrible experience. The black-short-trousered kid had been detained in a Munich prison for two years for passing two cigarettes to the prisoner from Texas.

### Song of Winter

— Keting

Winter,

I sing of it.

Mad snow,

Storms,

How can they hinder the coming of spring?

The suburbs are a scene of desolation:

White clouds hang low,

Endless withered grass,

Bird tracks and beast footprints trample the earth.

Spring is the herald of life,

Winter will be the advance whip of the herald.

The haze is the bridge to clarity,

Winter will be the base point of the bridge.

If you do not traverse the arduous journey,

How can you reach the glorious shore?

Winter,

I sing of it.

Coldness, trembling, I have no share in them,

My heart is full of warmth.

Entertainment World

### Silver Screen News

— An Ran

Recently, among reports about movie news, three things seem worth mentioning:

(1) Central Propaganda Department Seeks Scripts on Atrocities: The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, in order to understand the truth about the atrocities of the Japanese army in various guerrilla areas, is specifically advertising for such scripts to be filmed and shown in the interior, so that the people in the interior can deeply understand the truth of the Japanese army in the occupied areas, as well as a glimpse of their atrocities, thereby enhancing the national consciousness and anti-Japanese awareness of the general public. It is said that a total of three scripts will be selected, with a prize of 300 yuan for the first place, 200 yuan for the second place, and 100 yuan for the third place. The deadline is March 31st of this year. Many playwrights in this city have already written manuscripts to apply. To avoid censorship, they are all entrusted to people to send them to Hong Kong and then mailed from Hong Kong.

(2) Film Industry Refuses to Cooperate with the Japanese: Iwai Aya, the president of the Japanese International Film News, is actively operating in this city, intending to ask various film companies to transport domestic films to various guerrilla areas for screening; at the same time, he also has the intention of seizing the Shanghai film censorship rights. However, the film industry in this city is deeply aware of the righteousness, and no matter how difficult or hard the environment is, they will never cooperate with the Japanese. Therefore, although the Japanese have repeatedly entertained the authorities of various film companies, there have been no results. It is said that the Japanese side once proposed that the film authorities produce films on their behalf; and the authorities of various companies replied: "As far as the company is concerned, it is acceptable to produce films on behalf of others, as long as a considerable price is obtained; however, the facilities of each company after the war must first be decided by all the staff, so the first step is to seek the consent of all the staff." This firm expression of refusal to cooperate is a particularly glorious page in the Shanghai film industry, and it is admirable in the process of national resistance.

(3) "Charlie Chaplin Arrives in Shanghai" Nearing Completion: Playwright Li Amao (also known as the humorous novelist Xu Zhuodai) has recently been commissioned by the Star Film Company to write a film script with "humor as the warp" and "anti-Japanese war as the weft," titled "Charlie Chaplin Arrives in Shanghai." Now, Dr. Amao is taking advantage of this school winter vacation opportunity to step up his work. The manuscript will be completed soon. The materials he collected are very humorous, making people laugh until their stomachs hurt. It is expected that it may be released in the spring of March or April. At that time, it will surely cause a sensation among the movie fans in the "isolated island," who will be eager to see it first.

### Yu Zhenting's Death and Brief Biography

— (Master of Guihua Hall)

This year is the year of death in the Peking opera world. Many contemporary famous actors have passed away one after another, including Yang Xiaolou and Wang Youchen. Now, news has come that Yu Zhenting, a famous martial artist of a generation, passed away at his home in Baishun Hutong, Qianmenwai, Beijing, on the 21st of this month, at the age of 60. According to Yu, he has given up Peking opera life since the 17th year of the Republic of China, and it has been eleven years now. His daily life is quite comfortable, and he enjoys teaching his children and grandchildren. In recent years, he has suffered from phlegm, which sometimes heals and sometimes flares up. Unexpectedly, he suffered from a cold a few days ago, which led to his death. Now, I will describe his life events below, so that everyone can see a glimpse of it.

Yu's Origins: Zhenting's grandfather was named Xiaoxia, who was a rare famous actor of Kunqu opera in his time. His son Jiusheng (i.e., Zhenting's father), also known as Runxian, had three sons: the eldest was Zhenting, the second was Zanting, and the third was Huating. Jiusheng's martial arts style formed its own school. Yang Xiaolou and Shang Heyu were both his disciples. There were also two others who were his successors (names are forgotten). Therefore, Zhenting's art was inherited from his father's true teachings. His

First Play: That is, in the hall of Yang Lishan's house in Beiping, he performed his masterpiece "The Leopard." The person who played the monkey was Chi Yueting. At that time, Yu was only eighteen years old, and his name became very popular. Yu once formed the Shuangqing Society in the old capital, and performed in the Civilization Garden every period. The famous plays he performed included Yanyang Tower, Picking Huache, Iron Cage Mountain, and The Leopard. Fan Baoting and Chi Yueting were both important roles in the troupe at that time. Since then, he has been invited to Shanghai, Nanjing, Fengtian, Tianjin and other ports many times, and all have been well received. After returning to Ping, he performed in the North China Theater (i.e., Civilization Garden). Soon after, he stopped performing due to illness, when he was one year short of fifty years old.

Cultivating Talents: He opened the Binqing Society around the 13th year of the Republic of China (or the 14th year). He performed in the Guangde Tower every period. The society cultivated many talents. Such as Xu Biyun, Zhao Qixia, Liu Chunsheng, Zhu Binxian, Liu Binsheng, Yu Bin'an, Geng Binfu, Xiao Guihua, Yu Binting, Wang Binfen, Li Binxian, Mao Qinglai, etc., no less than dozens of people. People outside the troupe, such as Li Wanchun, Wang Wenyuan, Yang Baosen, etc., also benefited a lot from the society. When he ran the Shuangqing Society, the people he promoted included Yu Lianquan (Xiao Cuihua), Mei Lanfang, Gao Zijun (Qingkui), Shang Xiaoyun (Qixia), etc. All benefited from him.

Friends in Need: Yu was bold and made friends. In the Peking opera world, there were many friends in need, such as Wang Yaoqing, Gai Jiaotian, Yu Shuyan, Chi Zijun, Chi Yueting, Li Chunlai, etc. In addition, he often helped people in the same industry financially. Therefore, his lifelong savings have been exhausted because of this.

Passed Away with a Smile: Recently, he suffered a severe illness. On the morning of the 21st of this month, his family knew that he would not recover. The funeral arrangements had already been made. At 12:00 noon, Yu summoned his family to his bedside. Because phlegm had risen, his words were mostly blurred. He probably said that his five sons should work hard to make progress, and he touched the head of his fourth son Shilong. He passed away with a smile at 5:30 p.m.

Huangbai Coffin: The coffin was bought from Henian Changzhe on Qianmenwai Street. The material was Huangbai, and the price was 800 yuan. The shroud and other things were from Ruifuxiang, and the price was more than 300 yuan.

Many people in the Peking opera world went to pay their respects after hearing the news. Yu's original wife, Cao, is still alive, but she no longer cares about family affairs. It is said that she was the daughter of a famous actor in those years. Yu married many concubines in his life, and three of them have died. His second concubine is the one who is in charge of the family affairs now, and she is very capable. Yu's coffin has been moved to the famous temple Sansheng Temple. The burial site will be chosen.

In order to communicate European and Asian drama, the Eurasia Song and Dance Drama Company has specially spent a lot of money to hire the world-renowned singers Alexander Valentine and Miguel Spranski. The former is good at high notes, and the beams and dust fall when he sings a song. The latter is famous for his bass, and his resentment and weeping are touching. The two stars have arrived in Shanghai as scheduled and will sing at the Lyceum Theatre on Meyer Road, Bubbling Well Road at 9:00 tonight (31st). Those who love music and songs can book a seat at the theatre or Moude Piano Company.

### The Process of Xiao's Play Being Adapted into a Movie (Part 2)

That friend lent him a thousand francs, and Pascal ran to Lute to meet the accountant (he was a lawyer in London). After ten negotiations, they still hadn't agreed. What should Pascal do? The lawyer charged a high price, requiring prepayment and requiring all guarantees, while the money in Pascal's pocket was getting less and less every day. Finally, all his money ran out. Walking along the Lute shipyard, he unintentionally saw a British cargo ship leaving for London within an hour.

"Where is the captain?" Pascal asked with a flash of inspiration.

"What are you asking him for?" A sailor in front of him replied. "He's probably in the tavern across the road?"

"Captain," the Hungarian begged the tall, generous man, "Only you can save my life, I will always be grateful to you."

Maska briefly told him his current situation. He received Bernard Shaw's reply, and his consultation with Bernard Shaw's accountant was unsuccessful.

"If you take me to London, I will be able to meet Bernard Shaw. As long as I see him, all the problems can be solved in half an hour."

Thirty hours later, Pascal arrived in London and went to Bernard Shaw's home.

"I'm Gottfried Pascal," he said. "I'm here to ask you to sign this contract yourself, because your accountant, although very good at doing business, I can't get along with him. You think, he dragged our negotiations on for more than ten days, and I can't get a penny out of my pocket. In fact, I'm now asking the captain of a cargo ship to bring me to London to see you."

Bernard Shaw laughed out loud when he heard these words. The two then talked for a while and drank a glass or two of whiskey. Bernard Shaw signed the filming rights of "Pygmalion" to Habasga on the back of the envelope of that letter.

This film is being made in London - a new producer is moving towards success. (Translated from Magazine Digest)

Singing of Sending a Son on Stage, Crying for Brothers Under the Stage

Later, when I saw Deng Bodao tying his own son to a tree and carrying his nephew away, I couldn't hold back my tears anymore and started crying loudly. Moreover, when I heard the clapper board writing the blood letter, it seemed that every word was cursing me, giving me an excellent lesson and making me feel guilty; so I wanted to go home immediately, find my brother back, not only to apologize to him, but also to open a list of ancestral inheritance and let him choose whatever he wanted, and the rest would belong to me. Only in this way can I be worthy of my dead parents and my own conscience. After saying this, the man left in a hurry. According to his neighbors (neighbors in Beiping are called street neighbors), this kind gentleman really did what he said. From this, we can know how great the power of dramatic influence is; at the same time, how profound Tan Xinpei's acting skills are. So I say that Lao Tan is a great social educator, and perhaps no one will object to this statement.

Lao Yu's Bronze Fan and Iron Crutch Weigh About Thirty Pounds

Many older people in the Peking opera business like to get up early. When they walk out of their homes, they are either carrying birdcages, holding crutches, or holding long-stemmed pipes, and there are gourds in their arms, (gourd is called brother) spinning two purple and bright round walnuts in their palms, and more than a dozen singing without stopping, and the walnuts in their hands are clacking, as if they are playing the board. These colorful predecessors of the Peking opera world all go to Nancheng Gen, Yaotai, Xian Nongtan, and Tianqiao to breathe some fresh air, hang their birdcages on big pine trees, and compete to see whose bird sings the loudest and longest. People who carry gourds also take them out of their arms and put them in the sun, feed them some food, and everyone sits on the very clean sandy ground, talking about the grand events of the Tianbao years; on the other hand, they sigh about their own life experience and the lack of talents in the Peking opera world in recent years. There are also those who are too old and have received the grace of the Empress Dowager Cixi, who always repeat the benefits of the old Buddha. After a short while, more pedestrians come, and their morning lessons are over. This kind of daily exercise is just like morning exercises for young people. It is really an excellent way to keep healthy, so there are really many people who enjoy high age.
