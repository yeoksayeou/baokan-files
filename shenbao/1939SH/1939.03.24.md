### Wu City Battle Gradually Stabilizing, River Repair, Two Armies Confronting, Chinese Dominance

Fierce Battle for Many Days, Japanese Corpses Pile Up by the Thousands, Chinese Army Enters Strong Position

Japanese Planes Bombard Frantically, One Shot Down, Remainder Flee Wounded

(Changde) Military authorities received a telegram from Nanchang stating that large groups of Japanese planes took turns bombarding the Xiushui area all day long in batches, covering Japanese troops in battle. In the Nanchang-Xunyang Road battle, the Chinese and Japanese sides are now confronting each other at the San Gong Ferry on the Xiushui River. The situation is extremely fierce, and the Chinese side still holds the advantage. (Telegram of the 23rd)

(Chongqing) Sources here claim that the Japanese clearly intend to advance on Nanchang and are now dividing their forces into six routes to advance on Nanchang. The main force is attacking the Yongxiu area, and the battle has now expanded from Duchang on the east bank of Poyang Lake to Wucheng on the west bank, and continues to expand westward through Yongxiu, Qiujin, Ruoxi, and Wuning. (Reuters telegram of the 23rd)

(Nanchang) On the 21st, Japanese planes bombed the south bank of the Xiushui River several times. The Chinese anti-aircraft units gave them fierce fire. One Japanese plane was hit, caught fire, and immediately fell in front of the Chinese position. Many of the remaining planes were also damaged and fled in a sorry state. (Telegram of the 23rd)

(Hong Kong) It is reported that the situation in northern Jiangxi is tense. On the west bank of Yongxiu, near Qiujin, the Japanese army shelled all day on the 20th. In the evening, the Japanese army crossed the Xiushui River in several places and is now engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. The situation in the Shishi Mountain area is unclear. The Chinese army at Shangtantou and Luopan Mountain in the northeast of Wuning in the upper reaches of the Xiushui River has shifted its position, and the Japanese army has reached the line of Danaojian and Huijiashan in the west. (Special dispatch from Jishi on the afternoon of the 23rd)

(Hankou) The Chinese army is exerting pressure to stop the Japanese army from crossing the Xiushui River. It is reported that the two sides are holding each other in Ziluqiao and Xingshuilong south of Xiushui. The battle line has been extended to 20 kilometers. It is reported that the Chinese army is setting up artillery positions at Anlongqiao south of Yongxiu, and is annihilating a group of Japanese mobile units that have sneaked into Anyi. It is reported that the Chinese side has gathered a large number of troops on the Anshi-Wanjiafu highway, enough to block the Japanese army's advance, and there are even more heavy troops gathered in the area north of Nanchang. Also, the Japanese army on the Wuning road has suffered a disastrous defeat. No fewer than 650 of them have been annihilated by the Chinese army, and there are more than 1,000 Japanese corpses floating in the Xiushui River, all sacrificed during the forced crossing. (Express News Agency telegram of the 23rd)

Guilin About 20,000 Japanese troops with more than ten tanks invaded the Ruoxi Daqiaohe area in two routes: one route advanced westward from Daqiaohe and the other attacked westward along the Ruoxi Highway. (Telegram of the 23rd)

(Chongqing) The Japanese army's ambition to attack Nanchang in northern Jiangxi is becoming more and more obvious. On the 21st, the 6th and 106th Divisions, totaling 20,000 men, were used as the main force, and they attacked Wuning on the bank of the Xiushui River in several routes with all their strength. The two sides then launched an unprecedented bloody battle. The Chinese army resisted desperately, and the Japanese army made no progress until late at night, and was still confronting each other in the Chenzhuang area outside Wuning. On the morning of the 21st, General Luo Zhuoying, commander of the Chinese army, personally rode to the front line to supervise the battle. Reinforcements also arrived in large numbers, so the morale of the Chinese army in the front of northern Jiangxi was greatly boosted. On the same day, they began a counterattack and launched a bayonet charge with the Japanese army. At the same time, a part of the Chinese army secretly crossed the Xiushui River and outflanked the Japanese artillery position. After a fierce battle, the Japanese Ikeda unit was defeated and more than 700 were killed. The remnants of the Japanese army abandoned their weapons and fled. The Chinese army then intercepted 32 artillery pieces, but because they could not be carried, they placed explosives and destroyed them all. When the Japanese army arrived, the Chinese army had safely returned to its position. (Express News Agency telegram of the 23rd)

(Hong Kong) Although the Japanese side here is promoting that it has made progress on the Nanchang-Xunyang Road and has occupied Anyi, according to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is still being blocked at Shenjiabu. The port is located 22 kilometers west of Yongxiu. The Japanese army seems to attach great importance to the military strategic position of Shenjiabu. It has repeatedly attacked the place with tanks, but has failed. Only some mobile infantry units have sneaked into Anlongqiao and Xiamayuan and other places, but after being discovered by the Chinese army, they were immediately annihilated. The Japanese army, seeing that the Chinese army's resistance on the land was strong and unable to make progress, tried to open a bloody path with the air force. Therefore, in recent days, it has sent more than 80 planes to bomb the rear of the Chinese army. (Express News Agency telegram of the 23rd)

(Nanchang) The battle in Wucheng is gradually stabilizing. Since the morning of the 18th, two small Japanese ships and thirty or forty motorboats sailed from Xingzi and shelled Wucheng more than 500 times. Most of the houses in the city were destroyed. At noon, more than 200 Japanese troops attempted to land on Yejiuzhou, and fierce artillery battles broke out between the two sides. One small Japanese warship and three or four motorboats were sunk by the Chinese army, and the Japanese flames were slightly diminished. On the morning of the 19th, five or six hundred Japanese troops changed their landing site to Linggongzhou in the northwest of Wucheng, and then fled south to Hexilong. After half a day of fierce fighting, a part of Hexilong was occupied by the Japanese army. In the afternoon of the same day, the Chinese army counterattacked and recovered Hexilong. On the morning of the 20th, the Japanese army changed its landing site to the area of Longtoushan Songmenshan (about 20 li northeast of Wucheng). The area protruded into the lake, and the Chinese defenders fought hard until noon and moved to a new position. The Japanese army continued to invade Jishan, and the fighting was very fierce. At about 3 p.m., the Chinese side abandoned Jishan. On the morning of the same day, under the cover of Japanese planes and fierce artillery fire and poison gas, the Japanese army once again landed at Wanjun Temple west of Hexilong. Two or three hundred Japanese troops also landed and have been annihilated by the Chinese army. (Telegram of the 22nd)

Japanese Warships Constantly Bombarding Zhenhai

One Large Warship Destroyed

Jinhua A certain unit of the Chinese army crossed the Fuchun River from a certain place at dawn on the 23rd and counterattacked Dongzhou.

Jinhua Japanese warships on the Zhejiang Sea have been harassing constantly for days, in order to echo the Japanese army landing on Dongzhou. The day before yesterday morning, six Japanese warships suddenly sailed into the Lijiang sea off Zhenhai and fired more than 500 shells at the shore. Knowing that the Chinese oil was prepared, they fled east. Yesterday afternoon, four more Japanese warships fired more than 100 shells at the coast of Zhenhai. After being counterattacked by the Chinese army, one large Japanese warship was severely damaged and the Japanese warships fled. Also, one large warship and two small warships arrived near Damenshan, Yuhuan yesterday. Four Japanese planes took off from the warship and scouted the Taiwan-Wen area.

Xingji At the beginning of this month, Japanese troops from Taiyuan, Xinxian, Qingyuan and other places gathered 7,000 troops and divided into areas west of Taiyuan. After fierce fighting for ten days, 400 Japanese troops were killed, one was captured, and dozens of machine guns were seized. He Kou, Gu Jiao, Guan Kou, Bai Hu and other places were recaptured successively. Now the Japanese army only occupies Wang Fengzhen.

### Chairman Chiang Believes That He Can Conduct An Indefinite Protracted War of Resistance Against Japan

Japan Attempts to Organize the Import of Military Supplies into China

But There is Still a Sufficient Supply of Munitions Coming in Steadily

(Washington) Washington diplomatic sources today, based on recent secret reports from the Chinese mainland, declared that China's unity has increased, and Chairman Chiang can conduct an indefinite protracted war against Japan. In recent weeks, although the situation in Europe has been extremely tense, the opportunity for China to extend its organized war of resistance against Japan has not been affected. Although the Japanese side has tried various methods to prevent the import of military supplies into the Chinese mainland, China still has a sufficient supply of military supplies coming in steadily. The Soviet Union also has a large number of munitions being shipped to China. Foreign observers in China are very impressed with the war of resistance of the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army, which has been trained in guerrilla warfare, will continue to be an obstacle to the Japanese army in China. According to diplomatic sources, after the fall of Guangzhou, more central troops were sent to southern China than expected. The news that the Japanese army has increased its garrison on the Soviet-Russian border does not attract the special attention of officials, because the "alarms" on the border have always calmed down in an instant. Officials believe that a serious dispute is expected to occur in Europe, and their eyes are focused on the development of the situation in Europe, while the actions of the Japanese army on the Soviet border are less likely to attract attention.

### Great Victory of the Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu

More Than 300 Japanese Soldiers Killed in a Fierce Battle at Zhaoguan Dam

Four Motorboats Sunk and a Large Number of Arms and Ammunition Seized

They rushed to a certain place nearby and were fiercely counterattacked by the Chinese defenders, who drove the Japanese army back. The Chinese army still defends the line north of a certain place. (Telegram of the 21st)

### Saying That Foreign Minister Wang Resigned is a Rumor Made by the Japanese

(Chongqing) A certain foreign reporter, claiming that the Japanese side declared that Foreign Minister Wang had resigned and went to Hong Kong, and said that the reason for the resignation was a disagreement with the central government, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the truth. It happened that Foreign Minister Wang was in the ministry and was received and said that this was purely a rumor made by the Japanese and not worth laughing at. The Japanese claimed last December that I had gone to Hanoi, and now they say that I have resigned and gone to Hong Kong. In fact, since I came to Chongqing from Wuhan at the end of July last year, I have not left Chongqing a single step. The Japanese rumors can be self-defeating. As for my handling of foreign affairs, it is entirely based on the central government's policies, and at the same time, I deeply believe that the central bank's policies are the only way to resist Japan and build the country. What the Japanese said that I disagree with the central government and have resigned is all fabricated, deceiving others and deceiving oneself. (Telegram of the 22nd)

### Japanese Attacking Units in Central Hubei Withdraw for Reorganization

Fancheng On the Central Hubei front, the Japanese army has withdrawn its attacking units for reorganization.

Yesterday, the Chinese army in Yujiadian and Guojiadian took advantage of the Japanese army's weakness and launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army, and the result was that the Chinese side recaptured it. (Telegram of the 23rd)

(Yichang) On the evening of the 22nd, the Japanese army at Luohan Temple used dozens of civilian boats and rubber boats full of Japanese soldiers to steal across the Han River.

Editorial

### The Question of British and French Credibility

The world is consumed with anxiety and fear that war is imminent, a situation that has persisted for quite some time. Crisis lurks at every turn, and people cling to the hope of maintaining the status quo, wishing for all parties to act with caution to prevent a spark from igniting the powder keg. Yet, just a few days ago, the German leader, Herr Hitler, seized Czechoslovakia and strangled it. What sort of action is this? The ink from the Munich agreement guaranteeing the remaining territory of Czechoslovakia is not yet dry, and the National Socialist Party's banner of racial supremacy remains aloft. Can England, France, and even the Soviet Union and the United States not react in anger, considering this latest outrage an unbearable offense? Thus, those who are upright and conscientious lament the impending retribution to befall the German people, and grieve even more for the calamity that threatens all of humanity. Driven to this point, everyone believes that the fuse has been lit and that an explosion is imminent. But Hitler remains unperturbed, and without a moment's rest, he presses on, again demanding from Lithuania, with an air of gentle persuasion, the Memel region. He obtains it with a single demand. This is his response to the international clamor, declaring, "I will do as I please, and the facts speak for themselves." This is his reassurance to the world's anxiety, saying, "I have placed Memel under the swastika without firing a shot or spilling a drop of blood; there is no cause for alarm."

Over the past year, the state of the world and the hearts of men have undergone dramatic changes. Borders have shifted, maps have changed color, the strong and the weak have parted ways, and influence has waxed and waned. International relations have lost their established order, and humanity has lost its shared faith. Commentators often point to Germany, Italy, and Japan as discarding morality, violating treaties, acting perversely, and breaking promises, leading to the collapse of order and the recurrence of calamities. However, when tracing back to the root and source of the problem, when assigning blame to the ringleaders and holding them responsible, Germany, Italy, and Japan must bear the full responsibility, and Japan cannot escape the condemnation of future generations. However, strictly speaking, while their punishable violation of the rules is clear, can those who condone and enable it be excused? Japan trampled on Liaoning, but where were the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty? Italy used force against Abyssinia, but where were the sanctions of the League of Nations? Germany coveted the Sudetenland, but the League of Nations remained silent, and where were France and the Soviet Union, who had treaties with Czechoslovakia? During the Spanish Civil War, it was obvious that foreign powers were assisting the rebellion with their armies, yet they blockaded the borders and prohibited the export of weapons, posing as law-abiding and righteous nations. Then, Japan closed the door in Manchuria, Italy refused to withdraw its volunteer soldiers, and Germany annexed Czechoslovakia and Austria. All nations failed to fulfill their promised and inherent responsibilities, and disregarded the sanctity of their treaty obligations. Thus, events have unfolded repeatedly to the present day. Therefore, it can be said that those who actively discard morality, violate treaties, act perversely, and break promises, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, are truly criminals against human civilization. But the countries of England and France, by their neglect of responsibility and abandonment of duty, are also seriously guilty of passively causing the loss of international order and the loss of faith among humanity. Retribution is inevitable, and some will be slapped in the face directly. Is it possible that those who are clear in condemning Germany, Italy, and Japan, but blind to their own failings, can abandon their apathy and act decisively?

In today's world, Germany, Italy, and Japan are seen as aggressor nations, either deeply hated and loathed, or regarded with caution and guarded against. This is a common sentiment, a common attitude. The only nation to defy them, to strike at their vulnerable spots, is the Republic of China. If there is any hope of limiting the expansion and resisting the aggression of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it lies with England and France. England and France have so far done little, but any nation that might be subjected to aggression by Germany, Italy, and Japan places great importance on gaining the favor of England and France. This is dictated by the circumstances, and is also a matter of course. England then acts with self-restraint, considering itself to bear a heavy responsibility to the world. The United States sympathizes, and regards England and France as the pillars of democracy, seeing them as objects of support. However, England readily offered guarantees to the Nordic countries, only to be met with a cold response from Norway. It drafted a collective declaration, only to be rejected by Poland's insistence on isolation. This shows that while Germany, Italy, and Japan are undeniably to blame for destroying international norms and shaking the common faith of humanity, a widespread destruction and shaking have already taken place, and even England and France cannot remain unscathed. Is this not the beginning of a great calamity for mankind?

According to a Norwegian dispatch from the 20th, after Norway learned that Britain had expressed its willingness to guarantee the safety of the Nordic countries, the Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament, Hambro, responded by saying, "We have neither sought guarantees nor do we hope that any one country or several countries will guarantee the security of our country in any form." He also said that he had never believed in promises of international security. According to a London dispatch from the 21st, France and Russia had no problem with the collective security declaration drafted by Britain, but Poland refused to participate, saying that it had already reached agreements with France and could contact Romania at any time. Its true intention was that the declaration was not reliable and would only offend Germany, which was unacceptable. Are security guarantees and joint declarations not major undertakings aimed at addressing an unfavorable reality? Are Norway and Poland not weak and small countries that lack the ability to defend themselves and rely on strong support? Given this attitude, it is clear that the common rules of international conduct and the shared faith of mankind have been completely lost, and must be re-established before they can be effective again. Germany, Italy, and Japan should not be blamed; the key lies in England and France fulfilling their responsibilities and shouldering their obligations from now on. Only then can there be hope for clarifying the international situation. Is it not because Hitler has seen through the empty words and inaction of England and France that he acts so recklessly and disregards everything?

### Central Executive Committee Resolution: Outline for "March 29th" Propaganda

Carry on the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, fulfilling their legacy of nation-building.

(Chongqing) The Fifth Session of the Central Executive Committee on March 1st resolved the memorial propaganda outline for the "March 29th" Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs as follows:

(A) Significance of "March 29th"
(1) The "March 29th" Huanghuagang Uprising was the prelude to the revolution. Due to this uprising, it shook both domestically and internationally, and actually stirred up a nationwide revolutionary upsurge of the people to overthrow the Manchu Qing autocratic government.
(2) The loyalty, courage, and sacrifice of the "March 29th" Seventy-Two Martyrs were the inspiration of revolutionary personality and the practical consciousness of the Three Principles of the People.
(3) The revolutionary martyrs of "March 29th" exhausted their efforts to overthrow the corrupt Manchu Qing autocratic government and establish a republic based on the Three Principles of the People.
(4) The "March 29th" uprising proved that overseas Chinese had a significant contribution and role in the construction movement of the new China, and also proved that only with a great spirit can material be used to establish a great cause.

(B) The Course of "March 29th"
The "March 29th" Huanghuagang Uprising was a follow-up to the failed uprising of the Guangdong New Army two years before the founding of the Republic of China. The location of the uprising was in Guangzhou, and the general headquarters for planning the uprising was set up in Hong Kong. Huang Xing served as the commander-in-chief, and Xie Liangmu raised tens of thousands of shields in funding from overseas Chinese in Nanyang. At the time of the uprising, Huang Xing led more than a hundred comrades to attack the Governor-General's Office. Later, due to the Guangdong Governor-General Zhang Mingqi dispatching troops to encircle and suppress them, they failed quickly. Later, the Guangdong Governor-General implemented even more terror policies, and Party members and civilians with their hair cut off were arrested and killed in large numbers. However, the more severe the oppression, the more violent the resistance. The doctrine had already penetrated the hearts of the people, and the revolutionary trend could not be stopped in the end. Therefore, there was the follow-up of the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th to carry forward the unfinished legacy of the martyrs and establish the foundation of the Republic of China.

(C) Current tasks to commemorate "March 29th"
(1) To inherit the indomitable and heroic spirit of struggle of the revolutionary martyrs of "March 29th", firmly believe in the "inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, and the inevitable success of nation-building, without seeking momentary ease, without fearing difficulties, and resisting until the end. All agencies and groups nationwide must deeply publicize the spirit of sacrifice of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang and the martyrs to all officers and soldiers nationwide, and to the people across the country, implement the General Mobilization of the National Spirit, so that everyone deeply recognizes the final victory, and so that the whole country understands "Compromise in the middle is destruction," firmly establish a common faith, and encourage their participation in the War of Resistance.
(2) The revolutionary martyrs' correct understanding, great sacrifice, created the Republic of China. Currently, the enemy not only wants to destroy our country but also wants to destroy our race. At this time, to commemorate the martyrs, everyone should actively enlist in the army, rise up to participate in the War of Resistance, drive out the enemy, and recover lost territories.
(3) The revolutionary martyrs' strategy, in this uprising to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, utilized the Qing government's internal contradictions, penetrated into various places, and won over the Qing government's troops. Now that we are fighting against the Japanese invaders, we should also intensify propaganda against the enemy puppets, mobilize them to go behind enemy lines, win over the puppet troops, and disintegrate the enemy.
(4) One of the great recognitions of the revolutionary martyrs was to advocate the equality and mutual assistance of all ethnic groups in the country. Currently, our sacred War of Resistance is not only a war of resistance for the whole people, but also a war of resistance for the unity of all ethnic groups in the country. This is to intensify the awakening of ethnic minorities in the country and strengthen the unity of ethnic minorities in the country to respond to the enemy's conspiracy to divide.
(5) The revolutionary martyrs carried out continuous propaganda and organization movements among overseas Chinese, and obtained great assistance from overseas Chinese. This valuable experience makes us absolutely unable to forget the position of overseas Chinese in the War of Resistance. In fact, overseas Chinese have contributed a lot of strength since the War of Resistance. We should also continue to strengthen our work for overseas compatriots, especially to make the most use of overseas Chinese capital to carry out the construction of the national defense economy.

(D) Our slogans are:
(1) Commemorate "March 29th" to inherit the spirit of sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs.

### The Puppet Envoys of Beiping Leave for Japan Today

Request the Japanese Government to Control the Economy of North China

(Beiping) According to the minutes of the "Provisional Government" released today, the economic envoys visiting Japan will leave here for Japan on the 22nd. In general terms, their mission is almost entirely to request the Japanese government to control the entire economy of North China. The trade issues they plan to discuss with the Japanese side include: (1) customs tariff issues regarding rayon, semi-silk, semi-wool, electrical machinery, locomotives, agricultural machinery, and marine fertilizers; (2) the standards for assessing tariffs. According to the minutes, their hope is to restore the ad valorem export tariffs, while the tariffs on various goods must be the same as those implemented in "Manchukuo," such as duty-free wool, and reduced tariffs on coal and charcoal. In addition, all goods that are not produced in North China but are unique to South China will be exempted or reduced in import tariffs. As for the import tariffs on wheat flour, they will be increased to encourage production. Furthermore, the customs gold unit system will be abolished and replaced by the banknotes of the "Preparation Bank." In addition, the issues to be discussed with the Japanese side include: (1) import tariffs on daily necessities for the general public in North China, such as various machines, fertilizers, hats, shirts, spices, soda, medicines, etc.; (2) how to promote trade between Japan and China, such as the export of wool, cotton, iron salt, etc., and the import of manufactured goods and medicines.

### Japanese Prisoners of War Zhongshan Bao and Others Participate in Frugality and Offerings

And Published an Essay Describing the Significance of the Offerings

(Xi'an) This decision on the frugality offering movement, all walks of life actively participate, the situation is very enthusiastic. The prisoners in the prisoner-of-war camp heard about it and were very moved. After the prisoners Zhongshan Bao and others voluntarily requested, they were allowed to fast and participate in the offering to express their condolences. It is estimated that Zhongshan Bao's five-day fasting cost one yuan, and Mori Shitakuro, Tanaka Teruko (Korean female prisoner), and others' two-day fasting cost a total of two yuan and eight cents. The total is three yuan and eight cents. Zhongshan Bao also wrote an article on frugality offerings, describing the great significance of the offering, as follows: According to the director, dear Chinese comrades, are all implementing frugality offerings. After I heard about it, I immediately asked the director to save my food expenses to defeat the Japanese warlords and plutocrats who disturb East Asia and continue the war of aggression. I was allowed. I am now implementing the following well-known words: During the European War, the French people, in the face of the urgent situation, worked in the rear and did national salvation work. For the sake of the country, even if it fell into poverty, there was no dissatisfaction. The whole body was frugal and diligent in their duties. In addition, in the countryside, there is the following budget for the harvest of agricultural products. For example, in the harvest of wheat (four bales), in addition to various national taxes, agricultural taxes, fertilizer costs, and food, from the remaining (one bale), frugal offerings, and then use barley or oats as food to maintain family life, until the victory of the Great War, true peace, and the comfort and happiness of the people are achieved. I am willing to be a sacrifice for the comfort and happiness of the Chinese and Japanese people and the peace of East Asia, and strive to defeat the imperialist warlords and plutocrats. This is my oath to my dear Chinese compatriots. The victory of the Chinese army is achieved through hard work. I think that the country's concerted efforts and frugal offerings are more important than anything else. Therefore, for frugal offerings, from now on, we must intensify our efforts to encourage and implement them. This is what I silently pray for and request in front of my Chinese compatriots. March of the 28th year of the Republic of China, respectfully written by Zhongshan Bao. (Dispatch from the 22nd)

### General Cheng Qian Was Never Injured

(Chongqing) The Japanese side claimed that when Japanese planes bombed Lanzhou on February 23, General Cheng Qian, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese Northwest Army, was injured and died of his injuries on Tuesday. It is said here that this is purely unfounded. According to responsible sources speaking to Reuters reporters, General Cheng Qian was not in Lanzhou on February 23, and Cheng was never injured in this battle. It is generally believed here that the origin of this statement is that when Japanese planes bombed Xi'an earlier this month, several bombs fell directly into Cheng's air-raid shelter, and the door of the shelter was bombed. After clearing the rubble, Cheng was able to leave the shelter. Due to the lack of air in the shelter, he felt slightly unwell, but was not injured. He soon returned to his office to work.

### Hitler Arrives in Memel, Says Old Grievances Have Been Avenged, Germany and Lithuania Sign Transfer Agreement, Berlin Observes "Spring Movement" Completed

Memel. Führer Hitler arrived off the port here this morning at 10:00 aboard the battleship "Deutschland", and immediately transferred to a destroyer to enter the port. When he landed, German troops were heavily guarded, and he was immediately greeted by Heinrich Himmler, head of the German political police, Interior Minister Frick, and Dr. Neumann, the leader of the German ethnic group in the Memel Autonomous Region. The Führer is scheduled to deliver a speech in the city center at 1:00 p.m. The entire city is flying the German flag to celebrate, and more than 30 German aircraft are circling over the city. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)

(Berlin) Members of the German mechanized police force and the National Socialist Party's security guards successively entered the Memel area last night. Interior Minister Frick arrived in the area this morning with many National Socialist Party leaders, and Neumann, the leader of the German ethnic group in the area, immediately went to welcome them and hold a handover ceremony. Frick and Neumann then stood side by side in a car and gave the National Socialist Party salute to the public. Following that, German army troops carrying artillery and anti-aircraft guns arrived. Residents of the Memel area generally cheered enthusiastically. Members of the National Socialist Party engineering corps, youth corps, and military bands then entered. The cruiser "Deutschland", with a squadron escorting Führer Hitler, also arrived outside the port of Memel. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)

(Berlin) Führer Hitler and Dr. Neumann, leader of the German ethnic group in the Memel area, recently delivered speeches to the local people in the city center of Memel, which were broadcast by the local radio station. Dr. Neumann said that the Memel area was opened up by Germans 700 years ago, and now it is fortunate that Führer Hitler has brought it back into German territory. Führer Hitler then replied, expressing his gratitude to the local people for not forgetting their motherland, and said that you were previously abandoned by the dim-witted German authorities, and now you have returned to your motherland. Our country has now decided to control its own destiny with its own strength. Although this is not welcomed by other countries, it is still ignored. The new Germany now has a population of 80 million, and you must be prepared to share its joys and sorrows. Based on our 20 years of experience, we know very well how the world treats us. The damage we have suffered in the past has now been started to be compensated, and the main part will be completed. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)

(Berlin) Regarding the Memel Autonomous Region issue, the Lithuanian delegation, led by the country's Foreign Minister Ubšys, arrived here this afternoon at 4:30 in two planes, and was greeted by German Deputy Foreign Minister Weizsäcker and Director of Protocol Döenpe. After the delegation disembarked, they immediately went to the Foreign Ministry to hold talks with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and then signed a treaty. The main points are: (1) Lithuania will return the Memel area to Germany; (2) Lithuanian troops and police will withdraw immediately; (3) The area will be opened as a free port for Lithuania's use; (4) Both parties agree to avoid the use of force and do not allow third countries to use violence against one of the signatory countries. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)

(Berlin) There is now a growing impression in political circles here that Germany's "spring movement" has now been completed. A Reuters correspondent learned that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other important figures are now planning to rest temporarily until Hitler's birthday on April 20. Hitler is departing from the port of Swinemünde tonight aboard the German cruiser "Deutschland" to Memel. The reason for deciding to go by sea is to avoid setting foot on German lost territory, such as the Polish Corridor. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

### British Newspapers Reappear, French Newspapers Say There Will Be Endless Troubles

(London) British newspapers attach great importance to Germany's annexation of Memel, saying that Hitler made a solemn promise last September not to make any more territorial demands in Europe. Now he has repeatedly broken his promises and Memel has finally been occupied. Although its method of annexation did not destroy Lithuania's sovereignty, and differed from that applied to Czechoslovakia, it did not ease the seriously tense situation. (Reuters dispatch from the 23rd)

(Paris) The return of the Memel area to Germany has recently been commented on by various newspapers, which all said that German Führer Hitler's eastward plan is gradually being realized. The right-wing Paris Echo said, "After Germany annexes Memel, the encirclement of Poland is completed, the path to advance to the Soviet Union is opened up, and National Socialist Germany and Soviet Russia will soon be connected, which is a new situation in 20 years. From then on, sooner or later, the two countries, representing two races, two doctrines, and two concepts, will have a head-on conflict, which is only a matter of time, but the European political situation may be completely changed because of this." The right-wing Petit Journal said, "Memel's return to Germany is following the historical path and promoting the traditional eastward policy, because Germany has always had two paths for expansion, one progressing from the southeast Danube River and the other progressing to the northeast Baltic Sea." The right-wing Figaro said, "Germany is continuing to advance into Eastern Europe and has occupied new strongholds on the Baltic coast, which is enough to directly threaten Poland." The right-wing Temps said, "While England and France are working hard to establish a collective security system, Führer Hitler has replied." The moderate-wing Ordre said, "Germany's move will certainly be justified by upholding justice and fairness." The communist L'Humanité said, "If we look at the map of Europe and compare the position of Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement with the position of Poland after the return of the Memel area to Germany, we will find that Czechoslovakia constituted a protruding point at that time, which Germany could not tolerate. Now Poland has once again constituted a protruding point, which Germany is also unwilling to tolerate." (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)

### Romania and Hungary Ease Tensions

Reserve Forces May Be Demobilized

Bucharest - According to sources in government circles here, Germany is attempting to ease tensions along the Hungarian-Romanian border. It is reported that Germany is applying pressure on Hungary to reduce the number of its troops on alert. If Hungary does so, Romania will follow suit. (Reuter, 23rd)

Romania - Prime Minister Armand Călinescu, in a recent statement to the press, said that the government's call-up of several classes of reservists was a precautionary measure. These troops have not been deployed near the border, nor will they be sent there. It is hoped that in ten days or half a month, the international situation will ease and they will be demobilized. (Havas, 22nd)

### Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands Uneasy; Most Gold Shipped to London and New York

(London) - Newspapers here recently reported that a Belgian plane carrying a large quantity of gold arrived here yesterday. More shipments are expected to arrive in the coming days. This is due to the Belgian authorities' desire to move the country's cash reserves to a safe location. The financial section of the Min Sheng Daily also reported that Switzerland and the Netherlands have also shipped most of their national reserves to London and New York for storage. (Havas, 23rd)

### British Home Secretary Hoare Explains German Threat to Lithuania

(London) - British Home Secretary Hoare, representing Prime Minister Chamberlain, explained today the circumstances of Germany's annexation of Memel. He said that Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys, while in Berlin, received a demand that Lithuania cede Memel to Germany immediately. If Lithuania refused or sought help from elsewhere, Germany would take military action. If Lithuania accepted the demand, Germany would make no further demands. (Laughter in the audience.) This was tantamount to an ultimatum. It is reported that Lithuania has yielded. Since the demand was made, the Lithuanian government has not contacted the British government. Labour leader Henderson asked Hoare to note that Britain was a signatory to the 1924 Memel Convention and asked whether the British government intended to protest or take other action. Hoare replied that Prime Minister Chamberlain intended to make a more detailed statement and asked for patience. (Reuter, 22nd)

### Japan Holds Five-Minister Conference to Discuss New Diplomacy

Arita Very Busy Again

Togo Meets Russian Foreign Minister Again

(Tokyo) - Well-informed sources here claim that the Japanese government may soon decide on a new diplomatic policy to cope with the situation created by Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia.

After meeting with Harada, Arita held a secret discussion with Army Minister Itagaki. On Tuesday, Arita again met with Prime Minister Hiranuma to exchange views on diplomatic affairs, a conversation that lasted for an hour. This was followed by last night's five-minister conference. Arita has been active every day since Sunday. (Reuter, 23rd)

(Moscow) - Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo today held his twentieth meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov regarding the fisheries issue. According to sources here, the Japanese side still believes that a final resolution can be reached. It is reported that Togo told Litvinov he would participate in the fishing ground auction to be held in Vladivostok on April 3. The nature of the guarantees Togo requested is not yet known. (Reuter, 22nd)

(Moscow) - Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo visited Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today and told foreign reporters that the Japanese government is willing to participate in the second fishing ground auction to be held in Vladivostok on April 3, but the Soviet Union must provide certain unspecified guarantees. It is understood that the Soviet Foreign Minister received the Japanese Ambassador and discussed the fisheries issue for 90 minutes, but there were no developments. At the first fishing ground auction held in Vladivostok on March 15, 293 fishing grounds were prepared for sale, but only four were sold. Of these, 255 had previously belonged to the Japanese side. The Japanese side did not send representatives to the previous auction. After the first auction, Japan protested to the Soviet Union against the unilateral auction of fishing grounds.

### US Takes a Watchful Attitude Toward the European Situation

Waiting for a Coalition of Democratic Nations

Revising the Neutrality Act

(Washington) - US political figures anticipated the return of the Memel Autonomous Region to Germany several days ago and were not surprised by the news. It is said that Führer Hitler will continue his usual tactics, and that after the Memel region, other areas may be sacrificed. Given this situation, the United States must revise the current Neutrality Act to help democratic nations. However, there is no need to rush the revision. Many commentators on the European situation say that the responsibility for restoring international security lies with Britain and France. The Christian Science Monitor said that today's United States in relation to Europe can be compared to Britain's position in relation to the European continent before 1914. Learning from the past, the US government should express its position as soon as possible. While public opinion is extremely hostile to dictatorships, there are widely divergent views on what role the United States should actually play. Broadly speaking, the current policy of the US government is to wait for Britain and other countries threatened by aggression to form a united front, while working to implement revisions to the current Neutrality Act. Only when the international situation takes a sudden turn for the worse and requires immediate action will the United States change its wait-and-see policy. (Havas, 23rd)

(Washington) - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has decided today to consider the new Neutrality Act amendment proposed by the committee chairman Pittman. (Associated Press, 23rd)

(Washington) - Regarding the Air Force expansion plan, the amendment recently passed by the Senate, which proposes spending $358,000,000 to build 3,532 military aircraft, bringing the total to 6,000, differs from the House of Representatives-passed bill, which also aims to increase the total to 6,000 aircraft (the original House bill proposed spending $300,000,000 to build 3,032 aircraft). Therefore, a joint conference will be held to discuss the matter and decide to use the Senate amendment as the basis. The two houses will then vote on it separately. Once the President signs it, it will become law. In addition, the Senate unanimously approved an additional appropriation of $116,539,287 to purchase urgently needed military equipment and strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal. (Havas, 22nd)

(New York) - Assistant Secretary of State Sayre gave a radio address to the nation tonight, stating, "The events that have taken place in Europe in the past week have proven that the situation the United States must deal with is whether democracy and civilization can continue to exist in the face of this totalitarian tide. Examining the beliefs of the German authorities, it seems they believe that promoting economic nationalism is enough to improve the living standards of their people, which is a fallacy." In short, if all-powerful nations follow their lead, and all notions of faith and moral principles, as well as international treaties, are no longer respected, which democratic nation can feel secure? Sooner or later, they will have to resort to force to resist aggression and curb brutality. (Havas, 22nd)

### Letter of Correction

To the Editor,

Upon recently reading in your newspaper that the German ships "Bremen" and "Europa," which sail the Atlantic route (Germany to the United States route), would be affected by the American boycott movement and suspended, we were deeply alarmed. Our company telegraphed for details and received a reply from our head office stating that the news reported was based on inaccurate rumors. Our company's two ships are still sailing according to the original schedule. We are writing specifically to request that you correct this.

Respectfully,

### Poland in a Difficult Situation; Joint Declaration Difficult to Issue for the Time Being

France's Written Reply to Us States Unreserved Participation Without Reservations

Soviet Attitude Also Ambiguous

(London) - French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax for an hour and a half in the House of Commons this afternoon. Cadogan, a senior official from the British Foreign Office, Strang, the head of the Central European Division, Corbin, the French Ambassador, and Bréart de Boisanger, Bonnet's private secretary, were all present. According to responsible sources here, Foreign Minister Bonnet presented Prime Minister Chamberlain with a written answer regarding the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe, stating that France accepted the British draft joint declaration without reservations. Thus, in addition to maintaining mutual military assistance obligations, Britain and France will also have an obligation to automatically assist the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland if they are attacked in Western Europe. In addition, the British and French governments have also provided Romania with concrete assurances that they will not stand idly by if the country is attacked. In the future, if a joint declaration can be issued with the Soviet Union and Poland, there will be a larger scope of restrictions in Eastern Europe. It is generally understood that although Poland has rejected the British proposal, British Ambassador Sir Kennard will still contact the Polish government tomorrow to persuade them to change their initial decision. It is particularly feared that Poland is unwilling to accept concrete restrictions on Romania, and is also hesitant to accept any restrictions in political or military terms due to the Soviet Union. Regarding this matter, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck may make a decision after coming to London next month to hold talks with the British authorities, but this is not certain. As for the Soviet proposal to convene an international conference, Britain and France originally opposed it, but it is reported that they now intend to accept it. (Havas, 22nd)

(London) - Regarding the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe, after the British government proposed a draft joint declaration to France, Poland, and the Soviet Union, the Polish government refused to participate, while France expressed its approval without reservations. Soviet sources here claim that although the Soviet government has not yet submitted a formal answer, it is expected that it will be happy to join, and may request the adoption of more resolute language and stipulate more concrete restrictions for participating countries, but it is not certain. However, even if the Soviet Union makes this request, it will not make it a precondition. The British draft, it is understood, is extremely simple, stating that peace-loving countries must unite and immediately consult each other in the event of an emergency that endangers peace in Europe in order to "decide on steps to resist aggression." (Havas, 22nd)

(London) - As for the British proposal for a joint declaration by Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, stating that they intend to deal with any future arbitrary actions by Germany in a united manner, the Soviet or Polish governments have not yet responded. It is claimed here that this declaration was only finalized on Monday, so the replies from the governments concerned, along with amendments, are unlikely to arrive in full within a few days. London is fully aware that Poland's position is different from other countries, so it expects the Polish government to raise objections. If a little delay allows the countries concerned time to agree on practical details, it may make this initial plan more concrete. (Reuter, 23rd)

(London) - Observers here generally believe that Poland's situation is difficult, and the sense of insecurity surrounding it has increased with the fate of Memel. If it now participates in a declaration unfavorable to Germany, it will certainly cause unpleasant consequences. It is believed that Germany respects Poland's position in Danzig and Pomerania solely because Poland does not closely participate in policies hostile to Germany. (Reuter, 22nd)

Warsaw - British Ambassador Sir Kennard visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck today. It seems that they discussed the British-proposed plan to issue a declaration against aggression. (Reuter, 22nd)

Warsaw - An official statement declares that Poland recognizes that the Baltic Sea region is related to Poland's direct interests. Sources here interpret this as a hint from Poland to Germany, namely that Poland will consider Germany's expansion of influence in Lithuania beyond Memel to be in conflict with Poland's interests. (Reuter, 23rd)

(London) - Regarding the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe, there are now two options: (1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration first, and then invite other related countries to join; (2) Convene an international conference in London or Paris in the short term. Regarding this, the British government will make a decision tomorrow. Since Poland has refused to join, the Soviet government has delayed submitting a formal answer, and the Balkan countries seem unwilling to openly express their position unless Britain accepts more concrete restrictions, the British government has no choice but to reconsider the idea of convening an international conference. However, if the Soviet government can submit an answer tomorrow, unconditionally endorsing the original British plan, then the British government will still advocate that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration first, and then invite other countries to join through diplomatic channels. (Havas, 22nd)

(London) - Financial circles here recently stated that after Germany annexed the Bohemian and Moravian provinces of Czechoslovakia, the British government exchanged views with the governments concerned on the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe, so as to unite and resist aggression, and also decided to wage economic war against Germany, especially in the Balkans. In general, Britain should first make efforts towards Romania and send a commercial delegation to the country to promote the sale of British exports. If necessary, it may subsidize British exporters. In addition, Britain has only maintained its original economic position in Yugoslavia and Greece and has not competed with Germany. In the future, it will often change its strategy and compete with Germany with all its might. It will also do so in South America. Well-informed sources also said that German goods imported into Britain may be subject to additional tariffs, which is not impossible. (Havas, 22nd)

### Chamberlain's Speech Still Leaves Room for Maneuver Regarding Germany

(London) - Prime Minister Chamberlain stated the international situation in the House of Commons today, saying that the government has made it clear that the German government's recent actions have raised the question of whether Germany will, through constant effort, attempt to dominate all of Europe, or even more than that. If Germany does hold this intention, the British government feels it is important to declare that, as the past has shown, such an attempt will inevitably provoke effective resistance from freedom-loving Britain and other countries. He cannot disclose the results of recent developments and consultations with other governments now. He wishes to state that the British government does not want to obstruct Germany's efforts to expand its export trade through reasonable means. The British government also does not want to see the countries of Europe, with their differing ideologies regarding their internal administrative methods, form opposing camps. The only issue we are concerned about is that we cannot allow independent nations to be oppressed or threatened by force, and be forced to give up their independence. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that if anyone seeks to implement such procedures, we will resist them with all the means at our disposal. (Reuter, 23rd)

### British Parliament Welcomes French President

A Historic First in British History

(London) - Members of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons welcomed French President Lebrun at 11:00 AM today. The British Parliament's welcoming of a foreign head of state is a historic first in British history. President Lebrun's visit is most important for this reason. When President Lebrun and his wife arrived at the Parliament, the crowd was overwhelming. The Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Hailsham, the Speaker of the House of Commons, FitzRoy, and all members of Parliament were at the entrance to greet them. The band played the national anthems of France and Britain. Lord Hailsham then delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the House of Lords, saying, "The British Parliament is closely linked to British history. It is most fitting to welcome Your Excellency the President here. Your Excellency's visit to our country shows that our two countries are closely related. Our House is deeply honored." Speaker FitzRoy then delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the House of Commons, saying, "Many naval officers from your country visited our House in 1905 when the Entente Cordiale was established between Britain and France. Now, in this time of great events, Your Excellency is visiting our country as the head of the French Republic, that is, as the head of Britain's friendly nation and ally. All members of our House are deeply honored, and we sincerely welcome Your Excellency, just as Your Excellency sincerely invited our country. I am deeply aware that our two countries are prepared to work together to safeguard justice, freedom, and progress." Finally, President Lebrun delivered a reply, first expressing his gratitude to the Speakers of both Houses and all members of Parliament, saying, "The good relations between our two countries are due to the same ideas and common interests. Our two countries have worked together through both periods of peace and turmoil, and as a result, our relations have become increasingly advanced and have formed the traditional policy of our two countries. I am very pleased to be able to take this opportunity to solemnly reaffirm this." At that point, President Lebrun and his entourage slowly toured both Houses, had some light refreshments, and then left amidst cheers. (Havas, 23rd)

(London) - French President Lebrun and his wife have been very busy with social engagements in recent days. Shops along the route they have taken have been flying the French flag to show their welcome. Even the poor have hung paper French flags in their windows. The enthusiasm of the public's welcome is evident. President Lebrun and his wife attended a reception hosted by the London County Council this afternoon. In the evening, the French Embassy hosted a banquet in honor of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, with guests including Queen Mary, Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Kent, Prime Minister Chamberlain, and more than 100 others. The seats were arranged in a horseshoe shape. King George VI wore the uniform of the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force, and Queen Elizabeth wore a white dress with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor on her chest. They sat on either side of President Lebrun, while the President's wife sat to George VI's right. During the meal, the orchestra played various famous pieces to entertain the guests. Although no speeches were made, the atmosphere was very harmonious. (Havas, 22nd)

### Brewing Negotiations Between France and Italy

Speculation Surrounds Mussolini's Speech

Opening of the Italian Corporation Council

(London) There is much speculation in London that Mussolini will make colonial demands in his speech next Sunday. Some believe that now is not the time to make such demands. However, a Reuters reporter learned from well-informed sources that Mussolini will definitely declare Italy's demands, and will express them in resolute language. However, it is generally believed that Mussolini is a man of realism and will not make demands to France similar to the Austrian ultimatum, or make his demands in a way that would preclude the possibility of mutual consultation and resolution. It is rumored that certain French quarters are now eager to discuss matters with Mussolini. There have been many rumors about people acting as intermediaries between the two governments, which proves that the two governments are planning to engage in negotiations. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Paris) Legal Adviser to the French Embassy in Italy, Mr. Lagatel, is an old friend of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. After returning to Beijing from Rome yesterday, it is widely rumored that he brought back proposals from the Italian government. Italy is willing to conduct negotiations with France to adjust relations between the two sides. Well-informed sources here have said that Lagatel did not bring back any proposals, and the rumors are not accurate. Although Lagatel is not a diplomat, former French Ambassador to Italy, Juvénal, represented France in the Four-Power Pact negotiations in 1933, and former Ambassador to Italy, Saint-Quentin, also contributed to the negotiations between France and Italy in 1935. (Havas, 22nd)

(Rome) The opening ceremony of the Fascist Corporation Council (the legislative body that replaces the Chamber of Deputies) is scheduled to be held tomorrow. King Vittorio Emanuele III will preside over the ceremony in person and read out a decree. The 682 members will also take an oath together. (Havas, 22nd)

(Rome) The Fascist Corporation Council held its opening ceremony this morning. King Vittorio Emanuele III presided over the ceremony in person and read out a decree, first describing Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and the establishment of the Italian Empire. He then said, "The former League of Nations imposed sanctions on our country, and our country had no choice but to completely change its foreign policy. (Since October 1936, our government has established the closest cooperation with Germany in politics and economics. The Rome-Berlin Axis was announced at that time. This axis is vital to the survival of the two countries. With the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the cooperation between Germany and Italy has been extended to Japan, Hungary, and "Manchukuo"). As for our country's relations with other countries, our country signed an agreement with the United Kingdom on April 16 last year, thereby establishing a good foundation for lasting friendship. We also maintain friendly relations with Albania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Switzerland. (As for France, our government notified the country on December 17 last year to declare the abolition of the 1935 Franco-Italian Agreement and explained the various pending issues that temporarily separate the two sides). As for Spain, our volunteers fighting in that country are extremely brave and have made great contributions. From now on, we must cooperate with each other to the greatest possible extent. (In short, although our country does not believe that peace can last forever, it still hopes to maintain it as much as possible). One point must be stated: the pace of our country's military expansion cannot lag behind others. As for the financial situation of our country, although there have been difficulties in the past, thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, they have been overcome. (We must know that maintaining economic independence is a necessary condition for maintaining political independence. Therefore, our country must strive to get rid of foreign constraints in the economy)." Finally, the King concluded by saying, "I have great faith in the fate of our country and am willing to encourage it with the people." (Havas, 23rd)

(Rome) Political figures here are very interested in the decree read by King Vittorio Emanuele III at the Fascist Corporation Council today. They all say that the King did not specifically mention the differences between France and Italy, probably wanting to resolve the various pending issues through diplomatic channels. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to deliver a speech on the 26th of this month. People generally believe that the Prime Minister will use moderate language because he does not want to create complications in the international community. (Havas, 23rd)

(Paris) The decree read by King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy at the Fascist Corporation Council today has been commented on by well-informed sources here. The so-called notification of December 17 last year, which King Vittorio Emanuele III mentioned, is the notification declaring the abolition of the 1935 Franco-Italian Agreement. Foreign Minister Bonnet replied to it in a speech in the Chamber of Deputies on January 26 this year, and refuted the legal arguments adopted by Italy. According to the Italian government, the implementation of the 1935 Franco-Italian Agreement was conditional on the conclusion of a supplementary agreement between the two countries on the legal status of Italian residents in Tunisia. Since this supplementary agreement was not negotiated and concluded, and the approval procedures were not carried out as usual, the Italian government declared the abolition of the above agreement, which is fully justified in law. In addition, the Italian notification also stated that in order to improve relations between France and Italy, it is necessary to discuss the various pending issues anew. (Havas, 23rd)

Bucharest, Romania The economic negotiations between Romania and Germany have been completed, and a supplementary trade agreement will be signed this afternoon. Foreign Minister Gafencu will issue a statement to the press afterwards to explain the content of the agreement. It is heard that this agreement does not contain any special measures, and Romania will still have full freedom in politics and economics in the future. (Havas, 23rd)

### Economic Negotiations Between Germany and Romania - Once Interrupted, Suddenly Completed

Romania's Freedom Unaffected

France and Romania to Conduct Negotiations

Bucharest, Romania The economic negotiations between Romania and Germany once reached a deadlock yesterday. Walter, a member of the German Ministry of Economic Affairs, was even said to be returning to his country. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held talks with German Minister Fabricius and Walter himself this afternoon for a long time. Economic experts from both sides also held meetings afterwards, which did not end until late at night. The situation was reportedly smooth, and a supplementary trade agreement is expected to be signed soon. Germany will also pressure Hungary to withdraw its military measures on the Romanian border. Regarding this, well-informed sources in Romania said that the Hungarian army has almost been fully mobilized. Romania has only increased the number of protection troops on the border. The Hungarian army must withdraw from the border before Romania can do the same. (Havas, 22nd)

(Berlin) Regarding the economic negotiations between Germany and Romania, the German Ministry of Economic Affairs sent senior official Walter to the Romanian capital to preside over the matter. It is learned that disputes have occurred several times regarding the sale of Romanian oil to Germany. Germany demanded that Romania sell 50% of its annual oil production to Germany. Romania, however, felt that such a large amount of oil was almost equal to the total amount of Romanian exports to Germany and considered it inconvenient to do so. After several compromises, the two sides reached a compromise plan the day before yesterday and scheduled to sign a supplementary trade agreement this afternoon. (Havas, 23rd)

(Berlin) German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk gave a speech to members of the National Socialist Party in the town of Sensofen yesterday. He mentioned that some foreigners, due to recent events in Central Europe, have once again launched propaganda to put economic pressure on Germany. He strongly stated that no matter what the foreign views are, the political and economic power of a large country with 90 million people in Central Europe cannot be completely ignored by them and will inevitably have serious repercussions. The political aspect of Greater Germany has already achieved great success, and the economic aspect should also move forward in the same way. (Haitong, 23rd)

(Paris) Well-informed sources recently announced that France and Romania will continue to conduct commercial negotiations here in the short term. Several Romanian experts will come here in the next few days to prepare everything. (Havas, 22nd)

Hungary The commercial treaty between Hungary and Romania will expire at the end of this month. Representatives from both sides recently initialed an agreement here to extend the effective period of the current treaty until June 30 this year, and will conduct formal negotiations in June to sign a new commercial treaty. (Havas, 22nd)

### A Week of War Situation

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission spoke about the war situation this week (March 16 to 22), saying that there were no large-scale battles on the northern and southern fronts this week. The Japanese army seems to be exhausted and is engaged in replenishment and adjustment, attempting to invade again in order to struggle for their dying lives. However, under the circumstances that our entire army is taking advantage of the gaps and consuming the enemy, the enemy has suffered extremely heavy damage, which is worth reporting. In terms of the overall war situation, it is as follows:

Guangdong Front In recent times, the Japanese army has been frequently mobilized, which is purely a bluff. On the one hand, they are stepping up the construction of defensive works on the Yuehan, Zengcheng, and Conghua lines. They are rushing to repair gun emplacements in Haikou and Xiuying on Hainan Island, and are opening up aircraft warehouses and airports in Wenchang and Ding'an as bases for the air force, showing a look of being trapped and occupying for a long time. As for sporadic battles, our and the enemy's armies have successively engaged in fierce battles in Shunde, Daliang, Shengang, Ding'an, Wenchang, Qiongshan and other places. In the Battle of Qiongshan, the Japanese Colonel Motoda was killed in battle. Enemy planes also flew repeatedly to Daqiu, Lidong, Yingde, and other places to carry out indiscriminate bombing and blind bombing. Our losses were very small. At present, the enemy forces on all fronts are under our absolute control.

Northern Jiangxi Front The enemy army that invaded Lushan has been severely damaged by our army and has been quiet for many days. On the morning of the day before yesterday, a part of the enemy soldiers, under the cover of six airplanes, moved again toward the Good Man Slope, attempting to invade Guling. They were fiercely resisted by our defending troops, and more than 100 enemies were killed. Our artillery fired accurately and damaged two enemy planes. The enemy was defeated in embarrassment. The battle in Duchang is still very fierce. After our counterattack and recovery of the county seat, we continued to capture Dashishan on the 16th, and defeated the enemy who landed from the south of the city. The enemy's momentum was greatly frustrated. Another enemy force of 400 to 500 landed at Yejialiu on the opposite shore of the lake in Wucheng Town, southeast of Dean, attempting to spy on Wucheng in order to echo each other. They were subjected to our fierce artillery fire, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. The enemy on the north bank of Xiushui fired more than a dozen shells at our Guanyinge and Gouziling from the afternoon of the 17th, most of which were tear gas shells. At night, more than 400 to 500 infantrymen crossed the river in the direction of Duma Village, Guanyinge, and Chen Village near the foot of the mountain, with a tendency to invade Tujiapu. After our valiant resistance, the battle was extremely fierce, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. They are still fighting.

Shanxi Front More than 1,000 enemies entrenched in Fushan, Jinxi, have suffered heavy casualties due to our continuous attacks in recent days. Some of them have fled west. More than 500 enemies remained in the city. On the afternoon of the 17th, our army launched a multi-pronged siege, and after several hours of fierce fighting, more than 300 enemies were killed. The remnants of the enemy could not hold out and fled to Linfen. At 7 p.m. that night, the county town was recovered. In An邑, Huoxian, Linjin, and other places in southern Jinxi, our and the enemy had repeated fierce battles. At noon on the 19th, during the siege of Linjin, Su Chaoqun's 1,000-man unit of the puppet imperial collaboration army, fully equipped with weapons, took the opportunity to revolt when our army approached the enemy's阵地. The enemy was attacked from the front and rear, killing and wounding more than 400 people, and has collapsed. Since the 11th, Shangxian has been recovered by our army. On the 19th, the enemy launched a counterattack. The artillery fire was extremely fierce. Our army fought desperately with the enemy all day long. The front lines of both sides went in and out several times. At the same time, another part of our army took advantage of the enemy's dispersed force and raided Jingle, annihilating more than 300 enemies in the northern area of the city. Jingle is still under our siege.

Henan Front The enemy army entrenched in Anyang and Shuizhi Town, attached to several cannons, led by Captain Yamamoto on the afternoon of the 19th, invaded us. They were resisted by our garrison and local teams. After three hours of fierce fighting, more than 200 enemies were killed, and Yamamoto was also killed at the same time. The remnants of the enemy could not hold out and fled in panic, and have now approached Shuizhi. On the 16th and 17th, the enemy army in Wenxian repeatedly bombarded Nanhedu, Fanshuigou, Fanshuicun, and the railway station in Gongxian. Our army fired back and suppressed the enemy. Another elite force of our army also attacked the enemy's rear on the north bank of the river. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and the remnants fled in panic in the direction of Wushe and Qinyang. On the afternoon of the 19th, a part of the enemy invaded Laidongzhai in Zhongmu Northwest. After five hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to hold out and fled. Our army took advantage of the victory and chased them to Liqiao, annihilating more than 100 defending enemies and recovering the area. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy dispatched a large number of reinforcements from Kaifeng to launch a fierce counterattack and released a large amount of poison gas. Because our army's陣地 was destroyed, we withdrew from Laidongzhai and fought fiercely with the enemy. In the evening, the enemy came like a tide. Because of the disparity in numbers, we temporarily withdrew from the寨. We are now actively deploying new front lines and reinforcements to counterattack.

Central Hubei Front Since the fall of Zhongxiang, the enemy army has been actively building the Hanyi, Jingzhong, and other roads, and is rushing to dye Yangzi "ten kilometers north of Zhongxiang" in order to engage in defense. Therefore, the war situation in this area has been quiet for the past week. However, the enemy army in Duoshi Bay has been constantly bombarding the opposite bank for days. Our army fired back and hit the enemy's powder magazine, causing heavy losses to the enemy. Another enemy at the Siduan Port crossing in Duoshi Bay tried to land on the west bank of the Xiang River in Zhangjia, Hongmiao, Wangjia, and other places on the 16th, 17th, and 18th. Our army severely attacked and killed a large number of enemies, and ultimately failed to succeed. At present, there are no enemy traces in these areas. Our and the enemy's armies are still engaged in artillery battles across the river, forming a stalemate. The enemy's attempt to solidify the eastern bank of the Xiang River will be difficult to achieve under the circumstances that our army is attacking from all sides.

Other Fronts Our army in Anhui Province has been attacking the enemy in Xiangshan for days. Our and the enemy's artillery fire is fierce, and the enemy's陣地 has been completely destroyed. An estimated 300 enemies have been killed. Another part of our army recovered Wangjiang County on the 16th, annihilating countless enemies. West of Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province, our army engaged in a fierce battle with more than 1,000 enemies at Huangkou Railway Station on the 19th, killing more than 200 enemies. The enemy fled in embarrassment to the Zhengjiazhuang area of Shanghui Town in Zhenjiang. More than 2,500 enemies surrounded us in eight directions. The defending soldiers resisted in separate directions, killing many enemies. The enemy was severely wounded and retreated. Through these several battles, the enemy's so-called sweeping plan has been completely shattered, and our army's strategy of turning the enemy's rear into the front seems to be successful in the not-too-distant future.

### Dismissal and Prosecution of Sanshui County Magistrate

Shaoguan Chen Zhuolin, the magistrate of Sanshui County, privately transported goods for enemies and engaged in gambling. After the provincial government found out the facts, he was ordered to be dismissed, detained, and sent to the province for prosecution. (Telegram on the 23rd)

### The Philippine Authorities Treat Overseas Chinese Harshly

Conducting Full-Body Examinations on Those Entering the Country

Arbitrarily Taking Items Brought by Travelers

Philippine Correspondence, The Philippine Islands are made up of many islands in the Pacific Ocean. They originally belonged to the United States and were the United States' naval and air force base in the Far East. Since the United States Congress passed the Philippine Independence Act, the Philippines is nominally one of the independent countries in the world. Most of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines are engaged in business and labor. The number is considerable, mostly from Fujian Province in our country. Therefore, the Minnan language is almost comparable to the Filipino language in the Philippines and is widely spoken. After the United States promulgated the Immigration Law, the Philippines also had a ban on restricting Chinese workers. However, people who come to the Philippines for travel and short stays are not treated very badly. After the independence of the Philippine Islands, the Filipinos' treatment of the Chinese is very different. Here are a few notes on the treatment and feelings that the reporter has recently experienced in the Philippines, so that readers can know one aspect of the suffering of overseas Chinese abroad.

Very Strict Inspection

When entering the port of the Philippines, the Customs and Health Bureau sends people to board the ship to examine the body, the smallpox vaccination on both arms, the certificate of preventive injection, the trachoma of both eyes, and even all parts of the body. If any signs of disease are found, they will be imprisoned in the so-called "water house" water prison and expelled from the country by boat. After the examination of various parts of the body surface is approved, the stool must also be checked. If it is impossible to defecate temporarily, the examiners use a rubber tube to irrigate medicine and force the removal of feces. Passengers of the third and fourth classes must still be imprisoned on the ship for 24 hours after being approved by the Health Bureau before they can land.

Forced Fingerprinting

After landing, luggage cannot be carried with you and must be taken by customs for inspection, and you must immediately report to the Immigration Bureau. First, the export certificate (the certificate requested when returning home) is exchanged for a residence permit. The exchange procedure is extremely troublesome. First, you must take photos of the front and side faces and send them to the Immigration Bureau in person. The bureau will then, according to the new law, require the certificate holder to print fingerprints of all ten fingers on more than 30 pieces of various papers in person. If the bureau has not yet studied your procedures clearly, you will have to wait quietly for two or three weeks before you can receive your residence permit. However, the method of fingerprinting is specifically for Chinese people. I remember asking them in English at the time. Although the procedures are slightly easier for those who understand English, the method of abuse is still the same.

Various Demands

After the residence permit is issued, you can pick up your luggage from the customs. Regardless of size, it must be thoroughly inspected by customs officers. The purpose of the inspection is to check for tax evasion and contraband, but in fact, it is to check and find out whether there are any items in the luggage that can be taken for themselves. Fortunately, their desires are not high. No matter the size of the item or the fineness of the product, they take it for themselves whenever they have the opportunity. If one person is not enough, two or three people come to reach out for it without any scruples. The Jiangxi porcelain Buddha statues and other items that the reporter bought to send to relatives and friends were certainly taken away by them, and even the biscuits and fruits that were prepared for personal use were all taken away by people up and down. If the luggage is not plentiful and cannot satisfy their desires, at least they must get a cigarette, otherwise, they will make things difficult in every possible way, making people miserable.

### The Japanese Army's Southern Invasion Has Shown a Trend of Decline - The Chinese Army Prepares for a General Counter-offensive

Wu, Yu, Wei, and Deng Appointed as Commanders-in-Chief

Hong Kong Correspondence, After China's resistance to Japan turned to the second phase, there have been no major changes in the war zones in various regions for five months. However, the replenishment and training of troops in various war zones, the coordination and adjustment of personnel, and the expanded activities of political work are more active than before. As for the secret strengthening of the new air force, the precise organization of mechanized units, and the planning and improvement of transportation, there have been considerable achievements, which are enough to consolidate the front line of long-term resistance. However, the current overall strategy is to take the defense in the military and the offense in politics. This is what the supreme leader calls the importance of politics over military affairs and the importance of the rear over the front. The Southwest Military Conference held in Guilin the other day also followed this principle and has decided on various plans, and will descend on the east, south, west, and north lines.

Everyone Adjusts

Prepare to a certain extent, and then launch a full-scale general counter-offensive. Regarding the Huizhou-Chaozhou-Meizhou area on the eastern front, Commander-in-Chief Wu Qiwu is appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forward. Yu Hanmou, commander-in-chief of the northern section of the Guangdong Road on the northern front, is appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forward. Wei Yunsong, commander of the southern line of Gaozhou-Leizhou-Qinzhou-Lianzhou, is appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forward, while Commander-in-Chief Xia Wei is also in charge of planning the southwest lines. The southwest lines are the roads that the Japanese army must pass through to spy on Guangxi. Therefore, after the Guilin Conference, special attention was paid to all the elite troops that had completed training in Guangxi Province.

Elite Troops

Have been sent to the east as much as possible and deployed in the forefront of the first line of the southwest routes. Its second to third lines are also layered with well-arranged troops. Recently, the Central Government has also added the Fifth Mechanized Division to Guiliu, which shows that the national defense on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi is actually extremely sufficient. A senior military officer once said to people that before three or four months ago, after the abandonment of Guangzhou, if the Japanese army quickly advanced to the upper reaches of the West River, the western line might be shortened to a certain point. Now it is not the case, because the strength of the troops on each front line is stronger than before.

Strengthened Tenfold

And the four words "strengthen the walls and clear the fields" have also been implemented, and will not retreat a single step. Even if the Japanese army launches a full-scale invasion, taking another step deeper will be even more dangerous. We also look back at the Japanese army. In the past four or five months, the forward outposts have been stationed in the Gan崗, Mumian, and Jiaowei areas in the upper reaches of Sanshui, facing the Chinese army across the river, only more than 1,000 meters apart. Although they have repeatedly increased their troops, advancing and retreating, they have not dared to cross the river to advance half a step. The eastern line stops at Shilong, Boluo, Sucun, and Zhengguo, and the northern line stops at Huaxian, Xinjie, and Conghua Shangang. The outer defense line of Guangzhou seems to be smaller than two months ago, which shows that its troops are not enough to be allocated.

Southern Route

Since the occupation of Nanhai Island, its fleet has appeared from time to time on the coast of the Leizhou Peninsula and the northern ocean surface, and its purpose is nothing more than to pretend to seal off our coastline. Therefore, it is judged that the Japanese army still has no ability to penetrate into Guangxi. The southwestern war is in a stalemate. A diplomat once said that the Japanese side's strategy towards China has not changed the conspiracy to induce the Chinese side to submit and seek peace, but to arm the entire island of Hainan with all their energy, coupled with diplomatic means,

Threaten England and France

In order to eliminate the power of England and France to support China's resistance to Japan and promote the conspiracy to seek peace, the military in South China is temporarily adopting a defensive posture, unwilling to drive deep and make major consumption and sacrifices. Based on this strategy, the Japanese side only intends to protect its strongholds in the occupied areas of South China, support puppet organizations, and plunder the wealthy materials of South China for their own supply in order to maintain the situation of lingering on. The stagnation of the war lines in various routes in Guangdong is also due to this.

### Liang Han-ts'ao on China's Tactical Progress

Japan, on the Other Hand, Is Increasingly Declining

Guilin Correspondence: Director Liang Han-ts'ao of the Political Department of the Southwest Headquarters, since arriving in Guilin on the 6th, has been busy attending reorganization and political work conferences. Recently, the conferences have concluded, and last night, this reporter had the opportunity to meet Director Liang. Director Liang, in his forties, appears very energetic and robust. This reporter asked him about his impressions of the reorganization and political work conference. Director Liang replied that the conference was very fruitful. The atmosphere was filled with unity and harmony. There was accurate criticism and detailed discussion of past work and future work plans. Regarding the political implementation of the second phase of the resistance, Director Liang expressed insightful opinions and expressed great optimism about the war of resistance. He said that Japan's war is one of decline, while China's war is one of progress. This is evident in all aspects. The consumption of Japanese military expenses and manpower has exceeded his budget infinitely, and the domestic economy has reached the brink of collapse. Japanese soldiers have lost faith in the stability of their own country's economy, which shows the general state of the domestic economy. Internationally speaking, democratic countries such as Britain and the United States are giving us loans, and the Soviet Union is also giving us practical help, as well as the sympathy and assistance of the world to our country, all of which are enough to make Japan's international status increasingly isolated. Speaking of the future political work in the Southwest, Director Liang already has a complete plan for this. He is now preparing to train a large number of unemployed and out-of-school youths to go to the army to intensify the political work of the army, while isolating soldiers from combat, and expanding the army. In short, the war of resistance has entered the second stage, and China's new strength is growing, while Japan's clay feet have fallen into an irrecoverable abyss.

### International Cup and Scorto Cup Two Champions to Play Charity Match

The Most Difficult Thing Is Negotiating the Venue

Will Be the Most Exciting Performance of the Season

Recently, the Portuguese football team, which won the International Cup, initiated a charity match between this year's International Cup champion Portuguese team and the Scorto Cup champion Lido team for the sake of more charitable provincial gatherings, with the proceeds used for charity. After that, it will follow the "Macklin Engineering Cup" and hold a regular match between the two national cup champions every year. It is reported that if the Shanghai English-language Damei Evening News can mature this matter, it is willing to donate a huge silver shield as a souvenir for the winning team, which they will keep for one year. Currently, Mr. Sossos, the manager of the Portuguese team, has expressed his intention to Lido, and both parties have agreed. The venue is intended to be the Yiyuan Garden, but the venue is now closed, and efforts are being made to find a solution. However, it is not known whether it will be possible. As for the date of the match, it will be held in the shortest possible time as soon as the venue is determined. According to both sides' strength, they are strong and can be called the second most difficult in the Chinese and Western football teams. If this matter can be completed, it will not only help the refugees and football fans, but also add a different color to the football world.

### Western Union Football Cup Matches End Lido Wins Junior Cup

Yesterday, a 5-1 Thrashing of the Survey Team

The final of the Western Union Junior Cup football match, Lido vs. British Army Survey Team, was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. No less than 3,000 spectators watched the match, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Lido's victory over the Survey Team after winning the Scorto Cup was expected. Therefore, Zheng Tongyu and Yun Feng were sent to the battle. Zheng's performance was good, while Yun was relatively weak. The Survey Team knew that they would be defeated, so they were determined to fight to the death. Sure enough, they scored a goal first, but it was only a flash in the pan. In the first half, the Survey Team was behind 1-2. In the second half, Lido controlled the overall situation and scored three more goals. As a result, Lido defeated the Survey Team 5-1 and won the championship. After the match, Mr. Hu Xiansheng, a member of the league's appeals committee, supported the award, and Lido team captain Li Yichen received it. The Junior Cup, which was held by Bei Xitong in the previous year, returned to the hands of the Chinese team, and all the cup matches in this year also came to an end. The lineups of both sides in yesterday's match are as follows:

Lido

Zheng Tongyu, Li Yichen, Zhang Lingen, Yun Feng, Tan Fuzhen, Meng Yiliang, Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Wang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Mingsheng

Survey Team

Evans, Brown, Haemilin, Dixon, Simpson, Chetmanns, Ferguson, Wea, Cliveley, Fermisth, Harwest

Survey Team Opens the Record

Lido played against the wind first and failed to penetrate deeply. Zhang Mingsheng entered from the right and hooked Xu Wenkui, who shot out of bounds. The Survey Team's Harwest took the opportunity to attack. Li Yichen blocked and slipped. Meng Yiliang touched it into a corner kick. Ha's kick was very good. Zheng Tongyu jumped out and saved it. The iron leg headed it out obliquely. Harwest swept it again and was caught. Cao Qiuting then attacked twice, but failed to score. After 15 minutes, Fermisth high-pitched the ball towards the goal. The ball drifted downwind. Zheng Tongyu's save was unstable and slipped into the net. The Survey Team took the lead by one goal. Before long, Xu Wenkui scored a shot from Sun Jinshun's pass, but it was offside and abandoned. Lido launched another siege and had many good opportunities, but all were missed. At 23 minutes, Zhang Mingsheng passed to Sun Iron Leg, who passed it to the left. Cao Qiuting rushed up and shot quickly, and the ball bounced in from the crossbar, tying the score at 1-1. At this point, Lido's offensive was even stronger, and the Survey Team was difficult to resist. Finally, at 41 minutes, Haemilin committed a foul for pulling someone, and was penalized a 12-yard penalty, which was executed by Sun Jinshun. The iron leg started, and the goal was scored in response. The first half ended, with Lido leading 2-1.

Lido Wins the Championship

After the break, Sun Jinshun and Wang Kehou exchanged positions, which was even more successful. Lido tilted its troops to attack, and the ball often hovered in the Survey Team's hinterland. Iron Leg got Xu Wenkui's help to shoot, but was blocked by Evans into a corner kick. Zhang Mingsheng's opening was ineffective. Cao Qiuting crossed from the left, Wang Kehou jumped up and missed. Iron Leg was about to shoot, but Simpson had returned to save it, and it became a corner kick. Cao Qiuting's opening was blocked again. After 12 minutes, Sun Iron Leg scored a low sweep from Qiuting's hook at the 12-yard mark. Then, Xu Wenkui's shot was caught. Iron Leg shot twice, but both bounced back from the enemy general. Seeing the opportunity, Harwist secretly crossed the warehouse. After Li Yichen blocked it, he entered Fermith's feet. Fei Mengkou, Zheng Tongyu fell to the ground with a扑, picked it up and threw it away, which was very dangerous. After 22 minutes, Xu Wenkui scored a goal at the 20-yard mark, making it 4-1. Then Harwist kicked a free kick. Tan Fuzhen missed a foot, Zheng Tongyu扑空, Zhang Lingen补进钩出, but it had passed the white line, the referee did not notice, and Lido was spared. After that, Iron Leg had a wonderful shot, but it hit the post. Finally, half a minute before the end, Xu Wenkui scored another goal at the 25-yard mark. The silver whistle sounded long, and Lido won 5-1.

### Zhang Zhihong Wins Championship in Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Sixth Group

Feng Qingxun's Efforts Failed

In the Jingwu Cup All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Tournament, the elimination round of the sixth group was held yesterday. Because the talents in this group were average, the battle was extremely tense. Cui Chengqiu, the sixth in the previous session, seemed to have become unfamiliar with his ball skills and was unfortunately defeated by Feng Qingxun, the champion of the Qianye Cup individual tournament. In the semi-finals, Feng used his steady counter-draw to defeat Liu Longzhou, a veteran of Siming, and won the right to the finals. Zhang Zhihong, the seeded staff member of this group, entered the first and second rounds with hard battles. Feng was able to cheer up, but in the three games, he could win but did not win, so his efforts failed. Alas. As a result, Zhang finally relied on his experience to win the championship of this group. The results are as follows:

Feng Qingxun won Cui Chengqiu 3-0, Liu Longzhou won Ni Chunbing 3-0.

Feng Qingxun won Liu Longzhou 3-2.

Zhang Zhihong won He Ming 3-1, Li Shanglu won Mao Delin 3-1.

Zhang Zhihong won Li Shanglu 3-0.

Zhang Zhihong won Feng Qingxun 3-1.

### Finance: Northern Gang Turns from Buying to Selling, Spot Prices Suddenly Fall Again

Yesterday, the spot market situation of 烚赤 (shā chì - a type of gold) was suddenly weak again. This was due to the weakening buying interest of the Hong Kong Gang and the Northern Gang turning from buying to selling. The situation on the day was weak first and then strong, and the entire situation was shifted by supply and demand. At first, due to the large amount of selling by the securities gangs and the weak buying force of a certain silver house, it tended to go downstream. The lowest price once fell to 2,068 yuan. However, soon after, gold shops, a certain bank, and a certain broker all took advantage of the low price and rushed to buy, causing the price to rush out of the 2,070 yuan mark. Later, as supply and demand became scarce, the situation gradually stabilized. As a result, the price fell by 9.5 yuan. People were still calm, and transactions were not active, about 600 taels. The price of silver jewelry also fell first and then rebounded, and finally rose by a small 1 yuan. The price of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold did not change.

### 烚赤 Falls by 9.5 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening was due to people's slightly weaker sentiment and the securities gangs' selling intentions were strong, so most of the people at that time were waiting and watching. As a result, the price was shouted down from 2,085-6 yuan to 75 yuan, before it was opened. First, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain silver house, with the opening price of 2,075 yuan, which was 11 yuan lower than the previous day. After the opening, a certain silver house absorbed 50 taels from the securities gang, 73 yuan. Then, the securities gang sold 50 taels to a certain bank, with a price of 70 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to a gold shop, 68 yuan. After this, the securities gangs stopped selling and watched, so it moved upward. A gold shop bought 50 taels from a silver house gang, 75 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange industry suddenly came to sell, selling 50 taels to the same industry, 78 yuan, and then selling 50 taels to a certain bank, with a price of 77 yuan. Later, another money exchange industry followed suit and sold 50 taels to a certain broker, with a price of 76 yuan, and 50 taels to a silver house gang, with a price of 74 yuan. At that time, the money exchange industry also sold 50 taels to the silver house gang, with a price of 72 yuan. It was heard that the US exchange rate was slightly weak, so the price rose again. The money exchange industry bought 50 taels from the silver house gang, with the closing price of 76 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the market situation turned dull, and the price was also stable, and the transaction was very sparse. Only the gold shop absorbed 50 taels from the money exchange industry, 76 yuan, and then bought 50 taels from the money exchange industry, 76.5 yuan. After this, the buyer shouted 78 yuan, but the seller had to supply 79 yuan. The two sides held on until 4 o'clock and did not open, so the closing price in the evening was still 2,076.5 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 9.5 yuan compared to the previous closing. The difference for the day was 10 yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the cash shop was 2,085 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,070 yuan. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.

### Jewelry Gold Down 1 Yuan

The initial selling price of silver jewelry in silver houses did not change. At 10 o'clock, due to the potential weakness of 烚赤, the price was also lowered by a small 2 yuan. Later, at noon, due to the slightly stronger situation of 烚赤, the price also rose by 1 yuan. As a result, Datonghang changed to 211 yuan, Xintonghang was 209 yuan, and the purchase price was 203 yuan.

### British Pure Gold Unchanged

On the 22nd, the price of British pure gold in London did not change, remaining at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pence per ounce, so the China Advanced Purchase Price of the Central Bank also remained at 1,211.6 yuan. The listed customs gold also did not change, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 cents, 9 and 4 mils. The Shanghai standard gold price was also calculated at 1,206.9 yuan.

### 英美金票獨升

Yesterday, unalloyed British gold remained unchanged. The British-American exchange rate fell back to 0.0625. Foreign exchange in this port and settlements by foreign firms were slightly more prosperous. Supply from Hong Kong Electricity and banks was not weak, suggesting latent stability. However, due to the tightness between Britain and America, the British exchange rate was flat while the American exchange rate was slightly weak. During the opening of transactions involving silver bullion, there was a sudden appearance of weakness. Retail investors took advantage of the high prices to sell and lock in profits. Although customer assistance was very smooth, with a temporary rebound, the demand could not match the supply, thus trending downward again. In the afternoon, people were distracted and transactions suddenly became scarce, with no opportunities for speculation, and the trend was sideways. Due to the stability of exchange rates, sentiment regarding silver bullion was distracted and transactions were very few. Only British and American gold notes experienced some demand, trending slightly upward. Other currencies showed no gains or losses. There were no transactions on the exchange. Yesterday’s market prices showed only a five-point increase in British gold notes and a one-point increase in American gold notes. All other currencies remained unchanged.

### 大條續降印銀疲軟

London dispatch on the 22nd: Speculators sold off while Indian traders bought according to the listed prices, stabilizing the market. After the close, market conditions continued to be stable.

Also, Bombay silver dispatch: Indian silver weakened again, with spot prices shrinking by six annas, March delivery falling by five annas, and April delivery dropping by four annas.

### 貼現率無軒輊

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills remained stable between $50.025 per thousand, with the lowest being $50, then returning to $50.025, showing no change from the previous day's price.

### 英匯穩定美匯緊

Yesterday’s exchange market was fairly stable because although foreign firms bought, Hong Kong Electric continued to sell, and foreign banks also supplied actively. The American exchange rate softened slightly due to the slight weakness in the British-American exchange rate and the sellers' reluctance to supply. There was little change on the day, and transactions were also light. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to trend cheaper due to the efforts of money exchangers to sell.

At the start of the morning, London silver bars for spot and forward deliveries were shrinking by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold also showed no change. There were no changes in the exchange rates of British, French, and Shanghai currencies. The US dollar fell by 0.0625 against the British pound, dropped by 0.125 against the French franc, and remained unchanged against the Shanghai currency. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening selling prices were 8.28125 for the British exchange rate and $18.1875 for the American exchange rate, both flat compared to the previous closing. After opening, although foreign firms settled frequently, the Hong Kong Electric continued to sell, and foreign banks supplied heavily, resulting in a lack of changes. Foreign firms settled with Hong Kong Electric, and Mercantile Bank’s British exchange rate was 8.28125. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was further reduced by half a cent, calculated at 4.50%. Afterwards, foreign firms purchased the American exchange rate from Banque Belge pour l'Etranger at $16.1875, followed by Chinese banks trading the American exchange rate at $16.15625, showing a slight softening. Near noon, money exchangers suddenly aggressively sold Hong Kong currency, causing the situation to loosen. Hong Kong currency was sold to foreign firms, rising from $55.375 to half a dollar. At the noon close, the bank's selling prices were 8.28125 for the British exchange rate and $16.15625 for the American exchange rate.

The afternoon market was quite quiet, with very few price changes. Only foreign banks, such as Dutch banks, and foreign firms successively settled with HSBC and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, with the British exchange rate at 8.28125. They also purchased American exchange rates from an unspecified bank at $16.15625. Afterwards, Chinese banks traded Hong Kong currency at $55.50, which was very flat. At the evening close, the bank's selling prices were 8.28125 for the British exchange rate and $16.15625 for the American exchange rate. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British rate was flat, the American rate was tight by 0.03125, and the Hong Kong rate continued to increase by 0.25.

Industrial and Commercial Discussions

### Why is Spring Coal Rising?

— Pei Ben

Fragrant flowers and charming people, spring returns to the earth. In previous years, the coal market, upon reaching springtime, would open with a red banner, transactions would gradually clear, and coal prices would also return to relaxation. Unexpectedly, this year, the times are extraordinary. Since the new year, the transactions of bituminous and anthracite coal have not been particularly prosperous, but the prices have been rising steadily, with no falls, rising by two or three dollars. This situation is not only a mystery to outsiders but also seen as unexpected and unfathomable even among industry insiders.

However, the cause lies in the autumn of last year. The coal firms and factories in this port, considering the inconvenient transportation and obstructed supply of domestic coal mines, realized that although the British Kailan Mining Administration had a large output, the supply was intermittent and unreliable due to a certain special force. They anticipated that the coal supply would be lacking in the coming winter and that foreign coal would be necessary. Therefore, they flocked to foreign countries such as India and Australia to make large purchases. Foreign firms, seeing the potential for profit, established "coal departments" one after another to pre-order on behalf of customers and peddled everywhere. As a result, regardless of outsiders or industry insiders, they believed that there was a way to make money and that rare goods were available, scrambling to be first, fearing to be late. This led to an unprecedented import volume last winter. In a few months, more than 200,000 tons of foreign coal were imported. At the same time, a large amount of Kailan coal also poured in to supply users. As a result, the goods were abundant, sales declined, and promotion was difficult. As the end of the lunar year approached, and the general financial conditions tightened, some had to painfully cut prices to quickly sell out. Therefore, except for those who were quick to act and had lower costs, who were still able to gain small profits, most others suffered losses due to tight exchange rates and soaring water transportation costs. It is said that a certain coal firm in this port lost more than 100,000 dollars due to ordering Australian coal. The magnitude of the swings can be imagined. Consequently, the coal firms, having suffered these blows, learned from the past and felt negative about ordering foreign coal. This is why the arrival of goods has been scarce in recent months.

It was not until the opening of the new year that, although the accumulation of bituminous coal had gradually thinned and the supply was insufficient to meet the demand, sales were not strong, and they maintained a stable trend. Recently, due to the clandestine sales of Kailan coal, the sales office charged an additional four dollars, causing other goods to increase uniformly, presenting an abnormal price increase. As for stove anthracite, the season has passed, but because the source is not wide and the industry also has unreleased storage documents in hand, it is still strong. Once a large number of goods arrive, the price will return to relaxation, which can be predicted.

### Securities: Securities Unable to Lift Their Heads, Same for Far East Stocks, All Because of the Perilous European Situation

Yesterday's off-market securities trading showed signs of being unable to lift its head, due to the high price increases the previous day, resulting in a reversal. The surface appearance seemed quite weak, and the generally poor situation in Zhejiang caused market sentiment to appear confused. Yesterday's process saw prices initially high and then low, and then low and then high in the afternoon, but the overall market price did not rise or fall at all. The buying and selling sides' lines remained as such: Xinfeng Yongshou consistently bought, while Defu Tiansheng Tongde Renchang and other firms also had intake. The selling side saw Dafeng and Tongkang and other firms release long positions, while Weisi No. 4 and No. 20, as well as Lianhe, sold in the morning. Zhongyi No. 1 and No. 5 also sold in the afternoon, so the market price ultimately failed to rise despite repeated attempts to raise it. Although the bulls tried to pull the market up at the close, they were surrounded by bears, so the number of optimists was small. As a result, the market price was exactly the same as the previous day, with absolutely no rise or fall, which is also quite coincidental. The total turnover was estimated at around six or seven hundred thousand dollars. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 5770 5730 5745 No change

Unified B 5180 5145 5150 Ditto

Unified C 5140 5100 5115 Ditto

Unified D 5030 4980 4990 Ditto

Unified E 5040 499 — 5015 Ditto

96 660 — 660 Ditto

### Sugar Market: Few Transactions of Coarse Granulated White Sugar

Yesterday's sugar market tended to be flat and soft, with few transactions. The Exchange's assigned price for coarse granulated white sugar for re-export was $16.575, with only 100 bags changing hands. The current prices for spot and Taikoo sugar were maintained, with no transactions. A little domestic sugar was released, with more than 80 bags of Huizhou white sugar at $23.10, 30-40 bags of ordinary Huanggang Qing sugar at $14.90, and dozens of bags of cotton red sugar at $15.2-3.

Yesterday, 720 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong, and 500 bags came from Shantou.

### Seafood: Wenzhou Dried Shrimp Not Weak, Shantou Golden Hook Has Been Out of Stock for a Long Time

Recently, the outflow of Wenzhou dried shrimp from this street has been not weak, and the Tianjin group has resumed operations, with a firm trend. Yesterday's list price opened at $61.50, up $4 from before.

Shantou golden hook shrimp has been out of stock for a long time. It has been found that the base here is scarce, and the quality is also dry. The current market is advancing, and the price is $92 for five units.

### Medicinal Materials: Supply of Job's Tears Interrupted, All Because of Difficult Transportation

Job's tears (i.e. rice kernels) are produced in Jiangbei. Recently, due to the unrest in the area, transportation is difficult, resulting in the interruption of the supply. The goods in stock have also dwindled. The previous market price was $50 per picul, and today some are calling for $60, with a fairly strong trend.

### Yarn and Cotton: Banks Dump Goods, Double Horse Yarn Plunges by More Than $2, Tianjin Purchases of Coarse Yarn Are Still Smooth

Yesterday's yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, turned to a recovery due to the easing situation in eastern Zhejiang and more stable sentiment. Wenzhou merchants resumed buying of 42-count double-strand yarn, and Shanghai-Ningbo shipping continued to operate normally, but the demand was very shallow. As a result, buyers resumed activity, but the demand from South China was relatively sluggish, and very little was purchased. However, the Tianjin merchants from the north purchased coarse yarn quite smoothly, and sentiment was supported. However, the hoarders' Continental Bank had purchased a large amount of 20-count Double Horse yarn, totaling several thousand bales, at over $400. Due to the poor prison environment, they have already begun to sell at a loss. As a result, the market price was soft. In the afternoon, Changtai represented Continental Bank and again released files, reportedly about 400 bales, with a price of only $386 to $386.5, down $2.00, $1.75 to $2.25 from the previous market.

The current yarn situation: At the opening of the morning market, because Ningbo was still very stable, the Shanghai-Ningbo route was not blocked, and Haikou was bombed without affecting it, sentiment was revived, and the air of nervousness dissipated. The opening price increased by $0.50, and the current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was $387. Several dozen bales were transacted among peers. However, customer demand was inactive. Subsequently, buyers became active, gradually increasing the price. Finally, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was $388.20, and warehouse receipts were also made to $7. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly changed, and Continental Bank suddenly released goods, about several hundred bales, with the selling price falling by $2. However, there were not many customers, and the brokers fought, with a chaotic state, mostly speculative in nature. Only a few dozen bales were transacted at the price of $386, and shortly afterwards it reached $386.5. Apart from this batch of transactions, there was no other business. The industry was static and did not act. It has been found that the total number of purchases from all groups for the day was 1,905 bales. The market was generally similar to the previous day, but 32-count Tiannv yarn fell by $5. The factory released 60 bales of 10-count Double Globe yarn from the Xinyu factory, with a price of $292. Today, 1,110 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Shantou, and 90 pieces were exported to Hong Kong. The quantity purchased by each group is listed on the left:

Peers 1,080 Ningbo 5 Wenzhou 30

Mainland 80 Yunnan 155 Hong Kong 5

(Tianjin) 535 Jiangxi 5

Xiamen 5 Total 1,905

The Japanese yarn market was still plain and unremarkable, with a slightly softened appearance, because actual demand was not strong, but the major players were still in a bullish position. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue yarn was $339 to $340, and the current price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn was $329 to $330, with little change from the previous day.

### Indian Cotton Fails to Arrive in Shanghai on Schedule, American Cotton Transactions Become Active

Firewood Machine Cotton Reaches Peak of $72.20

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market felt quite tired. Washington still has no definite news regarding the disposal of stored cotton. Yesterday, due to the sell-off in Wall Street and the closure of long positions, it fell another six or seven points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than half a rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than twenty points. This morning's telegrams said that the European situation has stabilized, and it is expected that overseas cotton markets may have a consistent rebound today. Yesterday, exchange rates were looser, converted to legal currency, and cotton prices all fell. It is estimated that American and Indian cotton fell by $0.60 per picul, Indian cotton fell by $0.30, and Egyptian cotton fell by $1.20.

The Shanghai market for foreign cotton transactions became quiet again today, due to the failure of yarn prices to improve. Due to the extremely low water transportation costs and the difficulty in transporting goods, the goods previously ordered by various factories could not be transported on schedule. Therefore, there has been little interest in Indian cotton recently. However, the transactions of American cotton have become active, but due to the inability to release the loan cotton immediately, the purchase of cotton cannot be carried out at will, so the transaction volume has not been large. Yesterday, only Hongzhang imported 500 bales of American cotton, and it was stated at the time that this cotton needs to arrive in Shanghai in mid-May. It is not known whether it can be transported to Shanghai at that time. The prices of foreign cotton yesterday are listed below:

Raw Material Category Delivered to Factory Including Tax

60-count Egyptian Cotton Premium $106.65

Also Also Medium $103.65

80-count Also Premium $130.05

Also Also Medium $29.90

20-count American Mitterlin $83.90

Also Also Low Grade $70.85

32-count Also $92.60

Also Also Low Grade $81.75

42-count Also $94.40

Also Also Low Grade $82.65

Also South American Brazilian Cotton Premium $88.20

Also Also Medium $84.90

Also Also Low Grade $75.80

10-count Indian Pingguoer $61.80

16-count Indian Omura $64.40

20-count Also $72.15

24-count Indian Bairoch $79.50

32-count American Xint $84.65

32/42-count American Pengapur $89.10

The domestic cotton business has slightly improved, with more active transactions, but although the number of transactions is high, the volume is weak. It is because the price is too high, and the factories' buying interest is not strong. Buyers really have no choice but to adopt the need to mix in Indian cotton, which is bright in color. Recently, with the decline in foreign cotton prices, Chinese and foreign factories have shifted their focus to Indian and American cotton and are starting to proceed. Yesterday, firewood machine cotton reached a new high of $72.20, up another $0.25. The remaining prices were not much different from the previous day. 2,800 bales of Zhejiang cotton arrived, and only 60 bales of Nantong cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived in Shanghai. The current cotton transaction volume and market list are listed on the left:

Xiasha Cotton $77.50 Sanyi purchased 128 bales Exchange Warehouse Delivery

Firewood Machine Cotton $71.50 Xiehe purchased 140 bales Cash Also

Changyinsha Packaged $78.00 Peers purchased 102 bales Tax-Free Also

American Packaged $85.00 Also 97 pieces Exchange Also

Firewood Machine Cotton $72.25 Also 120 bales Cash Also

Yaoyi $67.00 Xinhe Factory purchased 1,000 bales Exchange Factory Delivery

Second-Grade White Cotton $71.00 Yuda purchased 320 bales Also Warehouse Delivery

Firewood Machine Packaged $77.00 Peers purchased 102 bales Exchange Also

### Grains: Flour Competitively Sold, Wholesale Prices on this Street Also $0.05 Lower

Nanyang Buyer Demand Still Uneven

Wheat Trading Not Easy to Approach

The spot market for flour continues to be sluggish. It was found that the factory intends to reduce the settlement price by $0.05 in order to compete for sales, because the buyer's price has been reduced. Therefore, starting yesterday, the wholesale price on this street was changed to $4.60. As for the price for buyers, it is a special confidential sacrifice in order to promote sales in North China, and it is not the official market price. Even those in the industry cannot know the details. According to factory news yesterday, the flour price has been in a chaotic state these days. It is heard that yesterday's retail sales in this street were nearly 10,000 bags, and the selling price of No. 2 flour was $4.60, while Nanyang still has a price of $4.65. The market price varies, which is evident. Under the dumping of foreign flour, it is really not enough to promote sales without competition. It is said that Jianyuan Company sold 5,000 bags of Citibank flour in transit, priced at $4.32. This batch of goods will be transported in early next week. There are currently few transactions for distant foreign flour. 500 bags of flour were transported to Shantou today.

Wheat trading is also at a standstill, but in recent days, there have been sporadic small shipments, such as dozens to two or three hundred bags transported from Suku and Jiangbei. Those holding the goods are holding on to prices of seven dollars and three to four cents because the production price is high, while the factory's purchase price is about six dollars and eight cents, resulting in both sides not being able to approach each other easily, and the market is as silent as ever.

### Japonica Rice Market Slightly More Active, Foreign Clients All Low Balling

The source of Durham rice, the total arrival at the river is the 7th, and the car transports 3,000 to 4,000 bags of the cargo, The morning market sentiment is still relaxed, and few stores on this street have gone in, and the market continues to be sluggish. The price of thick and thin japonica has decreased by one or two cents. In the late market, the hoarders are slightly active, gradually becoming active, and then presenting a stable image. The price of Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian also depreciated a few cents, and the price change was due to the entry of foreign glutinous rice into the market. People's hearts are fluctuating, and they all hold a little bit of entry, and the market also fell by about 2 cents. However, it is said that only 300 bags of foreign glutinous rice have arrived. It is probably caused by emotional agitation. Yin Yuan belongs to a small amount of goods, so it can be fixed.

As for the Kexian, the current stock continues to be sold, and the opening price in the morning has been lowered by 2 cents. Then, new stocks and scattered households on this street took the opportunity to buy in small amounts, and the market began to turn from fatigue to stability, but the market is ultimately more than a small corner. The top Xian of Nanjing opened at 13 yuan, the appetite is still relaxed, and the total number of Nanjing Wuxian transactions in the big market has also been reduced to 2,400 to 500 bags.

Sai Kung No. 1 foreign rice is still only traded in small quantities. However, the price of $17 and some cents has been affected by the gradual decline of local buyers. Yesterday's asking price for the goods was 17 yuan and 1 cent, and the purchasers only returned 17 yuan.

### Oil Cake: Raw Soybean Oil Shows Little Sign of Improvement

Although the soybean oil market has been stable for several consecutive markets, the sentiment in this city has shown little sign of improvement, and the market wants to rise but has fallen instead, due to the fact that the estimated arrival of Dalian oil in this month is about 17,000 to 18,000 barrels. Therefore, the amount of active chips on the market is wide and loose, and the sales volume is also rare, which leads to a sluggish decline. Yesterday, it was estimated that 50 pieces of Dalian and Qi oil were sold, with a price of 20 yuan for the original board, and 100 barrels of Fengnian oil in April were sold for 31 yuan and 5 cents. Now, 200 barrels of Dalian oil are sold for 32 yuan and 5 cents to 31 yuan and 8 cents, and 200 barrels are sold for 31 yuan and 9 cents and a half in three or four days, and 300 barrels are sold for 31 yuan and 8 and 9 cents in March, and 600 barrels are sold for 31 yuan and 7 and a half and 9 cents in April. Three thousand tins of peanut oil have been transported from Tianjin, and although people's hearts are stable, the market price has not had a significant impact. Yesterday, it was estimated that 10 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were sold, at 29 yuan and 3 cents, down 2 cents from the previous market. The price of canned oil was 50 tins of Qingdao oil, at 38 yuan and 8 cents, and 400 tins of Tianjin oil, at 38 yuan.

Yesterday, 4,270 bags of soybeans were transported from Tianjin, and 200 bags of soybeans were transported to Shantou, and 190 bags were transported to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: National Cloth Sold Mostly to Guangdong Buyers, Tianjin Mostly Used Japanese Goods

The sales of national cloth to buyer groups yesterday was most impressive to Guangdong. The sales in the stores on this street were excellent. The situation in eastern Zhejiang is still tense, and all parties are deeply guarded, and the buying appetite has decreased sharply. Yesterday, Wenzhou and Ningbo groups still shipped out more than 300 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, fusible yarn, bleached cloth, and foreign yarn, and the Guangdong group purchased more than 200 boxes of Feimeiren, Meirenyu, Juelu, and Xinshenglu brand colored cloth and colored twill, and nearly 100 boxes of plain fusibles, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, and etc., and nearly 200 bags of white goods, coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, etc. The dyeing factory on this street imported more than 200 pieces of colored twill raw cloth, and each had a wholesale transaction in fusible cloth, striped bleached cloth, and raw cloth. The market plate for each cargo is still trending firm. There is a shortage of spot goods in the market for colored twill and yarn plain fusibles and raw cloth. The spring and summer goods are very popular in the stores on this street, and medium and high-end bleached cloth and striped plain fusibles are the most popular. The work of each bleaching and refining factory is tense, and the output is slow, and there is a shortage of spot goods, and the raw cloth is abundant.

Because Tianjin merchants continued to purchase five to six hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, and the outflow of dyed twill on this street was also good, the white goods in Dong cloth were sold firmly, and the faucet fine twill was increased by one corner per piece due to the tight supply of spot goods, and sold for eleven yuan and nine corners. Dongmian Yangxing continued to collect 200 bags of blue double fish fine cloth and five-width fine twill, and the market situation became more stable.

Imports and Exports: Seventy-six pieces of piece goods were transported from Tianjin on the 23rd, and seven hundred and thirty-five pieces of piece goods were transported to Ningbo. On the 24th, three hundred and seventy-five pieces of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong, and three hundred and fifteen pieces were transported to Shantou.

### Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Gradually Feels Thorny

Yesterday's overseas silk market saw a mix of rises and falls. Yokohama spot prices fell by 20 yuan, and forward prices fell by 22 yuan. Lyon Japanese silk and Shanghai silk each rose by one franc, and New York Japanese silk 83 and 75 degrees each rose by one cent. However, the Exchange recently opened at the original price, and the distant prices fell by 3 cents, and the coarse striped silk fell by 5 cents.

The Shanghai silk market is still quiet. Foreign firms' purchase prices are more than 50 yuan away, and users have no intention to enter or exit, because the overseas silk market price has risen and fallen rapidly recently, and the local people's hearts are wavering. Moreover, Yokohama has also rumored the possibility of a devaluation of the Japanese yen, and there is no reliable way to solve the problem of this spring's purchase in this port, so the silk market is becoming more and more tranquil.

Today, 31 pieces of silk ends were transported to Italy, and 28 pieces of tea leaves were transported from Ningbo yesterday.

### North and South Goods: Almonds—The Market Soars High

Sweet almonds are also related to the control of a certain party, and the Shen City is tightening, and the arrival and inventory are thin, which is enough to help the price increase. The market price for Baiyu Bian has reached 200 yuan yesterday, and some are calling for more than 200 yuan. Longwang Bian is sold for 170 yuan to 160 yuan. The rising trend of bitter almonds has been slightly reduced, probably because the increase was too rapid.

Nine hundred bags of Shengren were transported from Weihaiwei the day before yesterday.

### Scarce Lily Bulb Slices

Lily bulb slices have recently seen a rise in price due to urgent demand from Hong Kong and a shortage of available stock in this area. Previously sold for 21 to 22 yuan, some customers with dozens of units are now asking for as high as 28 yuan (cash), and still seem reluctant to sell completely. It's understood that the total base stock in the producing area is no more than 300 units, and it's currently difficult to transport them to Shanghai, so the price is expected to continue rising.

### Paper - Tin Foil Prices Reduced

Since the Lunar New Year, sales of tin foil have been sluggish. With ample stock in Shanghai and repeated shipments arriving from the production areas, the market has struggled to maintain prices. However, with strong support from tin foil merchants, prices have not fallen sharply. Recently, manufacturers from Shaoxing have been discounting their products in Shanghai, making it difficult to maintain the original prices. Recently, with the Qingming Festival approaching, tin foil merchants, in order to boost sales both locally and in other regions, have uniformly reduced both retail and wholesale prices.

5,500 units of native paper arrived from Ningbo the day before yesterday.

### Coal - Abundant Supply of Soft Coal

No shortage of fuel in this city

Over the past week, large quantities of soft coal, amounting to over 30,000 loads, have flooded the market, making sales difficult and causing prices to plummet for several days, eventually halting trade. However, as the situation in eastern Zhejiang became tense, the market suddenly perked up, with prices rising by one or two "jiao." Large basket green coal is now priced at four yuan and five "jiao" per load, and bamboo charcoal at three yuan and two "jiao." It is said that trading among industry peers is quite active. However, due to abundant stocks, there is no fear of a fuel shortage in this city.

### Imports and Exports - Yao Flowers Dominate Imports

Yesterday's imports included 6,780 units of kiln goods shipped from Shantou, and 7,800 units of native paper from Ningbo.

Today, another shipment arrived from Ningbo, including over 10,600 units of Yao flowers, 200 units of cotton yarn, over 40 units of tobacco leaves, and 1,250 units of native paper, which is expected to be imported this morning via an Italian vessel.

### Japanese Troops Stealing Across the Fuchun River About to be Completely Annihilated

Japanese Objective to Threaten Nanchang

Encountered a Fierce Attack from Garrison Troops Immediately After Landing

Yao County Magistrate Cables Xiao and Shao for Peace

Following the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, Japanese troops stealing across the Fuchun River are about to be annihilated. Although Japanese warships are causing disturbances along the coast, Chinese military authorities have dispatched large reinforcements to defend the area. Xiao, Shao, Yong, and Wen have cabled to assure local peace. Details are as follows:

Japanese Troops Stealing Across About to be Annihilated

A small contingent of Japanese troops stole across the Fuchun River and, after landing, were met with a fierce attack from the garrison troops. The landing Japanese troops are about to be completely annihilated. It is understood that the Japanese troops' attempt to steal across the Fuchun River aimed to occupy the Linpu station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and then advance along the railway line to Zhuji and Jinhua. The landing Japanese troops, numbering about a hundred, were immediately met with a fierce attack by a large contingent of garrison troops and local defense forces on the riverbank. General Commander Liu of the Tenth Army Group has dispatched large reinforcements to defend the area. The Japanese troops' attempt will definitely not succeed.

Xiao, Shao, and Other Places Cable Assurance of Peace

The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai received a cable yesterday morning at 12:00 pm from the Yao County Magistrate, sent at 12:40 pm on the 22nd, stating: "Cable received, Xiao and Shao are at peace. County Magistrate Lin Yang Koutou." At the same time, shipping merchants received cables from Wenzhou and Ningbo, all stating that Ningbo and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang are at peace as usual. A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the Shaoxing Association in Shanghai that although Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to steal across the river and land at Wenjia Weir in Xiaoshan County in order to attack eastern Zhejiang, they have all been repelled by the garrison troops. All counties in eastern Zhejiang have long-distance telephone access. If the situation at Wenjia Weir were tense, the Yao County Magistrate would definitely not cable assurance of peace.

Zhenhai Fortress Safe and Sound

The Tanglu ship arrived in Shanghai from Yong the day before yesterday. According to a certain foreign passenger, one Japanese warship, one transport ship, and three destroyers are currently concentrated in the waters off Ligang outside Zhenhai. On Monday afternoon, they suddenly bombarded the Zhenhai fortress, with multiple shells landing near the fortress. The defending troops also returned fire. However, the Japanese warships fired indiscriminately, and the fortress is safe and sound. The Ningbo Defense Commander has ordered the evacuation of residents. When the ship passed Dinghai, it saw several Japanese warships patrolling the area.

Eastern Zhejiang Army Corps Numbering Approximately One Million

It was also mentioned that Jinhua in eastern Zhejiang is an important military base. The Japanese troops' direct actions against eastern Zhejiang indirectly threaten Nanchang. The Japanese troops have long intended to attack Nanchang, but have made no progress to date, and the price they have paid is incalculable. To attack Nanchang, they must first attack eastern Zhejiang. Currently, the Chinese army has a tight defense along the northeastern coast of Zhejiang, with the number of troops increased to 500,000, plus an additional organized commando unit, totaling approximately one million men. The defense is very solid, and there is no concern for security.

Ningbo Merchants Starting to Disperse Stockpiles

The Ningbo Defense Commander believes that coastal transportation to Ningbo is extremely important for commerce. If it were completely blockaded, the impact would be enormous. If necessary, a surface blockade can still be implemented immediately at any time. It is also learned that the Wenzhou and Ningbo chambers of commerce have issued orders, notifying all merchants that all goods stored in the above locations should be transported inland as a precautionary measure for war. Foreign shipping companies have decided to continue to operate their ships as usual.

Foreign Merchants Continue Eastern Zhejiang Shipping

Yesterday, inquiries were made with various foreign shipping companies. British, American, German, Portuguese, and other shipping companies have decided to continue to operate their ships as usual in eastern Zhejiang. Although the goods shipped from Shanghai to eastern Zhejiang have decreased sharply due to the current situation, there is a severe backlog of incoming goods. The Tanglu ship of the China-America Company arrived in Shanghai from Wen yesterday, and is scheduled to sail to Wen again tomorrow. The Tangsai ship of the China-America Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo yesterday. As for the Shantai ship of the Zhengde Company, it has been decided to change its departure time to 4:00 pm today. The Haifu and Hailong ships are scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wen tomorrow.

### Various Circles in This City Voluntarily Organize the National Spiritual Mobilization Association

Electing Seven Standing Committee Members to Preside Over Association Affairs

Since Chairman Chiang announced the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and Implementation Measures on the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the nation has been greatly excited, especially the leaders of various circles in this city, who are deeply moved. They have decided to contact each other in accordance with the organizational outline and organizational rules promulgated by the Municipal Party Headquarters, and voluntarily initiated the organization of the various circles of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association. After many days of preparation, it was officially established yesterday. Dozens of representatives from various circles attended, with the situation being extremely enthusiastic.

The association for divisional organization will also begin to proceed.

### Zhengzhou American Church Property Bombed Three Times by Japanese Aircraft

Five Patients Killed in Hospital Bombing

Two Hundred Refugees Killed in Shelter

Blatantly Disregarding American Flags

The Continental News reports: Yesterday (21st), it was learned from the Southern Baptist Convention Shanghai Headquarters that the American hospital operated by the Convention in Zhengzhou was hit by bombs during three air raids at the end of the week. It is said that five patients were killed in the hospital, and the shelter run by the Convention was also bombed, killing approximately 200 refugees. During the air raid on Friday, the hospital was directly hit by a skilled Japanese

Pilot.

The property suffered significant damage during the third air raid on Saturday, but no more patients died. According to confirmed information, Shanghai only received the simplest report. However, according to the local church authorities, the hospital and other properties of the church are marked with multiple large, brightly colored American flags. The closest

Chinese Military Facility

To the hospital etc. at the time of the most recent visit by Shanghai personnel was approximately half a mile away. According to Zhengzhou telegrams, the 200 refugees died in continuous air raids on Friday. Given the densely populated state of the city, it is feared that many civilians outside the shelter have also perished. It is believed here that there are currently six Americans in the Zhengzhou hospital, including four women. It is noted that the Southern Baptist Convention's property in Shanghai has already suffered

Significant Losses

Due to Japanese air raids. In addition, the Convention's hospital in Guilin was also set on fire by incendiary bombs, and a hospital in Chaozhou, southern China, was also destroyed. Church properties in Shandong have also been attacked several times. Church buildings in Jinan were hit by bombs and suffered significant damage. Yesterday, it was learned that after receiving a detailed report of the Zhengzhou air raid, the church authorities will file a strong protest with the Japanese through the American authorities.

### Steady Supply of Rice to Shanghai, Rice Prices Continue to Fall

Following the rice industry groups' efforts to stabilize prices and ensure a steady supply, rice prices in Shanghai have returned to normal in recent days. Moreover, due to clearing weather and convenient land and water transportation, rice stocks from the production areas are being continuously shipped to Shanghai. At the same time, spring has arrived, the weather is getting warmer, and some rice stocks cannot be stored for long. Owners are eager to sell, and rice shops are reducing their intake, so market prices continue to fall. The rice industry groups' price evaluation committee is actively investigating rice stocks and constantly monitoring market transactions. The Soybean and Rice Industry Market Management Committee is also strictly enforcing price limits and cracking down on private transactions to prevent manipulation.

### Commander of French Garrison Arrives in Shanghai

According to the North China Daily News, Colonel Granier, who succeeded Colonel Berthelot as commander of the French garrison in Shanghai, arrived in port yesterday (22nd) afternoon on a French mail steamer. Colonel Berthelot, French Consul General Baudézet, and many officers from the French naval and land garrisons, the French Concession Police Department, and the fire brigade were at the Bund in the French Concession to welcome him. Two detachments of French soldiers and French police were lined up along the wharf. As the new commander reviewed them, the police band played music. After the review, he was introduced to the officers present before they dispersed. Colonel Granier arrived here from Vietnam and will soon visit the commanders of the various garrisons, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Consular Body. Colonel Berthelot is scheduled to return to his country in mid-April to take office.

### Over a Hundred Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Forcibly Occupied by Puppet Organization

Arbitrarily Appraising the Assets of Each Factory

Plotting to Compel Shareholding Relationships

The silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have always been prosperous. After the war, more than a hundred large and small silk factories fell into enemy hands, with property losses amounting to tens of millions of yuan. Until recently, all the silk factories were forcibly occupied by the "Reformed" puppet organization, which seized them for its own benefit. However, it is still vigorously enticing the factories to join in cooperation, and promising to appraise the assets of each factory. The puppet "Finance" and "Industry" departments will separately issue a type of stock, marking the appraised amount, and notify the factories to come and collect it. Its purpose is to force the factories into a shareholding relationship, indirectly placing them under the control of the puppet organization. However, the factories are deeply aware of the greater cause and have seen through the puppet organization's conspiracy long ago. They have unanimously expressed their willingness to sacrifice to the end and refuse to submit and collude with the enemy.

### Puppet Police Invade Concession, Municipal Council Files Protest

Protest Lodged with Senior Consul

Stating It is Enough to Incite Terrorist Acts

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that Chinese personnel belonging to the Japanese Military Police are stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and Zhaopulu Bridge. The Director-General of the Municipal Council has lodged a protest with the Senior Consul regarding this matter. Also, during a recent gathering in Hongkou Park, the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" police performed their duties there. The Director-General has requested the consul country to take note of this fact, as Hongkou Park is the property of the Municipal Council. The Director-General is concerned that any Chinese people in uniform or carrying weapons, other than the personnel of the Municipal Council's Police Department, may take actions within the Public Concession that are sufficient to incite the terrorist acts that the Municipal Council is eager to prevent from occurring within the Concession. These actions are inconsistent with the rules and all previous conventions.

Therefore, we are issuing this notice again, urging all schools that have not yet completed the procedures to make payments to the various Shanghai banks before the 27th of this month to clear the procedures. This is specially notified.

### Japanese Troops' Attack on Luhui Intercepted, Zhagang Burned Again

It Will Not Be Easy to Restore the Old Appearance of the Entire Town

Japanese Troops Went to Guard the Wharf Again Yesterday Morning

Zhagang Town, located along the Pu River in Nanhui County, Pudong, was landed on and set on fire by Japanese troops the day before yesterday, burning for several hours and turning the entire town into ashes. The town has suffered

Unprecedented Disaster For the Second Time.

More than a thousand male and female refugees, old and young, have been left homeless and wandering in the surrounding countryside, in a state of utter misery. The town was previously destroyed by Japanese warships last year, and after some time, the victims gradually returned and built grass huts, of which there are now more than two hundred.

Restoring the Old Appearance

Moreover, the town is the only important entrance and exit along the Pu River in Nanhui, and has thus become abnormally developed. After this great fire, the entire town has been leveled, and it will not be easy to restore its former prosperity. Previously, the day before yesterday (22nd) at 10:00 am, seven Japanese motorboats sailed from Minhang, loaded with 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers, and were escorted by a small

Warship To Land

The Japanese troops forcibly landed and first seized more than 30 empty rice boats parked along the riverbank, preventing them from sailing away. They also arrested three ordinary civilians on the wharf, and then searched the town, but found no traces of guerrillas. They then attempted to advance eastward

Searching for Luhui

Town (Luhui was occupied by Japanese troops but was forced to retreat to Xinchang due to harassment by guerrillas. Luhui has therefore been recovered.) Unexpectedly, when the Japanese troops were three li away from Zhagang Town, they were intercepted and attacked by Fan Gencai's guerrilla unit, leading to a fierce battle that lasted for more than an hour. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and retreated back to the town. By this time, the townspeople had

Fled Completely.

Even the elderly were few and far between. The Japanese troops then set fire to the town, and the entire town of grass huts was instantly engulfed in flames, with thick smoke rising high into the sky, a truly tragic scene. It could even be faintly seen from the high-rise buildings on the isolated island. Subsequently, as the guerrillas approached, the Japanese soldiers began to retreat and board the motorboats at 1:00 pm, escaping. The three arrested civilians were also taken away, and their fate is unknown.

The Town's Flames

Burned until dusk the day before yesterday before being extinguished. The guerrillas rushed into the town, but because all the buildings had been destroyed, there were no fortifications to defend, so they retreated back to the countryside. Yesterday (23rd) morning, more than ten Japanese soldiers took motorboats escorted by warships and landed on the Zhagang riverbank wharf to guard it.

Small Warships

Four were anchored in the river, and more than ten motorboats carrying Japanese soldiers were shuttling along the Pu River area around Zhagang, Dujiagang, Wangjiadu, and Xinlonghua, searching civilian boats. The situation is still quite serious. However, the more than 30 empty rice boats that had been seized were released yesterday morning.

### Municipal Council Protests Traffic Regulations, Japanese Side Studying Diplomatic Procedures

Stating Based on Municipal Council Regulations

Due to Unsatisfactory Traffic in the Northern District

According to the Continental News, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces announced additional traffic regulations in Hongkou and Yangshupu. Yesterday (21st), it was learned that the Municipal Council considered this to be an illegal act and had sent a protest letter to the Japanese authorities. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy claimed last night when receiving reporters from various newspapers that the Japanese authorities were currently "studying" the Municipal Council's diplomatic procedures. He also claimed that the regulations were based on the traffic regulations of the Municipal Council's Police Department, with some additions, given that the traffic in the Northern District was definitely unsatisfactory, hence this measure was taken to implement effective traffic management. When asked if the Japanese authorities had requested the Municipal Council to implement these regulations, the spokesman replied that they had requested the Municipal Council to publicize the regulations. One reporter asked if the official in charge of the Municipal Council's Traffic Department was specially trained at the London Metropolitan Police Service, and if the drafter of the Japanese regulations was also specially trained, as some of the regulations seemed to have unclear implications. The spokesman replied that the drafter of the Japanese regulations had considerable experience in traffic management and had conducted special studies of the situation in the area of implementation before formulating these rules.

### Japanese Side Continues to Transport Copper and Iron in Nanshi

A Total of Five Trucks Transported to Hongkou

Since the fall of Shanghai, the Japanese troops have transported the machinery from factories in the city that had not been moved out to Hongkou to set up their own factories. At the same time, due to the huge consumption of military supplies, domestic raw materials have become scarce, so they are scavenging damaged and discarded copper and iron to transport them to the country for use as raw materials for manufacturing military supplies. Yesterday morning from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, the Japanese troops hired five transport trucks, loaded two trucks of small machinery and three trucks of scrap copper and iron in Nanshi, and all drove to Hongkou to wait for shipment to Japan by sea.

### Japanese Troops Advance on Xisu by Land and Water, Chinese Troops Under Deng Break Through

Reported Guerrillas Recovered Luodian

Puppet Police Station in Nanshi Attacked

According to people from Wuxi, approximately two hundred Japanese troops stationed in the cities of Wuxi and Suzhou, fully armed and carrying four light machine guns and one steel cannon, set out in separate routes the day before yesterday (21st) towards the intersection of Xisu. One route advanced along the small road of Mudu River, and the other set out from Wangting Railway Station by land, attacking the stationed Chinese troops with a pincer movement by land and water. At that time, the Chinese troops were in a precarious situation and were almost completely surrounded. Subsequently, the Dadao Team of Deng Benyin's troops served as the vanguard, and the remaining soldiers, with a determination to die, vowed to fight the Japanese troops to the end to repay their debt. Therefore, they fought fiercely, and the two sides fought to the death. As a result, the Chinese troops managed to break through. The Dadao Team captured a considerable number of Japanese troops under heavy fire, and the Chinese troops also sacrificed forty to fifty soldiers.

Recovery of Luodian

The commander of the Baoshan guerrillas, the night before last (22nd), led his team from ××× to encircle the Japanese troops. As it was late at night, and the Japanese troops in the area were newly transferred from Hangzhou, they were unfamiliar with the terrain and panicked. It is said that they fled in disorder, and the Fan unit annihilated more than half of them, capturing more than ten alive,

And seized a lot of light and heavy ammunition. After winning the victory, Fan left a portion of warriors to guard Luodian and led the team back to their original location.

Night Raid on Zhuqiao

The commander of the South River and Three Counties guerrillas, Ding Xueshan, on the morning of the day before yesterday (21st), during the quiet and peaceful hours of the night, unexpectedly attacked the Japanese military base in Zhuqiao. He surrounded the Japanese troops from all sides, selected another team of warriors to break into the Japanese camp, engaging in hand-to-hand combat and fighting to the death for two hours. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, and Ding led his team to pursue them, intercepting a Japanese transport vehicle in the middle, capturing three Japanese soldiers alive, and returning in triumph.

Puppet Police Attacked

Last night (22nd), the sound of gunfire was very dense, and could be clearly heard on the border of the French Concession. After investigation, it was learned that guerrillas attacked the Nanshi puppet police station, killing or wounding more than ten puppet police officers. It is said that Wang Zhizhang, the puppet police chief, was also injured. When the Japanese guard troops heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, the guerrillas had already fled. The Japanese soldiers then searched nearby residents, but found nothing.

### Detailed Interrogation

It was necessary that by the summer of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, it was ruled to overturn the original verdict and send the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for a new trial. After one hearing, the matter was adjourned for another trial. It is now learned that the Third Branch of the High Court, due to the fact that the informants in the case, Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, were assigned to serve on the battlefield after the "August 13th" battle while in the Beixinjing Prison and have since disappeared, the case cannot proceed and the trial has been suspended. It was reported to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Supreme Court for verification the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter suddenly heard at a friend's banquet that of the two informants in the case, Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, Zhang Tinggui is indeed missing, but Zhao Guangfu was recently arrested in the Public Concession for robbery and sentenced to seven years in prison by the First Special District Court. However, he has changed his name, but the French police have discovered this and will bring Zhao to justice in the near future to continue the interrogation. The above information was stated by a friend with certainty, but whether it is true or not will become clear in the near future. As for another instigator, Wang Xinggao from Funing, his case was also sent back by the Supreme Court to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. At that time, Wang paid 20,000 yuan for bail, but the Third Branch of the High Court repeatedly failed to locate him and confiscated the bail money. It is recently rumored that Wang has become a traitor and was killed by guerrillas in Jiangbei. However, according to the reporter's investigation, Wang Xinggao is currently indeed in the Tonghai Qi area of Beisha, forming four guerrilla teams under the command of Zhang Nengren and Ding Jutang.

Poisoning Policy
Invasion of Concessions
Many Cases Cracked in Recent Days
The French Concession Police Department has been actively dispatching detectives to clear out drug dens within the concession in recent days. It is now learned that three more drug dens have been cracked in the area yesterday and the day before: (1) No. 17, Lane 918, Xiafei Road, where 200 packs of morphine were seized, each pack worth five yuan, totaling 1,000 yuan, and one Korean and seven Chinese, including Zhu Liangtian and Huang Muquan, were arrested; (2) No. 7, Huanlong Lane, Huanlong Road, where one Korean female drug dealer was arrested and over 200 packs of five-yuan morphine were seized; (3) No. 23, Guanhua Lane, Lafayett Road, where two Korean women were arrested and over 300 packs of morphine were seized. The Chinese criminals will be handed over to the court for investigation, while the Korean male and female criminals will be sent to the Japanese Consulate for punishment.

Impersonating Narcotics Bureau Personnel
Intimidating People for Money
Arrested by Detectives on the Spot
Two Accomplices on the Run, Strict Investigation Underway
The Public Concession Police Authority has always strictly prohibited opium and drugs. In addition to investigations by officers from various police stations, a specialized Narcotics Bureau has been established to handle matters related to banning smoking and drugs. Recently, some individuals have been taking advantage of the opportunity to impersonate detectives and extort money from residents possessing smoking paraphernalia. Because the victims have also violated the law, they dare not report to the police. As a result, these people have become even bolder and extort money arbitrarily.

Yesterday afternoon at 7:30 PM, Wu Peinian, a Henan native (also known as Wu Peiran, a detective from the Central Private Detective Agency that has been sealed by the court), along with Wu Yongsheng and Cha Quansheng, suddenly went to the home of Ye Xiaosan at No. 8, Songyang Lane, Xiamen Road, claiming to be personnel from the Narcotics Bureau of the Police Department. They said that they had received a tip-off that Ye's family had opium. They then took out two forged informant letters with the attached note instructing detectives to investigate and report back, as well as a detective license (issued by the Central Detective Agency) as proof. Ye Xiaosan, unaware that Wu and others were impersonating police detectives, was greatly alarmed because his aunt had smoking paraphernalia. He immediately took out 25 yuan in legal tender and handed it over to Wu Yongsheng, asking to be spared arrest. At this moment, a detective from the Narcotics Bureau, Li Shugui, happened to pass by and inquired about the situation. Wu claimed to be the detective chief, Ye Yuxi, from the Narcotics Bureau. However, the detective Su knew Detective Ye and realized that Wu was an imposter. He grabbed Wu Peinian, while the others, Wu Yongsheng and Cha Quansheng, seeing that things were going badly, immediately seized the opportunity to escape. Detective Li reported the incident and, together with Detective Shen Tianbao from the Zhabei Police Station, rushed to the scene, arrested Wu Peinian, and confiscated the two forged informant letters and the detective license. However, the 25 yuan in stolen money had already been taken by Wu Yongsheng and could not be recovered.

Yesterday morning, Wu was handed over to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Judge Feng Shide opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case and filed charges of impersonating public officials and extortion under Articles 158 and 346 of the Criminal Code. He stated that there must be many similar cases, but they have not been cracked because the victims are afraid to report to the police. The defendants must have committed the same crimes in more cases than just this one. The Police Department needs to investigate the defendant's crimes and apprehend the accomplices who are on the run. Therefore, he requested that the case be adjourned for further interrogation after the hearing and that the two letters and the detective license confiscated from the defendant be presented to the court for inspection. Ye Xiaosan then recounted the ordeal of being intimidated and extorted, stating that his aunt was old and had become ill and bedridden due to the fright she received yesterday and could not come to court to testify. Judge Feng questioned the defendant Wu Peinian and then ordered him to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.

Life Bookstore Branch in Wanxian Bombed
Generous Compensation for Deceased Employees
During the war of resistance, the Life Bookstore dispatched capable employees to operate branches in the front lines, rear areas, and guerrilla zones, reaching more than 40 locations. They were always the last to retreat from the front lines, always the first to set up charity sales in the rear areas, and worked hard to promote culture and strengthen resistance in the guerrilla zones by giving up copyright profits. Most of the bookstore's cadres were young people who were passionate about cultural and educational work, valued their duties, and strictly observed discipline. On February 4th, enemy planes bombed Wanxian, and the Life Bookstore branch in Wanxian was completely destroyed. Employee He Zhongwu died with the store. The cultural circles of Wanxian expressed deep sympathy and condolences, and over 100 students volunteered to participate in the excavation. The bookstore's general management area, considering that Mr. He died on duty, decided to provide 200 yuan for funeral expenses and extend condolences to his family, in accordance with the regulations. In addition, it was decided that his family would continue to receive Mr. He's original salary on a monthly basis for a period of 20 years, until January of the 46th year of the Republic. Colleagues also planned to hold a memorial service for Mr. He, provide financial assistance to his family, and provide permanent care for his children. This generous compensation and concern for the families of the deceased is sufficient to encourage the bookstore's more than 200 employees to work hard, be dedicated to their duties, and not fear danger. It can serve as a model for the business community.

Theft of Hats is Rampant
Large Numbers of Thieves Arrested
Prosecuted for Theft, Possession of Stolen Goods, and Drug Use

They also arrested two receivers of stolen goods, Chen Xiqiang and Gu Kunyuan, and recovered 22 stolen felt hats. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Liao of the First Criminal Division heard the case. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer for the French Concession Administrative Authority, filed charges of robbery, drug use, theft, and receiving stolen goods. Among the defendants, Wang Haisheng, Wu Xiaomao, He Houcai, and Li Jisheng confessed to robbing hats, two admitted to stealing cigarettes, and the rest admitted to using drugs. Chen and Gu admitted to receiving stolen goods. The court verified the confessions and adjourned the case for further investigation. The defendants remain in custody.

Casino Bloodshed
Gao Binggen Forced Collection of Gambling Debts
Wang Shouzhang Opened Fire
Wang Shouzhang, a former detective from the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, has a long history of criminal activity and has been wanted by the concessions many times. Recently, he colluded with Japanese and puppet thugs to open a casino in Yongyuanbang, Huxi, profiting from the rake. Because of his violent behavior, he accumulated many enemies. The other night, he was provoked by Gao Binggen, a Suzhou native, who was forcing him to collect gambling debts in the casino. Enraged, Wang drew a pistol and fired six shots at Gao, hitting him in the waist and arm. Gao was seriously injured and fell to the ground. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Wang seized the opportunity to escape. The police have learned that the main culprit, Wang Shouzhang, has a history of outstanding cases, so they have strictly ordered his arrest for investigation and prosecution.

After learning of this, the department dispatched personnel day and night to investigate. It was discovered that this was the work of a group of Jiangbei rogues hiding in a shed near the Xue residence. Yesterday morning at around 9 AM, led by Team Leader Gao Tao Yun, a large number of members went to search the area. Unexpectedly, they were discovered and the rogues opened fire first, resulting in the death of team member Lu Shunlin. The bandits all managed to escape.

Local merchants were saddened to hear that Patriot Lu died for the public good.

Tourist Fell to Death in Amusement Park
Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, an unidentified man, approximately 40 years old, wearing a herringbone overcoat, a Western-style short jacket, a felt hat, and black leather shoes, fell from the roof of an amusement park in the French Concession and died.

They also filed a civil lawsuit seeking the return of the suitcase.

Both sides arrived with their lawyers. The defendant presented photos of the family division agreement.

The court stopped her and explained the importance of respect and seniority. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that a Mr. Gu was willing to mediate the case and requested an adjournment. The court stated that the civil lawsuit could be settled out of court, but the criminal part must still be tried according to law. The case involves family members.

Step-Mother Sues for Living Expenses
Yu Zuoting Testifies in Court
Maintenance Should be Paid by the Administrator
The Debate Concluded, Judgment on the 27th
Li Xu, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 16, Lane 341, Maitershast Road, Huxi, previously hired lawyer Kong Zhaozhang to represent her in the Second Special District Civil Court, filing a lawsuit against Li Zuhuai, Li Zumei, and Li Zukai, the sons of her late husband Li Beiping, and Li Yao, the legal representative of Zumei and Zukai (residing at No. 102, Xiafei Lane, Xiafei Road), seeking payment of living expenses. The complaint stated that in the seventh year of the Republic, Li Beiping (a native of Yong) took the plaintiff as his concubine. Li Beiping died in the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Republic. In addition to houses and land, he left 611,600 yuan in cash, all managed by Yao alone. The plaintiff received 250 yuan per month for living expenses. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, when the estate was divided with the testimony of group leader Li Yongsheng and relative Yu Zuoting, the plaintiff was given 10,000 yuan in cash, and 2,200 yuan per year was allocated from the ancestral property for her living expenses. The ancestral property was managed in rotation by the three sons Zuhuai, Zumei, and Zukai. However, Zumei and Zukai were young and managed by their mother Yao. The eldest son Zuhuai agreed to provide the plaintiff's living expenses from the ancestral property, but Yao, the mother of Zumei and Zukai, deliberately made things difficult, and the living expenses for the twenty-seventh year have not been paid. She requested that the defendants be ordered to pay the living expenses. Judge Wu Xiaoke held a hearing, and the defendants appeared in court with their lawyers. The hearing was adjourned, and Yu Zuoting was summoned to testify at a later date. The details have been reported in the previous issue. Yesterday, another hearing was held. The parties were still represented by their lawyers. Witness Yu Zuoting testified that he had participated in the Li family's division of property and signed the contract. At that time, in addition to giving the plaintiff 10,000 yuan, he would provide her with 2,200 yuan per year for living expenses from the ancestral property until the plaintiff came of age. The ancestral property was managed by the three sons in rotation. The administrator was responsible for paying the living expenses. The defendant's reason was that most of the ancestral property was in the occupied area, and it was impossible to collect income, so it was impossible to pay. The court verified the testimony, ruled that the case was clear, ordered a debate, and announced the conclusion, setting the judgment for the 27th.

To the Editor
I am writing in response to the news item published in your newspaper on the 15th of this month regarding the accusation of Liu Yingcen by his two nephews. The facts are completely inconsistent and seriously affect my reputation. My two nephews are now aware of their mistake and have published apologies to me in the Shen Bao on the 19th and the Xinwen Bao on the 20th. The facts of the false accusation are now clear. The original story is that I have an older sister who married Shen Jinwen from Yangzhou. My brother-in-law passed away in the third year of the Republic, and my older sister passed away in the winter of the eleventh year of illness, leaving behind one daughter and three sons. The eldest daughter, Kui Di, married a rice merchant surnamed Zhou. After the death of her parents, she was responsible for taking care of all of their belongings. The eldest son, Jiezi, studied classics and worked in Jiangbei Pincha Town. Juezi was raised by me, and the third son, Yizi, lived with his aunt (my younger sister). Later, Kui Di and her husband became addicted to opium and used up their own rice shop and the family belongings in their care. Jiezi also lost his job due to misappropriating accounts. Juezi studied in a clothing store in Rugao and unfortunately passed away last year due to illness. Yizi's original profession was Chinese medicine, but he liked to wander and could not settle down. When he had no place to go, he would live with me. Recently, he was introduced to a job by his cousin Liu Yanxiang. After Jiezi lost his job, he repeatedly asked me for loans. Recently, he even wanted more and demanded assistance. I gave him 10 yuan in legal tender and asked him to sign a receipt so that he would not pester me again. Who knew that Jiezi would become angry and resentful and collude with his brother to falsely accuse me of seizing their mother's property. Now, after discussion in court and mediation by relatives and friends, and in order to appease the people and out of consideration for the feelings between siblings, I gave my two nephews travel expenses to return to their hometown, as requested by the mediators. My two nephews have also repented and published an apology to me in the newspaper. I respectfully request that the facts of the letter be published to clarify the truth, correct public opinion, and protect my reputation. I am deeply grateful. Sincerely, Liu Yingcen, March 23.

To the Editor, On the afternoon of the 18th of this month at 4 PM, a patient named Shen Yougen, suffering from inguinal lymphadenitis, came to our hospital and was admitted to the general ward. At 4 AM the next morning, he was arrested by the police for theft. Your newspaper published a report on the 21st with only the words "Darui Hospital," causing some of my friends to mistakenly believe that it was a hospital employee. Therefore, I am reporting the facts in the hopes that you will publish them in the letter column to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, the Administration Office of Darui Hospital, March 23.

National Medicine and Dietary Therapy Special Issue on Measles

Infantile "Measles" Conditions and Dietary Procedures by Chen Cunren

Since the beginning of spring, measles has been prevalent among children. Recently, Shanghai has suffered a shortage of housing, with dozens of elderly and young people living in each small house, resulting in rapid transmission of the disease. Lately, the weather has been abnormal, with cold and heat occurring irregularly, making it even easier for measles to spread. This publication has recently received many manuscripts on measles, so we have specially selected several articles and compiled them into a "Measles Special Issue." This article is a revised version of my old manuscript and is published together.

The Period Before Measles Breaks Out
If a child has a fever that does not subside for three to five days, with teary eyes, nausea, occasional coughing, fatigue, and listlessness, they are likely to develop measles. If light red spots with slightly white crystalline dots are seen on the inner cheek muscles, it is a sure sign of measles. Measles spots will appear within two to three days. At this time, the child should eat a vegetarian diet, the less food the better. A little rice and thin soup is sufficient, with only a small amount of vegetarian dishes such as Chinese cabbage, cabbage, and tofu. Sugary and cold foods should be avoided.

Formulas for Use Before Measles Breaks Out, Often Drunk in Place of Water, Easy Cases are Simple and Light, Difficult Cases, Although the Medication is Appropriate, Are Still the Most Annoying and Difficult Times, Such as Drinking Cold Products or Cooling Foods, Easy to Make the Symptoms Worse.

The Period When Measles Breaks Out
The best drink to have when measles spots appear is water boiled with water chestnuts. Drinking it as tea in the morning and evening helps with urination, purifies the blood, clears phlegm, and promotes the eruption of measles. This is the best remedy. At this time, the child may not want to eat. Vegetable dishes are not necessary. If the condition is good, the measles spots are strong, and the child looks well, a thin porridge is still suitable when the child wants to eat. Side dishes are limited to jellyfish skin and water chestnut slices. Although jellyfish is hard, it is immediately digested when it meets alkaline liquid in the stomach, and its function is to clear phlegm. Water chestnuts can clear phlegm and aid digestion.

After Measles Breaks Out Completely
Measles is considered "completely erupted" when it spreads to the nose and feet. Before measles is completely erupted, all that is eaten are medicines that promote eruption and relieve fever. The temperature in the room should be kept warm. The biggest concern is the possibility of the measles receding due to cold. However, once it is "completely erupted," everything is reversed. The use of medication gradually shifts to clearing, and cooling foods are no longer restricted. Moreover, cooling drinks should be consumed after the measles is completely erupted. The order is as follows:
On the first day after measles is completely erupted, continue to boil water chestnuts to make tea or use fresh water chestnut stalks (sold dried in pharmacies, called 通天草, about a few copper coins can buy it) to boil water. This is also good. On the second day, boil two taels of water chestnuts and reed root together for drinking. From the third day onward, boil ten water chestnuts, two taels of reed root, and two bundles of imperata root together for drinking.

Side Dishes: (1) Clear salt mixed with tofu, (2) Mixed tofu skin, (3) Mixed Pinghu rice cake, (4) Jellyfish skin, rotate among the four.
At this time, limit the child to porridge. Rice water porridge can be eaten. The porridge should be thin for the first three days and thicker after four days. Milk is also not suitable, and bread, biscuits, and sugary foods should be eaten in small quantities.

Three kinds of fruits can be eaten: oranges can stimulate the appetite, pears can cleanse the lungs, and red sugarcane can clear measles toxins and is very beneficial.
After measles, there are often measles toxins, so it is advisable to eat more imperata root tea and red sugarcane juice (red sugarcane is produced in Guangdong, with purple skin and white flesh, about four to five feet long) and Guangdong bamboo knot tea (sold in Guangdong grocery stores), for about ten to fifteen days.

Prevention of Post-Measles Tuberculosis
After measles, the lungs are often heated and burned, resulting in coughs that do not stop in the morning and evening. At this time, it is best to be careful. Light apricot kernel dew and loquat leaf dew can be eaten. In addition, a doctor should be consulted for medication. Seven out of ten children develop post-measles

### Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index

Rent Increases the Most

Food and Miscellaneous Items Secondary

The China Branch of the International Labour Office has released the Shanghai workers' cost of living index for January of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], which is 159.32, an increase of 2.83 percent compared to December of the previous year, a decrease of 4.49 percent compared to January of the previous year, and still an increase of 45.48 percent compared to the pre-war July index of 109.51. This month, among the various categories, 25 items saw an increase compared to the previous month, 19 items saw a decrease, and 14 items remained the same. Except for clothing, all other categories showed an increase. The most significant increase was in rent, followed by food, and then miscellaneous items. Fuel remained similar to the previous month, with only a 0.07 percent increase. Clothing, on the other hand, decreased by 2.52 percent compared to the previous month. The fluctuations in each category are summarized below:

Most Food Items Increase

This month, rice prices rebounded, with japonica rice increasing by more than half a yuan compared to the previous month, and indica rice and glutinous rice increasing by about one yuan. It was the beginning of the Gregorian calendar year and the end of the Lunar calendar year, resulting in higher demand. Additionally, the weather turned colder, leading to a decrease in supply. Furthermore, heavy taxes and the Japanese control of rice production in guerrilla areas, with large shipments exported, caused rice prices to rise sharply. Flour stocks were insufficient, and raw materials were lacking, pushing market prices higher. Large quantities of pork and beef arrived in Shanghai, causing meat prices to fall slightly. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the demand for chicken was high, and prices continued to rise. Soybean oil was in short supply and selling well, causing prices to rebound. After price controls were implemented on salt, prices trended upwards. The index for this category is 122.60, an increase of 3.28 percent compared to the previous month.

Rent Continues to Rise

Although there are changes in rent, it is rare for increases or decreases to occur repeatedly within a year. Therefore, its fluctuations are not as frequent as those of commodity prices. Rent surveys are typically conducted once a year. However, since the start of the war in August of the 26th year [1937], Shanghai rents have risen rapidly and significantly, so the survey was changed to twice a year. The first survey this year, conducted in January, showed that bungalows increased by another 5.86 percent compared to the second half of the 27th year [1938], Western-style houses increased by 5.19 percent, and shikumen houses increased by 0.41 percent. The index for this month is 315.08, an increase of 4.48 percent compared to the previous month.

Water, Electricity, and Housing Taxes All Increase

At the beginning of the war, Shanghai residents left the city in droves, numbering in the tens of thousands daily, mainly the wealthy and lower-middle classes. The working class had numerous connections and few belongings. If they had travel funds, they left quickly without hesitation. When the Shanghai war ended, they returned one after another, initially staying with relatives and friends and then searching for housing. However, the number of houses in the concessions was limited, and rents had already soared. According to this month's survey, there were frequent changes in workers' residences, with moving families accounting for 20 percent of the surveyed figures. With people from the mainland constantly arriving in Shanghai, there were few houses and many people, leading to an imbalance in supply and demand. Rent was bound to increase. Where could cheap housing be found? A three-story building in an ordinary neighborhood could house more than ten families, with around fifty people. The key money often amounted to one or two thousand yuan. However, tenants only sought housing, regardless of rent or key money. It was inevitable that landlords would take the opportunity to raise prices. As for workers, most rented from second or third landlords, adding to their burden. If the main landlord increased the rent, the second and third landlords would not only not object but would welcome it, as they had an excuse to increase the rent substantially. Moreover, increases in water, electricity, and housing taxes were also used as reasons to raise rent. However, the increase in rent far exceeded the increase in water, electricity, and housing taxes.

Clothing and Fuel Remain Stable

Coarse cloth, fine cloth, and bleached cloth remained firm in the market. Striped cloth, patterned cloth, woolen cloth, flannel, and socks saw a decrease in price. In this category, decreases outnumbered increases, and the index fell by 2.52 percent. Among fuel items, firewood was the most consumed. This month, the supply was scarce, and retail prices rose slightly. The supply of Wenzhou charcoal remained scarce, and prices trended upwards. Coal briquette prices fell slightly. The index hovered around 235. The prices of miscellaneous items were similar to the previous month, with little change. Yellow wine prices increased significantly. The index for this month is 170.16, an increase of 1.53 percent compared to the previous month.

### Japanese Side Opens Qingdao Outer Harbor, Allowing Foreign Ships to Enter

Except When Militarily Necessary

The Yangtze River Will Be Opened Based on This Principle

According to external news from this port, the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao recently issued a statement saying that Qingdao Outer Harbor would be opened on the 25th, allowing foreign ships to enter. A Japanese spokesperson also told reporters that except when militarily necessary, the principle of opening Qingdao Outer Harbor could be applied to the Yangtze River.

Reuter, Qingdao, 23rd: The Japanese Consul-General here formally announced this morning that Qingdao Port will be opened on the 25th of this month, allowing ships from third countries to enter and exit.

### Children's Day: Children's Groups to Tour Gardens for Free

At the Same Time, Major Hospitals and Sanatoriums

Will Provide Free Examinations and Treatment for Children

This year, April 4th is the 8th Children's Day in our country. According to news from the Children's Day Preparatory Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement has informed the Shanghai Office of the China Philanthropic Association that all gardens within the Public Settlement (such as Zhaofeng Garden, Dahua Garden, Jiaozhou Road Garden, and others, including Huishan Garden, Hongkou Garden, and the Bund Garden) will be open on Children's Day. Children's groups from the city can visit in groups. However, for every twenty children visiting, there must be at least one adult to accompany them to take care of everything. As for when to visit, how many people will visit, and which garden to visit, each children's group must immediately report to the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association, which will report to the Municipal Council to handle the issuing of permits. It is reported that the office has decided to report to the Municipal Council on March 28th. It is hoped that all children's tour groups will complete the reporting procedures before the 28th, otherwise they will lose the right to visit. According to news from the Children's Day Preparatory Committee, major hospitals and sanatoriums in the city, such as Baolong Hospital, Renhe Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Tongren Hospital, Dahua Hospital, Sanmin Hospital, China Hospital, Shanghai Hospital, Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital, Shanghai Women and Children's Hospital, Huilv Sanatorium, Sino-Western Sanatorium, Minzhong Sanatorium, Pingmin Sanatorium, Xiehe Sanatorium, China Model Ophthalmology Hospital, Datong Dental Hospital, Children's Dental Hospital, China Dental Protection Institute, Shanghai Dental Clinic, China Red Cross Third Hospital, China Medical Association Health Experimental Zone, etc., have decided to provide free medical treatment for children on this Children's Day. Some hospitals have expressed their willingness to provide medicines (including injections, internal medicine, external medicine), free X-rays, free vaccinations, various preventive injections, free physical examinations for children, tooth cleaning, and children's health lectures. Other well-known hospitals and sanatoriums are still sending notices. All detailed lists and procedures will be officially published in the newspapers on April 3rd. Please pay attention to children and parents in the city. Various charitable organizations will also visit orphaned children in various shelters on Children's Day. Child relief organizations such as the Orphan Education Institute will hold commemorative meetings separately.

### Postal Service Suspends Sending Scattered Packages to Eastern Zhejiang Yesterday

Small Parcels

Still Operating as Usual

Because of traffic obstruction and transportation difficulties between Shanghai and Zhejiang, and parcels piled up like mountains going to various counties in eastern Zhejiang, the Shanghai Postal Administration stopped receiving large parcels the day before yesterday (the 22nd). Except for Wenzhou and Ningbo, the rest of the individual parcels have also been stopped. In addition, two announcements were made, (1) Due to transportation difficulties, all parcels sent to or transferred through Yin County and Yongjia should be temporarily suspended from acceptance, but individual parcels sent to the main ports of Yin County and Yongjia can still be accepted as usual. (2) From now on, large parcels sent to Yin County and Yongjia, and their transshipments, will be suspended from acceptance.

### Parcels Sent to Zhili and Shandong Must Have Permits Attached

Notice from Shanghai Post Office

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1531: It has been found that parcels sent to various places in Shandong and Hebei Provinces containing items such as leather, hemp, and wool, etc., will not be accepted by this office unless accompanied by a permit. This notice is hereby announced for general information. This notice is issued by Director Zha Peilin on March 22nd, the 28th year of the Republic of China.

### Electricity Users Terminating Service: Additional Tax Rates Determined Separately

Those Terminating in April of This Year

Calculated at 32.5 Percent

The Shanghai Power Company has already increased the price of electricity used by factories and the cost of electricity for household lighting in the concessions. However, some ordinary users have applied to terminate their electricity use due to the high cost of electricity. Whether the temporary surcharge to be added should be added as well has been agreed upon by Hua Gengde, Secretary and Treasurer of the company, and the Director of Finance of the Shanghai Municipal Council. For ordinary users terminating their electricity use within April 1939, the temporary surcharge to be added to their bill will be 32.5 percent. A notice has now been issued.

### Sale of the Broadway Mansions: Terms Agreed

Japanese Merchants Have Not Paid Yet

The Mainland News reports that yesterday (the 21st) it was learned that regarding the sale of the Broadway Mansions on the Suzhou Creek, although the original British owner and a Japanese business group had agreed on the terms some time ago, the sale is still on hold because the Japanese buyers have not paid the purchase price. Regarding the news published in the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, which stated that "the long-rumored sale" will be implemented next Saturday and Sunday, the reporter inquired about this matter yesterday and learned the above news. According to the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, British Commercial Broadcasting Company has sold the building to the Japanese Shanghai Real Estate Company for 5.1 million yuan. The building was built in 1932 and completed three years later. If it were to be built at the current price, it would cost more than twice the price demanded by the British company.

### Sharp Decrease in Labor-Management Disputes in Shanghai During the War of Resistance

Labor and Management Uphold the Spirit of Cooperation and Mutual Understanding

Labor Administration Institutions Have Tended to Stall

Shanghai is the industrial center of China. The government had established an arbitration committee and a mediation committee to handle labor-management disputes in accordance with the Law on the Handling of Labor-Management Disputes. After the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, Shanghai's labor administration institutions tended to stall, and the handling of labor-management dispute events was left to the Special District Local Court. At the same time, the Industrial Section of the Public Settlement Engineering Bureau also engaged in mediation. However, after the war, Shanghai's industrial districts were reduced to ashes. During the War of Resistance, both labor and management in the concessions accepted the government's advice and worked hard to increase production and reduce unnecessary disputes, upholding the spirit of labor-management cooperation. Therefore, labor-management disputes after the war were greatly reduced. For example, starting in September, there were no disputes in October and November, and two disputes in December. The number of disputes in 1938 was greatly reduced compared to before the war. However, due to the lack of formal mediation and arbitration organizations, even very small disputes easily escalated. Disputes after the war were mostly about reducing wages, strikes, reducing working hours, closures, and requests to restore wages or dismiss workers, etc., and workers rarely requested wage increases. At the beginning of these disputes, labor and management first negotiated directly, and when they could not reach an agreement and could not resolve the matter, they requested the intervention of the concession authorities. Only a few applied to the Special District Court.

### Citizens' Associations in Various Districts Request Dispersal of Bus and Tram Stops

Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road Area

Concentrated Stations Hinder Traffic

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, 15th, 18th, 27th, 31st, 32nd, 34th, 35th, 36th, 37th and other district branch associations, yesterday jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Federation saying: “We are writing to inform you that our members have repeatedly stated that the area around Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road is the center of the Public Settlement, and pedestrian traffic has always been extremely congested. Moreover, due to the sharp increase in residents within the boundary, the degree of congestion is even worse today. Not only does it hinder traffic, but it is also easy for unfortunate incidents to occur. In the past, petty thieves took the opportunity to commit crimes, which was commonplace. Future dangers are even more unpredictable. The reason is that tram stops are too concentrated, which is the main cause. At the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, there are tram stops for routes 1, 2, 7, etc. on the east and west sides, and tram stops for routes 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, etc. on the north and south sides. A few steps to the east is a bus stop. With so many vehicles and passengers getting on and off, it is extremely crowded. The ease with which accidents can occur is to be expected. In order to maintain law and order and improve the appearance of the city, it is necessary to relocate the tram stops there. Our members suggest that the tram stop on the east side of that location should be moved slightly westward, and that the bus stop for buses traveling from west to east should be located to the east of Sanyang South Goods Store, and also slightly moved to the west, separately located west of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road, dispersing the passengers getting on and off the trams and buses, so that the traffic at the busy intersection will not be blocked, and law and order will be easier to maintain. We are sending this letter to your association and ask you to forward it to the Municipal Council and the tram company and the bus company for negotiation in order to implement it." After checking the above-mentioned points, the association deems that this is indeed the most effective way to disperse pedestrians. The parking places for public vehicles should not be close to overly busy crossroads. Currently, most bus stops are leaving the traffic intersections and being set up separately, and the westward relocation of the tram stop at the west end of Yu Qiaqing Road is clear evidence of this. Because it concerns the safety of citizens, we are hereby sending this letter and asking you to quickly forward it to the Municipal Council and the tram company and the bus company for separate consultation and implementation. It would be beneficial to the public.

### Documents That Have Been Omitted to Be Stamped Should Still Be Punished According to Regulations

Chambers of Commerce in Various Places Request Exemption from Penalties

Because It Concerns Tax Revenue, It Is Difficult to Comply

The Ministry of Finance has stated that it has recently received requests from chambers of commerce in various places because various industries have requested exemptions from penalties for documents that have been omitted to be stamped, given the newly revised stamp tax penalties. The ministry believes that because this concerns tax revenue and affects laws and regulations, it is difficult to exempt penalties and has ordered compliance.

### Federation of Women's Organizations Holds Anti-Spitting Campaign

Publicity Week Begins on the 26th of This Month

Obtained Support and Cooperation from the Authorities of Both Settlements

The Shanghai Federation of Women's Organizations believes that spitting everywhere easily transmits diseases and affects public health. This bad habit should be effectively corrected. It has initiated an "Anti-Spitting Campaign," led by Mrs. Ba Yuehan, Chairman of the Public Welfare Committee of the association, and preparations have been very active in recent days.

### Passports via Vietnam Can Also Be Signed in Shanghai

China Travel Service Handling

Those traveling from Shanghai to the southwest inland via Haiphong, Vietnam, must apply for a passport in Xi'an. The Consular Visa Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, in view of the increasing number of Chinese citizens traveling to Kunming via Vietnam, agreed to issue passports, but applicants must have a reputable guarantor in Hong Kong, and must have three 4-inch photos and 9 Hong Kong dollars. After three days, they can obtain a passport, which must be approved by the French Consul in Hong Kong before they can purchase a ticket and depart. However, those traveling from this city often feel difficult about the formalities of obtaining a visa because they are unfamiliar with the people and places in Hong Kong. It is now known that the China Travel Service in this city can handle the application for customers and apply directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing. In addition to the 4-inch photos, the passport fee is 8 yuan, but it takes time to travel back and forth, so it can only be obtained after three weeks. After the traveler obtains the passport, it must still be approved by the French Consul in Shanghai before they can purchase a ticket and depart. Currently, the only transportation lines from this city to various places in the southwest are Zhejiang East and Haiphong, so more and more people are detouring through Haiphong. After the implementation of these handling procedures, everyone says that it is much more convenient.
