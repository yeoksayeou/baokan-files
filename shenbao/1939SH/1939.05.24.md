### League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting: Gu Weijun Urges Member States to Expand Economic Aid to China, Requests Embargo on War Materials and Restraint of Japanese Aggression, Suggests Formation of Adjustment Committee, Opposed by Britain and France

(Geneva) Yesterday, during the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, China's chief representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, delivered a passionate speech, urging member states of the League of Nations to continue providing financial and material assistance to China, and to prohibit the shipment of war materials to Japan. Following Gu's speech, only British Foreign Secretary Halifax and New Zealand's Special Commissioner to London, Jordan, spoke. Halifax expressed sympathy for the Chinese people, but stated that the British government found it difficult to endorse the broad scope of the proposals put forward by the Chinese representative. The New Zealand representative wholeheartedly supported China's appeal and announced his endorsement of Gu's suggestions. The meeting was then adjourned to allow Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, ample time to consult with his colleagues. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Geneva) Representatives of the member states of the League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting this morning to exchange views on the application submitted by China's representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, and to strive to draft a resolution that would be acceptable to the Chinese representative while not exceeding the scope defined by British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in their speeches yesterday. The Administrative Council is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting at 4 p.m. this afternoon, followed by a public meeting. (Havas, 23rd)

### Two Demands Made

In his appeal, Gu Weijun put forward the following two demands: (1) That member states of the League of Nations provide China with financial and material assistance to strengthen its resistance war and aid its refugees, and to prevent any events that would weaken China's resistance war. They should no longer allow the supply of war materials and raw materials necessary for continued aggression, such as airplanes and gasoline, to Japan, and should restrict the import of goods. (2) That a body be established to adjust the measures already taken or to be taken regarding the above items.

### Statement on the Sino-Japanese War Situation

Gu also stated that China, determined to resist Japan, spared no effort in using all its stored weapons and exhausting its manpower and economic resources. It is currently at the forefront of the world's peace front. If China had succumbed to Japan's threats from the beginning, or stopped resisting aggression, and accepted Japanese control, then it is not necessary for thoughtful people to imagine the impact on the current tense situation in Europe and the interests of democratic countries in the Far East. Gu then briefly described the war situation, stating that since China abandoned positional warfare and switched to mobile warfare, it has deprived the invading forces of fixed targets for concentrated attacks and left them at a loss as to where to inflict a devastating blow on the Chinese army. The new strategy has helped the Chinese army regain significant initiative and enabled it to attack the enemy simultaneously at various points. Gu also pointed out that the Japanese army had attempted to cut off China's two major overseas supply lines but ultimately failed to achieve its goals. Gu praised the actions of American aircraft factories, stating that they had complied with the US government's advice in July of last year not to sell airplanes to Japan, thus halting their exports.

### British and French Foreign Ministers Speak Subsequently: Sympathy for China's Brave Resistance

British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax responded to Dr. Gu's appeal, saying: "The distinguished representative of China, with his eloquent tongue, has appealed on behalf of his country's resistance war. I believe his words have once again stirred in all of us a surge of emotion for the terrible suffering of the Chinese people. Moreover, they have made us all admire the steadfast courage displayed by the Chinese people in enduring suffering. For more than two years now, the world has been forced to witness the spectacle of battle, in which the entire nation of China has been subjected to the means of a new era of warfare by one of its neighbors, whose ultimate interests everyone believed should be used to cultivate friendship and goodwill. The resistance of the Chinese people has aroused deep and widespread sympathy, and the British government fully shares this sympathy."

### Proposal to Establish an Adjustment Committee: The Two Countries Are Not Inclined to Endorse It

The British government's inability to support the suggestions recently put forward by Dr. Gu on behalf of China is not due to a lack of sympathy, nor should it be regarded as a departure from the policy established for member states in the various resolutions passed by the League of Nations regarding the Far Eastern war. The British government has never hesitated in its desire to use all its power and take advantage of every opportunity to achieve a just resolution of the war. The British government remains acutely aware of the task stipulated in the resolution of October 6, 1937, which is to consider the extent to which individual countries can assist China. As a member state, the British government acknowledges this obligation and does not wish to evade it. It has refused to close the roads passing through British territory into China and has facilitated the opening of new roads. The British government has adopted a certain financial plan, which I need not elaborate on. The British government hopes that although some of these plans were initially implemented to protect British interests, they will prove helpful to China's current difficulties, which the Chinese government also acknowledges. The British government will certainly continue to consider the needs of the Chinese people and the obligations arising from previous League of Nations resolutions. The Chinese representative recently suggested that a small committee be formed by member states with special ties to the Far East to investigate plans under Article 16 of the League Covenant (which stipulates sanctions). A similar plan was also put forward during the previous meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Although the principle of investigative action was acknowledged at that meeting, it has so far been felt that the necessary factors for this adjustment are not assured. Halifax then asked the representatives of the countries participating in this meeting whether they felt that there had been any changes in the situation in this regard since the last Administrative Council meeting and whether they believed that the factors in question had now been felt and could be guaranteed. Halifax continued that it seemed to him that all the countries most directly involved in this matter must admit that this was not the case, and therefore, in this situation and when they now bear major responsibilities elsewhere in the world, it would be insincere if the British government could assume the hope of the constraints added in Dr. Gu's proposals. Halifax also stated that the British government believed that other governments that were members of the League of Nations seemed to feel that they were in the same position, so the British government had to have serious doubts about whether adopting the current proposal to establish an adjustment committee would be effective. (Reuters, 23rd)

French Foreign Minister Bonnet stated that he was deeply saddened to hear of the bombing of ordinary Chinese people. The League of Nations General Assembly had also passed a resolution condemning such warfare, which is still in effect. I now call on all countries to assist China separately to the best of their ability to cope with this terrible ordeal. As far as France is concerned, it has decided to strictly implement the various resolutions of the League of Nations. As for the proposal to establish an adjustment committee, the situation is the same as it was in January of this year, and it is not convenient to support it.

### Representatives of the Soviet Union, New Zealand, and Bolivia Unreservedly Support China's Demands

In addition, New Zealand representative Jordan unreservedly endorsed all the requests made by Ambassador Gu, and said that the United States is now trying to ban the sale of military supplies to Japan, which can serve as an example. Bolivian representative Costa du Rels said that the various requests made by Ambassador Gu could have a good influence on the international situation, and I am prepared to support them. Administrative Council Chairman Maisky also endorsed China's demands on behalf of the Soviet Union, saying that international anarchy must be stopped, and the only way to do so is to help the invaded country. Since Britain has this attitude towards the situation in Europe, China, which has been invaded, is the key to the world situation, and its demands should be endorsed by all countries and then assisted. At this point, Dr. Gu Weijun said that he was very grateful for the earnest expressions of views by the representatives of the various countries and reserved the right to take future steps. (Havas, 23rd)

### Albanian King's Appeal Telegram: Not Discussed by the League of Nations; Fortification of the Aaland Islands: Belgian Representative Appointed to Draft Report

(Geneva) At this morning's closed-door meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, China's representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, requested that China's application be discussed earlier, without waiting until the closing of the Administrative Council meeting. All the council members agreed. As a result, it was decided to list China's application as the first item for discussion at the afternoon's general meeting. The decision was made to immediately discuss the telegram of appeal sent to the League of Nations Administrative Council last week by the King of Albania. A certain important council member argued that the telegram should be shelved and not discussed, but Representative Gu and Soviet Representative Maisky both objected. Representative Gu stated that although China and Albania were not related, Albania was also a member state of the League of Nations, so the Albanian issue involved the principles of the League Covenant and international law and could endanger the existence of the League of Nations. It is heard that the Administrative Council has decided to transfer the Albanian case to the next General Assembly for discussion. At the general meeting this afternoon, Gu Weijun delivered a speech, which was not discussed thereafter. Gu is scheduled to meet with Halifax and Bonnet before the British and French representatives return home tomorrow to exchange views. (23rd)

(Geneva) In addition to discussing the requests made by China, the Administrative Council's public meeting also submitted the questions of Palestine and the fortification of the Baltic Aaland Islands for study. Regarding the question of Palestine, British Foreign Secretary declared that the White Paper recently published by the British government had not yet been discussed by Parliament and that the League of Nations should not immediately submit it for discussion. French Foreign Minister Bonnet stated that the United Kingdom had already made many efforts on this issue. Latvian Foreign Minister and League of Nations Mandates Commission Reporter Mundters then stated that the Commission would hold a meeting next month to discuss the matter. Regarding the fortification of the Aaland Islands, Finnish Foreign Minister Holsti and Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler spoke successively, stating that their respective countries had reached an agreement on the matter and that the fortification plan they had agreed upon was limited and would not hinder the international legal basis of 1921 (this legal basis was signed by Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Britain, France, and Italy). At this point, Latvian representative Mundters and Belgian representative Komarnicki expressed their approval. The Administrative Council then appointed Belgian representative Bourquin as the reporter and asked him to submit a report at the next meeting. (Havas, 22nd)

### Danzig and the League of Nations: Current Relationship; Decision by the Three-Nation Committee: No Plans to Change Temporarily

(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council's "Committee on the Free City of Danzig," which is composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Sweden, held a meeting this morning and, after obtaining the consent of the Polish government, resolved to temporarily not change the current legal status of the city of Danzig, and requested the League of Nations High Commissioner to that city, Burckhardt (currently in Geneva), to return to his post as soon as possible to submit a report on the city's situation. (Havas, 22nd)

### British and French Foreign Ministers Leave Geneva

(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with French Foreign Minister Bonnet this morning to conduct talks and is scheduled to return to London tonight. It is also possible that Foreign Minister Bonnet will return to Paris tonight. (Havas, 23rd)

### Foreign Minister Wang Broadcasts to the United States

(Chongqing) The China Branch of the World Anti-Aggression League recently held its second annual meeting of the National Representative Assembly and urged Foreign Minister Wang to broadcast in English to the United States on the 23rd, titled "Prospects for China's Resistance War," stating that the Japanese warlords' original dream of a quick victory had failed, and that China was getting closer to victory the more it fought. Japan has been expending its troops and resources for 22 months, and the Chinese land it has occupied is scattered everywhere, like isolated islands in the sea, making it impossible to sustain. Our country is focusing on internal economic development, and the future is extremely bright. The countries that previously had major interests in the Far East have missed the opportunity due to procrastination and waiting, allowing Japan to run rampant. However, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. They should quickly assist China in sanctioning Japan and cutting off all supplies of resources to Japan. (23rd)

Editorial

### High Hopes for Geneva

The 105th regular meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened the day before yesterday. We once stated our expectations for this meeting. News came that Chinese representative Ambassador Gu Weijun had put forward two requests for China's resistance war against Japan: First, the member states of the League of Nations should expand financial assistance to China and should no longer supply Japan with war materials, such as airplanes and gasoline; second, the Administrative Council should organize a general committee to adjust assistance methods. Measuring these requests against the fundamental principles of the League of Nations, the explicit provisions of the Covenant, and China's unfortunate circumstances, it can be said that even if all the requests were fully granted, they would be very modest. Yet Gu's requests were still met with difficulties. Truly, those who deeply love the League of Nations cannot help but despise it!

News reports of the speeches of representatives from various countries are vague. Those who supported China's requests included New Zealand representative Jordan, Bolivian representative Costa du Rels, and Soviet Ambassador Maisky. However, British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet both said that the second request had been discussed during the previous meeting in January. They stated that the timing was unfavorable and that the current situation was still the same, so there was no reason to adopt it. Such opposition is still the same argument as in January. The matter was not decided, and Ambassador Maisky, in his capacity as chairman of the meeting, announced that he would consult the opinions of the representatives of the member states of the Administrative Council and then discuss it again. How this will turn out is unpredictable. We can only wait and see how the facts develop. As for the first request, the British representative expressed "assistance in all aspects," and the French representative expressed "separate assistance to China to the best of its ability, and France will strictly implement the various resolutions of the League of Nations." These are practical matters, not empty words. Since China has repeatedly appealed and Britain and France have repeatedly expressed sympathy, how will the actual assistance after this meeting be better than in the past, so as to meet the urgency of China's repeated requests, so as to show the sincerity of Britain and France in accepting again, and also so as to see whether the League of Nations is ultimately a mere facade?

The international sense of justice and collective action are truly difficult to express. For example, Britain and France are geographically one, with navigable waterways, and are truly as close as lips and teeth. In World War I, the two countries shared hardships. In the League of Nations, the two countries often echo each other. However, the sincere and frank exchange of views, vowing to support each other and share weal and woe, was still a matter after the Czech issue was made last September, and after the Munich Agreement was signed, the hope of appeasing the European situation was disappointed. Also, for example, Britain and the Soviet Union share the same concerns and troubles, and they are both harmed if they are divided, and they both benefit if they are united. However, negotiations to conclude a mutual assistance agreement have been going on for months, and it was only yesterday that news of a harmonious agreement came. Britain and France are like this, Britain and the Soviet Union are like this, and two or three countries are still like this, let alone the League of Nations with more than fifty countries! Therefore, all the resolutions and measures of the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese issue, although criticized by those who sympathize with China, it is not possible to immediately blame the League of Nations for deliberately being cold. And those who have expectations for the League of Nations can only compare it to the tortuous and winding path of unity between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, give it time to develop, and see the mutual sharing of interests and harms, and then things will fall into place. Moreover, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the core of the League of Nations. The League of Nations can only take action after the unity of the three countries, and it cannot be forced at first.

Speaking of today, although it is too early to expect the League of Nations to take any effective collective action for China as an organization, the League of Nations is not an international decoration, and the regular meeting is not a decoration of the League of Nations. Therefore, whether the League of Nations and the regular meeting are disgraced depends on what effective individual actions Britain, France, and the Soviet Union take. The sum of the power of the three countries is not something that any one country can match. Even if Germany, Italy, and Japan are in cahoots, they are still dwarfed. Therefore, although the League of Nations cannot take action immediately, if the three countries are sincere, exert their best efforts, and act in parallel, they will certainly become an important factor in improving the situation in the Far East. Moreover, the impact is not limited to this. Since the League of Nations is the scope, and there are more than fifty member states, there are many who follow the lead of Britain and France alone. If Britain and France take action, then other countries will respond with individual actions one after another. Outside the scope of the League of Nations, the United States is happy to move forward in parallel and does not need any constraints and is bound to be influenced by the situation. But if Britain and France hesitate and look around, why should other countries hesitate and waver? It is hoped that the current meeting of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations will rise to the occasion. Otherwise, it is also hoped that the representatives of the various countries will take advantage of the convenience of meeting in Geneva to be sincere, exert their best efforts, and take action outside the meeting.

### Another Victory in Northern Hubei: Chinese Army Captures Suixian City; Japanese Troops Attacking Xinqiang River Retreat to Yueyang: Northern Hunan War Enters a State of Calm; Guerrillas Active in Western Nanchang

A certain unit that recovered Zaoyang and pursued the Japanese army approached the outskirts of Suixian City on the evening of the 22nd and engaged in a fierce battle all night. The Japanese initially closed the city to resist stubbornly, but after being bravely attacked by the Chinese army, they were finally unable to withstand it and fled.

British Labour MP Questions Shanghai and Xiamen Incidents, Britain Hopes Japan Will Quickly Withdraw Troops from Gulangyu, Shanghai Concession System Must Not Be Changed

London At last night's House of Commons session, Labour MP Henderson raised questions about the situation in the Shanghai and Xiamen International Settlements. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that the landing of British, American, and French sailors in the Xiamen International Settlement was aimed at enabling the Gulangyu Municipal Council to restore its sovereignty as soon as possible. The troops of all countries will withdraw gradually along with the reduction of the Japanese landing forces. The Japanese government has responded to the representations made by the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, regarding the Xiamen International Settlement incident, stating that the landing of the Japanese marines was a necessary measure, but since most of the purpose of these troops has been achieved, they have been gradually withdrawing. The British Ambassador has expressed to the Japanese side his earnest hope that this withdrawal will be carried out quickly. Regarding Shanghai, Butler said that the Japanese government recently made proposals to revise the land regulations and the organization of Chinese courts within the International Settlement. British Ambassador Craigie has replied to the Japanese government, stating that while the British government is prepared to negotiate with other relevant countries regarding any necessary revisions, the situation in the Shanghai area is still far from returning to normal, and initiating any negotiations at this time is unlikely to be successful. Therefore, it is believed that this issue should be resolved only when the situation has developed to a more stable state. The Ambassador also informed the Japanese side that the above observations apply equally to the Chinese courts within the International Settlement, as they were established under multilateral agreements. Butler continued that he had heard that the US government had also made a similar reply. At this point, Henderson raised a supplementary question, asking whether the Japanese requests for increased Japanese control within the Shanghai and Xiamen International Settlements had been accepted or rejected. Butler replied that they were currently awaiting the final reply from the Japanese government. (23rd Reuters dispatch)

Xiamen Japanese Consul Actually Lodges Protest

Tokyo According to an announcement made here today, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, Ushida Goro, yesterday lodged a protest with the consular body managing the Gulangyu International Settlement regarding the landing of British, American, and French naval forces on Gulangyu. It is claimed that Japan had requested that the three countries' naval forces not land and had guaranteed that the Japanese troops would also withdraw after the assassination of Hong Lixun, the pro-Japanese chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, was thoroughly investigated. However, the fact that Britain, America, and France still dispatched troops to land is a "hostile and incomprehensible act." (23rd Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Xiamen The Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, Uchida, in replying on May 23rd to the note issued by the foreign consular corps on May 19th, referred to the landing of British, American, and French sailors on Gulangyu as an unfriendly act. The reply stated that the Japanese request to appoint Japanese personnel to responsible positions in the settlement's administration and police force was aimed at adapting to the new situation in Xiamen and maintaining peace and prosperity on Gulangyu. The Japanese side had requested the British, American, and French authorities to cease the troop landings, with the understanding that the Japanese soldiers landing to search for the assassins of Hong Lixun would be completely withdrawn within a few days. However, Britain, America, and France disregarded the Japanese request and dispatched sailors to land, which is an unfriendly act and incomprehensible. (23rd Reuters dispatch)

Japanese Side Makes New Demands on Tianjin British Municipal Council, Rumors that Puppet Government Plans to Take Over All Concessions, Several Measures Already Decided by Japanese Side

Beiping According to an official statement made by the Japanese side today and reported in Japanese newspapers, Japan may take advantage of the fact that the United States has no concession in Tianjin and attempt to occupy all foreign concessions in Tianjin in the near future. According to the Allied News Agency here, "The Japanese authorities believe that it is necessary to thoroughly resolve the issue of the foreign concessions in Tianjin, not only because the concessions have not cooperated with the Japanese side in suppressing terrorists, but also because they are conspiring to disrupt the economic and political situation in North China." The report even referred to the concessions as "anti-Japanese black dens" in North China. The British and French authorities in the area should recognize the new situation in North China under Japanese rule. It also stated that the only solution to this problem is for the Beiping authorities under Japanese rule to take back the concessions or for the Japanese side to manage them. It seems difficult to avoid frictions that may arise from this move. According to the Tianjin Yong Bao, Japan has decided on one of the following measures to deal with the foreign concessions: 1. Completely block their transportation to the outside world; 2. Return the concessions to the "Beiping government"; 3. Completely manage them by the Japanese side; 4. Rebuild and prosper the former German concession area into a new city, causing other concessions to become desolate. A Japanese spokesman said regarding this report that he considered this news "inevitably premature," but could not deny it. After making this statement, the Japanese spokesman participated in a meeting at the Japanese Command Headquarters here for several hours. After the meeting, he issued the following declaration: "I cannot deny or confirm this report. The Japanese Army Command in North China has no formal relationship with this report, but the commanding officers did not endorse this report. (23rd Associated Press dispatch)

Beiping According to a Chinese newspaper report, the Japanese authorities have made new demands on the Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council, including the following three items: 1. The Municipal Council should hire a Japanese advisor; 2. British police should conduct searches for terrorists jointly with Japanese military police; 3. All captured terrorists should be handed over to the Japanese side. The report also stated that the Japanese authorities are currently planning to have the "Provisional Government" take over the Tianjin concessions, or have the Municipal Council managed by the Japanese authorities, and surround the concessions to reduce their importance. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

Beiping According to a Chinese newspaper report, the French Consul-General in Tianjin issued a notice prohibiting political activities or gatherings in the French Concession. Anyone whose actions endanger the peace and order of the concession will be expelled from the concession or handed over to the Chinese Public Security Bureau.

Japanese Side Tries Hard to Monopolize Shipping Industry

Hong Kong The Japanese side is attempting to monopolize the shipping industry in China, obstructing ships of third countries, arbitrarily inspecting them, and illegally detaining them. Since January of this year, the shipping industry of various countries to China has declined sharply, while Japan has jumped to the first place. The Japanese side has recently announced that it will prevent ships of third countries from leaving coastal inland ports, stating that from June 1st, customs declarations will not be allowed to the Jianghai Customs without the prior permission of the Japanese Navy. The so-called coastal inland ports refer to Haimen, Qidong, and Zaoning in Jiangsu, Haimen in Zhejiang, and Xinghua and Quanzhou in Fujian. (21st dispatch)

League of Nations External Activities, Anti-Aggression Talks Progress, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Sign Mutual Defense Agreement, Still Awaiting Final Decision by the British Cabinet

Geneva After French Foreign Minister Bonnet held talks with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and British Foreign Secretary Halifax respectively, well-informed sources here declared that all difficulties in the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union to organize an anti-aggression group have been resolved, and there is no longer any risk of failure in the current negotiations. When the British Cabinet holds a cabinet meeting on the 24th of this month, it will make a decision on the signing of a mutual defense agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. When Ambassador Maisky spoke with Foreign Minister Bonnet, he explained in detail the difficulties in establishing an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Bonnet was very satisfied upon hearing this. Afterward, he also met with Foreign Secretary Halifax, and they both believed that the points of consultation between Britain and the Soviet Union had now been completely eliminated. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax was also well aware of the reasons why Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should immediately establish a mutual defense agreement. (22nd Havas dispatch)

London Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have indeed made progress and will soon be completed. It is expected to be submitted to the cabinet for review and decision in the next two days, and on the afternoon of the 24th of this month or the afternoon of the 25th, before the parliamentary recess for Pentecost, Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce it to the House of Commons. After the event, the Prime Minister will go to Edinburgh, Scotland, for a rest and return to London on the evening of the 26th. According to sources close to the government, Britain and the Soviet Union must conclude a mutual assistance treaty. This principle has long been recognized by Britain. The only remaining difficulty is that the special status of certain countries should be fully considered. Generally speaking, the British government may present a note to the Soviet government on the 24th of this month, confirming that the two countries have reached complete agreement on establishing an agreement, and Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce it in the House of Commons. As for the disputes caused by the political and military treaties of Germany and Italy and the Free City of Danzig, people here do not attach much importance to them, but they say that since Italy's attitude is very clear, it is necessary for Britain and the Soviet Union to establish an agreement as soon as possible. In addition, Japan is very unwilling to join the German-Italian alliance. Since the agreement that Britain and the Soviet Union are about to sign does not include the Far East, that country has no reason to change its attitude. (22nd Havas dispatch)

Paris Regarding the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on the organization of an anti-aggression group, French Foreign Minister Bonnet recently made a statement to the Paris Evening News correspondent stationed in Geneva, saying, "After long talks with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, I am convinced that these negotiations will be completed. France and the Soviet Union are already bound by the mutual assistance agreement of 1935. Once the British-Soviet agreement is established, France's security organization will be more complete, and the maintenance of peace will also be greatly benefited." The Paris Evening News correspondent added a commentary, saying, "Foreign Minister Bonnet has always been known for his prudence, and now he has issued such an optimistic statement, which is enough to know that the British-Soviet negotiations will be successful."

Berlin Watches Closely

Berlin Regarding the current negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union on the organization of an anti-aggression group, the Berlin Post Newspaper recently commented that it is rumored that these negotiations have involved Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, that is, the implementation of economic and military sanctions. If this is the case, then the neutral status of the small countries will be affected, and the relationship with the Axis countries will be more subtle. As far as Germany is concerned, the importance of sanctions has long been lost. If certain countries ignore the mutual relations between Germany and the small countries, and use the League of Nations Covenant to promote their encirclement policy and make it legally based, and force the small countries to violate their neutral status, then Germany may re-consider its mutual relations with regard to the crises caused by these small countries being manipulated by the three major member states of the League of Nations (referring to Britain, France, and the Soviet Union).

Situation in Danzig Remains Tense, Germany Blames Anglo-Polish Pact

Warsaw Regarding the anti-Polish incident in the town of Karlshof in the Free City of Danzig, officials here recently stated that the Senate of the Free City has submitted a reply to the Polish High Commissioner Chodacki, stating that it has decided on measures to protect the safety of Polish customs officials and allow them to perform their duties. At the same time, Polish government officials also stated that this dispute will not have a significant impact on the mutual relations between Germany and Poland, and between Poland and the Free City of Danzig, but the situation remains extremely tense. (22nd Havas report)

Berlin Since the incident in Karlshof, Danzig, German newspapers have remained silent and have not commented on it. However, "German Foreign Policy News," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, criticized the Polish government with sharp words, saying that the incident was the result of the Anglo-Polish pact. It expressed outrage that Britain and France reprinted the Polish side's announcement of the incident, believing that Gruber, who was killed, was a "troublemaker." The newspaper declared that the Karlshof incident made Germany understand that the purpose of the Anglo-Polish pact was to instigate Polish militarism. (23rd Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Danzig The Danzig City Council issued a public statement today, stating, "The current system of this city was forcibly formulated by the Treaty of Versailles and cannot be maintained for long.

The fact that it sends personnel to manage the city's customs is one aspect of this. These customs officials should be dismissed. (22nd Havas dispatch)

Japan Refuses to Participate in German-Italian Military Alliance, Does Not Want to Isolate Itself from Democratic Countries, London People Have Long Heard of It

London According to reports from Tokyo, Japan's disregard for joining the Axis military agreement has dispelled the unease caused by the formal signing of the German-Italian military agreement in European countries. The Axis countries' inability to get Japan to join the military agreement means that Japan refuses to risk going to war with the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. It is understood that Japan's new policy includes intensifying military measures against the Soviet Union, but it has nothing to do with other European countries. The British diplomatic community is deeply afraid that Japan may change its policy, or that extreme elements in the military who support an alliance with Germany and Italy may suddenly arise. However, the British side firmly believes that the exclusion of the Far East from the Anglo-Soviet agreement is the reason why Japan did not participate in Berlin's anti-British plan. (23rd Associated Press dispatch)

London It is expected in official circles here that although those who advocate joining the German-Italian military alliance in Japan are quite powerful, Japan will definitely refuse to participate in this alliance. The Tokyo correspondent of the Daily Telegraph said that those who oppose concluding an alliance with Germany and Italy and advocate returning to the friendly circle of democratic countries are working behind the scenes every day. Most of them are very important figures in Japan, and there are those who occupy important military positions in the army and navy, but their strength is not enough to promote a sudden change. If this policy of opposing an alliance with Germany and Italy and advocating returning to friendship with democratic countries is implemented, it will also be done in a cautious and gradual manner.

Japanese Young Officers Advocate Anti-British Sentiment

Tokyo According to former National Assembly member Nakano, a Japanese fascist, Japan must immediately conclude a military agreement with Germany and Italy to deal with the situation in the Far East. Nakano once said in Shanghai that Japan should make Britain surrender. Nakano has a high reputation among young Japanese soldiers, but is not popular in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because Nakano believes that Japan's apology to the United States for sinking the American warship "Panay" was a "national disgrace." He declared yesterday that this is not the time to discuss military agreements with other countries participating in the anti-communist pact. We must take action immediately without considering the feelings of other countries. Nakano recently resigned from the Japanese National Assembly in order to be able to publish his anti-foreign remarks in Shanghai. He condemned the attitudes of various democratic countries towards Japan. He said that Japan should unite with Germany and Italy, because these two countries have close friendly relations with Japan. He further said that since Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the anti-communist pact, their feelings have been harmonious. If they can further unite and conclude a military agreement, it will maintain the balance of power between all countries in the world and guarantee peace in the Far East and other parts of the world. Nakano also mentioned that since Japan invaded Manchuria, the major powers of the world have condemned Japan as an aggressor and interfered in Japan's affairs in China in various ways. He said that Japan should not hesitate to join the German-Italian military agreement to deal with these countries. He concluded that when we think of the way these countries treated Japan in the past, and compare it with the friendship and support given to Japan by Germany and Italy, we should not hesitate to conclude a military agreement with the Axis countries.

German-Italian Alliance Pact Has Offensive Nature, Economic Problems in Wartime Still Have Many Serious Defects

Berlin The German-Italian alliance treaty was recently commented on by National Socialist Party members, who all said that the treaty is dynamic and offensive in nature. However, political figures said that its nature is extremely strong, unlike the alliances concluded by various democratic countries. Germany and Italy will immediately form a joint committee to deal with military and economic issues in peacetime and wartime. In terms of military affairs, the two countries have long exchanged secrets of manufacturing military equipment, as well as various materials and technical personnel. The focus of future research is the wartime economy, which is the weakness of the German-Italian axis. Suddenly, the scope of activities of Germany and Italy is still limited, and they have not been able to gain access to the world's major transportation lines. They are eager to win over Spain in the hope of establishing a German-Italian-Spanish military alliance so that they can gain access to the Atlantic Ocean. From Germany's perspective, this is more important than the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. However, after the establishment of the German-Italian alliance treaty, Spanish National Army Commander-in-Chief Franco has not yet sent a congratulatory telegram, which has surprised the German side. Foreign observers here say that although Germany and Italy do not lack food, they lack various raw materials, mineral oil, fats, textile raw materials, and rubber. It can be seen that there are still many serious shortcomings in the economy. (23rd Havas dispatch)

Rome Celebrates

Rome After the signing of the German-Italian political and military treaty, the Fascist professional groups and the Senate held a joint meeting this afternoon to celebrate, and many members gave speeches, saying that "the ties between Germany and Italy are indelible, and the two nations will defend their rights related to survival." In addition, many members of the Fascist Party held a gathering in front of the Venice Palace, the Prime Minister's residence, to celebrate, cheering and paying tribute to Prime Minister Mussolini. (22nd Havas dispatch)

Gaita, the editor-in-chief of the Roman newspaper "Italian News," published an article in the newspaper last night, commenting on the German-Italian alliance. His words roughly stated that "From now on, the national defense forces of Germany and Italy can be combined into one and be dispatched by military experts from Germany and Italy. The military strength of the armies of Germany and Italy far surpasses that of other countries, and it would take several more years of preparation to match them. The decisive factors in war are the courage and number of soldiers. Germany and Italy have these conditions, as well as common ideals and substantial military preparations. As far as Italy's arms production is concerned, its production in 1940 will be four times higher than this year. As far as mechanical industry is concerned, the world must recognize Germany as the first. Since Germany annexed Bohemia and Moravia, its military strength has increased by as many as 40 divisions and is under unified command, so the defensive military forces of Germany and Italy can be victorious. From a political point of view, after the conclusion of the alliance between Germany and Italy, the political power of the two countries since the revolution can be established, and their position in Europe can be enhanced, and their influence will extend overseas. Germany and Italy will respect each other's living space in the future. Germany will always respect Italy's interests in Southeast Europe, the Mediterranean, and Africa, to dispel rumors that Italy's position there has been restricted by Germany. In fact, there will be no joint management of the living space of Germany and Italy. It should be known that the desire for cooperation between Germany and Italy lies only in respecting each other's autonomy and independence and jointly seeking economic development." (23rd Huitong)

Japan's War of Aggression Against China Increasingly Trapped in Difficulties, Economy Exhausting All Resources, People Strictly Implementing Consumption Savings, Controlling Raw Materials and Increasing Production

Tokyo It is generally expected that Japan's consumption of various items for clothing, food, and housing will be reduced to the absolute minimum, and the people will be forced to restrain luxury, entertainment, marriage, and funeral expenses. It is generally expected that the government will soon implement a new law to provide the munitions industry with all possible supplies, expand production capacity, and promote Japan's export business. Currently, the relevant ministries of the government have reached an agreement on the allocation of various important raw materials. The date when the cabinet formally approves the government's plan to mobilize raw materials is not far away. Under the proposed plan, 120 different raw materials will be subject to strict control. These raw materials will be divided into five major categories, namely munitions, industrial expansion, export promotion, government use, and private consumption. At the same time, this raw material mobilization procedure will be closely related to the government's price control policy. The Japanese government is now relying on the cooperation of the whole country to complete this procedure, and attaches great importance to its internal and important relationship with the plan to expand national production and promote Japanese exports, as these two matters are considered prerequisites for successfully resolving the Sino-Japanese war and strengthening national defense. The Ministry of Home Affairs will use the power of its economic police to implement the procedure for distributing food. The number of these police will be increased nationwide, reaching a total of 1,900. Their mission will not be limited to the implementation of control regulations, but will also make the public understand the need for control and its relationship to the Sino-Japanese war, so as to persuade the people to join in cooperation.

Polish Ambassador to Britain Returns Home for Consultations, Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement Should Not Have Any Objections

London Polish Ambassador to Britain Raczynski has been summoned by Foreign Minister Beck of that country to return home for consultations and has already flown back to Warsaw. He will return to his post on the 25th, at which time the ambassador will declare to the British government that the Polish government has no objections to the signing of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. In addition, Foreign Minister Beck will also instruct the ambassador to inform British Foreign Secretary Halifax of the details of the anti-Polish incident that occurred within the Free City of Danzig, so that Britain will understand the facts of the incident and inform them of Poland's moderate attitude. The Polish government also believes that maintaining the independence of Lithuania is necessary for Poland's survival, just as the status of the Free City of Danzig is essential to Poland's survival. All of these points, although it is not hoped that they will be included in the formal declaration of Britain and France (this declaration is to replace the temporary declaration issued by the respective countries guaranteeing Poland, and its wording and meaning are being discussed by the British, French, and Polish governments), should be mentioned in the appendix. However, this appendix is not necessarily made public. As for the extent to which the Polish government should allow amendments to the current system of the city of Danzig, Ambassador Raczynski will inform the British government after listening to Foreign Minister Beck's instructions.

Although the official meeting has not yet released a public statement, according to well-informed sources, the Yugoslav government recently sent a note to the Romanian Foreign Minister, the current chairman of the Standing Committee of the Balkan Entente, pointing out that the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish pact violated the neutral policy of the Balkan Entente. Therefore, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu used this meeting to respond to and explain this matter to the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, and at the same time proposed a planned new alliance in Southeast Europe. The purpose of the plan is said to include Bulgaria and Albania, so its scope will be wider than the Balkan Entente. It is reported that Yugoslavia has expressed great interest in this plan.

British House of Commons Debates Palestine Issue, Colonial Secretary Defends White Paper, Labour Party Says it Violates Trusteeship Principles

London Colonial Secretary MacDonald began a long speech in the House of Commons today at the beginning of the debate on the Palestine issue, stating that in the 1917 Balfour Declaration, British Foreign Secretary Balfour promised to do his utmost to enable the Jews to establish their national home in Palestine. It is said that this promise is indeed the interpretation that Palestine should become a Jewish state. The possibility of a Jewish state is indeed not impossible. In 1917, Lloyd George was Prime Minister when he spoke for the Jews. However, although the drafters of the Balfour Declaration had the implication that a Jewish state could be established, they did not explicitly say that a Jewish state could be established. What they said was uncertain wording. They did recognize that the large-scale residence of Jews in Palestine was an attempt, the degree of which must be determined by various factors, so the words "national home" were used in the declaration. This word can be interpreted as a Jewish state in Palestine, but it can also be interpreted in other ways. When the Balfour Declaration was issued, there was a saying that its purpose was to give an empty country to a countryless people, but Palestine was not empty. In 1918, there were already 600,000 Arabs living there for thousands of years. The correspondence between McMahon and the Arabs will not be discussed in detail. Let's talk about the more recent promises of the British government. When the government was about to issue the Balfour Declaration, it sent personnel to Jeddah in the Kingdom of Hejaz to declare to the Arab leaders that the British government agreed with the Jews' return

### Intense Fighting Erupts on the Border Between Outer Mongolia and the Puppet Manchuria: Japanese Claim to Have Shot Down Seven Outer Mongolian Aircraft, a Serious Dispute Following the Zhanggufeng Incident

(Tokyo): According to a report received today from "Xinjing," intense fighting is currently taking place between Outer Mongolian and "Manchukuo" troops near Nomunhan (transliteration) on the western "Manchukuo" border with Outer Mongolia. According to Japanese reports, twelve Outer Mongolian aircraft, including light bombers and fighter planes, flew to "Manchukuo" yesterday and strafed "Manchukuo" positions with machine guns. "Manchukuo" aircraft immediately took off to engage them, resulting in the downing of three Outer Mongolian aircraft. The Outer Mongolian aircraft were shot down within "Manchukuo" territory. The scale of the aerial combat is gradually expanding. According to recent Japanese reports received here, aerial combat also took place today, but the results of today's aerial combat have not been released. It is reported that there was contact at that location some days ago, and it is claimed that Outer Mongolian cavalry attempted to attack "Manchukuo" positions on May 20 but were repelled by the "Manchukuo" side. In the two days following, the two sides engaged in fierce fighting. According to Japanese reports, every Outer Mongolian attack was repelled by "Manchukuo" troops, and a total of seven Outer Mongolian aircraft have been shot down in three days. However, the Japanese report did not specify the losses suffered by the "Manchukuo" troops. Currently, the "Manchukuo authorities" have dispatched large units of infantry and air force to the scene of the incident to assist in the fighting. (23rd Associated Press dispatch)

(Changchun): As a result of the shooting down of seven aircraft from Outer Mongolia under Soviet control by Japanese aircraft, relations between the Soviet Union and Japan are in danger of deteriorating sharply. According to Japanese sources, in the three days up to yesterday, seven Outer Mongolian aircraft were shot down by the Japanese in formal aerial combat for flying over "Manchukuo" territory for reconnaissance purposes. It is reported that Japanese aircraft challenged the Outer Mongolian aircraft, shooting down two in the first encounter, two more in the second aerial combat, and three in the third. The third aerial combat is said to have occurred because ten Outer Mongolian aircraft attacked "Manchukuo" bases southwest of Nomunhan (transliteration). The locations of the above three aerial combats were not far apart, and the cause was always the Outer Mongolian aircraft flying over "Manchukuo" territory. It is claimed that the seven aircraft shot down were brought down within the "Manchukuo" border after being engaged by Japanese fighter planes. It is now believed here that the activities of the Outer Mongolian aircraft are the beginning of a more serious development. There is currently anxiety here as to how the overall situation will play out. The incursion of Outer Mongolian aircraft into the "Manchukuo" border is the most serious Soviet-Japanese dispute since the Zhanggufeng incident last year. It is worth noting that the Zhanggufeng incident was the first time the Soviet Union used aircraft to antagonize the Japanese or Japanese-protected territory. At that time, Soviet aircraft attacked important Japanese locations within Korea. Although no Japanese aircraft took off to engage them, they were bombarded by anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese claimed at the time to have shot down several aircraft. Therefore, the current engagement between Japanese aircraft and Outer Mongolian aircraft is the first time the Japanese air force has engaged in combat with aircraft from a country other than China.

### Japanese Troops in Xiamen Land on Gulangyu: The Incident of Hong Lixun's Murder Was Not Committed by the Chinese Side; Nearly Two Hundred Chinese Arrested and Sent to Xiamen; Landing of British and American Troops Calms Residents

A dispatch from Gulangyu from Yulin Bao on May 19 states: Exactly one year ago, U.S. Marines and British sailors landed here to maintain peace on Gulangyu, which was under threat. At that time, it was feared that unscrupulous elements would take advantage of the abnormal situation caused by the Japanese occupation of Xiamen to create chaos. However, in the previous ten days, the Japanese troops began to use a characteristic Japanese method to

Create Chaos

The incident began with the assassination of the "Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce" of Xiamen on May 11. That morning was shrouded in thick fog, and heavy rain poured from dawn. At 10:30 AM, the "Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce," Hong Lixun, went to Xiamen for business. On his return, while passing through a narrow road, he was shot. At that time, there were few pedestrians on the road, and it seemed that no one saw the shooting or even heard the gunshot. By the time others saw him, Hong was lying on the wet road. After being sent to the hospital, it was discovered that the nature of his injuries was quite serious. The bullet entered from his back and exited through his chest. Although Dr. Hallock at the Rescue Hospital did his best to treat him, he died in the early morning of the following day. After the shooting, Japanese troops in Xiamen immediately crossed the harbor, declaring that their nationals were in danger and that Gulangyu was a hotbed of anti-Japanese terrorism. Japanese women and children have been wandering the streets and markets of Gulangyu for months, and others have paid absolutely no attention to them. If, as the Japanese claim, terrorism is rampant, there must have been some slight indication of it. But before this, not even the slightest incident had occurred to Japanese residents or tourists.

The Gulangyu Rifles

Were all taken away by the landing Japanese troops and placed in the leather factory at the far west of the island, with the Japanese flag hanging over the factory. For the first two nights, a curfew was enforced in the west after dark. Chinese residents were forbidden by the Japanese troops to walk on the streets in that area, while Chinese people could pass freely in other parts of the island. After landing, the Japanese troops began a strict search of all Chinese residences in the city, guided by Taiwanese people. The search was mostly carried out based on the directions of the Taiwanese.

Nearly Two Hundred People

Were arrested during this search and sent to Xiamen. It is said that ten of them have already been shot in Xiamen, but eighty have been released to date. However, most of those released were covered in scars and bruises. According to them, they were tortured by Japanese soldiers every night, but few were willing to describe the specific details, fearing that after providing details, they would be re-arrested and suffer harm. At the same time, the Gulangyu Municipal Council protested to the Japanese side about the intrusion of its armed forces into its territory. The Municipal Council understood that the landing of Japanese troops, if provoked, was an unavoidable step, but taking drastic action, allowing them to fly the Japanese flag, confiscating weapons and placing them in the leather factory, and shooting at Chinese troops stationed on the opposite mainland were unnecessary. It questioned the Japanese side about these matters. The Japanese side formally submitted through the Consul-General

Five Demands

If these demands were accepted, it would place the administrative power of the island and the Municipal Council under the actual control of the Japanese side, and diminish all foreign influence. There is no anti-Japanese propaganda or anti-Japanese terrorism on the island, yet they say it must be eradicated. The Municipal Council responded to these demands, but only reiterated its previous protest against the illegal and arbitrary actions of the troops from Xiamen. It is reported that Hong's family received a donation of three thousand yuan from the Pan-Pacific Association, and five hundred yuan in foreign currency from the Xiamen "Chamber of Commerce," to reward Hong for his service to the Japanese troops after their occupation of Xiamen. But since that time, Japanese newspapers have stated that Hong's death was not caused by Chinese terrorists, but by a personal feud. It is said that Hong, as "Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce," and another faction were

Mutually at Odds

But his sudden death obviously created an opportunity for the Japanese troops to land on this island, which is clearly visible. For a week, the city was under strong military control. Anyone wishing to leave the pier had to present a pass. Japanese officers and soldiers were stationed at each pier and landing point to check passes, and even on the streets, passes were checked. Those without a pass were arrested. With the exception of one pier, the others were sealed off and traffic was prohibited. Speculation and fear arose. On Sunday evening, Japanese soldiers began to withdraw. Except for some stationed at the Japanese hospital and protecting the consulate, the rest had returned to Xiamen. On Tuesday, British Admiral North landed here on a flagship. An American ship, several other British ships, and a French ship,

Arrived in Succession

On Thursday (May 18) evening, British sailors and U.S. Marines landed, and residents regained confidence and anxiety also decreased. This small island has returned to tranquility.

### A Reuters Reporter's Travels from Yichang to Xiangyang: The Current Situation in Areas Close to the Front Lines of the Chinese Army; Rumors That Religious Missionaries Are Conducting Relief Efforts as Spies Are Inaccurate

Dispatch from a Reuters Special Correspondent: The speed of transportation in the Chinese interior has temporarily regressed by fifty years due to the war. Aviation, shipping, and transportation companies have already made significant efforts to maintain their operations, but beyond the endpoint of these operations, the traveler's feeling is like that of a pilgrim in the past, hoping to reach his destination but not knowing when or how he can arrive. They proceed according to fate, and cannot predict what they will encounter on their journey. From Yichang to Xiangyang, the Chinese military authorities granted a permit to the reporter to travel by military truck. It is noteworthy that the management of motor transport is now stricter in areas close to the front lines of the Chinese army. Along the way, there is a traffic checkpoint approximately every fifty miles. Here, the driver must present the permits of the people in the truck. This system can not only prevent passengers but also stop past abuses, the most serious of which was that drivers carried various goods and passengers to profit privately. Now, each truck has a military guard carrying a rifle, whose job is to protect the items carried and, more importantly, to prevent soldiers and others from forcibly boarding the truck. At four o'clock one cold morning, we were groping in the dark around a line of trucks on the streets of Yichang. The truck engines were rattling, and we were about to embark for Xiangyang. The vehicles departed immediately. The truck carrying the guard, another Chinese passenger, and the reporter was loaded with coils of electric wire. We tried to get comfortable on them. At daybreak, the heavy rain poured down. We huddled under a torn oilcloth to avoid getting wet, but to no avail. The rainwater dripped onto the reporter's head, and he gradually became wet all over, which made him feel even more uncomfortable. Roads that were quite good when the weather was dry had become muddy. The trucks were skidding surprisingly. Before long, we could no longer drive and stopped outside the small town of Dangyang for the night. The next morning, the driver said that he intended to wait three hours for another line of trucks to arrive. The reporter set out to tour Dangyang, whose scenery was quite monotonous and familiar to the reporter. Within the city walls, all that was visible were broken walls and ruins. Only a few people were seen. They hurried through the city. What was different was that the county government was relatively undamaged, and the county magistrate himself was inside. He apologized to the reporter, first for the dilapidated state of the county government and the entire county, and then briefly informed the reporter about the local situation. It is said that the county was first subjected to a Japanese air raid several months ago, and more than a hundred of the three thousand residents were killed. Afterwards, all movable objects were moved out of the county town. For example, only the frame of the telephone was left for his own use to transmit air raid alerts. The Japanese aircraft carried out two air raids, almost completely destroying the city, but only a few people died. The local authorities are currently managing and organizing the people on a political basis, and educating them about the necessity of resisting the Japanese army and cooperating with the Chinese army. This work has already had encouraging results. The county magistrate also said that he intends to inspect the group of political workers who are working in the area when he has a little spare time. When the reporter returned to the transportation station, he saw that the driver had left. He boarded the next truck, which departed half an hour later. Someone told me when the reporter boarded the truck that we all had to be careful, because the truck was loaded with hand grenades. In this situation, it was hardly necessary to issue this warning. The truck started, driving forward, bumping and slipping on the semi-dry road. Although the driver was quite careful, the flat little boxes in our truck often jumped up and fell back down, making a thumping sound, which made the Chinese passengers in the car look a little uneasy. After the little boxes jumped up a few times, we determined that the hand grenades inside must be very good, so we settled down to enjoy the morning sun and watch for attacking planes. White wild roses were blooming along the roadside, and the fragrance filled the air. The scenery was extremely pleasing. In the evening, we arrived at Xihai Pu (transliteration), where the road connecting Xiangyang and Shashi intersected. The officer in charge of the convoy shouted to the crowd, "We will set off at exactly 5:00 AM tomorrow morning." We gathered in a small, poorly equipped inn. The reporter slept on the only bed in the inn, tossing and turning all night, feeling extremely uncomfortable. After dinner, a servant came in to tell me that there was another foreigner downstairs. Driven by curiosity, I went downstairs to see what was going on. I saw a rosy-cheeked Catholic priest dining with a Chinese companion. He had arrived on a truck. It is said that he was bringing medical supplies and other necessities to the Italian church in Fancheng. The Catholic priest was very polite to the reporter. Because we had no other language in common other than Chinese, we spoke in Chinese after dinner. According to him, he has lived in China for eleven years, and their current position is extremely delicate. It is unfounded to say that they are carrying out espionage work because of the problems caused by refugees and other wars. The next day, he set off very early again. When the reporter was looking for his truck in the dim morning light, he found a female staff member in military uniform sitting on the footboard of another truck, breastfeeding her baby. Her soldier husband was busy piling luggage on the truck. Since China has decided to resist the war for a long time, there is considerable reason for women to combine war work, marriage, and childbirth in one place. The mobile nature of the march and the inseparability of the Chinese military and civilians are also what make this situation possible. In the afternoon, the road was still muddy due to the rain. In the morning, the wheels of the truck we were riding in often got stuck in the mud and ditches along the road. Whenever this happened, the passengers had to get out of the car in order to push and pull the vehicle. We twice had to unload the several boxes of bombs on the truck before we could push the truck out of danger. Along the way, we saw handcarts full of cotton going to Shaanxi. The larger ones required three people to push. The cars were all equipped with bamboo poles with cloth sails attached to take advantage of the wind and save labor. It was the first time the reporter had seen this kind of handcart. The car stopped in Jinmen Town at 2:00 PM to buy food. Unexpectedly, just as he was about to get out of the car to look for a restaurant, he heard the air raid alarm sound loudly. We all ran back to where the vehicles were parked and drove the vehicles to avoid them elsewhere. The passengers also looked for places to hide. Fortunately, we did not encounter any danger. The commander of the convoy decided to continue moving forward, with only a few minutes of delay along the way, and finally arrived at its destination at 10:00 PM. We had driven for sixteen hours and had nothing to eat except for the rough pancakes made on the side of the road. Although it was wartime in China, the trip was still quite enjoyable.

### Americans at the San Francisco Exposition Encourage Support for China; Overseas Chinese and Americans Hold Anti-Japanese Demonstrations; Dockworkers' Union Forbids Shipment of Munitions to Japan; Japan Also Engages in Propaganda Hoping to Gain American Sympathy

Dispatch from San Francisco from Continental News on May 3: The San Francisco World Exposition designated April 29 as "Japan Day" because it was the Emperor of Japan's birthday. Therefore, the local overseas Chinese and their American friends held two demonstrations, protesting the Japanese military's invasion of China. In the island of Jinmen exposition, there is a Chinese village privately operated by Chinese merchants. The village holds Chinese war relief days to counteract Japanese propaganda. And on the San Francisco waterfront, there is a picket line opposing the shipment of war materials to Japan. The Japanese Commissioner for the San Francisco Exposition has prepared elaborate programs and issued announcements to the American public, attempting to gain the sympathy of the American people for Japan. The Japanese Ambassador left Washington to personally welcome senior American officials, foreign commissioners, and civic leaders of San Francisco to the exposition. Forty Japanese women came here from Japan to dance in the War Memorial Opera House on Treasure Island. The Japanese Consul General warmly entertained guests when the Japanese Ambassador was in the city. The leaders of the American United China Relief understand that this propaganda will have a significant impact on the American people. Therefore, they visited the manager of the Chinese village on Treasure Island, donating one day's proceeds to aid Chinese refugees, and devising a Chinese program. If they cannot overwhelm Japanese propaganda, they must at least match it. All the overseas Chinese in San Francisco responded to the call of their leaders yesterday and held a "One Bowl Rice Dinner" on Treasure Island to raise money to aid Chinese war refugees. This dinner garnered more sympathy and assistance than "Japan Day." On that day, 40,000 yuan in Chinese national currency was raised. The American people immediately responded to China's needs with announcements and appeals. While the Chinese people were conducting relief efforts on Treasure Island, more than 500 of their American friends set up a picket line at Pier 48 in San Francisco to oppose the shipment of war materials to Japan. The effort was led by the "San Francisco Committee Against Shipping War Materials to Japan," an organization composed of eighty American groups that united to stop the flow of American arms to Japan. As of the evening of April 27, the Japanese cargo ship Asahikaze Maru was still loading explosives at Pier 48. American dockworkers stopped loading war materials on the 28th as soon as the picketers arrived. The next morning (the Emperor of Japan's birthday), the picketers appeared. The cargo ship left port without completing its loading. Civilians, laborers, and women leaders then gave impassioned speeches and raised money to send telegrams to California congressmen and Washington senators, endorsing Pittman's straightforward resolution to embargo war materials to Japan. If the Japanese Commissioner for the San Francisco World Exposition thought they could use their Emperor's birthday to spread their propaganda, the wind will blow in the wrong direction. The American people are clearly more determined to restrain dictators and isolate aggressors, but how to shorten the war remains a matter of debate in Washington and throughout the United States.

### Status of Puppets in Xuzhou: Dangerous Investigation of British, American, and Russian Goods

Xuzhou dispatch: The recent situation in Xuzhou after its occupation by the Japanese army is as follows: The old cigarette factory is where the Japanese army stockpiles munitions, gasoline, and the like. The China Bank warehouse on Nanma Road stores a large number of Japanese cars, numbering in the hundreds. The former site of the China Bank in the city houses the highest Japanese commander, the Japanese military police headquarters, in the Municipal Mint. The organ that interrogates the people is located in the Tiancheng Company, and the special services are still located in the Bank of Communications. The puppet "mayor" of Xuzhou is Zhang Yunsheng, the puppet "county magistrate" of Tongshan is Li Haichun, the chairman of the puppet chamber of commerce is Li Aitang, the head of the puppet public security bureau is Yang Shixu, and the president of the puppet local court is Tian Xiangnong (formerly Wang Ruisheng). The head of the puppet cultural affairs section is Zhou De. Zhou Zhi, Chen Wenzhao, Jin Xiaohu, and Wang Xianchen have all "assumed office". The Japanese army has opened six elementary schools in Xuzhou, with few students. The puppet principals and teachers in each school are the dregs of the education world. Every time the Japanese army goes to the countryside, they force the puppet public security bureau police to lead the way unarmed as scouts to probe the way and prevent guerrilla ambushes, causing the police to take the opportunity to escape. The puppet Xuzhou municipal government is now actively promoting a policy of enslavement, forcing children to attend school, stipulating that they study Japanese for three hours a day, and ordering the puppet youth association to organize various propaganda teams to inspect goods from countries such as Britain, the United States, and Russia. The puppet county government has now changed the puppet maintenance societies in various places to districts. Each district has a chief and deputy chief. Except for Xucheng, which is under the direct jurisdiction of the puppet municipal government, the towns and villages are divided into eight districts.

### Battle for Yixing: Three Recaptures and Three Counterattacks

Yixing dispatch: The New Fourth Army's Deng's troops previously recaptured Lishui. After fierce street fighting, the Japanese army retreated to the north gate. The New Fourth Army then took advantage of the victory to recover Qishan Heights in Yixing County, killing more than twenty Japanese soldiers, capturing many rifles, and capturing two Japanese female spies. They charged into the upper city from the north. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly and retreated to Xiebu Market. The New Fourth Army surrounded Xiebu Market again. After five days and nights of intense street fighting, there were up to three counterattacks. The Chinese army was determined to coexist with the city and vowed not to withdraw, so the losses were extremely heavy. Twenty bridges have been destroyed on the road between Wuxi and Yixing, as well as sixty Su li of road surface and twenty-two Chinese li of electric poles and wires. As of yesterday, the county seat of Yixing was still in the hands of the Chinese army, despite fierce sieges by the Japanese army.

### Discovery of Japanese Corpses in Canal; Accusation Against Puppet Magistrate of Yangzhou

Taixian Correspondence: In the downstream section of the canal, near the third and fourth culvert areas, a large number of Japanese military corpses have been discovered in recent days. It is learned that these are from the battle at the first culvert some time ago, where they were shot by Chinese forces and fell into the water, only to float up recently. The number of Japanese casualties in that battle is evident from this.

The puppet magistrate of Jiangdu is accused by a Mr. Hu at the puppet provincial government of embezzling 220,000 yuan in funds. Mr. Hu also stated that the magistrate and a Japanese squad leader from Yangzhou named Gui Wulang are colluding for their own gain. The puppet provincial government has dispatched Mr. Hu to investigate and report, while the puppet Executive Yuan has also sent a Mr. Yang for thorough investigation. Currently, the magistrate is attempting to cover the deficit by forcing each village to pay "comfort money" ranging from 100 yuan upwards, causing extreme resentment among the populace.

### Difficult to Predict Davis Cup Match Between Germany and Poland; Polish Player Wins Against Menczel Again; Final Singles Will Decide the Outcome

(Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 23rd) The Davis Cup tennis European Zone second round elimination match between Germany and Poland has been ongoing for three days since the study trip. Germany and Poland each won one singles match the other day. After Germany won a match the day before yesterday, Germany was ahead with two wins against one. Yesterday the last two singles matches were held. In the first match, Germany's Menczel faced Poland's Banowski (Havas writes Rochewski). As a result, the Polish representative defeated Germany's Menczel by three to two, tying the score at two to two. Therefore, the key to victory depends entirely on the last match, the singles match between Germany's Henkel and Poland's Trocinski. Because this group is of great importance, the competition was extremely tense. Even the spectators in the court reacted to the loss or gain of a ball with joy or anger. However, the game was stopped due to darkness in the third set and was unable to finish, and will continue today. The winner will enter the third week and meet Sweden. Yesterday's results are as follows:

Henkel (Germany) vs. Trocinski (Poland) Group, the game stopped due to darkness when the score reached six to four, six to two, and one to one.

### An Unprecedented Number of Years: Japanese Yen Plummets to a Record Low; Yesterday Morning, it Fell to 89 Fen Against Legal Tender; It Seems Japanese Banking Circles Are Not Offering Support

Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the new monetary policy, nationalizing silver and eliminating speculation, money exchange businesses have been significantly affected. However, since the outbreak of the war and the deterioration of the situation in Shanghai, wealthy individuals have rushed to purchase foreign currencies, causing the industry to flourish again. Furthermore, due to the adoption of the remittance draft system in Shanghai, money exchange shops have been engaging in remittance discounting, yielding substantial profits. Subsequently, with the gradual resumption of inland transportation, travelers needed Japanese yen, and the buying and selling of yen by these businesses also became busy. Consequently, investors in Shanghai, witnessing the development of this industry, have been raising funds to open new shops, and the number continues to increase. The Sichuan Road area is densely populated with money exchange shops, representing the most prosperous period of the industry. Each shop has been reaping substantial profits. Recently, the largest transactions for these money exchange shops have been the buying and selling of Japanese yen bills. Money exchange shops in the Sichuan Road area have been trading over three million yuan in Japanese yen daily. However, the price of the Japanese yen has been falling drastically, barely reaching 90% of Chinese legal tender. Yesterday, it fell further to 89 fen (meaning one Japanese yen is worth 89 fen of legal tender). It is said that the main reason for the drastic fall is that someone sold off Japanese yen in bulk. At the same time, it is rumored that someone bought a large amount of Chinese legal tender to replenish the issuing reserves of a certain bank, and some were attempting to acquire Chinese legal tender by leveraging Japanese yen. As for "Hua Yu" banknotes, it is said that they have been discovered in Hongkou, but the price is unclear. However, because foreign banks and others are refusing to accept them, money exchange shops have also decided to refuse to exchange them.

Demand for Japanese Yen Has Clearly Decreased

The English-language 大美晚報 (Greater Shanghai Evening Post) stated that this morning (the 23rd), the Japanese yen reached a new low, with its value plummeting to 88 fen against legal tender. It is said to be the lowest price of the Japanese yen in decades. At 10:30 this morning, exchange shops on Sichuan Road were buying Japanese yen at 88 fen and selling them at 88.4 fen. However, this exchange rate improved slightly in the afternoon, with the buying rate at 89 fen and the selling rate at 89.4 fen. In other words, this afternoon, one could purchase 100 Japanese yen for 89 yuan and 40 fen of legal tender. The recent continued decline of the Japanese yen here is due to the decreased demand for Japanese yen in both Shanghai and Hong Kong. The low demand for Japanese yen is proportional to the increasing difficulty in using these banknotes to purchase Japanese goods.

Payment of Foreign Exchange for Japanese-Manchukuo Goods

In recent weeks, the Japanese authorities have placed greater restrictions on foreign tourists and Japanese individuals bringing Japanese yen back to Japan from Shanghai and Hong Kong. Furthermore, the use of Japanese yen to pay for Japanese "Manchukuo" goods imported into Shanghai has largely been halted. For example, "Manchukuo" soybeans imported into Shanghai used to have a portion of the price paid in Japanese yen for several months. However, since last month, the export of "Manchukuo" soybeans has been controlled by the "government," and Dalian exporters have had to insist on payment in foreign exchange. These recent developments have forced the Japanese yen to fall below legal tender on the open market in Shanghai. However, the Japanese yen market price in Shanghai has often been 30% lower than the face value for almost a year. As early as last July, one could purchase 100 Japanese yen in Japanese banknotes for 100 to 110 yuan of legal tender.

Two Important Factors

The depreciation of the Japanese yen is, in principle, determined by two factors: The one yen of the Bank of Japan is equal to one shilling and two pence. Considering the increase in the amount of banknotes in circulation, the soaring domestic prices in Japan, and the decrease in the Bank of Japan's reserves, the ratio is indeed too high. Even if there were not a large amount of Japanese yen circulating in Central China, the price of Japanese yen banknotes in Shanghai would inevitably be lower than in Japan. The fact that a very large amount of Japanese yen is circulating in Central China inevitably puts additional pressure on the local Japanese yen market price.

Circulating Currency Not Recalled

Before the so-called military scrip circulated, the Japanese army circulated Japanese yen in Central China to purchase goods and conduct other transactions. It seemed that this stopped last autumn. However, the Japanese yen banknotes that were already in circulation at that time were not recalled. Since then, they have appeared in the Central China market. It is estimated that between 30 million and 50 million Japanese yen are circulating in Central China. The Japanese side's refusal to recall the Japanese yen circulating in the Central China region by exchanging it for currency or goods has resulted in a further drop in the Japanese yen.

Future Results Quite Similar to the Mark

This depreciation will of course have an adverse impact on the Japanese yen within Japan. However, the Bank of Japan is unlikely to take any action to support the value of Japanese yen banknotes in Shanghai. If support is provided, it can only be done by re-establishing the possibility of recalling the Japanese yen, but this is precisely what Japan does not want to do. Japan's treatment of Japanese yen circulating in Shanghai is similar in some respects to the German government's treatment of the mark circulating abroad. Germany completely disregards the circulation of its banknotes overseas and minimizes the possibility of recalling them. As a result, the ratio of German banknotes overseas is only half of the face value of the mark. Japan may decide to follow in Germany's footsteps.

The Japanese Side Claims Excessive Circulation in Shanghai

The French-language 上海日報 (Shanghai Daily) of the 23rd reported that during a Japanese press briefing yesterday, someone questioned the issue of the Japanese yen's depreciation. According to the spokesman of the Japanese embassy, this is a phenomenon of economic supply and demand imbalance, and there is nothing surprising about it. According to the spokesman, recently, more and more Japanese yen have been arriving in Shanghai. Every time a ship arrives from Japan, more than a thousand passengers arrive in Shanghai, each carrying a considerable amount of Japanese currency to supply the market. However, the Shanghai market cannot absorb so much Japanese currency at once, which has an impact on the exchange rate. Upon investigation, this explanation raises many doubts. 明日木報 (another French-language newspaper, self-described) will investigate. 字林報 (North China Daily News) reported that when reporters were invited yesterday (the 22nd), they inquired about the sudden drop in the Japanese yen exchange rate, which was only worth 92 fen of legal tender yesterday. The spokesman replied that there were various factors, the main one being the issue of supply and demand. He also said that a large number of Japanese people came to Shanghai, thousands on each ship, which naturally caused the Japanese yen to fall. When asked if the Japanese who came to Shanghai were all related to the Japanese army, the spokesman replied that most were tourists.

### Self-Defense Army's First Detachment Arrives at Fahua and Qibao; Part of the Third Detachment Crosses the River to Southern Pudong; Establishes Contact with Guerrilla Units in Pudong

Since the start of the Western Zhejiang battles on the 13th of this month, news of Chinese army victories has been frequently reported, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. Therefore, the morale of the Chinese army along the Nanjing-Shanghai line has been greatly boosted. Various units of the Jiangzhe People's Self-Defense Army have entered the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changshu area along the Nanjing-Shanghai line to increase strength. Recently, traces of the First Detachment of this army have also been found in the Qibao and Fahua areas of the Shanghai suburbs. Part of the Third Detachment has crossed the river to Southern Pudong and established contact with various guerrilla units in Pudong, preparing to cooperate and launch a large-scale counter-offensive.

The Japanese Side Attempts to Fight in the Inner Harbor

The Japanese transport ship Kashi Maru entered the port and arrived in Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday, docking at the Yangshupu waterfront. The ship was loaded with a large number of wooden motorboats, numbering over 500, all newly manufactured, clearly intended for combat in the inner harbor.

Japanese Build Barracks Near North Station

The Japanese side has recently cleared over one hundred acres of land near the North Railway Station to build large barracks and built a pillbox around each barrack. A radio station is set up in the center to communicate with all parties. Each pillbox is equipped with two anti-aircraft guns to prevent Chinese army bombing. Construction has now begun and will take six months to complete.

Detaining Rice Boats and Falsely Accusing Innocent People of Murder

At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a tugboat belonging to a certain company in Southern Pudong's Rice Market Ferry, towing ten rice boats to Shanghai, arrived at the Minhang waterfront and was suddenly detained by the Japanese military police garrison there. At dawn yesterday, a Japanese platoon leader, dressed as a Chinese in a long gown, brought more than ten Japanese soldiers and forced their way onto the tugboat, allowing it to tow two rice boats northward. It was said that they were searching for guerrillas. At 10:00 AM, they arrived at the Dujia Hang waterfront and saw two Chinese civilians standing on the shore of the Puxi side, identifying them as guerrillas. At that time, the platoon leader stood on the deck, and the soldiers hid in the fire cabin and suddenly ordered the opening of machine guns, shooting at the two Chinese. One was killed instantly, and the other was shot in the foot. He was captured by the Japanese soldiers and taken back to Minhang on a Japanese motorboat in the river. The tugboat's boatswain and sailors were released in panic and returned to Shanghai. It was also heard that the "license" had been revoked, and eight rice boats were still being detained.

### US Ambassador to China Johnsson Arrives in Shanghai This Morning; The Ambassador's Wife and Children Arrive Together; Will Stay Briefly in Shanghai Before Going to Chongqing

US Ambassador to China, Dr. Nelson Trusler Johnson, along with his wife and two children, arrived on the US President Lines' President Coolidge liner on the morning of the 6th of this month from San Francisco, USA, to return to his post in China. The Ambassador went ashore in Yokohama, Japan, en route to visit the US Embassy in Japan to convey a certain mission. The Ambassador stayed briefly and that same day returned to the same liner for travel to Shanghai. It is now known that the liner is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8:30 this morning. The Ambassador does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long, and after his family goes to Beiping, he will leave Shanghai for Chongqing. The Ambassador has been in China for nearly thirty years, first coming to China at the age of twenty. According to the Ambassador's shortwave radio broadcast near the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island, USA, on May 5, "He regards China as his second home, the place where his life and spirit are entrusted," and loudly exclaimed "Hello" to his friends in China. The Ambassador also took advantage of the shortwave broadcast to specially inform US diplomatic officials in Chongqing, Mr. Peck, US Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, and Consul in Ping, Mr. Lockheart, that he hopes to seize the opportunity to speak to China. The Ambassador also said, "He loves China, he wants to stay in China forever, because China is the oldest and most civilized country in the Far East." The Ambassador also mentioned the talented Chinese people who reside in San Francisco or Washington and enjoy all the benefits just like Americans. The Ambassador praised the construction of roads in Burma and Kunming as the main foreign routes in southwestern China, praising the Ambassador and said they are the most modern roads of late, noting that his own residence in Chongqing is very comfortable, and that all food supplies are not lacking.

The English-language 大美晚報 (Greater Shanghai Evening Post) reported that US Ambassador to China Nelson Trusler Johnson, accompanied by his wife and two children, will arrive here on the President Coolidge liner early tomorrow morning (the 24th). Also arriving in Shanghai on the same ship are US Rear Admiral Glassford and his wife. Rear Admiral Glassford will serve as the commander of the US Yangtze River Patrol Fleet.

### Hoarding Households Release Goods, Supplies Replenished; Purchase of Foreign Rice Concluded; Production Areas Such as Suzhou and Changshu Have Also Lifted Bans; Rice Industry Still Complies with Price Evaluation Resolution

Since the sources of rice have been unblocked, rice reserves have increased, and public sentiment in the market has gradually stabilized. The rice industry's purchase of foreign rice for regulation has been concluded, with the first batch of 2,000 tons scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai next month. Many hoarding households are also releasing goods, market order is gradually being restored, and rice prices are easing. Overall public food security is no longer in danger of shortage. All rice industry groups should continue to abide by the resolutions of the Price Evaluation Committee. Details are recorded as follows:

First Batch of Foreign Rice to be Shipped to Shanghai Next Month

In order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai citizens, in addition to the Price Evaluation Committee's recommendation that the Concession authorities purchase foreign rice and unblock sources, it has now entrusted the 達孚 (Duffus) foreign firm to order 2,000 tons of foreign rice from Saigon, purchased by 順泰 (Shun Tai), 順豐 (Shun Feng), 正大 (Zheng Da), 厚德 (Hou De), and other four companies, at a price of 19 yuan and 40 fen in national currency. The transaction has been concluded and is scheduled to be loaded onto ships in Saigon at the beginning of June and shipped to Shanghai. A second batch is still being negotiated by telegram. Once the transaction is concluded, it will also be shipped to Shanghai in batches. It is reported that the quality of this foreign rice is quite good.

Reserves Arrive, Replenishing Food Supply, No Fear of Shortage

Shanghai rice industry groups are still actively working to unblock the sources of domestic rice. At present, all rice-producing areas, such as Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Wuhu, etc., have lifted the ban, allowing rice exports, and the number of rice shipments to Shanghai will increase daily. Yesterday, 78 trucks of supplies arrived from various sources along the river, totaling more than 3,000 bags. However, because these domestic rice are subject to heavy local taxes, the cost has increased, so the selling price is also above the Shanghai market price limit. According to the eighth survey report on rice reserves in Shanghai, the city still has 557,840 bags, an increase of 4,592 bags from the previous period. Therefore, the food supply for Shanghai citizens is definitely not in danger of shortage.

Unblocking Sources, Hoarding Households Release Goods

Because rice-producing areas in various locations have decided to lift the ban, merchants from various gangs have resumed purchases and shipments to Shanghai for replenishment. Therefore, public sentiment in the bean and rice market has stabilized, and hoarding households are also releasing goods, gradually restoring market order. The market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday and closed at 12:00 PM, with a total of 6,000 to 7,000 bags transacted. However, the opening calls were 17 yuan and 70 fen or 17 yuan and 80 fen, with slight increases in the middle. Because the "Na Wei" brand was more popular, Changshu top white japonica rice was transacted at 17 yuan and 85 fen. Recently, sales at the door of various rice shops have gradually decreased as public sentiment has stabilized, so business has become sluggish.

Rice Industry Still Complies with Resolutions

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Shop Industry Association, the Rice Industry Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, the Changshu Rice Association, the Southern Gang Rice Association, and the Shanghai Northern Rice Merchant Association, after the Rice Industry Group Price Evaluation Committee disbanded itself, have been concerned about future work. Leaders of the above rice industry groups held an informal meeting a few days ago to discuss future rice industry work. It was resolved to proceed step by step in accordance with the plans discussed by the Rice Industry Group Price Evaluation Committee and never stop, with each rice industry group responsible for supervision. As for the various groups in the city requesting the Concession authorities to quickly find a solution, it has not been confirmed.

Financial Department Studies Entire Solution

Since rice prices have soared and black market trading has flourished, the Price Evaluation Committee has found it difficult to proceed and has decided to dissolve itself, and has sent letters to the two Concession authorities reporting the process. It is now known that the 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) Finance Department is studying in detail, based on the rice industry groups' descriptions, how to unblock sources and balance market prices. Once a concrete decision is made, it will be implemented. Strict measures will be taken against hoarding and black market trading to maintain normal market transactions.

### A Shocking Armed Robbery of a Car; One Person Fell Behind and Was Captured by Taiwanese; The Lost Car Has Not Been Found, Details Unknown

—衆信 (Zhongxin News Agency) Believes the Case May Be a Robbery of Opium—

字林報 (North China Daily News) reported that just after 3:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd), a shocking armed robbery occurred in the Public Concession, a case shrouded in mystery. Eleven Chinese, mostly armed with Mauser pistols, forced a private car carrying five Taiwanese to stop on North Suzhou Road, forced the people in the car to get out, and then drove the car away. Two of the robbers did not make it into the car. One escaped, but the other was captured by the Taiwanese, taken to the Sichuan Road Bridge, and handed over to the Japanese sentry. Before long, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Command

Sent a Troop of Soldiers

To the Sichuan Road Bridge and took away the arrested person. The reporter asked senior police officers about this matter, but they refused to provide details. It is heard that detectives from the Western Hongkou, Hongkou, and Central Police Stations were investigating the case yesterday, but their work was very secretive. Even if we recognize that this incident definitely happened, what

Seems to Be Certain

Is that the Taiwanese shouted for help when they were threatened with guns. A Chinese police officer must have sounded the alarm, and the sound was heard not only by residents near the scene of the incident but also by some Chinese on the south bank of Suzhou Creek. When they arrived at the scene, the car had already fled, and the Taiwanese had captured a robber. Last night, 衆信 (Zhongxin News Agency) believed that the nature of this robbery must be very serious; otherwise, it would be difficult to obtain news of this case.

A Brief Report

Has already been issued to the press. It is speculated that these Chinese were waiting for the car and forced it to stop. Their purpose was not to rob the people in the car. If that were the purpose, they would have searched everyone before allowing them to continue driving. Therefore, what they intended to rob was what was in the car, and they planned to rob the car. Moreover, the robbers did not intend to harm the people in the car but only wanted them to leave the car. This is also evident. Therefore, there is much speculation

About What Was in the Car

衆信 (Zhongxin News Agency) believes that there may have been drugs in the car, and the robbers robbed them. The circumstances of this case are similar to the case a few months ago when robbers robbed a large amount of opium on Route Tenant de la Tour. The car transporting opium was later found abandoned in the French Concession. However, according to inquiries this morning, the lost car in yesterday's case has not yet been found. It is heard that the car owner, a Taiwanese, was interrogated by detectives from the Hongkou West Police Station yesterday. However,

The Fate of the Arrested Robber

Is still unknown. It is reliably claimed that the Taiwanese should have handed over the arrested person to the Central Police Station instead of to the Japanese sentry on Sichuan Bridge. Therefore, it is expected that Japanese Naval Landing Forces officers will eventually transfer him to the Shanghai Municipal Police for interrogation after obtaining a confession from him.

### More Than 300 Jewish Refugees Arrive

大陸報 (Continental News) reported that 308 Jewish refugees, men, women, and children, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 22nd) on the Italian ship Victoria. Most were accommodated in the 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council)聂中丞華童公學 (Nie Zhongcheng Chinese Children's Public School) on Jingzhou Road.

### Japanese Planes Bombing Zhenhai Fortress, Chinese Side Not Damaged, Italian Ship 康沙義 (Cangshayee) Arrives at Zhenhai Port Yesterday, 哈納 (Hana) Does Not Abandon Shanghai-Dinghai Route

According to a report received by the shipping industry the day before yesterday afternoon, there was another air raid alert in Ningbo at around 10:00 AM on the 22nd, which was lifted only in the afternoon. Since no further report was received, the details were unknown. It was not until the night before last that another telegram was received, stating that four Japanese planes invaded the airspace over Zhenhai at noon on the 22nd and dropped ten bombs on the fortress there, but most of the bombs landed in the wilderness, and the Chinese side did not suffer any losses. Therefore, the area is still peaceful, but residents of the urban area have already evacuated automatically, and the city is relatively depressed.

Purchasing Foreign Rice, Holding Price-Stabilized Sales

The population in eastern Zhejiang has increased dramatically since the war, and the local food supply is insufficient, resulting in soaring prices, which affect the livelihoods of ordinary people. The provincial authorities have repeatedly tried to purchase and transport Jiangxi rice for regulation. The Ningbo gentry and merchants, in order to prepare funds and suppress rice prices, previously telegraphed the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association to purchase 100,000 piculs of foreign rice to be transported to Ningbo for price-stabilized sales to benefit the poor. It was agreed that the losses would be borne equally by the Ningbo Fellow Association and the Ningbo gentry and merchants. It is now known that the request has been submitted to the higher authorities for approval. Once approved, the rice will be purchased and transported to Ningbo for relief.

Shanghai-Ningbo Route Ships Operate as Usual

Since the Ningbo Defense Command restored navigation on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the 德商禮和洋和 (German 礼和 (Reho)) Yanghe's ship 謀福 (Moufu) has taken the lead in trial navigation and arrived safely in Ningbo. 中意公司 (Sino-Italian Company)'s ship 康沙義 (Cangshayee) also loaded cargo and sailed to Ningbo at around 4:00 PM on the 22nd and arrived at Zhenhai Port yesterday morning. The 德平 (De Ping) ship is also scheduled to set sail at 4:00 PM this afternoon, increasing sailings on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Navigation on the Shanghai-Ningbo route has gradually returned to normal.

哈納 (Hana) Will Temporarily Sail to Wenzhou Tomorrow Morning

德商遠東輪船公司 (German Far East Shipping Company)'s ship 哈納 (Hana), since resuming the Shanghai-Dinghai route, has already made four sailings, and navigation has been quite smooth. However, because the Dinghai authorities have banned passengers and restricted loading, both passengers and cargo have been extremely scarce. The ship was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai the day before yesterday but was delayed until yesterday afternoon before setting sail from Dinghai and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is heard that the company has decided to change its route to Wenzhou, with a direct sailing from Shanghai tomorrow morning, but only for one or two sailings. Afterwards, it will still sail the Shanghai-Dinghai route.

### 姜豪 (Jiang Hao) and Others Have Not Been Released

Regarding the five people who were detained by the Japanese side at the 福來飯店 (Fulai Hotel) on Guangxi Road a few days ago: former Municipal Party Committee alternate executive member 姜豪 (Jiang Hao), Jiangwan Security Corps leader 吳垂瑩 (Wu Chuiying), Baoshan County Party Committee members 洪光華 (Hong Guanghua), 陳嘉謨 (Chen Jiamo), and 蘇亮如 (Su Liangru), rumors from all sides vary. Some say they have all been killed, while others say they have been released one after another. After investigation, it has been confirmed that there is no definite news of the release of the five. It is said that they are being held in the 四行倉庫 (Four Banks Warehouse). Their families are currently working to rescue them.

### Shanghai Once Again Holds the Center of National Trade; Prosperous Trade at the Jianghai Customs in April; Total Value Exceeds 88 Million Yuan

### Portuguese Vessel Detained, Issue Still Unresolved; German Vessel Also Detained; Forcibly Towed by Japanese to Berth at Buoy No. 19; Portuguese Consul to Await Miura's Return to Shanghai to Continue Negotiations

The "Fa De," a gasoline-powered sailboat belonging to the Portuguese trading company Far East Navigation Company in this city, had been moored at the Longmao Dock in Pudong since the previous detention incident and had not set sail. Recently, the company planned to move the vessel to Buoy No. 30 in Yangshupu. Last Saturday at 3:00 PM, the captain sailed it away from the dock. Unexpectedly, while waiting to secure the cable to the buoy, a Japanese naval motorboat arrived and boarded the vessel, forcibly towing it to Buoy No. 19 and detaining it. The company immediately reported the matter to the Portuguese Consulate General, requesting negotiations based on reason. It has been found that the Portuguese vessels illegally detained by the Japanese include "Tang Bei," "Tang Lu," "Tang Qiao," "Mei Da," "Hai Long," "Li Bao," as well as the diesel ships "Bao De," "Mi Mei," "Da De," and the recently detained "Fa De." Former Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Alves, had repeatedly submitted written protests and conducted serious negotiations, but nearly two months have passed without any concrete results. Portuguese merchants generally believe that their legitimate rights and interests have been illegally undermined, causing great resentment. After the new Portuguese Consul took office, they jointly requested that he continue negotiations to protect their legal rights. According to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency, the Portuguese Consulate is waiting for Japanese Consul Miura to return to Shanghai from a trip abroad before raising a strong objection, seeking an early resolution to the case.

### Hongkou Car Accident Case Continued Hearing Yesterday; One of the Passengers Testifies

Public Bus Drove Too Fast and Swayed; Japanese Military Police Held the Steering Wheel of Mr. Liddell's Car

The "North-China Daily News" reports: British Coroner Haines continued yesterday (the 22nd) to hear the case of Mr. Liddell, the deceased former principal of the Lester School, who died on April 24th near Broadway and Minhang Road after his car collided with a Japanese public bus. An Iranian passenger on the public bus testified, claiming that the bus was driving too fast, which he estimated to be between 45 and 50 miles per hour. He also claimed to have witnessed a Japanese marine soldier being crushed between the two vehicles and dying from serious injuries, with his

left hand tightly gripping

the steering wheel of Mr. Liddell's car. Mrs. Liddell, who was injured in the accident, did not appear in court yesterday. Mr. Wimsett, a Western inspector of the Public Concession police who was also injured, will not be able to leave the hospital for three weeks. The first witness was Mr. Plesse, from the water company, who told the coroner that at 6:45 PM on April 24th, he went to Mr. Liddell's residence on Avenue Haig because Mr. Liddell had just returned to Shanghai from England. During the conversation, Mr. Liddell told the witness that he would return to the "Gneisenau" (the ship that brought Mr. Liddell back to Shanghai that day) to retrieve two pipes he had left on board.

two pipes

The witness drove his private car across Suzhou Creek to Seward Road and the Lester School. Mr. Liddell drove his private car parked at the school, while Mrs. Liddell remained in the witness's car. The two cars drove together to the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf to board the ship and ask a servant to search for the pipes. The witness and the other two remained in the smoking room. After about 15 to 20 minutes, the servant said he could not find the pipes. The three then left the ship, with the witness driving ahead, but he did not see Mr. Liddell following behind. As he approached Broadway Bridge, the witness stopped because he knew there was an obstruction on the bridge. He

saw the obstruction

had been pushed to the left, but the entrance and exit were very narrow. After the sentry nodded, the witness drove forward, but at that time he noticed that the obstruction had no lights, only a small notice board in Japanese or Chinese and Japanese. The streetlights were also quite dim and did not illuminate the obstruction. After driving over Garden Bridge, the witness stopped in front of the Cathay Hotel. The witness further replied to the coroner's questions, saying that Mr. Liddell had not drunk excessively on the ship and was in a normal state. Mr. Liddell was not aware of the obstruction on Broadway Bridge and found it difficult to avoid while driving. At this point, Iranian Mr. Oghahar, speaking in Russian, testified that he was a merchant living on Fair Avenue. At around 9:15 PM that evening, he boarded a Japanese public bus at Broadway Mansions to return home. Shortly after the bus started, it collided with a car. He then discovered that the car belonged to Mr. Liddell. He did not see exactly what happened during the collision. At the time of the collision, he was thrown from the back seat to the front of the driver's seat. The driver had already fallen down, and he saw a Chinese man jump out of the window. He followed him out. The Chinese ticket seller was standing next to the driver. After leaving the bus, he did not pay attention to the damaged vehicles because they were crashed together, and the damage could not be seen in the dark. There were three people on the sidewalk on the left, one was a police officer, and one was Mr. Liddell, both lying on the ground. Mrs. Liddell was sitting on the sidewalk and calling out "My handbag." When the witness entered the car to search, he saw someone crushed between the two vehicles. Only after the person was rescued did he learn that it was a Japanese marine soldier. The witness saw the handbag in the car but did not touch it and waited for the police to arrive. However, there was an Italian marine soldier. The witness further replied to the coroner's questions, saying that when he boarded the public bus, it was raining and the road surface was wet. The public bus was driving very fast and swaying from side to side. The minimum speed was at least 45 miles per hour, which was faster than ordinary public buses. He saw the Japanese soldier being crushed between the two vehicles with his left hand gripping the steering wheel of Mr. Liddell's car. The coroner then adjourned the hearing to continue at 10:00 AM on Thursday.

### Zhang Bingxin's Estate Dispute: Court Orders Settlement

Zhang Bingxin, a wealthy local jewelry merchant, died of illness at the Chinese Red Cross Hospital in October of the year before last. He left behind real estate and immovable property, as well as jewelry, jadeite treasures, and cash worth hundreds of thousands. His friend Tu Zhengge and others sealed the suitcases and entrusted them to Zhang's elderly mother, Mrs. Zhang Ou. However, Zhang's concubines, Mrs. Qin and Mrs. Dai, colluded with Zhang's adopted son, Zhang Haoqiu, to remove the sealed suitcases of inheritance without Mrs. Zhang Ou's consent, and after dividing them up on their own, they lived separately, disregarding Mrs. Zhang Ou (who is 75 years old this year). Therefore, Mrs. Zhang Ou appointed lawyers Ge Zhiqin and Sun Deji to file a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special Court against Zhang Qin, Zhang Dai, Zhang Haoqiu, etc., for theft and abandonment of an elder, and filed an incidental civil lawsuit, demanding the return of the suitcases of property. The initial trial was presided over by Judge Jiao Qingbang, who ruled the defendants not guilty and dismissed the incidental civil lawsuit. In the judgment, the identity and status of the plaintiff, Mrs. Zhang Ou, were reversed, listing Mrs. Zhang Ou as the wife of the deceased Zhang Bingxin. Therefore, Mrs. Zhang Ou disagreed with the judgment and again appointed lawyers Ge and Sun to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. The details have been published in newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge He Jingcen of the Third Branch of the High Court summoned both parties to open an investigation hearing. The appellant, i.e., the plaintiff, Mrs. Zhang Ou, was old and ill and was represented by her lawyer. The appellees, i.e., the defendants, Zhang Qin, Zhang Dai, Zhang Haoqiu, etc., arrived with their defense lawyers, Shen Weihan and Sun Qiying. After questioning the appellees one by one, the court learned that Zhang Bingxin managed his own property during his lifetime, and after his death, the sealed suitcases were claimed by the three of them to be stored at Huang Ruisheng's house, and then divided at lawyer Shen Weihan's office. They claimed that they moved out because Mrs. Zhang Ou had abused the daughters-in-law. Finally, the court stated that this case clearly arose because the appellees divided the property without the appellant's consent, the division was uneven, and the elderly person was disregarded, leading to the lawsuit. It was hoped that they would eventually be a family, and that the civil lawsuit could be settled outside of court first, which would make the criminal case easier to resolve. If a settlement could not be reached, the court would handle the case according to the law. Finally, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. The appellees respectfully complied with the order and withdrew.

The remaining defendants were involved in other cases and requested a postponement. Judge Xiao reviewed the confessions and ordered that Chen Xu's wife and the other eight be released first, while the rest would be detained pending further review. It is reported that the two pistols seized by the police were confessed by the defendants at the police station as having been supplied by Sun Shucheng, who runs a gambling den in western Shanghai.

Chuan Rongfeng, the owner of the Ronghua Tang Bookstore on Jixiang Street in the French Concession, is handsome, wealthy, and has a penchant for dancing. Lin Aina, a dance hall girl at the Dahu Ballroom, is the cherished daughter of Mrs. Gu Zhao, who resides at 12 Ruikang Lane, Beijing Road. She is 19 years old, with a face like a full moon and a figure like Yang Guifei. Every time Chuan goes to Dahu, he chooses her as his dancing partner. Over time, they become close, and when he learns that she is still a virgin, he increases his

day and night pursuit

and pays her great attention. Finally, he achieves his goal in a certain hotel. After Chuan has tasted her once, because his other plans have not yet been fulfilled, he continues to tempt her with sweet words, promising to grow old together. They went to the Rainbow Temple and swore vows of marriage before the gods. Seeing Chuan's deep affection, Aina believed that he would not betray her, and followed his wishes, quitting her embrace-for-hire life at the employer and staying at home, quietly waiting to be married. Four months have passed, but after Chuan's second plan was successful, he turned his back on her as if he did not know her. Aina

began to realize she had been deceived

and cried at home all day. Her mother, Mrs. Gu Zhao, repeatedly questioned her, and the girl revealed the facts, saying that not only had Chuan destroyed her chastity, but all her private savings of more than 2,000 yuan had also been swindled away. Mrs. Gu believes that Chuan Rongfeng is so lustful and greedy, that he abandoned her daughter after taking advantage of her, and that he has been too abusive. She specially asked lawyer Li Ming to write a letter to Chuan for negotiations, demanding compensation for the 2,500 yuan that had been swindled away and compensation for 10,000 yuan in damages to her reputation. Later, because Chuan ignored her, she

advertised a warning

detailing Chuan's acts of seducing her daughter and swindling her dance money, and concluding that Chuan's criminal nature was even more serious. After hearing this, Chuan hired lawyer Wu Chuliang, who also published a reply in the newspaper, and filed a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Gu Zhao and Lin Aina for publishing defamatory words and damaging his reputation, claiming that they fabricated slander as a basis for extortion, and requested that the

court punish them

Yesterday morning, Judge Fang Qinghuan opened the court to summon and examine them. The defendant mother and daughter, along with their defense lawyer Yu Hualong, appeared in court, while the plaintiff, Chuan Rongfeng, claimed to be ill and his lawyer appeared in court to state the grounds for the lawsuit. Judge Fang then ordered a ban on public attendance because the content of the case was related to public morals. After questioning the two defendants, he ordered a postponement for further interrogation.

When Chen died of illness at his home at 281 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession in December of last year, Li Jinfeng took her children to mourn him, but was refused entry by Chen's eldest and second sons, Chen Weishan and Chen Weixian. Chen Li Jinfeng, acting as the legal guardian, along with her sons Damao, Er Mao, San Mao, Xiao Mao, and daughter Meimei, hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Li Gengxiang, Yang Yunshi, and Ge Bangren to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Chen Weixian, Chen Weishan, etc., to confirm their identities and confirm that Damao and others were the children of the deceased Chen Lansheng.

### Abandoned Bride After Few Months of Marriage: Minnan Young Woman Sues for Divorce

Zhang Lingyuan, a young man from Ningbo who graduated from Chaoyang University in Beiping, married Huang Guihua, a woman from Chaozhou, through a matchmaker in Shanghai last summer. After their marriage, the couple lived together at 11 Dahua Lane, Route Cardinal Mercier, in the French Concession. Because the new couple could not communicate well and their feelings waned, Zhang soon left and never returned.

### Tenant Sues Landlord for Obstructing Freedom: Landlord Uses Various Means to Force Tenants to Relocate; Tenant Lists Facts and Charges the Due Crimes

Shen Shilin, a resident of Balle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, was recently sued by Zhang Liangen, Zhang Quangen, Xu Heshang, and others, who hired lawyer Xu Wufang to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court for obstructing freedom and committing theft in a group of three or more, requesting that they be punished for the crimes under Articles 321, Section 4, 304, Section 1, and 306, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. The facts of the complaint are that the plaintiffs are tenants of the defendant, Shen Shilin, and since Zhang Liangen rented 33, Lane 977, Tokyo Road, Chen Quangen rented number 35, and Xu Heshang rented number 37, they have

not had any disputes

Recently, due to the outbreak of war, there is a shortage of housing in the concession, and the defendant demanded a rent increase. The plaintiffs had already agreed to increase the rent once. Recently, someone was willing to pay a large sum of removal fees and pay high rent to rent the above-mentioned houses from the defendant. The defendant was blinded by greed and forced the plaintiffs to relocate at all costs. After polite negotiation, they were willing to increase the rent further, but the defendant said that increasing the rent was a secondary issue and that they must first pay a removal fee of 300 yuan per household. The plaintiffs believed that after so many years of being guests and hosts, there was no need to talk about removal fees and unanimously refused. The defendant then, starting from the end of the waste lunar calendar this year, refused to collect rent.

The plaintiffs were afraid that they would use the excuse of unpaid rent to sue for eviction, so they deposited the rent due with the court. Seeing that there was no opportunity to take advantage, the defendant resorted to extraordinary means. At first, he used his relative, Shen, who worked at the fire brigade, to threaten Zhang Liangen, saying that his residence was used for an uncooperative factory. After a reasoned protest, the matter ended there. On May 3rd this year, the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department summoned Zhang for talks, ordered the defendant to report that Zhang's woodworking had disrupted the peace and order, and the section instructed Zhang to prepare a letter stating that the workshop would be cleaned up and closed. The defendant, out of options, led more than 30 workers and more than 10 hooligans on the roof at 3:05 PM on May 4th, removing the tiles and overturning boxes and cabinets. Seeing that the situation was not good, Zhang and Chen Quangen reported to the Putuo Road police station and summoned a photographer. The defendants then scattered in a panic. When they investigated, they were gone. Afterward, it was discovered that 260 yuan in cash, 15 yuan in change, and a work pass were lost from the accounting room. The next day, they also reported to the police station. The defendant's actions constituted a violation of the criminal law and should be punished according to regulations. The civil lawsuit is temporarily reserved.

and requested a preliminary investigation of the records of the Putuo Road police station on May 4th. This case was heard in the Criminal Court Three by Judge Jiang Shuzi at 10:00 AM yesterday. The plaintiffs entrusted lawyer Xu Wufang to represent them in court, and the defendant also appeared in court with his defense lawyer. As a result, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing at 10:00 AM on the 27th.

The person delivering the money was required to carry a hatbox and a tin of cigarettes. The letters also stated that if the matter was reported to the police, the entire family would be killed or a bomb would be thrown.

Furthermore, the letters stated that the squad had previously attempted to borrow 2,000 yuan from Yu Daxiong, a fellow businessman, but he had refused to pay and had taken refuge in the New Asia Hotel in Hongkou, under the protection of a foreigner. As a result, the brothers of the squad secretly went to the hotel and killed him. Weng Longyuan ignored the letters. Unexpectedly, another letter arrived on the 21st, stating that the tea shop he had established was a front and that an investigation had revealed that it was a drug trafficking organization. The letter demanded 500 yuan and ordered that someone be sent to No. 2, Ximen Road in the French Concession on the morning of the 22nd to

discuss the matter in a teahouse.

Otherwise, drastic measures would be taken. Weng Longyuan, unable to bear being harassed by these people, reported the situation to the Huijia Police Station. At approximately 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, Weng sent his representative, Lu Boyin, carrying a hatbox and cigarettes as instructed, along with Wang Youshan, a Chinese detective from the police station, to the French Police Station to meet with Chinese and foreign detectives and set up an ambush at the designated location to observe the situation. Lu Boyin

was wandering around Baixing Road.

After a while, Gao Yongkang, a 42-year-old native of Jiangyin, arrived and asked him if he was a representative of Mr. Weng. Lu said yes, and Gao invited him to negotiate in another small teahouse. Detective Wang then followed them into the teahouse and arrested Gao. Upon interrogation, it was learned that Gao lived at No. 36, Washington Road in the French Concession. An investigation revealed that there was no Wang Bin or anyone else there. He was then

taken back to the police station

and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution for attempted extortion under Article 314, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law and requested a postponement. The defendant, Gao Yongkang, admitted that he had written the two letters but gave evasive answers to the other charges and pleaded for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.

### Bankruptcy Case of the Puhai Bank, Ministry Orders Recovery, Bank Not Registered, Business Operations Unknown

The Puhai Bank quietly ceased operations, owing over three hundred thousand in deposits. Creditor representatives, including Li Jingyan, retained lawyers at Liewu and Co. to sue in court. A judgment was obtained for full repayment, and appeals were made to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is now known that the Puhai Bank has not complied with the judgment for repayment and has applied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for a settlement and requested approval from the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has not approved the request because the bank has not registered in accordance with the law. Yesterday, the Ministry telegraphed the bank's creditor group, instructing them to pursue recovery through the courts again in accordance with the law. The telegram reads as follows: "Telegram received. Regarding the Minxing Puhai Commercial Bank, on December 7th of last year, it submitted a report to the Ministry stating that due to the expansion of the war, cash reserves were dwindling, and loan collections were difficult, forcing the Shanghai office to temporarily suspend payments, leading to litigation. A court judgment was obtained for full repayment. After consultation with the depositor-plaintiffs, an understanding was reluctantly reached. It is estimated that currently available and convertible funds amount to 30% of the total deposits, which will be paid out equally starting from December 1st of this year. A request for approval was submitted, to which we responded, 'Upon investigation, the establishment of the bank has not been reported to the Ministry for registration in accordance with the law, nor has it been registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Therefore, the Ministry has no way of knowing the daily business operations. After the Shanghai office of the bank suspended operations, the amounts owed to depositors have been fully repaid by court judgment, and the bank should comply with the judgment properly.' The instructions have been issued. The reporting party should continue to pursue the debt in accordance with the law. This is the instruction."

### Shanghai Municipal Council Resolves to Increase the Price of Park Season Tickets to Three Yuan Each

The first meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Works Committee was held on the 15th of this month. Committee member Okamoto was elected as Chairman. Among the important cases discussed and resolved was one concerning the price of park tickets. The details are as follows:

Last year, someone proposed to the Works Committee that the price of park tickets be increased. The reason given was that the number of visitors to Zhaofeng Park was increasing daily, and there was a risk of damage to the park's facilities. This proposal was subsequently rejected. At that time, the Committee did not change the price of Zhaofeng Park tickets. Now, since last year, the number of visitors to Zhaofeng Park has more than doubled. The aforementioned proposal to increase the price of tickets has been brought up for discussion again. According to the records, the daily number of visitors to Zhaofeng Park before the end of May each year has been the highest this year in the last five years. According to the records for the previous four years, the highest number of visitors was 19,417 on May 29, 1937, while this year on April 30, there were as many as 36,573 people.

The Director of the Municipal Council's Works Department said that with so many visitors to Zhaofeng Park, it is easy for people to hide in various places, which often leads to theft of the park's property and valuable plants. Moreover, large groups of visitors often trample on flowers and plants, pull chairs, and generally disregard park rules. Various debris are thrown around indiscriminately, which is detrimental to the appearance of the park. Although waste bins have been added and warning signs erected, it is feared that it will not be possible to maintain cleanliness this summer due to the large number of visitors. The purpose of the Council in selling park tickets is to prevent visitors from entering the park at will and causing damage, not to increase revenue. However, the current ticket price is obviously too low, so that it cannot achieve the above purpose. The price of season tickets for parks in the French Concession is as high as 2.2 yuan. Therefore, it is proposed that the ticket prices be revised as follows: Season tickets valid for all parks, 3 yuan per year; Season tickets valid for all parks except Zhaofeng Park, 1 yuan per year. Most of the park visitors are middle-class Chinese, and the proposed revised prices are only the price of fifteen temporary tickets, which should be affordable for them. If anyone considers the cost to be too high, they can purchase a 1 yuan season ticket and visit Jiaozhou Park and the Bund Park.

The committee members had different opinions on this case. Some argued that the price should not be increased, while others believed that the proposed revised prices were reasonable. If approved and implemented, it could disperse visitors. As a result, a slight majority voted in favor of it. It was resolved to recommend to the Board of Directors that the prices be revised as above, starting from June 1st of this year, when the sale of this year's season tickets begins. When the Board of Directors considered this case, it discussed it in more detail. Some members suggested that the price of Zhaofeng Park season tickets be raised to four or five yuan, and that it could be reduced to the original price when the population of the city returns to normal. In this way, residents can understand that the Council is not increasing the ticket price because it wants to increase revenue. After discussing this case, the Board of Directors passed the recommendation of the Works Committee (the price of Zhaofeng Park temporary tickets remains the same).

The directors believed that increasing the price of Zhaofeng Park tickets alone was not enough to prevent damage. In order to fully achieve the goal, it is necessary to simultaneously strengthen management by staff and special police officers within the possible scope. On the one hand, visitors should be advised to abide by the rules and respect public interests. As for Jiaozhou Park, it may be that the traffic is inconvenient, resulting in fewer visitors. Therefore, the Council should contact the bus companies and tram companies to find ways to make it easier for visitors to travel to the park.

### Finance: Gold Flows Back Out of the Market; Depreciation of Yen and Various Banknotes Demonstrates Stability of Legal Tender; Why Hoard Gold?

Yesterday, the local cash gold spot market, after an initial rise, turned to a decline, receding close to the 2,110 yuan level. Initially, under the continued dumping by the securities firm De Fu (representing the northern merchant group), silver firms (representing local wealthy merchants) and a certain gold shop (representing the southern Chinese merchant group) jointly competed to buy, leading to a stable and firm trend in the morning. However, in light of the sharp fall of the yen, which reflected the precious and stable nature of Chinese legal tender, the naturally weak market sentiment led to a sudden decline in the afternoon amid selling pressure from money changers, ultimately falling past the previous level by another yuan. The price of jewelry gold remained unchanged, while the price of pure gold from Britain and China suddenly saw a slight decline, and the price of customs gold remained stable.

Spot Gold Market Down One Yuan

From the morning, although a certain silver shop, acting for wealthy individuals, frequently absorbed gold, the sellers were also willing to supply, resulting in a relatively stable market. Initially, a certain silver shop successively absorbed 100 taels each from money changers and securities firms, with the opening price at 2,115 yuan, 2 yuan higher than the previous closing price. After that, securities firms sold 50 taels to silver firms at 14 yuan. At that time, a certain Yu store (representing the southern Chinese merchant group) came to absorb purchases again, with money changers, cash shops, and securities firms each selling 50 taels at 15 yuan. Later, a certain money changer suddenly came to buy again, and then raised the price by one yuan, with the money changer buying 50 taels each from a certain shop and a securities firm, with price being same. Subsequently, a certain gold shop absorbed 50 taels from money changers, at the same price. After this, supply and demand became scarce, and the market fell silent, with the closing price at noon still at 16 yuan. In the afternoon, money changers (representing retail investors) had a strong intention to sell, and buyers were rare, so the market suddenly turned weak, with the opening price immediately falling by 4 yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels to a gold shop at 12 yuan, and later the same money changers sold another 50 taels to the gold shop at the same price. After this, supply and demand became scarce, and the closing price in the evening remained at 2,112 yuan, a further decline of one yuan compared to the previous night's close. The spread for cash shops was 2,117-8 yuan when selling and 2,107-8 yuan when buying. The current price of gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and no trading took place.

Jewelry Gold Remains at Original Price

The exchange price per tael for jewelry gold at silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang still listed the original price of 215 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang listed 213 yuan for selling and 207 yuan for buying.

British Pure Gold Falls by Half a Penny

### Foreign Exchange: Both Spot and Futures Trading are Active; Foreign Firms are Settling Accounts; Japanese Merchants Briefly Turned to Selling

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw active competition to buy from companies such as British American Tobacco, Asiatic Petroleum, and Standard Oil, with E Lee (representing the Tianjin merchant group) also following suit. However, Chinese banks and Chinese cotton yarn merchants frequently dumped and sold, and Japanese banks also briefly sold. Additionally, foreign banks were also willing to supply, resulting in a balance between supply and demand. Both spot and futures prices saw little change, and the results were inconclusive. Trading throughout the day was still active. The Hong Kong exchange rate initially showed some strength, but then money changers frequently bought without ceasing, so it returned to flat, and ultimately there were no gains or losses.

In the morning, the London exchange rate for both near and distant futures returned to 0.0625. The New York silver price remained unchanged. The price of raw gold in London fell by half a penny. The exchange rates of the British pound against the US dollar, the Shanghai yuan, and the French franc were all flat. The US dollar rose by 0.0125 against the British pound and remained unchanged against the Shanghai yuan and the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices for spot exchange rates at banks in the morning were 8.25 pence for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, with no gains or losses compared to the previous close. After the opening, British American Tobacco suddenly bought HSBC spot exchange for the British pound for August delivery, with the price ranging from 8.25 pence to 8.125 pence. Subsequently, Standard Oil also bought spot exchange from American banks for the US dollar for August delivery, with the price ranging from 16.0625 yuan to 15.875 yuan. Because supply and demand corresponded, there was a lack of change. When the HSBC list was announced to be unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be 2.5%, calculated as 5.50%, a certain broker, representing a Japanese bank, sold to E Lee's bank British pounds for June delivery at 8.21875 pence. Subsequently, Chinese cotton yarn merchants also sold US dollars for August delivery to Banque Belge pour l'Etranger in China and Deutsch-Asiatische Bank at 15.875 yuan. Later, Asiatic Petroleum bought British pounds for August delivery from Banque Belge pour l'Etranger in China at 8.125 pence, and the market trend remained relatively stable. Nearing noon, there was only trading in the Hong Kong exchange rate. Guangdong and overseas Chinese banks successively sold spot exchange to money changers at prices of 55.25 yuan and 55.125 yuan, and the situation was still flat. The selling prices for spot exchange at banks at noon were the same as the morning opening prices for the British pound and the US dollar, and 55.125 yuan for the Hong Kong dollar.

In the afternoon, E Lee (representing the Tianjin merchant group) first settled spot British pounds with HSBC at 8.25 pence. Subsequently, foreign firms settled spot US dollars with a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan. Later, cotton yarn merchants sold US dollars for August delivery to Banca Italiana per la China at 15.875 yuan. After this, foreign firms again absorbed Dutch British pounds for August delivery at 8.125 pence. Subsequently, Chinese banks sold US dollars for June delivery to Anderson Meyer at 16 yuan. Therefore, spot and futures prices remained little changed. Later, foreign firms again bought spot Hong Kong dollars from Guangdong Chinese banks at a price of 55.125 yuan, for a stable situation. Until the evening close, the selling prices for spot exchange at banks were 8.25 pence for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the evening close of the previous day, spot and futures prices were all flat, and the final selling price for Hong Kong dollars at banks was still 55.125 yuan, and there were also no increases or decreases.

### Although Foreign Currencies Mostly Declined Slightly, the Depreciation of Japanese Banknotes Was Especially Severe; They Rose to 0.9 Jiao in the Morning, But Began to Decline in the Afternoon; Consolidated Notes Continued to Fall

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the exchange rate between British pounds and US dollars remained unchanged. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were settling accounts heavily. Companies such as British American Tobacco, Standard Oil, and Asiatic Petroleum absorbed a great deal. Banks outside the settlement were supplied smoothly, such as Japanese banks, cotton yarn merchants, etc., dumping was quite powerful, so market prices were stable and lacking change. The gold spot market opened, and gold shops had strong speculative interest, and the market situation was firm. The mid-course wave was very slight, and in the afternoon, gold shops and money changers dumped very intently, the market situation was weak. As a result, it fell slightly compared to the previous day. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, retail investors supplied quite a lot, and the trading of British and American gold notes was very active, but the demand was relatively scarce. The demand for Hong Kong dollar notes and French franc notes was not strong, and the supply of Annam notes and Canadian notes was more smooth, all seeing slight looseness and slight declines. Only the demand for Dutch customs notes, Italian notes, Australian gold notes, and Siamese notes increased slightly, and the shape rose slightly. The Japanese gold notes and Korean notes had a very soft market situation in the morning, and prices continued to fall miserably. The market was very chaotic, and sales were opened at 0.88 yuan and 0.89 yuan. Most of them were sold by Japanese merchants, showing their own instability. Small money shops also dared not hoard them, and followed the trend of selling and buying, to avoid taking risks. In the afternoon, there was a slight turnaround, and the closing price was 0.91 yuan, and new banknotes were 0.81 yuan. Yesterday, the guild opened the prices of various currencies, British and American gold pounds all fell by 0.1 yuan, British gold notes fell by 0.02 yuan, US gold notes fell by 0.005 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by 0.001 yuan, French franc notes fell by 0.0075 yuan, Dutch notes rose by 0.01 yuan, Annam notes fell by 0.02 yuan, Canadian notes fell by 0.005 yuan, Italian notes rose by 0.005 yuan, Australian gold notes rose by 0.1 yuan, Siamese notes rose by 0.05 yuan, and other currencies all remained unchanged.

### Tianjin Applications for Exchange Continue to be Small; Hong Kong Exchange Market is Stable

London, 12th. There were few purchases in the silver market from India, and supply was limited. The market was flat, and remained flat after the close. The metal market provided a slight supply at the listed price. The British silver rate for near and distant futures both returned to 0.0625. According to a New York silver telegram, the spot price remained unchanged. Also, according to a Bombay telegram, the Indian silver price was calm, and both near and distant futures rose by one anna.

### Call Loan Rate Returns to One Jiao

It once fell as low as 49.25 yuan per 1,000 yuan, slightly rebounded to 49.5 yuan at noon, and continued to rise to 49.75 yuan at the end, which was the same as the previous day's price. The call loan rate in the money market has returned to a little more than one fen, estimated to be about one jiao.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Decline Slightly

British and French Bonds Fall by Three Pounds

Jardine Matheson Shares See the Most Trading

The securities gray market yesterday gradually weakened, with the long positions of large investors showing signs of wavering. In the afternoon, there were even rumors that the Tianjin concession was about to be surrounded, and the trend became even more discouraging. Most of those who bought in the morning turned to selling, and the situation changed. However, large changes are still pending. In the morning, Hong Da, Xie Da, Lian He, and Gong Mao all made purchases, and Heng Fu also covered a small number of short positions. The opening prices were extremely firm, but then Tian Sheng, Yuan Tong Kang, and others came out to sell at high prices, and Fu Chun, Qia Feng, and No. 41 followed suit and sold late, and the market prices fell back. In the afternoon, due to rumors of trouble in Tianjin, and that the so-called loan was completely fictitious, the floating long positions rushed to sell, and the market prices fell by 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. The total turnover for the day was more than 500,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

### Stock Market Prices; 50 shares of Chinese Securities Exchange were traded, with a price of 30.02 yuan.

The public hall stock market was stagnant, and the trading of Jardine Matheson shares was the most extensive. The price of Kailan Mining Administration shares was 29 yuan, the price of Gong He Xiang shares was 209 yuan, and the price of telephone shares was 103.5 yuan. Although the above three items saw new highs again, trading was not extensive. Due to the rise in the price of Kailan Mining Administration shares, cultivation shares also saw buyers at 8 yuan, and there were few sellers. Jardine Matheson's share offering was stable, with a price of 181.7 yuan.

The characteristic of rubber is that British stocks have been reduced by another 1,044 tons, and are now calculated to be 64,933 tons. Based on the highest number of stocks on September 3 of last year, which was 99,725 tons, it has fallen by as much as 35,000 tons to date. Although the stock market is not very active at present, many people demand various stocks, and rubber trust shares saw a turnover of 4.25 yuan. On the 22nd of this month (Monday), the listed market prices of London British Far East companies' shares were as follows: coal shares rose and fell slightly, with the Kailan Mining Administration shares rising by 1.5 pence, with a price of 19 shillings and 7.5 pence, and the Korean Coal Mining shares falling by 6 pence, with a price of 5 shillings. There were no other changes.

On the 22nd of this month (Monday), the listed market prices of London Chinese foreign prices saw very limited increases and decreases. The Hukuang Railway Bonds (Vickers bonds) rose by 0.5 pounds, with a price of 22.5 pounds. The Crisp Loan Bonds fell slightly by 5 shillings, with a price of 35 pounds and 15 shillings. However, it was reported that the British and French loans and bonds might fall by 4 pounds, and the new price should be 57 pounds. There were no other changes. There was a demand to sell actual goods in London, and the railway bonds were not deserted. 10,000 pounds of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Loan (British-issued Chinese bonds) were sold at 18 pounds and 9 shillings, a slight increase of 5 shillings according to the market. 5,000 pounds of the Longhai Railway Bonds were sold at 18.5 pounds, at market price. 4,000 pounds of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds (drawn shares) were sold at 26.5 pounds, an increase of one pound according to the market. 15,000 pounds of the Hukuang Railway Bonds (Vickers bonds, undrawn) were sold at 20.5 pounds, at market price. Also, Feakes airplane bonds were quoted at 17 pounds and 15 shillings, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds were quoted at 19 pounds and 15 shillings, and it is hoped that they can be purchased.

### Cotton Yarn: Market Loses Regularity; Yarn Prices Vary Greatly; 20-Count Golden Hair Brand Price is Unusually Low; Single Coarse Yarn and Double-Strand Thread Have Best Sales

The yarn market continued to advance, because customer sales were untiring, and demand from Hong Kong was prosperous, so people's hearts were cheered. Upon investigation, most of the counts purchased were 32-count single yarn and 42-count double-strand thread, and 10-count coarse yarn was also not bad. However, there were fewer transactions of 20-count yarn, so the price of 32-count and 42-count yarn rose fiercely, and the price of 10-count coarse yarn was determined. The price of 20-count yarn was smooth. As for the unpopular goods among 20-count yarn, not only could they not advance sharply, but they also felt that they were lagging behind. As a result, the price difference became wider and wider, which was actually because business was too clear. In the afternoon, the prices of the Sky Girl and Double Horse brands declined slightly by two or three yuan, and the unpopular goods increased by one yuan, but the number of transactions decreased, because some profit takers had already come out. However, according to the market, 20-count Dafa yarn was only sold for 388 yuan, and 20-count Golden Rooster had no sales, and the market price was unusually low. This kind of scene showed that the market state varied greatly.

In the current yarn situation, the market opened strong in the morning, and the market momentum continued to advance from the previous day, and most people's opinions were optimistic. Upon inquiry, the southern Chinese and Hong Kong-Shantou groups still had actual transactions, and the holders' intentions were firm, and the opening price was raised by 0.5 yuan to 1 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipts was 422 yuan, and the same group bought 15 packages, and the price of goods from foreign warehouses was 430 yuan. The Hong Kong group absorbed a little, and soon the Shantou and Hong Kong groups searched the market for 32-count and 42-count yarn and thread in large numbers, and the selling price jumped by 5 yuan to 7 or 8 yuan. So 20-count yarn also moved up a step, and Double Horse reached 433 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price reached 425 yuan. By the time of the close, it had slightly returned by 1 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation was still firm for 32-count and 42-count, but 20-count yarn showed signs of fatigue, and Double Horse spot goods fell by 2 yuan, to 428 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 422.5 yuan. An investigation of the total amount purchased by each group throughout the day showed 2,135 packages. The market was sluggish, Double Horse fell by 0.5 yuan, and Sky Girl fell by 3 yuan, but Double Earth rose by 7 yuan, 10-count coarse yarn also rose by 1 or 2 yuan, Shepherd rose by 3 yuan, 32-count rose by 5 yuan, and 42-count rose by 5.5 yuan. Today, 380 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 17 pieces to Xiamen, 1,230 pieces to Shantou, and 1,000 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each group is listed below: Same industry 970, Hong Kong 760, Shantou 35, Mainland 15, Yunnan 7, total 2,1555.

The Japanese yarn market was firm in the morning, fell at the close, and was flat in the afternoon, but actual demand was not strong, because Japanese merchants and foreign firms directly transported and sold the yarn, and the transactions of general traders were greatly discounted. The closing price of 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month was 355 yuan, which was about the same as the previous day.

### The Situation of Local Cotton is Difficult; Foreign Cotton Trading is Also a Dead Market

In the foreign cotton market, at the beginning of the New York cotton market, the price fell by 2 to 5 points due to the decline reported by Liverpool. The price of cotton for July delivery had already risen to the price set for the release of loan cotton, so the long positions were in a state of panic, fearing the release of loan cotton, and they closed out their positions, so the prices of near-term and spot goods alone fell by 3 points, and the rest all rose by 4 points. The prices of Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by half a rupee, and the price of Egyptian cotton fell by 10 points. The legal tender cotton prices all fell, and the price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 0.2 yuan per picul, the price of Indian cotton fell by 0.2 yuan, and the price of Egyptian cotton fell by 0.6 yuan.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was extremely quiet for all manufacturers, and the trading of foreign cotton has become a dead market in recent days. According to various forecasts, if the overseas cotton market does not report a decline, the trading of foreign cotton will be quiet for at least several weeks. The factory price of Nan Shi converted yesterday is as follows:

The business of local cotton slightly improved, but a large amount of consumption was still lacking, and the purchase of the same industry was just a decoration, and the factory's needs were still lagging, and they were mostly thinking about purchasing and supplementing foreign cotton. However, the local cotton inventory was becoming shorter day by day, and the source was scarce. According to this situation, the situation of Chinese cotton was difficult. The source of northern Jiangsu was 140 packages of Tongzhou flower and 600 pieces of wooden frame flower. Also, 154 pieces of cotton came from Beisha. Today, there were still 20 pieces shipped to Shantou. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

### Piece Goods: The Trend of Cotton Yarn and Cloth is Still Good; The Selling Price of Cloth is Also Stable

Summer Goods are Selling Well in Time

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, the sales of cloth were still more prosperous in the Zhejiang and Guangdong groups and the business on this street, and the rest of the areas were in a sluggish state. The selling price of each cloth was stable due to the firm trend of cotton yarn, and the price was also slightly different. The Wenzhou group searched most strongly for all grades of white goods, coarse cloth, and light and heavy pounds of goods produced by the Yihe factory, and more than 100 packages were traded. Fine cloth, fine twill, Dapeng, Fugui, and Jinfeng brands sold more than 80 pieces. The price of fine twill from this factory continued to be low, and it was already in line with the Dongpi factory. More than 100 pieces were purchased by the dyeing factory on this street. The wholesale stores on this street purchased more than 100 pieces of Fuling striped Su silk, ramie cloth, white calico, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and other goods. The Guangdong group continued to purchase nearly 100 pieces of fine cloth, colored twill, colored cloth, Su silk, and other goods. The demand from the Tianjin group in the north was very sluggish, and the Sichuan and Yunnan groups had difficulty in delivering goods, and the new purchases were reduced.

Eastern Cloth The selling prices of fine cloth and fine twill remained unchanged yesterday, but the price of fine cloth for futures delivery continued to increase by 0.1 yuan. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head for next month's delivery was 13.75 yuan per piece. The customer groups traded sparsely, and the dyeing factories and colleagues on this street purchased 810 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill because they were optimistic about the future.

Exports Today, 140 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, 85 pieces to Yantai, 40 pieces to Xiamen, 555 pieces to Shantou, and 95 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Summer Woolen Fabrics Sell Exceptionally Well

The demand for summer woolen fabrics has been gradually increasing in both Chinese and Western clothing recently. Among the fabrics purchased by the street door and city groups yesterday, Palis was the most popular, followed by feathers yarn and light-colored thin floral fabric. The Western clothing groups were most popular with feather yarn, Wanliding, Luo Si Ni, Fat Pi Chu, Ba Le Ni, white drill, white straight tribute, white canvas, and other fabrics. The women's clothing groups purchased cheaper flannel and feather yarn more often, and the cheapest white drill was suitable, because most of the women's spring and summer coats only cost more than 10 yuan each. Yellow twill has been selling well and the standard is continuing to rise. Three-day Vienna velvet is still sold at 5.85 yuan per yard, but both arrival and sales are lacking. Luo gauze only has sporadic transactions. Domestic white lining and white calico have a very wide sales field, and the output is not enough to meet sales. The main street market has improved by 0.025 yuan compared to the previous day. The main reason is that the Japanese wide-width canvas has no successor after the batch, and there is a trend of stock-out, and the cost is soaring due to the high price of the original yarn. Buyers need to use domestic goods to replace them. Yesterday, 36-inch wide-width No. 1 was sold at 0.9 yuan per yard, No. 2 was 0.85 yuan, 28-inch narrow-width was 0.675 yuan, and white lining was 0.62 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise Greatly; Factory Exports to Europe Increase Sharply

Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai, because New York was rising sharply, made a big deal of trading. The export of White Factory XB grade French silk was active, and the Golden Monkey grade was opened at 1,820 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. The Seven Stars Thirteen to Fifteen stripes were sold at a high price of 2,000 yuan, which can be called the unprecedented record of the export market price after the war. Yesterday, the export of European silk, Xinfu, Kaili, Renchang, Dafeng, and Dachang all reported excitement, so the turnover reached more than 200 packages. The silk for American exports is still waiting for an opportunity to launch. Yesterday, the market had no incoming accounts, so there was no current talk, only a telegram to New York. The sale of Indian silk was also lively yesterday. Xiang Ji, Meida, and Baisheng and other companies bought 50 dan of Ji Li Xia Gan, the market price rose by 10 yuan, and it was sold at 860 yuan.

In the foreign silk market, yesterday suddenly turned to a rise, and New York spot goods soared by 0.11 yuan, and the quick period rose by 0.055 yuan. Japanese silk spot goods each rose by 0.07 yuan, Shanghai silk rose by 0.07 yuan and 0.08 yuan. Since it is the end of the month, the situation of speculative rolling spot in the foreign silk industry will reappear. Yokohama spot goods reopened at 1,300 yuan yesterday, up 12 yuan, and the forward period was down 9 yuan.

There were 75 pieces of tea shipped to Qingdao today.

### Food: Factory Flour Temporarily Defends Original Plate; Foreign Flour Continues to Depreciate

Factory Flour Yesterday, the flour market was once again flat. The sales of the Beiyang group had been slightly volatile after the depreciation, with a total of 50,000 to 60,000 packages being traded. However, at present, although the transportation and sales in North China are still passable, due to the impact of the cheap competitive sales of foreign flour, customers dare not buy more. The Tianjin group purchased 30,000 to 40,000 packages of foreign flour a few days ago, which has not yet been loaded, so the demand for factory flour suddenly lacked interest. The factory was indifferent to this environment, and had no intention to compromise again, and as a result, temporarily defended the original plate, waiting for the opportunity. The total market transaction between this customer was more than 30,000 packages, No. 2 flour was still 4.4 yuan in cash and 4.6 yuan in exchange settlement, and the Pao Che and Maigen were still separately reduced by 0.05 yuan.

Foreign Flour After the spot foreign flour market repeatedly depreciated, it has attracted the attention of the Tianjin group. The Tianjin group purchased more than 30,000 packages at an exchange settlement of 4.5 yuan, and the goods party feared that the factory flour would depreciate again, and it was reported that a ship would arrive on June 1, with an estimated 100,000 packages, so there was a possibility of loosening the price by 0.05 yuan. However, the customer's stomach felt full, and the sales of powder in North China after a long period of quiet were still in the trial stage, and there was no hope of continuing a whole batch of transactions for a while, so the market maintained a holding state. It was heard that the popular brands of retail sales on this street still required 4.4 yuan in cash.

Exports Today, 14,000 packages of flour are being shipped to Tianjin, 4,500 packages to Shantou, and another 300 packages of bran to Hong Kong and 500 packages to Shantou. 100 packages of beans are being shipped to Xiamen.

### Although the Inventory is Sufficient, the Situation of Japonica Rice is as Before

Yesterday, the sources of various groups arrived at Songjiang Nan (South Jiangsu) groups 6 and 7, the Wheel and Steam buns, the Su Tong Kunshan and other groups 4,200 to 4,300 packages. In the general market, the opening in the morning was still flat, and then the appetite of this street turned active, and the groups also pulled in japonica rice, so the situation gradually tightened, and the shouting sound rose again. However, the result was only a few minutes to 0.1 yuan better for the thick and thin japonica market, as there were quite a few chips on the market, and the high common japonica opened at 17.7 yuan, presenting a state of hovering. A lot of foreign sharp rice arrived, and the high price caused the market to feel fatigued instead, and the foreign sharp rice at Dushan continued to be the same as before. The customer sharp rice arrived continuously, and people had no intention to buy more, so the price came to see an increase or decrease, and the change was due to the influence of foreign glutinous rice, and continued to decrease by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan.

### Foreign Rice is Definitely Settled; Customer Shops and Traders are All Seeking to Sell

Although the spot sales of customer Xian rice were active yesterday, the customer heart has been affected by foreign rice orders, and the retailers and customer traders mostly sought to sell. Therefore, after supporting the morning market for a while, it immediately tended to fatigue. Moreover, the current inventory is sufficient, and the source continues to arrive, so the later market is still weak. After a batch of foreign rice orders was settled, a telegram of 19.23 yuan was sent out again yesterday, but it is difficult to predict whether it can be settled. However, the current foreign rice base is not small, and the selling price is not willing to be suppressed, and there is a lot of foreign glutinous rice in stock, so the price continued to be cut by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan.

### Oil Cakes. Japanese Currency Falls, Oil Cake Market Depressed

With the continual devaluation of soybean old futures, the Dalian oil cake market has been greatly affected. Yesterday, soybean oil trading was stagnant, and prices fell by four dimes. A total of 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at a price of 39 yuan and six dimes, and 50 barrels of Fengnian oil were traded at a price of 39 yuan.

Soybean Cake: Recent spot sales have been affected by chemical fertilizers. (It is said that farmers in the interior, due to unfavorable conditions, dare not openly purchase soybean cake. Chemical fertilizers are easier to pack and store in paper bags, making sales more active.) This has led to a pessimistic outlook. Spot cakes from Dalian Yuanji have fallen to 2.82 to 2.88 yuan, with only 3,000 pieces traded. Futures cakes initially recovered by 7-8 cents in the morning, but experienced considerable fluctuations afterward. They briefly touched the bottom in the afternoon, recovering by 2-3 cents, but remained unstable. The closing price fell by more than a dime compared to the previous day. A total of over 10,000 pieces of assorted brand cakes for June were traded at a price of 2.85 to 2.81 yuan. Yuanji cake futures for 15,000 pieces were traded at a price from 2.8875 yuan to 2.85 yuan.

Exports: Today, 300 pieces of soybean cake were exported to Xiamen.

### Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar, Re-export Goods Fall by Half a Yuan

Yesterday, raw and white sugar prices, according to London telegraph, rebounded and fell again. August fell 3.5 pence to 6 shillings and 10.5 pence; December fell 1.5 pence to 6 shillings and 1 penny; March of next year fell by the same amount to 6 shillings and 1.5 pence. Dutch telegrams indicated no change in the near term, with a slight increase in the long term. July-August CIF (KG) was 9.35 Dutch guilders; September-October was 8.50. The local guildhall, influenced by the London price decline, saw a sudden softening trend. Spot prices for second-grade raw and white sugar from local warehouses fell by 3 dimes to 27.2 yuan; foreign warehouse goods fell by 4 dimes to 27 yuan. Re-export goods were traded at 18.8 yuan for 300 bags, a drop of half a yuan. Taikoo refined sugar also fell slightly by 2 cents: B mark was 26.8 yuan, CW mark 26.6 yuan, CX mark 26.4 yuan, DY mark 26 yuan, HX mark 25.8 yuan. Dutch red, army red, and local cotton white sugar showed little change. National sugar sales were limited and relatively stable, but further declines are possible if large quantities are offered.

### Sundry Goods: Lychee Flower Buds Show Poor Signs

According to a letter from Guangdong, lychee flower buds are not flourishing this year, and a poor harvest is expected. According to a letter from Zhangzhou, orchids and bamboo are also reduced compared to last year, but "Wu Ye" lychees are expected to be better.

### International Sugar Conference: Approves Re-Allocation

According to a London telegram, the International Sugar Industry Conference issued a communiqué on (the 20th), stating that the Executive Committee's proposal for re-allocating the quotas reduced in July 1938 among various countries, totaling 239,000 metric tons, had been put to a vote. Out of 95 votes, 80 were in favor, so the re-allocation method is now effective. The re-allocation method is listed below (unit: metric tons): Cuba 72,511; Dominican Republic 20,730; Haiti 2,170; Dutch East Indies 62,606; Soviet Union 65,956; Australia 7,500; South Africa 7,000.

The Executive Committee also proposed allowing British dominions and colonies to increase this year's quota by 153,255 metric tons, which received 75 votes in favor, with only two representatives against. This matter is being handled by telegram. It is reported that the Administrative Council will convene another meeting in early June to specifically address this matter.

### Metals: Plain Galvanized Iron, Gradual Turnaround

Recently, due to a shortage of plain galvanized iron arrivals and low production at local factories, the sales situation has improved significantly. Currently, 6-foot sheets are selling for 2.4 yuan per sheet, and 7-foot sheets are selling for 3 yuan, an increase of 1-2 dimes and 3-4 dimes respectively compared to the previous market. Construction contractors in this city have purchased the most, with some purchases also from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places. Yesterday, the market saw a total of 200 bundles purchased, but there is still a large amount of inventory in circulation, preventing a supply-demand imbalance.

### Coal: Japanese Coal, Discounted Dumping

Recently, the Japanese coal business has been difficult to standardize due to the sharp decline in the Japanese currency. Many small dealers have excessive inventory and are eager to sell, forcing them to offer discounted dumping. This has led to price chaos, with prices falling by 9 dimes to 1 yuan per ton. Yesterday, a certain firm sold 200 tons of Hokkaido coal, screened lump coal at 35 yuan per ton, and mixed coal at 34.25 yuan, delivered from Pudong foreign warehouses, with handling fees borne by the buyer.

Charcoal: Yesterday, 26,720 bundles arrived from Wenzhou.

### Talking About Mr. Wu Mei

— Gai

Hearing the news of Mr. Wu Mei's death, and also reading many memorial articles, I couldn't help but want to write a little about my "fate" with him.

However, what I write may be disappointing, because I have never met him even once. The so-called "fate" is just my one-sided view.

It has been more than ten years. When Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou was just established, the Faculty of Arts was planning to hire a new batch of professors, and Mr. Wu's name was one I proposed, intending to invite him to teach "History of Chinese Opera." At the time, I was a bit ambitious, wanting to recruit as many scholars I knew as possible to Guangdong. Guangdong was then considered the birthplace of new national talents, and I myself was one of those who were enthusiastic about this "birthplace." I always felt it was a pity that many thoughtful scholars were still gathered in Beijing, which, although a "cultural city," was actually outdated. This kind of overreaching ambition is, of course, laughable now, but at the time, it really stemmed from a sincere intention. I think I had already sent out a letter, and at the same time, I entrusted someone to ask Mr. Wu about his intentions. But later I learned that Mr. Wu had left Beijing long ago and had been teaching at Southeast University for several years. I don't remember exactly what happened, but the matter was shelved, and there was no follow-up.

I had read Mr. Wu's creations very early on. And I also heard that Mr. Wang Guowei received a lot of help from Mr. Wu when he wrote "History of Song and Yuan Drama." But Mr. Wu was someone who scolded the Qing Dynasty, and his creations were once filled with nationalistic anger, which was an absolute ideological difference from Mr. Wang, who always wore a queue. This was also why I hoped he would come to Guangdong. However, the "academic atmosphere" in Guangdong at that time was a bit special, because it was during the "Northern Expedition." Although it was the Faculty of Arts of Sun Yat-sen University, most students were not very enthusiastic about literature, so they did not consider "History of Chinese Opera" an important subject. This situation was probably the reason why my plan did not succeed.

Later, Mr. Wu did eventually go to Sun Yat-sen University (but I must state that this had nothing to do with my failed plan), but I had already left Guangdong. If the words "missed opportunity" can describe all the facts of wanting to meet but not being able to, then Mr. Wu and I can truly be said to have missed our opportunity.

Five years ago in Shanghai, there was another matter that could be considered a one-sided connection with Mr. Wu.

Mr. Wu had once sold a work to Shenzhou Guoguang Publishing House. After the bookstore was reorganized, it was unable to publish it and planned to sell it to a certain large bookstore. At that time, the owner of Shenzhou Guoguang Publishing House asked me to discuss it with the person in charge of that large bookstore. Then, a letter from Mr. Wu to the publishing house was sent to me, and this was the first time I saw Mr. Wu's handwriting. However, this time, like the last time, what I did still had no follow-up.

I never saw the original manuscript of that work, and I can't remember the title now. All I can remember is that it was a large work. I think Mr. Wu's friends must know what happened to that book.

I believe that Mr. Wu's most praiseworthy trait is his nationalistic thought. His early creations like "Legend of Fengdong Mountain," etc., can be called the highest works of old literature, which goes without saying. But what is most commendable is that he was able to maintain his integrity in his later years. Let's not mention the historical figures in Nanjing with the "trousers-crotch" incident, but just take a few contemporary literati. There were many old literati who could not maintain their integrity in their later years, and even some new literati who had the reputation of scholars, for the sake of a stable life, shamelessly lived under the rule of the invaders. Mr. Wu, however, was willing to abandon his family and leave home at the age of over fifty, enduring the hardships of travel without complaint. This point should make some of the unpromising literati of today ashamed. Many memorial articles do not seem to have specifically mentioned this point, and I think this is a major omission.

In the end, I still haven't met Mr. Wu in person. Writing like this seems to be committing some kind of suspicion. But it doesn't matter. For a person like Mr. Wu, who is enough to shame unpromising literati, it can't be considered too much for a stranger to write a few lines for him.

### Breaking Through the Encirclement

— Li Qiao

——Reminiscences of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou

I found a guide, and we walked for more than two hours in the desolate, deserted wheat fields scorched by the hot sun, and arrived at Tucun, where the military headquarters was stationed.

I was thinking that as long as I found the military headquarters, I could get something to satisfy my unbearable hunger and thirst. I didn't expect to get anything to eat, just a few mouthfuls of cold water, and that was it.

Extreme hunger and thirst had probably exhausted the starch stored in my liver. I was as thin as if I had been seriously ill, my face was covered with a thick layer of yellow dust, and the dust had soaked into the blisters on my feet, making them so painful that I couldn't lift them. Exhausted, I lay down under a tree.

The enemy's artillery fire on the mountain ahead was sounding from time to time, as if to warn us. Endless streams of people and horses crossed the Puyi Road, detouring from the fields, still advancing mightily. Suddenly, four or five tanks rushed out from behind the mountain.

Instantly, the people and horses were startled, but quickly calmed down:

"Attack them!"

The people and horses surrounded the five tanks. Somehow, in the earth-shattering shouts, the five tanks retreated in a panic.

The team stopped in a small village opposite Tucun. Two planes flew from behind, constantly searching in the sky. The people and horses, unable to hide, sat in groups under the trees, waiting for them to bomb them. But the two planes, which seemed to have severe myopia, circled low in the sky for more than an hour, and then flew away.

"Damn it, they came but didn't bomb us. They're probably trying to make friends with us!"

"Who wants to make friends with them? Unless—"

"Although we don't want to, they want to make friends with us—!"

"This isn't trying to make friends? They were blind today. Yesterday in Xusancun, they burned down the houses in Xusancun and slaughtered us..."

The team, already trapped in the enemy's encirclement, was constantly drinking cold water, seemingly to increase their motivation. Around three o'clock, under the scorching heat of the setting sun, they followed a dirt road lying in the wheat field and broke through the blockade.

—Boom!

—Boom! Boom!

The enemy's heavy artillery was firing like a farewell, but the team calmly walked through the fields, seemingly ignoring it.

—Boom!

A shell landed in a wheat field not far from the rear of the team, raising a cloud of yellow dust. Then, another shell came and raised another cloud of yellow dust...

The evening breeze brought an incomparable coolness, and the cloud of yellow dust quickly disappeared. The team quickly passed through the wheat field and hid behind a row of green trees behind the village.

### Editor's Notes

— Editor

Regarding the "Door of Struggle" published in this journal on May 8th, a reader wrote to say that it was "purely plagiarized" from Turgenev's "Threshold," and therefore severely criticized the editor. It has now been verified that although "Door of Struggle" has similarities with "Threshold," it cannot be said to be "purely plagiarized." Therefore, we are grateful for the reader's enthusiasm, but we cannot agree with their opinion. As for the rude language, the recipient suffered no loss, and we hope that the speaker will maintain their own dignity.

### Translator's Preface to "Impressions of New China"

— Mei Aizhefei, Bu Ximan Hong

The four of us translated this book in just three weeks, and we feel compelled to say something:

Since Edgar Snow's "Red Star Over China" was translated into Chinese, books about China written by Western authors have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, becoming bestsellers with a large readership in the publishing market.

That China is being taken seriously is, of course, a matter of glory for us. However, what we expect is more than this: First, we expect Europeans and Americans to take China seriously not in a flurry of enthusiasm, but to truly understand China's past and future in this major historical turning point; second, we expect Chinese readers of these "popular books" not to be led by the nose and self-righteous, but to humbly experience and recognize the reality of their motherland.

It is inappropriate to write Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai and others as figures in legends, leading them to develop a way of acting that is not based on materialist dialectics. In order to organize the national united front, they put all the old grudges and new hatreds behind them. Anna Louise Strong tells us a historically significant story in her book "China Fights for Freedom": "When Zhou Enlai advocated the release of Chiang Kai-shek in Xi'an, Chiang Kai-shek's wanted posters offering 80,000 yuan for Zhou Enlai's head were still hanging in Xi'an." Therefore, treating them as legendary figures would ignore the character they cultivated in reality.

EA McRae is a journalist who seems to be visiting China for the first time. During the European War, he fought bravely on the battlefield, working as a news reporter. Later, he experienced and developed his outstanding journalistic talent in the world of politics, so his words are measured, every sentence has insight, he is not excessive, he does not exaggerate, he provides true facts, he does not infuse emotional factors, he uses a vivid pen to write vivid events, and he judges from facts based on his unique insight and rich experience. Therefore, this "Impressions of New China" is one of the most reasonable and ideal journalistic works of pure fire. Foreigners' criticisms of China often distort facts because of traditional relations, or they only look at the surface and specialize in flattery, neither of which are the best works. McRae recognizes the facts, has no preconceived notions, and judges everything based on facts. Therefore, he confirms: "The cause of China's national revival can be carried out under any circumstances. Japan's invasion has strangely accelerated this cause." Japan wanted to destroy China, but McRae believed that it accelerated the progress of China's national revival. Isn't this "strange"? He is also full of a sense of justice, and often expresses dissatisfaction and ridicule with the attitudes of foreigners in Hong Kong and foreign diplomats in Hankou. So his conclusion is: "There is no better way than to generously help innocent China." First, he determined that China was "innocent"; second, he appealed on behalf of China, asking for "generous" help.

He does not shy away from China's trivial weaknesses, but he recognizes Japan's "clay feet." Japanese soldiers came to China to fight, drinking the illusion of "quick victory" from the ruling class. Can Japan's "clay feet" still stand? He believes that the Chinese are the best soldiers in the world, not discouraged and not depressed. He is not boasting for us. In the beginning of the chapter "To and From the Northern Battlefield," he says: "To estimate the chances of winning the War of Resistance, I want to personally see how the Chinese fight." He made a judgment after seeing it. He believes that Japan has indeed "occupied" a large part of China, but this only refers to the map. He said that China's manpower, material resources, and endurance are unlimited, and the nation's unity and unwavering loyalty to the supreme leader means that final victory will not belong to China? His insights and judgments give us a lot of courage and also give us the best opportunity for self-examination.

Also, regarding China's military, political, and economic strength, the author often stands from the perspective of a sympathizer and worries for China, even if it is "杞人之憂," some shallow-minded people may feel "discouraged"; however, the current facts show that China is constantly progressing, striving for continuous progress through hardships.

According to recent reports, the author's father was ordered by the Italian authorities to leave the country within two weeks. Anger? Sympathy? Neither is necessary. Welcome him to the realm of freedom? He disdains it. I have a pen like a knife, and the edge of the pen will be released in the dark. If he can't live in Italy, there are plenty of places to go, see who is the traitor of "world civilization."

As this book is about to be published, we happened to receive the news that Mr. McRae was expelled, and we would like to send him our greatest respect and comfort from afar.

Finally, we thank Mr. Yan Zheng. Without his encouragement and assistance, this book would not have been published. (Auction by Mo Jin)

Science and Life

### Late Bloomers in the Scientific Community

— Ji Qian

Scientists who make great contributions and shine in the history of science must devote their entire lives and overcome various difficulties, errors, and failures, persevering to the end in order to achieve final victory. The challenges faced by those who handle major affairs in the world and those who pursue science are very similar. Here are two major figures in the scientific community whose stories are of great interest, and which young Chinese people engaged in science should know: (1) Lamark of France, a master of zoology, formed his own school in the theory of evolution, foreshadowing Darwin's theory. In his early years, he studied theology without interest. He then served as a soldier in the army and was injured on the battlefield. After being discharged, he studied medicine and botany. It was not until the age of fifty that he began to study zoology. For the next thirty years, he continued to study tirelessly and wrote extensively, making groundbreaking contributions to zoology, becoming a person whose name will be forever immortalized in the history of this field. (2) James of the United States, a master of experimental psychology. In his early years, he studied medicine at the university, and then studied zoology, and then specialized in physiology. He worked as a specialist technician in the museum of Harvard University, and later served as an associate professor of physiology. After the age of thirty, due to his broad interests, he hesitated between medicine, zoology, and physiology, wanting to choose one to pursue for the rest of his life, but struggled to decide. It was not until around the age of forty that he decided to study psychology. For the next thirty years, he pioneered experimental psychology in the United States, and his works became famous all over the world, becoming a leading figure in this field. These two people were engaged in various academic pursuits in their early years, with no clear direction, and were slow to make decisions. Although this is unusual, their various attempts created a broad foundation for them to draw on when specializing in one field later. Therefore, once they had a fixed interest in middle age, their previous experiences helped them to specialize and make rapid progress. Moreover, the fact that they spent decades of energy and time to find their true interests also shows their persevering spirit. As the saying goes, "Persist in doing something without stopping, and pursue it to the death." It is no wonder that they were able to achieve great accomplishments. Chinese people engaged in science should learn from the stories of these two people and quickly dispel the mentality of seeking quick results.

### The Zhou Foot

— Qiao Xia Ke

Since the beginning of civilization, measures have been an indispensable system. According to archaeologists, Chinese writing originated in the Yin Dynasty. Therefore, the eight hundred years of the Zhou Dynasty can be regarded as the youth of Chinese culture. Now I want to talk about how long the Zhou foot was, hence the title "The Zhou Foot." Various scholars can conduct research on the Zhou foot from various aspects. As a physician, I can only start from the medical aspect. However, one point must be considered: with eight hundred years of mandate, the time cannot be considered short. Whether there have been reforms in the measurement system during this period is a question. Therefore, I believe that the time when the cited materials were produced must be noted. Chinese medical books are all based on the Inner Canon, which is said to be from the time of the Yellow Emperor; however, since writing originated in the Yin Dynasty, it is unbelievable that there were any books before the Yin Dynasty. Researchers say that the Inner Canon was produced in the late Zhou Dynasty, and it seems that the foot mentioned in the Inner Canon can represent the foot of that time. However, nowadays, storytellers tell stories of the Three Kingdoms, and of course, they will say that Guan Yu was nine feet tall. However, this "foot" is definitely not the commonly used construction foot or meter; then, whether the foot in the Inner Canon is the foot that was common when the Inner Canon was written is still a question. Therefore, I apologize that although I use the Inner Canon as material, I still dare not determine that the foot in the Inner Canon is the foot of the late Zhou Dynasty. I can only generally call it the Zhou foot, that is, the foot of a certain period in the Yin Dynasty.

The Inner Canon Spiritual Pivot Volume Six has the following regarding the measurements of the intestines and stomach:

"The pharyngeal opening to the stomach is one foot and six inches long... The small intestine is attached to the left of the spine, looping around and stacked, and its entry into the ileum is attached to the upper part of the navel... It is three zhang and three feet long. The ileum loops around the left side of the navel, stacking downwards... It is two zhang and one foot long. The large intestine crosses the spine to receive the ileum... It is two feet and eight inches long..."

Regardless of what it says, let's try adding up all the numbers, which equals fifty-eight feet and four inches. And the pharyngeal opening to the stomach is the esophagus, which is one foot and six inches long: the small intestine to the large intestine is the intestinal tract, which is fifty-six feet and eight inches long. From this, we can see that the ratio of the esophagus to the intestinal tract is one foot and six inches to fifty-six feet and eight inches, which is equal to one to thirty-six. What is the result obtained from scientific anatomy? The same ratio is one to thirty-seven! The ancients did indeed work practically and did not fabricate out of thin air. Even if the body sizes of ancient and modern people are different, this ratio will not differ by much. Therefore, we can easily calculate the Zhou foot. The length of the esophagus is 0.25 meters in metric measurement, then one foot and six inches in the Zhou Dynasty is equal to 0.25 meters, and one foot is equal to 0.156 meters, which is equivalent to 4.5 old inches. In this way, we know that a "five-foot child" is just a child of two feet and two and a half inches, and a "six-foot orphan" is a small treasure of two feet and seven inches long. Otherwise, the children and orphans of ancient times would have been terribly tall. Therefore, I am reminded of Cao Jiao, the big glutton in Mencius who was "nine feet and two inches tall, and only ate millet." If he appeared among the masses today, he would not only not be considered tall, but would simply be a midget.

People often have the preconceived notion that the present is not as good as the past. Friends who talk about the ways of the world and people's hearts often think that the human body is also getting shorter and shorter; however, the results of research cannot prove this. If the Zhou foot calculated above is indeed consistent with the facts (I remember that someone also calculated it, but not based on anatomy, and the result obtained was slightly larger than the result obtained here), and there is no blood of other races mixed in the blood of Yan and Huang, then it is clear that the body length of the ancients is not as good as that of today.

### The Origin of Mankind

— He Shan

The emergence of animals in the world seems to be slightly later than that of plants. According to geologists, the earliest animals appeared as far back as 800 million years ago. However, this should not be considered definitive, as the records preserved in geology are often incomplete. The earliest animals lived in water or damp places, their entire body consisting of a single cell. The protoplasm in their bodies could contract and expand freely, and their form was indefinite, much like the amoebas that live in water today. Biologists consider amoebas to be the most ancient animals, and the fact that their species has not become extinct after hundreds of millions of years is evidence of this. These animals can only absorb organic matter and cannot absorb inorganic matter. They require bacteria and various tiny plants in the water as food. They do not have the ability to produce their own food. There are also extremely lower animals, very similar to plants, that can survive on air, water, and minerals. Their bodies produce chlorophyll, or substances similar to chlorophyll, which utilize sunlight to decompose carbonic acid and perform photosynthesis to create carbon compounds for their own nutrition. The green flagellates that live in water, for example, are considered by botanists to be protophytes. From one perspective, these organisms appear to be plants, but from another perspective, they also have the characteristics of animals, so zoologists also consider them to be animals.

The above refers to the most primitive animals. Ascending from these to the highest animals, we find mankind. The differences between them are very obvious. However, from the lowest to the highest animals, from simple to complex, from a single cell to the human body composed of tens of millions of uncountable cells, there is a definite order of evolution that can be sought. In protozoa, many cells aggregate into clusters, and the functions of each cell gradually become different from each other, such as Volvox. Further along, there are loose tissues formed by cells, which are sponge animals. From these, various invertebrates emerge, and then vertebrates. The highest of these is mankind, all of which have evolved from the lowest animals. Cells in the human body resemble protozoa. For example, leukocytes and female reproductive cells (i.e., egg cells) are similar to amoebas; muscle cells and male reproductive cells (i.e., sperm) are similar to flagellates; and epidermal cells of the larynx and epidermal cells of the intestines are similar to ciliates. This is because the human body evolved from primitive organisms, and this is the existence of their vestiges.

### New Advances in Canned Food

— Rong Ren

Food stored in tin cans can be preserved for a long time and can be carried to any location, making it extremely convenient. However, some people still find it inconvenient that it needs to be heated in a pot of water, especially for travelers, picnickers, explorers in the desert, and defenders in trenches. Therefore, someone in the United States researched this problem and recently invented a food can that is equipped with fuel inside and can automatically heat the stored food.

The four sides of this can are made of layered tin sheets, with a chemical substance as fuel in the middle layer. All other parts are the same as ordinary food cans. When eating, first punch four holes around the lid, penetrating into the middle layer. Air immediately rushes in from the holes and causes a chemical reaction with the chemical substance pre-placed inside, generating strong heat. After a few minutes, the food inside the can has been heated to the appropriate temperature, just like being heated in a pot.

According to the inventor, this chemical substance does not explode and is not dangerous, and the additional equipment does not cost much, only one U.S. cent per can. It is expected that this self-heating food can will become widely popular in the future, and the convenience of food cans will be further enhanced.

### Chemical Decomposition of Ice

— Xin Shan

Large ships sailing in the ocean are often greatly threatened by icebergs crossing the shipping lanes. In cold weather, factory machinery, bridges over rivers, and ships sailing along the coast or inland rivers are also subject to many obstructions and losses due to freezing. However, scientists have appropriate methods to deal with these issues.

Ice can be lost by strong winds, heated into water, and decomposed by chemicals. But after scientists' research, the most economical and effective method is to use thermite to break ice and thaw. Thermite is a mixture of aluminum powder and iron oxide. It undergoes a violent chemical reaction when burned, creating liquid steel with a very high temperature. It is commonly used for welding metals and streetcar tracks. If this extremely hot liquid steel is suddenly placed on ice, it will melt a hole several feet deep; at the same time, the ice water decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen gases, causing a very strong explosion that shatters the ice itself. Not only that, the water flow at this time also flows along the original path, constantly carrying away the ice that is subjected to the hot radiation and explosion. In this way, we can thaw extremely large ice surfaces in rivers; the terrifying icebergs in the ocean are broken into small pieces, no longer obstructing the passage of ships.

Salt, calcium chloride, calcium carbide, crude sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid can all be used to decompose hard ice. Slag and gravel, when mixed with a small amount of calcium chloride and scattered on the ice, can also help sunlight to quickly melt the surface of the ice.

### Reducing Humidity for Cooling

According to general reports, discomfort in the summer is not due to heat, but due to high humidity. However, most of the currently used air conditioning methods (commonly known as air conditioning equipment) are based on reducing temperature, rather than reducing humidity. However, there is a new type of air conditioning method, called "Caloride," which focuses on reducing humidity. Its principle is to reduce humidity to a comfortable level, but the temperature does not undergo significant changes. This method uses specially made calcium chloride blocks to absorb moisture in the air, and uses ordinary tap water as the only cooling medium, without using any refrigeration machinery.

### Non-Melting Asphalt Roads

If a small amount of chlorinated rubber is added to tar, the binding agent used for road construction, it can prevent the tar in the road from melting easily in the summer and from becoming brittle in the winter. The United Kingdom is currently testing the construction of this type of road.

Measuring Soil Moisture with Electric Current

The amount of water in the soil is extremely important for the harvest of crops. Too much can cause rot, and too little can cause withering, both resulting in poor harvests. However, soil moisture is not easy to measure, so irrigation is often not done properly. Recently, researchers at the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station in the United States invented a new method for measuring soil moisture that is simple, fast, and extremely accurate.

This method is based on a fact: a piece of gypsum buried in the soil changes its humidity in the same way as the soil's humidity, and its electrical conductivity changes with its humidity. Therefore, their method only requires burying a piece of gypsum of suitable standard size in the soil to be tested. Two wires are connected to the gypsum and led to a power source and an ammeter. By observing the amount of current shown by the ammeter, the soil moisture can be known.

It is said that this method can accurately indicate even the low humidity that causes plants to wither.

Fireproofing with Paint

With war approaching, British chemists have recently created a paint that can be applied to wood or wooden buildings to reduce fires caused by incendiary bombs. This paint can localize fires, and it has proven successful in small-scale tests.

Hard Paper Sculptures

Recently, someone invented a method of hardening paper pulp with synthetic resin, creating a material for sculpture called "hard paper." Its hardness is equal to that of boxwood, and its texture is extremely fine. According to the inventor, this new material can rival stone, iron, bronze, and other materials used for sculpture.

### Research on Carrier Pigeons

— Zhuo Cun

April 26th. This publication contains an article entitled "Military Communication Pigeons Discovered in Guizhou," hence this "Research on Carrier Pigeons."

Researching the use of ordinary pigeons for transmitting letters, our country has a long history. It is often seen in the Anecdotes of the Kaiyuan Era: Zhang Jiuling of the Tang Dynasty, when he was young, raised a flock of pigeons. Whenever he corresponded with relatives and friends, he tied the letters to the pigeons' feet and sent them to the instructed places, calling them "flying servants." Also, the Zhengzi Tong states: Zheng Fuli of the Tang Dynasty said that Persian ships often raised pigeons, and the pigeons could fly thousands of miles. When one was released to the home, it was used as a message of safety. According to this, the practice of carrier pigeons transmitting letters existed as early as the early Tang Dynasty. It has been practiced both domestically and abroad for a long time and did not just begin today.

In the Zhejiang Province "Public Education Youth Center" two years ago, there was a "Carrier Pigeon Research Association" that often held long-distance carrier pigeon races. I remember one race from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, a distance of 164 li, and the fastest pigeon took only 90 minutes, which was a very good result and broke the previous record. There were plans to conduct test flights in Pingwang and a large race in Suzhou. The progress in racing will be limitless.

However, the use of pigeons to transmit military documents as military pigeons was first seen in modern times. In the "European War," it had a remarkable effect—because pigeons have strong memories, and with specialized training and long-distance flight practice, they can reach any distance and are suitable for any situation! The pigeon, as a creature, seems to have vast magical powers and infinite uses!

(Editor's note) The world's military communication pigeons are mainly of French, Belgian, and German breeds.

### Rewarding Merit with a Gold Medal

A ship merchant from Peru hired Chinese workers to work abroad. While passing through Japan, an incident occurred, and they were detained. Chen Sima, a commissioner of the Shanghai Concession Court, was ordered by the governor-general to go to Japan to investigate. All the stranded refugees were brought back. (Note: Please refer to Old Newspaper Excerpts No. 24 on May 10th.) When Commissioner Chen set off from Shanghai, Mr. McGarthy, a former American translator in Shanghai, accompanied him on the same boat to assist in the matter. All the foreign language documents were translated into Chinese by Mr. McGarthy. When the task was completed, Commissioner Chen detailed Mr. McGarthy's assistance and requested Governor Shen to seek awards and rewards for merit. He also reported on the rescue of drowning refugees, the inquiry into abusive situations, and the reporting to the British Consul General of the British shipowner Erin, who was investigated by the Japanese labor officials. He requested rewards for all of them. A document of commendation has now been received from the governor-general, and each has been rewarded with a gold medal for merit, which will be forwarded by the Circuit Intendant.

### Peruvian Envoy Arrives in Japan

The people of Peru, due to the release of "piglets" (Chinese laborers), brought an iron warship to the Orient to discuss the matter. On the 10th, they suddenly saw a large ship in the distance, with the Peruvian flag flying high, rushing towards them, and they were greatly terrified! They were at a loss. When the ship approached, they saw that it was not an iron ship, but the Wan Chang steamship, carrying the Peruvian envoy to the Orient to establish friendly relations. They specifically raised the Peruvian flag to show respect. When the Peruvian envoy came, they originally traveled on several warships, but they heard rumors that Peru's actions were intended to seek revenge on the Orient, so they placed the warships in Hong Kong to dispel Japanese suspicion.

### Gu Jing Refined Study

The Shanghai academies, apart from Longmen, mainly focused on formal essays, occasionally touching on poetry and prose, but none engaged in scholarly discussions of the classics and history. Moreover, Shanghai has a large population, and Longmen is crowded, making it difficult for many to find places. Therefore, Commissioner Shen is building the Gu Jing Refined Study and distributing generous salaries to the students from his own salary. His assessment of students does not emphasize poetry and prose, but focuses on the classics and history.

To be published tomorrow: Business in North Shanghai; Fire at the Grand Hall of Yuhang County.

### The Life of Rickshaw Pullers

— (Yan)

The lives of rickshaw pullers are among the most painful of the lower classes in Shanghai. After the Shanghai War, their lives, along with the changes in the entire Shanghai living environment, also underwent great changes. Here, I will describe these changes in a rambling manner:

During the Shanghai War

During the fierce fighting of the Shanghai War, some people said: "Rickshaw pullers have made a fortune!" In fact, only a very few rickshaw pullers earned some meager gains. The vast majority of rickshaw pullers were driven out of the vast slums of Zhabei, Hongkou, and the South Station by the ruthless artillery fire and bombs; all that remained were hunger, disease, and death! During the lead-up to the Shanghai War and the initial period of the withdrawal of the Chinese army, due to the depletion and confusion of the city's economy and the surge in unemployed people, there were more rickshaw pullers than passengers, and their lives fell into a tragic fate!

Life After the War

Afterward, although the market gradually stabilized, their lives also stabilized somewhat, but they were ten times more painful than before the war. This problem was not only caused by the "too many rickshaw pullers and sluggish business," but more seriously by the aspect of housing. Before the war, they lived in the vast slum areas of Hongkou, Zhabei, and Nanshi, where they only needed to pay one or two yuan a month for rent, and some of them even lived in thatched sheds, without needing to pay any rent. But now it is different. Now they live in the slum areas of Shanghai, whether on roads built beyond the concession or in the concession area, they need to pay five or six yuan a month for rent. How can they afford this? As a result, food and daily necessities have skyrocketed, and everything is expensive, leaving them breathless with oppression!

Increased Black Market Prices

However, the above constraints are not the main reasons for their increasingly painful lives. What strikes them the most is the increased black market price of rickshaw rentals. Before the war, the rental price of each rickshaw was originally sixty cents a day. Since the Chinese army withdrew from Shanghai, there were so many people making a living by pulling rickshaws that rickshaw merchants thought they had a rare commodity and secretly raised the rental price by ten cents. Then, from seventy cents, they secretly raised the black market price to eighty cents, and then ninety cents. Although the authorities of the two concessions registered and restricted rickshaw pullers, eliminating some of the old and weak, the rickshaw pullers still suffered from a surplus. Therefore, rickshaw merchants would never reduce this illegally exploited black market price by even a penny. In this way, rickshaw pullers not only find it difficult to earn the daily cost of their sweat and blood, but also often lose money for several days!

Price Increase Issue

However, although the rickshaw pullers are in such pain, the rickshaw merchants not only do not consider their suffering, but instead intensify their exploitative methods. Before February, they used the excuse of "cost relations" to announce a price increase of twenty cents per rickshaw! Thus, if the price increase is realized, their daily rental price, including the black market price, would be one yuan and ten cents! They certainly strongly oppose this. If the rickshaw merchants insist, they will all refuse to pull rickshaws. So the situation at the time was very tense. Fortunately, through the mediation of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, the rickshaw merchants agreed to postpone the price increase. Now, the issue has been shelved indefinitely.

Reading Mutual Aid

In the face of the phenomenon of rickshaw pullers' lives falling into an increasingly dire situation, the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association also has a good phenomenon of practical improvement in their lives: In order to promote their literacy and spirit of mutual aid, after "August 13th," they established a "Rickshaw Pullers Spare Time School," providing free lessons for two hours every day—from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The location is inside the Mutual Aid Association. However, due to limited finances, the scope is extremely small, and there are only about fifty rickshaw pullers studying at the school on time. Here, we sincerely hope that the Mutual Aid Association will take the necessary steps to expand this beneficial and obligatory service to the rickshaw pullers, so that every rickshaw puller struggling in poverty and hunger will have the opportunity to become literate and seek knowledge!

### The Despised Dregs

— Xiao Ying

The Small Clerk in the Organization

Organizations are magnificent places. Mentioning organizations may inspire admiration in many people, and naturally, the staff inside will inevitably arouse so-called "envy."

However, organizations, just like companies, are divided into many levels. Apart from tea servers and messengers, the most basic employee is the clerk. This stage is called "employee"; employees are not ranked and do not need any "appointment letter" or "employment contract." A notice is enough to take office, and the procedures are very simple. Unlike other appointed officials or other officials who have letters to hold and qualifications to take, they are "officials," and the stages of officials and "employees" cannot be mentioned in the same breath.

However, even though the role is basic, being able to enter the doors of an organization is not an easy task. Most are introduced by staff inside, and sometimes there are recruitment exams, but in a crowded group, the hope of being hired is quite slim.

The only principle for clerks is to write neatly, tidily, and quickly. After entering, colleagues inevitably ask you to "share the labor" of many extra tasks, on the one hand, to relax and ease the burden, and on the other hand, to test your abilities. Thus, submissions, official letters, consultations, instructions, orders, attachments, and things like announcements and miscellaneous items all accumulate on one person. Here, you need to train yourself in the format of each type of official document, how many characters should be indented, what should be enclosed in double parentheses or single parentheses, what punctuation marks should be added, and although you can imitate the original manuscript, you must correct errors in the original manuscript. However, you cannot stop there. You also need to train in writing with a stylus on stencil paper, creating lists, and other tasks.

In this way, every morning upon arriving at the office, you sign in, sit down, and neatly copy the official documents of different natures, and send them out. At least, you will be dealing with five or six thousand characters under your wrist.

Probably fearing the unfairness of how much is copied, a commanding and managing employee was added afterward, who was seemingly the head of the clerks, and if you had to compare it, it would be like a foreman. He implemented the unified collection and distribution of the documents prepared for copying that were collected each day. He roughly calculated how many people were in the room, the total number of characters collected, and how much each person should distribute. However, the calculation of the distribution was clearly a bit different. For submissions, it was necessary to be neat and uniform, dignified and meticulous, and writing one character counted as five. Official letters and consultations were slightly more relaxed in their untidiness, with one character counting as three. As for instructions and orders, one counted as one, and two counted as a pair, with absolutely no discounts.

Writing and writing, from the office to your own home, and then from home to the office, letting the days pass by without distinguishing the years, gradually, the waist and back also become curved. If you are "sensible," you may receive fewer instructions. Otherwise, even if you touch the tiger's might of the superiors, you may have your rice bowl broken in a fit of anger. If there are any changes in the heads of the organization, you are even more filled with anxiety. The stage of "officials" inevitably involves cuts, and sometimes, if they feel like it and pay attention, even "employees" will be implicated.

What about promotions? If you do not have extraordinary connections, you should not even think about such an idea!

Clerks, this basic role, what is there to envy? In the organization, they are merely the despised dregs!

### Two Fronts

— Fo

The so-called two fronts are one aggressive front and one anti-aggressive front.

The aggressive front has long been organized and has now signed a "death vow," saying "we do not wish to be born on the same day of the same month of the same year, but we wish to die on the same day of the same month of the same year," and is waiting to openly and boldly seek profit.

And on the anti-aggressive front, Mr. England and Mr. Soviet have been talking for a long time, but it is still "three days and three nights of talking about where to go." This hesitant and timid attitude is giving aggressors an excellent opportunity.

Pay attention! Mr. "But"!

### After the Rain Comes Sunshine

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 10: The Virtuous Mother with a Chignon and Green Skirt; The Spirited Old Man with Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves

This Miss He Liyu is more lively and mischievous than Bian Yu. She heard that the village chief Zhu seemed to admire Lao Zi Shi and greatly praised the village chief's wife, Xie Ayu. Therefore, she said with a smile, "I think your father-in-law is much younger than Elder Xu. Elder Xu is over seventy years old and married a new wife, so why can't your father-in-law, who is only over sixty years old now, take a new wife? If your father-in-law were to marry a new wife, I think not only would he have a son like Elder Xu, but he might even have several sons. It's your wife who's not good; she should be a matchmaker for her father-in-law. Is she afraid that many younger uncles will be born, and that her grandfather will no longer love her? That's her fault! Although we haven't seen Elder Xu's body and how strong he is, we have seen your father-in-law's spiritedness!" Village chief Zhu also laughed and said, "Forget it! We can't compare to Elder Xu. Elder Xu is a former rich man who was pampered and never suffered. Although he also grew up in the village, he has always lived a carefree life. Unlike us, who have suffered since childhood, and have been peasants from youth to old age. Although you see me as healthy, I am still just good-looking on the surface. The injuries I suffered during the war often ache when the seasons change or when it's cold. Fortunately, I still know how to take care of myself. Since my wife's grandmother passed away, I have not remarried, nor do I want to remarry. My heart is already like dead wood and ashes. For decades, I have never had that kind of thought. Elder Xu can say that he has no children, so what old-fashioned ideas are there to remarry? But I have never had these ideas. If I do have this idea, then I have a granddaughter-in-law who may be better than other people's sons and grandsons who can't establish themselves. Moreover, I only have one arm, a disability, so what young woman would be willing to marry a one-armed old man?" Zhu Aiqun interjected, "That's not necessarily true. I remember Mr. Zhao Letian, he only had one leg, but he still created a romance." He Liyu heard Zhu Aiqun mention Zhao Letian, and the name sounded familiar. She suddenly remembered: In the train from Shanghai to Suzhou, we met a gentleman who had suffered an honorary wound and was sitting with us, who only had one leg, wasn't he called Zhao Letian? He also said: He and village chief Zhu of Liberty Village were old friends and wanted to come to Liberty Village to see him, and asked us to bring a message. How come he also has some romance? We must ask them what the romance is. (118)

Harmonica Hospital

### A Hospital That Isn't a Hospital

— New Dream

Reading the translation of "Fountain Pen Hospital Depiction" in the 19th issue of this publication reminded me of another type of hospital that is not a hospital, but is similar in nature to a fountain pen hospital, which is the harmonica hospital.

Since the harmonica association was discovered in this city of Shanghai, promoting the art of the harmonica, over the past seven or eight years, it has created many harmonica performers; at the same time, the harmonica has also spread to every corner. A harmonica, with more expensive ones costing three to five dollars, and if it is blown and damaged, or the reeds inside are broken, it is excusable to discard it.

However, this problem will not disappoint you. On the other hand, some people saw the popularity of the harmonica and knew that it would definitely be blown and damaged, so many of them learned the technique of repairing harmonicas, borrowed a corner of the storefront, hung up a sign for repairing harmonicas, and started operating a new business.

These places that repair harmonicas mostly only borrow a small corner of the storefront and set up a glass counter. The scale is very small. At the same time, they also sell various harmonicas. If your harmonica's wood is damaged, or the reeds are broken and it doesn't sound, they can fix it for you.

Shops that repair harmonicas usually only have a shop name and hang a sign. But later, someone came up with a whimsical idea and called it a "Harmonica Hospital," indicating that no matter how damaged the harmonica is, they can fix it for you. Although it is the same repair of harmonicas, calling it a "hospital" seems to attract more attention, and it is also a kind of business skill for merchants. Although the substance is unchanged, changing the name is not only pleasant to the ear, but may also attract more customers?

I remember before "August 13th," there were several harmonica repair shops on Wenmiao Road, and one of them had a sign that read "Harmonica Hospital." After "August 13th," these harmonica repair shops all moved into the concessions and scattered everywhere, and were relatively concentrated in the area of Avenue Edward VII and Jing'an Temple Road. Now, if you patrol along Avenue Edward VII, you will surely find a few, and some of them have the words "Harmonica Hospital" hanging out, arranged quite artistically, and even equipped with neon lights—in addition, there are also a few on Henan Road and Avenue Joffre.

### Theater People Remaining in Chongqing Unite to Perform Xia Yan's "A Year"

— Water Foam

Yang Hansheng, Shen Xiling, and Ying Yunwei All Take the Stage; Ying Yin, Shu Xiuwen, and Xiong Hui Also Participate in the Performance

Since leaving Shanghai, the Shanghai Salvation Daily moved to Guangzhou first, and then to Guilin. This newspaper, loved by the people of Shanghai, decided to have all the theater people remaining in Chongqing give a large-scale performance for the Salvation Daily because it had no funds, and all the income would be allocated to its fund. In order to cherish this Salvation Daily, which has a wide audience and a glorious history, this large-scale performance is indeed a sensation throughout Chongqing.

The play being performed is "A Year," recently written by Xia Yan, the editor of the Salvation Daily. This is a powerful work during the War of Resistance. It uses comparative techniques to write about the newly born China. During the War of Resistance, there are still many people who are so ignorant, so unaware, so pessimistic, and so wavering. At the end of the play, the character of the pessimist finally dies, while the living generation, they have faith, are willing to endure hardship, and are willing to sacrifice and grow up.

This play, performed during the War of Resistance, should not be a satire, but a powerful instruction!

The people participating in this performance not only include famous actors, but also famous playwrights and directors.

The director executing "A Year" is Shen Xiling, who is married to Xiong Hui of "Madam Korea" (note) (he has directed films such as "Crossroads" and "Daughter of the Boatman"). The stage supervisor is Ying Yunshu, the former host of the Amateur Experimental Theater Troupe.

The leading actors, first let's show everyone a few directors and playwrights: Song Zhidi (playwright of "Wu Zetian"), Shen Xiling, Yuan Congmei (director Lei Ying), Pan Zinong, Yang Hansheng (who has written many scripts for the Shanghai film industry), and Ying Yunwei.

As for the other actors, almost all of Shanghai's red stars have been gathered here, including: Bai Yang, He Feiguang, Ying Yin, Shi Chao, Wang Weiyi, Chen Tianguo, Shu Xiuwen, Gu Er'yi, Ye Qian, Zhao Dan, Xiong Hui, Wu Yin, Zheng Yongzhi, etc.

The performance location is still the Cathay Theatre, with two shows every day. The ticket price is a minimum of two corners and a maximum of eight corners.

As for the detailed performance situation, I will report it to the continuers as soon as I have news.

### Hollywood Famous Composer Comes to China to Study Dramatic Music

— Kun

Making Chinese Musical Film, Titled "Hong Kong Singing Girl"

Hollywood's famous drama song producer, Mr. J.K. Frimson, the composer of films such as "Rosemarie" and "Blue Kitter," traveled a long way to study Chinese dramatic music and arrived in Hong Kong by clipper plane a few days ago, a journey of more than 10,000 miles. According to Mr. Frimson, American music is too Negroid and needs to change its style. He believes that the best substitute is the Chinese melody.

He also said that although Chinese music is still old tunes, if you use your brain and re-create it, it will be much more pleasant to listen to. Moreover, it must be done this way in order to show "the beauty of Chinese melody."

Mr. Frimson is preparing to make a Chinese musical film, titled "Sing Kong Girl." He has already written part of the script. The plot describes the space starting in Hong Kong and then moving to New York, with the aim of harmonizing Chinese and American music.

He also wants to lead a film crew to China to capture the scenery of Hong Kong. He said, "We can also arrange Chinese scenery in Hollywood, but I don't want to do that, because that would lose the authenticity of the Chinese scenery."

He also wants to find a beautiful Chinese girl in Hong Kong who is proficient in English to play the protagonist in this film.

Mr. Frimson is a lover of Chinese drama. When Dr. Mei Lanfang went to the United States to perform, he did a lot of introduction work. He learned a section of the play "Drunken Concubine" from Mei, and several American newspapers published his costume photos, calling him "Our Yang Guifei."

### The Age of Female Stars

— Evening Yu

However, in fact, the age of Chinese female stars is still an unfathomable mystery forever; in the cinema, in the photography studio, one often hears the question "How old is so-and-so this year?" but no one answers it. Even if there is, it is nothing more than words of ambiguity such as "probably," "maybe," or "perhaps." Naturally, since female stars are unwilling to report their true age, then unless it is the parents who gave birth to them, knowing their exact age is a very difficult thing!

The ages of the following female stars are obtained from various investigations. If there are any errors, it is up to the female stars themselves to correct them:

Wang Renmei 26 years old

Wang Ying 29 years old

Bai Yang 25 years old

Chen Yunshang 21 years old

### Ma Zuiliang, Who Was Rumored to Be Dead, Recently Performed in Chengdu

— Yan Yan

Probably at the end of last year, the news that Ma Zuiliang had died in Shaanxi was rumored in Shanghai and Ping, and it was very confirmed that he died of smoking and lust, how can this not make those who love him feel sorry for him? Although Ma Zuiliang is not very famous in Shanghai, he is a big shot in Shandong.

Cousin of Lianchang

He is the cousin of Ma Kunshan, and Ma Lianliang, Ma Chunqiao, Ma Sili, etc. are all cousins. His teacher was the famous Sun Juxian, and he was also a proud disciple of Lin Wushan. His original name was Ma Shuliang. He performed in the Qiankun Grand Theater of the Great World in this port for a long time in his childhood. Later, he went north to join the Binqing Class hosted by Yu Zhenting. Wang Shaolou, Li Wanchun, etc. were all figures in the heyday of Binqing. At that time, his name was changed.

White Eyebrow Zuiliang

Ma Zuiliang, there is also a reason for this, because when he went north, a celebrity on the sea sent a title of "White Eyebrow Zuiliang," so he changed his name to Zuiliang and his style name to White Eyebrow. In the past ten years, he has traveled all over Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, Henan and the Northeast, and has enjoyed a good reputation. He is determined to "consolidate his position" and completely wins the sympathy of the audience with his true talents and skills, and never calls himself with supporting roles.

Double Package Case

Three years ago, Li Wanchun performed at the Golden Grand Theater, and his name was in the troupe. At first, everyone was not suspicious. Later, the sign kept going down, and the play code kept moving forward, and everyone became suspicious. Later, after investigation, it was found that he was a fake, his original name was Ma Junshuo, and he originally sang the central axis in the Great World. His fake name just wanted to reach the sky in one step, but in the end he was in a dilemma and slipped away. At that time, Zuiliang also published an announcement in various newspapers.

Big Red in Rong

As for the death news spread last year, it has long been confirmed to be inaccurate. According to someone from Chengdu recently, Ma Zuiliang has been performing at the Chengdu Hua Grand Stage since the first day of the first lunar month, and the first play was "Borrowing the East Wind", the second day was "Ten Paths of Books", and the third day was "Burning Hulu Valley". The ticket price was sold for one yuan and two corners, and it was sold out. So far, the business has not declined slightly.

Getting Married

It is also said that Zuiliang has the support of Liu Kuiguan, the Shanghai actor and owner of the stage, and will marry the daughter of a certain gentleman, a local celebrity of the same religion (Islam). Everything is in full swing and has already been in sight. If he can get the consent of his old father, the wedding ceremony will be held in the near future.

### Anecdotes Outside the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Ten Talented Students Trained with 100,000 Public Funds

In the past, there were quite a few opera schools in Peiping. There were many opera schools established by actors, and there were also many established by princes and nobles at the end of the Qing Dynasty. After the Republic of China, only Fu Liancheng and Bin Qing Society remained, which were considered the end of their ropes. After the Northern Expedition, Party-state veterans Li Shizeng and others founded the China Opera and Music Academy in the capital, and a opera school was attached to the academy in Muchang Hutong, outside Chongwenmen, the former capital. The school had ample funding. In addition to the monthly allocation of 1,000 yuan from the Opera and Music Academy (some say there was an additional subsidy of 2,000 yuan from the Ministry of Education), it also received a subsidy of 600-700 yuan per month from the social education funds of the Peiping Municipal Government Education Bureau. It is estimated that since its establishment in 1919, a total of 200,000 yuan of public funds have been spent. At that time, the principal, Jiao Juyin (name Chengzhi), was the nephew of Li veteran, and the school affairs director, Ms. Lin Sushan, was also the principal's wife. This husband and wife school, which sang in harmony, has been maintained as usual until now. As the saying goes, "money is omnipotent," because they have a strong fund and a fixed monthly funding, so although Jiao and Lin are both talents in the drama industry, it can be said that they have no research on the old opera, but the result is still quite successful. This also shows the hard work and the effort to improve the running of the school by the couple. At the beginning of the school's establishment, a hiring committee was organized. All the leaders in the administrative and financial circles of Peiping, as well as the advanced and famous figures in the opera circle, were hired as members of the school. Therefore, Li Shizeng, Zhou Dawen, Zhou Zuomin, Zhang Boju, Wang Shaoxian, Yu Shuyan, Yang Xiaolou, Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Qian Jinfu, Cao Xinquan, Xiao Yunfu, Wang Yaoqing, Cheng Jixian, Pu Xiyuan, Bao Danting, Zhai Rushan, Xu Lingxiang, Chen Moxian, and Jin Zhongsun were all included. The school originally planned to open three departments: music, opera, and drama. Later, because the funds were insufficient, it was decided to run the opera department first. If it can be formally performed in three or four years, not only will the students have the opportunity to practice, but they can also have a slight income. If this money is saved, the music and drama departments can be gradually added. (19)
