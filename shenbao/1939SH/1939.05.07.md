On the 6th, a small number of Japanese troops remained unsuppressed at Qingshuizhai. The Japanese army has been conducting joint land-air attacks on Tajianwan, northeast of Suixian, for five days.

From the 3rd to the 6th, Japanese casualties exceeded one thousand, but the Chinese positions remained steadfast. In the Maping area of ​​Zheshui, Chinese forces continued their fierce offensive on the 6th. The Chinese left detachment launched a surprise attack on the vicinity of Beiyan Mashan in Zheshui at 3:00 AM, engaging in a bloody battle with over a thousand Japanese troops stationed there. The fighting involved repeated assaults, resulting in heavy Japanese casualties, though the Chinese also suffered considerable losses. The fighting north of Zhongxiang was relatively subdued.

Editorial

### The Catastrophe in Chongqing

After the large-scale bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft on May 3rd and 4th, the number of civilian casualties reached a new record since August 13th. It is reported that the most bustling streets of Chongqing were turned into scorched earth, and the total number of Chinese civilians and some foreigners killed and injured reached approximately five thousand. Indiscriminate bombing of various parts of China by Japanese aircraft was already commonplace, and whenever the Japanese army suffered a defeat, they would intensify their aerial atrocities, indiscriminately bombing undefended Chinese cities. However, the bombing of Chongqing, Ningbo, Fuzhou and other places proves that the Japanese army has suffered general defeats on the northern and southern battlefields in the last month. Is this really a strategy? This is venting anger, this is covering up shame!

We express our infinite condolences to the Chinese people who have tragically suffered death and injury, and the separation of families and the loss of property due to the bombing by Japanese aircraft in various places in the past; the large number of sacrifices suffered by the citizens of Chongqing and foreign residents this time makes every rational person in the world feel deeply heartbroken. The international community should not turn a blind eye to this phenomenon, whether for justice or for humanitarian reasons. However, written protests and verbal condemnations cannot force her to correct "planned atrocities". Therefore, in addition to disaster relief such as rescue and relief, we must work hard to participate in it. Fundamentally, we must also seek effective ways to sanction atrocities. Sanctioning atrocities is not a piecemeal matter, we should seek a thorough solution. Every Chinese person of course knows how to fulfill his national responsibility during the war of resistance, and everyone who sympathizes with China, at least for the sake of not being able to sit idly by and watch the atrocities, should use its strength to help China resist the war and jointly strive for the final victory; We firmly believe that the day of China's victory is the day when Japanese atrocities end.

Empty curses of atrocities are ineffective. Perpetrators of atrocities will eventually reap the rewards. Look at various parts of China. On the one hand, they have suffered losses due to air raids, but at the same time, they are strengthening their resistance forces there. This is by no means sophistry. Originally, Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc, not distinguishing between the front and the rear, demonstrating their power to the Chinese people everywhere, which also sparked the flames of resistance everywhere and stimulated every Chinese person's understanding of the enemy's atrocities. It can be said that the effectiveness of a bombing is greater than that of ten battlefield battles, and is greater than that of a thousand national education lectures. At the same time, every ruthless bombing by Japanese aircraft, killing innocent civilians and destroying cultural institutions, will inevitably arouse widespread attention and deep concern from people around the world, which can also promote a great force that can promote the world's disgust for Japan and the world's practical assistance to China. The bombing of Chongqing this time was certainly more tragic than any previous one, but it also stimulated the strength of the Chinese people and those around the world who sympathized with China more than any previous one. Because this is not only an unprecedented amount, but also a qualitative seriousness.

Why is it qualitatively serious? First, from the point that the target of this bombing of Chongqing was entirely in the downtown area, it can be seen that the Japanese army deliberately targeted Chinese civilians. Objectively, this will inevitably strengthen the anti-war consciousness of the general public, but in the subjective view of the Japanese, the massacre is a demonstration. Although Chongqing is the new capital of China during the war of resistance, in fact, all important military and political institutions have long been evacuated to other places. Is there any reason why the Japanese side does not know this? Even if it is said that some institutions still remain in Chongqing, it is worth bombing; but the actual target of the Japanese aircraft's bombing was not in the government agency area, but in the commercial and residential areas of Chongqing. One bombing was not enough, so they continued with a second bombing, resulting in countless civilian casualties, corpses lying everywhere, and the fire not extinguished for three days, with the disaster area reaching more than two kilometers. Is this not intentional slaughter of civilians?

Second, from the fact that this bombing of Chongqing destroyed the embassies and consulates of various countries, it can be seen that the Japanese army also intends to provoke various countries in the world. Originally, the embassies and consulates of various countries in Chongqing were all located on the top of the mountain, with clear flags and clear locations. Japanese aircraft bombing during the day cannot excuse themselves by claiming poor visibility. However, the Japanese aircraft bombed the embassies and consulates in the same way, indicating that it must have been intentional. The country that suffered the most damage was the United Kingdom. Ambassador Kerr was in Chongqing, the consulate was destroyed, and the ambassador's secretary, Taylor, suffered minor injuries. This was by no means an accidental coincidence, but simply a planned provocation by Japan against the United Kingdom, which was closely related to the anti-British movement instigated by the Japanese in the occupied areas. At the same time, it is also related to the fact that the Japanese cabinet did not listen to the military's demands and did not conclude a comprehensive military alliance with Germany and Italy.

The atrocities of the Japanese army will not stop temporarily. The bombing of Chongqing and other cities will inevitably continue to occur as the Japanese army suffers defeats on the battlefield, but China's resistance forces will inevitably strengthen in inverse proportion, and the sympathy and assistance of various countries in the world to China will inevitably deepen in inverse proportion. Only the aggressors themselves can realize the gains and losses in this!

### After the Yushi Attack: The Great Fire Was Extinguished Yesterday Morning, with One-Third of the City's Houses Destroyed; Casualty Statistics Still Unavailable

The British Embassy Was Affected and Has Protested to Japan

(Chongqing) Today at noon, the air raid alarm sounded, and Chinese fighter planes immediately took to the skies, forming a battle array in preparation. However, the attacking Japanese planes did not appear, and the alarm was lifted after an hour. The fires that had erupted in various parts of Chongqing on Thursday due to the Japanese air raid were extinguished early this morning. However, some streets were still blocked due to collapsed walls. Water, electricity, and telephones have been repaired in several places. The number of casualties has not yet been accurately determined because the affected area is quite large, and some areas have not yet been reached by rescue teams. It is believed that many bodies are buried in these piles of rubble. It is generally believed that since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the casualties from Japanese air raids have been highest in Chongqing on May 4th. According to reliable sources, the number of casualties is estimated to be between four and five thousand. A Reuters correspondent, while touring Chongqing last night, found that several places were still burning. Apart from the burned areas, Chongqing was entirely in darkness. The few people seen on the streets were mostly those who had fled during the air raids of May 3rd and 4th and were now returning to the city to check on their homes or retrieve the few essential items they had been unable to take with them before. At the same time, rescue workers continued their service. Many civil servants from government offices have formed teams to assist in sending refugees to other places. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has appointed Minister He to be fully responsible for handling relief matters. The Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek's personal cars are now being used to transport refugees, and the Chairman's guards are also assisting in the relief work. The nine newspapers in this city jointly published a single newspaper this morning, and its editorial stated that this may be one of the most tragic pages in the history of Chinese newspapers, but expressed China's determination to continue the war of resistance under any circumstances. Our response to the enemy's barbaric behavior is to strengthen the unity of our organization, thereby shattering the enemy's attempts to destroy us. (Reuters, 6th)

(Chongqing) The extent of the loss of life and material damage caused by the Japanese aircraft bombing in Chongqing on the 4th of this month has not yet been accurately tallied this morning. The city is desolate, and the homeless wander the streets, searching for the remains of their relatives in the rubble. The scene is so tragic that it brings tears to the eyes of those who see it. On that day, at 6:00, Japanese planes flew over the city of Chongqing in formation, dropping countless incendiary bombs, causing one-third of the entire city to catch fire. The consulates of Germany, Britain, and France were all on the bombing route. The Guangzhou consulate was only affected, so the damage was small. The British and French consulates were both hit by bombs, causing injuries to those seeking refuge there. The Guangzhou consulate building was intact, but there was fire on three sides, so there was also damage. Many parts of Chongqing's largest street have not yet been extinguished since the bombing the day before yesterday. Among the missing foreigners are two Germans. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

(Chongqing) The scene here is extremely tragic after the large-scale Japanese bombing on Thursday. Many foreign doctors fear that an epidemic may occur, posing a great danger to the city's residents. There are still hundreds of bodies buried in the rubble, and it will take several days to clear them all, according to rescue workers. The most worrying thing is that Chongqing has two million rats, which are very active, and there is a possibility of causing a disaster. Also, when the Japanese planes dropped bombs, they also dropped a large number of leaflets, generally saying that Japan was determined to "level Chongqing to the ground," so the general public was even more panicked. Since yesterday, people have been leaving in groups, carrying whatever they could find and carry. At the same time, rumors are rife here, saying that Japanese planes dropped many cigarettes containing poison. After investigation, it was found that a cigarette factory was bombed, and cigarettes were scattered everywhere. Last night, many relatives of the deceased went to the pile of corpses to identify the bodies. At the same time, petty thieves were searching the corpses for gold and silver jewelry, even knocking out the gold teeth in the mouths of the corpses. Later, the military police arrived to suppress the situation, and the theft subsided. However, yesterday's stench was only the stench of burned corpses, but by today, many of the corpses have rotted. At the same time, rescue workers have not been able to completely remove the corpses. The government has now allocated three million yuan to provide relief to the affected people and has requisitioned public and private vehicles to evacuate the population. Also, when Japanese planes appeared in the sky, firefighters, paramedics, and police officers all rallied to carry out rescue and maintain order. This point has aroused the admiration of foreigners. As for the fire caused by the incendiary bombs, it invaded Chongqing's main streets in the evening, so that the area affected by the fire was twice as large as the area destroyed by the bombs. The theaters were also almost affected, but after a heavy rain, the fire was extinguished. However, after this heavy rain, the hardship of those who were homeless and fled to the suburbs greatly increased. (Associated Press, 6th)

(Chongqing) After the continuous bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes in recent days, a large number of residents have been actively evacuating since the night before. Yesterday alone, more than 100,000 people left Yushi to evacuate to nearby towns. All means of transportation, such as cars, transports, buses, sailboats, and rickshaws, were used for evacuation. Several refugee camps have been established near Chongqing. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

(Chongqing) All the convenient facilities in Chongqing are now in chaos, so the current living conditions here are extremely miserable. Food is almost nowhere to be found, all the restaurants are closed, and even if residents prepare meals, it is difficult because rice, water, vegetables, and meat are not easy to obtain. The refugees leaving for other places are walking along the streets in an endless stream. The government's measures to deal with this situation are admirable, arranging transportation to evacuate the thousands of refugees pouring out of the city. Minister Kong has allocated one million yuan to cover relief expenses. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally inspected the relief efforts yesterday afternoon, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek also led a women's relief team to work from early morning to late at night. (Reuters, 6th)

(Chongqing) On the 3rd of this month, Japanese planes suddenly attacked Chongqing, and two large planes were shot down by the Chinese Air Force, which fled in a panic. On the 4th, they attacked again, bombing the embassies and consulates of Britain, France, and Germany. The extent of the damage is briefly described as follows: (1) The British Embassy and Consulate were both bombed, one foreigner was injured, and more than 20 Chinese people died. (2) Two bombs fell on the French Consulate, one did not explode, and one fell in the corridor, and the building was completely destroyed. (3) Fire broke out around the German Consulate, and the fire spread, causing great damage to the building. (4) The American Church on Cangping Street was completely burned down. The Japanese military's disregard for international law is intended to threaten the interests of various countries in China and follow its attempt to dominate East Asia. It is even more obvious that there are no longer any scruples in its mind. However, yesterday the Japanese side falsely claimed that the Chinese side fired anti-aircraft artillery near the embassies and consulates, hoping to confuse the public and shirk responsibility. Chongqing is now the capital of China, and dignitaries from various countries are concentrated here. In order to protect the safety of dignitaries from various countries, there are absolutely no anti-aircraft units near the embassies and consulates. This has long been known to people from various countries. The Japanese military's false propaganda is enough to show its brutal behavior and attempt to cover up its mistakes. (6th)

(Chongqing) The number of casualties and property losses from the air raid on Thursday were heavy, and the fire that broke out continues to burn. It is now estimated that the casualties are 5,000. British Embassy and Consulate personnel have now withdrawn from the Chongqing site and gone to a certain place on the opposite bank of the river. A German woman, Mrs. Herbach, was found dead near the Guangzhou consulate yesterday, apparently killed by a bomb while trying to take refuge in the German consulate. The German consulate itself was spared from being affected by the surrounding flames and was undamaged. An incendiary bomb was dropped in the courtyard of the French consulate, but there were no casualties, and the building was undamaged. (Reuters, 6th)

(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, regarding the damage to the British Consulate General in Chongqing during the air raid on Thursday, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie made a verbal protest to the Japanese government yesterday. It is reported that Mr. Craigie pointed out the seriousness of the Japanese move and said that the so-called anti-aircraft guns near the consulate were "completely unacceptable." The British Ambassador also requested the Japanese government to take appropriate action to remedy this incident. (Reuters, 6th)

(Tokyo) A Navy Ministry spokesman said today that the Japanese Air Force will continue to attack Chongqing, the seat of the Kuomintang government, and other military locations, without the slightest slackening, until the anti-Japanese Kuomintang government is defeated. (Reuters, 6th)

(Chongqing) The Air Defense Headquarters here received a report at about 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, saying that several Japanese planes were attempting to invade Yushi from the west. After issuing an air raid alarm at noon, the Japanese planes, seeing that the Chinese side was prepared, turned and flew elsewhere, so the alarm was lifted. (6th)

### The Military Commission Announces Weekly Battle Situation

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Commission said that during the week (April 28 to May 4), the enemy forces on the northern and southern fronts were continuously and fiercely attacked by our attacking troops, resulting in many victories and the recapture of many places, causing the enemy to flee in embarrassment. The important results are as follows:

Guangdong Front: Around Guangzhou, Sanshui and Xinjie have been successively recovered, Zengcheng has been captured twice, and important strongholds such as Fuhe and Shikang have been successively captured. In the Paitan area, more than 800 officers and soldiers, including the enemy's Regimental Commander Takeshita Kitaro, have been killed. Now the outer perimeter is completely controlled by us, and the encirclement is getting smaller and smaller. This week, a part of our surprise troops once entered the city, killing more than 500 enemies. The enemy's families have been evacuated. The 3,000 to 4,000 enemies in Xijiang, Xinhui, and Jiangmen have been attacking Heshan, Daze, and Zhuliuhe in the west for days, and the momentum is extremely fierce. Our army bravely resisted and fought fiercely for three days and nights. Although each of these places was once lost, they were completely recovered by the 30th morning. In the battles of Zhuliuhe and Daze, more than 1,300 enemies were killed. In the battle for Heshan, more than 1,000 enemies were also killed, including 15 officers at the school-level. All their hundreds of barrels of gasoline were captured. Now our army has forced Xinhui and Jiangmen. In the three areas of northwest Jiangxi Province, our army has an absolute advantage. In addition to their exhaustion, the enemy may make a desperate struggle.

Jiangxi Front: Our army, active in Jiangxi Province, captured Gao'an last week, besieged Wuning, and forced its way to Nanchang. Since this week, although the enemy has done its best to counterattack us, our army has continued to advance with the momentum of sweeping away the fallen leaves, completely breaking the enemy's struggling attempt. Now the enemy has been almost completely eliminated from the four suburbs of Wuning and the four suburbs of Gao'an. On the afternoon of the 29th, our army once rushed into the city. The strongholds of Xiangfuguan, Dachengzhen, and Gaoyoushi northeast of Gao'an have all been captured. We are now besieging Fengxin on three sides and bombarding it fiercely. On the 27th, a large fire broke out in the city, and the enemy's barracks, munitions, and ammunition were all reduced to ashes. On the Fushui River on the front of Nanchang, Hengxi, Liantang, Xiangtang Shengmi Street, Xiefu City, and Wenshui Street, all the important places have been recovered by us one after another, and we have joined forces with the elite troops of Dacheng and Gaoyou to attack fiercely. The enemy resisted stubbornly, and we were defeated step by step. Now our vanguard has forced its way to the city gates and is sweeping away the remnants of the enemy. In recent days, in the Wuning, Gao'an, and Nanchang areas, the number of enemies killed is no less than 2,000. The enemy is doing its best to conscript reinforcements.

Hubei Front: About 2,000 enemies in the Maping, Xihe, Haojiadian, and Xujiadian areas in northern Hubei launched a rapid offensive against the Senlin Temple, Dushan Town, Sanliza, and Quankou Town from the morning of the 30th. Under the encirclement and attack of our large army, more than 1,000 were killed or wounded, and the offensive was frustrated. On the east bank of the Hanshui River, near Luohan Temple, the enemy bombarded Shayang with artillery all day on the 2nd, and launched a large number of poisonous gas bombs. By dawn on the 3rd, our army crossed the river in two routes to launch an attack. At that time, the enemy on the east bank could not resist and immediately collapsed. Without a fight, the important strongholds of Luohan Temple, Duobao Bay, and Sigang City were all recovered. Now we are pursuing the defeated enemies in three routes towards Tuochuanbu, Yonglong River, and Yangjia. The enemy in Tianmen is extremely shaken. Our army attacking Macheng in eastern Hubei captured the county seat on the 30th. On the afternoon of the 1st, we took advantage of the victory to successively capture Zhongguan Zhou and marched towards Songbu. On the same day, we attacked and wounded the enemy's aircraft at Takou, annihilating more than ten enemy soldiers. At that time, all fifteen aircraft in the field were burned down. Our army in southern Hubei is now besieging Tongcheng and Chaoyang. Our army is also divided into two routes, one approaching Zhangzhai and the other pointing directly at Xianning.

Shanxi Front: Our army in Shanxi Province gave separate blows to the enemies who were moving around this week. In southern Shanxi, from the morning of the 2nd, there were fierce battles in Quwo, Shouyang, Zhangdian Town, Wenxi, Anyi, Fushan, and Yicheng. More than 1,000 enemies were killed, and the traffic in each place was completely destroyed, making it impossible for the enemy to communicate. The enemies who invaded the Baijin Highway in Pingyao and Taigu in eastern Shanxi were defeated on all routes on the 28th after a bloody encounter for more than ten days, abandoning more than 3,000 corpses. In the Lishi area of western Shanxi, the enemy army was encircled and severely attacked by us with the force of a swift storm, annihilating five or six hundred people. The remnants of the enemy entrenched in Jingle and Shenchi in northern Shanxi are still under our siege and can be easily annihilated. In total, since this week, our army has killed about 8,000 enemies on all routes. The enemy division commander Taniguchi was seriously injured in the battle of Fushan and is rumored to have been killed. The unit commander Mi in the battle of Anze was also killed at the same time. The enemy was extremely frustrated by this heavy blow and could not do anything about the Datong-Puzhou Railway. In addition, Bo'ai in northern Henan Province, an important stronghold, was also captured. In southern Henan, the enemy who broke through from Xinyang to the northwest was defeated. Wen Deng County in Shandong Province was recovered, and Yixing in northern Jiangsu Province, which had fallen into enemy hands for more than ten months, was reunited with the national emblem on the 3rd and returned to our control. The encirclement of Honglanbu and the control of Nanjing on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway are also our great victories. In Suiyuan, the PingSui Railway and the provincial automobile road were destroyed, making it impossible for the enemy to resume transport and communication between Datong, Baotou, and Bailingmiao. The entire Northwest battlefield is under our control. These are all important achievements within this week, and they have had a great victory in hitting the enemy's conspiracy and promoting the might of our army. (6th)

### Exhibition of Chinese Dynastic Court Costumes in Greater London

Ticket Revenue to Be Used for Relief Funds

(London) The "Exhibition of Chinese Dynastic Imperial and Ministerial Court Costumes" organized by the China Society here intends to donate the ticket revenue to the relief efforts for refugee children led by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wife of Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It officially opened on Wood Day, with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi opening the ceremony. First, the President of the China Society, Sir Malcolm, delivered a welcome speech to Ambassador Guo, followed by Ambassador Guo giving a speech, expressing his gratitude to the China Society and those who enthusiastically supported it, and saying, "The works of art displayed here are all related to our country's culture. British audiences can use it to gain insight into the artistic instincts of our nation, and the sympathy of the British people for China is also expressed through the visit." Those who are collecting here are embroidery and other works of art from the 10th to the 19th centuries, and the collectors of various countries have generously agreed to lend them for display, which is especially admirable. Then, the Director of the British Albert Museum, Ashelton, continued to speak, saying, "Chinese silk embroidery is world-renowned. As early as hundreds of years ago, there were various exquisite products from China. The Danzig Free City Museum currently also has hundreds of years of Chinese embroidery, which can serve as proof. This kind of art has been passed down to this day and is still extremely developed, which is indeed rare and valuable." According to this decision, among the court costumes displayed, the most valuable is the military uniform of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty and the ceremonial robes worn by the emperors during sacrifices. In addition, there is also a piece of jade, uniform in color, 61 cm long and weighing 11.82 kg, which is truly a beautiful material that cannot be seen often. And various exhibits are attached with detailed instructions, so that the audience can understand at a glance, and can also grasp the outline of Chinese culture and philosophy here. (Havas, 5th)

### Securing the Eastern Mediterranean: Anglo-Turkish Agreement Concluded; Proposal for a Three-Power Military Alliance; British Reluctance to Agree with the Soviet Union

Havas, Paris: Although Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov has been removed from his post, the country's foreign policy will not change as a result. Britain and the Soviet Union will continue negotiations based on Britain's latest proposal. Soviet sources here say that Japan, fearing that Britain might accept certain constraints from the Soviet Union in the Far East, is eager to prevent this. It has declared that if Britain does not provide assistance to the Soviet Union in the Far East, Japan will not change its anti-communist pact into a military alliance treaty. Britain, fearing that Japan might adopt a hostile attitude towards Western European democracies after it signs an agreement with the Soviet Union, remains hesitant. Therefore, the reason why Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been slow to achieve results is ultimately Britain's fault. As for the visit of Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin to Turkey, the result was extremely satisfactory. The two countries have already fully concluded an agreement. In addition, regarding the negotiations between Britain and Turkey, diplomatic sources here say that the negotiations have been successful. Turkey has agreed to participate in a collective security organization, which the Soviet Union has also endorsed.

Istanbul, Turkey: Well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain and Turkey have concluded an agreement to "guarantee peace in the Eastern Mediterranean." The full text of the agreement will be published simultaneously in the capitals of Britain and Turkey on the 8th of this month. All developments have been notified to the Soviet government at any time. (Havas, June 6)

(Paris) The day the Anglo-Turkish agreement on peace in the Eastern Mediterranean was concluded was also the day Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin returned from the Turkish capital. Well-informed sources here commented on this coincidence, saying that Turkey's joining the "Grand Alliance" is in fact endorsed by the Soviet Union, as can be seen from this. The Turkish authorities originally did not want to finalize the negotiations with Britain before the end of the talks among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Now, they have changed their approach and signed the agreement in advance, which must have been facilitated by Deputy Commissar Potemkin. The Soviet Union's unwillingness to pursue a policy of isolation can also be clearly demonstrated from this. (Havas, June 6)

(Paris) The agreement negotiated between Britain and Turkey has recently been concluded. The French government hopes to expand it into a tripartite consultation among Britain, France, and Turkey. However, due to the issue of the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic, there are considerable difficulties. The Turkish authorities are demanding that the region be directly incorporated into Turkey, while according to the 1938 Franco-Turkish agreement, the region should be jointly administered by France and Turkey. However, those in charge of this matter still claim that it should not be difficult to find a satisfactory solution. It is said that France and Turkey are both satisfied. (Havas, June 6)

(London) Last night, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Cabinet decided to submit a memorandum to the Soviet Union, stating that Britain cannot currently accept the Soviet proposal to conclude a military alliance with France and the Soviet Union. British Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately telegraphed this memorandum to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to notify the Soviet Foreign Ministry. It is claimed that the British memorandum clearly states the reasons why Britain cannot currently accept the Soviet plan. Therefore, in theory, it does not block the door to the conclusion of a military alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union. The British government is waiting for the Soviet Union's reply with great urgency, in order to ascertain whether there has been any change in the Soviet Union's foreign policy since Litvinov's dismissal. It is claimed that the British memorandum to the Soviet Union clearly states that if Britain were to immediately conclude a direct military alliance with the Soviet Union, it might affect Britain's relations with Japan, and might also provoke a reaction from anti-communist countries in Europe. However, the British counterproposal stipulates that the Soviet Union's assistance to invaded countries is limited to after Britain and France have already dispatched troops, in order to avoid the Soviet Union being fooled by Britain and France. (Associated Press, June 6)

(London) Diplomatic sources here generally believe that the British government's intention is that Litvinov's removal from office does not mean that the Soviet Union has changed its foreign policy. Otherwise, it would not have submitted another note to the Soviet government. The content of this note has not been disclosed by official sources. According to informed sources, the British government has stated that Poland and Romania are unwilling to openly establish ties with the Soviet Union, lest Germany consider it a provocative move. Therefore, the British government cannot endorse the proposal for a tripartite alliance among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Havas, June 5)

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this morning and held talks. According to well-informed sources, the British counterproposal on the issue of collective security has not yet been sent to the Soviet government, but it will be sent to Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, within a short time. According to reliable sources, the Anglo-Turkish agreement has in fact been concluded, but the government will not formally announce it until negotiations with other countries, including the Soviet government, have been completed. (Havas, June 6)

(London) Political figures here recently stated that the Soviet Union's former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, had proposed that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude an alliance treaty, but this has been rejected by the British government. It is noteworthy that Soviet dictator Stalin may therefore pursue a "policy of isolation." Well-informed sources here say that the British government, while hoping that the Soviet Union will come to the aid of its neighboring countries when Britain and France send troops to assist them, does not want to conclude a general reciprocal alliance treaty with it, and still insists on this position. (Havas, June 6)

(London) British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied in writing to a question from a member of parliament yesterday, stating that the British government does not intend to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Baltic states, namely Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, at present. (Haitong, June 6)

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Leaves Turkey for Home

Stopover in Sofia for a Brief Stay

Sofia, Bulgaria: Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin departed from the Turkish capital last night to return home. He is expected to arrive here at 2:30 pm tomorrow. He will then proceed to the Romanian capital that evening before returning to Moscow. It is reported that Potemkin originally planned to stay here for two days, but the itinerary has been shortened, presumably due to the resignation of the country's People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov. (Havas, June 6)

### German and Italian Foreign Ministers Begin Talks

Milan: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here at 10:55 this morning. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano greeted him at the train station platform, and they drove together to Ribbentrop's hotel. The streets they passed were filled with flags. (Reuters, June 6)

Milan: The German and Italian foreign ministers began talks in the afternoon. It is generally understood that the main topic of discussion is the Polish issue. Germany is eager to know what Italy's attitude will be in the event of a future conflict between Germany and Poland. So far, Italy has only published articles in semi-official newspapers advising the Polish authorities to negotiate with Germany. Observers say that the Polish issue is different from the Sudeten issue, because Italy has always had close relations with Poland, and the Italian government believes that maintaining an independent and free Poland is essential to maintaining the balance of power in Europe. Moreover, Poland's attitude is sufficient to influence the attitudes of Romania and Yugoslavia, which Italy naturally values. In addition, there are still reports that the German and Italian foreign ministers intend to discuss the proposal to transform the "Rome-Berlin Axis" into a military alliance treaty. (Havas, June 6)

### Germany Actively Engages in Political Activities: Lobbies Small Countries to Enhance Its Position; Sends Amorous Glances to the Soviet Union; Attempts to Shatter Britain's Policy of Encirclement

(Berlin) Last night in Berlin, attention was focused not on Foreign Minister Beck's speech, but on the political activities of the Foreign Ministry on Wilhelmstrasse. The Foreign Ministry is currently engaged in European political activities on many fronts, the reaction to which is sufficient to shatter Britain's policy of encirclement. Germany's entire foreign policy is almost entirely directed against Britain, which is becoming increasingly clear. Informed sources admit that Germany's foreign policy may be adjusted to promote this goal. The success of Germany's negotiations with Latvia and Estonia to conclude non-aggression pacts is given great significance here. Germany's non-aggression pacts will be extended to other countries, as some small countries now understand that aligning themselves with democratic countries is a dangerous path to war. Regarding rumors that Germany has begun negotiations with Greece to conclude a non-aggression pact, sources here believe that there is no basis for this, as Greece is a Mediterranean country, which is not in Germany's sphere of political influence. (Haitong, June 6)

(Berlin) Well-informed sources here attach great importance to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy for talks with Foreign Minister Ciano. It is reported that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Milan at 11:00 this morning and will proceed to Cernobbio on the western shore of Lake Como to prepare for talks with Foreign Minister Ciano at the Villa d'Este there tomorrow. When the German and Italian foreign ministers hold talks, they will review the relationship between the Axis countries and the Soviet Union. Official sources here refused to comment on this. It is noteworthy that the *Hamburger Fremdenblatt* published a commentary hinting that the ideological conflict between the Axis countries and the Soviet Union might end after Litvinov's dismissal. The victory in Spain has made the Bolshevik country give up the idea of ​​linking up with democratic countries. The new turn of events is welcomed by German figures. From now on, Germany's peaceful goals can be contrasted with the peaceful goals of the democratic countries. The newspaper concluded its commentary by saying that the Soviet Union's future policy may be to remain isolated, or it should reach a compromise with Germany. (Haitong, June 6)

### Estonia Agrees in Principle to a Non-Aggression Pact with Germany

Tallinn, Estonia: The proposal from the German government to conclude a non-aggression treaty has been approved in principle by the State Council. In addition, Latvian Foreign Minister Munters is scheduled to come here tomorrow to hold talks with government authorities. (Havas, June 5)

### Soviet Supreme Soviet to be Convened on the 25th of this Month

### Litvinov to Study Foreign Literature

(Berlin) According to Berlin's *Tägliche Rundschau*, former Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, after retiring on a pension, plans to specialize in foreign literature at the Soviet National Library. (Haitong, June 6)

### Germany Twice Tempted Poland to Jointly Attack Russia: And Divide Its Territory; But Poland Refused

(Paris) The moderate *L'Ordre*, the Radical-Socialist *L'Ère Nouvelle*, and the right-wing *Le Figaro* all claim that German Head of State Hitler suggested to Poland in March of this year that they jointly attack the Soviet Union and divide its territory. *L'Ère Nouvelle* also states that the Soviet Ukraine and the Transcaucasian republics were intended to be ceded to Germany, while the Little Russian Republic and the Baltic coastal areas would go to Poland. *Le Figaro* also said that when German Aviation Minister General Göring visited the Białowieża Forest in Poland and went hunting with Polish authorities, he was instructed to present this proposal. (Havas, June 6)

Warsaw: After a certain newspaper in Paris revealed the matter of German Head of State Hitler's two proposals to Poland to jointly attack the Soviet Union, well-informed sources here recently confirmed it. The first proposal was made in February of last year when German Aviation Minister General Göring came here for a visit. The second proposal was suggested by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Foreign Minister Beck in January of this year. In both proposals, Germany agreed to cede the Ukrainian province, the Russian province, and part of the land of Lithuania to Poland after defeating the Soviet Union. However, it was rejected by Foreign Minister Beck. After General Göring returned to his country from here in January of last year, the dispute between Poland and Lithuania arose, but fortunately, it did not escalate into an armed conflict. Instead, the two sides restored diplomatic relations, and they have become friends from being enemies. To this day, there is even talk of concluding an alliance treaty. (Havas, June 6)

### Romania Particularly Concerned About Future Soviet Policy

Bucharest: Sources in Bucharest say that Foreign Minister Beck's remarks were firm and dignified, without any accusatory tone, so the door to discussing the issue of Danzig and the corridor on the basis of equality between Germany and Poland has not been closed. However, the issue of future Soviet policy is more important than Beck's remarks. Forty-eight hours have passed since the news of Foreign Minister Litvinov's resignation was announced, but the Soviet Union has not yet made a statement on its future policy. This is significant. It is believed that if Stalin's views are broadly in line with Litvinov's policy, or if he wants to make slight changes to Litvinov's policy in detail, then Moscow should have already issued a statement at this time. (Reuters, June 5)

### Poland and Lithuania Turn Enemies into Friends: Possibility of Concluding an Alliance Treaty

Warsaw: The army newspaper *Polska Zbrojna* recently published an article today hinting at the possibility of Poland and Lithuania concluding an alliance treaty. It stated: "Although Lithuania is a small country, we can regard it as a very reliable ally. The relations between Poland and Lithuania have become increasingly harmonious recently. Lithuania has realized that Poland is its natural ally." It is reported that Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Raštikis is scheduled to come here for a visit on the 8th of this month. Furthermore, when the German government recently proposed to conclude non-aggression agreements with the Nordic countries, it did not inquire about Lithuania. (Havas, June 6)

### British Government Recognizes the Independence of Slovakia

(London) Britain has decided to recognize Slovakia de facto. Reuters has learned that the British Consulate in Bratislava has agreed to Estus, and has been appointed as Consul to Bratislava. Estus has been serving in that position for some time. (Reuters, June 5) It is reported that Slovakia became a German protectorate as a result of Hitler's violation of the Munich Agreement and the partition of Czechoslovakia.

### Southern Regent Scheduled to Visit Rome

(Rome) Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, is scheduled to visit here in mid-month. At that time, the Italian government will hold naval exercises off the coast of Naples and invite him to attend. The King, Prime Minister, and members of the cabinet will all be present to participate in the exercises. The fleet participating in the exercises includes 13 cruisers, 5 destroyer flotillas, and 4 torpedo boat flotillas. (Havas, June 5)

### US Coal Mine Strike Expands: 460,000 Workers Participate in the Strike

The number of striking coal miners in the Appalachian coal region has increased to 460,000. Work has completely stopped today. The joint sub-committee negotiating a solution to the dispute has, after strong appeals from federal mediators, indicated today that it is willing to continue negotiations. At the same time, it is reported that some transportation companies in New York are considering ordering coal from Europe to cope with the emergency in the event of a more serious coal shortage. (Reuters, June 5)

### The British King and Queen Embark on a Tour of Canada: Cheering Crowds Along the Route; The White House to Host a Grand Welcome for the Distinguished Guests

(London) The British King and Queen and the two princesses left Buckingham Palace at 12:18 this afternoon in a four-horse drawn carriage and headed for Waterloo Station. The King, wearing a naval uniform, frequently raised his hand to thank the cheering crowds. The Queen and the two princesses were all dressed in light blue. Behind the royal carriage were several open carriages carrying the entourage. Fifteen minutes later, they arrived at the station. The vehicles of the King and others slowly drove into the station, allowing the crowds who had been waiting for several hours to catch a glimpse of the King and others. Under the glass roof of the station platform were hung the flags of the various dominions and colonies, as well as the American flag. Prime Minister Chamberlain and other cabinet members were at the station to see them off. At 2:10 pm, they arrived in Portsmouth, where the streets were also filled with flags and cheering crowds. The King and his party then boarded the HMCS Empress of Australia and set sail for Canada at 3:00 pm amidst the strains of military music. (Reuters, June 6)

(Washington) Concerns here about the visit of the British King and Queen to the United States are growing. Newspapers are filled with news from Britain and Canada. The public will eagerly study the photos of the Queen, as they will be the standard for American fashion in the future. It is reported that when the King and Queen visit Washington, they will formally meet with the US President and his wife, members of the cabinet, the diplomatic corps, and members of Congress. During their stay in Washington, the King and Queen will reside at the White House as guests of the President and his wife. When the King and Queen travel by car to the White House, they will be escorted by a squadron of cavalry, armored vehicles, and 30 tanks. (Reuters, June 6)

### Accusing Germany of Unilaterally Abrogating the Treaty: Polish Reply Published; Anglo-Polish Agreement Purely Defensive in Nature; Germany's Arguments are Without Merit

Warsaw: After the German government submitted a note on the 28th of last month, declaring the abrogation of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 26, 1934, the Polish government has responded with a memorandum. The content is summarized as follows: The reasons given by the German side are that the mutual guarantees between Britain and Poland are in conflict with the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, but no facts are cited as the basis. If the German government is willing to negotiate, the Polish government is also prepared to sign a treaty with it in the spirit of good neighborliness to resolve mutual relations. Poland is willing to accept any suggestions that Germany may put forward, provided that they respect the views listed in this memorandum. The memorandum begins by stating that the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 was based on the following two principles: (1) Both parties undertake not to use force against each other; (2) All disputes should be resolved by the parties through free negotiations and in a friendly manner. The Polish government anticipated many years ago that the issue of the Free City of Danzig would inevitably cause disputes, and therefore, in good faith, was willing to negotiate with the German government. Germany evaded the matter, merely saying that the relations between the two countries would not be harmed by the issue of Danzig. Head of State Hitler also gave a speech on January 30 of last year, stating that he was willing to respect Poland's interests in the city of Danzig. After the Czech incident occurred in September of last year, the German government began to suggest to Poland that talks should be held on the Danzig issue and the construction of a railway and highway through the corridor. The Polish government did not refuse. As for the note submitted by Germany on April 28 of this year, none of the requirements in it are acceptable to Poland. It is recalled that Poland submitted a note to Germany on March 26 of this year, stating that it was willing to maintain friendly relations with Germany, and was willing to jointly guarantee the city of Danzig, so that the residents of the city could live and work in peace, and the rights and interests held by Poland could also be respected. In addition, various measures that would facilitate railway and highway traffic between Germany's Pomerania Province and East Prussia are willing to be studied, but on the condition that the land through which this route passes remains under Polish sovereignty. This move is in line with the spirit of the 1934 Non-Aggression Pact. However, after one month, no answer was received. It was not until Head of State Hitler gave a speech on April 28 that it was learned that this counterproposal was deemed to be a refusal to negotiate. Yet it is known that what Germany put forward was a unilateral demand, which is in conflict with Poland's national dignity and vital interests, and it is not convenient to answer it, and it cannot be considered to be in line with the spirit of the Non-Aggression Pact. As for the issue of the Slovak state, Germany argues that the independence of Slovakia should be jointly guaranteed by Poland, Germany, and Hungary. In fact, the German government never made this suggestion before Head of State Hitler's speech, and it is even more difficult to reconcile the idea of ​​placing the Slovak state under protection politically and militarily with the proposal of jointly guaranteeing it. The Polish government is not at liberty to make any statement. In addition, Germany's interpretation of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact is that Poland should relinquish its right to conclude political agreements with third countries, in other words, to give up its independent and autonomous foreign policy. How can Poland accept this? Germany's foreign policy in recent years has not bound itself with this kind of interpretation. What one does not want for oneself, how can one impose it on others? At the time when the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact was concluded, Germany had already recognized that the Franco-Polish alliance treaty was only defensive in nature and did not conflict with it. Now that the mutual guarantees between Britain and Poland are also defensive in nature and do not threaten Germany, why should it be considered to be in violation of the German-Polish Pact? In addition, the German-Polish Pact is based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact of August 27, 1928. Poland will only take action in accordance with the Anglo-Polish Pact when Germany threatens Britain, which also means violating the German-Polish Pact of the Paris Pact, and there will be no reason to give others an excuse. Based on the above, Germany's unilateral abrogation of the German-Polish Pact has no facts to rely on. The term of this treaty is ten years, and it will not expire until 1944, and it does not contain any provisions for unilateral abrogation. (Havas, June 5)

### Various Reactions to Foreign Minister Beck's Speech: Britain and France Acknowledge the Tone as Moderate and Firm, Germany Deeply Dissatisfied Due to Rejection of Proposal, Italy Advises Poland Not to Be Obstinate and Bring Trouble Upon Itself

London

London is currently carefully studying Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech. While the impression is generally positive, it is widely known that there has been no official statement yet. According to diplomatic circles, Beck's speech has both moderate and firm characteristics. The reaction of Germany is what diplomatic circles are currently focused on. However, the Chairman of the Danzig Senate, Greiser, and the leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Forster, are both at Hitler's villa, indicating that Germany's response will not be delayed for long. Recalling the events in Czechoslovakia, Greiser's presence in Berchtesgaden will have special significance. According to diplomatic circles, Beck's comments on the unilateral cancellation of the German-Polish non-aggression pact should serve as a warning to countries currently receiving German proposals to conclude similar non-aggression agreements. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)

(London) The speech delivered yesterday by Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has been praised by all newspapers here. They all said that the door to negotiations between Germany and Poland is still open. The Times stated, "Foreign Minister Beck's wording is firm, but there is absolutely no intention of provocation. Regarding the relationship between Germany and Poland, it is undoubtedly possible to seek solutions through diplomatic channels. The key is for both parties to exercise reason calmly, and then there will be no problem in finding a solution to the Free City of Danzig issue. Conversely, if the two countries resort to war due to disputes, a small spark will inevitably ignite a prairie fire, and no one will be able to save it." The Daily Mail stated, "Whether French or British, almost no one wants to sacrifice their lives for the Danzig issue." The Manchester Guardian took a slightly different stance, issuing a warning and advocating for abandoning appeasement attempts. Its words stated, "If Germany is allowed to do what it wants, and Danzig is militarily controlled, becoming a base for German land, sea, and air forces, then the country will become the master of Poland, just as Germany occupied the Sudetenland in October of last year and then became the master of Czechoslovakia. This should be prevented. If there are still people talking about 'appeasement' at this point, it is tantamount to encouraging Germany to believe that there is no consistent support within Britain for a firm policy, and this alone is enough to increase the risk of war." (Havas dispatch on the 6th)

Paris

Those in Paris believe that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech in the lower house was moderate, firm, and statesmanlike. The section on Danzig can be seen as a rejection of German proposals, but the wording is such that no one can accuse it of being provocative. It is rumored that Italy is currently using its influence to seek a peaceful solution to the German-Polish issue. Therefore, the public now hopes that Germany will use this moderate language to peacefully resolve the issue. According to general opinion, the firmness of Polish Foreign Minister's speech, coupled with the new declaration from Britain and France pledging to help Poland resist aggression, should make Germany understand that democratic countries are not merely making empty promises. If Germany intends to use the same tactics against the Baltic region as it did against Czechoslovakia, it will inevitably lead to a European war. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)

Washington

Authoritative figures in Washington have a very good impression of Foreign Minister Beck's speech. Although Beck's response to Hitler yesterday did not close the door to reconciliation, it is believed here that this speech is sufficient to express Poland's consistent and strong national sovereignty and is consistent with its recent near-war state. The government stated that the final confirmation of relations between Germany and Poland here cannot be based solely on verbal statements and should be determined by the actions of the two countries. (Washington) The general public here originally felt uneasy about the issue of the Free City of Danzig. However, after Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's speech in the House of Representatives today, they were greatly relieved. Diplomatic figures here also said that Foreign Minister Beck's words were firm, courageous, and appropriate, and that his agreement to conduct negotiations with Germany in a peaceful atmosphere and on the basis of absolute equality is completely in line with the feelings of the majority of Americans. The American view is that international issues cannot be resolved unless the authorities of all related countries truly intend to consolidate peace. At this point, the key to the problem lies in whether Germany intends to cooperate faithfully with other countries to maintain peace in Europe or whether it will continue to pursue policies under a threatening atmosphere. The speech delivered by Foreign Minister Beck today and the remarks made by French Prime Minister Daladier to the press yesterday have similar results through different methods. Both of them are based on the basic theory revealed by President Roosevelt, which is commendable. Since they have neither closed the door to negotiations nor urged German leader Hitler to abandon the means of intimidation through power, it can be seen that European countries have established a good foundation for a collective security system. Germany's strategy of using propaganda to alienate countries will undoubtedly fail. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

Berlin

Regarding the speech delivered by Beck in parliament yesterday, authoritative figures here said that it was a purely negative rejection of the German proposal. Poland has resolutely rejected the proposal of Head of State Hitler to adjust relations between the two countries. In addition, the aggressive demands in Polish newspapers and the mobilization of Polish troops indicate that Poland is not prepared to resolve the German-Polish dispute peacefully. Authoritative figures here criticized Beck's speech on three points: (1) Beck did not announce the truth of the matter. It should be noted that Germany proposed to Poland several months ago. In January of this year, when Beck met Hitler in Teschen and later met Ribbentrop in Munich, he made this proposal, not only after Mr. Xi delivered a speech recently. (2) Beck did not explain Poland's measures, that is, Beck avoided mentioning the mobilization of Polish troops and the upsurge of the anti-German movement. (3) Beck's reasons for rejecting the proposal are insufficient. Regarding the Danzig issue, Beck stated that Poland cannot abandon Danzig because the port is Poland's only port for exporting goods. It should be noted that Hitler has already acknowledged this and proposed a free zone to solve it in his proposal. Why didn't Beck's speech mention this proposal? Regarding the road construction issue in the Polish Corridor, Beck said that most of the residents in the area are Poles. In fact, since 1919, the number of Germans in the area has increased to one million. In short, authoritative figures in Berlin believe that the Polish Foreign Minister's speech has failed to alleviate the existing tensions and has not opened up new doors for negotiations.

Rome

The Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia published a critique by Guido about Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech, warning Poland not to adopt an excessive anti-German stance and advising Poland to consider its own interests and not be exploited by other countries. It also stated that the solution to the problem of Teschen and the common Polish-Hungarian border, which benefited Poland, depended on Mussolini's intervention and Italy's actions. Poland should not forget this. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)

(Rome) Piccolo newspaper reported today that Italy wants Germany and Poland to express moderation equally. Because only when all parties abandon the desire to establish hegemony can the path of justice be reached. Now that both parties have declared peace, they have already half reached a compromise.

### The Issue of the Tripartite Military Alliance: The Opposition in Japan Is Gradually Gaining Ground, London Believes That There Is Hope for Improving Relations Between Britain and Japan, Arita Uses "Benevolent Rule" as a Gimmick to Deceive the Powers

(London) British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday. Although the details are unknown, well-informed sources here claim that the situation is quite good. The faction in Japan that does not want to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance is gradually gaining ground, so there is great hope for improving relations between Britain and Japan. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

(New York) Regarding the relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the New York newspaper Minsheng Bao recently commented on it with the title "Frustration and Tyranny." It stated that Japan's rejection of Germany and Italy's proposal to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance agreement "is certainly welcomed by the world, but the cabinet's decision to do so is actually contrary to the military authorities stationed in China and the powerful forces within the country who support the military alliance. After suffering repeated setbacks in China, the former faction has taken the risk. The leader of the latter faction, General Oshima, the ambassador to Germany, will certainly be dissatisfied with this decision. Therefore, unless those who support Japan as its backing overthrow the current cabinet to save face, General Oshima will not be at ease in his position. In addition, the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai are preparing to create a highly explosive situation in order to drive their government to conclude a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. The spokesperson of the Japanese army there made a statement on the 2nd of this month, stating that if the Japanese army had not protected the Shanghai International Settlement in 1937 (when the August 13th Shanghai War broke out), it would have ceased to exist long ago. This statement is a strong hint, indicating that it is not difficult for irresponsible elements to cause incidents. It is hoped that these impatient elements can be a little less impetuous, so that with the passage of time, their minds may become a little calmer, or they can find a safer way to preserve their face during the slow progress of diplomatic negotiations, which is a good plan." (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita said at the general meeting of the Federation of International Affairs last night that the important point of Japan's policy is completely based on the fundamental moral principle of making China and Manchuria live together in satisfaction and peace. Arita mentioned Japan's relationship with Germany and Italy, saying that the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact is the axis of Japan's foreign policy. This is Japan's unwavering policy, so Japan earnestly hopes that Germany and Italy, the signatories of the pact, will achieve common development in accordance with their respective national policies. Japan's relations with Germany and Italy are increasingly strengthened in both cultural and economic aspects. Manchuria, Hungary, and Spain have successively joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, so there are now six countries that have signed the pact. The current situation in the world seems to force the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and several other countries are expected to join soon. Spain was once in danger of becoming communist, but fortunately, it was spared due to its spirit of anti-communism. This point is worth noting. The destructive activities of the Communist Party in China have increased rather than decreased and have become a major cause of the China Incident, forcing Japan to conclude the Anti-Comintern Pact. Japan's ultimate goal is to establish a new order in East Asia in accordance with the fundamental moral principle of "Benevolent Rule" and along the lines of its independent policy. The so-called "Benevolent Rule" is unique to Japan and is completely different from totalitarianism or democracy. Japan is now following the lines of its independent policy and the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact and is striving to promote the peace and prosperity of East Asia. The purpose of Japan's policy is to cooperate with various countries in the East to seek the prosperity of each country and world peace based on moral principles. Japan is now working to elevate China from its current "semi-colonial situation" to the position of a complete and independent country based on moral principles. Foreign countries seem to fear that the economic activities of third countries in China will be excluded by Japan's fundamental policy, but this kind of fear is useless. Japan has no intention of excluding foreign interests, and in fact, this kind of step is indeed impossible. (Reuters on the 5th)

### The Pope Cares About European Peace

The pope is exerting efforts to mediate the conflict between Germany and Poland.

(Paris) French Foreign Minister Bonnet reported at the cabinet meeting this morning on the Pope's efforts to maintain European peace, because Bonnet met with the Vatican's envoy to France, Rensiwo, yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 6th)

(Rome) According to semi-official sources today, the Pope is trying to find a peaceful solution to the Poland-Germany issues. If both Germany and Poland express their welcoming, then the Pope will mediate the Poland-Germany problems in a friendly manner. The Vatican's envoy to Germany, Orsenigo, recently visited Mr. Xi, although this action relates to the European conflicts, semi-official personnel thinks that Orsenigo was once for the Germany-Poland issues.

### Japanese Troops Invade Heshan in Three Routes

Japanese planes bomb Heshan City, which has become scorched earth. Japanese troops also attack Gaoming from the north of Heshan, vainly hoping to encircle Zhaoqing with a roundabout strategy.

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army has recently made major reinforcements. The reinforcements from Taiwan have just arrived in Guangzhou and have been divided into Zengcheng and Fuhexu in Dongjiang to guard the outer perimeter of Guangzhou above Shitan. A part of them rushed to Jiangcun in Beijiang. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Foshan were also ordered to open to Sanshui Mian, etc. nearby. The trains traveling north and west from Guangzhou have been very busy transporting supplies for days. In addition, a large part of the Japanese army concentrated in Rongqi Guizhou, Shunde, with four or five thousand people, used hundreds of motorboats to cross the river to the west bank from the inland river, dividing into three routes to attack Heshan County, with the goal of the county seat. The assembly of each unit was completed before April 25, and the invasion began on the 26th. One route crossed the river from Jiujiang Heqing, Nanhai, and attacked Gulao, Heshan. One route went west from Xinhui, occupied Duruan Pingling, and attacked the eastern suburbs of Heshan. One route went around Danshuikou, which belonged to Kaiping, and detoured north to peek at the south of Heshan City. Among the three routes, the Danshuikou route had the least troops. Once they landed in Danshuikou, they were defeated by the Chinese army on the front line in Kaiping. The Xinhui Duruan route had more troops, but it was controlled by the Xinhui Heshan Road Chinese army and was difficult to advance. As for the Japanese army that advanced southward from Jiujiang to Gulao to meet Shaping and attack Heshan City, it seemed to be the main force, with no less than 5,000 people. Once the Japanese army's deployment was set, they used the trick of feinting east and attacking west, using some motorboats to carry marines to attack Danshuikou as a restraint, and then using most of the troops to advance westward along the Pingling Duruan of Xinhui Heshan Road. The Chinese regular army, believing that the Pingling area was the outer line to defend Heshan, had to deploy considerable troops there. When the Japanese troops in Pingling moved on the 27th, the Chinese artillery exerted its power and switched to the offensive. In the morning of the 27th, the two sides were extremely engaged, and at 2 pm, three artillery fortresses of the Japanese army in Pingling were blown up, and Pingling was captured, heading straight to Jinggen Duruan, which was about to approach Xinhui City. The Japanese army used multiple planes to support them and bombarded the advancing Chinese troops. Because the Chinese army had no fortifications to defend, they automatically withdrew to the east of Pingling to block the Japanese army's westward advance after annihilating hundreds of Japanese troops.

When the Japanese army invaded Heshan City in three routes, when the Danshuikou and Xinhui Heshan Road routes were moving, the Japanese army in the Jiujiang Heqing area also crossed the river at the same time and captured Gulao and Shaping in Heshan, and passed Longkouxu to attack the back of Heshan City. At that time, the local militia was outnumbered and had to move to a new position after fierce fighting. Japanese planes continued to bomb the rear of Heshan, and the Chinese army withdrew from the suburbs and waited for reinforcements. On the 28th, the two sides fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army in Jingang and other places in Longkou Township in the north of the city. At that time, the Chinese army had arrived from Gaoming and other places to join the counterattack, and a part of them detoured Kunlun Mountain and attacked the Japanese army from the side. The gains and losses of the above strongholds were determined several times, and after a day and night of hardship, the Japanese army in Heshan City was defeated in the morning of the 29th. 3,000 Japanese troops suffered heavy losses in Jingang, with 600 to 700 casualties. The rest fled back to Heqing Jiujiang. As for a part of the Japanese army that detoured from Shaping, it was intercepted by the Chinese army after crossing Shaping five miles, and more than 100 cavalry were lost. The Chinese army captured a large cannon and retreated in embarrassment to Haikou. Heshan City was devastated after being ravaged by the Japanese army. The central area of the city was bombarded by 40 to 50 giant bombs dropped by Japanese planes, and the bombed areas have become mounds. The suffering of the county people is countless. The refugees fled out of the city, wandering and starving, in a very miserable state.

After Heshan City was recovered by the Chinese army on the 29th, the Japanese army's ambition was still not suppressed. They continued to transfer teams from Jiujiang and Shunde to reinforce them. According to reports, the Japanese army has a momentum to come back. It plans to have the Japanese army on Xinhui Heshan Road take the main attack, and launch a fierce attack on the east of Heshan City from Pingling Duruan. It will also increase troops to go north along the He Kai Highway from Danshuikou to attack the south of Heshan City. At the same time, thousands of people took the road to Gulao, peeped at Sanzhou, and invaded the border of Gaoming County, attempting to encircle Zhaoqing along the Yaoming Highway. This move is worth noting, because if the Japanese army in this area succeeds in the roundabout, the Chinese army on the east and west banks of the Xijiang will be greatly threatened. In recent days, the Chinese army has stepped up fortifications on this line and transferred thousands of strong men from Guangxi to the front line to assist in the attack and defense. The Yaoming Highway has been completely destroyed from Sanzhou to the north, and it will not be easy for the Japanese army to fly over it.

### Changsha Residents Evacuate Westward for the Second Time

The authorities are deploying to defend against the Japanese army's invasion, and relief work is still ongoing.

According to the Continental Daily, Pastor Tyne of the American Church in Changsha, accompanied by his wife, who is about to return to the United States, toured western China and later came to Shanghai. Yesterday (the 5th), he told reporters that Changsha is now in terror again. The transportation lines leading into the city from the north and east have been cut off by the military authorities to prevent a possible Japanese invasion. When Pastor Tyne left the Changsha Church in mid-April, the political and civilian circles were quite concerned about the intentions of the Japanese army in central China. Ordered by the provincial government, the residents of Changsha have already begun their second evacuation westward since the fall, and every day, thousands of people, carrying their belongings, swarm out of the city, taking to the Xiang River south to Xiangtan, and then turning west into the Lian River to Xiangxiang, and then heading west. The roads leading into Changsha are already impassable. The rails of the Yue Han Road on the Yangtze River between Yueyang and Changsha have been completely removed from the roadbed. Although the railway north of Changsha has been destroyed, the railway south of Changsha still facilitates the people with excellent service. These trains run on time every day, carrying passengers from Changsha south to Hengyang and other places. A large number of goods are often carried back to Changsha by this train. Although there is good railway service, there is still a shortage of major goods in Changsha, such as soap and other sanitary products. Pastor Tyne's wife runs a small soap factory in the city, where refugees work to provide relief. Although it is difficult to obtain the necessary raw materials, the soap is sold out as soon as it is produced. Although the provincial government has ordered an evacuation, relief work is still ongoing, mostly carried out by the Changsha International Relief Committee. Tyne is the director of publicity for the committee. The committee's working funds come from the National Relief Association and the International Red Cross, among others. After the fire in November last year, the national government allocated 100,000 yuan to the committee to carry out the city's reconstruction work. Shortly before the Tyne couple left Changsha on April 7, the city suffered its first air raid after the great fire. Although there were only two Japanese planes carrying out this destructive mission, the temporary houses built around the church were bombed into rubble. One bomb was thrown into the church, less than an arrow's distance from Tyne's residence. Fortunately, no one was injured. The two of them took a train from Changsha to Shaoguan and changed to a car east to Shantou. The roads in Guangdong Province also took similar precautions as the roads leading into Changsha. They took a coastal ship from Shantou to Shanghai. Now Tyne has not yet decided where to go, but his wife is scheduled to return to her home in Boston within two months to meet her three children who are studying in the United States.

### Wang Dezhou, Leader of the Chedu Township Militia in Songjiang, is Assassinated

The Murderer is Suspected to Be a Bandit

Songjiang Correspondence: Wang Dezhou, the leader of the Chedu Township Militia in the first district of the county, was spotted by a disciple of Wang Wenlong when he was passing through Sanlintang, Pudong, in the evening of the 5th. So he and a few accomplices followed him. When they reached a quiet area, they shot Wang to death. Fearing that the incident would be leaked, the disciples threw Wang's body into the river. According to those familiar with Wang's background, Wang was originally from Sichuan and had served in the military and political circles for many years. Since 1935, he had lived in Chedu Township, married a woman from the Gu family in the township, and opened a South China goods store to make a living. Since the Japanese army occupied Song City, Wang continued to operate his business. Later, because the local area was unstable and bandits continued to run rampant, kidnapping occurred from time to time. Wang's store was robbed several times. Out of anger, he organized a militia to protect the local area, which was hated by the bandits. Therefore, he encountered this unfortunate incident.

### Fierce Battles in the Border Areas of Pinghu, Shan, and Songjiang Counties

The Japanese army was lured to death and injury in large numbers, and the heads of the propaganda class and teams were killed in battle.

Pinghu Correspondence: The Japanese army, entrenched in the four places of Songshan Fengping, led by the traitorous road protection committee members, set out by land and water to attack the Chinese army. When they arrived at Chaonitan Town, which belonged to Songjiang County, the 　　　 division of the Chinese army, together with the 　　　 brigade Tian Tuan, used a small number of troops to lure them deep. When they arrived at Wutongmiao Town, they surrounded them on all sides and fierce battles broke out. The Japanese army in Songjiang, hearing the news, urgently sent reinforcements to Xintai to join the battle. For three days and three nights, a Japanese motorboat loaded with bullets was blown up in the Chaonitan area by the Chinese army. The Japanese army could not resist due to the depletion of bullets. Fujiwara, the head of the Japanese propaganda class in Jiashan, and Moriya, the captain of the Japanese squad in Songjiang, were killed in battle. Several other Japanese officers of the same rank were also missing. The Japanese army in Jiashan Fengjing was almost completely wiped out, with only four or five survivors. The 　　division of the Chinese army captured 78 soldiers from Songjiang. The Japanese army stationed in Xintai Town also suffered heavy casualties. The newly appeared puppet maintenance association chairman in the town was also beheaded by the Chinese army. At the same time, the Chinese army in Wutongmiao Town lured the Japanese army to Datongqiao Town, and street battles broke out in the town. As a result, people could not escape, and hundreds of people were killed and injured. The houses and shops in the town were reduced to ashes. The villages three or four miles away from the town, as well as Wutongmiao Town, suffered the same disaster. In addition, the Japanese army abandoned countless military supplies, and the bodies of Japanese soldiers could not be transported away. The Japanese army was furious and lured the traitors among the road protection teams with heavy money to guide them in searching the suburbs and killing innocent civilians to vent their anger.

### Hangzhou National Goods Store Manager, Zhu Fusheng Arrested for Tearing Down Slogans

Hangzhou Correspondence: Zhu Fusheng, manager of the National Goods Store in this city, is 52 years old. After Hangzhou fell, he took his family to seek refuge elsewhere. Later, due to livelihood issues, he hurriedly returned to Hangzhou in the autumn to resume his old business. However, he was very dissatisfied with the puppet government's measures and had scolded them several times, but the puppet authorities had no evidence and did not punish him. On the 1st of this month, the puppet "Great People's Assembly" posted absurd slogans everywhere on the main streets. The walls of the National Goods Store were also plastered with them. Zhu happened to see them and personally tore them down. This was seen by the puppet police there, who, without asking the reason, arrested Zhu and detained him in the puppet police station. Initially, he was not allowed to meet friends or relatives. Later, after Zhu's wife went around to plead, family members were allowed to visit. It is said that in the detention center, Zhu's hands were handcuffed, his feet were shackled, and his body was covered with wounds, so that he could not sit or stand. His wife, seeing this, could not help but weep, and was driven out by the puppet police. But Zhu remained calm and gave his wife a stirring speech, roughly saying, "I am now over fifty, what is there to regret about death? I only ask that you command our children not to forget the nation, not to forget for whom I am dying," and so on. His wife, hearing these words, wanted to offer comfort but was quickly pushed out the door. Subsequently, his wife asked someone to intervene, spending a large sum of money to secure his release. After Zhu was released, he learned of the intervention and scolded his entire family endlessly, saying it was wrong.

### Rice Market Resumes Business Yesterday, Trading According to Price Limits, Most Hoarders Dump Stock, Market Stabilized, Strict Supervision Enforced to Prevent Backroom Manipulation

Shanghai Market Has Ample Rice Stocks, Over 800,000 Bags

The rice price in this city, after a joint meeting of seven rice industry groups, was allowed to be raised to 15 yuan due to source obstacles and heavy taxes. The market resumed yesterday morning, and all brokers traded according to the limit. The market also sent inspectors to the venue to pay attention to manipulation and backroom deals, so as to strictly enforce the rules. Rice industry representatives are scheduled to visit the Concession authorities tomorrow to report on the change in rice prices and actively encourage brokers and merchants to clear the source. When necessary, each group will plan to stabilize rice prices to maintain the people's food supply. The details of each situation are recorded below.

Public Announcement of Price Limit

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association posted a public notice at the market, stating, "Regarding the public notice, the Association convened a joint meeting of various rice industry groups on the 5th of this month, including rice shops, rice milling industry, Changshu Rice Industry Association, Nanbang Association, rice retailers, and rice transport merchants' association, to jointly discuss how to handle the recent high rice prices, which have far exceeded the limit. It was resolved (omission in the middle)... Considering the situation, the highest price for white japonica rice and Yangxian rice is set at 15 yuan per dan, and the highest price for Kexian rice is set at 14 yuan per dan. Each rice must be strictly graded to take care of the people's livelihood. For goods traded before today, if the price is above 15 yuan, the settlement should also be made at 15 yuan per dan. No return of tickets is allowed for traded rice," and so on. The record is on file. The case is recorded urgently and announced, so that all brokers must abide by it. This is hereby announced.

Market Reopens

After the Rice Market Management Committee was forced to suspend the market due to sudden and drastic changes in market transactions on the morning of the 5th, it immediately followed the resolution of the joint meeting of rice industry groups to relax the price limit, and reopened the market at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. All merchants and traders were able to stabilize their minds after the market was slightly relaxed and the penalty methods were determined. The number of transactions between buyers and sellers was balanced and orderly, and trading was conducted within the limit. The chaotic situation was swept away. From the opening to the closing of the market, the total transaction volume reached more than 11,000 bags, of which 60-70% were dumped by (hoarding households), and 20-30% were traded between merchants and traders.

Supervising Manipulation

In order to implement the penalty measures and stabilize the market, the Market Management Committee specifically appointed the original management committee members Gu Yisheng, Wang Tianqiu, Hu Bokang, and the trader representatives Shi Zufuku and Zhang Songtao to be responsible for inspection. They will pay attention to whether there are backroom transactions between merchants, between shops, or between peers, and whether peers with thicker capital are borrowing brokers from peers to absorb and manipulate large amounts. Once discovered, they will report to the management committee and strictly implement the penalty fees, without favoritism, in order to maintain public business and eliminate malpractices.

Letter Explaining Process

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Branch sent letters to the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, the French Concession Board of Directors, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Respectfully, our Association convened a joint meeting of various rice industry groups on the 5th of this month to discuss how to handle the recent high rice prices in Shanghai, which have far exceeded the limit. It was resolved that the original price limit set by our Association, which should not exceed 14 yuan per dan for the highest quality white rice, was maintained by various rice industry groups for more than a year. However, recently, there have been many obstacles in the source of rice. For example, only five trucks of rice are transported from Wuxi to Shanghai every day, totaling 625 bags. Suzhou is limited to 40,000 bags per month. The price of rice in Changshu and other places is higher than that in Shanghai. Rice boats from Nanbang are blocked by the rice market ferry. Various places in the suburbs of Shanghai are purchasing from Shanghai. As for the Yangtze River area, the price of rice in Wuhu has risen, and taxes have been added. Nanjing cannot transport rice to Shanghai. The source is scarce, and the stock is gradually reduced, resulting in high prices, which have far exceeded the limit. Reported that the recent high-quality rice has risen to more than 15 yuan. If there is no restriction and no remedy for a long time, it will greatly affect the people's food supply. The joint meeting of various rice industry groups solemnly discussed that maintaining the limit is impossible due to the facts, and the production price in the inland is high and the taxes are heavy. Merchants have suffered a lot of losses, so they have to take care of it in order to increase the source (omission in the middle). The case is recorded and communicated, so I hope you will check and record it. The association is scheduled to send representatives to visit the authorities of the two concessions and the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow to detail the process of changing the rice price limit and inquire about the opinions of the authorities.

Ample Rice Stocks

Regarding the rice stocks in various silver money industries, pawnshops, and brokers in this city, according to the results of the four surveys by the Evaluation Committee, there are still more than 610,000 bags. However, according to sources, the total amount of rice in Shanghai is more than this number. Among them, it has fallen into the hands of private non-industry people, and the exact number cannot be investigated. The large one is always more than 800,000 bags, so there is no panic about the people's food supply. According to the reporter, the current Bean and Rice Industry Association Market Management Committee, in addition to sending letters to the industry in various producing areas to try to clear the source as much as possible, and mouth-neck persuade various brokers, although there are multiple obstacles in the inland, for the sake of the future of Shanghai citizens' food, increase the transport.

Difficulty in Stabilizing Prices

When the rice industry groups held a joint meeting on the 5th of this month, the Rice Shop Industry Association suggested that, in view of the soaring rice prices and the impact on the people's food supply, the prices should be stabilized to maintain the livelihood of the general public. A number of stabilization points will be set up in the two concessions, and the highest price will be limited per dan, and the daily sales volume will be limited. The losses of stabilizing the price will be subsidized by donations from high-quality rice. Before the meeting, the suggestion was exchanged privately, and it was considered that the current price of rice is high, and there is no sufficient and huge preparation for stabilizing the price of rice. The matter is very important and it is very difficult to realize, so it will be temporarily abandoned and considered again when it is necessary in the future.

### Hanging Flags in the Concessions, Japanese Consul Raises Objections

Sends Note to the Authorities of the Two Concessions Demanding a Ban on Hanging the Chinese Flag

The "North-China Daily News" reported that the Japanese Consul General Miura sent a strongly worded note to the French Consul General Baudez and the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, Fan Keling, yesterday (the 5th), demanding a complete ban on hanging the Chinese flag in the Public Concession and the French Concession. According to a press release issued by the Japanese Consulate last night, Miura said that the authorities of the two concessions allowed the national flag to be hung for eight days a year, which was unacceptable. Miura also said that allowing the flag to be hung was tantamount to the administrative organs of the two foreign-controlled areas recognizing the power of a government that was far from Chongqing and had lost its jurisdiction. He also said that the foreign authorities agreed with the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people. His reason for demanding a ban on hanging the flag was that it was necessary to maintain peace and order in the Public Concession and the French Concession.

### Chief Inspector of the French Police, Cao Bingsheng, Assassinated Yesterday, Hit by Four Bullets in Vital Spots, Died in the Afternoon After Surgery Due to Inflammation

Suspects Arrested, Stray Bullets Injured Three People

A bloody case occurred in the French Concession yesterday morning. The main figure in this bloody case was Cao Bingsheng, the Chinese Inspector of the Political Department of the French Police. He was shot by several thugs on the way. Cao was hit by three bullets and died at Guangci Hospital at 4:30 p.m. The detailed information of the case is recorded below.

Encountered Danger on the Way Out from Home

The incident occurred at around 7:50 a.m. yesterday. Cao was taking a chartered car from his residence at No. 5 Shuanglongfang, Lane 172, West Aichengs Road, Ladu Road, to the police station to work. Cao was wearing a Western suit, and his driver, A San, from Changzhou, was pulling the car forward. Unexpectedly, when he was about 20 houses away from his home, at the entrance of Dafu Noodle Restaurant at No. 162, four thugs suddenly jumped out from the roadside. They were all wearing short clothes. Two of them stepped forward to hold the car shafts so that they could not move forward. The other two dragged the car canopy from behind, and at the same time, they pulled out their pistols and fired at Cao.

Cao Hit by Four Bullets, Injured Pedestrians

Cao was caught off guard and was hit by four bullets. Two bullets hit the upper part of the left and right breasts, but did not pass through. One bullet grazed the skin on the right side of the neck, and one bullet hit the back of the neck, passed through the chest, and entered the lungs. Blood flowed like a fountain, and he fell to the ground wounded. Seeing this, the thugs were about to escape. One of them ran towards Ganshi East Road. The nearby patrolmen had already heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene. The Yue patrolman at No. 435 first pursued the thugs. The thugs also opened fire to resist arrest. There was a burst of gunfire, and the two sides fired more than 20 shots in total. As a result, Wang Tingsheng, a young man from Tianjin, was injured by a bullet. At the same time, two maids, Chen Zhangshi and Xu Shi, were injured by stray bullets.

Car Sent to Guangci Hospital for Emergency Treatment

When Cao fell to the ground in a pool of blood, the driver A San rushed back home to report to Cao's wife, Sun. She rushed to the scene, but there was no car line nearby, so she stopped a car passing by and sent Cao to Guangci Hospital. At the same time, the French police also received the news and immediately sent an ambulance and a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to rescue and capture. The pedestrians hit by stray bullets were sent to the hospital.

Bullets Entered Abdomen, Blood Transfusion, Surgery

After Cao was sent to Guangci Hospital, he was transferred to the No. 1 superior ward on the upper floor of the eastern part of the hospital, near the escalator. Important personnel of the French Police and the French Superintendent General Fabre all visited him in person. His relatives and friends also rushed to express their condolences. At 10:10 a.m., because Cao had lost too much blood, his family members gave him a blood transfusion of 500CC. Cao was very conscious, but the doctor said that the bullet that hit Cao's right shoulder on the back had passed through the lungs and entered the abdomen, and it was necessary to perform surgery to remove the bullet. The family members agreed, and at 11:05 a.m., Cao was carried to the operating room. X-rays were taken first, and the official operation was performed at 12:30 p.m. The process was quite good.

Died Untreatably, Funeral on the 8th

After the surgery, at about 2:00 p.m., Cao suddenly felt weak, exhausted, and had difficulty breathing. The doctor also said that his bullet wounds had injured his lungs and intestines, so he used oxygen to help him breathe. But in the end, due to inflammation in his body, his injuries changed dramatically, and he died at 4:30 p.m. Everyone was shocked to hear the news. Cao's body has been sent to the Shanghai Funeral Home, and a funeral committee has been set up. The funeral will be held at 1:00 p.m. on the 8th, and the funeral will be held at 2:00 p.m. Last night, the police also thoroughly investigated the case because Cao was killed, which was a major case, and instructed all detectives to pay attention to detecting and arresting the murderer in order to solve the case.

Pursuit of Murderers, Stray Bullets Injured People

When the Yue patrolmen were shooting and chasing the murderers, because the stray bullets were flying, Wang Tingsheng, a young man from Tianjin, and Chen Zhangshi and Xu Shi, a maid who bought vegetables, were injured. They were sent to the hospital by the police for treatment, and the injuries were not serious. When the Yue patrolmen and the murderers were fighting, Wang Shaokun (age 19, from Shandong, living at No. 22 Kuanyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge), an accomplice of the murderer, was hit by several bullets and fell to the ground injured. He was captured and taken to the police station for questioning. It is said that he has admitted to participating in the assassination of Cao. The police sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the police sent out a passing detectives and notified the Public Police Station to investigate and arrest the fugitives and bring them to justice.

Impoverished After Death, Commentators Regret

Cao was a native of Wuxi, 30 years old, with a wife, Sun, 26 years old, and a daughter, Cici, who is now four years old. Cao was very amiable and knowledgeable. He was indeed a capable talent in the French Police. In the past, he served as a translator in the Political Department, and then he was promoted to inspector. After the August 13th Incident, he worked very hard to handle the relief of the refugee area, and his achievements were remarkable. He was specially promoted to medical inspector. However, he was always fair in handling affairs and did not accept favors from others, and he was also happy to do good deeds, so his salary was only enough to cover his expenses, so he had no savings. His relatives, friends, and colleagues all regretted him very much. It is said that a few months ago, a terrorist group from the puppet government once sent people to his lane to try to harm Cao, but fortunately it was detected in advance, and several criminals were caught.

Recently Received Two Warning Letters

It is certain that at a certain time last year, when the "Huangdao Society" was rampant in terrorist activities, the puppet government secretly sent terrorist bandits to Cao's residence near West Ai Xian Si Road to plot to assassinate Cao. At that time, the Prime Minister got the report in advance and captured several people on the spot. After the investigation, they confessed that they were instructed by the puppet government. However, the police did not publish it at that time, and Cao himself did not pay attention to it afterwards. Until recently, a month ago, Cao received two warning letters from a certain party in succession. Cao also ignored them. He did not expect that the disaster would happen at his elbow and he would eventually suffer a poisonous hand.

Police Superintendent General Weeps in Sorrow

After Cao died in the hospital, Mr. Fei Bai'er, the police superintendent general of the French Police, was extremely saddened and wept again and again. Mr. Fei said to people at the time that since the European War, Cao was the first person he had mourned so much that he shed tears with his colleagues. Cao was young, honest, and loyal to his duties. He was indeed one of the most promising police officers in the French Police in the future. Unfortunately, this tragic change has caused endless mourning. From this, it can be seen how deeply Cao was loved during his lifetime.

### Silk Factories Shut Down Due to Exhaustion of Raw Materials, Spring Cocoons Begin to Enter the Market

"Huazhong Company" Abandons Control of Township Cocoon Shops

Shanghai silk factories have successively shut down due to the exhaustion of raw materials. Spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have begun to enter the market. "Huazhong Company" has abandoned the control of township cocoon shops. Banks and money houses refuse to lend money, and insurance companies refuse to insure various risks. Manufacturers regard collecting cocoons in the occupied areas as a dangerous path. The details are recorded as follows.

Silk Factories Shut Down Due to Exhaustion of Raw Materials

After the war, silk manufacturers in the four suburbs of Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiaxing, and other places refused to cooperate with the Japanese and set up new factories in the Shanghai Concession area. By the end of April, 45 factories with more than 10,000 machines had completed construction and started operations. Among them, there was one factory specializing in reeling palace cocoons. Now, due to the exhaustion of raw dried cocoons, 15 factories have had to announce temporary shutdowns. The factories that are still running strongly will also shut down after the raw materials are reeled. It is expected that most of them will temporarily shut down before the end of this month and resume operations after the spring cocoons enter the market. Only one or two factories can connect with the spring cocoons.

Spring Cocoons in Various Places Begin to Enter the Market

The spring cocoons are listed earliest in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, and the latest in Wuxi and Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. The local cocoons in Zhejiang Province will be listed around the 17th of this month, and the improved species will be listed one week later. The improved species in Jiangsu Province will be listed in early June. Shanghai silk factories originally planned to buy cocoons from the producing areas, but now, (1) banks and money houses have stopped lending money for cocoons, (2) insurance companies do not allow the insurance of military fires and theft risks, and (3) the occupied areas are unstable. Non-occupied areas such as Xiaoshao, etc., because the shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is cut off, the collected cocoons cannot be transported to Shanghai, so each factory regards the collection of cocoons as a dangerous path.

Abandoning Control of Township Cocoon Shops

In addition to robbing silk factories in the occupied areas, Huazhong attempted to control the collection of cocoons and once handled the registration of cocoon shops. Now, because the cocoon shops in various places are located in the countryside and cities, there are no cocoon shops, and the townships are now controlled by guerrillas. According to the order, cocoon shops related to "Huazhong Company" will be destroyed. In Haining County, as many as 21 cocoon shops have been destroyed. Therefore, Huazhong Company has abandoned the control of cocoon shops in various townships except for the control of cocoon shops within the urban area, and allows manufacturers and surplus cocoon merchants to freely set up shops in various townships to collect cocoons.

Loans for Spring Cocoons in Eastern Zhejiang to Buy

Regarding Sheng County, Xinchang, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and other places in eastern Zhejiang, after the Zhejiang Province Government made efforts to increase the yield of spring cocoons, the breeding of spring silkworms this year has increased dramatically. Due to suitable weather in , it is expected that the harvest will be good. From the 17th, the spring cocoons will start to appear on the market. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has agreed with the Zhejiang Local Bank to lend money to buy as much as possible. In order to relieve the livelihood of farmers, the central price of spring cocoons is stipulated, and cocoon shops in various places buy according to this price. The collected cocoons are sold to the Trade Commission and exported to Hong Kong and other places.

In order to maintain traffic, the military authorities still allow ships to enter and leave various ports. Lisheng arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou, Hana returned to Shanghai from Dinghai, and Moufu sailed to Wenzhou on the 9th. The details are recorded as follows.

Lisheng Arrives in Shanghai, Moufu Rescheduled

After the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Command approved the resumption of shipping in Wenzhou, the British-owned Hesheng sailed from Fuzhou to Shanghai, passed Wenzhou, and loaded goods and passengers. It arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 p.m. yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Pier. The German-owned Moufu, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou today, has been postponed again and again. Although it is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou on the 9th, whether it will sail at that time depends on whether there are any difficulties in the voyage.

Hana Has Sailed from Dinghai to Shanghai

The German-owned Far East Company's Hana, which decided to resume shipping to Dinghai, was detained in the sea off Dinghai. Although it has been released safely and arrived in Dinghai, it is said that the detention incident has not been resolved. The ship has sailed from Dinghai to Shanghai at 4:00 p.m. yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. this morning. However, the company believes that the detention incident has been resolved. The German-owned Haifu, which was approved to sail on the Shanghai-Dinghai route, originally planned to sail from Shanghai to Dinghai the day before yesterday. Now, because Hana was detained, it was decided to suspend the sailing and changed the route to the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, which has not yet been decided. It is currently berthed at the Shanghai Roosevelt Pier.

Ningbo-Dinghai Shipping Temporarily Suspended

The shipping route between Dinghai and Ningbo was originally served by the German-owned Tianbao, the German-owned Lulin's Gaodeng, and the Portuguese-owned Zhengsui Company's Libao. Now, the above three ships have been detained by Japanese ships in the sea off Dinghai and forced to sail to Shanghai to berth. Therefore, the Ding-Yong route has had to be temporarily suspended. It is also said that when Gaodeng was detained, a tax official from a certain bureau in Ningbo was killed. As for the Shanghai-Ningbo route, except for oil tankers such as Asia, Mobil, and Texaco, passenger and cargo ships are all prohibited from sailing.

### Western Newspaper Expresses Views on the Inspection of Chinese Newspapers

Expressing Sympathy for the Difficulties Faced by the Authorities; Finding it Difficult to Accept Undue Restrictions

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury published an editorial yesterday titled "The Police and the Press," stating that the Commissioner-General of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a rather strong letter to Chinese newspapers in Shanghai, regardless of their nationality, using clear and unambiguous language, resembling the implementation of censorship on certain news materials. The letter stated that "any article relating to the current hostile actions, political movements, or political groups, or containing speeches or pronouncements inciting violence, regardless of its source, must be submitted to the Special Branch of the Central Police Station for approval before publication." The letter also contained a significant statement: "Your paper must currently understand the reasons for such precautions," and stated that "failure to obtain prior approval before publication in accordance with the above instructions will result in the revocation of your paper's registration certificate and other actions taken as directed by the Municipal Council."

Legal Perspective

From a purely legal perspective, it is extremely questionable whether the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department has the right to inspect such publications or, in fact, interfere with their publication and sale, except for Shanghai foreign publications engaging in blatant provocation that can be brought to court under the laws of their respective nationalities. Even in cases where charges are brought, there is no reason under American law to take actions that effectively prohibit them.

For the Sake of Readers

On the other hand, during this period, we should show the greatest sympathy for the difficulties faced by the foreign authorities in both districts. As long as these authorities restrain themselves with reason, we will not want to be nitpicky or overly assertive of legal rights. We believe that other newspapers share this sentiment. If the authorities were to interfere with the proper publication of news or the faithful expression of editorial opinions, we would have to seriously consider other methods to fight against undue restrictions or rather suspend our Chinese edition rather than deprive readers of the moral rights they expect to receive.

Unreasonable

Even this order, in our view, does not seem to be intended to unduly interfere with legitimate newspaper operations. What is opposed to publication is speeches or declarations, which clearly refers to the full text of speeches or declarations. We do not believe that it intends to interfere with summaries of important speeches issued by news agencies, whether from Chongqing or Tokyo, as such an attitude would not only be impractical but also unreasonable. In other words, we believe this order is intended to prevent the excessive selection of documents for political reasons, causing criticism.

Automatic Acquiescence

In the current situation, we are prepared to comply with this wish. We believe that any newspaper that is of an ordinary commercial nature and published without political motives will acquiesce in this attitude as a temporary emergency measure. However, this so-called automatic acquiescence should not be mistaken for submission to censorship. When the Chinese government governed the area around Shanghai, it made efforts to subject our publications to Chinese censorship. Although we always expressed our willingness to cooperate in a manner that we considered to be based on fairness and sound consciousness, we refused to be censored. As a result, there was a generally satisfactory arrangement.

Self-Examination

We take the same view and refuse to accept the Japanese attempts to censor us. At the same time, we also hope to be reasonable and fair ourselves and not be unaware of the changes that have taken place outside the concession area, which are different from the past. As mentioned earlier, we do not believe that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities intend to take further action beyond preventing the political manipulation of newspapers in this city. Since our newspaper is of a commercial nature, we wholeheartedly agree with the aforementioned overall goal. On the other hand, we are not at all interested in issuing a censored newspaper and would not be willing to do so.

Fortunately Uninjured; Escorted Across the Bridge by Store Employees; One Store Employee Summoned to the Police Station for Interrogation

While they were discussing prices, a Chinese youth, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and black pants, around 20 years old, suddenly came along with a sharp ax (with a hook on the ax head) and struck the Japanese woman's head. The Japanese woman fell to the ground injured, but there was no blood flowing from her head. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the youth threw the sharp ax at the entrance of the lane and fled south. The shop owner helped the Japanese woman up, and the Japanese woman asked the shop owner to send her and her two children to the north side of the Sichuan Road Bridge. Around 2:00 PM, the Central Police Station sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate, taking away a certain shop employee and a certain coppersmith who had his stall parked at the entrance of the lane. They also found the murder weapon, an ax, on the ground at the entrance of the lane. There was a Chinese letter tied to the handle. The meaning of the letter roughly referred to the ferocity of the Japanese in oppressing the Chinese, that the Chinese must take off their hats and bow when they meet the Japanese, and that the Chinese were extremely resentful, hence this incident. After 4:00 PM, the Hongkou Police Station also sent Chinese and English detectives and Japanese detectives to conduct a detailed investigation and took the shop owner away for questioning before releasing him and the coppersmith. However, the shop employee is still being detained for further investigation due to inconsistent statements.

Children's Weekly - Mother's Day Special Issue

On this Mother's Day, the publication sincerely wishes and pays the highest respects to the mothers of millions of healthy children in China. - Editor

### From Mother's Day to Maternal Education

- Yang Mou

Mother's Day has arrived again. In this autumn when iron hooves are trampling the land, most families are separated, and the displacement of mothers is naturally expected. Therefore, I want to talk about the issue of "maternal education" because once mothers and children are separated, children will inevitably lose maternal education, which is a very serious problem.

What is maternal education? In fact, maternal education is family education, which is the education given by mothers to their children before and after they enter school. Of course, maternal education has a greater influence on children than school education. We can say that the success or failure of a person's life depends on maternal education. It is remembered that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek also attributed his success to his mother's teachings on his fiftieth birthday. From this, we can know the greatness and importance of maternal education.

Education in schools teaches us how to live and behave in the world, and maternal education, although it is nothing more than this kind of thing, also has the most important thing, that is, "love." Mothers cannot escape "love" for their children everywhere, so this "love" will always be embedded in the child's heart, making them able to love people, understand people, and forgive people... And this "love" is really the greatest thing in the world.

The reason why I want to raise this issue now is that I hope that various charitable organizations will instill some "love" into the education of children who have lost their mothers, so that children can still be educated as if they were receiving maternal education, and there is more hope for success in the future.

### My Mom

- Mou Ling, Fifth Grader, Minsheng Elementary School

My mom is very young. She has a healthy body and a full spirit, without any sign of aging. Every time I go out with my mom, people always treat my mom as my older sister. How happy I am to have such a young and healthy mom.

Mom loves me very much, just like the moms of other children love their children. I also love my mom very much. I think: There is probably no child in the world who doesn't love their mom.

Mom treats people very kindly. Her face always has a kind smile. She is very polite to everyone, so she often says to me: "Child, you should be kind and humble in dealing with people, don't be arrogant, arrogance leads to failure."

When the weather gets cold, Mom still gets up very early every day. In addition to doing housework, she also knits woolen clothes for me, so I have so many woolen clothes, big and small, dark and light, with many different patterns. I wear them comfortably and beautifully. When people see my clothes, everyone praises my mom's high artistry and envies me.

Every day when I go home from school, Mom guides me in reading and writing. If there are unclear parts in the book, Mom will explain them to me in detail. Sometimes, seeing that I am tired, she will tell me an interesting story or a joke to make me laugh out loud, then I will forget my tiredness and happily do my homework again. Sometimes, Mom often takes me to see plays or go ice skating... Mom likes me so much, but if I do something bad, don't listen to Mom, or don't study hard, then Mom will scold me without hesitation.

My mom is a good mom. I have never left her. I want to spend sweet days in Mom's arms forever.

### My Mom

- Lin Jiewan, Third Grader, Laigna Elementary School

The person I love the most is my mom. My mom gets up very early every day. She likes to read Shen Bao, and she likes to use domestic products. She never uses any imported products for clothes, food, or utensils, and she also advises us and our neighbors to use domestic products. She is very kind and treats me and my older brother very well. Every Sunday, she accompanies us to play in the park. After resting at home for a while, she tells us to write and read. Sometimes she even tells us to do arithmetic. If we do well, she gives us a bag of candy or a box of building blocks as a reward. She works very diligently at home, wiping the windows very brightly and wiping the tables and chairs very clean, so she organizes the housework very well!

### My Mom

- Yang Yanggang, Fourth Grader, Yixin Elementary School

Mom is the greatest person in the world. Is there any person or animal in the world that is born without a mom?

On a cold winter night in 1925, I came out of my mother's womb with a cry and entered the world. From that day on, I have been nurtured and cultivated by my mom for many years. She sent me to school, and now I am a fourth grader.

One day two years ago, I was playing soccer with my friends. One of my friends accidentally kicked my foot, so I made a face and kicked back. Unexpectedly, Mom found out and called me into the room, scolded me, and hit my palm more than a dozen times. I cried.

After receiving this strict punishment, I knew that friends should be kind to each other and should not quarrel. So from that day on, I have never quarreled with anyone.

One hot summer, I didn't listen to my mom and ate too much ice cream and watermelon. I became seriously ill and lay on the bed groaning and tossing. She was very sad and anxious, sitting by my side without leaving, busy preparing medicine for me. She only hoped that I would get better soon. After her many days of dedicated care, my illness gradually healed.

From that day on, I knew that what Mom said was right, so from that day on, I listened to everything Mom said and never disobeyed her.

Because Mom saw that I could reform, she often took me to the park, watched movies, and often told me stories, and told me not to do bad things. I felt very happy.

The above two facts are what I personally experienced. I am very grateful to my mom. I hope that all the moms in the world can love their sons like this, and I hope that all the children in the world can respect their moms.

### My Mom

- Shi Tianrong, Sixth Grader, Hualong Elementary School

No matter whose mom it is in the world, they all love their own children. So my mom must love me, of course. I feel that Mom's love for me is greater than anyone else's. Even Dad doesn't love me like this, because I am closest to Mom. However, when I make mistakes, Mom is also the strictest in punishing me. I remember once, I took a few coins from the table without telling Mom. Later, Mom found out and insisted that I tell her what I bought. I didn't say, so she hit my palm like a teacher in school. Later, I said that I bought candy, so Mom stopped hitting me. She slowly said to me, the following paragraph: "Tianrong! It's not that I don't want to give you money to buy things to eat, because I have seen with my own eyes that there are always many stalls around the entrance of every school, what little book stalls, candy stalls that can ruin your teeth, and red and green colored sugar water, etc. These things are harmful to elementary school students. In addition, there are gambling stalls, etc., which are the most hateful. It doesn't matter if they cheat you out of money, but if you develop the bad habit of gambling, you will definitely not be a good person when you grow up. So I hit you, not because I hate you, nor because I don't like you, but because I want you to become a good person. If you are hungry and want to eat snacks, Mom will buy you good things to eat. Don't go to the stalls to buy those unclean things. There are many problems outside now, and eating unclean things will make you sick. Also, when you take anything, you should tell Mom first, don't secretly take it and run away. At your young age, your own consciousness is not enough, so you must discuss things with your parents in advance. Your parents will never deceive you..." The above is what Mom said to me. I thought it was right, so I wrote down this paragraph for everyone to see.

### My Mom

- Shen Yanyuan, Fifth Grader, Guanghua Elementary School

I think every child has his mother, but when I was seven years old, my mother abandoned my younger brother and me and left people forever. Mom loved me very much. I remember one winter when I was very sick. The weather was cold. She sat by my bed pouring tea for me. She didn't sleep all night. After a few days, she got sick herself, but she still never forgot me. Mother's illness became more and more serious every day. Later, I got better, and she said to my father, "Yuan'er, you must take good care of her, give her to read, and Qing'er, you take them to their grandmother's house! My illness will not get better." At that time, I didn't quite understand what my mother said. I was happy when I heard that I was going to my grandmother's house, so I went with my father. I didn't get news from my mother for a few days. One day, my father suddenly said very urgently, "Your mother is about to die, what should I do?" My father told me and my brother to go to the hospital to see my mother for the last time, but my grandmother said, "Don't take the children, Yuan'er has just recovered from her illness." Then my grandfather also came back, and when he heard what my father said, he was about to cry. So my grandparents and father all took rickshaws to my mother's hospital. I remember they didn't come back that night. The next morning, my grandmother came back and cried so much that she didn't look like herself. She looked at me and said, "Yuan'er, from now on you will be an orphan without a mother." When I heard this sentence, although I didn't quite understand it, I saw my grandmother crying so badly, and I started crying too. After that, I lost my dear mother. Then my dear father also died. It's been four years now. I have spent these four years in pain. Although my grandparents both love me, I can't forget my mother. Now my health is not good and I am often sick, but my mom will never come to comfort me again.

### My Mother

— Tang Guizhen, 4th Grade, Minsheng Elementary School

I remember one winter evening, the gray sky filled with fluttering white snow. The earth was enveloped in a vast expanse of white. The weather was so bitterly cold, the northwest wind howling fiercely. At that time, I was lying in my warm bed, constantly clamoring, "I want cake! I want cake!" Seeing this, my mother put on her overshoes, held up an umbrella, and braved the wind and snow to buy it for me. At that time, I only knew to eat the cake, my goal achieved, and that was it. I didn't think about my mother's heart! When Mom saw me sick, her loving face wore a worried expression. She served me with all her heart and comforted me. After I recovered, I felt bored, wanting this and wanting that, and she always gently and kindly complied with me, never showing any sign of annoyance. This was still five years ago.

At that time, Mom was healthy and energetic. I didn't expect that in these short five years, Mom's face has aged so much, and faint wrinkles have appeared on her forehead. Of course, Mom is worried about her children. She has never had a peaceful day. She gets up early and goes to bed late, taking care of the household chores. Because Dad passed away a long time ago, we rely entirely on Mom to manage everything. So Mom often says to me, "Good child! I work so hard to provide you with food and clothing, and to pay for your school fees, hoping that you will study hard and become a useful person in the future, so that I won't have suffered in vain, and it will comfort your father under the nine springs (in the afterlife)." I keep my mother's words in my heart forever, as my motto.

The most respectable, the most great, and the most loving person in the world is Mother. Children! Let's not forget our mothers!

### My Mother

— Xu Zhipeng, 3rd Grade, Humin Elementary School

My mother treats me very well. When I come home from school every day, she has already prepared snacks for me to eat. When it's cold, she tells me to put on more clothes, and when it's hot, she tells me to take off some clothes. At the same time, Mom also puts in a lot of effort to prepare all my living expenses. Every Sunday, Mom also takes me to the park to play and get some fresh air. Receiving such love and good guidance from my mother, I feel deeply in my conscience that I must study hard in order to repay my mother in the future.

### My Mother

— Wang Qian, 6th Grade, Minsheng Elementary School

My loving mother, whom I cannot bear to be separated from, nurtures me and shapes me with all her heart and effort. Her kind and gentle demeanor is always deeply imprinted in my mind. She is truly a virtuous and reasonable mother. She loves me very much. I recall last month when I was writing, I suddenly felt dizzy and uncontrollably fell down. In a moment, I opened my eyes and saw myself lying in bed, with my mother constantly comforting me by my side. Seeing her saintly, gentle, and kind appearance, my suffering immediately eased. But when I make mistakes and am punished, her stern words and severe expression are quite solemn and awe-inspiring. But even though Mom puts on an angry face, the kindness between her brows is always faintly visible. Dear mother, your kind and strict teachings make me both afraid and love you. Mother, how great is your spirit! How loving is your heart! The most loving and sacred in the world is only the mother. We have received endless kindness, and we should find ways to repay it. Therefore, I always remember the famous saying of the ancient sages: "Great filial piety is the foundation of teaching the country and protecting the clan."

### My Mother

— Jia Shoutong, 5th Grade, Qiaoguang Elementary School

"The idea that no one in the world is as great as my mother will always remain in my mind. It's not just me who thinks this way, probably all the children in the world have this idea!

My mother treats me with great love. When I am sick, she sits by my bed all day taking care of me, even forgetting to eat and sleep. When it gets cold, she hurries to make winter clothes for me, and when it gets hot, she makes summer clothes for me. As I grow day by day, the wrinkles on my mother's forehead also increase one by one. She works tirelessly for me all day long. When will I ever be able to repay my mother's kindness?

Not only does my mother love me in this way, but she is also a patriotic person. She never buys inferior goods, and all her daily necessities are bought at national goods stores. She also advises her neighbors not to buy inferior goods, and she also tells me to save my daily candy money and donate it to the country. How great is my mother's spirit!

### My Mother

— Zhang Zhonghe, 6th Grade, Currently Out of School

What I miss the most is my mother, and no love is deeper than a mother's love for her son. Especially me, when I was nine years old, I lost my dearest father. There was only me and my mother in the family, so she was so sad. She often taught me with a compassionate tone: "You must study hard. You must know that children without fathers are definitely the most... sad... How will we... go on from here?" She broke this gloomy atmosphere, weeping with tears, making me, with my stubborn temper, also feel ashamed. I am really sorry for Mom, and finally I lay on my mother's lap and cried, "Mother, please forgive me!" I am now reflecting on myself. Without a father, I can only rely on studying hard, so that my father's soul can also be happy. Mother, "I will study hard from now on, don't be sad!"

Ah! Mom, I now understand what you said to me before. You are truly a benefactor to me. You are such a great nurturer. How will I repay her in the future... and how will I comfort her?

### My Mother

— Pan Zhimin, 4th Grade, Xinsheng Elementary School

When I was very young, my mother swaddled me. When I cried, my mother would feed me milk. At that time, I didn't know anything and had no memory. When I was two or three years old, I gradually began to understand. She raised me until I was four years old, and then Mom sent me to kindergarten to study. I remember that I suddenly got sick at that time. Mom was very worried and went to invite a very famous doctor to treat me. After taking a few doses of medicine, fortunately, I recovered, but I still didn't want to eat. So Mom went to buy beef juice, chicken juice, ham, and other things for me to eat. After a week, I gradually returned to normal. Only then was my mother relieved. But because of this, my mother's face became much thinner, and she often hoped that I would be healthy. I think the most loving person in the world is my own mother. When I grow up, I will definitely repay my mother!

### My Mother

— Zhang Qingxia, 6th Grade, Wenzong Elementary School

My mother is only in her thirties, but people think she looks like she's in her forties. Why does she look so old? Because she works very hard! There are seven of us siblings in total. Cooking three meals a day and managing the household are all shouldered by my mother alone. When she sees that the weather is cold, she gives us clothes to wear and makes a pair of cotton shoes for each of us. Seeing that my three younger brothers who go to school are cold, Mom is busy knitting woolen sweaters for them. When she has free time, she also teaches my two younger brothers and sisters to read. And because my father's finances are difficult, Mom puts in even more effort, altering my eldest brother's old clothes for my younger brother to wear. Sometimes when we are fast asleep and our quilts are not properly tucked in, Mom sees it and comes to cover us. Only Mom cares about whether we are warm or cold. She has put in a lot of effort to raise us, how can we repay her? We can only study hard and strive for future independence to repay my mother's boundless grace!

They want to persuade Donny's mother to send Donny to the front lines to help in the war. Donny's mother, because Donny's four older brothers have all died in battle, is reluctant to order Donny to join the army again. She argues with all her might with the spirits of the deceased. But after Donny knocks on the door and wakes up, hearing the radio report that the enemy killed the children in the school, out of pity and pain for other people's children, she immediately sacrifices her personal love and orders Donny to go and kill the enemy. This kind of great motherly love truly deserves to be called the prototype of motherly love.

(The mother on stage is talking to her dead loved ones. Now, the only one left living in the world is her youngest son, Donny.)

Mother: Don't you love Donny? Not even a little bit?

Father: Of course we love him, dear, we really love him very much. But we know, poor little lamb, because of being forced to stay

Mother: Let him suffer! If he stays with Mom, that's a big sacrifice, then he won't be able to be filial to me!

Andrew: He is very filial to you, Mom. We are all filial to you, you know that.

Mother: Don't say that, Andrew. You don't know what love is; you all had other purposes in the world, much bigger than love. I don't have any other purposes, Richard; I can't think of anything bigger in my heart. Donny, this little treasure, I often hold his hand, ... Dear God! Are you all crazy! How can I let such a child leave me, only God knows!"

Tomorrow is Mother's Day, let's all salute Mom!

### Grain - Dumi Uniformly 15 Yuan, Ke Xian Also Reaches 14 Yuan Price Limit - Difficult to Achieve Long-Term Stability

Since yesterday's meeting of seven rice and grain groups in the National Rice Market, due to the continuous soaring rice prices, which cannot be allowed to continue, it was decided to widen the price limit by one yuan. High-quality white粳 is limited to 15 yuan and must not exceed this price. Yesterday, 11 ships of goods from Fengjing and Nangang arrived in the city, and over 2,000 packages of Che Lun Bao Zi (wheel-packaged rice) arrived from the Su Tong area. Recently, from Wuxi, it was originally calculated at 125 packages per vehicle, and a total of 625 packages arrived at the port. However, because a certain foreign firm wanted to collect a large amount of rice in the Wuxi area, the local area did not have this large quantity available, and all the firms did not accept it. The foreign firm became angry and asked a certain party to intervene, claiming that they were intentionally making things difficult. They also made excuses about the situation, which led to the source of Wuxi rice being cut off again. As for the city-wide sales market, hoarding households have all stopped, and only the shops on this street are slightly replenishing their stocks. However, regardless of whether the rice is thick or thin, 粳, Dumi, or Ke Xian, all have reached the price limit, which is bound to be broken. The Fengjing rice is of the worst quality, but it is also priced at 14.5 yuan, which is the same as the Bao Zi goods. Because the bag skin also needs to be added, it must also be 15 yuan.

Based on the calculation of 600,000 packages of rice in Shanghai's inventory, widening the price limit by one yuan will result in a profit of at least 800,000 yuan. However, because the cost of rice varies, from low to high, the estimated profit is closer to 1.56 million yuan. In particular, the silver money industry and wealthy hoarding households will gain the most, while rice dealers who buy and sell quickly will gain less. Those with strong capital will gain abundant profits. According to the current situation, if there are no corrective measures, the rice price will be raised by three parties, causing a continuous cycle. As the weather gradually gets hotter, the rice will inevitably be damaged after being steamed by thunder. In addition to warehouse rent, interest on dismantling, etc., those who have rice will again have an excuse to raise the rice price again, which is also difficult to predict. Those who are responsible for regulating the people's food should pay attention in advance. If purchasing foreign rice is used as a tool for remedy, it is not necessary to say that one abandons what one has and does not use it, and it is also not a good idea to spend a large amount of foreign exchange.

Bian Yuan can still be sold, but high-quality goods still sell for 12.5 yuan, and medium-quality rice for 19 yuan.

Ke Xian was only actively traded on this street yesterday, and the total transaction volume was less than 3,000 packages. As for the selling price, the market has widened the limit by half a yuan. The maximum is 14 yuan, and severe penalties will be imposed for exceeding the limit. Therefore, Nanjing Gao Xian are all priced at the highest price of 14 yuan, while Wu Xian are priced one or two jiao lower. The market seems to be temporarily stable. However, Nanjing local is prohibited from exporting, and Te Gao Jing local is prohibited from exporting. Te Gao Jing Xian is still unwilling to sell cheaply with the market. Since foreign rice rose to 18.5 yuan, importers are not very greedy to handle it, and the market has also turned to a stable trend.

### Quiet Flour Market

Factory Flour: Since the wind of price increase subsided the day before yesterday, it continued to stabilize yesterday. There is no strong demand from local and out-of-town buyers, and the factory does not supply large quantities, so the overall market can be described as having low supply and demand. According to news from the buyers' side, the price of flour in Tianjin can be sold for more than 5 yuan in Shanghai currency. Transporters are still greedy, but the factory price is too high, so they plan to abandon small profits and take larger ones. Yesterday, the wholesale price of No. 2 flour on this street continued to be 4.5 yuan, and buyers' prices still increased by 2.5 to 5 fen. The total transaction volume was only about 30,000 packages. The market is still brewing.

Foreign Flour: Transactions are as calm as before. It is found that most of the imported American flour from "Tai Li Ti Bie Si" mail ships is reluctant to be released. Except for direct distribution, the amount of goods circulating in the market is not large, so people's hearts are still strong. It is heard that a certain buyer group inquired yesterday, and the selling price of brands such as "Sampan" and "Double Eagle" was 4.55 yuan in cash, including fees, which is roughly equal to the price of local factory flour. The transaction volume was approximately 7,000 packages. The market is also brewing.

Exports: 12,000 packages of flour were shipped to Tianjin on the 7th, and 7,500 packages of flour and 1,000 packages of wheat bran were shipped to Shantou.

### Finance - Xiamen Group Vigorously Buys at Low Prices - Cash Prices Stop Falling and Turn Upward

The black market conditions for the exchange of cash today have slightly changed, resulting in a slight increase in price, which has returned to the level of 2,110 yuan outside the customs. However, the situation was weak at first and then firm. At the opening, due to the strong selling intention of the money exchange industry, and the cash shops also followed suit and sold off, the opening price was lowered to 2,105 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop (on behalf of the Xiamen group) took advantage of the low price to vigorously absorb the goods. In addition, a certain money exchange industry sold its strength at the same price. Although a certain gold shop came out on behalf of customers' long positions at that time, the supply and demand were still disparate, and the market situation suddenly improved. In the end, the price rose by 4 yuan, and the transaction was still strong in the morning, with approximately 600 taels traded. In the afternoon, it was heard that the buying side once shouted the price up to 2,129 yuan, but there was no transaction. Gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged. Customs gold and British pure gold were flat. Chinese pure gold and standard gold rose slightly.

The Black Market Price for Sycee Rises by 4 Yuan

From the morning, the initial opening price for each bar (10 taels) was slightly weaker due to the strong selling intention of the money exchange industry. The money exchange industry first forcefully sold 100 taels to the gold shop at an opening price of 2,105 yuan, which was 4 yuan lower than the previous transaction. After the opening, the cash shop also sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 06 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange industry also sold a total of 100 taels to the same industry at the same price. Before long, a certain money exchange industry suddenly turned to aggressive buying, and a certain gold shop (on behalf of the Xiamen buyer group) continued to absorb goods. Although a certain gold shop cut off speculative long positions on behalf of speculators at that time, the positions were still not enough to distribute, so the market price gradually increased. A certain money exchange industry then entered a certain gold shop for 100 taels at a price of 07 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold shop also entered a certain gold shop for 50 taels at the same price. Later, a certain gold shop again entered the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 08 yuan, and a certain money exchange industry entered the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 09 yuan. After that, the buying intention of a certain money exchange industry became stronger, and the sellers repeatedly raised the price, so it broke out of the 10 yuan mark. A certain money exchange industry entered the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 10 yuan, and then entered the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 13 yuan. After that, although the price was shouted up to 15 yuan, the sellers still had no intention of supplying goods, so there was no transaction. Therefore, the closing price at noon was 13 yuan. In the afternoon, a certain money exchange industry still wanted to absorb goods at the beginning, and the price was shouted from 15 yuan to 20 yuan, but the sellers still had no intention of supplying goods. After 3:30, the long side suddenly had selling intentions, but a certain money exchange industry had already adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and there were no transactions for half a day. If the closing price at noon was 2,113 yuan, the result was a gain of 4 yuan compared to the closing price at noon on the previous day. The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 2,125 yuan, and the receiving price was 110 yuan previously. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are no transactions.

The Price of Gold Jewelry Remains Unchanged

The exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops remains unchanged. Datong Bank is 214 yuan, Xintong Bank is 212 yuan, and the receiving price is 206 yuan.

Chinese Pure Gold Follows the Big Four Corners

According to a London telegram on the 5th, the price of British pure gold per ounce remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence. However, the Central Bank's buying and selling of Chinese cash was larger (the bank's holiday was May 4th) by the Big Four Corners, totaling 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also increased by 4 jiao compared to the pre-holiday price, totaling 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Slightly Looser - British and American Exchange Rates Unchanged

The foreign exchange market was still busy with settlements by major foreign firms yesterday. In addition, Ying Hang You Li (representing the Tianjin group) and the Japanese banking community also started to compete for the settlement of spot sterling. However, the supply intention of various foreign banks such as British and American banks was still strong, so the market situation remained stable throughout, and the results were flat. Transactions were still strong in the first half of the day. The Hong Kong exchange rate tended to loosen slightly due to the stronger selling intention of foreign banks.

At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was still flat in the near and far terms. The New York silver price was stagnant, and the London raw gold also showed no rise or fall. The exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The exchange rates for American, British, Shanghai, and French currencies were also unchanged. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling price of spot exchange rates by banks in the morning was 8 pence and 25 for British currency and 16 yuan and 0.0625 for American currency, which was unchanged compared to the previous closing price. After the opening, although major foreign firms successively settled British and American currencies, the supply intention of various foreign banks such as British and American banks was still strong, so there was no change. It is calculated that the foreign firms settled HSBC's spot British currency at 8 pence and 25, and also settled a certain bank's spot American exchange rate at 16 yuan and 0.0625. When HSBC's listed price was announced, it did not move. And when the silver balance tax was announced, it also did not rise or fall, calculating that it was still charged at 6.25%. After that, although Ying Hang You Li (representing the Tianjin group) and the Japanese banking community also competed to settle British currency, foreign banks such as HSBC still had strong supply intentions, and the market situation did not change. It is calculated that HSBC, Hua Bi, and McGary mutually settled Ying Hang You Li and the Japanese banking community with spot British currency at 8 pence and 25. Subsequently, transactions gradually cleared. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, the foreign bank forcefully sold the spot price to the money exchange industry at 55 yuan and 75, which was slightly firmer. The closing selling price of spot exchange rates by banks at noon was 8 pence and 25 for British currency and 16 yuan and 0.0625 for American currency, which was no different from the opening price in the morning. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55 yuan and 75. The result was that the British and American exchange rates were unchanged compared to the evening closing price on the previous day, while the Hong Kong exchange rate was reduced by 125. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

### Strong Demand for French and Vietnamese Notes - Sufficient to Show that Many People are Going to the Southwest

Yesterday, British pure gold and British and American exchange rates did not change. Foreign exchange firms in this port were still busy with settlements. The demand from Japanese banks was also strong. Fortunately, the supply from various banks was smooth, and the market price did not change. Forward foreign exchange tended to stabilize, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also loosened. The black market for sycee opened vigorously. Transactions were not strong. After entering the market, the Tianjin group's buying intention was active, and the price increase was quite strong. The supply from gold shops and silver shops was not smooth, and the closing price at noon was very firm. In the afternoon, people's hearts were uncertain, and there were no transactions. Transactions of foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds were very active. Although the supply from wealthy people was strong, new absorbers were also not lonely. The supply of British and American gold notes was also smooth. The price decreased due to the stabilization of foreign exchange and the loosening of forward rates. The Hong Kong currency decreased slightly due to the lack of strong demand and the firmness of bills of exchange. The demand for German gold notes was very rare, and the price became more depressed. However, French franc notes and Annam notes, which were essential for traveling to the southwest, continued to rise in price. There were few transactions in the guild. Only Ying Feng exited and Fu He Xiang entered 2,200 French franc notes. Yesterday's market price: British gold notes decreased by 1 fen, American gold notes decreased by 3 li, Hong Kong notes decreased by 2 li, French franc notes increased by 5 hao, Singapore notes decreased by 1 fen, Annam notes increased by 4 fen, German gold notes decreased by 5 fen. Other currencies did not change.

### Call Loan Rate Opens at 9 Fen

Yesterday, the rediscount rate for exchange drawing tickets showed a slight increase. The rate per 1,000 yuan once reached as high as 50 yuan and 7.5 jiao, but in the end, the price returned to 50 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day. The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association has broken through the 1 jiao mark, continuing to fall by 1 fen, totaling 9 fen. The gradual decline in silver liquidity is a clear indication of the stability of Chinese finance.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Cannot Muster Enthusiasm, Foreign Debt Still Shows Improvement

Yesterday's securities market, after a one-day holiday, continued to fluctuate. However, due to repeated efforts by the bulls to push up prices, it showed a slight increase. Given the unfavorable environment, major bull players were struggling to induce short covering, aiming to fulfill their desire to exit. Throughout the day, the opening saw buyers like No. 14, No. 35, Runli, Yongkang, and retail investors covering shorts. Sellers included No. 10, No. 18, Qiafeng, and Kanghao, resulting in a balanced struggle. However, as sellers lowered prices and buyers raised prices, a slight increase was achieved. The afternoon continued in the same vein, with bulls striving to maintain market prices, preventing them from falling and achieving a further slight gain of five fen or one jiao. As a result, market prices improved slightly by one jiao five fen to three jiao five fen, except for 96, which dropped by five fen alone. The total transaction volume was estimated at around 560,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below. Starting next week, the morning trading session will be changed to begin at 9:45 AM.

### Deliberation on Handling Methods for War-Related Losses

— (Continued) Lu Shanzhi

(III) For any enterprise, if the final annual accounts show a surplus, shareholders can typically demand dividend distribution, after covering losses and setting aside statutory reserves. Enterprises that have suffered war-related damages, if such losses are listed as accumulated losses, then even if there is a surplus, shareholders cannot demand dividend distribution according to law until the losses are fully covered. However, if such losses are listed as deferred assets, then enterprises that should have had losses can still show a surplus, and those that should have had less surplus can show more. As a result, shareholders can demand a larger dividend distribution. (Because once it is recognized that losses can be treated as assets, there can be no restriction on shareholders' demands for dividend distribution.) However, this surplus is actually fictitious. If it is allowed to be distributed, it will inevitably lead to a situation of using capital as interest, which is forbidden even in normal times, let alone after the war when the foundation of the enterprise is already fragile. Therefore, the result of treating war-related losses as deferred assets is tantamount to using accounting techniques to openly violate the legal provision of "no dividends can be distributed without a surplus." This is the third point that needs to be considered from a legal perspective.

(IV) Some may think that listing war-related losses as deferred assets can be amortized over several years, reducing profits and expenses, thereby making the income tax burden more favorable. However, this is not always the case. The calculation of income tax requires determining the ratio based on the amount of net profit and the actual amount of capital, which is then used as the standard for applying the tax rate. But tax rates vary, and the amount of net profit also varies. At the same time, the extent of war-related losses varies from industry to industry, and the operating results in the years after the war also vary. For some enterprises, under certain circumstances, treating war-related losses as deferred assets may be beneficial in terms of taxation. But who can guarantee that there will not be some enterprises where treating war-related losses as deferred assets will be unfavorable in terms of taxation? Therefore, from the perspective of the tax burden, treating war-related losses as deferred assets has both advantages and disadvantages for the government and industry and commerce, and no definitive conclusion can be drawn. This is the fourth point that needs to be considered from the perspective of the tax burden.

(V) For enterprises that have suffered war-related losses, if they have accumulated public reserves and provisions, these can be used to offset the losses in the first year as compensation. However, if the remaining amount is listed as an asset, then apart from amortizing a portion of it during each annual settlement, it will be impossible to quickly compensate for it in the future, even if a large surplus can be generated. At the same time, in the years with subsequent surpluses, should the public reserves still be allocated? Whether this allocated public reserve can continue to be used to offset war-related losses will also become a problem. As for the amortization standard for war-related losses as deferred assets, although the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approval states that it should not exceed one-tenth each year, the original amount of deferred assets will inevitably change if war-related losses need to be determined gradually in the following years, making calculations difficult. This is the fifth point that needs to be considered from an accounting practice perspective.

The above is only a brief overview of the major aspects considered. In reality, the occurrence of problems may become more complex due to the strengths and weaknesses of the past financial foundations of various industries, the differences in property structures, the size of the losses suffered, and the goodness and badness of future trends. From this, it can be seen that war-related losses, whether from the perspective of accounting theory, financial policy, legal viewpoints, tax burden, accounting practice, or post-war recovery, do not seem suitable to be treated as deferred assets and amortized gradually over ten years or more. In the author's opinion, the losses suffered by industry and commerce as a result of this war are indeed significant. However, since the losses have been suffered, they are irrecoverable, and the recovery in the future should be pursued urgently. Therefore, for the sake of industrial and commercial enterprises, it is better to endure the pain temporarily and seek steady progress, rather than clinging to the remnants and struggling to survive. If it is believed that some enterprises have suffered excessive losses and will be difficult to recover without appropriate leniency, it is believed that one should also consider from a stable and effective perspective, rather than concealing losses or artificially inflating assets, which would only lead to future troubles. Below, I will offer some suggestions for handling the issue of war-related losses, but I am not confident whether they are feasible and hope that accounting and business professionals will provide guidance. (To be continued)

### Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Are Sluggish, Yarn Market Relies on Stockpilers, Warehouse Receipts Remain Tight

The yarn market is calm, without major highlights. Because prices are high, actual demand has turned sluggish, and the market is fluctuating. However, most in the industry are not bearish on yarn prices. Therefore, while actual transactions are light, inter-trade buying and selling is very active, generally supported and stabilized by stockpilers. One merchant sold a large amount of Double Horse warehouse receipts, while another absorbed them all. The market is balanced in terms of incoming and outgoing chips, and market prices have not changed much. In the afternoon, the market initially strengthened and then weakened. The final price of 20-count Double Horse yarn from outside warehouses was $423, down $2.50 from the previous day.

The initial opening of the spot yarn market followed the previous day's purchase by a certain firm, which led to a price increase in an instant. This day still had lingering effects, with opening prices up by one yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipts was $420. However, the market sentiment was sluggish for spot transactions with the help of brokers, and transactions were also sparse. Inter-trade transactions were 30 bales, with opening prices only at $423, which was actually $2.50 lower than the previous day, indicating that the price of warehouse receipts was firm. This is because spot goods must be sold on the same day and require actual transactions, while warehouse receipts can be held for a long time. This is the reason for the recent tightness of warehouse receipts. After a short while, the market appeared relaxed and showed a tendency to decline, with dispersed sentiment and a drop of one or two yuan. The market then slightly recovered as traders purchased nearly 100 bales of warehouse receipts. At the close, the price of 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipts was $418 to $417.50, and the spot yarn price was $425. The afternoon opening saw fewer transactions due to Saturday, with the warehouse receipt price initially at $417.50 and spot yarn at $424, down one yuan. By the time of closing, it had weakened another yuan. A total of 609 bales were purchased by various syndicates. The market for Double Horse yarn fell by $2.50, Shepherd yarn fell by $4, and other brands also fell by one to three yuan. The opening price of 20-count Heavenly Maiden yarn from the Shenxin factory on the previous day was $410. It was the Xinsheng factory that opened with Golden Tiger brand yarn, which is corrected here. Also, today 680 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 85 bales to Hong Kong, 250 bales to Haiphong, and 470 bales to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each syndicate is listed as follows: Inter-trade: 1,345 inland, 239 Hong Kong, 250 Statistics: 1,609

The daily yarn market, which had been experiencing large ups and downs, has returned to normal. The market is increasingly calm, with limited fluctuations. The morning price of 20-count Yueqin yarn was $373, rising to $375. The afternoon opening remained stable, with a slight weakening trend.

### Spot Goods Decrease Daily, American Cotton Rises, Low-Quality Cotton Being Sold Cheaply

The market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market initially fell due to a drop in Liverpool prices and profit-taking by some bulls. Opposition to export subsidies is growing, but the supply of spot goods in the market is decreasing daily. As a result, there were a few transactions, and cotton prices rose. Later, spot merchants made some purchases, resulting in cotton prices rising by seven or eight pounds compared to the previous day. Washington has not yet announced anything regarding the cotton industry bill, but there will be a major change in the cotton market within the day. Yesterday, Indian cotton was predicted to rise by four rupees, Egyptian cotton was flat, and exchange rates showed little change. Converted to legal currency, the price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by five jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by one yuan, and Egyptian cotton remained unchanged.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quiet due to the high prices of overseas cotton in recent days and the tightness of forward exchange rates, making conversion to legal currency uneconomical. Starting yesterday, transactions at various factories have become quiet again. If foreign cotton prices can fall slightly, it may still attract large transactions. The factory delivery prices of yesterday's cotton market are recorded below:

Raw Material　Category　Delivery Price Including Tax

60-count Egyptian Cotton, Premium　105.10

Same as above, Medium　102.15

80-count, Premium　215.45

Same as above, Medium　115.10

20-count American Middling　88.95

Same as above, Low　75.75

32-count, 97.75

Same as above, Low　88.80

42-count, 99.60

Same as above, Low　87.55

South American Brazilian Cotton, Premium　87.15

Same as above, Medium　84.95

Same as above, Low　81.60

10-count Indian Pingle　65.55

10-count Indian Oomra　71.90

20-count Indian Broach　77.45

24-count Indian Compta　83.50

32-count American Simter　86.90

32/42-count American Pungappa　91.65

There is still no major development in local cotton business. Factory demand is also sluggish, and traders are also at a loss. As a result, market prices have not changed much from the previous day. Recently, Indian cotton prices have been rising, and factories may have hopes for developing eastern cotton. Therefore, the prices of high-quality cotton have not loosened. Low-quality cotton, which is less valuable, is being sold at lower prices. In addition, with the plum rain season approaching, it cannot be stored for long. Therefore, it is best to sell it quickly at a low price. 376 bales of cotton from Subei have arrived in Tongzhou. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded on the left:

Low-Quality Cotton　74.00　Xinyu Factory entry　200 bales　Factory delivery via bank transfer

Cotton Type Low-Quality Cotton　74.00　Xiehe Company entry　74 bales　Warehouse delivery in cash

Low-Quality Cotton　68.50　Trader's entry　150 bales　Warehouse delivery in cash

Pingle Cotton　63.50　Anda Factory entry　200 bales　Factory delivery in cash

Tongzhou Cotton　76.20　Trader's entry　150 bales　Warehouse delivery via bank transfer

### Piece Goods: Strong Demand for Bleaching, Dyeing, and Finishing of Piece Goods

East Piece Goods Remain Promising

Cloth Market

Actual sales remain sluggish. However, most warehouse stockpilers are still bullish. The downward trend in cotton yarn has temporarily stopped, and the market pressure is not heavy. The sales plates of various cloth merchants have gradually stabilized after several days of scattered selling. Sales of white goods are sluggish. A wholesale store on the street added 30 to 40 pieces of coarse cloth, a dyeing factory added over 50 pieces of fine twill and fine cloth. Brokers from Subei and inland areas added 30 pieces of fine and coarse cloth. Stockpilers purchased 100+ pieces of cheap secondhand fine twill, fine cloth and coarse cloth. The demand for bleaching, dyeing and finishing piece goods is abundant from both local wholesale stores and inland brokers. Western-style suits and sportswear requiring yellow-green khaki, lotus root-colored, bleached canvas and white drill, broadcloth, serge, etc. are driving purchases from the garment industry, making the market particularly strong. Demand from the southwest Sichuan and Yunnan provinces are both sluggish. A Chengdu broker sought over 1,000 bolts of autumn and winter style flannel and broadcloth, a Guangdong broker sought over 2,000 bolts of colored cloth and over 800 bolts of bleached cloth, a guerrilla area in Jiangsu and Zhejiang sought over 20 pieces of white coarse cloth, and 3,000+ bolts of matched white cloth, including poplin, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, floral plain linen, colored cloth and satin. A Bengbu broker sought over 50 cases of blue cloth and colored twill.

East Piece Goods

Yesterday, sales of white fine cloth and fine twill were strong due to active dyeing and finishing purchases on the street. Traders also bought at low prices, with transactions reaching 1,400 pieces. The fine cloth market turned firm, with 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rising from $14.00 per bolt to $14.50 per bolt, a one-jiao increase. Fine twill still showed no signs of improvement, and lower-quality goods showed a softening trend, opening at $12.90. Foreign firms did not open for business. According to traders, the market outlook is still promising.

### Oilcake: Sharp Rise and Rapid Fall in the Oil Market

The sharp rise in the oil market in mid-April to the end of the month was unprecedented in the last sixty years. Dalian soybean oil reached a staggering record high of $49, and Jiaozhou raw oil reached $45 (both occurred on April 24). Although this was attributed to the special wartime environment, there were clear signs of monopoly and manipulation. After the resolution of futures conversions, the incoming goods continued to arrive in an endless stream, so the market sentiment has plummeted in the last two days, and prices have declined sharply. Yesterday, 1,500 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil were opened for trading at $32, a sharp drop of $5 from the previous market. 130 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at $43.30 to $43.00, down another $1.50 from the previous market.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Dalian Soybeans Approach the Nine-Yuan Mark

Yesterday, Dalian soybeans continued to weaken due to the Tianjin syndicate's dumping of 60 carloads of goods, which were immediately divided and shipped to Shanghai by four ships, including Haiping and Xiangtai. The market price fell to the nine-yuan mark, opening at $8.95 to $8.88. Subsequently, one or two trading firms acted as scalpers and stabilized the market, and prices slightly rebounded, eventually closing at $8.92, with a total of six or seven carloads traded. Sales of sand yellow beans and Doudou beans turned dull, and market prices slightly recovered. 300+ bags of Tianjin beans were traded at prices ranging from $8.92 to $8.88, 20 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded at $8.92, and 50 bags of Pudong Doudou beans were traded at $9.80, with medium-sized ones at $9.30, and 100+ bags of Pinghu Doudou beans were traded at $10.03, with medium-sized ones at $10.00.

Yesterday, 9,720 bags of beans were imported and oily from Tianjin to Shanghai. Today, 250 bags were exported to Europe and 150 bags were exported to Hong Kong.

### A Short Note on the Beethoven Concert

— Jinhua

The Beethoven concert held at the American Church on Bédang Road the day before yesterday aimed to raise funds for refugee children through ticket sales. A similar charitable event, a performance of "The Holy City" by a large chorus, was held half a year ago, with remarkable success, as detailed by Chinese and foreign newspapers at the time. This time, it was still a large chorus led by Mr. Zhao Meibo, along with performances by several renowned professors. In these times of national crisis and deep suffering, we, the people abandoned on this isolated island, are dully silent as if we have no strength left to even groan. In this May, once stained with blood and symbolizing fiery passion and a tragic atmosphere, this concert dedicated solely to performing Beethoven's works will bring much excitement to people!

Out of love for Beethoven, for the passion that fills his works, for his tumultuous life, and for the sympathy and resonance in people's hearts evoked by his works, I dragged my uncle and aunt along to participate in this grand event. It was my first time participating in a concert featuring a great master. I had heard Beethoven's symphonies and piano sonatas before. His works are never easy, lighthearted, or clear-cut. Even a short piano piece leaves one with an impression of melancholy – not a silent melancholy, but a fervent, solemn, and earth-shattering cry, almost like your own cry.

He wrote two great Masses in his lifetime, one being the Mass in D and the other being the Mass in C, which was performed this time. In his religious works, as we can hear in this Mass in C, he tried to adhere to a typical religious effect, but it was secondary to expressing his zeal and reverence for God. Therefore, because his works are few in number, general experts dare not try them. Especially with a huge chorus, to perform the music itself without a single flaw seems too difficult. This time, Mr. Zhao worked tirelessly to conduct such a difficult piece, and his spirit and perseverance are deeply admirable.

At 8:30 PM, an elderly professor walked to the piano on the stage and sat down. Then, a violin and a cello harmonized, and the first program, the Trio, began. Professor Zakarov's piano playing, needless to say, had reached the point of perfection. Professor Livshitz's violin and Professor Xue's cello were able to maintain harmonious ensemble with the piano. Especially at the beginning of the third movement, the light, agile, and ethereal mood made everyone's faces light up. After the Trio, the program was a Sonata for violin and piano. The pianist was a beautiful Western lady. Although she was young, her strength was very strong, so the audience never felt any relaxation from beginning to end. Mr. Xu's violin was able to control the piano, which was indeed very strenuous. His expression of emotions was also very satisfying. Many foreign audiences paid close attention to and were amazed by this Chinese violinist.

After a few minutes of intermission following the Sonata, the grand Mass in C began. When Professor Zhao Meibo stepped onto the podium, the audience greeted him with warm applause. Then, the hundred-odd singers and the full house of listeners followed Mr. Zhao's baton and began the great Mass. Perhaps because the conductor was so serious, every singer was striving to concentrate their energy, so the power of this Mass was consistently present from the first movement to the sixth. When singing the several "Amens" at the end of the second movement, the sound was very impassioned. The fifth movement, with the entry of four soloists into the chorus, was also very moving. This was the part that I personally felt was the most brilliant performance in the entire Mass.

As for the four soloists, Ms. Zhu, the soprano, had the most rounded voice and sufficient breath. The alto was relatively weaker, and the voice was not low enough, but the notes were clear and audible. The tenor had many songs, and some places were difficult. The baritone's voice was also good, but his opportunities were few, which was a pity.

Here, I felt that there were too many sopranos, so that the soprano often covered up other parts during the large chorus. However, generally speaking, if we raise our current Chinese music level to the same height as other countries, then this large chorus cannot be said to be a great success, let alone that all the participants in the chorus are young Chinese students, training within a limited period of time to perform a great and difficult chorus, and achieving such results, what more can we ask for?

### Sincerity and Falsehood

— Buddha

In war, there is no room for aversion to deception. So it is with diplomacy. The so-called maneuvering and negotiation are all about tactics and deception. Therefore, honest people cannot be diplomats.

However, if one uses deceptive tactics all the time, others, who are not children or fools, will not be deceived. Therefore, the tricks of deception will eventually run out. Especially when there are conflicting interests, everyone should be sincere and work together.

Therefore, those who treat others with falsehood will be treated with falsehood in return; those who treat others with sincerity will be treated with sincerity in return. In the end, sincerity will prevail and falsehood will fail.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Nine: Enduring Grief and Hardship, Tears Sprinkled on All Sides; Cherishing Frugality and Labor, Ten Acres Diligently Tilled

This acting troupe, led by Mr. Jin and Ms. Wang, later went abroad. First, they went to the Nanyang Islands, then to the Philippines, then sailed to San Francisco, and then to various parts of the Americas. They used the form of drama to awaken overseas Chinese and support the motherland's resistance against the war. They planned to raise 500,000 yuan through ticket sales from overseas performances, which would be used to establish two well-equipped military hospitals in China. Who knew that after arriving in various places, the overseas Chinese of our country were so moved by their performances that the proceeds from ticket sales alone exceeded 500,000 yuan. In addition, the donations raised by the touching performances totaled 1.5 million US dollars. They then established many small factories in China to support these disabled veterans, enabling them to engage in production and make a living. Therefore, it must be said that the acting troupe's contribution during China's war was indeed significant. After Mr. Jin and Ms. Wang returned to China, they continued to work hard in the theater world. This time, when they came to Soochow University, they invited him to direct this play, "Tears of the Xiang River." Because they had been with the army during the war and had lived in Hunan for a long time, they were familiar with all the backgrounds. With him directing, it became even more realistic and reasonable. After the director's opening remarks in front of the curtain, a round of applause erupted, and the first act of the play began. Moreover, there was a miracle in today's play: the actress playing the female lead, Xiang Zi'er, in "Tears of the Xiang River," was also a female student at Soochow University. Her surname was Lin, and she was only eighteen years old, but she had eyebrows like a new moon and a face like a rosy dawn. Although schools nowadays don't have anything like the former empresses or princesses, or the insulting terms of Eastern Palace or Western Palace, her beauty could be called the best in the school. Although Miss Lin's father was Chinese, her mother was Japanese. Ten years ago, her mother's fate was almost the same as Xiang Zi in the play. The difference was that Miss Lin's father was a businessman, an overseas Chinese in Nanyang, and had passed away before returning to his homeland. Later, Miss Lin followed her mother and lived in a Japanese village for several years. Miss Lin's father was Chinese, and she wanted to come to China. Miss Lin had an uncle who also taught at Soochow University. Miss Lin's maternal grandparents were also unfortunately deceased, so she accompanied her mother to Suzhou to live with her uncle, and she herself studied at Soochow University. Of course, she could speak Japanese, having lived in Japan with her mother for several years, accustomed to Japanese customs. Dressed in Japanese women's clothing, it would be impossible to tell she was Chinese. (103)

### "The Citadel"

— Yan Hua

Produced by MGM, Showing at Cathay Theatre

When we excitedly listened to Robert Donat's speech to the medical association, we were immersed in an atmosphere of justice and fairness. Robert Donat said, "Don't you all know Louis Pasteur? He wasn't even a formal doctor! But what great contributions he left for the medical field!..." The author of this book, "The Citadel," A.J. Cronin, was perhaps also inspired by this; at least, in this work, the author launches a fierce attack on general quack doctors. Under this theme, the author created a young doctor who just graduated from medical school, finding a place for himself and barely getting married, but he was too poor. Later, due to opposition from the miners, he left the mining area and went to London. By chance, this young poor man suddenly became wealthy. Like other doctors, he didn't put patients first, until finally his good friend died at the hands of a quack doctor, and he woke up, scolding the current doctors in the medical association.

In such a story, one cannot help but think of the films "The Story of Louis Pasteur" (i.e., Louis Pasteur) and "The White Angel," which depict the noble spirit of doctors and nurses serving humanity, which cannot but move people.

Among some films that are exclusively about romance and nonsense, we have recently seen two more meaningful works from MGM (Shaw's "Pygmalion" and Cronin's "The Citadel"), which is indeed gratifying.

However, in terms of production techniques, I think "The Citadel" is far inferior to "Pygmalion." Although it was also filmed in the UK, and also uses many British actors, and also is full of the special temperament of the British, even with the support of the great director King Vidor, it still feels not tight and powerful enough.

If only the actors are considered, Robert Donat's young doctor is very well-acted, and Rosalind Russell as his wife is also very delicate and composed. But the failure of the whole film is not the failure of the actors, but the sloppiness of the script and direction. Although the film is long enough, there are still many redundant parts, while many places that should be described are passed over very hastily.

The main reason, I think, is that the screenwriter did not grasp the center of the whole play, that is to say, after writing about the young doctor Manson's change of attitude later, he should have strengthened the description of his medical absurdity and his pain when he sometimes reflects, and many unnecessary scenes, such as playing golf, etc., can be omitted. In this way, writing about his conscience after awakening will definitely achieve better results.

### Eradicate Gambling

— Cai Qing

The newspapers of the past two days have published various news about gambling dens: Three more gambling dens will be added to the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Area: The Concession authorities are strictly enforcing the blockade of traffic to gambling dens: Gambling losses involve embezzlement of accounts. Due to the simultaneous publication of these three news items (if you pay more attention, there are more records in the past newspapers), we can guess that the gambling trend, which poisons the people and disturbs public order, is probably returning to its former prosperity.

During the years of the Republic of China sixteen and seventeen, the gambling dens in the Shanghai Concession also created the highest record of terror, but finally, under the efforts of the Concession authorities, the source of crime was eliminated. After the outbreak of the war the year before last, the gambling dens in the Extra-Settlement Area began to stir again, even publishing advertisements and distributing leaflets to induce people to gamble. And the Concession authorities, because the police power could not reach, could only how to prevent it from spreading to the concession, such as strictly enforcing the blockade of traffic to the gambling dens, which shows that the greatest effort has been made within the police power. However, the increase in gambling dens, and the discovery of gambling debts and embezzlement, also show that in the end, some confused people unknowingly fall into hell.

After the war, the cost of living in Shanghai increased daily, and the number of unemployed people also increased. It seems worthy of our pity that doctors are confused, have a fluke mentality, and go to gambling dens to put everything on the line, but if you can calm down and think about it, in addition to all the huge expenses such as "protection fees" and "expenses," there are also shocking profits. If they are not recovered from the gamblers, how can these gambling dens survive? Instead of having a fluke mentality, it is better to use this spirit to work hard in one's own career. "Struggle to survive" is the motto of everyone. In this way, these gambling dens built on fragile "opportunities" will also self-destruct. Therefore, the Concession authorities' blockade of traffic to gambling dens, and everyone not gambling, is the best way to cooperate to eliminate gambling dens.

### Wartime Japanese Films

— Xin Yi

Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, their film industry has gradually declined, and the recent popularity of Japanese pornographic films can be said to be a reflection of the recession, and enough to prove the failure of their wartime cultural policy; originally, the result of excessive control over the people's freedom of thought can only deepen the reactionary psychology of the people. If you want to use art to encourage the so-called "glorious war" in order to anesthetize the people to participate in the fascist group they consider sacred, you must first restrain the people's thoughts. They know that if the subject matter of films is not limited to the narrow scope of "praising the war," it may be very detrimental to the warlords' aggression, but the Japanese people, under heavy oppression, have long seen through the warlords' expectations and no longer want to be driven by them, like lambs submissive to the hateful soldiers.

Film is a reflection of society, a propaganda of culture, and in modern countries, it has undoubtedly become a spiritual food needed by the masses. The Japanese people, having exposed the warlords' numb propaganda and various selfish and deceptive attempts, consciously abandoned various films that praised the "imperial army" and described the "sacred war," and had to look to the other side to find their net spiritual food. In this situation, pornographic films became a deformed development. Due to the unstoppable rise of anti-war sentiment in the country, pornographic films that cater to low tastes have shown a trend of activity. We speculate that the reason for the popularity of these pornographic films is nothing more than to vent the public's accumulated depression, alleviate their contradictory thoughts, and give the public a high degree of stimulation, so that they can temporarily forget the pain they are suffering. The farther the subject matter of the film is from reality, the more favorable it may be in the minds of the warlords?

An old Japanese professor said, "Shellfire destroyed the ivory tower." Yes, Japanese wartime films will never find cultural and artistic value again.

When the soldiers saw this, they could not help but feel hidden worries, so after the Minister of Culture Araki once hosted the film industry to explain the government's newly passed law prohibiting young people from watching love films, he recently banned the filming of films depicting lucky games. This is somewhat puzzling to us; we don't know whether the so-called lucky game films refer to war films, since they only understand the impropriety of lucky games, then their invasion of China, is it a gamble-style desperate lucky shot?

Because of the result of promoting war films, the various contradictory forms expressed by the Japanese film industry will become more and more obvious; and Japanese culture and art will also be buried in the hands of the warlords. Just by looking at the Japanese films wandering under the swords and guns, you can see the situation.

Lost Lamb

### George Ke Does Not Do Movies

— Hui Cun

Will Go to the Philippines to Study Wireless Electricity

The child star George Ke in Hong Kong now is still as lively and cute as in the film "Lost Lamb," but although he is still a child, he understands everything about adults thoroughly. People who see him often feel that he already has the habits of an adult. They may wonder why his innocent appearance in Shanghai disappeared so quickly? Is it the environment of Hong Kong that created him, or is it his own psychological abnormality?

He rarely acts today, and still spends his days idle. It is said that at the latest before June, he will go to the Philippines. Because he has an uncle who works at the customs there, and several brothers who also work together, one of whom is a senior staff member in a wireless electricity company, his purpose in going there is to learn wireless electricity.

George Ke's family economic situation is not very good, and the current living situation is not good. Now people no longer read him acting. Originally, child stars in Hong Kong have never been valued. Therefore, he must leave the film world and go to another society to find a way out.

### Skating Technique (20)

Application of the Body (Continued)

Furthermore, although each side has four styles, any one style on each side always has the same style as one of the other three sides, such as the first style of outward advance, the second style of outward retreat, the third style of inward advance, and the fourth style of inward retreat, which are all the same. In short, these four styles can be listed as A, B, C, and D, as in the following two tables:

When practicing, the first step can first follow the order of A, B, C, and D in the first table, and continuously practice each side. After each style is mature, the second part then refers to the second table to study which is the first and second style of a certain side? Which is the third and fourth style of a certain side? The third step can then study what style is used when or when doing what kind of pattern? If you proceed in this way, it is rare to fail.

### Great Stage Performers Comfort Isolated Army

— Jing Lu

After the Yifeng Drama Society launched the initiative to comfort the isolated army, the Great Stage performers also responded. As a result, a total of fifty-one yuan was donated, and eight dozen cans of corned beef and four dozen cans of anchovies were bought. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, they prepared an official letter and went with Li Ruilai, Han Wenkui, Li Junyu, and a reporter, and asked Wang Zhongping of the Yifeng Society to guide them.

When we arrived there, after completing the signing procedures, we entered the isolated army camp. The company commanders Shangguan Zhibiao, Tang Di, and Lei Xiong came to meet us. First, Company Commander Shangguan led us to visit their dormitory, and then we sat in his bedroom for a conversation.

They expressed their gratitude for the food we sent and said, "As long as you can come to see us, you don't have to bring anything. We feel very comforted." Company Commander Shangguan poured tea for us with a thermos, and we hurriedly thanked him and said there was no need. He said with a smile, "You came here, there is no hospitality, do you still want to save us some boiled water?" After he poured it, he handed it to us cup by cup. As I drank this cup of boiled water, I really felt it was as flavorful as jade nectar. After hearing his words, I was almost moved to tears.

Company Commander Lei excitedly reported everything that had happened in the past, and said that he could be a lawyer as soon as he went out, and that he also had parents and a wife at home, but living here, he did not feel resentful.

We talked for a long time and felt that we should leave, so we bid farewell to all the dear soldiers and agreed to meet again later. They sent us to a small gate guarded by White Russians and stopped, saying, "This area inside the barbed wire is our territory, we can only send you here, goodbye." We bowed farewell, but hearing these two sentences, we couldn't help but feel sad again, and our eyes were filled with tears that didn't flow out, and we walked back in disappointment.

It is said that the Yifeng Drama Society will go to the isolated army camp to perform today. I don't know if it can become a reality.

### Unofficial History of Liyuan

— Xu Muyun

The Reason for the Increased Status of Actors After the Republic of China

At the same time, a corpulent and wealthy man, surrounded by attendants, walked into the theater. Director-General Wu, every afternoon, except for sometimes holding some meetings, always spent the remaining free time in Boss Shang's residence. Later, this Director-General even ordered his subordinates to bring official documents to Xiao Yun's home for review. Fortunately, the Shang family had inner halls, outer living rooms, small study rooms, and many guests, so it could be accommodated. For a while, the gate of the Shang residence in Chunshu Hutong was crowded with cars and horses. Since major politicians took pleasure in supporting actors, the general petty politicians catered to the major politicians' preferences, and all tried their best to win over famous actors, considering it a shortcut to official promotion and wealth. Shang Xiaoyun had the final say in front of Wu Yulin, so the general staff and those who wanted to find a position in the department all held Xiao Yun like a god. Xiao Yun often called himself Lord Shang and often showed a proud appearance, and it was all that period that cultivated his bad character. Once, when he was performing in Shanghai, he suddenly lost a wallet on Lingpu Road when he was about to return to Beijing after the expiration of his contract. He almost cried out in anger, and immediately ordered people to call the car guard and ticket inspector to his box, and said, "Okay, even our master's things can be lost! If you can't find it back, don't even think about doing your job"! This scared them so much that they were at a loss, and they quickly asked him how much money he had lost, and everyone was willing to collect it and compensate him. Who knew that this Lord Shang would definitely not agree, and insisted on finding the original object back, and would not forgive them. When the car arrived in Tianjin, the stationmaster and section chief came to apologize to him together. Although he reluctantly agreed, after he saw his godfather Wu Er Ye in Beijing, he still insisted on dismissing the section chief and car guard. Later, someone told him not to make a big deal out of this little thing, which would cause public anger from the outside world, and that would make him look bad. He then understood that he was just an actor, and what right did he have to dismiss this and replace that, so he put the matter aside.

If we try to compare and study the reasons for the increased status of Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, Zhou Xinfang, and Sun Juxian, we can know that the two are not very different. Fortunately, the general warlords and politicians after the Northern Expedition have been completely eliminated. Otherwise, I am afraid that anyone who wants to find a small position in the military and political circles must first go to the gate of a famous actor, and then they can get what they want. May I ask if that would still be a country? —(V)—

### Qian Army Recovers Qingzhen County

(See the May issue of this newspaper in the 11th year of Tongzhi of the deposed Qing Dynasty)

The Guizhou government army has recovered Qingzhen County. (Note: Qingzhen County is inside Guiyang.) Left military gate督率精銳，直　　下，城　賊勢窮　，軍門遂旌招撫之策。投　　　，險以禍　。　　　　一文官入　　盟，方可以成撫　，軍門集眾籌商，遂議定委某司馬先人城，酋等皆伏謁極恭。經其司馬歸　後，軍門親率牟兵力百人入城受降。是役也，不　一人，軍中　　，賊大為　　云。

(Translation: The Guizhou government army has recovered Qingzhen County. (Note: Qingzhen County is inside Guiyang.) The Left Military Gate personally led the elite troops, marching directly towards the city. The rebels were in a desperate situation, so the Military Gate enacted a policy of appeasement and recruitment. [Unclear phrases]... A civil official entered the alliance, which made it possible to complete the appeasement. The Military Gate gathered the crowd to discuss and decided to commission a certain Sima to enter the city first. The chieftains and others all prostrated themselves with great respect. After the Sima returned, the Military Gate personally led hundreds of soldiers to enter the city to accept the surrender. In this battle, not one person was lost. The army [unclear phrases], and the rebels were greatly [unclear phrases], it is said.)

### Nanshi Donates Street Lights
