### The Shanxi War Situation is Developing: The Southern Shanxi Chinese Army Advances Towards Yuxiang and Jiexian, Achieving Numerous Victories; Japanese Troops at Huaxian, Longkou, and Baisiling Have Suffered a Complete Rout; Japanese Troops Landing at Chenglingji Have Been Repelled with Heavy Casualties

Xingji: For the past half-month, the focus of the Shanxi war has shifted to the Shangdang area. Following the unsuccessful Japanese offensives against Zhongtiao Mountain and LÃ¼liang Mountain last month, the enemy began in early this month to use the Pinghan, Zhengtai, Tongpu, and Daoqing railways as their bases, drawing troops from various locations in Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan to launch a large-scale nine-pronged attack on southeastern Shanxi, attempting to encircle and annihilate the Chinese army and the Chinese guerrilla bases. The first prong, consisting of over 10,000 Japanese troops from the Jiaozuo and Bo'ai areas in northern Henan, including the division and the main force of the Dianzhi unit, has been advancing north along the Bo-Jin Highway for days. The Chinese forces are holding defensive positions in the ten mountain passes east of Lanche Town, north of Bo'ai, inflicting over a thousand casualties on the Japanese. In the Battle of Baishan on the seventh, 500 Japanese soldiers were killed. The second prong, consisting of an additional Japanese division of approximately 20,000 troops from the Handan area along the Pinghan Railway, with an advance force of 4,000 to 5,000 men, advanced eastward on the fifth through Wu'an, divided at Jichengbo, Yuling, and Yetao, and were intercepted by the Chinese army near Dongyangguan. The third prong, consisting of a unit of the Japanese Independent Brigade, numbering 3,000 to 4,000 men, advanced south from Pingding along the Zhengtai Railway. After capturing Liaoxian on the third, the main force turned towards Yushe. On the sixth, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Shixiaobo (west of Liaoxian), engaging in a ten-hour battle, killing 300 Japanese soldiers, and seizing the opportunity to recapture Liaoxian on the seventh. The fourth prong, consisting of 20,000 men from the main force of the Japanese Division along the Bai-Jin Highway, captured Qin County on the fifth with a large force and Wu Township with a smaller force. Fierce fighting is taking place west of Qin County, along the Huting area. The fifth prong, consisting of 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese troops, advanced south from Pingyao via Wanghe. On the sixth, they engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese defenders at Shangxia Wutou (northwest of Qin County), where the commander of the Japanese Kambegu Detachment was killed, and his entire unit of over a thousand men was annihilated. The sixth prong, consisting of 1,000 men from a unit of the Japanese Division in Anze, attacked Qin Yuan from the northeast on the sixth. The Chinese army has withdrawn from the east of the city and is currently launching flanking attacks. The seventh prong, consisting of another unit of the Japanese Division, numbering 6,000 to 7,000 men, advanced along the Hongdong-Tunliu Road. On the second, they reached Fucheng, with a unit of over a thousand men continuing eastward to Kong Village on the third. Their main force of 8,000 to 9,000 men joined the Japanese troops in Zuoyi County to attack Qinshui. On the sixth, the Chinese army launched a coordinated attack at Nankongtan, Xiwuling, Mabi, Dayoushan, Jiaoruicun, Zhaiyita, and Dongxi Matan (all north of Qinshui), killing over 2,000 Japanese soldiers. Following a flanking attack by a certain division, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. On the eighth, the Japanese troops captured Qinshui and continued their attack on Yangcheng. On the eighth and ninth, the Chinese army launched a counter-attack in the rain and had already pushed close to the outskirts of the city. The eighth prong, based in Yicheng and Jiang County, consisted of approximately 10,000 men who engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the areas east and west of Yicheng and west of Zhangmacun on the sixth and seventh. In the battle of Zhishan Xinglongdian on the fifth, over 700 Japanese soldiers were killed in one fell swoop. The Japanese troops retreated after suffering losses and fled east along the Yi-Qin Highway. A large part of 6,000 to 7,000 men is still in the Zhangmacun area. In addition to cutting off the Japanese retreat route, the Chinese troops are also cooperating with other units to harass the Japanese. The ninth prong, consisting of a unit of Japanese troops, captured Huixian from Xinxiang and is currently surrounded by the Chinese forces, making it easy to annihilate them all. The current war situation in southeastern Shanxi is still unfolding. In addition to cooperating in blocking the enemy on the front lines, the Chinese army is also following the original plan to lure the Japanese deep and then cut them off and destroy them. The Japanese army has suffered extremely heavy losses and is currently drawing a large number of reinforcements from the Tongpu area. Taking advantage of the Japanese emptiness, the Chinese army in western Shanxi is mobilizing to attack, and battles have already broken out in the Zhaocheng Hedong area and near Linfen Zhaoqu in recent days.

Tongguan: The Japanese troops in northern Henan, Pinghan, Zhengtai, and southern Shanxi, starting from the beginning of this month, used the Fujita, Iseki, Toyoguchi, and Ushijima divisions to launch a large-scale nine-pronged attack on southeastern Shanxi. After being fiercely attacked by the Chinese army in separate ways for days, they were repelled one after another, and many victories were achieved. Currently, the Japanese troops on each route are still fighting against the Chinese army. (Fourteenth dispatch)

Changde: The Japanese troops at Chenglingji launched a fierce artillery bombardment towards the opposite bank on the morning of the fourteenth.

By the evening, the invading Japanese troops were completely repelled. In this battle, the Chinese side lost a platoon leader and suffered over ten casualties among the soldiers. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. On the same day, a certain Chinese artillery unit sank several Japanese boats on the riverside. The Japanese side also fired back, and the mutual shelling continued until six o'clock in the evening before it stopped. (Fifteenth dispatch)

Editorial

### The Erroneous View of Depositing Money in Foreign Banks

A Chongqing telegram yesterday stated that a certain economic expert gave a speech, saying that since the implementation of the restrictions on withdrawals in Shanghai, the financial market has become significantly more stable. However, some depositors still do not fully understand the interests of the nation and themselves, and there are still cases of withdrawing funds and depositing them in foreign banks. Therefore, it is hoped that Shanghai residents will quickly correct this action and not be misled by rumors and make unwise moves. As for the most appropriate method, it is to invest in the mainland, which not only meets the needs of the nation but also allows oneself to obtain substantial profits. These words, even in normal times, would still be sincere words aimed at current ills, but in today's situation, their significance is even more significant. The economic expert's words are like this, and at the same time, the Chongqing newspaper has the same opinion and uses it as a basis for commentary, which shows that the financial situation in Shanghai has a profound and huge impact on the whole country. Then, how can the citizens of Shanghai not pay attention to it?

Since the start of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people have known that the survival of the nation is at stake, and they have automatically contributed what they can without being conscripted. As the saying goes, "Those with strength contribute strength, and those with money contribute money." The ways of contributing strength are varied, and the ways of contributing money are also varied. Donations, contributions, condolences, and disaster relief are all tangible ways of contributing money. However, there is also an intangible way of contributing money, which is extremely common, and the signs are not very obvious, which is the thousands of depositors who have money in state-owned banks and other national banks. From the point of view of economic common sense, depositing money in a bank is entrusting the bank to operate the enterprise. Banks absorb the funds of countless depositors, certainly not to hide them in safes, but to invest the huge collective capital in the undertakings needed by the times. Since the Sino-Japanese War began, the coastal areas of China have fallen one after another, and the base of resistance has moved to the interior. However, the interior is full of treasures and urgently needs to be developed, in other words, it urgently needs development funds. The original funds in the interior are insufficient, and it is necessary to concentrate the funds of the whole country and give full play to their functions. This is also one meaning of "concentrating power." Therefore, the current task of Chinese banks is to use the funds that can be concentrated and invest them in the development of inland enterprises. If this policy can be implemented without hindrance, it will contribute greatly to the War of Resistance and national construction. The funds of the banks are the deposits of thousands of depositors. Then, tracing back to the source, these thousands of depositors are making a great contribution to the nation. Since Shanghai has become an international special zone because of the war, the citizens of Shanghai and the wealthy households of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which are known as the leading economic regions, have gathered in this corner, so the accumulation of funds is directly proportional to the density of the population. The thousands of depositors of Chinese banks in Shanghai are mostly residents of the special zone. Some ridicule Shanghai as a paradise that has lost its soul, but in fact, people have the same heart and the same reason. Which resident of Shanghai does not cherish his country and look forward to it with longing? Which resident does not want to use his ability to contribute his efforts? Why would he be stingy with the funds he holds, entrusting them to banks to make an indirect contribution? However, with the spread of rumors, some people have withdrawn deposits from Chinese banks and deposited them in foreign banks. Is this not a momentary delusion? In terms of politics or morality, moving funds to foreign banks is not only a matter of covering up the truth, but also a crime. Moreover, in terms of economics, it is like a mentally ill person who fears being killed and cuts off his own life. Is it not prudent to commit suicide first?

Inferring their thoughts, how could they truly be ignorant of the overall situation? Misled by rumors, they were temporarily unaware and mistakenly believed that the Chinese monetary system might fluctuate. Therefore, they thought of their own interests and gradually became accustomed to being wrong, which is the most common reason. The Japanese aggressors use military, political, and economic means to achieve their goals. Now that they are exhausted and their soldiers are tired, the strengthening of their conspiracies is timely, and rumors have a place to grow. The interior is not like this. There are many rumors in Shanghai, and the citizens are confused, which is why. However, the one who breaks the rumors is the fact that time has produced. Now that the financial market has become significantly more stable, the facts are already clear to everyone. It is truly the so-called "the damage caused by creating rumors and sabotage may be slightly affected for a time, but it is like clouds covering the sun and the moon, and in a moment, the wind dissipates and the clouds clear, and the sun and the moon are bright." Then, those who had a temporary delusion should correct it in time, and it is not too late!

### Preliminary Talks Between Britain and Japan: Discussing the Tianjin Incident; Craigie Met with Arita Yesterday Morning; The Talks Lasted Five Hours with Strict Security

(Tokyo) The preliminary talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Foreign Minister Arita this morning lasted from 9:05 AM to 12:30 PM. Neither secretaries nor stenographers were present during the talks. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a communique in the afternoon, stating that the meeting lasted over three hours. Craigie and Arita discussed the general issues that formed the background of the situation that occurred in Tianjin. The meeting is temporarily adjourned to allow sufficient time for further consideration, and the meeting will be held again on July 17. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) British Ambassador Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at 9:05 this morning, which was the beginning of the upcoming Anglo-Japanese conference. Japanese newspapers stated that if the Japanese Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador cannot resolve the "fundamental issues," the so-called "local incident conference" will not be held. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie began negotiations this morning. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement as follows: Today, the Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador negotiated at the Foreign Ministry on the issue of the Tianjin incident. The meeting lasted three hours and then dispersed. The next round of talks is scheduled for next Monday (seventeenth). The vicinity of the Foreign Ministry and the British Embassy was very quiet today, but the newspapers' comments were veryæ¿, demanding that the government take a firm attitude and not compromise. (Fifteenth Haitong dispatch)

(Tokyo) This newspaper reported that when the Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador negotiated this morning, there was no third person present. Usually, there are interpreters, but this time there were no interpreters at all. It is reported that at the beginning of the negotiations, the Japanese Foreign Minister stated the Japanese side's opinions, and the British Ambassador detailed the British side's opinions. (Fifteenth Haitong dispatch)

(London) The diplomatic correspondent of The Times stated that the fate of the Tokyo Conference may be revealed tomorrow or Monday. The British government must insist that the talks be limited to local issues related to the blockade of Tianjin. Government officials believe that the Japanese cabinet has not publicly acknowledged the semi-official news published in Japanese newspapers regarding the clauses in the agenda. This may be a good sign, but the British government is now preparing everything to prevent any incident. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

(London) Regarding the anti-British demonstrations held in Tokyo yesterday, the Foreign Office received a report from Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, this morning and is carefully studying it. According to official statements, the report submitted by Ambassador Craigie has confirmed the news published in the newspapers. (Fifteenth Havas dispatch)

The Significance of Moving the Location to Tokyo

(Chongqing) The Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo has now opened. The Chinese people in various sectors here are paying close attention to its progress. The biggest question in their minds is how many concessions Britain will make to meet Japan's demands. The fact that Britain did not adopt a strong plan in Tianjin, but agreed to endure humiliation and hold negotiations in Tokyo, is seen by the Chinese as Britain's eagerness to resolve the issue in a compromise manner and prevent it from escalating. All parties believe that the outcome of the conference will have a far-reaching impact on the Far East situation, especially on the Sino-Japanese War. According to Chinese opinion, the negotiation was moved from Tianjin to Tokyo, not because Japan intended to resolve the issue peacefully, but because Japan was confident that it could discuss broader issues with Britain in Tokyo that could not be discussed by local officials in Tianjin. As for the Japanese government's current permission for Tokyo citizens to hold anti-British demonstrations to vent public anger, the Chinese people in various sectors do not believe it, saying that the purpose of the Japanese people's demonstrations is twofold: one is to strengthen Japan's hand in the negotiations, and the other is to offset the widespread belief that the Tianjin blockade was launched entirely by the Japanese military authorities. They also said that the Tokyo negotiations will never resolve the Tianjin incident. If Britain does not yield, Japan will not be willing to give up. If Britain is willing to yield, then why is this meeting necessary? Moreover, the Tianjin blockade is a plan that the Japanese side had already decided on months ago, and it is just using the issue of the extradition of four people as an excuse to launch it. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

Talks by the Japanese Military Commander in Tianjin

(Tokyo) According to local news today, Lieutenant General Honma, the Japanese military commander in Tianjin, said yesterday when he received Japanese newspaper reporters that, in view of the full support of the Japanese people for the isolation of the British and French concessions in Tianjin in the past month, it can be seen that it is necessary for us to implement our original goals. If the British side insists on limiting the scope of the conference to local incidents, the conference will inevitably break down. We firmly believe that the Japanese government will be able to fully represent the opinions of local officials and the people of the whole country. The British position is now at a crossroads. Only Britain itself can choose whether Britain will stand in an adversarial position with us, and it must make a decisive decision. Honma said that if the conference breaks down, Japan will take measures to prepare for any eventuality. (Fifteenth Associated Press dispatch)

Britain Considers Ways to Aid China

(London) Government officials implied last night that if Japan insists on making excessive demands during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations held in Tokyo today, Britain intends to take retaliatory actions, that is, to provide General Chiang Kai-shek with new military credit loans. China is negotiating with Britain, requesting that Britain lend China a credit loan of 3 million pounds out of Britain's 60 million pound foreign trade credit loan. If Japan raises broad issues as a solution to the Tianjin incident during the Tokyo negotiations, then the Sino-British credit loan negotiations can be concluded after the Tokyo negotiations are completed. Britain is using financial aid to China as another strategy in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The planned credit loan of 3 million pounds can help China manufacture aircraft and munitions factories and purchase equipment for manufacturing heavy artillery. At present, China's munitions industry can only manufacture light weapons such as rifles and machine guns. China can also purchase electrical plants and other civil engineering equipment to develop China's inland industries. Britain requires the Bank of China to guarantee the credit loan, but General Chiang Kai-shek proposed that the Bank of Communications guarantee it, because the Bank of China has already guaranteed the US Export-Import Bank's loan of US$25 million to China. China's military needs are endless. After the negotiations on the 3 million pound credit loan are completed, the issue of continued financial aid to China will be considered. Observers here believe that unless the Japanese military authorities release Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the British military attache to China who was detained by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou on May 26, it is very likely that Britain will continue to provide loans to China. Japan undoubtedly holds a strong card in the Tokyo negotiations, but the fact that Britain intends to take retaliatory actions when Japan makes excessive demands shows that Britain is ready to resist Japan's challenge to dominate China, especially North China. If the United States passes the Pittman Act and imposes broad sanctions on Japan, Britain's ability to resist Japan will be greatly enhanced. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will also follow in the footsteps of the United States and submit the same bill to the House of Commons. Japan deeply feels that Britain is constrained by European problems and understands the inadequacy of Britain's forces stationed in the Far East. Tokyo also feels that Britain is unwilling to impose economic sanctions on Japan alone, unless the United States has initiated it first. Britain will take a comfortable attitude towards the negotiations between Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. If the negotiations break down or the Anglo-Japanese conflict worsens, the negotiations should be postponed indefinitely. If the Japanese side raises demands that are not directly related to the Tianjin case, the British Ambassador will reply that the issues must be discussed with the United States and France before they can be resolved. (Fifteenth Associated Press dispatch)

Chongqing's Observation of the Future

(Tokyo) Chinese people are now watching the development of the Anglo-Japanese conference to be held in Tokyo with the utmost concern, because the outcome of the conference will have a far-reaching impact on the Far East situation, and especially the Sino-Japanese War. Chinese newspapers and the public have always doubted the success of the conference. It is said that if the purpose of the parties involved is purely to resolve the Tianjin dispute and both sides have a spirit of mutual concession, then the conference can succeed. However, Japan currently has no intention of resolving the Tianjin case unless Britain succumbs and accepts Tokyo's broader demands. The hope that London has that Japan will not raise broader issues at the Tokyo conference is considered by the Chinese here to be bound to be disappointed, because the blockade of Tianjin was not issued only for local incidents. Japan has already carefully prepared to make a clear expression to Britain in North China in the past few months. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to the observations of the general Chinese people, Anglo-Japanese relations cannot improve in a short time. However, given the seriousness of the European situation, Britain may not allow its relations with Japan to deteriorate. Chinese people believe that British and Japanese interests in the Far East, especially in China, are now in direct conflict, so it is expected that Anglo-Japanese relations cannot improve in a short time. According to Chinese people, Japan is now doing its best to secretly harm foreign interests and forces in China, and Britain has the greatest interests in China. However, Britain, which has already been greatly discriminated against by the Japanese side, will not give up its huge interests that it has obtained through years of hard work. Britain has previously adopted the most moderate policy in the Far East, originally because the British government believed that Japan never had the true intention of discriminating against Britain, and partly because Britain has been preoccupied with matters in Europe and other places in the past ten years and could not pay full attention to the Far East. Since this conflict of interests has existed for a long time, Anglo-Japanese relations cannot improve, it is said. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

London Newspapers Express Pessimism

(London) Regarding the negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities in Tokyo, the morning papers have just commented, expressing pessimism. The Daily Mail wrote, "This negotiation is difficult to be optimistic. There is a great divergence of opinion between the two sides on how to define the scope of the negotiation. Although the Tianjin incident only concerns one country, Britain, if Japan wants Britain to change its current Far East policy, then other countries that have interests in the Far East are obviously all involved. However, it can be asserted that Britain will not yield to the Japanese warlords and violate the promises it made to the Nine-Power Treaty." The News Chronicle wrote, "According to the news coming from the Far East, it is better to say that the Japanese are trying to cause trouble rather than that they are happy to negotiate peacefully. For the sake of precaution, we should temporarily withdraw from the concessions that cannot be protected within China, and at the same time inform the Japanese government that, apart from this, Britain must take all measures to safeguard its interests in the Far East." The diplomatic correspondent of The Times declared, "Whether the negotiation can achieve anything depends on whether the Japanese government only limits it to local incidents. If the authorities of that country rashly raise other issues, such as the issue of British cooperation with Japan in North China, as the country's newspapers speculate, then the British government should declare that such issues not only harm British interests, but also endanger the interests of the United States, France, and other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty under the open-door policy. It is not appropriate to discuss it. Regarding the content of the agenda, what has been published by the Japanese semi-official agencies has not been confirmed by the Japanese cabinet. This may be considered a good omen by the British diplomatic authorities, but the arrival of incidents cannot be prevented. The British government has also prepared coping methods."

### England Adopts a Firm Stance: Japan Will Not Dare to Challenge; Speech by British-American General Keyes

(London) Admiral Keyes, commander of the British naval fleet, stated in a speech in London today that if the British government adopts a firm stance, Japan will not dare to clash with the British Empire. He had many close interactions with Japan in the two previous wars. During the siege of Beijing in 1900, when he coordinated operations with the Japanese army, he highly valued the fighting spirit of the Japanese soldiers. However, this spirit no longer exists in the Japanese navy and army. Japan is now faithfully imitating the methods of its ally, Germany. Japan should not be so foolish as to believe that Germany and its allies can escape a disastrous defeat after recklessly launching wars against Britain, France, Poland, and Turkey. Therefore, it would be wise for Japan not to push Britain too far. This is his opinion. The British Empire's financial resources, industry, and manpower are united and determined to resist the enemy. If the enemy knows this, they will not provoke Britain. If they do, the enemy will only face defeat. (Fourteenth Reuters telegram)

### British House of Commons Discusses Credit Loans to China; Members Advocate Full Assistance to China; Hudson States Negotiations Are in Progress

(London) Conservative Member of Parliament Morgan said in the House of Commons today, regarding export credit loans to China, that according to general public opinion in the country, the only country Britain should assist is China, which is currently in a difficult situation. This was said during a discussion in the House of Commons after Overseas Trade Minister Hudson moved a government overseas trade guarantee bill. Labor Member of Parliament Bellenger said that the House of Commons has no power to question the financial measures taken by the Overseas Trade Department under this bill. On July 10th, he asked Hudson to announce how much guarantee would be given to British trade in China, which is most closely related to British commerce. However, Hudson replied that the department does not usually disclose the figures guaranteed for any one country. But this morning, he saw that the second clause of this bill clearly stipulates that a list must be submitted to the House of Commons at an appropriate time, indicating the figures guaranteed to various countries under this bill. He felt that this clause was very different from what Hudson had answered previously. Therefore, he now requests Hudson to provide the information he wants on Monday, which is not unreasonable, because he has some criticisms about the Overseas Trade Department's funding of British trade in China. Britain has spent very little on China, which it claims to sympathize with as a civilly governed country. Therefore, he requests Hudson to state how much assistance Britain has already given to China and how much assistance will be given to China under this bill in the future. Morgan continued to speak, saying that China has requested millions of pounds, but he does not know if Britain has only lent China hundreds of thousands of pounds. If so, although the government approves of the principle of assisting the Chinese government, the loan has not been paid out due to the numerous branches of the government's office. He wonders if the Americans have a broader perspective than the British. It seems that the Americans have taken the lead in the Chinese market, such as in the trade of goods needed for construction. He thinks the Americans must have some assurance of return before lending China five million pounds. Labor member Noel Baker said, "I deeply believe that it is in Britain's interest to treat China generously under this bill. He advocated that China should be included in the scope of this bill and given new credit loans in addition to the original loans. The terms of the commercial agreement with China should be lenient. Britain can serve its most important interests in no better way than through this bill. The Japanese militarists have now openly demanded to be allowed to freely establish their so-called new order in China. Britain, France, and other Western countries do not want to comply with Japan's demands. The British government does not want to give up its position, but if the Chinese army's resistance collapses in the end, it would undoubtedly be a huge blow to Britain's Eastern interests, and also a blow to the entire peace front in the world. Therefore, it is in Britain's interest to help China. Now, Britain, its autonomous territories, and its affiliated territories, such as India, absorb more than 40 percent of Japan's exports, which is insane behavior. If Hudson treats China with great generosity, he should help break the new method of financial aggression that the Japanese are currently planning to impose on Chinese legal tender. China is in dire need of funds. Five million pounds in China can produce the same effect as investing fifty million pounds in Europe. We should view China as a part of the peace front's security. What we should be concerned about is not only trade in Tianjin, but also the great principles for which China is fighting, and these principles are the foundation upon which the British government claims its foreign policy is based." Overseas Trade Minister Hudson rose to make closing remarks, saying that a portion of the ten million pounds in the Export Guarantees Act is used for China. This is an open secret. This amount has not yet been exhausted. It is difficult to agree on what China needs most. Negotiations are still in progress. Yesterday, he also met with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. As for the question of announcing the figures assumed for China, there is no objection to announcing the details of ordinary commercial transactions. He believes that it is generally recognized that individual transactions should not be investigated. (Fourteenth Reuters telegram)

### Anti-British Movement in Japan Intensifies

(Tokyo) Anti-British demonstrations continued in Japan yesterday, especially in Tokyo and Osaka. Representatives of several groups submitted anti-British resolutions to the government and military, and a delegation presented a memorandum to the British embassy, stating Japan's minimum demands. Speeches delivered at mass rallies denounced Britain as a "disturber of peace in the East" or even as an "enemy of mankind," showing the sharpness of their rhetoric and the use of all possible means. Japanese newspapers today published editorials calling on the government not to compromise. Japanese political figures believe that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations that began this morning will not be concluded in a few days, as the issues under discussion are complex and not easy to resolve at once. (Fifteenth Haida telegram)

### The Soviet Union Expresses Firm Determination to Defend Outer Mongolia As It Would Defend Its Own Territory

(Moscow) Regarding the conflict on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border, political figures here recently stated that it is difficult to determine whether this conflict is merely an ordinary border dispute or whether Japan, with the consent of the great powers, is planning to provoke a conflict to divert the Soviet government's attention before the establishment of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact. However, Outer Mongolia is of strategic importance to the Soviet Union. Therefore, if Japan takes action against Outer Mongolia, the Soviet government will inevitably defend it as it would defend its own territory. (Fourteenth Havas telegram)

### Hong Kong Government Promulgates Compulsory Military Service Law; To Be Implemented After Legislative Council Approval; Related to British Far East Policy

(Hong Kong) Due to the increasingly tense international situation and Hong Kong's important position as the first line of defense in the Far East, the Hong Kong government promulgated a compulsory military service law on the 15th, requiring all British men in Hong Kong to enlist. It will be implemented immediately after being passed by the Legislative Council meeting on the 20th. Hong Kong will be the first British territory to implement a military service system. (Fifteenth special telegram)

(Hong Kong) It is reported that a bill has been submitted to the Legislative Council to force British people to receive training in local volunteer forces. (Fifteenth Reuters telegram)

(Hong Kong) Next Thursday, the Hong Kong government will submit a government ordinance to the Legislative Council, calling up Chinese and British men aged 15 to 55 to perform compulsory service, with the aim of creating a reserve force. This plan is not the same as the conscription system known in Britain and elsewhere. It will only apply to British people for the time being. The authorities issued an explanatory statement, stating that the purpose of the compulsory service plan is to create a reserve force, and this reserve force will not interfere with the ordinary work of the British. (Fifteenth Reuters telegram)

(Hong Kong) The local government authorities last night ordered all British men to participate in Hong Kong's defense work. Today, all parties believe that this matter is of great significance to Britain's Far East policy. Since the establishment of the National Defense Registration Office this spring, the people here have been speculating about compulsory military service. The implementation of the conscription plan should be attributed to Japan's anti-British movement and the gloomy nature of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. Also, Hong Kong's Micro-Military Bill will be passed before the end of this month, so some people here firmly believe that the Hong Kong authorities have reversed their two-year wait-and-see attitude and joined the Far Eastern war situation. The name of the bill is the "Compulsory Military Service Ordinance," and its drafting is based on the "Universal Military Service Act" of 1918 (which was repealed in 1919). It is said that the purpose of implementing the compulsory military service ordinance is to form a strong reserve army, which is similar in nature to the volunteer group. In the future, all British men aged 18 to 55 will be required to enlist. The first reading of this case has been set for the 20th of this month, and then a second reading review will be held on the 27th of this month, and a third reading can be passed before the 31st of this month. It is also learned that Hong Kong Governor Luo Fuguo will set up a "Compulsory Military Service Court" to vote for those who evade military service. Therefore, those who fail to pass the physical examination within the specified time limit will be fined 250 Hong Kong dollars and sentenced to six months in prison. In addition, an appeals court will be set up, presided over by the Chief Justice of Hong Kong, to hear cases of dissatisfaction with the original judgment. In the future, the people who should be recruited under this ordinance will be incorporated into the Hong Kong Defense Reserve Team. As for the British people affected by this ordinance, the number is only about 500. According to official statistics, there are 2,500 British men in this city, and only 1,700 of them cannot be exempted from military service for some reason. However, 1,000 of them have joined the volunteer group to serve, and at least 200 of them are not physically fit. Therefore, only 500 people can join the reserve army. The current naval and army stationed in Hong Kong are about 7,500 people, half of whom are regular troops. In the event of an emergency, the regular troops, volunteer groups, and reserve troops that can be dispatched will be about 5,000 people. Also, Chinese who have acquired British nationality will not be bound by the new regulations, but the Sino-British Defense Registration Office authorities have now compiled a list of Chinese born in Hong Kong, and they will also be drafted into the army if necessary, so the number of reserve troops will definitely increase as a result. The news about this Micro-Military Plan has been kept secret for a long time, until it was disclosed to reporters by the authorities last night. According to neutral observers, the Hong Kong government's Micro-Military move is enough to show that the British authorities will not allow any enemy to approach Hong Kong. However, many people here believe that Britain will not defend the Hong Kong colony at a great cost in a large-scale war. (Fifteenth Associated Press telegram)

### Anti-British Sentiment in Qingdao Slightly Eases

(Qingdao) Since yesterday evening, Japanese Marines have been stationed outside various British commercial firms, and a large number of Chinese employees have received notices instructing them to report to the police station. However, the situation here is still very peaceful. The demonstration originally scheduled for today has been cancelled. The British Consulate has been heavily guarded since two small bombs were thrown into it last night, destroying two cellar windows. The Japanese authorities have begun investigating this matter. Because the Japanese Marines stationed outside the various British commercial firms do not interfere with the operations of the firms, it is believed that the purpose of the garrison is to protect them, fearing that the Chinese employees who report to the police station may be forced to resign. This morning, British Rear Admiral Moray arrived here on the cruiser Cornwall, 89,750 tons. In addition, the only British ship docked in this port is the destroyer Diamond (1,375 tons). (Fifteenth Reuters telegram)

### "Qingdao Conference" Produces No Results

(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, the Qingdao conference between the northern and southern puppet governments failed to produce any results in the discussion of organizing a puppet central government. The reason is that the views of the Japanese military authorities differ. Among them, the Doihara faction, including the generals of the Kwantung Army, advocated wooing Wu Peifu, but Wu insisted on territorial integrity and refused to make concessions, so it has not been realized. The Yingzuo faction, which is responsible for wooing Wang Jingwei, does not seem to have reached a harmonious agreement with the Doihara faction. Another faction is led by General Sugiyama, commander of the Japanese army in North China, and is supported by the generals of the Japanese army in North China. It is said that they intend to maintain the "Provisional Government" headed by Wang Kemin. Regarding this, Japanese newspapers reported that the joint committee of the northern and southern puppet governments will still hold its sixth meeting in Qingdao, which shows that the Japanese and the northern and southern puppets attending the fifth Qingdao Conference did not reach a compromise on the issue of merging the puppet governments. In addition, there is a rumor that the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in North China will be replaced recently. If this rumor is confirmed, the emergence of the puppet organization will be further delayed. (Fifteenth telegram)

### Japanese Claim British Are Spying on Military Intelligence

(Tokyo) According to Japanese communications received here from Beiping, it is said that some British people in North China, who are close to the Japanese army in North China, are engaged in espionage activities to harm the Japanese army. The authorities of the Japanese army in North China are extremely concerned about this discovery, especially at a time when British military officer Spierke is being detained on charges of espionage. The communication also listed several cases of British people acting as spies, saying that a British missionary in southern Shanxi reported the movements of the Japanese army to the Chinese army in Luan. When the Japanese army was about to fight, he often traveled to and from the railway station in Quwo, southeast Shanxi. Another British missionary, who was allowed by the Japanese army to accommodate Chinese refugees in the church, was also engaged in spying on military intelligence. A British expatriate in Yicheng, southern Shanxi, would have a large number of Chinese troops attack the Japanese defense forces after each trip he took. After investigation, it was found that this British person was supplying intelligence to the Chinese army. British missionaries in Hongdong and Linfen were also found to have reported the movements of the Japanese army to the Chinese army in Luan. An English person in Xia County, southeastern Shanxi, advised the Chinese not to accept the free medical treatment of the Japanese Comfort Corps. Another English person spread rumors that "the Soviet Union and other countries will soon unite to impose economic sanctions on Japan" and "Federal Reserve banknotes will become waste paper, and the Chinese should not accept them."

### US Protests Again to Japan Over Bombing of American Property

The second was that when Japanese aircraft bombed Jianning, Fujian, on June 25, a bomb fell outside the wall of the American church and destroyed the new house of the orphanage.

### China and France Establish New Chamber of Commerce

(Chongqing) According to reliable Chinese and French sources speaking to the Associated Press today, China and France plan to organize a Sino-French Chamber of Commerce next month in order to place bilateral commercial relations on a solid foundation and promote close cooperation between the two countries in the Far East. The Chamber of Commerce is semi-official in nature, and the two governments will participate in it based on economic principles. The association will not comment on political events, and its scope will be limited to promoting commercial relations between the two countries. Well-informed sources claim that the new Chamber of Commerce will improve relations between Vietnam and China and will be used to implement what is stipulated in the Nanjing Treaty. That treaty promises China that it may import arms, etc. into China via Vietnam as needed. (Fifteenth Associated Press telegram)

### Military Commission Organization Personnel; Chiang Kai-shek Concurrently Chairman of the Aviation Committee; Has Absolute Command Over Citizen Army

### Roosevelt and Hull Send Messages to Congress; Promote Amendment of the Neutrality Act; In the Interest of National Security; Request That Partisan Strife Be Eliminated and That the Matter Be Reconsidered

(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress yesterday, requesting that the amendment to the Neutrality Act be approved before the recess, and that the existing clause of the Neutrality Act prohibiting the embargo of arms be repealed. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull also sent a special message to Congress, stating that he fully agreed with the President's proposal. According to the President's message, "For the sake of American neutrality and security, I deeply feel that this Congress should take some necessary actions to deal with the existing international situation. I have no reason to change this position. If Congress does not do this, then Congress should be responsible for getting into a war crisis." (Fifteenth Associated Press telegram)

Hull's message solemnly stated the necessity of avoiding misunderstandings and misinterpretations of American foreign policy by the general public. He said that the United States' policy is to continue to maintain peace, and that he must clarify the six major guidelines of the Neutrality Act. According to Hull's six major guidelines, they are the basic principles of the Bloom Neutrality Bill, which has been amended by the House of Representatives and whose discussion has been postponed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Hull requested that Congress eliminate all partisan strife over the bill. Hull pointed out that the Neutrality Act is extremely important to the security of the United States in the coming months. Hull solemnly stated that there will be a war crisis abroad soon, and that some people at home and abroad have great misunderstandings about the Neutrality Act. (Fifteenth Associated Press telegram)

### Hull Clarifies Six Major Principles of the Neutrality Act: Repeal of the Arms Embargo Clause Considered an Effective Way to Prevent War

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull's message to Congress, totaling six pages, states the government's reasons for advocating the repeal of the arms embargo clause. It first states that the current goals of U.S. foreign policy are twofold: first, to maintain peace and safeguard the security of the country, and second, to strengthen international law and promote international integrity. Peace is extremely valuable, while war is a great calamity. The duty of the American people and government is to assist in maintaining peace to the best of their ability. "Given the precarious international situation, peace-loving countries like ours cannot ignore such abnormal and urgent situations when proposing peace and neutrality policies. On the contrary, the entire issue of peace and neutrality, and its potential impact on American security and interests in the coming months, should be closely monitored. In my view, the government should take action immediately and not delay without reason, missing opportunities. The arms embargo clause should be repealed. Those who advocate maintaining it believe that this measure can prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war, but in reality, it only deceives American public opinion, leading it to believe in false and unreasonable fantasies." According to this clause, arms, ammunition, and various military supplies are prohibited from being exported, while other goods necessary for warfare can continue to be exported. How can this be considered reasonable?

Previously, I sent a letter to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress, requesting the cancellation of the arms embargo clause and proposing a neutrality plan divided into six points, which can guarantee to the greatest extent that the United States will not be drawn into the vortex of war. The so-called six points are: (1) Prohibit American ships from entering war zones; (2) Restrict Americans from entering war zones; (3) For all American goods transported to belligerent countries, ownership should be transferred to foreign buyers before export; (4) The current method of prohibiting cash or credit loans to belligerent countries should be maintained; (5) Establish regulations for fundraising for belligerent countries; (6) The current monitoring system for arms exports and the current method of applying for permits should be maintained. All these six points are the result of careful research. If war breaks out in the future, this will be the best way to prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex, compared to the current Neutrality Act. "It is broad in scope and more effective, and it does not seem likely to cause any accidents, and it is sufficient to make the outbreak of war more difficult. If our country strictly maintains neutrality, the crisis of being drawn into war will also be reduced accordingly. At a time when international anarchy is so serious and peace is threatened in many places, I believe that the first step to protect our country from being drawn into war is to use our country's power, within the scope of not violating traditional policies, to minimize the possibility of a world war breaking out. The government's responsibility lies in this, and this is something that everyone can see clearly and cannot deny."

The neutrality bill advocated by the government is not only in line with international law, but also does not contradict the policies pursued by the United States for 150 years. "For many years, the government has been working diligently within the scope of traditional policies to avoid the outbreak of a major war. If we harbor prejudices and favor certain foreign countries, providing assistance to some and disfavoring others, then why bother trying to avoid war? Certain aspects should convey the result, giving people the impression that if the arms embargo is repealed, the executive power will become enormous. Conversely, maintaining the embargo can limit executive power. This statement is not accurate. If the American market is opened to the public, allowing all countries to come and purchase goods without distinction, I do not see how the president can gain the power to act expediently. If we maintain the embargo, it will only benefit those countries that have already expanded their military and have an advantage. As for small countries whose arms supplies depend on countries like the United States, if we refuse to allow them to obtain the tools necessary for defense, then countries that uphold international law and love peace will be unable to defend themselves in a serious situation. Is this reasonable?" (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Congressional Figures Hold Different Views: Opposition Parties Have Deep-Rooted Prejudices, Making It Difficult to Expect a Change in Attitude

(Washington) President Roosevelt's message to Congress and Secretary of State Hull's statement have been commented on by observers, saying that if the arms embargo clause is not repealed, leading to consequences in the international situation, then the responsibility should be borne by Congress. This is the government's intention. A careful reading of Hull's message reveals that the main point is that the neutrality amendment advocates all want the United States to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, but they differ on how to achieve this goal. Furthermore, repealing the arms embargo clause is not sufficient to increase the risk of the United States participating in the war. If war breaks out in the future, the United States does not want to take sides, and what it seeks is to avoid war. Although all these points are logical, the opposition parties have deep-rooted prejudices, so there is little hope of expecting Congress to change its attitude. Republican Senator Borah stated that Secretary of State Hull's message does not contain any arguments that can make Congress make a decision on the neutrality issue during this session. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Secretary of State Hull's message is righteous and irrefutable, but it is still difficult to predict whether Congress's attitude will be influenced. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Chongqing Newspaper Observes U.S. Political Situation: If Isolationists Gain Power, Foreign Policy Will Be Affected

(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily published an article this morning, saying that the difficulties the U.S. authorities are currently encountering regarding the Neutrality Act have no impact on China. The amendment to the Neutrality Act planned by the U.S. authorities is aimed at dealing with the European situation, so it has nothing to do with the Far East incident. The only possible impact on China is that the Senate's opposition to President Roosevelt's policies may strengthen the power of American isolationists. If this is the case, it will be difficult for President Roosevelt to adopt a more active policy in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Launch Fundraising Campaign to Purchase Medical Supplies

Yang stated that, through the cooperation of the New York-based American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, two million doses of cholera vaccine have already been shipped to China. He said that he had reached an agreement with the Philippine health authorities that each dose of vaccine would only cost one U.S. cent. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

### U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Discusses the Pittman Proposal, Believes It Conflicts with U.S.-Japan Commerce Treaties, Many Express Opposition

(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently submitted a proposal to authorize the President to prohibit the transportation of arms, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to countries that destroy the Nine-Power Treaty (referring to Japan). The Foreign Relations Committee submitted it for discussion today. It was immediately pointed out that the current commercial treaties between the United States and Japan (established in 1911) stipulate that neither signatory country can impose discriminatory treatment on the other. The two countries also have treaties stipulating mutual consultation procedures. If the above proposal is passed, it may legally conflict with these treaties. It was decided to first consult Secretary of State Hull for his opinion. Pittman also made a statement to the newspapers, saying that he would wait for Secretary of State Hull to submit a written response before holding another meeting. According to a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, many senators oppose Pittman's proposal based on legal and diplomatic considerations, and they fear that Japan may use this as an excuse to directly harm American interests in the Far East and suspend the purchase of American cotton as retaliation. (Japan is the largest customer of American cotton), so there are also many who believe that this is unacceptable. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### The United States Intensifies the Construction of Naval Ports: Twelve Locations in Two Oceans, Expected to be Completed Within Three Years

(Washington) The United States has decided to build twelve aviation and submarine bases in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with a cost of $65 million. Currently, there are as many as 100 companies competing for the construction rights. These twelve bases have been approved by Congress, and $31,621,000 has been allocated from the 1940 naval budget as construction costs. It is reported that the locations of the twelve bases are as follows: Saint John, Bautista (a key point for the defense of the Panama Canal), Kanna Zhi and Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Sitka and Kodiak in Alaska, Midway Island, Dehan Island, and Palmer Island in the Pacific. The land bases are in Hampshire, Jacksonville, and Wright's Corner. According to naval experts, this project will take three years to complete. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

### Preparations for Pacific Warfare: Japan Actively Builds Ships, a "Mysterious" Battleship is Launched

(London) London reports that a Japanese "mysterious" battleship, named Shokaku, was recently launched at the Yokosuka Shipyard. Because Japan adheres to a policy of secrecy in building warships, its contents cannot be known. According to a naval dispatch from the "Daily Telegraph," Prince Fushimi, Navy Minister Yonai, and two other members of the imperial family attended the launching ceremony, which shows that the ship must be different from ordinary warships. This ship may be one of the three or four battleships with a displacement of over 40,000 tons that were started in 1936, or it may be an aircraft carrier. The Japanese new fleet has 93 warships, of which some have been completed and some are about to be completed, totaling 221,492 tons, including 5 aircraft carriers totaling 47,000 tons, 6 cruisers totaling 51,000 tons, 26 destroyers, 15 submarines, torpedo boats, minesweepers, submarines, destroyers, and 20 auxiliary ships. There is some evidence that the new battleships will have at least ten 16-inch guns, and it is certain that the new submarines belong to the so-called Pan-Pacific class, which has the ability to travel 8,000 miles without refueling.

### Germany Adopts Gradual Approach in Attempt to Seize Danzig Without Bloodshed: Hitler Gives Instructions to Forster, Military Preparations on Polish Border Remain Unabated

(London) Several Germans have just arrived here from Berlin. According to them, when FÃ¼hrer Hitler met with Forster, the leader of the Nazi Party in the Free City of Danzig, at his villa in Berchtesgaden yesterday, he had a long conversation about the situation in the city. It is said that he told Forster that the future of the Free City of Danzig could be practically resolved in three stages within a year: (1) When the Nazi Party Congress is held in Nuremberg in September of this year, the Senate of the Free City of Danzig will announce that all citizens of the city have German citizenship, but there will be no change in the city's legal status. (2) Announce that all railways and the Port of Danzig will be managed by Germany. (3) Announce that customs administration will be transferred to Germany. When these two matters are announced and implemented, the governments of Germany and Poland should be notified separately, and the accomplished fact should be placed before all countries.

### Anglo-Polish Agreement: Signing Postponed, Issues Regarding the Use of Loans Arise Temporarily

(London) The financial agreement between Britain, France, and Poland was originally scheduled to be signed today, but it was not completed due to a temporary issue. According to well-informed sources, the problem lies in how the credit loan granted by Britain to Poland will be used. Poland urgently needs to purchase arms, but at present, British arms manufacturers are extremely busy and it is difficult to deliver goods quickly. The Polish government therefore wants to use part of the loan to purchase American arms, while the British government deeply hopes that the loan will be used entirely in Britain. Moreover, if the Polish government's proposal is followed, difficulties will inevitably arise due to the different exchange rates when converting pounds into dollars. The two sides will continue to discuss in the hope of finding a solution that benefits both sides. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### British Air Minister Speaks: British Air Force is Great, Opens a New Page in History, Air Defense Equipment is Also Improved

(London) Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood visited the new Rolls-Royce factory in Creech today, and then gave a speech at a banquet, saying that Britain's efforts in air defense have never been greater in history than they are today, except for the final stages of the European War. The increase in personnel and various plans to increase strength have made it necessary to submit a supplementary air force budget. This budget will allow the air force to continue to increase its staff by 32,000 people and continue to obtain funds of 40 million pounds, so that the cost of air force service this year will reach a new height of 260 million pounds. When the domestic defense exercise is held next month, the public will have another opportunity to see the progress of air defense. Sir Wood also said that the Royal Air Force is now showing its power overseas, which is of great help to the training of the air force. He hoped that the delegation of the air force to France this decision will be followed by an increase in the current aircraft production in other parts of Britain, so that Britain can allocate a large number of military aircraft for use by friendly countries. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

(London) Regarding British air defense equipment, the authorities recently issued a bulletin, providing detailed explanations. It is said that there are currently 850,000 steel bomb shelters nationwide, which can protect 5.2 million residents. As of June, air defense team members had a total of 1 million steel helmets, which will reach 1.9 million by the end of July. Government offices in various places have provided volunteer service team members with a total of 1.1 million gas masks, 600,000 sets of lightweight oilcloth uniforms, 60,000 sets of heavyweight oilcloth uniforms, 700,000 pairs of rubber boots, 600,000 pairs of goggles, 207,000,000 sandbags, 6.5 million triangular bandages, 80,000 surgical splints, 12 million safety pins, and 8,000 fire brigade water dragons.

### First Batch of 500,000 Soldiers Transferred to Xinjiang Front; Guangxi Province Implements Second Conscription; Expected Total Conscription of 250,000 from the Province; Intensified Training for Special Ethnic Minority Recruits

Guangxi Correspondence: After the Lugouqiao Incident, the Central Government ordered national mobilization, and various provinces successively held conscriptions. At that time, Guangxi Province conducted its first conscription, recruiting 20 able-bodied men from each village and street, using a lottery system based on the lottery order to draft men into the army. According to surveys, Guangxi has a total population of over 13 million, with over 2.6 million men of conscription age. There are a total of over 24,600 villages and streets throughout the province. Based on the calculation of drafting 20 men from each village and street, approximately 500,000 men were conscripted. During the first phase of the War of Resistance, 380,000 of these 500,000 men were transferred north to participate in the various battlefields in the east, west, and north, while 120,000 remained stationed in the rear for training. After the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, the Central Supreme Military Headquarters re-adjusted the battlefields on all fronts and launched the second phase of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the military and political authorities of Guangxi Province also held the second major conscription. The Guangxi Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government have finalized all conscription procedures and ordered the military districts, civilian regiment command areas, and county magistrates to comply with them, starting implementation on July 1st. It is reported that the conscription methods for the second phase are slightly more lenient than the previous one: (1) The method of hiring substitutes is allowed. If a drafted man has special occupational needs, verified as true by the local township head and reviewed by the county government, the drafted man may be temporarily exempted from service and allowed to hire a substitute from the same township. (2) Civil servants currently in service are still allowed to pay a commutation fee in accordance with the commutation method. It is also reported that Guangxi Province will temporarily set the number of recruits for each village and street in this second phase at ten, totaling 250,000 men for the entire province. Combined with those conscripted in the first phase, approximately 750,000 men will be conscripted. According to a certain military expert, Guangxi has been preparing for rural autonomy for several years, and the organization of villages has a solid foundation, so the conscription work is not only orderly but also exceptionally rapid. Moreover, Guangxi Province is located in the remote western border of China, with its northwest connected to Guizhou Province. The area is characterized by towering mountains, dense forests, and lush mountains, and has traditionally been inhabited by special ethnic groups such as the Miao and Yao. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Guangxi authorities have paid close attention to the training of special ethnic groups. The Department of Civil Affairs has successively dispatched personnel to investigate various border counties, totaling eight special ethnic groups within the province: Yao, Miao, Dong, Liao, Nong, Luo, Ling, and Zhuang. From Liuzhou above Chang'an to the border of Guizhou, the Miao and Zhuang people are the most numerous. The areas around Qingyuan, Huaiyuan, Laibin, Nandan, and Hechi are mainly populated by the Dong, Liao, and Nong ethnic groups. The area upstream from Baise and Sicheng to Xilin and Xilong is mainly populated by the Luo and Ling ethnic groups. The area around Guiping, Wuxuan, Pingnan, Mengshan, and Lipu is purely populated by the Yao ethnic group. The above eight ethnic groups have a total population of over 300,000, distributed in over 60 counties throughout the province, residing in deep mountains and remote valleys. The cultural level of the above ethnic groups is relatively low, but they are known for their strong folk customs, diligence, endurance, and bravery in battle. The authorities, recognizing the usability of the ethnic spirit of these groups, are conducting special education for all ethnic groups while recruiting them for military training, preparing to draft them into the army. Regarding the former, the provincial government has allocated a special fund of 14,000 national currency yuan annually, establishing a total of 36 township central national basic schools and 611 village national basic schools according to the number of households in their villages, sending graduates from special teacher training institutes as teachers. Regarding the latter, each civil regiment command area has established special training centers to select recruits from various ethnic groups for military training. After graduating in three months, they will be organized into reserve teams to be drafted into the army when necessary. It is reported that the training of recruits from special ethnic groups will produce tens of thousands of skilled and brave soldiers in the future, and this group is best at climbing mountains, which is very suitable for mountain warfare in Guangxi.

### Zheng Zhaojing Arrives in Jiangsu Province; Decides to Establish Flood Control and Yellow River Disaster Relief Associations; Requests the Central Government to Allocate 300,000 Yuan for Dredging

Xinghua Correspondence: The Central Government attaches great importance to the prevention of floods and water conservancy taxes in northern Jiangsu. Previously, it specially dispatched Director Zheng Zhaojing of the Water Conservancy Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to Jiangsu to assist the local authorities in northern Jiangsu in expediting water conservancy projects. Recently, this work is planned to be actively carried out. A few days ago, Director Zheng and Han Zishi, a respected elder of Jiangsu Province, jointly came to northern Jiangsu again to discuss important matters related to water conservancy in northern Jiangsu. It is reported that a concrete solution has been reached. It is understood that the discussions have decided to organize a Flood Control Committee and a Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, each responsible for promoting the two major tasks of flood prevention and Yellow River disaster relief. Chairman Han will concurrently serve as the Director of the Flood Control Committee, and Han Zishi will serve as the Director of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee. Other staff members will mostly be concurrently appointed by personnel from relevant agencies. The main tasks of the two committees are to expedite the construction of embankments along the canal, intensify flood prevention, and use work-for-relief in the Lixiahe area to start dredging the waterways to the sea. The 300,000 yuan needed for the two committees will be requested from the Central Government, with local contributions. The two committees are about to be established to adjust water conservancy in northern Jiangsu, prevent Yellow River floods, and provide relief to disaster victims, which will greatly benefit the people of northern Jiangsu.

### Repairing Embankments; Completion Required Before Major Floods

Taixian Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has issued a special telegram to the county magistrates of various counties regarding the repair of embankments to prevent floods, strictly ordering compliance. The telegram stated that it has been ordered to repair the embankment projects. Some counties have earnestly implemented it, but there are also many cases where it is treated as a mere formality and the responsibility is shirked. Now that the flood season is approaching, and the Yellow River and Huai River are prone to surges, this important task is even more urgent. In addition to separate telegrams, we are issuing another telegram to urge the county magistrates to comply and transfer the orders to the township heads, strictly limiting the construction date and ordering the construction of earthen embankments around the original village foundations in each village to prevent floods. Those who have difficulty obtaining soil may build embankments separately as a place to avoid floods. All tasks must be completed before the flood season, and this project will be used as an assessment of the county magistrate's performance, which must be complied with and reported.

### Dinghai Liuheng Island; Japanese Troops Land; Garrison Resisting Firmly

Ningbo Correspondence: Liuheng Island in the southwest of Dinghai is one of the Zhoushan Islands. On the morning of the 7th, five Japanese warships sailed in.

After firing, three of the Japanese warships left, while the remaining two remained in place. On the afternoon of the 8th, another warship arrived, totaling three warships. At around 4:00 PM, they lowered steam boats, carrying over 200 soldiers, and under the cover of two Japanese aircraft and the shelling of Japanese warships, forcibly landed. The Liuheng garrison heroically resisted, and fierce fighting broke out. As of the time of writing, the fighting is still ongoing.

After a short stay in Kunming, he will go to Chongqing, and then he will still strive to relieve Chinese refugees with his original intention and bring doctors and a large amount of medicine to the inland to engage in relief work.

### Manchuria Is a Heavy Burden for Japan (Continued)

â Bo Ming

Warlords Seize Railways

But the Japanese warlords, attempting to gain the aid of the Western Conservative Party, were too eager, rashly antagonizing the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union then used the declarations of the Japanese warlords to start anti-Japanese propaganda, as if there was some major significance to it. The Japanese warlords claimed to be the "barrier against the Red menace," and the Soviet Union accepted this pretext, taking advantage of it to say that the Japanese warlords were the "spearhead of anti-Soviet imperialism." In the eyes of those who truly directed and controlled this policy and propaganda on both sides, it was a simulated war. The Japanese warlords tried to gain the sympathy and aid of the Western Conservative Party, while the Soviet Union used the Comintern to try to gain the support of the Western Liberal Party, pacifists, and laborers. But many Japanese and Soviet people, even among officials, earnestly engaged in the propaganda "war," and the attempt of the Japanese warlords to curry favor with the Western Conservative Party in this way naturally aroused animosity in all circles of the Soviet Union.

Something more important than this was the attempt of the Kwantung Army to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1933, and they made no greater mistake than this. In 1929, the Soviets had expressed that they would not allow the Chinese side to seize their valuable and profitable railway lines, but in 1933, the Japanese warlords in Manchuria began to arrest Soviet railway personnel and obstruct their management of railway money, intending to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, just like the methods used by the Chinese side five years earlier. As this process progressed smoothly, in October 1933, the Soviet government made a strong and ineffective negotiation with Tokyo, but as the Soviet Union could not obtain satisfaction from the Japanese warlords or Tokyo, it published formal and secret documents between the Japanese army and the civilian officials of "Manchukuo," disclosing the entire plan. These documents were obtained from competent espionage work. The Japanese warlords were not only startled by the sudden display of determination by the Soviet Union, but also shocked that Moscow knew every action of the Japanese side, and immediately stopped their process, finally agreeing to purchase the railway from the Soviet Union. But this foolish conspiracy was one of the most important factors causing friction between the Japanese and Soviet governments, and from that time on, the Soviet government openly used its power to obstruct the Japanese warlords in China, which was Japan's most costly error.

The deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations resulted in the Soviet Union building large-scale defensive works on the border. The Japanese warlords therefore not only retained some sympathy and support from Western conservatives, but also continued to expand their armaments on the pretext of the "Soviet threat," constantly requesting huge sums of money from their country to fill the funds. However, even before that, the cost of Manchuria had been constantly increasing. The Japanese warlords and their agents, in order to gain public support for their adventurous actions in Manchuria, falsely claimed that this move could alleviate Japan's economic difficulties. Only the ignorant and easily deceived would believe this, because Japan's heaviest economic burden was those warlords themselves, plus the national debt issued for their previous adventures and other constant expenses. But the warlords' promises were soon proven false by their own statements. Less than two years after the occupation of Manchuria, the warlords began to explain that alleviating economic difficulties was not a current matter, but would eventually be realized one day. Unfortunately, the so-called "one day in the future" required Japanese funds to be invested," and the future gains from this "investment" were immeasurable. The promises became more and more distant, while the increase in expenses increased year by year. The amount of government bonds issued by the government increased day by day, and Japan's government banks and other investors were ordered by the government to engage in "investment" in Manchuria together.

Huge Manchurian Expenditures

In 1933, Japan's official military expenditure in Manchuria was 162 million yen, all from the pockets of Japanese taxpayers. In 1936, this expenditure increased to more than 183 million yen and was still increasing. The expenses for laying strategic railways (the warlords told Japanese investors that these railways would "develop the area" and generate interest) and purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway averaged more than 200 million yen per year until 1936. The South Manchuria Railway issued new bonds every year, including expenses for many businesses other than railways. The direct investment of the South Manchuria Railway amounted to more than 800 million yen by the end of March 1936, of which railways accounted for 305 million yen, coal mines accounted for 120 million yen, and ports accounted for 100 million yen. However, although the South Manchuria Railway seized the Chinese railways in Manchuria and controlled their "management," the profits did not increase as much as the "investment." In fact, the profits of the South Manchuria Railway fell from 61 million yen in 1932-33 to 43 million yen in the final year and had not recovered to 50 million yen in 1935-36 (calculated in devalued yen).

In reality, there were many railway lines that were unprofitable even before the occupation, because some railways, both Chinese and Japanese, were laid for strategic or competitive purposes, not directly for economic purposes. But the Japanese "military economists" expanded the unprofitable development to other aspects of "investment." The low-quality iron in Manchuria could only result in losses if operated, because foreign iron prices were much cheaper than Manchurian iron. However, the warlords built steel plants and spent huge sums of money to engage in steelmaking, and engaged in oil extraction, which cost much more than imported oil. In order to seek economic utilization of this Manchurian oil, the warlords had to establish an oil monopoly and prevent foreign competition. The economic goal of the warlords was to increase the production of military supplies within their own sphere of influence, instead of buying them overseas at lower prices. This was the goal of Manchuria's "economic development." The expenses were all paid by Japanese taxpayers, and part of them would be passed on to their children, making the burden even harder to bear.

In 1930, the pig iron production was 290,000 tons in Anshan and 85,000 tons in Benxihu. By 1935, the former had almost increased to 412,000 tons, and the latter had increased even more. Compared with the price of foreign iron, each ton of pig iron was at least 10 yuan cheaper. In particular, the Showa Steel Works in Anshan, which was established with a capital of 100 million yen, can be said to be consuming Japanese taxpayers' money for military purposes in a more thorough way, with no possible hope of profit. The first factory was opened in May 1935 and has been expanded, and steel production has gradually increased. Because the iron sand is of poor quality, even though the wages of Chinese workers are low, it is still losing money.

Warlord Promises Are False

In the early years of the invasion, the Japanese warlords told Japanese workers that Manchuria would not become a place for capitalists to develop, but would be controlled by the military for the benefit of the entire Japanese people, giving Japanese people great opportunities to get jobs and engage in colonization. Of course, this promise was as false as the promise made to investors. The new railways and new industries established or expanded by the warlords only used a limited number of Japanese people as technicians, managers, or a few special grades of employees, but the vast majority of workers were Chinese, because their wages were less than half of what Japanese workers earned in their own country. In order to save money in these unprofitable businesses, they had to hire Chinese workers with extremely low wages, living almost half human standard lives.

Not only did Japanese workers rarely get employment opportunities in Manchuria, but they also encountered competition from Chinese workers in Manchuria in their own country. In addition to the warlords' large enterprises, there were also textile and other businesses established by Japanese capitalists in Manchuria for profit, because they could only make a profit because Chinese workers' wages were lower than Japanese workers' wages. Therefore, Japanese domestic industries encountered direct competition from industries established in Manchuria, so that workers in Japanese industries had to compete with Chinese workers. Although Japanese exports increased greatly in 1931-32 and subsequent years because the yen was devalued, the overall development in these years has made Japanese workers more difficult.

Reasons for Industrial Losses

One reason why the warlords could not make Manchuria profitable was because the situation was far beyond their control. Soybeans, which were originally the basis for "Manchurian prosperity," the basis for Fengtian personnel becoming rich and greatly increasing the army, its export industry has fallen miserably. If the Japanese warlords had a little knowledge of world economic development, they would have known that this export product was declining and would inevitably continue to decline. In fact, in 1931, careful observers had clearly seen this sign in the world market and in Japan itself. The foreign trade figures of Manchuria can prove that the Japanese warlords have been greatly disappointed in this regard. What they have seized is not an increasingly profitable economy, but an increasingly declining economy. It is true that they have seized Zhang Xueliang's large arsenal, airplanes, railways, banks, etc., as well as his huge private property, but these huge resources have gradually dried up. Manchuria's economy is not only empty, but it is indeed deteriorating.

For many years, both China and Japan had huge trade deficits, with very few years of trade surplus. However, Manchuria was significantly opposite to other parts of China. For many years, the exports of this vast region were more than the imports. Manchuria's exports increased from less than 45 million yuan in 1908 to almost 500 million yuan in 1929, and this did not include the amount transported from Manchuria to other parts of China, which was also very important. Manchuria's most important export was soybeans and soybean products, which were transported to Western countries, Japan, and other parts of China. Manchuria was the only region in East Asia with a large surplus of exports and a trade surplus. Soybeans not only greatly increased the private property and military power of the Fengtian rulers, but also the Chinese who migrated from Shandong Province further south, especially to Fengtian, relied on them for their livelihood.

Decline of Soybean Market

The export of soybeans and soybean products once reached 300 million yuan annually, accounting for 23% of China's total exports, and this special export almost entirely came from Manchuria. It could be used for food and industry, and Japan was its most important market. More importantly, soybean cake was used as fertilizer for Japanese farmland to supplement the lack of human and animal fertilizer. However, since the discovery of chemical fertilizers cheaper than soybean cake ten years ago, Japan has built more and more factories to manufacture them, and its purchase of Manchurian soybean cake has been decreasing. At the same time, Western countries have also been growing more soybeans in their own countries. Since 1927, Japan's purchases of Manchurian soybean cake (Japan was the most important buyer) have been sharply reduced, and its exports have been drastically reduced. Soybean oil exports reached a peak in 1927 and have since declined. In the years when silver prices fell, soybean exports did not improve because Chinese goods were extremely cheap. It was not until 1929 that it reached its peak, and then it began to decline again. Although soybean prices reached an unprecedented low, sales remained sluggish due to the economic recession in the West.

This was the situation when the Japanese warlords invaded Manchuria. They were completely unaware of the commercial trends concerning China, the world, and even Japan itself. The war in Manchuria disrupted transportation and lost general security, making things even worse.

Until 1932, Manchuria had a large trade surplus with foreign countries and other parts of China. Despite the global economic crisis, Manchuria's exports to foreign countries in 1930 still reached more than 430 million Chinese dollars, which was 100 million dollars more than imports. The total amount of Manchuria's exports to foreign countries and China combined was almost 600 million Chinese dollars, while imports were less than 460 million yuan. According to careful economists, the actual trade volume was much larger, because the Chinese customs did not revise the figures according to the annual price changes, so its statistics often underestimated the discounted value of exports. Therefore, the actual value of Manchuria's exports in 1930 was about 880 million yuan.

However, after Manchuria was occupied, there was a big change. The trade figures for 1931 showed that Manchuria's exports were worth a total of 739 million Manchurian dollars (equivalent to Chinese dollars), imports were 344 million yuan, and the trade surplus reached 395 million yuan. The figures for 1932 showed that exports were worth a total of 616 million Manchurian dollars, imports were 310 million yuan, and the trade surplus had decreased to 315 million yuan. In 1933, exports had decreased to 424 million Manchurian dollars, but imports had jumped to 516 million yuan, completely changing from a trade surplus to a trade deficit. The trade deficit in 1933 was 92 million yuan, and it increased to 145 million yuan in 1934. Since then, the trend of trade deficit has continued. Manchuria is no longer a region with a trade surplus, but one with a rapidly increasing trade deficit. Now it does not generate any profit and is no longer enough to cover expenses, so it has to increase taxes on the Japanese people today and issue government bonds tomorrow to make up for the shortfall (to be continued)

### The Concession Authorities Readjust the New Price Limit for Rice, Effective Tomorrow: White Rice at 20 Yuan, Native Rice at 16 Yuan

Since the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market was subjected to price limits and a crackdown on speculation by the concession authorities, speculators have ceased their manipulations, stockpilers have released their hoards, and the new rice harvest is approaching. As a result, market prices have plummeted. After discussions with rice industry groups, the concession authorities have readjusted the price limits, effective tomorrow. Details are as follows:

New Rice Arrival Imminent

Shanghai's rice supply traditionally comes from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The new rice harvests from these regions are about to begin. New japonica rice from Xiaodong is expected in early August, while "Sheep Point" rice from Jiaxing and native indica rice from Wuhu are expected in mid-August. Simultaneously, due to favorable weather conditions, a bountiful harvest is anticipated. Consequently, stored rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is being shipped to Shanghai for sale. This has resulted in no decrease in the amount of domestic rice shipped to Shanghai, even during the lean season. Rice speculators, wary of the strict crackdown by the concession authorities, have also ceased their market manipulations. Stockpilers are also releasing their hoards due to the hot weather, which can easily spoil stored rice. As a result, the market is experiencing an oversupply, leading to a sharp decline in prices.

New Price Limits Set

Regarding rice prices, the Public Concession and French Concession authorities, along with representatives from various rice industry groups in the city, have decided that, starting from the 17th of this month, the maximum market price for both wholesale and retail white japonica rice shall not exceed 20 yuan per stone (unit of weight), and the maximum price for native indica rice shall not exceed 16 yuan per stone. Price reductions should be implemented uniformly. Transactions exceeding these price limits will not be recognized as valid. Such cases should be reported to the police for investigation and enforcement. The above regulations will be posted at the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association market tomorrow (the 17th) morning, notifying all rice merchants to comply.

Food Supply Secure

According to information obtained by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday from rice industry groups, the rice reserves within the Shanghai concessions, as reported in the fifteenth report on July 10th, amounted to 344,902 bags. Although this is a decrease of 55,000 bags compared to the previous period, it is sufficient to supply Shanghai's citizens for one to two months. Furthermore, stored rice from producing areas is being actively shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, there is no concern about a shortage of food for Shanghai's residents. Yesterday, two to three shipments arrived via the river from Nantong, and 2,400 bags of wheel-transported goods arrived from Changzhou and Tongli. It is rumored that a large quantity of stored rice from producing areas will be shipped to Shanghai for sale within the next week. However, market transactions remain sluggish.

Further Reductions Expected

Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang, members of the Bean and Rice Industry Association Committee, Fu Qiangeng, Market Management Committee member, and Zhang Nianxuan, Chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, met with Mr. Ho Te-kui, Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, on the 13th of this month to discuss stabilizing rice prices and maintaining the food supply. It was decided to lower the previous price limit by one yuan, effective the 17th of this month. It is rumored that if the supply can be increased further, prices will be gradually reduced again. The market is closed for the weekly holiday today. When it reopens tomorrow, transactions will be conducted in accordance with the new price limits. The Bean and Rice Industry Association has scheduled a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees for 3:00 PM tomorrow to report on the new price limits.

### List Provided by Japanese Authorities Leads to Consecutive Searches in Concessions; Nothing Found in Public Concession, Firearms Confiscated and Woman Arrested in French Concession

The Continental Daily reports that detectives from the Criminal Section of the Public Concession Police Department, based on information provided by the Japanese military authorities and in response to their request, conducted a large-scale consecutive search yesterday evening (the 14th) in hopes of capturing guerrilla leaders believed to be hiding in various parts of the Public Concession.

Nothing Found

The search team left headquarters at approximately 5:00 PM and worked for over two hours. Detectives searched all locations listed on the list provided by the Japanese authorities. However, according to information received last night, the search yielded no results. A total of eight locations were searched within the two hours, but no guerrillas or suspected guerrillas were apprehended. It is rumored that detectives will resume searching other locations at dawn today (the 15th), but this information could not be confirmed last night. Police personnel are maintaining silence regarding the search. However, reliable sources indicate that no one listed on the Japanese authorities' list provided to the Public Concession authorities was found in any of the searched locations.

Firearms Confiscated

At 4:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese Special Service Department dispatched more than ten Japanese officials, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives from the Criminal Section of the Public Concession Police, in automobiles to the French Police Department. They claimed to have discovered dangerous goods and certain suspicious materials at 17, Lane 316, Fuli Road, requesting assistance in investigating and arresting the occupants. The Western Detective Chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the address for a search, which resulted in the confiscation of eleven "box cannon" pistols and ten handguns, all of which were new models. A Guangdong woman named Chen Xiuzhen, aged 25, was also apprehended. No men were found on the premises. Chen and the confiscated firearms were taken to the French Police Department for temporary detention pending investigation and handling. Furthermore, The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the French Concession Police Department, at the request of the Japanese Military Police, conducted consecutive night searches, but the details remain unclear. Reports that 21 handguns (including 11 military "box cannon" pistols) were confiscated could not be confirmed as of this morning (the 15th). The French Concession Police Department stated that no fewer than fifteen separate searches were conducted overnight. No documents were seized, and no arrests were made. The search concluded at dawn today.

### Importers Cancel Indian Cotton Orders; Increased Foreign Exchange Controls and Deposit Restrictions Lead to Sharp Reduction in Foreign Exchange Needs for Importers; Coastal Inter-Provincial Trade Increases Sharply

Shanghai's soaring import surplus has led to a corresponding increase in the demand for black market foreign exchange. In light of this, the government authorities, in addition to having the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund adjust the black market exchange rate and instructing foreign banks to maintain the six-and-a-half-penny exchange rate, have now strengthened foreign exchange controls and restricted deposits. This move has proven effective in balancing trade and stabilizing foreign exchange management. In the future, importers' demand for foreign exchange is expected to decrease. It is rumored that numerous orders for Indian cotton have been canceled, and future transactions will be significantly reduced.

Astounding Quantities of Cotton and Wheat Imports

Jianghai Customs' exports for January of this year amounted to over 30 million yuan. However, there has been no progress in subsequent months, while imports have steadily increased. Imports for January were 39 million yuan, and for May, they reached 72 million yuan, nearly doubling. The main causes of the surge in imports and the trade deficit are the large quantities of cotton, foreign wheat, and other goods being imported. Cotton imports over the past five months have totaled over 59 million yuan, exceeding the same period last year by more than six times. Wheat and tobacco have also been imported in large quantities. Imports for the first five months of the year totaled 17.654 million yuan, while tobacco imports totaled 17.4271 million yuan, exceeding the same period last year by over 7 million yuan.

Strengthening Anti-Smuggling Efforts in the Interior

Since the outbreak of war, the National Government has been preventing smuggled goods from entering the country and harming national tax revenues. In addition to establishing anti-smuggling offices along the coast and conducting strict inspections, the government has also encouraged citizens to report smuggling activities. Through the cooperation of the government and the people, smuggled goods have been virtually eliminated in the interior. Recently, with the coastal ports of Shantou and Dinghai occupied by the Japanese military, the government has issued a general order to all provincial governments to instruct all counties to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts in the interior, establish anti-smuggling offices, strictly prohibit the import of smuggled goods, promote the sale of local goods, and increase tax revenues to benefit the war effort.

Flexible Transfer of Coastal Specialties

Although the situation in the coastal provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong has been tense recently, there is no cause for concern, as the authorities have taken strict precautions. Inter-provincial trade among the provinces remains very active, facilitating the exchange of goods and resources. In terms of transportation, all highways remain open as usual. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway terminates at Xixiang in Jiangxi Province and at Xiaoshan in Zhejiang Province. Passenger and freight transport are also operating as usual. Since the implementation of the six-province joint transportation system involving Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi, the accumulation of special products in various provinces has been alleviated. The Central Trade Commission purchases most of these products and selects them for export. As a result, the rural economy has become more flexible, and the people are reassured.

### Meat Prices Rise Again; Inland Areas Prohibit Transport; Puppet Market Monopolizes

Since the establishment of the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou, fresh pork has been under control. Now, at various ports of origin, the Japanese military is forcibly registering and controlling the transportation of fresh pork. As a result, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered all guerrilla areas in northern Jiangsu to prohibit local pork vendors from transporting fresh pork to the "Livestock Market" offices at various ports. Violators will have their barges burned and those responsible will be severely punished. This has caused another panic in the local fresh meat market. On the 13th, only 100 head of fresh pork arrived. On the 14th, none arrived at all. As a result, the market was out of stock yesterday, and all meat shops had no meat to sell. A few meat shops went to western Shanghai to buy local pork to meet the market demand, but demand exceeded supply, and prices rose to 1.20 yuan per pound.

### Bank of China Prepares to Pay Maturing Principal and Interest on Consolidated Bonds; Discount Certificates and Installment Payment Schedules Printed; Payment Methods for Reconstructed Gold Loan Principal and Interest Also Determined

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has requested the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China to discount the seventh principal and interest payment on five types of Consolidated Bonds (Types A, B, C, D, and E). After payments are made by the four banks at the end of July, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China about the payment method for the maturing principal and interest on the Consolidated Bonds. Although no official order has been received from the Ministry of Finance, it has been confirmed that discounting payments is a fact. Shanghai will make payments in six installments. Therefore, the bank has begun preparations, and the discount certificates and installment payment schedules have been sent to the printer. Furthermore, it is rumored that the Ministry of Finance has also determined the payment methods for the seventh principal and interest payment on the Reconstructed Public Gold Loan maturing at the end of August, and the twelfth principal and interest payment on the Gold and Long Bonds maturing at the end of September. All three types of bonds are guaranteed by customs revenues. Although customs revenues in the occupied areas of Chongqing have been seized, the government has specifically requested the four banks to discount the payments, demonstrating the government's consistent policy of maintaining creditworthiness. Bondholders generally consider the government's measures appropriate. Yesterday, Consolidated Bonds (Types A, B, C, D, and E) fell in the Shanghai grey market. The reason for this decline was the easing of forward exchange rates. The closing prices for yesterday are recorded as follows: Type A at 58.85 yuan, down 1 yuan; Type B at 49.75 yuan, down 0.60 yuan; Type C at 48.35 yuan, down 0.45 yuan; Type D at 47.55 yuan, down 0.50 yuan; and Type E at 48 yuan, down 0.50 yuan.

### Japanese Troops Ambushed in Sanguantang, South of Pudong; Guerrilla Fighters Sacrificed Valiantly; Puppet Troops in Caojing Also Defect

After over one hundred puppet troops in Pudong defected with their weapons and joined the guerrilla forces, the Japanese military dispatched a large contingent to the Pudong area for so-called "mopping-up" operations in an attempt to retaliate. As a result, Pudong has been engulfed in flames. According to information obtained from merchants coming to Shanghai from Pudong, the battle of Sanguantang was the most intense. Several hundred troops from the Japanese Nanshan Unit passed through Shenhang and "searched" the town of Sanguantang. At that time, the local guerrilla forces had already received intelligence and ambushed the Japanese troops at Xiejiazhai and Zhangjiazhai, key points on their route, while also deploying troops to the east, west, north, and south to lay an ambush. When the Japanese troops passed through the area, the ambushing forces launched a coordinated attack. Caught off guard, the Japanese troops engaged in a hasty battle. After two hours of fierce fighting, the two sides engaged in close-quarters combat due to the close proximity. As a result, the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated, suffering significant casualties and abandoning over twenty rifles and four machine guns. Guerrilla fighters also sacrificed valiantly. It is also rumored that the entire "Self-Defense Corps" of western Shanghai in the No. 2 Prison in Caohejing, western Shanghai, defected the day before yesterday. Fighting is now occurring in various locations along the Shanghai-Minhang Road.

### New Remittance System Convenient and Efficient; Banks and Firms Devise Internal Procedures for Minor Matters

Since receiving orders from the Ministry to implement centralized clearing of instruments, banks and money firms have held separate meetings to discuss difficulties and exchange opinions. Internal procedures for minor matters are being handled by each bank and firm. The new remittance system has been in operation since the 4th of this month, and the banks and money firms find the centralized method to be convenient and efficient. Previously, banks processed money firm instruments through the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Money firms handled bank instruments in the same way. Now that banks and money firms have established separate joint clearinghouses, all instruments held by banks and money firms are authorized to the respective clearinghouses, which are responsible for handling the entire process. Regardless of the number of transactions, accounting methods are used, and balances are cleared the following day, eliminating the previous cumbersome procedures. Rumors that unscrupulous individuals are using "China Prosperity Bank" banknotes to exchange for legal tender, and then using the legal tender to buy Hong Kong dollars for the purpose of buying foreign exchange, are rare in Shanghai and would result in significant losses.

### Japanese Ships Resume Shanghai-Bound Routes; Merchants Unwilling to Board; Baiwumaru and Yangtze River to Sail on the 18th; Moufu Postpones Sailing to Ningbo, Deping Returns to Shanghai Today or Tomorrow

Since Dinghai fell, the Shanghai-Dinghai route has been suspended. The Japanese side has now dispatched the Baiwumaru and the Sino-Japanese jointly operated Yangtze River to resume service on the 18th. However, people from Dinghai are unwilling to board, and there is no freight traffic. Regarding the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the Moufu arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. Due to boiler maintenance, it is scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the morning of the 18th, and arrangements have been made for the transfer of passengers and baggage. The Deping is scheduled to return to Shanghai this morning. Details are as follows:

Japanese Side Dispatches Ships to Resume Service to Dinghai

Since the Japanese military landed in Shenjiamen and Dinghai on the 23rd of last month, transportation between Shanghai and Dinghai and Ningbo and Dinghai has been disrupted for a month. It is now learned that the Japanese side has enlisted several Chinese to form the "Daxing Company" and purchased the Japanese ship Baiwumaru, which is scheduled to resume service to Dinghai, as well as Wanshan and Shenjiamen, on the 18th. In addition, the Chinese Hainan Shipping Company has also cooperated with the Japanese side to purchase the Japanese ship Yangtze River, which is also scheduled to sail on the same day. Both ships fly the Japanese flag, and most of the shipowners and staff are Japanese. However, people from Dinghai, grieving over the occupation and devastation of their hometown, are unwilling to board Japanese ships, and general passengers are also unwilling to load cargo.

Moufu Repairs Postpone Sailing to Ningbo

After the German Lixiang Foreign Firm's Moufu was approved to resume service on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, it returned to Shanghai from Ningbo the day before yesterday (the 14th) afternoon. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo again this morning. However, due to boiler maintenance, the departure has been postponed to the morning of the 18th. The Italian ship Deping has completed unloading passengers and cargo outside Zhenhai Harbor and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow.

Arrangements for Transfer of Passengers and Baggage

Because the Lixiang Foreign Firm's Moufu is docked outside Zhenhai Harbor, passengers and cargo must be transferred by small boats. Therefore, specific arrangements for the transfer of passengers and baggage have been made as follows: (1) The valid route for passenger tickets sold by the Moufu is temporarily from the Shanghai wharf to the Zhenhai County wharf. (2) The cost of the barge from the ship to the Zhenhai wharf is included in the passenger ticket. (3) The cost of the boat from the Zhenhai transfer port is the responsibility of the passenger. (4) Passengers' baggage, except for small carry-on items, must first be handed over to the ship's baggage room for transportation to Ningbo or Zhenhai, and a transportation fee of 50 cents in national currency will be charged per item, along with a baggage ticket. Passengers can use the ticket to claim their baggage at Ningbo or Zhenhai. (5) Passengers are not allowed to bring any items on board other than essential travel items such as suitcases, trunks, and baskets. (6) When transferring to the barge outside Zhenhai Harbor, passengers must follow the instructions printed on the back of the barge boarding pass issued by the ship, boarding in order according to the number on the pass and refraining from rushing to avoid danger. (7) The above-mentioned barge boarding pass will be issued when tickets are collected on the ship.

### Reports of Mishap are Misinformation; Pan Gongzhan Safe in Chongqing; Confusion Caused by Inverted Telegram; Actually a Telegram Reporting Safety

Yesterday, some newspapers in this city reported that Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and his family were killed when Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing on the 10th. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with his fellow townsmen yesterday and confirmed that the above news was false. It was reported that a gentleman in this city received a telegram from Chongqing on the 6th on the 10th. At the time, there was concern because of the inverted meaning of the telegram. After checking with the telegraph office, the original telegram read, "Chongqing bombed again, Brother Zhan's family and brother are safe." It was entirely a telegram reporting safety, and there was no bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft on the 10th of this month, which can also prove the inaccuracy of the above news.

### Subei Chinese Army Counterattacks; Fierce Naval Battle; Chinese Army Counterattacks Starting on the 11th; Naval Forces Sink Japanese Boat

According to shipping industry sources, the Subei Chinese Army launched a counteroffensive on the 11th. Ships have stopped in various ports. The situations are as follows:

Counterattacks in Various Locations

Starting on the 11th of this month, the Subei Chinese Army Command transferred a select force from a certain location to Jiangyin, Nantong, Haimen, Chongming, and other locations to join the guerrilla forces. They were equipped and began counterattacking the Japanese military. Fierce fighting occurred. The Chinese army was powerful and unpredictable, and the Japanese military suffered heavy casualties.

Sinking Japanese Boat

According to shipping industry sources, the newly trained naval guerrilla 1st Column of the Chinese army has sufficient strength and numerous armed sailboats. On the morning of the 12th, while patrolling the waters of Xiaoniu Harbor, they encountered a Japanese motorboat and engaged in a naval battle. They exchanged fire with machine guns and small cannons. The Chinese army was accurate and sank two motorboats, drowning more than 20 Japanese soldiers.

Ships Stop in Various Bays

The local situation is extremely chaotic, and puppet troops and bandits are taking advantage of the situation to create disturbances, looting along the way, causing merchants to hesitate, and obstructing freight transportation, affecting shipping. Ships traveling to Zhangjiagang, Tianshenggang, Songjigang, Miaotougang, and other ports have temporarily stopped in bays to avoid danger and will resume service after the situation has calmed down.

### Wusong Ferry Service Suspended

The ferry service from the concession to Wusong, which had recently resumed, was again blocked and suspended starting on the 15th. It is reported that rumors have been rampant in the Wusong area in recent days, and security is tight. Japanese troops have been searching residences daily. To prevent accidents, residents have been staying indoors. The ferry across the river from Gaoqiao to Wusong is still operating as usual. However, security at the ferry is very tight, and all passengers are subject to strict inspection.

### Feng Mingzheng, Manager of the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, Arrested Yesterday; Arrested Due to Misunderstanding Regarding Worker Incident; Transferred to Japanese Authorities for Interrogation; Will Be Released if No Other Reasons Exist

At 10:30 AM yesterday, Feng Mingzheng, manager of the local Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, was suddenly requested by Japanese personnel to be detained by the Central Police Department, who dispatched personnel to escort him to the police station. After a brief interrogation, someone requested that he be transferred to the Japanese authorities for interrogation. The details are as follows:

Injured Worker Suspected of Gunshot Wound

It is reported that a worker named Du, who previously worked at the factory, claimed to have been accidentally injured in the arm by machinery while working at the factory last month. He was sent to Fukumin Hospital in Hongkou for treatment. After staying for three weeks, he recovered fully and was discharged from the hospital. Subsequently, the Japanese side suddenly suspected that the injured worker had suffered a gunshot wound. Japanese military police personnel immediately dispatched personnel to the Central Police Department to request assistance in detaining and interrogating him.

Detention of Du and Others Yields No Results

At approximately 10:00 AM yesterday, in response to a request from Japanese personnel, personnel from both sides met and traveled in three cars to the distribution office of the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory on Yuchaqing Road, intending to inquire about the injured and recovered worker, Du, in order to clarify the situation. The factory informed them that Du was not at the factory. The detectives gathered, with one car parked at the Far Eastern Hotel, one at the Continental Hotel, and one at the factory entrance. Nearby residents were extremely concerned and watched with suspicion.

Manager Arrested and Handed Over to Japanese Side

Subsequently, the factory truthfully stated that Du was not present. Japanese personnel then arrested the factory manager, Feng Mingzheng (from Hangzhou). The three cars immediately returned to the Central Police Department. After interrogation, the Japanese side requested permission to transfer Feng to the Japanese authorities for interrogation. It is understood that Feng's detention was due to a misunderstanding. It is expected that the Japanese side will return Feng to the Central Police Department next Wednesday. If there are no other reasons, he is expected to be released immediately.

### Japan Announces Military Actions in Swatow and Hinghwa; Third-Country Nationals and Ships Ordered to Withdraw; British and Americans Insist on Retaining All Rights

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the Japanese naval authorities warned third-country governments this morning (the 15th) that military actions would begin against Swatow, located on the northeastern coast of Daya Bay in Guangdong Province, at 8:00 AM on July 18th. The eastern part of the Xinghua Strait, leading to Putian in Fujian Province, would be blockaded the following morning. Third-country nationals and ships, including warships, were ordered to withdraw from the aforementioned coastal ports. The Japanese Navy would not be responsible for any direct or indirect losses suffered by third-country nationals and ships after the deadline. However, third-country governments insisted that the Japanese side should bear the responsibility. It is reported that a few foreign missionaries currently reside in Swatow, but there are no foreigners in Putian. Several months ago, foreign shipping was placed under Japanese control in eight ports, including Swatow. It is reported that the reaction of the British and Americans to the Japanese warning is the same as their reaction to previous Japanese demands for withdrawal, namely, that they will retain their rights in these and other towns. The Japanese side announced new military operations along the coast and claimed that obstructions and hazards would be placed at the entrances and exits of the above-mentioned two ports: (1) Swatow, west of the Shanyiao (transliteration) entrance, and (2) the Xinghua Strait, south of the Antarctic (transliteration) Strait. At the same time, the Japanese military actions against Tongshan and Zhaoan in Quanzhou are scheduled to begin at 7:00 AM this morning. It is generally believed that the Japanese Navy is currently engaged in blockading all exits to the sea in order to complete the blockade of the Chinese coast.

### Municipal Council Releases June Industrial Conditions Report; Silk and Cocoon Raw Material Shortage Worrying; Price Index Increases Again

According to the factory affairs division of the Municipal Council, the following is a summary of the factory situation in the city for June:

Establishment of New Factories

According to the division's report, although the number of requests to establish factories in the Western District in June was not as high as in October, the more notable ones included two factories producing lead oxide and lead acetate, two waste silk spinning mills, one wool and one cotton spinning mill each, one cannery, and two glass factories. Forty-six new factories were inspected after starting operations, with weaving factories being the most numerous. Some manufacturing plants have opened branch factories in the Eastern District because they cannot obtain raw materials elsewhere, including one each of hat factories, oxygen manufacturing plants, motorcycle assembly plants, soap factories, elastic band factories, and disinfectant cotton factories.

Silk Material Shortage

Due to transportation disruptions, few new cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai. The business prospects of the 46 new silk reeling factories that were established in the spring are concerning. In addition, due to the blockade of Zhejiang, all new cocoons from Zhejiang Province are difficult to ship to Shanghai, leaving only Jiangsu Province as a source, which is not enough to meet the demand. Therefore, once the silk factories have reeled all of their stored cocoons, they will be forced to reduce operations. Waste silk factories are also similarly affected. Several factories that use foreign raw materials have already reduced operations. It is claimed that recent financial measures may affect the ability of small factories to maintain their previous production capacity.

Worker Treatment

One weaving factory has implemented a half-hour rest period in the afternoon, during which workers can leave their work and the noise subsides, allowing workers to rest. The factory has installed 30 shower facilities that can be used free of charge at any time. The roof isolates the indoor temperature, reducing it by six degrees. At the same time, the workers' wages have been increased by 8%, retroactive to June 1st, and rice has been purchased and resold to workers at a price 4 yuan lower than the original price. Several other factories have adjusted wages according to the increase in the cost of living. One weaving factory has increased hourly wages by 12.5% and piecework wages by 13.5%, provided that the work is satisfactory. It has been tried to implement an eight-hour workday with the same productivity as a twelve-hour workday. Therefore, piecework wages have been increased to 20%.

### Dutch Envoy and Wife Travel East

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Bausenwein, and his wife have recently sailed to Japan for a short stay.

### Dramatic Increase in Chinese Tea Exports, Flourishing Foreign Firms, Strict Control Procedures by the Trade Commission, Tea Firms Earning Millions

Chinese tea sales abroad are now extremely prosperous. The tea firms of various foreign companies in this port are experiencing a dramatic increase in business. The future is very optimistic. The reporters from Daguang News Agency investigated and reported the situation as follows:

Overseas Sales Flourishing

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, fearing that the export of domestic specialties would be threatened by some party, formed the National Foreign Trade Commission to prepare for contingencies and maintain the overall export effort. Among China's export specialties, apart from silk, tung oil, and metals, tea is the most important. The responsible authorities, recognizing the importance of tea in foreign trade, immediately implemented strict controls. Production, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and other procedures are now much more carefully managed than before the war. As a result, the international market has a very positive impression of Chinese black and green tea. The quantity ordered by various foreign firms has broken past records. Most of the deliveries are in Hong Kong, with a small number in Shanghai.

Foreign Firms Profiting

Yesterday, according to inquiries made by Daguang News Agency reporters to foreign tea firms, these firms specialize in export trade. In the past, Chinese tea exports were purely ordered directly from tea firms by foreign firms stationed in Shanghai. Since the establishment of the Trade Commission, although the tea firms' business remains the same, exports have become indirect. Order and delivery procedures are now handled by the Trade Commission. The general office of the commission is currently located in Ningbo, with a branch office in Shanghai. As for the operating profits of various tea firms from last year to the present, many have earned several million dollars, with a minimum of several hundred thousand dollars. In Shanghai, the goods currently being sold are mostly from local firms. The amount of new black and green tea transported to Shanghai this year is very small, because Shanghai is an occupied area, and the Trade Commission's control is problematic.

### President Pierce Arrives in Shanghai Today, Departs for Los Angeles Tomorrow, President Coolidge Arrives on the 19th

The American President Lines' President Pierce, which departed from Los Angeles on June 19th and sailed to the Far East, arrived in Kobe on the 2nd of this month. The next day, it sailed directly from Kobe to Hong Kong and then to Little Luzon. It is now returning from the Philippines and passed through Hong Kong to Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is expected to enter the port at noon today and dock at buoys 11 and 12. The passenger tender will depart from the New Bund Wharf at 11:30 AM today, and passengers will return to the New Customs Wharf around 1:00 PM. The large ship will depart at 8:00 AM tomorrow, passing through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco, and return to Los Angeles. The last passenger tender will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 7:00 AM tomorrow morning. The company's President Coolidge, which departed from Los Angeles this time, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th. Due to a hurricane at sea a few days ago, the voyage was delayed. According to the company, it should arrive at 2:30 PM on the 19th and also dock at buoys 11 and 12. The passenger tender will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 2:30 PM that afternoon, and passengers will return to the New Customs Wharf around 4:00 PM. The large ship's departure will also be delayed by one day and changed to 10:00 AM on the 20th, heading to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. The last passenger tender will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 8:30 AM that morning. The British company's Chattellar (transliteration) is returning to Shanghai from Kobe, Japan, and is expected to arrive at the port at 11:00 AM today. It is scheduled to dock at buoys 12 and 13 and depart from Shanghai at 3:00 PM next Tuesday (the 18th) to return to London. The company's Sudan arrived in Dagu Port, Tianjin from Yokohama, Japan on the 7th of this month, loaded soybeans, and came to Shanghai to return to Europe. It was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 11th, but after arriving at Dagu Port, it encountered various difficulties from the Japanese side, preventing it from sailing on schedule. Now, after ten days, according to the company yesterday, the matter at Dagu Port has been completed, and it is scheduled to come to Shanghai today and arrive at the port around next Tuesday (the 18th). The departure from Shanghai has been rescheduled to the 20th to return to Europe.

### British Side Unlikely to Investigate Detention of Western Police Superintendent, Considers Incident Closed, No Protest Filed, Police Department Disagrees with Japanese Side

The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 14th) British officials stated that the British Consulate will not protest the detention of Police Superintendent Lees of the Public Concession Police Department by the Japanese on Thursday near noon at the Waterfront Hotel. The Police Department has submitted a report on the matter to the British Consulate General, but compared to other more important issues encountered by British officials in Shanghai and the Far East, its nature is insignificant, so no protest will be filed. It is noted that Lees was threatened by Japanese military police while investigating the Japanese military police injuring a Chinese boatman at Pier 5 on the Bund and was released after being forced to enter the Waterfront Hotel for twenty minutes. It is heard that the British authorities now consider this case closed. A Japanese military spokesman stated at a press conference yesterday the Japanese view on the detention of Lees, saying that according to the Land Regulations, the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council does not extend to the Huangpu River, and the news reported by local newspapers is inaccurate. According to the Japanese investigation, the truth is as follows: Around 11:15 AM on Thursday, the Japanese naval police saw two boats about to moor at the Bund pier and boarded them for inspection. A Chinese boatman jumped onto the pier to escape. The Japanese military police chased him back to the boat. At that time, a Western police superintendent, later identified as Police Superintendent Lees of the Police Department, boarded the boat and spoke. The Japanese military police did not understand him and could not answer, "creating a very strange situation." The Japanese military police gestured to indicate that Lees should go ashore, but Lees remained on the boat. The Japanese military police then invited Lees to go to the naval police headquarters at the Waterfront Hotel. Later, Assistant Superintendent Samson of the Police Department, along with a Chinese constable, also went to the Waterfront Hotel to explain the matter. Afterwards, Samson, Lees, and the Chinese constable left the Waterfront Hotel. According to the Japanese authorities, the Police Department has no jurisdiction over boats moored at the pier. The Police Department disagrees with this point. Assistant Superintendent Samson exchanged views with the Japanese officer in charge of the Waterfront Hotel on the matter. The spokesman also answered questions, saying that the Japanese side still holds its own opinion on this issue. He does not know if the Police Department also insists on its own opinion, but the Public Concession does not extend to the Huangpu River, and "the Land Regulations do not stipulate that the Municipal Council has jurisdiction over the Huangpu River." The Lees case has now been resolved, and there is no problem with his detention at the Waterfront Hotel. The claim that the Chinese boatman was seriously injured is not true. He only suffered minor injuries. When asked if the boatman had been arrested, the spokesman replied that the Chinese "may have been arrested."

### British Ambassador Denies Retirement Rumors, Says Japanese Newspaper's Report is Unreliable, Has Written to Tokyo Requesting Correction

The report in the Japanese "Daily News" in Tokyo that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has expressed his intention to retire to London, England, has been denied by British officials and dismissed as unfounded. The British Embassy in this port has also denied it, saying that this statement is completely baseless. The British Ambassador has now written to Tokyo, asking Ambassador Craigie to request the "Daily News" to make a correction.

### Large Building on Yuyuan Road Undergoing Renovation, New Brick Walls Built Around, Topped with Spiked Iron Fences

The Continental Daily reports that a large residence near Hollywood Amusement Park in the Japanese-occupied area along Yuyuan Road is currently undergoing renovation, but its activities are kept strictly secret. The residence was once a private house. Now, Chinese workers are turning it into a small fortress, building new brick walls around it and installing spiked iron fences up to three feet high on top of the walls. A small fortress has been built at the entrance. Because there are some gangsters in front of the door, reporters cannot reach the residence and ask the workers. However, according to reliable sources, the place will be used as an office for some party. It is said that the residence used to be the residence of a high-ranking official of the National Government. It is heard that it was recently rented by someone related to a certain party and is being renovated and "fortified."

### New Hurricane Makes Landfall in Southern Fujian, Shanghai May Avoid Impact, Currently Located 120 Nautical Miles West of Wenzhou, Moving North-Northwest Towards Fujian and Jiangxi

After this port was severely hit by a Pacific hurricane on the 13th, causing great damage, a new hurricane arose near Luzon Island and came towards the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Yesterday morning, it was learned that although the initial progress of the new hurricane was very slow, since the night before last, it suddenly moved rapidly in a west-northwest direction. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane had reached 26 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within a radius of 30 nautical miles (not that the wind force was within an area of 30 nautical miles). The wind force was at level 8. The observatory subsequently reported at 5:00 PM that the new hurricane had made landfall on the southern coast of Fujian Province and was moving in a north-northwest direction. At 2:00 PM, it was at 28 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude. According to the above report, the position is west of Wenzhou, a distance of 120 nautical miles, which clearly indicates that it will blow towards the Fujian and Jiangxi areas. Shanghai may avoid the impact. Also, yesterday morning, Shanghai's weather changed dramatically due to the wind whiskers being touched. The sky was overcast and cloudy, and the gale was blowing. In the afternoon, because the hurricane had changed direction, the weather returned to normal. Also, the Shanghai Huangpu River floods: during the hurricane that hit Shanghai on the afternoon of the 13th, the water level was only four feet, but the tide was suddenly raised more than ten feet. If a high tide coincides, Shanghai's floods are still a concern.

### After the Import Ban is Issued, Various Industries Request Relief, Should Seek Ways to Handle Goods Stopped En Route, Issue Purchase and Transportation Certificates for Legitimate Purposes

After the Ministry of Finance announced the measures to ban the import of goods during the extraordinary period, the Inspector General of Customs was ordered to instruct customs offices in various places to comply. Various industries are preparing to request relief measures from the Ministry of Finance so that goods stopped en route can be handled separately. The Inspector General of Customs is to provide an explanation for transit goods. The details are as follows:

How to Remedy Goods Already En Route?

The measures to ban the import of goods stipulate that the goods that should be banned include 18 groups and 234 tariff items. At the same time, after the ban is issued, transit is not allowed. Now, customs offices in various non-occupied areas have been ordered to implement it. Various industries in Shanghai City believe that some transit goods have been stored in coastal defenses for several months or half a year due to transportation reasons and have not been able to reach the transit port. Are there any supplementary measures for the goods whose import is banned this time, such as visa-type procedures, so that the goods stopped en route can be handled separately? They have already requested the Inspector General of Customs to investigate and reply.

Restrictions on Transit Goods

It is heard that the Inspector General of Customs once received an order from the government that for all goods whose import is banned, except for goods declared for transit, if they had already paid taxes at the original port of import before the ban was issued, and at the time of tax payment, the original port of import was still under the administration of the Chinese government, they may be allowed to import after presenting conclusive evidence upon arrival at the destination port. All others will not be allowed to import. The bureau is implementing this ban, and before receiving instructions from the government, for goods that were ordered from abroad or shipped from abroad to China before the ban was issued, and goods shipped from various guerrilla area customs offices to ports outside the war zone, if the above conclusive evidence is not verified, they should all be banned from import in accordance with the order.

Special Goods, Issue Special Permits

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from various related industries yesterday that various industries in Shanghai related to imported goods are currently considering this matter and preparing to directly request relief measures from the Ministry of Finance. It is also heard that for items whose import is banned, if it is for adjusting market prices in the rear, supplying special uses, or for other legitimate reasons, the Ministry of Finance may review the actual needs and issue special purchase and transportation permits. It is heard that the decision to ban the import of a portion of items is actually a necessary measure during wartime, so it has been deeply understood by both Chinese and foreigners. After the implementation of the import ban, based on the import volume in 1938, more than 23 million yuan can be saved annually.

Various Customs Offices Ordered to Implement Immediately

Customs offices outside the war zone have successively been ordered to implement it, including Tengyue, Simao, Mengzi, Longzhou, Beihai, Leizhou, Nanning, Wuzhou, Jiangmen, Gongbei, Fuzhou, Sanduao, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing. As for the customs offices in the occupied areas, because the localities have already fallen and are beyond the reach of the government's power, there are difficulties in the actual implementation, so the implementation will be temporarily postponed, including Shanghai, Hankou, Xiamen, Qiongzhou, Guangzhou, as well as Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Qinhuangdao, Longkou, and other customs offices in North China.

### Sister-in-Law Accuses Brother-in-Law of Indecent Assault, Case Settled Out of Court, Lawsuit Withdrawn

Shen Sunshi from Shaoxing, a 25-year-old weaving worker currently living at No. 96, Lianyi Lane, Rue de la Mission, and her husband Shen Boquan, 29 years old this year, previously lived with Mrs. Shao Sunshi, her elder sister, and Shao Anian, her brother-in-law, at No. 52, Wufeng Lane, Rue de la Mission. Because Shao coveted the beauty of his sister-in-law Sunshi, he often teased and seduced her. After Sunshi refused, fearing an accident, she and her husband moved to Lianyi Lane on the 5th of this month. Shao Anian refused to allow his sister-in-law to move out, resulting in a verbal and physical altercation. Sunshi's clothes were torn, and she was beaten in the chest, left shoulder, eyes, and other places, making her unable to work. Therefore, Shen Sunshi hired lawyer Zhang Zhongqi to file a private prosecution against her brother-in-law Shao Anian for assault in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The court accepted the case and summoned the parties for a hearing yesterday by Judge Jiang Fengquan. Both sides arrived in court with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff stated that the defendant Shao Anian's teasing was unbearable, the move was obstructed, and the beating occurred. She also listed her husband Shen Boquan as a witness. The defendant denied the assault and the plaintiff's claims, saying that the plaintiff came to his house at the age of fifteen and he raised her until she married at the age of twenty. He had always treated her very well. On that day, she lay on the ground herself, causing her clothes to be torn. The witness, the plaintiff's husband Shen Boquan, because he usually received financial assistance from his brother-in-law, stated that he did not see the defendant commit the violence. The court examined the confession and advised them to settle out of court, ordering the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for losses of five yuan. With the agreement of both parties, a settlement was reached, and the case was dismissed.

After the police thoroughly investigated the case, the suspects only admitted to smoking, and the evidence for trafficking was insufficient. Yesterday, the case was changed to be sent to the Eighth Criminal Court. As a result, it was not accepted. The court president Liao then opened a special court for trial. First, the police lawyer stated that in addition to the first defendant Yin Sen, who still needed to be investigated, there was insufficient evidence for the second defendant Chen Shimei, so he would not be prosecuted. The court examined the report and then ordered that Chen Shimei be acquitted. The defendant Yin Sen will be retried on the 18th of this month.

His wife, Huang Lansheng, remains in Shanghai, living at No. 9, Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, French Concession. Living expenses are sent monthly. However, Huang Zijian, because of his wife's misconduct, instructed his cousin Huang Xizhao (36 years old this year, residing at No. 1283, Route Lafayette) to be responsible for monitoring her. Huang Lansheng, because her husband was far away in Chongqing, was addicted to gambling in Shanghai, playing huahui and pai gow. Therefore, Huang Xizhao sent a letter to Huang Zijian in March of this year, reporting Huang Lansheng's immoral private life. Later, Huang Zijian sent another letter to reprimand his wife.

The charity bazaar organized by the Chinese Women's Professional Club to raise funds for the sanitation of refugees was held yesterday at No. 120 Nanjing Road, 3rd floor.

When questioned, the defendants confessed that they were instructed by someone to cause trouble, but claimed that they were temporarily deceived. They also hired a lawyer to defend them in court. Judge Zhong believed that this kind of charity bazaar was entirely charitable in nature, and the defendants should not have taken such action.

Wang Zuying, a local woman, 24 years old this year, married Yang Cengshu, a young Cantonese musician, eight years ago. They lived together on North Sichuan Road, in a property they owned themselves. They had two sons, who both died young. After the war two years ago, they moved to No. 288, Rue des SÅurs. Her parents ran the Jinmao Li Ji firewood shop. After Yang's father passed away last year, Yang took a singer, Zhang Ru (19 years old), as a concubine and brought her home to live with them, treating Wang like an old fan in autumn. Wang, unable to bear the abuse, returned to her mother's home at No. 4, Lane 96, Route Doumer. Yang abandoned her and paid her no heed. Yang Wang Zuying hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit for divorce against Yang Cengshu in the Second Special Court, and claimed a total of 25,200 yuan in alimony and damages for the period up to the age of sixty. Judge Chen opened the court several times and summoned both parents and Yang's concubine to the court for investigation. As there was no room for mediation, a debate was held in court a few days ago. The plaintiff's attorney stated that the defendant Yang Cengshu and his lover Zhang Ru and his wife Wang Zuying were all young, and if a divorce was not granted, these three young men and women would inevitably be sent to the fiery pit. This abnormal family is in conflict with the modern system. If they can be divorced, each can take the path of light, which will be beneficial, and so on. Therefore, the court verified the words and announced that the sentencing would be scheduled. Yesterday was the date for the sentencing. Both parties came to the court with their relatives and friends. The presiding judge took the seat and announced the sentence: the plaintiff was granted a divorce from the defendant, and the defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff 22,200 yuan in alimony and bear the litigation costs. It is said that the defendant was dissatisfied with the verdict and will appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court.

### Market Price Survey

Due to the approaching of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, local markets selling fish and meat have seen a surge in purchases of chicken, duck, fish, and meat for "white vegetarian meals" due to the Suzhou custom of eating vegetarian food during the sixth month. As a result, the supply of meat and poultry from vendors cannot meet the demand, and transportation from the interior is difficult, causing prices to rise sharply. The prices of vegetables and meat sold in the British and French Concession markets yesterday morning are as follows: "Meat" Fresh pork is nominally one yuan per catty, but actually only 12 taels of lean meat are provided and weights are based on the city scales. Fresh shrimp is one jiao per two, or 1.6 yuan per catty. Even dead or substandard shrimp must be sold for 6.4 jiao per catty.

### Grass Court Tennis Mixed Doubles: Carson's Team Retains the Championship; Li Guofan's Team Suffers a Crushing 2-0 Defeat Yesterday

The 1939 mixed doubles final, organized by the Grass Court Tennis Club, between Li Guofan and Mrs. Klinot against Carson and Mrs. Hayles, took place at the French Chamber of Commerce court at 5:00 PM yesterday. There were over 300 spectators. However, the strong wind greatly affected the performance of both sides. Carson's heroic style was still there, and Mrs. Hayles also had many wonderful shots. Li Guofan's performance was abnormal, with many self-inflicted errors. Mrs. Klinot had some good structures when blocking the net, but unfortunately, her weight made it inconvenient to run, so the merits and demerits were offset. After each side had one, Carson and Hayles completed it in one go and won the first set 6-1. In the second set, Li and Ke tried to retaliate, and the battle situation became tense. Each side tied three times at 2-2, 3-3, and 4-4. Mrs. Ke served, and Li repeatedly made mistakes and was broken. Carson and Hayles then took the lead 5-4, then won again 6-4. As a result, Carson and Hayles retained the championship with a straight two sets. The secretary, Spik, presented the awards on the spot and dispersed.

### Youlian Lost to Nanguang by One Point; Ning Shao Crushed Muir; Private Shanghai Basketball Has Eight Games Today

In the Private Shanghai Cup basketball game, there were five games yesterday. The games between Pyramid and Guoguang C, and Xianyao and the Eagles were all at a decent level. In the women's group, Black Hawk's three wins against China became a one-sided situation. In the Group A game, Youlian was unusual in the first half against Nanguang. Nanguang pressed closer and closer, causing Youlian to lose sight of the other. Although the score rose and fell, Nanguang had more momentum. The first half ended 19-14, with Youlian trailing by five points. In the second battle, Youlian rose up, and Lu Gusui took the lead. The score was very close. Until the last minute, Little Lu got two chances to shoot, but unfortunately, he scored once and missed once, resulting in a narrow 32-31 defeat to Nanguang by one point. When Little Lu's last shot landed, the bell rang. If he had scored, Youlian would have turned the tables. In the final match between Ning Shao and Muir, all three musketeers of Ning Shao attended and played with a formal lineup. Muir was naturally no match, and the result became a one-sided situation.

### Finance: Japanese Merchants Have Ample Legal Tender, Forward Exchange for Imports, Spot for Exports; Foreign Bank Supply Relatively Robust, Market Conditions Ease; Sassoon and Chinese Merchants Still Buying Cheaply

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions saw no changes in HSBC's listings. Although settlement demand from oil companies like Texaco, Mobil, and Asia was strong in the British and American exchange markets, HSBC maintained its supply. Moreover, other foreign banks, anticipating a continued rise in the British pound, increased their willingness to sell American dollars, leading to a slightly firmer trend in British currency and a slight softening in American currency. However, there were slight fluctuations in the seven- and eight-month futures, initially softening and then slightly rebounding. Initially, rumors of a domestic public entity restructuring circulated yesterday afternoon, but these were dispelled, calming speculation. Buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and with ample supply from Chinese and foreign banks, market conditions eased. The British pound for this month's gold settlement rose to 6 pence 4375, and the American dollar softened to 12.5 yuan. The British pound for August gold also rose to 6 pence 15625, and the American dollar reached 12 yuan. Subsequently, Western merchants like Sassoon and Chinese speculators bought cheaply, causing market conditions to soften, but the final result was still slightly firmer. It is rumored that Japanese banks absorbed spot currency and settled futures contracts, likely due to recently obtaining legal tender in occupied territories. At noon, foreign banks conducted British-American exchange swaps at a rate of 4 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen 2 li 2, with active trading throughout the morning. The Hong Kong exchange rate slightly strengthened due to increased selling interest from foreign banks.

Early this morning, London telegraph reported long-term trend: near-term up .0625, far-term up .125. New York silver prices remained unchanged. London gold up slightly, half a pence. Exchange rate: British currency up 3 hao against American currency, down .125 against Shanghai currency, up 1 sheng ding against French currency. American currency unchanged against British, Shanghai, and French currencies. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged (application stopped). Banks opened with spot selling prices: British gold at 6 pence 5625, American dollars at 12.75 yuan, unchanged from the previous close. Foreign banks' selling interest increased, especially for futures. Moreover, those who had bought previously, upon hearing that the rumors circulating yesterday about a certain public entity restructuring had been dispelled, mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Hence, spot market remained flat, while futures immediately strengthened. It is reported that a foreign company absorbed spot American dollars from a certain bank at 12.75 yuan. When HSBC announced its unchanged listing and the silver balancing tax remained exempt, Chinese merchants and banks also increased their selling interest, competing to supply forward British and American gold. Therefore, although Western merchants like Sassoon and Chinese speculators absorbed them, demand could not match supply, causing conditions to become firmer. Foreign and Chinese banks sequentially supplied Sassoon and Chinese merchants this month's British gold at 6 pence 4375 and 40625, and this month's American dollars at 12.5 yuan and 4375. Subsequently, Sassoon purchased August British gold from a Chinese bank at 6 pence 125, while buyers of August American dollars also pushed the price above 12 yuan. Later, a certain party supplied Anda of the same trade this month's American dollars at 12.5 yuan. Near noon, oil companies suddenly started buying, but banks' selling interest remained strong, keeping conditions stable. It is reported that the Asia oil company absorbed spot British gold from HSBC at 6 pence 5625, while Mobil and Texaco successively purchased spot American dollars from American banks at 12.75 yuan and 78125. Later, a profit was sold to the Netherlands for August American dollars at 11.9375. At that time, foreign banks again swapped British and American exchange rates at a price of 4 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen 2 li 2. At that time, the Hong Kong exchange rate strengthened due to increased selling interest from foreign banks. It is rumored that the spot selling price had risen back to 44 yuan, but no transactions were reported. At noon closing, banks' spot selling prices were: British gold at 5 pence 5625, American dollars at 12.78125, this month's British gold at 6 pence 40625, American dollars at 12.4375, August British gold at 6 pence 125, American dollars at 11.9375. Compared to the previous day, spot results showed that British currency remained flat, American currency slightly firmer by .03125, this month's British currency cheaper by .0625, American currency also softened by .0625, August British currency firmer by .0625, American currency softened by .125. The Hong Kong exchange rate also strengthened by .125 according to bank selling prices. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The half-day's trading records are listed below.

### Hong Kong Telegraph Refutes Rumors: Spot Cash Opens with a Sharp Drop, Ends with a Softening of Foreign Exchange Futures, Presenting a Trend of Easy Rise and Difficult Fall

Yesterday's black market conditions for immediate cash only had a half-day of trading in the morning. In the afternoon, because there was no foreign exchange market on Saturday, the same industry decided to stop trading for half a day. However, yesterday morning's situation initially showed a trend of exhaustion, with a direct downward slide. Then, it gradually rose slowly. The opening in the morning was due to rumors of changes in a certain domestic public entity, which had already been refuted by the Hong Kong Telegraph. In addition, the foreign exchange futures were strengthened, and the price of discounting cash notes had returned outside of 100 yuan. Therefore, buyers were more cautious and waited and watched. As a result, there was a lack of support for a while, and it suddenly fell sharply to 2,606 yuan at the opening. Later, money exchange businesses purchased on behalf of individual investors at low prices, and a certain bank absorbed on behalf of foreign companies, causing the market conditions to gradually stabilize. At noon, because the foreign exchange futures softened and the Hong Kong gangs searched and purchased, the trend became firmer, and it closed at 2,619 yuan, the high point of the day. However, the result was still a net drop of 11 yuan. Approximately 500 taels were traded in the half day. Gold ornaments in silver shops initially fell and then rose, ultimately listed at a small increase of 1 yuan. Customs gold remained flat. Fine gold and other items slightly decreased.

Immediate Cash Price Drops by a Net Eleven Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened initially without any changes. Then, because the black market was rumored to have changes in a certain domestic entity, as acknowledged by a telegram from Hong Kong, people's hearts were suddenly empty. In addition, it was heard that foreign exchange futures were strengthening, so selling became increasingly strong, and the desire to sell off cash notes became more intense. At that time, most buyers were watching from the sidelines, causing the market conditions to become exhausted. At 9:40, the market opened with a sharp drop of 24 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 taels to money exchange businesses at a price of 2,606 yuan. After the opening, securities firms and money exchange businesses each absorbed 20 taels of cash notes at a price of 07 yuan each. At that time, buyers absorbed quite strongly at low prices, and a certain foreign company also accepted. The market price suddenly rose by 3 yuan in an instant. Silver shops purchased 50 taels from money exchange businesses, and a certain bank (on behalf of foreign companies) purchased 50 taels of cash notes at a price of 10 yuan each. A certain bank again purchased 10 taels from money exchange businesses at a price of 11.5 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses purchased 10 taels of cash notes and traded 20 taels among themselves at a price of 13 yuan each. At that time, money exchange businesses absorbed more strongly, and the price was raised by 2 yuan before long. Money exchange businesses purchased 30 taels from silver shops at a price of 15 yuan. Another money exchange business again purchased 40 taels from a gold shop and 50 taels from the same industry at a price of 16 yuan each. Near noon, it was suddenly heard that the foreign exchange futures had returned to battle. In addition, the Hong Kong gangs' acceptance was particularly good, and the market conditions became stronger. The price was raised by another 3 yuan. A certain silver shop (on behalf of the Hong Kong gangs) purchased 50 taels each from securities firms and money exchange businesses at a price of 19 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because the value of foreign exchange was not available for Saturday trading, the same industry decided to stop trading for half a day. As a result, the noon closing price of 2,619 yuan was a net drop of 11 yuan from the previous day. With a range of 13 yuan, the selling price of the main brand gold of cash notes was 2,625 yuan, and the purchasing price was 2,610 yuan. The current quoted gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, few transactions were made.

Gold Ornaments Also Fell First and Then Recovered

For silver shop gold jewelry, the exchange price for each tael initially remained unchanged. Then, at 10:00, because the black market opened with a sharp drop, the price was listed at a small decrease of 2 yuan. Later, at 12:10, because the black market had risen, the price also rose by 1 yuan. The large counterparts changed the listing to 265 yuan, the new counterparts were 263 yuan, and the purchasing price was 257 yuan.

Fine British Gold Contracts Half a Penny

A telegraph from London on the 14th reported that fine British gold contracted by half a penny per ounce due to the firm rise of the British pound, declining to 7 pounds 8 shillings 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Chinese cash purchase price of the Central Bank was also lowered to 1,211 yuan 9 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 4 jiao to 1,207 yuan 2 jiao.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Rise Slightly

A telegraph from London on the 14th reported that the silver market had a few Indian purchases, and speculators were both buying and selling. The market was flat, and remained flat after the close. India reissued at the listed price, but buyers were watching. The long-term trend of large silver was up .0625 in the near term and up .125 in the far term. New York silver telegraph: American spot prices unchanged. Also, a Bombay silver telegraph: the Indian silver market was calm, the spot price rose by 3 anna, July rose by 2 anna, and August rose by only 1 anna. A total of 100 orders were transacted.

### More and More Arbitrageurs: Discount Rate Reaches Beyond 100 Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts rose sharply, exceeding 100 yuan per thousand yuan. Recently, the gap between near- and far-term foreign exchange rates has become enormous, making arbitrageurs even more enthusiastic. Both cash and foreign currency purchases require cash, leading to a shortage of funds and triggering rising prices. Initially, the rate reached 100 yuan in the morning, then rose to 106 yuan. Near noon, it dropped back to 102 yuan, then rose to 104 yuan in the afternoon before gradually dropping back to 100 yuan, 5 yuan 7 jiao and a half higher than the previous day. The interest rate for the Money Industry Association remained unchanged, 1 jiao and 8 fen for both morning and afternoon sessions.

### British and American Gold Pounds Rise Sharply and Then Retreat Slightly

Yesterday, fine British gold fell by half a penny. British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Local foreign exchange firms settled accounts heavily. Western merchants and speculators absorbed actively. Foreign banks provided ample supply. Market conditions were flat for British currency and soft for American currency. The British exchange rate remained at 6 pence 5625, and the American exchange rate was 12 yuan 78125, a retreat of .03125 from the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Due to many arbitrageurs of drafts, the black market opened with a softening trend in the far term, and customers dumped shares, creating a low opening of 2,606 yuan. Silver shop cash notes absorbed at low prices, and the market conditions were firm, rising to 22 yuan. The noon close was 19 yuan. Trading was not opened in the afternoon. As a result, there was a drop of 11 yuan compared to the previous day. The demand for British and American gold pounds was not strong, and the black market retreated, so the market conditions were weak. There was active trading of British and American gold notes. However, far-term drafts trended softer, and the supply was relatively smooth, so prices all retreated. There was not active trading in Hong Kong notes and French franc notes, and they were both stable. The demand and supply for Japanese gold notes was equal, and the evening price remained at 9 jiao and 9 fen and a half. The demand for Korean notes was stagnant, and the market conditions were weak. The evening price was 8 jiao and 5 fen and a half. There were few transactions at the public association. Rentai issued and Changtai entered American gold notes for 400 yuan. Litong issued and Changtai entered American gold notes for 200 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds each dropped by 2 jiao, British gold notes dropped by 5 fen, American gold notes dropped by 1 fen and 5 li. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Fall Again, Foreign Stocks Await Opportunity

The securities black market showed a declining trend yesterday, indicating that despite the news being spread, the market had reservations about the reliability of the news before the official documents were issued. There were also rumors of a certain person resigning, leading many parties to be more cautious and slowly sell off their holdings. The market did not have a large range of rises and falls. Since the market opened on July 4th, it had risen for three days, then fallen for three days, then recovered for two days, and now has fallen again. The wavering is unstable, fully demonstrating the anxiety of the people. Those who are skilled and calculated believed that even if the principal and interest were paid according to the rumored exchange draft method, the C bonds would only be worth 45 or 46 yuan. After the opening yesterday, the A bonds fell by several jiao, approaching the 9 yuan mark, and then broke through. The B bonds also retreated into the 50 yuan range. Trading remained sluggish. Buyers such as Shunhongkang and Datong No. 11 were not active in absorbing, and sellers such as Tiansheng Runli Yongfeng Songmao and No. 41 were also not eager to sell. The declining trend did not turn around. As a result, the A bonds dropped sharply by 1 yuan, and the others also dropped by a small 5 or 6 jiao. The total number of transactions was only about 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below. It is possible that today's market will be supported by the British Parliament's strong support for increasing credit loans to China, and the rumors of resignation have not been confirmed.

Stock transactions: 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 37 yuan.

Stock Market of the Public Industry Association: People are waiting for better news, namely the development of international relations in this area. However, unfortunately, there is nothing new at the moment, and the market continues to decline. Speculators have no direction, and investors are not optimistic. We must wait for the situation to develop. The market sentiment in London and New York has been better recently, especially in New York. However, it is not accurate to say that the new political situation will not cause problems. Therefore, this city is difficult to follow its lead. Rubber unexpectedly showed that American consumption in June was 2,900 tons higher than in May, with a total of 47,300 tons consumed. Inventories are down 11,800 tons, and now there are only 181,800 tons left. This is the lowest inventory since August 1937.

London British Far East Companies' stocks listed prices on the 14th of this month (Friday) fell slightly. HSBC Bank's British registered shares fell by half a pound, with a price of 78 and a half pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine's bearer shares fell by 3 pence, with a price of 17 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.

London Chinese Foreign Debt Listed Prices on the 14th of this month (Friday). There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds. British physical sales: 2,000 pounds of Chinese-French American dollars (with imprint) (i.e., 10,000 American dollars) were sold at 37 pounds, a 3-pound discount from the market price. The British-issued good post-loan of 1,000 pounds was sold at 31 pounds, a 1-pound discount from the market price. Also, the German-issued with imprint of 1,000 pounds was sold at 29 pounds, a 3-pound discount from the market price.

### Suspension of Interest Payment on Sino-French American Dollar Bonds

The Sino-French 5% American Dollar Bonds of 1925 were issued on May 27th of the 14th year of the Republic of China, with a total amount of $43,893,900 American dollars. The original term was 23 years, with one lottery redemption per year, to be fully redeemed by January 15th of the 37th year of the Republic of China. To date, in addition to the 14 issues that have been repaid, there is still a face value of $22,136,650 American dollars outstanding. Yesterday was the payment date for the 29th-term interest coupon, with interest of $553,416.25 American dollars due. Inquiries with the paying agent, the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, revealed that the funds had not yet been allocated and that payment would be temporarily suspended.

### Four Banks Savings Society Dividends: Semi-Annual Surplus Reaches 400,000, Members' Dividends are 1.2%

The Four Banks Savings Society, jointly established by the Yanye, Jincheng, Zhongnan, and Dalu Banks, pioneered a deposit dividend system with excellent methods and outstanding credit, making it the only savings institution in China. Since Mr. Qian Xinzhi took office as the manager of the Society in the 15th year of the Republic of China, its business has become even more developed. The total amount of savings reached a maximum of 100 million yuan, with more than 100,000 depositors. It is now reported that the Society's accounts for the first half of this year show a surplus of more than 400,060,000 national currency, with members' dividends still at 1.2%. The two-year fixed savings deposit, with the same interest rate protection of 7%, totals 8.2%, the same as in the 27th year.

### Yarn and Cloth: Guangxi Merchants Have Full Capacity, Yarn Market Declines, Japanese Yarn Alone Rises by 4 Yuan

The yarn market, which had risen for three consecutive days, entered a stagnant path yesterday. The Guangxi and Yunnan merchants, who had been continuously purchasing, had full purchasing capacity, and the ships had already set sail. Further transactions would have to wait until the goods had arrived at their destinations and been digested. As a result, actual business decreased significantly today. Colleagues' hearts were soft. 20-count Shuangma yarn fell back from 490 yuan to 487 yuan. As for the customer groups, only the Hong Kong merchants purchased 345 bales of coarse and fine yarn. Other groups had very little appetite. The market felt even more mediocre. The banknote discount rate rose again. However, a portion of the psychology was that the far-term foreign exchange rate had shrunk again, and the minds were still bullish. The fundamental problem still lies in the practical sales as the guideline.

The situation of the current yarn market. At the beginning of the morning market, colleagues were all bullish and called up prices uniformly. It was also said that the exchange rate had softened. Because the demand in the south has been good recently, the opening price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was raised by 2-3 yuan to 490 yuan for foreign warehouse goods and 484.5 yuan for warehouse receipts. After this price was opened, it was unexpected that the Guangxi merchants' purchases were not strong and they all called for no transactions. The market price suddenly returned to flat and declined. In the middle, colleagues, in view of the fact that practical sales were not moving, also gave up and watched. Therefore, there were no major changes, and transactions were very scarce. By the close of the market, the price of 20-count Shuangma yarn in foreign warehouses was 488 yuan, and the price of warehouse receipts was 482 yuan. The factories did not take any major actions. According to the half-day transaction statistics, only 787 bales were traded. The market price of 20-count Shuangma and Muyang was not much different from the previous day. However, the price of Te Jincheng fell by 2 yuan, and the price of 10-count coarse yarn fell by 2-3 yuan. Today, there are 120 pieces of cotton yarn being shipped to Hong Kong, 385 pieces being shipped to Haiphong, and tomorrow there are 20 pieces being shipped to Yantai, 50 pieces being shipped to Xiamen, 40 pieces being shipped to Hong Kong, 95 pieces being shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 100 pieces being shipped to Beihai, and 120 pieces being shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left.

Colleagues 375 Mainland 67 Previous Day's Transaction 180 Hong Kong 345 Statistics 967

The Japanese yarn market continues to be good. It is likely that the shrinking of far-term exchange drafts has stimulated the minds of speculators. There are many who are buying far-term. The market price has risen. However, practical demand transactions are not very developed. The current yarn price of 20-count Yueqin yarn is 398 yuan, up about 4 yuan.

### Rumor that the US Pledge Release Association Will Receive Cotton Pledge Funds

The market price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market remained quiet yesterday. The opening price fell slightly by 2-3 points due to telegrams from Liverpool and Bombay and the settlement of a portion of the bulls. Domestic cotton consumption in June showed slight progress, increasing to 578,448 bales. However, colleagues are all waiting for the official announcement of the US government's export subsidy details and are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the cotton market is even more stagnant. The cotton price has not improved. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 2 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 points.

Regarding the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai, it has been heard that the gold deputy's pledge release committee is hoped to be established in the coming days. However, those who apply for loans on various raw cottons must go through procedures such as sampling, appraisal, and valuation. A certain fee will be charged per 10,000 units. The details will be announced in the coming days.

The local cotton transaction remains quiet. Factories are short of legal tender funds, making it difficult to purchase. A portion of the yarn factories have absorbed enough raw materials, and there are currently no urgent purchases being made. The number of transactions is generally becoming more and more cold. However, although colleagues are doing mutual buying and selling business, the amount of achievement is also very small. However, colleagues took in 200 pieces of Bairo at a price of 102 yuan. The hurricane that delivered the exchange to the factory has dissipated. The shipping industry in northern Jiangsu has resumed. 430 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived today.

### Textiles: Difficult Situation for Chinese Textile Factories; Guerrilla Areas Have Become a "Dong Pi" World; Rebranded and Disguised Goods are Also Rampant

Domestic Cloth

Long-term foreign exchange has shrunk drastically, "Dong Pi" (Japanese Cloth) has rebounded sharply, and domestically produced dyed cloth is selling briskly, with asking prices rising by one or two "jiao". Native cotton cloth still lacks improvement, with flat opening prices. Yesterday, large buyers from Sichuan and Yunnan in the Southwest continued to purchase four or five thousand pieces of dyed cloth and dyed twill, and over a thousand pieces of broadcloth and woolen cloth. Shipping has also been robust in recent days. White cloth sales are sluggish, accounting for only one-tenth of the market, because the fine cloth and fine twill purchased from Yong'an, Shenxin, Yu and other factories in the Southwest are priced at fifteen or sixteen yuan per piece. However, dyeing factories in Shanghai are using certain imported grey fabrics, and after processing, they are even cheaper than domestically produced native cloth. Recently, there has been overproduction of certain foreign goods, leading to low prices for grey fabrics, creating an even greater price disparity. As a result, the sales performance is drastically different. This district and the guerrilla areas are already a "Dong Pi" world, and goods with altered brands and disguised origins from occupied areas are also extremely rampant. Therefore, Chinese textile factories are in a precarious situation, facing uncertainty from morning to night.

"Dong Pi" (Japanese Cloth)

White fine cloth and fine twill experienced active sales yesterday, and market sentiment strengthened. Asking prices rose across the board. "Long Tou" (Dragon Head) fine cloth rose sharply by two and a half "jiao" per piece, reaching thirteen yuan and one and a half "jiao". Merchants from Qinhuangdao in the north purchased three hundred packages of "Long Tou," "Cai Qiu" (Colored Ball), and "Fei Yu" (Flying Fish) brand fine cloth. Merchants from Tianjin purchased over three hundred pieces of fine cloth for forward delivery. Sentiment in this district has also changed. Merchants are now purchasing five hundred packages of fine cloth and fine twill for forward delivery. At the same time, the "Dong Mian Hang" (Eastern Cotton Exchange) offered four hundred packages of "Hua Wu Long Men" (Flowered Dragon Gate) brand fine cloth at twelve pounds, priced at thirteen yuan and nine and a half "jiao" per piece. Dyed broadcloth and "Zhi Gong" (Tribute) cloth also rose in price. Lower-priced "Si Jun Zi" (Four Gentlemen) broadcloth, which had reached a low of four "jiao," one "fen," and seventy-five "li" per yard, has now risen to four "jiao" and two and a half "fen". "Zhi Gong" cloth is priced at four "jiao" and one and a half "fen" (all cash). The asking price for new "Yi Sheng Da Tian" (One Sound Reaching Heaven) broadcloth from a major factory was four "jiao" and one "fen" in the previous market (half cash, half remittance). Yesterday, it also sold for four "jiao" and two "fen," and the asking price increased to four "jiao" and three "fen." Merchants in this district purchased over one hundred boxes.

Exports

Seventeen pieces of textiles were exported on the 17th, sixteen pieces to Tianjin, one hundred pieces to Yantai, five pieces to Xiamen, twenty-five pieces to Hong Kong, and three pieces to Guangzhou Bay. Another fifty pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Small Textile Factories: An Investigation into Closures

Small textile factories, whether relocated from occupied areas or newly established on the island, have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. However, in a short period, the transportation routes for cotton cloth entering the mainland have been gradually severed, and various obstacles have hindered business for merchants, leading to closures. The capital of small textile factories is inherently weak, and most are speculative. They cannot withstand such blows. Generally, each textile factory has between two or three hundred looms at most, and only a hundred or so at the least. The woven cloth primarily consists of grey plain cloth, fine plain cloth, and twill. Each loom can produce a maximum of three pieces of coarse plain cloth, each forty yards long, per day and night (fine plain cloth and twill production is less, around two pieces). Accordingly, each loom needs to prepare fifty pounds of warp, weft, and yarn per day and night. For a hundred looms, the total daily and nightly raw material requirement is five thousand pounds, which translates to approximately twelve bales of yarn, calculated at four hundred and twenty pounds per bale (two to three hundred looms would require thirty to forty bales of yarn). The total value is five to six thousand yuan. Therefore, the working capital for one month's raw material turnover is fifteen to sixteen thousand yuan. If the cotton cloth business is good, this is not a problem. With twenty to thirty thousand yuan of working capital for raw materials, the machines can operate continuously by selling finished products and purchasing cotton yarn. However, if finished products accumulate due to market sluggishness and various obstacles, the factory has no choice but to shut down and cease operations after five or six days of work. Continued shutdowns lead to financial difficulties, forcing closures. Therefore, it is increasingly common to hear of small textile factories without strong capital backing suspending or reducing operations. Even well-capitalized factories (with three hundred and sixty looms) are struggling and on the verge of closure. (Long Ju Sheng)

### Grain: Lack of Cash Hinders Flour Sales; Wheat Market Also Lacks Sparkle

Flour

The spot flour market was as uneventful as ever yesterday. Sales to merchants continue to be constrained by a lack of cash, and there has been no significant off-take. Apart from some re-circulated goods being offered in the market, very few are purchasing directly from factories with cash. Even retail transactions in this district favor purchasing re-circulated goods, as they are cheaper than factory prices due to remittances. Total market transactions, including those with merchants, amounted to only thirteen to fifteen thousand bags. Factory prices for number two flour still require four yuan and six and a half "jiao" in cash, while re-circulated goods are offered at only four yuan and nine and a half "jiao" for remittance.

Wheat

Yesterday, the supply of wheat continued to arrive uninterrupted. The amount of goods held by merchants on the docks and offered for sale gradually increased. The only outlet is the Japanese factory. However, the Japanese factory's intake has been limited recently, often suppressing prices. The entire factory has also recently set prices for foreign wheat, further dampening the demand for local wheat. As a result, the market lacks sparkle. Yesterday, the market was quiet with few transactions as supply and demand prices were difficult to reconcile.

### Hot and Humid Weather; Rice Market Continues to Decline

Du Geng (Rice Variety): Yesterday, the domestic rice market continued its downward trend. With weak sentiment, merchants and traders continued to sell off their holdings. The only sales channel in this district remains sluggish. Cheap goods from inland merchants have some outlet, but the declining market conditions are difficult to support. As a result, prices for thick and thin "Geng" (Japonica) rice and "Du Yang Jian" (Du Yang Pointed) and "Bu Jian" (Port Pointed) rice fell by two to three "jiao". Arrivals from the river are still limited to number two rice from the Songjiang merchant, with 1,400 to 1,500 bags of "Che Shu Baozi" (Cart-Transported Steamed Bun) and "Nan Gang" (South Port) rice. Total market transactions amounted to over seven thousand "shi".

Ke Xian (Rice Variety): Sales to inland areas are unlikely to improve, and arrivals are continuous. Dockside storage is full, and merchants are willing to reduce prices due to the hot weather causing rice to steam. Amid widespread price declines in the rice market, another severe drop was seen. High-quality "Xian" (Indica) rice fell by two to three "jiao," while overnight settlements dropped by as much as four, five, or six "jiao". High-quality "Jing Xian" (Capital Indica) rice is priced at fifteen yuan and six or seven "jiao," and high-quality "Wu Xian" (Wuhu Indica) rice is priced at fifteen yuan and five "jiao," with separate settlements. "Zhong Guan" (Central Gate) rice is even weaker due to sluggish inland sales, priced at slightly over thirteen yuan. However, transaction volume was limited to three thousand five or six hundred bags due to the market being closed for Sunday, mostly from this district.

Bian Yuan (Rice Variety): Transactions remain scarce. Given the current rice market situation, with ample dockside storage and Wuhu prices also reportedly declining, sentiment is unlikely to rebound in the short term.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Declines Again

According to Reuters news from London yesterday, near-term August sugar prices fell sharply by four and a quarter "bian shi" to seven shillings and one and a half "bian shi," while longer-term prices rose slightly by a quarter. December is at six shillings and two and a half "bian shi," and March of next year is at six shillings and three "bian shi". The local association's listed price for spot number 24 coarse white sugar fell by two "jiao". The price at this warehouse is twenty-nine yuan and three "jiao," and the price at other warehouses fell by one "jiao." Re-export goods fell by three "jiao," with two hundred bags transacted at twenty-one yuan. "Tai Gu" (Taikoo) white sugar saw a larger price reduction, with top-grade sugar falling by four to five "jiao." Western warehouse B mark is thirty yuan and six "jiao," Eastern warehouse is four "jiao" for one hundred bags. CW mark is thirty yuan and three "jiao" at the western warehouse, CX is thirty yuan, DY mark is twenty-nine yuan and seven "jiao," and HX mark is twenty-nine yuan and a half. Locally produced cotton white sugar fell by five "jiao." Zhen Ji number one is twenty-nine yuan, and numbers two, three, and four are discounted accordingly. There were no other significant price changes. Only the Chaozhou merchants offered forty bags of ice flower white sugar for domestic sugar. The quality is ordinary, and the price is twenty-seven yuan and seven "jiao".

### Oilseed Cakes: Soybean Cake Transactions Become Active

Yesterday, the oil market was in a state of disarray, with various merchants reluctant to make progress and unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in a stalemate. The market did not open, but the soybean cake market became active, and transactions commenced. Owners seized the opportunity to raise prices, allowing market prices to rise frequently. As a result, prices rose by four to five "fen" compared to the previous market. Five thousand pieces of "Da Yun Yuan Ji" (Great Fortune Source Mark) cake were offered, and the price increased from three yuan and nine "fen" to three yuan and one "jiao" and three "fen". Seven thousand pieces of miscellaneous brand cake were priced at three yuan and seven "fen," eventually reaching three yuan and one "jiao".

### Dried Seafood: Arrowroot Flour and Sago Remain Firm

Sales of arrowroot flour are strongest in this district, as transportation to other ports is largely obstructed. The current market price is twenty-one yuan for "Ren Qiang" (Human Gun), twenty yuan for "Fei Qi Lin" (Flying Unicorn), nineteen yuan and five "jiao" for "San X" (Triple X), nineteen yuan and five "jiao" for "KG", and seventeen yuan for "Shuang T" (Double T), all for cash. Sales of sago are also good, with large granules at twenty-three yuan and small granules at twenty-one yuan, also for cash transactions, demonstrating strong performance.

### Domestically Produced Fragrant Mushrooms: Shanghai Inventory Nearing Depletion

The supply of domestically produced fragrant mushrooms from various ports has been disrupted. Local inventory is nearing depletion, leading to rising market prices. For example, "Jian Gu" (Jianning Mushrooms) opened at three hundred and thirty yuan in the previous market and subsequently rose to three hundred and fifty yuan. The current market price is three hundred and eighty yuan, representing a significant increase of twenty to thirty yuan.

### Zhabei Goods: Preserved Peaches Continue to Rise

Preserved peaches have seen limited arrivals and active sales, leading to another price increase. Cold storage Tianjin peaches have risen to ninety yuan. Tiger skin peaches are selling for sixty-five to sixty-six yuan, with some asking for seventy yuan. Walnut kernels are also becoming tight, with hand-picked peaches at forty-eight yuan, settlements at forty-two to forty-three yuan, and southern peaches at thirty yuan.

### Wood Ear Sales are Active

Wood ear has been selling actively recently. Sichuan wood ear is currently selling for one hundred and eighty-five yuan, Han wood ear for one hundred and ninety yuan, mail-package wood ear for one hundred and eighty-five to ninety yuan, and deputy wood ear for two hundred and forty yuan, demonstrating strong performance.

### Metals: American Iron is Selling Well Only in Tianjin

American narrow strip tinplate has been quite active recently. The reason is that merchants from Tianjin are buying up large quantities. In addition, buyers from Yantai and Qingdao are also actively purchasing. Other sectors in this district (such as cigarette factories and can manufacturers) also have strong demand. Moreover, there is not much spot inventory in this port, so sentiment is very good. The standard asking price is unlikely to loosen for the time being. The current market price for assorted colors is forty-six yuan per box (calculated at two hundred pounds), the price for single-pick large colors is fifty-two yuan per box, and the price for single-pick small colors is only forty yuan per box, all higher than the previous market by one to two yuan. Overseas orders are also not very large, so quoted prices have also risen slightly by a few "jin jiao" compared to before. The current overseas price is reportedly sixty-two US dollars per ton.

### Coal: Pacific Coal Arrives, Approximately Two Hundred Tons

The bituminous coal business experienced a period of strong sales last month, but it has been rather quiet recently. This is because demanders have gradually satisfied their needs, and the supply from various sources is continuous, resulting in sluggish transactions and stable market prices. Yesterday, a foreign firm had over two hundred tons of Pacific coal arrive in port. The listed price is thirty-four yuan per ton for lump coal, thirty-seven yuan for block coal, and thirty-nine yuan for premium block coal. The foreign warehouse charges extra for lighterage.

### Indian Coal Arrives Continuously

Indian coal is arriving one after another. The Baron Jedburyh, managed by Jardine Matheson, transported 6,625 tons of coal from Calcutta and arrived at Wusong Port the day before yesterday afternoon. As there was no vacant space at the docks inside the Huangpu River, it anchored outside the port to wait. According to the company, it will only be able to enter the port on the 16th. Roughly, docks 34 and 35 will be available for berthing. Furthermore, the King Egbert, also managed by Jardine Matheson, transported 7,750 tons of coal from Calcutta and is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Wednesday (the 19th). The Helga Moller (also managed by Jardine Matheson) transported 7,450 tons of coal from Calcutta and is expected to enter the port around the 20th. The three ships together carry 21,825 tons. (Zu)

### Imports and Exports: Large Quantities of Food Transported to South China

Tomorrow (the 17th), a large quantity of food will be transported to South China. This includes five hundred bags of flour to Weihaiwei, another six thousand bags, four hundred and seventy bags of beans, and ten cases of egg yolk and white to Xiamen. Goods transported to Hong Kong include one hundred bags of beans and twenty-eight cases of egg yolk and white.

### Adding Railings at Yu Garden to Prevent Drowning

Yu Garden in Shanghai, with its pavilions, terraces, and towers, has everything. It also has artificial hills of piled stones and ponds dug into the ground, with canals bringing in water to fill them, surrounding various places, and bridges are built to connect them. However, the ponds are deep and wide, and apart from the Nine-Bend Railing, the other areas are not built up. After the chaos of war, it is said that there are drowning ghosts in the ponds, often misleading passersby. It was not often seen in the past few years, but since the beginning of summer this year, it has happened several times. Two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, as the evening sun was setting, there were still many passersby; and in front of Cui Xiu Hall, the open space was wide and spacious. A storyteller who always performed there was just starting his performance, and no fewer than a hundred people were standing around listening. Suddenly, a man, not yet old, walked straight down towards Cui Xiu Hall, leisurely into the center of the water, then he was floating and sinking. Those who saw it knew that something was wrong and gathered the listeners to pull him out. They asked him why this happened, but he was confused and did not understand. Among them, someone who knew that he lived near the temple sent him home. The rest continued listening to the storyteller as before. Before half an hour had passed, another person... and people rescued him. After carefully asking the reason, the person was not rambling and said, "I heard someone calling my name in front of the Lakeside Pavilion, and I saw a road without water in the pond, so I went forward. I did not expect it to be a pond." The gentlemen of the former Smallpox Bureau donated funds to set up street lamps to guide passersby, precisely to prevent accidental drowning. All parts of the garden are managed by various guilds. Cui Xiu Hall is managed by the Bean Guild, Dian Chun is managed by the Flower Candy Guild, and the Inner Garden is managed by the Money Guild. There is also a newly built Wine Guild. There are also various guilds for cloth and grain, and there are also guilds for iron and other industries that make decisions. There are seven large guilds and several smaller ones. It is estimated that building railings will cost four hundred thousand "wen," so each guild will contribute no more than several tens of thousands of "wen." Each guild spends several hundred thousand "wen" on annual banquets each year. Now, if they slightly reduce their expenses, they can use this donation to build railings, which would save a life and be more virtuous than building a seven-story pagoda.

### Utilizing the Vacation to Experience Life

â Chen Liang

Looking around, the children are all enjoying their summer vacation. Summer vacation must feel pleasant for you; you no longer have to wipe the sweat from your brow while sucking on your brush in the classroom and writing dictation. You no longer have to stare wide-eyed at the difficult arithmetic problems on the blackboard, desperately trying to figure them out. The teachers no longer require you to hand in homework on time. In any case, you have temporarily escaped the constraints of school rules. You play freely at home, although your parents inevitably have to teach you some homework, writing, or reviewing. I think you will not be more afraid of your parents than of your teachers.

However, I strongly disapprove of you spending the entire summer vacation of several dozens of days playing. On the contrary, you can take advantage of this longer vacation to experience various aspects of life. Perhaps you will find it more interesting and beneficial than studying. For example, if your father is a mechanical engineer, you might ask him to take you to a machine factory to see what it's like. You will surely discover many mechanical wonders and the hard work of the workers. For example, if your father is the manager of a trading company, you can also ask to visit his office. You will easily find out how business is done and what kind of etiquette and skills a businessman must have. â¦ There are of course many other examples; there is no need to list them all.

Perhaps you will protest, "We are still in school, why should we do things outside of our duties?" This is completely the simple-minded and innocent tone of you children. But you must know that calling you to experience life is precisely to enable you to acquire various kinds of knowledge outside of books and to help you improve your studies. Books are just dead photographs, while real life is a moving picture. Children; moving pictures must be more interesting and understandable than dead photographs, right?

In conclusion, I would like to present an example: a friend of mine once worked as a proofreader in a newspaper office. Later, he entered a journalism school, and he did the best in the class in various papers because he wrote down all the experiences of working in the newspaper office. And other students can only circle around the scope of the books. Children, summer vacation is a good opportunity. Everyone, take advantage of it!

### American Children Learn to Use Chopsticks

â Ming Chu

A Chinese restaurant in New York's Chinatown recently held a luncheon for Chinese and American children, and many Chinese and foreigners also attended, creating a lively scene. This luncheon was part of the American Medical Aid to China sponsorship program. More than fifty children participated that day, all accompanied by their mothers, and they dispersed after two hours of enjoyment. According to Mrs. Zhu, who was in charge of the preparations, the luncheon had two purposes. First, it hoped to promote understanding and friendship between the Chinese and American people through this gathering. Second, all the proceeds would be used to purchase medical supplies and donate them to Chinese refugees to alleviate their suffering. Before the meal, Mrs. Zhu gave a brief speech, discussing Chinese culture and comparing American culture with Chinese culture, and then asked everyone present to donate a certain amount to show their support.

Of course, many American children were tasting Chinese food for the first time, and they all looked very curious when the waiters brought the dishes one after another. The food they ate included bird's nest chicken soup egg rolls, stir-fried vegetables with almond chicken, braised duck with chestnuts, shrimp egg, sweet and sour pork ribs, white rice, almond cookies, assorted fruits, and Chinese tea. What made these children most curious was the pair of long chopsticks. After an explanation, they either tapped the chopsticks on the table or made bridges and played other games before trying to use them to eat. Several Chinese children, like Mrs. Zhu, were also explaining the use of chopsticks to American children, but those American children tried and tried and never knew how to do it, so they had to imitate others and use them reluctantly. However, they soon used knives and forks again. There was also an American child who first used a fork to put the food on the chopsticks and then put it in his mouth. The Chinese and foreigners who attended this gathering were all very satisfied.

### Saying Earth

â Bai Zheng

ââMing Er's Refugee Record Twenty-Fiveââ

All the way passed Yangxi, Gangkou, and Chun'an, these are all towns and counties in Zhejiang, they have crossed countless rapids and shoals, like ten thousand horses galloping down, and then it is calm and still all the way! Three or five little crows chirped, and their clear singing seemed to comfort them for the hardships of wind and waves, and also seemed to sing praises for their victory. But good times don't last long. After a while, there was another roar of mountains and rivers cracking, and the poor Jiang's boats struggled in the heart of the river. Passing through shoal after shoal like this, the terrain became higher and higher. The boatmen fought the crazy waves with their solid bodies and strong courage, and finally defeated their limited brute force, but the price paid by the boatmen was also quite considerableâsweat all over their bodies. They travel back and forth across the river all year round, enduring the impact of wind, frost, rain and snow, and experiencing the journey of thousands of mountains and rivers. Such a life drifting on the water is really too hard.

"Is this river still the Xin'an River?" At this time, the Jiangshan boat passed another shoal. The boatman, covered in sweat, took off his clothes, leaving only an undershirt, and rested on the bow - of course, smoking. Ming'er strolled out of the cabin shrouded in a fearful atmosphere, took a long, turbid breath, and unknowingly chatted with the boatman.

"Yes, that's right, this is the Xin'an River." The boatman secretly felt a little disgusted by Ming'er's questioning, and answered loudly like a joke. But this is also not to blame Ming'er, because it was the first time he had passed through here. "Why are there so many shoals in this river?" Ming'er always liked to "break the casserole and ask to the end" and kept asking.

"Are you a student and don't know? Although I haven't studied, I understand very well that this is because the upper reaches are high. You see that there are high mountains all around, which is proof. How can the water not be rapid when it rushes down from a high place? And the Xin'an River is exactly in a slanted place, so there are many shoals. Speaking of which, I'll tell you an interesting thing: don't be surprised, the terrain here is higher than the three-story building in Hangzhou." The boatman also talked incessantly. Ming'er heard a long speech from the boatman like a lecture, and was very unconvinced in his heart, so he retorted:

"How do you know that the terrain here is higher than Hangzhou? You don't have a thousand-mile eye, how can you see Hangzhou?" "It's also easy to understand, you think, we have already passed more than a dozen shoals, and every time we pass a shoal, we rise about three or four feet, so if you calculate it, my words can be believed, right?" The boatman presented real evidence, which made Ming'er speechless. Fortunately, Ming'er's father came out of the cabin at this time. He didn't come to mediate, because he was sitting all day long and was really bored. Just when Ming'er and the boatman were arguing fiercely, he walked out of the cabin and interrupted their debate.

"Boatman, how many days will it take to get to Tunxi?" Ming'er's father asked the boatman. "Sir, it will take about four or five days. Tomorrow we can enter Anhui Province."

Ming'er took this opportunity to sneak into the cabin. He secretly thanked his father for giving him a time to step down. "Otherwise, what's the use? The boatman is not easy to mess with. I'm going to Anhui Province tomorrow. What's the difference between it and Jiangsu and Zhejiang? Ha, I'll see tomorrow!"

### "Changing Our New Clothes"

â Xiao Zuo

### From Coins to Paper Money

â Chun Lu

In the past, the currency circulating in our country was cast from two metals: silver and copper. There were four types of silver coins: one yuan, half yuan, double "jiao", and single "jiao"; there were two types of copper coins: ten copper yuan and one "wen" coins. However, exchanging copper coins for silver coins, or silver yuan for silver "jiao", could not be calculated in decimal terms. It had to be converted according to the market price, which was very troublesome.

In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, because the United States was buying silver, the price of silver was very high. Common greedy merchants transported the silver out to make money. In this way, there was less currency circulating in our country. When there is less currency, the prices of various goods fall, and the profits of industry and commerce also decrease, so many factories stopped work and shops closed. On November 4, our government implemented a new currency system: designating the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as "legal tender" for circulation. All cash was concentrated in the "Issuing Reserve Management Committee" and was not allowed to be used.

In addition to the aforementioned legal tender as the standard currency, on January 11 of the twenty-fifth year, the National Government also stipulated that nickel coins and copper coins should be used as subsidiary coins, all calculated decimally. There are now three types of nickel coins in circulation: twenty "fen", ten "fen", and five "fen"; there are two types of copper coins: one "fen" and half "fen". They are all cast by the Central Mint and issued by the Central Bank.

After the Anti-Japanese War, copper subsidiary coins almost disappeared from the market due to the invaders' plunder. At present, one legal tender yuan can only be exchanged for sixty to seventy subsidiary coins and is not easy to exchange. Therefore, the general public in the country all hope that the National Bank will issue a kind of "fen" denomination subsidiary currency, like the Zhejiang local bank currency issued by Zhejiang Province, which can be circulated nationwide. Then, our currency will completely change from coins to paper money, that is, from the period of using gold to the period of credit.

### Outer Mongolia

â By Tian

Outer Mongolia is located in the northern part of our country, geographically classified as the Mongolian Plateau. It covers a vast area, but most of it is a desolate Gobi Desert. Only the northern part has lush water and grass, and ample rainfall, making it very suitable for animal husbandry. Therefore, the greatest resource of Outer Mongolia is livestock. To the north of Outer Mongolia lies Russian Siberia. Due to Outer Mongolia's geographical proximity to Russia, the relationship between them is particularly complex.

Since the Russo-Japanese War, Russia's influence in the three northeastern provinces has been greatly weakened. Therefore, it had to find other targets for aggression, and Outer Mongolia, which was close at hand, caught its attention. In the year of the Xinhai Revolution, Russia took advantage of the chaos in the late Qing Dynasty and instructed the Living Buddha of Outer Mongolia to declare independence, calling it the Great Mongolian State. Russia then, under the pretext of assisting independence, signed a treaty with Outer Mongolia, obtaining various special privileges. Thus, Outer Mongolia became a dependency of Russia. After the establishment of the Republic of China, several negotiations with Russia yielded no results. It was not until 1915 that the Sino-Russian-Mongolian Agreement was signed, recognizing Outer Mongolia's autonomy, while Russia and Outer Mongolia recognized China's suzerainty over Outer Mongolia. The disputes between China, Russia, and Mongolia were temporarily resolved for several years. In 1917, the Russian Revolution broke out, and the Russians were unable to look eastward. Therefore, they stopped supporting the autonomous government of Outer Mongolia. At the same time, the invasion of the White Russians made the situation dangerous. Therefore, the Mongolian princes requested the Chinese government to provide protection. The government then sent troops to Outer Mongolia, and after the chaos was quelled, stationed troops in Kulun. At the same time, the Living Buddha and princes of Outer Mongolia realized the impracticality of autonomy, and in 1919, they voluntarily abolished autonomy and became a formal administrative region of our country. However, in 1921, Russian students in Outer Mongolia and a generation of ambitious princes formed an organization called the Mongolian People's Party, and with the support of Russia, they defeated Kulun, abolished the Living Buddha, and established the Mongolian People's Government. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was formally established, and all its political organizations and systems completely imitated Russia. Although Outer Mongolia nominally declared independence, all political, military, financial, and diplomatic powers were controlled by the Russians and subject to their domination. Thus, Outer Mongolia almost became a part of Russia again. However, Russia, fearing that this would harm the relations between China and Russia, signed a treaty with our country in the same year, again recognizing China's suzerainty over Outer Mongolia. Since then, Outer Mongolia has grown day by day under this semi-independent state, and all political affairs, military preparations, transportation, agriculture, industry, and commerce have advanced rapidly along with Russia. At the same time, Outer Mongolia has always maintained a friendly and sympathetic attitude towards its mother country, China, and has become an important bridge between China and Russia.

### Among the Beasts (9)

â Xin Qing

At that time, those beasts accompanied Peng Qi as they walked, and shouted, "Let's let him open his eyes and see our skills!" So a group of clever-eyed otters, with dark faces, as bright as Knox, immediately led Peng Qi to their dwelling place, to show him how to use their sharp teeth to cut down, or pick up the lumber floating on the water. It turned out that every spring, trees cut down in American forests were often thrown into the river, allowing them to flow downstream. The otters intercepted them, using their skills, and built dwellings one after another. While Peng Qi was visiting, a small water insect nearby also invited him to visit their dwelling. Although it was very small, it showed that they had also put in a lot of effort and were very skillful. All the walls were made of rubble, colorful and very beautiful.

In another small stream, there was a strong-looking small stickleback swimming around its barrel-shaped nest, acting as a guard. It proudly invited Peng Qi to visit their nest-building achievements.

After Peng Qi had seen it, his interest was attracted by the mud city built by the ants. He saw winding corridors, infinitely ingenious. He could not have imagined that such small creatures could achieve such miracles. In addition, he visited the rooms of the bumblebees and admired their diligence. At this moment, an invitation card was sent from an oyster shell on the seashore, inviting Peng Qi to visit the dwellings of the marine worms. The forms of these dwellings were each beautiful, but each different. Every family and every tribe had its own style. Although usually it was necessary to use a microscope to see them clearly, in this realm of beasts, it was only necessary to use the naked eye to see them clearly.

Soon, invitation cards flew in one after another. The sociable sandpipers invited him to visit their city in the distant woods. The field mice also welcomed him to their village. Every mouse sat on its small house, earnestly welcoming the distinguished guest. A flock of crows invited him to attend a solemn gathering. Sentries were placed on every tree, waiting for him to approach step by step.

A spider, like a clever and experienced mechanical engineer, was willing to show Peng Qi how to spin a web. He hurriedly said, "Listen carefully, for example, you are now ready for everything and are about to start working. First, you have to choose a suitable location and decide at which point to install your first thread. Of course, you have a ball of silk hidden in your body, don't you?"

### Ant War

â Cheng Ming

Among insects, what is good at group organization and good at warfare? It's ants. They are hardworking people under a public ownership system. Although their individual strength is weak, their collective strength surpasses everything. They also have a brave spirit of unity and resistance to foreign enemies. They are the most excellent and reasonable community dwellers. May the children take ants as a model for life. What about the ant's war situation? Rarely seen in records.

I remember that in the London Zoo, there was once a fierce ant war that lasted for four days and nights before the victory or defeat was determined. The audience was like a wall, and the newspapers also published the matter every day, causing a city-wide sensation. At that time, a naturalist, Sir Lubbock, witnessed it personally and recorded it in the most detail. Now, I will briefly record the general situation of the ant war as follows:

In the zoo, a tribe of ants had already lived by the stream. Later, a newly arrived tribe moved to the opposite bank. But the stream was separated, and there was no contact, so there was no reason for disputes. One day, a nosy gardener erected a wooden stick on the stream, so the ants of the two nests had the opportunity to come into contact.

At this time, it happened that an ant from the old nest was walking by the stream and saw the wooden stick. He went ashore along the wooden stick and was suddenly discovered by the ants of the new nest. He was surrounded, attacked, and killed, and could not survive.

When this bad news reached the old nest, there was an immediate commotion. Everyone ran around telling each other, and everyone showed an angry expression, but there was absolutely no disorderly behavior. After a while, more than ten brave and good fighters were sent across the bridge to spy on the enemy nest to find out the truth. At this time, the ants of the new nest all hid in their holes. The ants of the old nest could not find out the details, so they turned back to report. At this time, according to the observation of people, they must be holding a military meeting, right? A few minutes later, the entire warrior came out in single file, ready to cross the wooden stick and rush straight to the enemy's nest, with the ambition to "destroy this enemy before eating breakfast." At the same time, the worker ants carried sand along the way to act as a strategy for advancing and retreating.

At the other end of the wooden stick, two ants from the new nest were guarding. Seeing the enemy invading, one immediately ran back to report. A few seconds later, the entire team also came out. There were about several thousand soldiers on both sides.

As soon as the two armies came into contact, they bit with their mouths and resisted with their feet, fierce and unusual, fighting to seize and kill the enemy, advancing one after another. Some died on the battlefield with broken feet and necks; others were forced and drowned in the stream. After fighting for four days and nights, the ants of the old nest could not support and retreated. When they crossed the wooden stick, they were too crowded because the position was too narrow, and countless people fell into the water and died! After the war continued to the second day, there was a two-hour break in the middle, and the two sides exchanged messages. According to people's speculation, they were probably discussing the terms of the truce. Unfortunately, the peace talks failed, and the war started again.

Children, you see, they have marching plans and combat methods. What is the difference between them and humans? The ants of the old nest refused to surrender, it is really glorious even in defeat!

### Teasing Cool Tea

â Zi Xi

Undoubtedly, we are now in the hot summer season. Naturally, a few noble ladies can stroll into the cool and comfortable ice-drinking room and immerse themselves for a few hours. Anyway, they are members of the leisure class. Only the vast majority of toiling masses, for the sake of life, are running around all day long. Neither time nor economics allow them to immerse themselves in ice-drinking rooms. Therefore, there are some enthusiastic benefactors who, in order to reduce the thirst and heat of those toiling masses, have set up cool tea buckets along the road for free drinking, benefiting people. It's really not shallow, but recently there are often a few naughty children who not only do not do things that are beneficial to the people, but are doing rascally deeds that harm others and do not benefit themselves, such as often teasing the cool tea. Some use cool tea to wash their hands and faces; some use cool tea to sprinkle on people at will; some open the cool tea bucket switch and run away, letting it flow continuously on the ground; some three or five children use lead cans or the like to hold cool tea and fight each other; some use unclean cloth corners and paper heads to fill the switch openings, etc., all kinds of hateful naughty actions, and so on. In short: it is of no benefit to the teasers; it is of great harm to the users. This kind of fact is often seen. I would like to use the space of this publication to inform the readers of this publication, hoping that you will persuade them at any time and promote them in various ways, and strive to jointly maintain the original intention of giving cool tea to benefit the people. Anyway, teasing cool tea is a shameless act that harms others and does not benefit oneself, and it really hurts one's personality.

Spring and Autumn

### Please Hire Refugees First

â Xue Wen

Introduction Group of Refugee Relief Association

Currently, There are Various Technical Talents

and Will Add Civilian Factories

Training Class is Teaching Refugees

The broadcasting and charity sales for the summer hygiene funds for refugees these two days seem to be very lively, which shows that there are still many enthusiastic people in Shanghai. They are always able to spare a little energy to help the refugees in their comfortable environment.

But in addition to the passive "fundraising" and "donation" to keep tens of thousands of refugees in shelters, it does not seem to be a solution. Therefore, every refugee relief association in Shanghai has a production and education facility plan, hoping to enable refugees "without special skills" to learn a specialized skill in a short period of time under planned guidance.

But in fact, among the refugees, there are indeed those who have received middle and higher education in the past. For example, in the Western Allotment Road International Shelter, there are three university students; and in the office of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, there are also many staff members promoted from the refugees, which shows that there is no shortage of available talents in the shelters. If we can choose, they may be the most efficient workers.

Divided into Three Groups

In order to enable refugees to obtain a more stable life, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has specially established a job introduction group to register the specialized talents of each refugee and is responsible for introducing them to various factories.

Yesterday, the reporter went to the relief association at 93 Guangdong Road to visit their aftercare office. Chen ãMo, the director of the education department, talked with the reporter in detail about the organization process of the job introduction group and the current situation:

In order to make the refugees a direct producer, the relief association has specially established three groups: the first group is the job introduction group; the second group is the evacuation group; the third group is the production and construction group.

Let's put aside the second and third groups for the time being. Now let the reporter, based on Mr. Chen ãMo's conversation, focus on the "job introduction group."

Refugees Can Register

The job introduction group was established in November last year and has been established for half a year. When it was first registered, there were more than 2,000 people. Until now, more than 300 people have been introduced.

As soon as they were established, they formed a cooperative relationship with the industrial promotion department of the Ministry of Works and conducted them to various factories.

Their registration does not limit the refugees of the relief association. That is, if other shelters have refugees who claim to have specialized skills, they can go to the Guangdong Road Association to register

The registration procedure is very simple and does not charge any fees. Just fill out a form at the association.

This registration form is called "job application registration form." After the association receives the registration form, it conducts a survey in the shelter to see if the various facts filled in the form are true.

Monthly Allowance of One Yuan

After the investigation, a further assessment is carried out. The association sends staff to assess the registered refugees. If it is considered that the assessment is passed, the identity of this job-seeking refugee is confirmed after detailed notation on the assessment form.

If the job has been successfully introduced during this time, the association must first give various practical guidance and fill out a volunteer form.

Refugees with jobs are in a trial period for one to three months at the beginning. During this short period, the employer only provides food and accommodation without paying wages.

In order to reward refugees with jobs, the relief association specially subsidizes transportation costs of one yuan during the trial period. Although this one yuan is a small amount, the significance of this reward is worth promoting.

Must Intensify Training

According to the results of the statistics at the end of April last year. The number of registered people was 704, and the highest number in the statistics table was the male and female workers of the yarn factory, with 118 people. The second was the male and female workers of the cigarette factory, with 50 people. The rest were in order, with 40 peddlers, 33 printers, 31 store clerks, and others including coppersmiths, blacksmiths, cooks, and tailors. The smallest number was water workers, etc., the types cannot be said to be many.

From May to July, in these two months, the number of registered people was 226. The female workers of the yarn factory and the female workers of the tin foil factory were the most, one was 50 people and the other was 40 people. Others included 20 workers from the sock factory, 15 printing workers, and specialized technical talents, including one driver of a car and two male workers from the hinge factory. Although other private employees accounted for 80 people, they did not have special skills.

From these two statistical tables, the first statistical table can still show an average of various types of talents in the shelter, while the second statistical table shows that the refugees without a skill accounted for more than one-third. Therefore, for the current refugees, training must be intensified.

Establish Civilian Factories

According to my previous conversation with Mr. Chen and the statistical table showing that most of the job-seeking refugees do not have special skills, it has been decided to establish a large-scale civilian factory in the production and construction group, and it has been decided that Mr. Yu Zuoting and Mr. Xiang Kangyuan will be responsible for carrying it out. We hope that this plan can be realized quickly.

Secondly, under the education department, a work training group has also been established. Under this group, several specialized skill training classes have been opened, such as radio, soap, chemical engineering, etc., some of which graduate in one month, and some of which graduate in half a year. Although the first phase of these training classes has not yet graduated, under this orderly and planned process, it is much simpler for the refugees than any other method of education and production.

### Recent Works of Ms. Chen Keming

### Biographies of Female Storytellers

â Shen You

Female Storytellers Known for Their "Beauty"

At that time, there were also four people, namely Wang Youjuan, Xu Yayun, Huang Aiqing, and Chen Peiqing. Chi Pingsou commented: "Youjuan is the younger sister of Lijuan. Her talent is inferior to her sister, but her appearance is superior to her sister, and her art is equal to her sister. Xu Yayun is the daughter of Xu Baoyu. She is quiet, has a dignified appearance, speaks little, and has a girlish air. Her singing is also clear and melodious. Aiqing and Peiqing are both beautiful and have been married. Aiqing, I once saw her carrying a small bamboo tube of about an inch and playing with it, smiling sweetly, like a baby. She is innocent and romantic, and it is lovable. Peiqing is deeply in love and has a close alliance with Shi Sheng. Later, a wealthy person bought her, and her mother had already agreed. Shi Sheng cried, and Peiqing also cried. Her mother followed her will and finally returned the money and married Sheng." The matter of Peiqing described in the article is not exhaustive. The result of the development is actually a tragedy. "Hai Zou Ye You Fu Lu" records it in the most detail. The article says:

Peiqing's surname is Chen, and her first name is Xiaobao. She is intelligent and has a particularly beautiful appearance. Yao Ruilan in Tongqingli taught her songs, but Ji Yiran disdained to learn them... Jumeixuan outside Xiaodongmen, every July, all storytellers, regardless of gender, will meet here and perform a skill. If they do not attend the meeting, they will not be allowed to enter the storytelling field. Also, according to the precedent, the first to arrive will perform first, and the songs that have been performed shall not be sung again. Ji arrived the latest, and the books she had learned were all said by others first, and she almost had nothing to perform. She returned and devoted herself to music, and in less than two months, her art greatly improved and her name became famous. Among the famous flowers in Shanghai who have both beauty and talent, Ji should be the first. ...

This is about Peiqing's art, and her theory seems to be higher than that of Chi Pingsou, who only takes "beauty". As for her life experience, it is the same as that of Shi Sheng as described by Sou. However, Sou only describes the matter until Peiqing and Shi Sheng are combined. The subsequent development into a tragedy has not been mentioned, presumably because the article was completed earlier. "Hai Zou Ye You Suo Lu" continues to record:

... At first, it was thought that the harmony of the phoenixes was not suitable for Yunlu, and the shadow of the emeralds was not suitable for ãMing. In two years, she gave birth to two sons in a row, and people celebrated for her. However, the scholar was limitless, and his virtue was variable. Shi Sheng was outside and had an affair with Xu Xiaobao. He did not return for two months. Ji's face was full and her body was weak, standing tall like a hibiscus in the early sun. After giving birth, she was out of tune, and she was depressed. In a few months, the disease entered the bone marrow. She wanted to invite Shi Sheng to see her and say goodbye, but she could not get it. She called Shi Lang and said that he betrayed me and died. Shi Sheng returned, from which it can be known that his outline is that his personal history is a wonderful storytelling. The matter of Youjuan cannot be examined. Hanjiang Cike has a poem to her: "Youjuan is extremely intelligent, and her shallow smile and light frown are even more pitiful. Her weak body cannot bear too much thinness, and she should not stand in front of the wind." However, it is actually a general work. Mian Chi Daoren's "Jie Hong Xue Ci Ti Er Shi Si Nu Pin Hua Tu" (Shen Bao,) once compared her to "Begonia" and "Drunk Woman," and commented on her as "The silver candle shines on her cheeks, and Yu Huan wakes up with a dream like smoke." However, what he gave was still an ambiguous impression. Wang ãrecorded her sister Lijuan and said:

Lijuan's surname is Wang, and she grew up under Yushan Mountain. Her personality is idle and miscellaneous, and her demeanor is light and graceful. Her kind of Qing Jiao and unconventional outline is awe-inspiring and difficult to offend. ... Her register belongs to Qinchuan, the old family of Langya, and she also came here after being displaced by the war. She lost her mother when she was young, and her father did not engage in any business. An old woman named Ren took her to Shanghai, and she relied on her for washing and sewing. Living as a guest, she had no way to make a living, so she followed a teacher to learn songs and used them to make a living. ...

If Youjuan is really a sister to Lijuan, her experiences should be similar. Xu Yayun, Hanjiang Cike also has a poem for her, and it more clearly outlines her outline. The poem says: "Xu Yayun, with phoenix eyes and moth eyebrows, stands tall like a crane among chickens. Wu Niang's twilight rain Xiao Xiao song, I will hear it again when I return to Jiangnan." Her ãis also difficult to examine. "Hai Shang Qun Fang Pu" (1884) Volume II, there is a biography of Xu Yaxian, saying that Yaxian is a native of Gusu, with the original surname Zhu, a good family woman, who learned Southern lyrics from Xu Baoyu, so she followed the surname Xu. She has bright eyes and white teeth, smooth skin and soft bones, a plain face and light makeup, and her spirit is clear and her skin is clean, ãthe category of a national husband. ãI don't know if "Yaxian" is a changed name for "Yayun". Also, the author of "Ci Yuan Surname Record" Yun ãMeng ãFactory owner has "Jin Lu Qu Zeng Xu Qingyun Ci Shi Ci" saying:

The young phoenix is ââpetite, and when she watches the scene, her pearly throat and silvery nails sound wonderful. ãShe puts the golden hairpin into the treasure hairpin, and she is already working hard ã Yanxiao. What's more, her mother Xu Niang is not old, and she is good at Su Zhangkou in the literary world, and she is happy that there is a daughter ãat the same time. The tongue of the warbler turns, competing to steal cleverness. ãYunying used to be a shocking look, ãPipa Yingying's naive attitude, and her eyebrows are lightly swept (referring to her sister Yayun.) The sisters are not clear, and their distant mountains are as green as the Xiao. I also count the setbacks in the love field, and I am idle to evaluate the price in the dust (the recent compilation of the Ci Yuan surname record will be completed,) and add the fragrance name to the black silk manuscript. Throw the pen up, only long Xiao.

The words describe Yayun, which is quite similar to Yaxian. And from this, we can know that Yayun also has a younger sister, named Qingyun, who is also a lovable child. Huang Aiyun, in addition to Chi Pingsou's theory, there is nothing to be examined. "Shanghai Nan Bei Zhu Zhi Ci" said: "A song of Pipa tilts the four seats, and the beauty is also called Mr. Among them, who is the most outstanding? Wu Suqing and Huang Aiqing." I don't know if "Aiqing" is "Aiqing"? (Eight)

### The Soul Returns to Wuthering Heights

â Ru Hua

âWuthering Heightsâ

"The Soul Returns to Wuthering Heights" is a famous novel by the British female writer BrontÃ«. This heart-wrenching tragedy reflects the unbreakable class concepts of the time to a certain extent. On the other hand, it also illustrates that everyone should prioritize their own career. For example, Hindley, who had always despised Heathcliff since childhood, eventually sold his property to Heathcliff, who he had insulted, due to his own decline. However, Cathy's words, "Leave me, pursue your future," actually strengthened their passionate love. Heathcliff's later separation from Cathy was also out of resentment after being heartbroken. Therefore, what we see is naturally only a heart-wrenching tragedy.

"The Soul Returns to Wuthering Heights" uses the flashback method. I don't know if it's to be faithful to the original work, but I think this is not the best method in the film. This reduces the power of the final climax, and the explanations of each scene by the old woman Ellen also prevent the emotions of the entire play from being closely linked together.

Naturally, the achievements of the director William Wyler in handling each scene cannot be ignored. First: he grasped the personalities of Hindley and Heathcliff. One relies on his own position to look down on everything; the other endures all the pain for love, and only becomes perverted and willful when disappointed, which is written very vividly from beginning to end. Second: he wrote three scenes of Heathcliff and Cathy meeting on the mountain peaks, and wrote three different environments. The first time was the joy of their childhood fantasies, the second time was the comfort in pain, and the third time was even more passionate love, echoing each other and being deeply moving. Third: In the two scenes where Cathy chases Heathcliff in the heavy rain and the last scene where Cathy dies in Heathcliff's arms, his subtlety and touchingness should be the two most wonderful scenes in the entire film.

Merle Oberon's Cathy strives to tear her clothes, chase to the top of the mountain, run in the heavy rain, and die smiling on the sickbed. Laurence Olivier's Heathcliff can clearly grasp the personality of each changing period, his strength, patience, and willfulness.

Photography and music also contributed a lot. The former, such as the heavy wind and snow at the beginning, the gloom in the old house, the brightness of Cathy and Heathcliff harvesting wheat, and the loveliness of their old haunts in the depths of the white clouds at the end, are all vivid and lovely. The latter, such as the heavy thunderstorm when Heathcliff breaks his finger, strengthens Heathcliff's anger; the low music when Cathy is dying strengthens the desolate atmosphere.

### Chen Dieye Sells Paintings

â He Tianjian

Why is a scholar esteemed? The one who earns a living through his own labor is the highest, others are secondary. Why is a scholar esteemed? The one who successfully completes his career is the highest, others are secondary. Wealth or poverty is irrelevant, but the world exclusively values those with wealth and assets, regarding those who complete their careers and earn a living through their own labor without pursuing wealth as insignificant. Therefore, if one focuses on a single profession in the morning but cannot become wealthy, then by evening, he will change to another path to try to eliminate his poverty. Scholars do not specialize in learning, merchants do not specialize in commerce, artisans do not specialize in skills, and farmers do not specialize in farming. The common people are in a state of anxiety, unable to complete their daily tasks. This is a major drawback. Still, without realizing it, what can I say? There are those who have already completed their careers but have not yet made a living from it. Although they are different from those who change their minds from morning to evening, their results are inevitably plagued by a lack of specialization. Therefore, I say that the scholar who specializes in his career and earns a living through his own labor is the highest. Chen Dieye is an old friend of mine for ten years. He is skilled in landscape and flower paintings but does not earn a living from his art. He was inspired by my words. He asked me for advice on what to do. I said, "Do what suits you." So, a price list was set: each fan leaf is fifteen yuan, each foot of a screen panel is ten yuan, a hanging scroll is double that, and a vertical scroll is fifteen yuan. This is not an excessive price. Regarding the value of paintings, the ancient times valued them more than the present. When Zhao Mingcheng saw Xu Xi's painting, he asked for a price of two hundred thousand qian, and still said it was cheap. A painting by Li Yingqiu was valued at one million. Today's painting prices are several tens of yuan per foot, and the world is already surprised. How different is that? It can be seen from this that painters are not valued today. However, painting is essential to the culture of a country. The world does not value it. For what reason? We need not discuss it for now. Those who specialize in this matter need not take this into account either, but simply pursue their goals and complete their careers. Chen Zi has already taken this as his mission, and his self-cultivation and adherence to his principles are commendable. Chen Zi, in landscape painting, strongly upholds the idea of the Yuan people, so his brushwork is ancient, vigorous, unrestrained, and lofty, possessing the excellence of Zi Jiu, Ze Min, Shan Qiao, and Fang Hu. Si Weng and Shi Xi are his forerunners in entering the Yuan style. In flower painting, he has gained the divine essence of Bai Yang and Bada. Chen Zi has traveled through the famous mountains and great rivers of the country eight or nine times, with over ten thousand books in his mind. His temperament is extraordinary, which is not accidental. When he initially announced his price list and requested paintings, I would like to serve as a go-between.

### Why is Peking Opera Not Considered Opera?

â Xun Mo

I approve of "Westernization," but I do not advocate "complete" Westernization; I also approve of promoting Chinese native culture, but I do not advocate conservatism and adherence to convention. The culture of a country should not be isolated, but it cannot lose its unique character. Friends who are in favor of Westernization should simply be asked to go abroad, and elders who are bound by tradition should only be asked to go to museums. My view of Peking Opera has always been like this.

Some people do not allow Chinese Peking Opera to be included in the world's opera scene. Those who insist on this view will cite many Western theories to criticize Peking Opera to the point that it cannot be ranked. However, I cannot help but have doubts.

In terms of singing, Peking Opera's pronunciation, articulation, phrasing, and modulation, its intonation and tempo, not only have strict rules and regulations, but must also sing out the flavor within the strict rules and regulations. Why can't its value be found in music theory? Why must one straighten the voice like singing a foreign song, with a quiver in the straightness? There is really no reason to say why. A few years ago, I heard Mr. Du Tingxi use a singing method that conformed to the principles of vocal music, which to the layman sounded like singing a foreign song, to sing a section of "Empty City Stratagem" ("I was originally..."). I beg your pardon for saying this impolitely, but I really couldn't find some of the inherent flavor of Peking Opera. This is really superfluous.

In terms of dance, Peking Opera's postures, steps, every hand gesture, and every foot movement also have strict rules and regulations, and changes must be made within the strict rules and regulations. Why can't its value be found in dance theory? Why must one kick one's legs, bend one's arms, and spin one's body like dancing a foreign dance? There is really no reason to say why. Peking Opera emphasizes body movements and styles, which means conforming to standards and being beautiful. As for the water hair, beards, water sleeves, thick boots, and various different and difficult techniques such as stilt walking, why is none of them worth mentioning?

In terms of musical accompaniment, Peking Opera's stage is simple and not as complex as Western opera. However, it also has its unique style. Taking the huqin as an example, two strings can produce various tunes, setting off the different singing styles of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. Why are those who play the violin called musicians, while those who play the huqin are reduced to "teachers"? This kind of mentality is truly the epitome of self-contempt. Furthermore, the small gong, big gong, cymbals, and gongs, whether played solo or in ensemble, set off the various moods in the play. Why are they all without merit?

In terms of action and expression, in Peking Opera, from babies to the elderly, from emperors to civilians, from civil officials to military generals, from noble ladies to jade-like girls, each has its own merits. Those with superb acting skills, every frown, every smile, every word, and every move all have their norms, and all conform to reason and emotion. For example, the performance of a young female character expressing longing for spring is no less inferior to the most passionate love performance in foreign operas (please note: kissing and hugging in foreign operas are considered lewd and prohibited in Chinese society). Must one shout "I love you" with a trembling voice like in foreign operas to pass the test?

As for stage decorations and makeup costumes, if Chinese drama and foreign drama do not have to be exactly the same, then I still say that they have their own unique styles and even more so their own social backgrounds. Due to space limitations, I cannot discuss this in detail here. For example, the techniques of martial arts dramas, I ask, have you seen the flexible and rigid performances of foreign technical troupes? Putting one's hand on one's heart, are the Chinese ones inferior to the foreign ones?

Peking Opera is a Chinese folk art. We do not deny that it is still very immature and needs to be improved based on its inherent rules and regulations and in line with the trends of the times. I absolutely admit and advocate this. To say that Peking Opera has no value and should not be included in the world's opera scene, then I firmly protest and firmly oppose it.

Why is Peking Opera not considered opera?

### Quick News from the Liyuan in the Old Capital

â Yan Yan

Ping Opera's famous Dan actress, Xi Xingyun, who has the reputation of being an artist of the era, has been gaining popularity since her performance in Ping. Her new play "Liang Hongyu and Han Shizhong" has been a sensation for a long time, and people in Ping are also eager to feast their eyes and ears. According to reports, this play has been rehearsed for a long time, and the reason for the delay in its public performance is that the production of three-dimensional scenery was delayed, the tailoring of archaeological costumes was overdue, and the singing and acting of the supporting cast had not yet been mastered. Recently, it premiered at the New New Theater, and the seats were full. All those who came were well-known people of the time. It was truly unexpected that Xi Cailian would be so popular.

Cheng Jixian, the Taidou of Laosheng in Ludian Yiguang, has not performed for a long time since leaving Cheng Yanqiu's Qiu Sheng Troupe. There have been rumors of his comeback for some time. It was not until the evening of the 10th of this month that he performed "Linjiang Hui" with Li Hongchun at the Chang'an Theater. Before the play, there was Yang Baosen and Wang Quankui's "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," Zhu Guifang, Li Zhijiang, and Fan Baoting's "Qingshi Mountain," and Yu Lianxian's "Hezhu Pei." It is said that the attendance was still good. Given Cheng Jixian's age, it is no small feat to still form a troupe and perform. His old age is also not shallow.

Meng Xiaodong, the Kunling Xusheng, has been immersed in Zen and seclusion since apprenticing to Yu Shuyan, and has not performed for a long time. Now I hear that she is thinking of moving after being still for a long time and will perform in the near future. This matter is already in sight and will likely become a reality. The location is at the New New Theater, but the repertoire has not yet been determined.

The dignitaries of Ping City once again invited the famous Jing Jin Shaoshan to cooperate with Xi Xiaobo and Zhang Junqiu to perform a play. The repertoire is tentatively set as "Entering the Palace Twice," to be performed at the New New Theater on the 13th of this month. The front scene will feature Song Dezhu, Zhou Ruian, Tong Dexin, and others in "Pan Si Dong." Song will play the Spider Demon Yuexia Fairy, which will be a surprising move.

The Thirteenth Sister of the famous Dan Xun Huisheng has long been famous. Tongchang plays He Yufeng. Nai Zilingxiang learned this play from Wang Yaoqing and also plays He Yufeng. Therefore, some people asked his father and son to perform together. It was staged on the 10th of this month at the Jixiang Night Theater, with Lingxiang playing the Thirteenth Sister in the first scene and Zhang Jinfeng in the second scene. Huisheng played the Thirteenth Sister in the second scene, Jin Zhongren played An Xuehai, Jiang Shao Kui played Deng Jiugong, and Zhu Binxian played Sai Xishi.

After the play, "Six Kingdoms Conferring Prime Ministers," which was personally supported by Gao Shengkui in the past, achieved good results after its public performance and was deeply welcomed by the people of Ping. The second part has also been rehearsed and was performed on the 9th of this month at the Guanghe Painting Workshop, with Li Hezeng still playing Zhang Yi and Zhao Jinnian playing Su Qin. The plot and costumes are even more wonderful than the first part. Also, after Li Hongchun and Ding Yongli resigned from the drama school one after another, all the martial arts dramas that the students should learn are now taught by Fu Dewei and Wang Jinlu.

### Yang Xiaozhong Adapts "Tragedy on the Lake"

â Yin Di

Tian Han's Famous Work of the Past Brought to the Screen

In the past, there was a famous drama performed in Nanguo Society, which was "Tragedy on the Lake" written by Tian Han. Later, Bu Wancang brought it to the screen at the Star Film Company, which seemed to be "Spring Dream by the Lake" starring Yang Naimei.

Now Yang Xiaozhong has also taken a fancy to this play by Tian Han and is working on adapting it into a movie script. It is said that the simple story has been reviewed and approved by the Xinhua Company. After Yang Xiaozhong's new work "The Pipa Story" is filmed, he plans to start filming this film, tentatively titled "Qian NÃ¼ You Hun," but the words "You Hun" (wandering soul) are not very appropriate, so it may be changed to "Qian NÃ¼ Li Hun" (Qian NÃ¼'s Soul Leaving Her Body).

Yang Xiaozhong intends to invite Chen Yunshang to play the heroine in this film. Chen Yunshang was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around the 15th, but now it has been "postponed due to some matter." She is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 23rd or 24th.

### One of Qilin Tong's Masterpieces â Beating Yan Song

â Feng Zongying

Xin Fang's signature masterpieces are Shanghai-style plays, such as "Chasing Han Xin," "Qingfeng Pavilion," "Farewell Kiln," "Road Distant Knows Horsepower," and "Sweeping Pines and Lowering Books," which have always been known for their excellence. All of these plays require a lot of physical work, while the singing is secondary. I recall that a few years ago, I watched one of Xin Fang's masterpieces, "Beating Yan Song," and I am bringing it up again specifically.

In the play "Beating Yan Song," Xin Fang's Ying Long, paired with Shao Shan's Yan Song, has the beauty of red and green complementing each other. Xin Fang's dialogue is clear and refreshing, slow and methodical, and every word is articulated very accurately. As for the lines "Jiajing Ye, sitting on the throne...", when singing, there is absolutely no intermingling of florid embellishments, unlike Lian Liang's "Handsome Student," which uses florid embellishments to win the audience's applause. However, it is a pity that his voice is sandy and hoarse, but the sandiness has strength and authenticity, which is also excellent. When Ying Long goes to Yan Mansion and interacts with the doorman, both his acting and dialogue are excellent, and there are many cheers. However, Wu Bao's doorman's hoarse and low voice is not as fluent and smooth as those of Fu Lu and Chang Hua. After entering the mansion, he bows and pays respects with "One salute under the East Corner Gate, one bow under the West Corner Gate..." When singing the lines "...Standing on the steps of the palace, answer me if I ask," he walks to the edge of the stage, his cheeks flushed, his eyes wide with anger, his face full of scolding, his hands inserted behind his back, his robe corners raised, standing still like a truly angry person. In the section of the imperial decree on the throne with the second and sixth beat, he sings the whole section in one breath, especially the three words "Ba, ba, ba," the sound suddenly high and low, with varying degrees of emphasis, like cutting water with a knife, the sound suspended and stopped, making the audience below applaud like thunder. Shao Shan's dialogue has a lot of nasal sounds, and in the singing, the phrase "Three, six, nine days..." has a particularly fast transition. His golden voice is loud and clear, worthy of the sound of a great bell! Later, when opening the mountain mansion and beating Yan Song, the dialogue between Xin Fang and Shao Shan is smooth and refreshing to the point of perfection. When beating Yan Song, Shao Shan's being beaten seems to be unintentional, authentic, and Xin Fang's angry actions seem to truly vent his anger and repay past grudges, reaching the climax of the plot. When the play ends and the curtain closes, the Grand Tutor uses a small voice to say "Thank you" to Ying Long in the Shanghai dialect, which causes a burst of laughter from the audience.

Now Shao Shan is extremely popular in the north, and Xin Fang remains in Shanghai to perform various long plays. When will the two be able to perform together again? How many times will we be able to encounter such a great play? Thinking about it, I feel deeply moved.

### Skating Technique (82)

â Compiled by Lian Jun Qi Zhen

One of the practice methods is to first move backward with both feet on the ground, and gradually lift one foot while moving, so that the moving foot exerts force on the outside of the shoe. Another practice method is to use the backward circular method. For example, when retreating to the right, cross the left foot in front of the right foot and to the right of the right foot, and make it land on the inside of the left shoe when landing. Rotate the center of gravity of the body left and right alternately. If the left foot uses the inside and the right foot uses the outside, the speed will increase. Practice until the right foot can travel independently.

4.  Inward Retreat

Stabilize the left foot, lift the right foot, the toes must be inward, and the heel should be as outward as possible. The left knee should be greatly bent, with a slight elastic force when pushing. At the same time, the right foot should land immediately and must land directly on the inside of the shoe. With practice, the left foot can naturally leave the ground lightly and gently. The buttocks must rotate together with the main leg and main shoulder. The opening step of inward retreat is inherently not very elegant, but if the guest knee can be greatly bent and have elastic force, it can also make it elegant.

In the first position of the body during inward retreat, the guest leg, guest arm, and guest shoulder follow the direction of the arc, and the guest leg is on the arc, while the main shoulder remains behind. Both shoulders start from the waist and are slightly outside the circle, and the head faces the main shoulder and the direction of movement.

From the beginning of the body's rotation to the second position, about halfway, the guest leg and guest buttocks are behind, and the shoulder remains the same. The head is now facing the center. When changing feet, the shoulder turns and passes the axis, and the right shoulder moves to the front. This method can make the body's position the same as when the right foot opens when the left foot opens. The main knee must always be greatly bent, especially before opening the step, so that it can be powerful. The above uses the first and second positions of the body. In the third position, the main shoulder and guest leg are in front of the body, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are behind. The head looks at the direction from which it came. This position is used after inward advance and swing. In the fourth position, the guest shoulder, arm, leg, and buttocks are all behind, and the head is facing the direction of movement and is inside the circle. Advanced skating such as (A) before the inward retreat reverse three-character turn, (B) after the outward advance three-character turn, and (C) after the inward retreat loop are all used.

There is also a method for opening the step of inward retreat, that is, using the inside of the right shoe, first cross it in front of the left foot and push, and then push the outside of the left shoe, which is the so-called crossing-foot method. According to this method, the main foot pushes first, which violates the rule that the opening step must start from a fixed position, so it is not allowed in competitions, but it is extremely useful for skating at ordinary times, because it can borrow a lot of force.

The inward retreat practice can be completely carried out according to the outward retreat method, that is, (A) retreating with both feet on the ground, (B) using the circular method, but not lifting the left foot but lifting the right foot, and using the inside of the left shoe to move. When the guest foot passes the main foot, if the main foot is straightened with force, the speed can be increased.

### News from the Performing Arts

China-France Drama Society: The China-France Drama Society, hosted by the China-France Drama School, held a trial performance of its first public performance of "The True Story of Ah Q" the night before (the 14th) and invited people from all walks of life. It officially opened yesterday. It is reported that about 700 people from the literary, drama, film, and news circles attended the trial performance. The society's director, Feng Zhizhong, first gave a speech, and then the opening began, which did not end until 12 o'clock, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic, but the sixth act of the play was not performed due to the lateness of the hour.

Green Field Drama Troupe: The Green Field Drama Troupe at No. 405 Tianjin Road is an amateur organization of people who love drama and strongly advocate dramatic arts. It held its first public performance at the Xianle Grand Theater on the 18th of last month, and the results were very good. Recently, it was heard that the troupe will hold its second performance and plans to recruit male and female members in order to expand its organization and seek the development of drama affairs. Therefore, anyone who can speak Mandarin and loves dramatic arts is requested to bring a photo and register at Huaying Elementary School (at the intersection of Aiwenyi Road and Dahua Road) within three days from 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm every day.

### Anecdotes from Liyuan

â Xu Muyun

Xu Biyun Violates Liyuan's White Tiger Taboo

Therefore, everyone at the time was talking about it, saying that Biyun's failure was due to the three white tigers. In fact, this is all superstition. In recent years, Liang Huating took over Zhonghe and signed a long-term contract with Yanqiu. As long as he performs in Beiping, Zhonghe will enjoy the patent. Yanqiu returned to China from France, and his reputation soared. Coincidentally, Lanfang lived far away at sea, so the Dan performance in Beiping seemed to be led by him. The seat price was sold to 1.7 yuan, and the business was booming, which invisibly benefited Liang Huating greatly. Yanqiu, since returning from overseas, has a fresh mind and certainly does not shy away from any white tigers or black tigers. However, Liang's adventurous attempt shows that he is also very courageous. Now it is said that he has made a profit of more than 100,000 yuan, and he is a well-off family. On the other hand, Xu Lao Si has become destitute. In recent years, apart from being able to gain a foothold in Guanwai, the people of Ping City have simply forgotten his name. Xu Lao Si is not as good as Cheng Lao Si after all. The success or failure of a career depends entirely on whether the individual is progressive, and this has nothing to do with the White Tiger Terrace.

The Long Headgear Used by Dan Roles Was Created by Mei Qiaoling

Lanfang's grandfather, Mei Qiaoling, was a Dan actor and master of ceremonies at the same time as Boss Cheng (Changgeng). He was humble in his dealings with people and had superb skills. At that time, famous Dan actors such as Shi Xiaofu and Yu Ziyun were all his students. Mei was particularly fond of participating in charitable undertakings in his life, and his accumulated virtue may be unmatched in the Liyuan world, both ancient and modern. Last year, I briefly described a glimpse of his life's affairs in an article titled "Dr. Mei Does Not Know His Father's Name." At the time, some people criticized me for not playing this joke on the doctor. In fact, they did not understand the meaning of the article. Although the title was a bit peculiar, the article always praised Mei's three generations for their kindness in dealing with people, and repeatedly explained that Lanfang did not know his father's name because his father died too early and he was raised by his uncle since childhood. Moreover, I have known Wanhua for more than ten years and have never had any grievances, so how could I have malicious intentions? If all the articles I write every day are in a solemn tone, that would be a bit boring, so sometimes I use a humorous tone to make adjustments, which is also a last resort. (60)

### Chess Garden

Opening Method, 53rd Game

Black First

Central Cannon vs. Screen Horse, Continuation of the Previous Game

Pawn 7 Advances 1, Change, Cannon 8 Moves to 5, Pawn 3 Advances 1, Chariot 9 Moves to 8

Explanation: The Central Cannon is intended to attack the central route. Cannon 8 Advances 3 is intended to take the central pawn, open the way. Pawn 3 Advances 1 is a change of tactics by Red. If Black advances Pawn 7 to remove the pawn, then Red can advance Pawn 5 over the river, which can restrain the horse route of the cannon side.

Cannon 8 Moves to 5 is the correct move. Pawn 3 Advances 1 captures the horse. Although Red now has a pawn crossing the river, it is actually not very dangerous. Chariot 9 Moves to 8 captures the cannon with the initiative.

According to this month's opening method, we will focus on the various changes of Horse 3 Advances 4 and Cannon 8 Advances 3. Horse 3 Advances 4 is an old-school move and seems to be inappropriate. The new method mostly uses Cannon 2 Advances 1 to protect the pawn, so that the cannon side cannot use Chariot 2 Moves to 3 to take the initiative to suppress the horse. This is the Screen Horse method.

### A New Type of Dance Hall Will Appear Near the Metropolis â Vienna

â Xingzhe

Near the west end of the Metropolis on Jing'an Temple Road, at the intersection of Seymour Road, inside a seven-story building, a new type of dance hall is being designed and built by the famous Hongda Foreign Firm, named "Xilimen Dance Hall."

Hongda Foreign Firm is a famous architect in Shanghai. Many of the major theaters and many famous tall buildings in Shanghai were designed by Hongda Foreign Firm. For example, the newly completed "Ping An" and "Du Mei" theaters are also newly designed buildings of the firm.

The entire decoration of the "Xilimen Dance Hall" is luxurious and magnificent. The entire venue uses spring seats, which are extremely comfortable. It is now being built day and night and will be opened soon. In the future, the "Metropolis," "Vienna," and "Xilimen," the three major dance venues on Jing'an Temple Road, will be like the "Wing On," "Sincere," and "Sun Sun" on Nanjing Road, standing tall and facing each other from afar.

Rerelease of "Farmer's Song": The new comedy film "Farmer's Song," which depicts the collective farm life of the Soviet Union, was screened at the Huguang Theater last month and was very popular among the general audience. Several new songs in it, such as "Farmer's Song" and "Fire Train March," are exciting and majestic and are even more popular among people who love singing. It is now heard that these songs have become popular in the city. It is heard that Asia Film Company and Du Mei Theater have reached an agreement to rerun it for a few days starting from the 16th of this month.
