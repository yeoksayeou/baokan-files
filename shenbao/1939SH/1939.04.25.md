### Fierce Fighting Around Linfen; Japanese Casualties Nearly 1,000; Railway Between Hongdong and Huoxian Completely Destroyed; Chinese Forces in Luohan Move to Yuanxigou to Meet the Enemy

Xingji: At 2:00 PM on the 21st, eight or nine hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry, accompanied by six cannons, advanced west from Xinzhishitan ("south of Huoxian") and Zhao City in separate routes. A certain Chinese unit blocked the Japanese advance on the highlands east of Zhongcun. Fierce fighting continued until evening, when the Chinese army retreated slightly westward. On the morning of the 22nd, Chinese reinforcements arrived. One part launched a counter-attack from the front, while two parts of fresh troops combined forces to attack the flanks.

Editorial

### Aggression and Anti-Aggression

A Reuters diplomatic reporter reported: "The heat of the international flames shows no signs of cooling." This sentence precisely summarizes the seriousness of the current international situation. Yes, history has reached a period of sudden change, and the world is in a vortex of re-division. Intimidation, shouting, roaring, wailing: mixed into a chaotic sound, blackmail, concessions, maneuvering, and scheming, interwoven into a bewildering picture.

However, in this complex situation, we also see the increasingly clear division of international fronts. On the one hand, the arrogance of the aggression front is increasing, and on the other hand, the democratic countries of the peace front are gradually solidifying. There is no third way. Even like British Prime Minister Chamberlain, although he has not yet given up the illusion of compromising with aggressors, objective circumstances are finally forcing him to organize an anti-aggression front, and to "shift the wine barrel and seek instruction," to win over the Soviet Union and connect small countries… In a word, he has to return to the road of collective security — of course, due to the consistent vacillation of the British attitude, there is still a considerable distance from the realization of collective security.

Recent international developments all demonstrate the struggle between the two forces of aggression and anti-aggression. President Roosevelt's warning to Germany and Italy, Hull's strong protest to Japan, and the return of the American fleet to the Pacific indicate that the United States, one of the pillars of the peace front, is providing great support to the collective security movement called for by Britain; the signing of the Anglo-Turkish agreement and the approaching Anglo-Soviet negotiations indicate that the collective security system is gradually evolving. The above factors can all be said to be clear evidence of the progress of the anti-aggression peace front. On the other hand, under the pressure of the peace front becoming increasingly solidified, the countries of the aggression front are also carrying out diplomatic offensives. First, Hitler tried every means to threaten and lure Britain to prevent her from approaching the Soviet Union; at the same time, he carried out large-scale diplomatic activities to try to win over Hungary and other small countries. Second, Italy also tried its best to collude with Yugoslavia and attempted to pull Yugoslavia out of the League of Nations and into the "Anti-Communist" Pact. Third, Japan, fearing that collective security would expand to the Far East, even instigated its government-controlled newspapers to carry out an anti-British movement to threaten and lure Britain, and to echo Germany and Italy.

From the above facts, it can be seen that as the aggression forces intensify their attacks, the anti-aggression forces are also developing step by step, and collective security is gradually evolving.

Peace is indivisible, and collective security cannot be limited to Europe, but must also extend to the Far East. Twenty-two months of resistance have proved that China is standing on the front line of anti-aggression and is a pillar of the peace front. She is fighting not only for her own survival, but also for world peace. China's resistance is completely in line with the interests of the countries of the peace front — Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, etc. It should receive the sympathy and assistance of all countries of the peace front!

### Red Star Newspaper Discusses the Victory of the Chinese Army's Counter-Offensive; The Chinese Army Has Gained the Initiative; High Fighting Power Inflicts Heavy Damage on the Japanese

(Moscow) The Red Star Newspaper commented on the recent Sino-Japanese war situation, saying, "After occupying Nanchang and Guling, Japan originally thought that the fighting power of the Chinese army would be hit and the anti-Japanese national united front would be shaken. However, subsequent facts have proved that the fighting power of the Chinese army has not only not weakened, but has even advanced to carry out active activities on a very long front. The fighting situation in the past ten days has proved that the Chinese army has gained the initiative on all fronts and has made considerable progress. As of April 20, the Japanese army has been forced to withdraw from more than 70 counties and towns."

"The active activities of the Chinese army have shown its high fighting power and the firmness of its moral and political will, proving that China is determined to resist to the end until it achieves final victory." The newspaper concluded, "We can now assert that the Japanese army has been defeated in several battlefields, and the situation of the Chinese army has improved a lot, and its high fighting power has also been demonstrated."

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Yunnan Through Annam; France Issues Warning

(Chongqing) When Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed Mengzi, Yunnan, on the 13th of this month, the Euro-Asia Company's 19th squid postal aircraft happened to be attacked by Japanese aircraft in the air 10 kilometers east of Bac-Kan in Vietnam. It has been found that the Japanese aircraft took off from Tuanzhou Island in Tokyo Bay, intruded into French Indochina airspace after entering Guangxi's Zhennanguan, and flew directly into Yunnan Province, China, indiscriminately bombing Mengzi, where the Chinese side had no defenses. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believed that it was illegal for Japanese aircraft to invade the territory of Vietnam, a third country, to achieve the purpose of bombing Chinese cities, and immediately urged the French side to pay attention and take necessary steps to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents. It is reported that the French side is also deeply indignant at the Japanese aircraft's invasion of Vietnamese territory and has issued a warning to the Japanese side, prohibiting such transgressive actions from happening again.

### Canadian Aid-China Committee Convenes Pacific Northwest Conference; Prohibition of Transporting Military Supplies to Japan; Chairman Chiang and His Wife Send Telegrams of Congratulations

(Chongqing) The Vancouver Aid-China Committee and the Medical Supplies Donation Aid-China Committee in Canada specially convened the "Pacific Northwest Conference" there on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. Its purpose is to unite all circles in Washington, Canada, Columbia State, and Liler Bank (located on the Pacific coast, one of the northwestern states) to implement a movement to prohibit the transportation of military supplies from Pacific ports to Japan. Chairman Chiang and Madam Chiang specially sent a telegram to the conference to congratulate them. The telegram is translated as follows: "We hereby, on behalf of the Chinese nation, congratulate your conference and hope that the movement advocated by your conference to prohibit the transportation of military supplies from Pacific ports to Japan will be successful. If all democratic powers can decide on a policy sooner to deny the brutal acts of strong countries invading weak neighbors, then China will not be ravaged, the credibility of Western countries in Asia will not be overturned, the independent sovereignty of small countries in the Commonwealth will not be tragically deprived, and the world will not suffer such a disaster that threatens human safety as it does today. Aiding China and weakening Japan is also aiding democratic countries and maintaining their independence and peace. Conversely, continuing to aid Japan with military supplies, allowing it to use this to invade China, is tantamount to sowing the seeds of disaster everywhere in the world, allowing them to grow to destroy human freedom and culture."

### Outline of Wartime Propaganda Made by the Military Affairs Commission

(Chongqing) Wartime – "namely, Guerrilla Zone" – Outline of Propaganda, made and issued by the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, April of the 28th year of the Republic (1939).

The Importance of Propaganda

A. The necessity of wartime propaganda work lies in the second phase of the War of Resistance. Wartime political propaganda work is even more important than the frontline and the rear, for the following reasons:

(1) In the vast areas "occupied" by the Japanese bandits, what the enemy can truly occupy are only a few large cities, a few transportation lines, and some military strongholds. The rest of the country is under our control. (Statistics on wartime county administration from the Executive Yuan in February of this year indicated that: (A) out of 941 counties in the war zones of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Fujian, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, only 55 county magistrates could not exercise their functions; (B) parts of 25 counties were occupied, but the county magistrates still resided in the county seats and exercised their functions; (C) the county seats of 245 counties had fallen, and the county magistrates had moved to the countryside to work; (D) 23 county magistrates had moved to neighboring counties but were still able to exercise their functions). At the same time, we have established many anti-Japanese base areas in these vast areas, left behind many regular troops, and organized many guerrilla forces, whose activities range from six or seven counties to dozens of counties. Therefore, the minister instructed our party and government personnel and revolutionary cadres, those in the enemy's rear areas, should remain in the enemy's rear. At the same time, the entire nation should regard the enemy's rear as an important target for our revolutionary work.

(2) The enemy's strategy of military aggression originally aimed to use military force as a means to achieve its goal of economic plunder. It also used politics as a means to cover up the facts of its military aggression. The enemy everywhere instigated Chinese traitors to establish puppet organizations, and at the same time used Chinese traitors to create various names of robber companies to carry out their plunder. This is a concrete manifestation of this conspiracy. In response to the enemy's secret conspiracy, we must use military force to cover the political offensive and use politics to assist military victory. To carry out this countermeasure, wartime political propaganda work needs to bear a greater task.

(3) In the second phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy's strategy of "quick victory" and the political strategy of "quick peace" have both failed. They are caught in a dilemma, unable to advance or retreat, and are in a desperate situation where their forces are insufficient and their finances are exhausted. They have to issue the mournful cries of "long-term war" and the slogan of "long-term construction." The so-called "long-term construction" is actually "long-term war," which is an attempt to use the manpower and material resources of our war zones as capital for further aggression against China. According to recent intelligence, the enemy is stepping up its assistance to the construction of the puppet "New China Government," (A) consolidating the occupied areas, actively reorganizing and cultivating vitality, and at a minimum must be able to supply the needs of the enemy's expeditionary forces in China; (B) extensively cultivating land in the areas of Dachang, Zhenru, and Nanxiang, and Jiangnan area, and moving Japanese people to cultivate it; (C) the enemy's "Sino-Japanese Cooperation" factories are subject to the control of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, in order to meet the needs of the long-term war against China, and to imitate the Soviet Union's Far Eastern Military District approach. We must strike at the enemy's delusion, first by ensuring that the enemy cannot plunder resources or train puppet troops in the war zones. This task largely falls on the shoulders of wartime political workers, who must extensively and deeply enter the enemy's rear, launch guerrilla warfare, consolidate revolutionary regimes in various places, destroy the enemy's transportation, and obstruct all of the enemy's political, economic, and cultural facilities, so that the enemy is exhausted and surrounded and beaten by our revolutionary forces, until they collapse (Minister Chen's words).

(4) The characteristic of the second phase of the War of Resistance is the transition from defense to offense and from defeat to victory. On the one hand, we must stop the enemy's advance, and on the other hand, we must prepare our total counter-offensive force to strive for final victory. Therefore, wartime political work must intensify the mobilization of the masses, develop guerrilla warfare, and contain and disperse the enemy's greater forces, so that they are unable and unwilling to boldly attack. At the same time, we must prepare more battle-experienced troops in the enemy's rear and unite more conscious people, so that they can be used to attack the enemy from both sides and cut off the enemy's retreat during the general counter-offensive in the future. (5) The war zone is in the enemy's rear, and can be threatened and attacked by the enemy at any time, and it is often difficult to obtain supplies from our rear. Therefore, we must intensify political propaganda work to raise the national consciousness and spirit of sacrifice of the wartime troops and people. We must "infinitely raise" the importance of political work in order to accomplish this sacred and great task. (To be continued tomorrow) (Dispatch from the 24th)

### Final News (Refer to Local News in This Edition)

Last night, just after 9:00 p.m., there was a collision between a Japanese public bus and a private car near Broadway Road. It is now known that the private car was driven by Mr. Li Li, the principal of Lester Industrial School, with his wife sitting next to him, and Mr. Wimsett, a head constable of the Public Concession, sitting in the back. After the accident, an ambulance arrived and rushed the three to the Country Hospital. By the time they arrived at the hospital, Mr. Li Li had already died. His wife and the head constable were both seriously injured, but their lives were not in danger. It is said that Mr. Li Li was a Bachelor of Science from the University of London, a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and one of the most famous educators in the Far East. He came to Shanghai in 1933 to work, and recently returned to China to hire a mathematics professor for the school. He stayed for two months and had just arrived in Shanghai yesterday on a certain postal ship when he suffered this tragedy. Everyone who heard about it lamented. The bad news was not told to his wife last night. It is said that after the Country Hospital admitted Mr. Li Li and the other two last night, an accident also occurred. A Japanese military officer, accompanied by two soldiers with rifles, arrived at the hospital and insisted on entering the room where the dead and wounded were placed to take a look. He spoke to Superintendent Samson in Japanese. Because Samson did not understand him, he did not answer immediately. The Japanese officer punched Samson below his right ear and pushed him out of the hospital. Samson did not argue with him. When he saw that the Japanese officer was threatening people again, he took the opportunity to leave the hospital and went to the Hongkou Police Station.

### Diplomatic Counter-Offensive by Germany and Italy, Striving to Alienate the Balkan Countries, Yugoslavia and Romania are Hesitating, Chamberlain Declares Britain is Negotiating with Russia and Turkey

(London) Among the international situations, there are three matters that are most valued by the newspapers here, namely (1) the talks between Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and the British authorities; (2) the sudden return of British Ambassador to Germany Henderson; and (3) the diplomatic counter-offensive of the Berlin-Rome Axis. Regarding the first item, all newspapers said that if Britain does not provide Romania with economic assistance, it will not be able to resist Germany's eastward expansion policy. The Daily Telegraph reported that Britain should provide Romania with various conveniences in trade. This move is not only sufficient to directly assist the country, but also indirectly influence the policies of other countries in the Balkan Pact, namely Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece. These countries are in a difficult situation and are currently undecided. Their future choices depend on the results obtained by Foreign Minister Gafencu in London. Regarding the second item, although all newspapers have expressed surprise, the official has not made any explanation on this matter, so whether this move is appropriate is debated. However, the Financial Times reported, "The return of Ambassador Henderson should not be seen as any new development in the relationship between Britain and Germany, nor does he bear any new mission." Regarding the third item, the Manchester Guardian reported that the goal of Germany and Italy at the moment is to jointly control the Balkan Peninsula, and Yugoslavia is the first to bear the brunt, so they are luring and threatening these countries to maintain so-called neutrality, which is actually siding with the Rome-Berlin Axis, so that the axis countries' warships can use the ports of the southern countries, their army troops can use the railways of the southern countries, and their aircraft can use the airspace of the southern countries, that's all. "If the southern countries can obtain guarantees from other countries, they will naturally resist the harsh demands of Germany and Italy. It is a pity that Western European countries have never taken concrete action to strengthen the courage of the southern countries to resist, which has led to Germany and Italy taking whatever they want," he said. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)

(Berlin) The Axis powers are now preparing a second dose of inducement medicine to await the arrival of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister is scheduled to come here on April 26. Officials have high hopes for him. Germany's plan to increase the close relationship with the Balkan countries is now gradually adopting the form of "resisting the encirclement group." Political circles here believe that Hungary and Bulgaria can join the Axis side, while the southern country is still undecided, so special efforts are being made to win over the southern country. Roughly speaking, Germany will declare to Marković that Germany will give full assistance to Italy's Adriatic Sea interests. Germany may even raise the issue of the German minorities in Yugoslavia in the same form as Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic, so that the Yugoslav Foreign Minister is aware. According to the opinions of all sectors of Yugoslavs here, Marković will try his best to maintain neutrality and not be subject to any restrictions. (Reuter's dispatch from the 24th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the British government is now maintaining close contact with other governments, including Turkey and the Soviet Union, but he has not been able to add anything to his previous remarks. (Reuter's dispatch from the 24th)

### Diplomacy Among Britain, France, and Germany Gradually Returns to Normal, British Ambassador to Germany Has Returned, French and German Envoys Will Follow Suit

(London) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned to his post in Berlin yesterday afternoon. Although people initially expected that the ambassador would not return before May, he suddenly returned immediately. According to well-informed sources, this has no political significance. It is heard that French Ambassador to Germany Coulondre will also return to his post from Paris in two or three days. (Reuter's dispatch from the 23rd)

(London) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson was summoned back to his country on March 19, that is, after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia. It has been more than a month. He returned to his post in Berlin at 2:00 p.m. today. A certain political figure commented that the British government has once again taken appeasement actions to prevent Germany from pulling back, and adopted a negotiating approach instead of intimidation. However, Britain's intensified expansion of its military and the organization of collective security to prevent aggression will not be relaxed in the slightest. This is what others say, that is, the recall of Ambassador Henderson in the past was to condemn Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Now that the government has decided to organize a peace group in Europe in order to solve the problem once and for all, then temporary measures such as recalling the ambassador are no longer necessary. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to opposition leader Attlee in the House of Commons today, that the return of British Ambassador Henderson has no special significance. The ambassador was recently summoned back to the country to report on his work. After the matter was completed, he asked for a short leave. After the leave expired, he returned to his post as usual. Attlee continued to ask whether the ambassador's return meant that the government had recognized Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. The Prime Minister replied that there was definitely no such intention, and there was no reason for it. (Reuter's dispatch from the 24th)

(London) German Ambassador to Britain Dirksen will soon set off to return to his post in London. (Reuter's dispatch from the 24th)

(Paris) French Ambassador to Germany Coulondre, who was summoned back to the country in March of this year after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, is said to be returning to his post in a short period of time. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)

### Britain Implements the Conscription Issue, France Urges Strongly

(London) The conscription issue seems to be presented at the cabinet meeting tomorrow, at which time a memorandum on this matter will be distributed to the cabinet members, but there is no hope of an immediate decision. The cabinet will also listen to Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon's budget tomorrow. Regarding this matter, people are afraid that income tax will be increased. (Reuter's dispatch from the 23rd)

(London) Regarding the issue of whether Britain should implement a conscription system, the government should make a decision in a short period of time. The newspapers have been commenting on this matter. Among them, The Times reported, "Most cabinet members admit that if Britain can establish the principle of compulsory military service, it will be more powerful in organizing an anti-aggression group. This view is not only in the cabinet, but also in general public opinion." The Financial Times reported, "When the cabinet meets today, in addition to discussing the budget for the next year, it will also discuss the conscription system based on the report submitted by Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha. It is heard that the Secretary of State for War has already drafted a plan to fully implement national compulsory military training." (Havas dispatch from the 24th)

(London) Conservative right-wing leader Churchill recently gave a speech at the London City Hall, advocating that the current national voluntary service system should be changed to a compulsory system. The audience applauded in agreement. Churchill said, "Domestic public opinion is increasingly in favor of implementing compulsory service, which is a phenomenon that can be seen. Therefore, this system can be seen in practice in a short period of time. As far as I know, the personnel of each department required for the voluntary service system have been filled, and the second batch of personnel has begun training. Considering the complexity of the current system, it is not bad to achieve such results." At this point, Britain has accepted the constraints from a certain country in Europe. "Since Britain has offered promises, it should train a strong army as a backing." But the thinness of the current strength of the army is laughed at by the enemy and chills the hearts of relatives, and it also delays the progress of the organization of a group of peace-loving countries because of this concern. It is necessary to know that the collective military strength of each country is the greatest guarantee of peace. If this group cannot be established in one day, the foundation of peace will not be laid in one day." (Havas dispatch from the 24th)

(Paris) British Ambassador to France Phipps met with the French Prime Minister this morning, and visited French Foreign Minister Bonnet in the afternoon. According to The Times, this is related to Britain's implementation of the conscription system. British Prime Minister Chamberlain has now realized that he must change his original means. Based on experience, he has expressed that he does not have the strength to negotiate on an equal footing, because engaging in peace and engaging in war are no different. The great powers must have sufficient strength to implement their policies. (Reuter's dispatch from the 23rd)

### British Naval Exercises in the Mediterranean

(London) The London newspapers this morning reported that the British Mediterranean Fleet will sail from Malta on the 26th to the Eastern Mediterranean for exercises. A total of thirty-two ships will participate in the exercises, including one 30,600-ton battleship and two 31,000-ton battleships. The fleet is commanded by Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham. The official calls this exercise a "legitimate special cruise." (Haitong dispatch from the 23rd)

Malta According to an official announcement, several warships of the Mediterranean Fleet are scheduled to cruise the eastern Mediterranean starting on Wednesday, including the battleship Ramillies, the cruiser Sussex, the aircraft carrier Glorious, and three destroyer squadrons. (Reuter's dispatch from the 23rd)

### German Newspaper Reveals Hitler's Attitude, Claiming to Have Broken Through the Policy of Encirclement

(Berlin) Fuehrer Hitler is scheduled to give a speech in the Reichstag on the 28th of this month, responding to US President Roosevelt. But the Danziger Vorposten recently published an article, commenting on it, saying, "The mediation attempt made by a certain overseas country is actually to accuse our country of being the first aggressor when war breaks out in the future. The German side should resolutely reject this despicable strategy. It can be asserted that Fuehrer Hitler should also formally tell the Western European democracies that peace is not an empty formula, but a vigorous undertaking. It is necessary to gradually find fair solutions to various problems. Our country is a powerful country based on racism, and its position is clear and it will never retreat one step, but it also has no delusion of pursuing an adventurous policy. In addition, since a delegation from Turkey recently came here to congratulate Fuehrer Hitler and took the opportunity to hold talks with Fuehrer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the friendship between the two sides has been confirmed. The German government's appointment of Papen as ambassador to Turkey is also an excellent proof." (Havas dispatch from the 24th)

(Berlin) Regarding the anti-aggression group, the talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have been commented on by newspapers here, all of which have taken the opportunity to attack Bolshevism, and predict that Fuehrer Hitler will give a speech in the Reichstag on the 28th of this month to respond to US President Roosevelt, and will develop the answers from the various small countries that have been obtained, that is, each country has not been threatened by Germany. It is said among political figures that "the struggle has begun." Even if the Berlin-Rome Axis' attempt to divide the Balkan Pact countries has not been as successful as expected, but seeing politicians from these countries visiting Berlin one after another, it is clear that Germany has won a victory over the "encirclement policy" pursued by Britain. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)

### Romanian Foreign Minister Begins Talks with Britain, Germany Prepares to Guarantee Romania's Security to Prevent Joining Anti-Aggression Bloc

(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu began talks with British authorities today. He met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax in the morning and with Prime Minister Chamberlain at the British Parliament in the afternoon. The Romanian Foreign Minister was accompanied by two secretaries, but no commercial experts. Commercial discussions between Britain and Romania will begin on April 25 in the Romanian capital. The British Lees-Ross Commission is expected to arrive in the Romanian capital today. It is not yet known whether Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will speak with British businessman Stanley. The date of the formal meeting has not yet been decided. (Reuters, 24th)

(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, after discussing matters with the Romanian Ambassador to France, Titulescu, in Paris last night, arrived here at 5:20 PM today. He was greeted at Folkestone by the Romanian Minister to Britain, Tilea. British Foreign Secretary Halifax also welcomed him at the station. The Polish and Turkish Ambassadors, the Greek Minister, and staff from the Romanian Embassy in Britain were also present. Gafencu will meet with the British Foreign Secretary tomorrow morning and with Prime Minister Chamberlain in the afternoon. It is expected that Gafencu will report on Romania's contacts with Turkey, Poland, and the Balkan countries, as well as Germany's attitude. Germany's theory is that Romania does not need to join the anti-aggression bloc because, after joining hands with the Soviet Union, Romania will fear the Soviet Union even more than Germany. Germany is now preparing to guarantee Romania's borders, just as Britain is doing, but on the condition that Romania does not enter into an agreement with Britain. (Reuters, 23rd)

(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is about to arrive here to conduct important talks with British authorities. Official circles here attach great importance to this move, believing that whether Romania will actually join the anti-aggression bloc initiated by Britain and France, or intensify its ties with the Rome-Berlin Axis countries, will be decided in these talks. Romania urgently needs to increase its export trade, so the crux of the issue lies in the economic sphere. It is reported that Britain intends to promote trade with Romania within the scope of the existing agreement. In other words, it intends to purchase food from Romania and sell it domestically produced munitions. The reason why Sir Lees-Ross, the government's economic advisor, is leading a delegation to the Romanian capital to conduct business talks is probably for this reason. According to Romanian sources here, whether British-Romanian business relations can develop is a matter of great urgency. Since Germany signed a supplementary commercial agreement with Romania, it has been actively engaged in economic activities in Romania. There are several facts to prove this: German and Romanian businessmen have recently jointly established a company with a capital of £3,000,000, intending to monopolize the grain trade produced in Romania; a German Ministry of Economy expert, Walter, is leading a number of German technicians to conduct inspections in the Romanian capital; German businessmen have recently purchased smaller oil mines owned by Romanian Jews, whose oil production accounts for about 13% of Romania's total oil production. Under these circumstances, observers believe that the British government should do everything possible to promote business relations with Romania, ensuring that the oil produced in the country does not come under German control. If the business talks between Britain and Romania can achieve initial success, the political talks between the two sides can also proceed smoothly. These political talks will cover the following areas: (1) Romania and the Soviet Union should adjust their relations in accordance with the anti-aggression bloc's program; (2) The Balkan Entente should be maintained and strengthened, and the attitude of Yugoslavia should also be discussed; (3) How should Romania and Poland respond if Hungary attacks Romania or Poland; (4) How to strengthen the relationship between Romania and Turkey, in other words, how Turkey can immediately provide assistance if Romania is invaded in the future. All these issues will be mentioned by Foreign Minister Gafencu during his talks with British authorities. In addition, Foreign Minister Gafencu will go to Paris afterwards to inform the French government of the results of the talks. (Havas, 23rd)

Romanian Capital: Since Italy has been striving to reconcile Yugoslavia with Hungary and Bulgaria, political figures here are extremely concerned. They believe that the Balkan Entente between Romania and Yugoslavia to counter Bulgaria's territorial claims, and the Little Entente with Yugoslavia to counter Hungary's territorial aspirations, will henceforth be meaningless. Since Italy's annexation of Albania, the pressure it has put on Yugoslavia has been more than the country can resist on its own, and it may lose its freedom of action. When Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the Romanian government, fearing that Hungary would take the opportunity to attack, asked Yugoslavia what its attitude would be. At that time, the Yugoslav government did not give a clear answer. The recent rapprochement between Italy and Yugoslavia further confirms that Yugoslavia's attitude has changed. At this moment, although Turkey and Greece still maintain friendly relations with Romania, it is not enough to cope with the current threats. It is hoped that the Western European countries will intensify their efforts to counter Italy's activities and ensure that the Balkan Peninsula's "status quo" is respected, which would be fortunate for Romania.

### Why Are the British Ambassadors to China and Japan in Shanghai? Discussed in the British House of Commons, Said to Be Comparing Records

(London) Communist Member of Parliament Gallacher asked in the House of Commons today what British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and British Ambassador to China Kerr recently discussed when they met in Shanghai. Under-Secretary Butler replied that Craigie's trip to Shanghai was primarily to spend a short vacation and to take this opportunity to compare records of several matters of common concern with Ambassador Kerr. Sir Kerr is now proceeding to the location of the Chinese government in accordance with normal procedures to conduct official business. The meeting between the two ambassadors had no special significance. Gallacher continued, asking whether the Under-Secretary was prepared to express an opinion on assisting the heroic Chinese resistance. Butler replied that the government's general attitude on this matter was well known and did not need to be elaborated. (Reuters, 24th)

### Manchester Aids China, Donating More Than Just Bandages

(London) The Manchester China Relief Committee met today. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Quo Tai-chi delivered a speech, stating that within another year, regardless of whether there is an international war, there will be signs of a peaceful resolution to the Far East. There are four reasons for this: (1) European and American countries are now gradually resisting the fact of aggression. President Roosevelt's dispatch of the American fleet to the Pacific is one proof; (2) When Prime Minister Chamberlain initiates the organization of the anti-aggression bloc, he will not forget the promise to China; (3) The Japanese people are gradually becoming weary of war, but the Japanese warlords are still unwilling to give up their conspiracy to conquer China; (4) The Chinese people are continuing to redouble their efforts to resist. Thomson, Secretary of the British China Relief Fund, said that there are many wounded soldiers entering and leaving the battlefield. He had requested a donation of 50,000 field bandages by the end of April. Manchester donated 17,000 bandages, and now the full amount has been raised. He is now raising another 50,000 bandages. (Reuters, 24th)

### The Tokyo Newspaper Attacks America, Saying the Fleet's Transfer to the Pacific Only Increases the Seriousness of the Situation

(Tokyo) Yesterday, the Hochi Shimbun warned the United States that the United States' transfer of its fleet to the Pacific was tantamount to interfering with Japan's plan to develop southwards. The newspaper also believed that the United States' move was a "threat to Japan." The newspaper said, "How much the United States attaches importance to Japan's southward policy and how much the United States hopes to prevent it has become very clear. But if the United States thinks that moving its fleet to the Pacific is enough to contain Japan's actions, it is a very wrong idea. Not only will this not ease the situation, but it will increase its seriousness. We deeply regret that the United States is gradually increasing its provocative actions." (Associated Press, 24th)

### Three Giants of the Japanese Financial World Oppose a Military Alliance with Germany and Italy, Advocate a Cautious Diplomatic Policy, and Friction Arises with Junior Military Officers

(Tokyo) At present, the three financiers are the most powerful. All three hold positions in the current cabinet, but their close relationship with the Emperor is closer than that of any behind-the-scenes faction. Who are these three people? (1) Shigebin Ikeda, who studied economics in the United States, once served as the Governor of the Bank of Japan and the Minister of Finance, and has close ties with Mitsui; (2) Yūki Toyotarō, who also studied economics in the United States, is the current Governor of the Bank of Japan; (3) Gō Seinosuke, who studied economics in Europe and the United States, previously served as the President of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and has close ties with Mitsubishi, and is currently the Chairman of the Japan Economic Federation. These three people have a controlling influence on the Hiranuma Cabinet. If the Hiranuma Cabinet exists for a day, they will be able to use their power to keep it on a cautious track. The Japanese military is naturally very unhappy with the policy of financial control. Junior military officers who are ignorant of economics believe that as long as public bonds are continuously issued, there will be no problems with the war against China, so they all oppose these financiers. As for older and more cautious military officers, they know that their grasp of victory in the war is extremely limited, so they can only accept the control of these three people. All three financiers have been educated in Europe and the United States, and their background in this regard has a great relationship with their thoughts and views. The reason why they oppose the military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy may be due to their educational background. Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa Kurahei deeply sympathizes with the three's view that they should not collude with totalitarian countries, but should maintain considerable cooperation with Britain and the United States. At the same time, all three firmly believe that Japan should conserve its national strength and adopt a more cautious policy internationally. According to sources here, the current Minister of the Army Itagaki is now regarded in the army as a cautious faction rather than a reckless and radical one. What is most surprising is that Araki, who in 1932 advocated that "the spirit of Japan should be expanded to the five continents and seven oceans, even resorting to force if necessary," now also opposes joining the anti-democratic military group. At least junior military officers are still plotting to overthrow the "liberals" in the conservative army, and many have been squeezed to unimportant positions. At the same time, there are many who have been promoted to important positions by them. Koiso Kuniaki's appointment as the current Minister of Colonial Affairs is the power of the junior faction, and was once regarded as a victory for the junior faction. However, according to news obtained by the Associated Press, Koiso's ideas are actually the same as Ugaki's. When Ugaki was Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was dismissed from his post by the military for attempting to maintain a cooperative attitude with third countries, because the power of the Japanese military was stronger at that time than it is now. It is said that Koiso also opposes joining the anti-democratic military front of European dictatorships. As for other political leaders, many also believe that "strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact" should be limited to the exchange of arms manufacturing and trade, and should not involve military aspects.

### America's Silver Purchase Policy is Beneficial to China, the Time Limit Will Be Extended

Havas News Agency's New York Air Communication: The current American silver law will expire on June 30 this year, and Congress may slightly amend it and extend its validity. Since the implementation of the silver purchase policy on July 1, 1934, it has been quite unfavorable to China's monetary system. Until the beginning of November 1935, the Chinese government lowered the value of its currency, nationalized silver, and entered into an agreement with the United States to exchange it for gold and store it in the United States. After this agreement expired, Chen Guangfu, a Chinese banker, recently renewed it with the American financial authorities, so that he could continue to exchange silver for gold to purchase the goods necessary for China's survival. This shows that the silver purchase policy in its current form is extremely beneficial to China. If it is amended, it will inevitably have a direct impact on China, and Japan, which has sold large quantities of silver to the United States in the past four years, will also be affected. Whether the American silver purchase policy is beneficial is a question that is often discussed. For example, Townsend, a Republican senator from Delaware, submitted a draft resolution to the Senate at the beginning of this session of Congress, stating that the silver purchase law is not very beneficial and whether its validity should be extended should be investigated by Congress. This proves that there are quite a few people who oppose this policy.

From July 1, 1934, to June 30, 1938, the US government purchased a total of 1,712,093,266 ounces of silver in accordance with the silver purchase law, of which only 13%, or 219,353,029 ounces, was produced domestically. From July 1, 1938, to December 31, it purchased another 200,000,000 ounces. It is generally estimated that about 1,650,000,000 ounces came from abroad, part of which was transshipped to the United States from London. The exact source is not easy to verify, but it can be asserted that the vast majority came from China and Japan in the Far East (including the occupied areas of China). Although Japan's silver production is not very high, it has benefited greatly from the US silver purchase policy. Its output in 1933 was only 5,967,000 ounces, but last year it increased to 10,000,000 ounces. As for its silver exports, in 1933 it was only 7,682,248 ounces, but in 1935 it increased to 225,401,505 ounces. It is estimated that the silver that the country has found or seized in China and "Manchukuo" has been completely transported to the United States. In the future, if Japan can seize the remaining silver in China (estimated by American experts to be more than 2,000,000,000 ounces), it will definitely sell it in large quantities. Otherwise, China can still use its silver reserves to purchase munitions from the United States within the scope of the American silver purchase policy, according to the Sino-American gold and silver exchange agreement. The United States was originally a major exporter of silver, exporting 43,275,000 ounces in 1933. In 1935, one year after the implementation of the silver purchase law, it decreased to 5,279,468 ounces. In 1937, it decreased again to 2,093,435 ounces. During this period, China and India, which were originally major importers of silver, were transformed into exporters.

Critics of the current silver policy say that it has failed to make silver a monetary metal, but has instead deprived it of its monetary properties. Whether this move is wise is questionable. Countries have sold their silver reserves to the United States at low prices, and those who previously hoped that silver would become an important currency again have been disappointed. Those who support the current policy say that this policy is sufficient to raise prices, but in reality, its impact is very limited. To date, the amount of national currency spent by the United States on purchasing silver has been considerable, but the price level has only slightly increased compared to the early days of the silver policy. The silver law stipulates that the US paper currency reserve should reach a ratio of three parts gold to one part silver. When it began to be implemented in 1934, the government should have purchased 1,333,000,000 ounces of silver. As of today, the amount of gold held by the United States has greatly increased compared to four and a half years ago. In addition to the silver already purchased, another 1,100,000,000 ounces must be purchased to meet the gold to silver ratio of three to one. Congress is strongly opposed to this. If an investigation is conducted in the future, the current policy may be changed.

### Grand Wedding of the Iranian Crown Prince and the Egyptian Princess

Iranian Capital: The wedding of the Iranian Crown Prince and Egyptian Princess Fawzia is being celebrated here for four days, starting yesterday. Tuesday will be the most lively day. On that day, the Iranian King will give two specially built palaces to the couple. The palaces are made of high-priced stones and marble. One is for the personal residence of the bride. The Iranian and Egyptian flags and gorgeous lanterns are hung here, and triumphal arches are built, like a city in a fairyland. The buildings are decorated with noble Iranian carpets and tapestries. At night, the whole city is brightly lit, like daytime. A grand banquet was held in the palace last night. Among the distinguished guests were Earl of Athlone, aide-de-camp to King George VI of England. Today, boy and girl scouts will perform in front of the Iranian and Egyptian royal families. Tomorrow, the Speaker of Parliament will hold a tea party in the garden of the Parliament Building. In the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also host a banquet for guests. On Tuesday, the Egyptian Ambassador will host a banquet for Princess Fawzia, followed by a performance by the Iranian Air Force, followed by a review of the troops. A detachment of British naval soldiers will also participate, and then it will be followed by a horse race. (Reuters, 23rd)

### The Japanese Five Ministers Convene a Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures to the European Situation

(Tokyo) According to an official gazette published here last night, the Japanese "Five Ministers Emergency Meeting" yesterday had a very detailed discussion on the European situation and the attitude that Japan should adopt. Before the meeting, Minister of the Army Itagaki visited Prime Minister Hiranuma and had a long conversation. After the meeting, authoritative figures from the Army and Navy Departments held a meeting to discuss various issues related to the European situation. (Haitong, 24th)

### The French Minister of Construction Visits Poland to Ease the Gap with Russia, the Commander-in-Chief of the Estonian Army Contacts the Polish Authorities and Returns Home

(Paris) Well-informed sources here believe that French Minister of Construction Monzie's visit to Warsaw is a further step in French foreign policy, not only to enhance political relations between the two countries, but also to strengthen economic links. Foreign Minister Bonnet's conversation with Polish Ambassador Lukasiewicz this morning also has the same significance. Political figures say that Monzie is a friend of Polish Foreign Minister Beck, and this personal visit will try to resolve Poland's prejudice against participating in the Anglo-Soviet Sky Agreement. (Haitong, 24th)

Warsaw: The city of Katowice in the Silesian province of Poland is a coal-producing area and a metallurgical center. A French-Polish joint venture company began constructing a railway eight years ago, from that place to the port of Gdynia on the Baltic Sea. From south to north, passing through eastern Poland, it can directly transport coal and iron ore produced in the Silesian province to the coast, without having to go through the Free City of Danzig. The last section of the route (belonging to the Polish government and operated by a French-Polish joint venture company) has been completed. Recently, French Minister of Public Works Termonzie and Polish Minister of Transport Ulrych jointly presided over the opening ceremony. Ulrych delivered a speech, stating that the economic cooperation between France and Poland has always been close, and will be further enhanced in the future. Termonzie then delivered a speech, saying, "I came to your country this time not to give any advice, let alone to engage in agitation, but there is something I cannot help but say, that France is located on the side of your country, so it is today, and so it will be tomorrow. The two countries are interdependent and no one can provoke discord between them." (Havas, 23rd)

Warsaw: General Laidoner, Commander-in-Chief of the Estonian Army, has been visiting Poland for a week and has recently returned home. Before leaving, he gave a speech to the Polish newspapers, saying that after talking with General Smigly-Rydz, Director of Military Education of the Polish Army, and Colonel Beck, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he saw the closeness of the relations between the two countries, because "both countries are in danger and are interdependent. There is no need to establish an agreement in words or in writing to express this form of interdependence." (Havas, 24th)

### Italy and Yugoslavia Negotiate and Establish a New Agreement

(London) According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, London regards the communiqué of the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in Venice as another sign of progress in the friendship between Italy and Yugoslavia. According to the opinions of foreign observers, Yugoslavia believes that the pressure from the Rome-Berlin Axis is more powerful than the guarantees of countries that are further away. Italy also has interests in the Adriatic Sea, so it has to maintain a friendly attitude towards it, but the Yugoslav people all hate Germany and Italy. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Paris) Italy and Yugoslavia did not sign any new agreement in the talks held in Venice this time, which is of great interest here. It is generally believed that Yugoslavia is still hesitant to accept the guarantees of the Berlin-Rome Axis. It is said that this guarantee includes the withdrawal of Hungary's demands on Yugoslavia. If Yugoslavia accepts Italy's proposal to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, reorganize its army under Italian-German supervision, and conclude a commercial agreement with Italy, then Italy originally guaranteed that Yugoslavia would not be invaded by Italy and Germany. (Reuters, 24th)

Hungarian Capital: After Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Venice, Italy yesterday, a communiqué was jointly issued, reiterating the friendship between the two countries and declaring that "the path to an understanding between the South and Hungary has been opened as a result of this conversation." Political figures here attach great importance to this and say that after Foreign Minister Marković and Foreign Minister Csáky of this country visit Germany in succession, the South-Hungarian governments can decide on various concrete measures to realize this understanding. Representatives may be sent to hold formal meetings. (Havas, 23rd)

### International Anti-Aggression Games Correcting England, America, and France Chongqing Air Mail

U.S. and Chinese Legislation No Different Than Aiding the Wicked British Prestige Declines Daily After German Annexation of Czechoslovakia

Thirty-One American Organizations Advocate Revising Neutrality Law

The Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League recently received an air message from the United States, detailing the attitude of the American public towards revising the Neutrality Act. Seven religious organizations, such as the World Alliance for International Friendship Through Churches, seven women's organizations, such as the Association of University Women, twelve labor organizations, such as the Iron Workers Committee, and five peace organizations, such as the National Council for Prevention of War, a total of thirty-one organizations, have all resolved to advocate revising the Neutrality Act. It is necessary to distinguish between aggressor and victim, and the embargo on arms and raw materials should only be applied to aggressor nations. Dr. Shotwell of Columbia University, speaking at Carnegie Hall in New York, criticized the Neutrality Act, saying that it not only failed to distinguish between aggressor and victim, but also often aided the wicked and hurt friends as a result. Bishop Oldham of Albany, at a speech organized by the National Council for Prevention of War, also believed that "the Neutrality Act is the result of the nervous breakdown or suspicion and fear of American political leaders of the past. In this era of increasingly close interdependence throughout the world, speaking of isolation is suspected of insincerity."

Sir Cecil Issues Declaration Against German Annexation of Czechoslovakia

According to the Chinese branch of the Anti-Aggression League, League President Sir Cecil recently issued a declaration on the Czech question. "The final destruction of Czechoslovakia has aroused praise from the German and Italian official newspapers, which see it as a natural result of the 'Munich' surrender. This time they are right. Due to the Munich Agreement, Czechoslovakia has been disarmed and is unable to defend itself. The loss of the remaining freedom of Czechoslovakia is only a matter of time. As Americans say, Bohemia has changed from a bastion of democracy to an outpost for Germany's renewed aggression. The question is, who is next? Perhaps it is the Netherlands, or Belgium, or Switzerland, or Romania, or perhaps Italy will demand its price in Tunis, Corsica, or Nice in the Mediterranean, or in Djibouti in the Red Sea, or in Spain. Unless all peace-loving countries are determined to work through the League of Nations to restore a strong international order, there is no way to prevent Europe from falling into international anarchy or the control of the Rome-Berlin Axis. This is an excellent opportunity for the national branches of the International Anti-Aggression Movement to urge their respective countries to take action. If France, the Soviet Union, and the British Empire declare their position based on this intention, then there will be no shortage of supporters and assistants, but they must act, and act quickly."

Sir Cecil's Words Unfortunately Prove True

In September of last year, on the eve of the Munich Agreement, Sir Cecil, President of the International Anti-Aggression League, wrote to the British Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post, arguing that British surrender to Germany could not guarantee Czechoslovakia would not suffer renewed aggression, and stated that the German government's guarantees were only a statement of intent at the time and would not be effective in the future. Half a year later, today, his words have unfortunately proven true. The Chinese branch of the Anti-Aggression League has selected and translated the original text as follows: "To the Editor: According to your newspaper's foreign affairs correspondent, the government has surrendered to Hitler. Your newspaper's foreign affairs correspondent has always been known for being well-informed.

According to the report, Mr. Hitler did not convince our government that his demands were just. He merely told Mr. Chamberlain that that was what he meant, and so our cabinet decided to surrender. Poland and Hungary will inevitably follow suit. What shall we do then? Some say that as a remedy, the integrity of the remaining territory of Czechoslovakia, which has been dismembered, should be protected. At present, France and the British Empire have guaranteed to him that 'in the event of foreign aggression, they will respect and maintain its political independence and territorial integrity.' But the question is, if the existing guarantee has been broken, how much strength can a new guarantee add?

It is not impossible for Germany to add its guarantee, but I cannot help but be skeptical, because according to several authorities, Czechoslovakia has been forced to abandon its alliance with France and the Soviet Union. In fact, even if Germany provides a guarantee, how much value would it have? There is no need to blame Germany for breaking its promises, because not only the National Socialist government, but all German governments since Frederick the Great have had a very clear attitude: for them, international guarantees are only a statement of intent at the time, and are not effective in the future.

Bethmann-Hollweg's famous theory of 'a scrap of paper' is not surprising. It is simply a brief explanation of the German point of view on this issue. Bülow's memorandum is worth our attention, because although he criticized Bethmann-Hollweg's statement at the time as foolish, he did not object to the content of the statement. The current German government has repeatedly expressed that they inherit the German traditional view of such matters.

Therefore, surrender to Hitler is equivalent to the elimination of Czech independence, and also equivalent to our betrayal of our treaty vows to Czechoslovakia. At the same time, it is also an acknowledgment of the rising prestige of the National Socialist government and the declining prestige of the British government. In short, it is an acknowledgment that violence is the only way to resolve international events, and an abandonment of the hope of replacing violence with reason and justice. —Cecil, September 20, 1938."

Presidents Song and Shao Express Opinions on U.S. Neutrality Law

Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi, presidents of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League, recently believed that the new Neutrality Act proposed by Senator Pittman, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had many inappropriate aspects. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed Henry Stimson, president of the Non-Participation in Aggression Committee in the United States, and Dr. Elisha, president of the Joint Committee for Peace, and Atkinson, president of the American branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement, to express their views. The translated text of the original telegram is as follows: "On behalf of Chinese public opinion, we hereby offer several suggestions, which we hope will be considered and adopted: (1) 'Neutrality' is only sufficient for smaller countries to use as a diplomatic convenience under special circumstances, and is not sufficient to become the national policy of a great power. (2) Morally speaking, there is no room for neutrality between justice and evil. (3) In terms of current U.S. politics, the evolution of the situation in the Pacific should also be considered in congressional legislation. (4) The 'cash and carry' method is sufficient to benefit belligerent countries with navies and transport ships. In the current Far East conflict, this belligerent country is the aggressor, Japan. On the contrary, this method is harmful to China, the victim of aggression, whose transportation is not perfect, and China is the one that the United States sympathizes with and is willing to help. Therefore, we ask you to use your authority to influence Congress, to educate the public, and to correct isolationism, so as to achieve the ideal that we desire. Both China and the United States will benefit from it. Respectfully, Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi, presidents of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement."

### Ningbo Waters Japanese Warships Roaming Intercepting and Searching Fishing Boats, Planning to Detain Italian Ships

Ningbo Dispatch: At 9:40 AM on the 20th, in the waters off Hengshan Port, Yindong, a Japanese warship sailed from Tingshuimen, Zhenhai. The ship was No. 1 of the Fifth Fleet. It did not stop and immediately sailed into Xiangshan Port to the Hutou Ferry River surface under the jurisdiction of Fenghua County, lowered a speedboat, and searched passing civilian ships. Two fishing boats were seized until about 11:00 AM, when the warship retreated from Hutou Ferry and fired three shots between Hengshan Port and Hutou Ferry, with the shells landing on the beach. The warship then sailed northeastward outside Dongqimen.

The Italian merchant ship "Ende," with permission to load wheat to Ningbo, was sailing through Longshan waters under the jurisdiction of Zhenhai County at 1:30 PM on the 19th when it suddenly encountered a Japanese warship, which ordered the ship to sail with it using flags, intending to detain it. The Italian ship refused and replied with flags, saying that if they wanted to inspect, they could send someone over. The warship then lowered a speedboat, which approached the ship. A Japanese officer, looking at its insignia, seemed to be the ship's second mate, accompanied by a Taiwanese translator, boarded the ship for inspection. The ship's Italian first mate, Baiseli, received them. The Japanese officer accused the ship of being Chinese and intended to seize it. First Mate Baiseli explained that the ship had previously belonged to a Chinese merchant but had now been transferred to an Italian merchant, with a valid license from the Italian government. The Japanese officer could do nothing but inquire about the military situation of the Chinese side. First Mate Bai replied that he did not know. After two hours of entanglement, they left the ship.

### Su and Xi Counties Banning Rice Transport to Shanghai Puppet Provincial Government Asks Japanese Military Department to Implement

Suzhou Dispatch: The puppet organizations of Wu County, Wuxi, Wujin, and Wujiang counties, due to the recent soaring rice prices and dwindling stocks, investigated and found that the rice was being transported to Shanghai for transshipment and export. The upstream provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, which are rice-producing areas, are also prohibited by the Japanese, making transportation impossible. In various county villages, guerrillas do not allow villagers to transport rice into the city for sale. The current rice price exceeds 13 yuan, but it is still difficult to stop the trend. The puppet provincial government has submitted a memorandum to the puppet "Renovation Government," requesting the Central China Japanese Military Department to immediately prohibit grain from being transported out of the territory. In the future, anyone must have a passport to purchase. The transport within the territory of Jiangsu Province should be given a transport permit by the place of origin, and the destination should be noted in the permit, and no detour is allowed, and no loading and exporting is allowed to prevent transshipment to Shanghai and leakage of exports. On the one hand, the Central China Japanese Military Department approved the opening of the rice ban in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, or stipulated the quantity to be shipped out, allowing merchants in Jiangsu Province to purchase and transport to those places, but not to Shanghai. The above measures are being negotiated by the puppet "Ministry of Internal Affairs" and the Central China Japanese Military Department. If implemented, Shanghai rice merchants going to Su and Xi counties to purchase will have problems.

### Zhejiang Provincial Wartime University Over 1,000 Students Register Xu Shaodi Hopes Zhejiang University Will Establish a Branch in Zhejiang

(Yongkang Dispatch) Preparations for the establishment of Zhejiang Provincial Wartime University are underway. The sites for the College of Science and Engineering and the College of Agriculture have been surveyed. According to the registration results, over 1,000 students have volunteered to apply recently. The number of forms not yet received is not included. It is reported that among the 1,000 registrants, there are over 760 high school graduates planning to apply for the first year, and over 260 who have not taken the graduation exam and plan to apply after graduating this summer vacation. As for transfer students in the second and third grades, the number is not very large, and it may not be economical to open classes. The number of classes to be opened in each department will be decided after a meeting and then announced in the newspaper. According to Xu, Commissioner of Education and Director of the Preparatory Committee, the number of people that the wartime university can accommodate is limited. He hopes that National Zhejiang University can also set up a branch school in the province to recruit first-year freshmen, which will alleviate some of the difficulties in the education of young people in the province. He said that he felt the journey to Chongqing was difficult and arduous. Although national universities have joint recruitment, it is very difficult to go to Guizhou and Yunnan from Zhejiang. Therefore, young people in the province who are ambitious and capable of going to school will inevitably sacrifice opportunities due to transportation and economic difficulties. For the sake of cultivating talents for the country and meeting the needs, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has established the Wartime University. The cause of national construction is complex and has many aspects, and cultivating talents should be the top priority. Zhejiang Province has made many achievements during the Anti-Japanese War. This provincial university will not only be the highest institution of learning in eastern Zhejiang in the future, but also a memorial of deep and long-lasting significance in Zhejiang during the Anti-Japanese War.

Wenzhou Temporarily Prohibits Navigation; Gaps in Blockade Line Not Closed; Oujiang Gun Battle Yesterday Sinks Japanese Boat; Strict Precautions in Eastern Zhejiang, Postal Service Suspended; Baobei Ship Damaged by Bombing While Docked in Wenzhou

After the Oujiang River in Wenzhou was closed to ships, navigation to all ports along the Zhejiang coast was cut off. The De Ping, Hai Fu, and Ha Na returned to Shanghai yesterday. The Mou Fu arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the Bao Li is expected to arrive this morning. The Portuguese ship Baobei was bombed in Wenzhou. Japanese warships shelled the Oujiang River again yesterday. Japanese planes flew over Wenzhou and dropped bombs yesterday. Postal services in eastern Zhejiang have been suspended. The details are as follows:

Temporary Navigation Ban, Gap Not Plugged

The Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Headquarters has prohibited any ships from entering or leaving the Oujiang River in Wenzhou and ordered foreign ships docked in Wenzhou to leave before 5:00 PM on the 23rd. As of yesterday, no ships have been able to enter or leave the Oujiang River in Wenzhou. The rock barrier at the mouth of the Oujiang River has already been blockaded, but the gap in the blockade line has not yet been plugged. Underwater mines have been laid inside the Oujiang River, and defensive works have been built at Panshi, Huanghua, and other places, with heavy troops stationed to prevent the Japanese army from landing by stealth. The navigation ban is temporary in nature.

Mou Fu Arrives in Shanghai, Interview with Purser

The German Lihe Shipping Company's ship Mou Fu arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday from Wenzhou and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Purser Ji on board yesterday. According to the purser, the Mou Fu was notified by the Wenzhou authorities to leave Wenzhou and departed Wenzhou at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, carrying more than 300 passengers and cargo. When sailing out of the Huanghua area at the mouth of the Oujiang River, a Japanese vessel continuously shelled the shore. En route, three Japanese warships were seen, seemingly heading to Wenzhou. The ship finally arrived in Shanghai on the 24th.

Oujiang Gun Battle Sinks Japanese Boat

According to the ship Chang of Mou Fu ship, told the Modern News reporter, The Japanese warship parked outside the mouth of the Oujiang River suddenly opened fire and bombarded the Huanghua Customs fortress starting on the morning of the 22nd, and launched many speedboats, fully loaded with Japanese Navy personnel, attempting to land there under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese garrison calmly responded and did not return fire. When the Japanese speedboats approached, they launched a sudden and fierce machine gun barrage, immediately sinking four Japanese speedboats. All of the more than 70 Japanese soldiers on board were wiped out without a single survivor. The remaining Japanese speedboats retreated in disarray. Then, the fortress artillery fired back at the Japanese warship, launching a fierce gun battle. The Japanese could not hold out and retreated. The gun battle stopped at around 2:00 PM.

Wenzhou Peaceful, Residents Evacuated

After Wenzhou was bombed by Japanese planes on the 20th of this month, the city residents evacuated to the countryside. Although the area is now peaceful, some shops have been forced to temporarily close due to evacuation. On the 22nd, three Japanese planes flew over Wenzhou and dropped bombs, with seven bombs landing in the city area. A pawnshop in Xiaonanmen was destroyed, killing more than a dozen citizens on the spot. At the time, the Mou Fu was docked at the Weili Han Wharf and became a temporary shelter after the air raid alarm sounded. Many nearby merchants and residents rushed to the ship for temporary shelter.

Baobei Hit by Bomb, Many Killed and Injured

Japanese planes dropped three bombs towards the riverbank, all of which landed in the Yongchuan Wharf area. One of the bombs landed next to the Portuguese Kang Sheng Company's Baobei ship. More than 20 sampans there were sunk, killing and injuring many people. As for the Baobei ship, it was hit by shrapnel, killing two people on board and injuring more than a dozen. However, the Yongchuan Wharf was not destroyed. The Mou Fu crew members were very panicked when they saw the Japanese planes dropping bombs because they were very close. The bomb that fell into the water had great force, and the Mou Fu suffered a huge shock.

De Ping, Hai Fu, Ha Na Return to Shanghai

The Italian Zhongyi Company's ship De Ping, the German Lihe Shipping Company's ship Hai Fu, and the German Far East Company's ship Ha Na all set sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning. En route, they received a telegram informing them that Wenzhou had banned navigation, so they temporarily turned back to Shanghai. The De Ping temporarily docked at Wusong and only entered the port yesterday afternoon, docking outside the French Concession. The Hai Fu and Ha Na returned to Shanghai yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. All passengers have disembarked, but the cargo on each ship has not been unloaded. The company plans to resume sailing to Wenzhou as soon as the situation in Wenzhou eases to avoid losses during unloading.

Bao Li Turns Back, Arrives in Shanghai This Morning

The Italian Yihua Shipping Company's ship Bao Li sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou. In the waters of Huang Zhong Island outside the mouth of Wenzhou, it was stopped by a Japanese warship. After sailing into the Oujiang River, it had to turn back to Shanghai the night before last at 8:00 PM due to the navigation ban in Wenzhou. The shipping company received a telegram from the shipowner yesterday stating that the ship would arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 AM this morning. All passengers and crew members are safe. Although the food supplies on board are limited, they will not run out. As for the German Lulin Shipping Company's ship Fei Kang, which is currently docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, it did not sail to Wenzhou the day before yesterday, and the rumor that it turned back is inaccurate.

Shanghai-Zhejiang Transportation Completely Cut Off

The navigable ports in eastern Zhejiang are Haimen, Ningbo, and Wenzhou. Now the Jiaojiang River in Haimen has been completely blockaded, the Yongjiang River in Ningbo has prohibited ships from entering or leaving, and Wenzhou has also banned navigation. Thus, transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang, as well as between Hong Kong and Zhejiang, has been completely cut off. The British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships sailing to eastern Zhejiang have all changed their routes. The Italian merchant ships, De Ping, Hai Fu, Fei Kang, Ha Na, and Mou Fu, have decided to temporarily dock in Shanghai. In addition, all Portuguese ships except those that have been detained, Shan Tai, Tang Sai, and Mei Fa, are also docked in Shanghai.

Five Portuguese and Greek Ships Detained in Wenzhou

After Wenzhou banned navigation, all foreign ships were ordered to leave Wenzhou, but the Portuguese Ming He, Xin De, Da Mao, and Baobei, as well as the Greek San Ma, are currently docked within the Wenzhou Oujiang River blockade line and are temporarily unable to sail out of the mouth of the Oujiang River. In addition, the German Lulin Shipping Company's ship Gao Deng and the German Far East Company's ship Tian Bao are currently docked in Dinghai, but the Tian Bao is temporarily sailing between Dinghai and Shenjiamen.

Coastal Areas Under Martial Law, Ende Stuck in Ningbo

In addition to the coastal ports in eastern Zhejiang banning navigation, solid defensive works have been built, and a large army has been stationed with strict precautions. The troops stationed in various places are ready to fight and will resolutely strike if the Japanese army attempts to land by stealth. As for the Italian Zhongyi Company's ship Ende, it was specially permitted to load wheat in Shanghai and arrive in Ningbo. After the cargo was unloaded, it was originally planned to sail to Shanghai immediately, but the authorities prohibited it from loading cargo, so it has been stuck in Ningbo until now. The company has now submitted a request to the Zhejiang military authorities to allow the ship to load cargo and return to Shanghai, which is still under consideration.

Postal Services in Eastern Zhejiang Have Been Suspended

The Shanghai Postal Administration has suspended the acceptance of mail to eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Yuyao, Jinhua, Lishui, Yongkang, Wenzhou, and other places, as well as all places along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, including ordinary, express, registered, large and small packages, and remittances, starting from 2:00 PM yesterday. A notice was issued stating: (1) The acceptance of large packages to all counties and cities in eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is suspended from today. This is hereby announced. (2) Individual packages containing packages and medicines will be temporarily suspended from the 24th of this month to eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. (3) The dispatch of small package mail to all counties and cities in eastern Zhejiang will be temporarily suspended from today. (4) For remittances, etc., the bureau chief Zha Peilin notified the remittance group, express mail group, registered group, and mailing group to suspend the processing of all mail to eastern Zhejiang.

Chinese Army Intercepts Truck, Confiscates Japanese Yarn and Opium; Gonghe Transportation Company Truck Suddenly Intercepted at Baimaotang; Huge Amount of Japanese Yarn and Opium Destroyed

A truck belonging to the Gonghe Transportation Company was suddenly intercepted by the Chinese army at around 1:00 PM on the 23rd of this month near the 58th bridge on the Shanghai-Xihu Highway (near Baimaotang). There were more than ten pieces of Japanese yarn on the truck, worth four or five thousand yuan, which were burned on the spot. Opium worth more than 30,000 yuan was also found. The opium was being trafficked by Zhu Shunqing, the pseudo "detective team leader" of Changshu, and has been destroyed by the Chinese army.

Undermining Resistance, Extravagantly Advocating Peace; Wang Jingwei's Conspiracy Fully Exposed; Attempts to Slander the Government and Buy Off News Agencies in Hong Kong and Shanghai

Since Japan began advocating the so-called establishment of a new order in East Asia, knowledgeable people have ignored it. The expected goal cannot be realized. Recently, Japan has again attempted to take advantage of the current international situation to instigate Wang Jingwei to launch a new situation and slander the Chinese government's internal figures sympathetic to Wang's absurd actions in order to create a false impression. Recently, people were sent to Hong Kong and Shanghai to buy newspapers and a small number of reporters, and to use the existing equipment of the China Daily to plan to establish the Minli Daily in Shanghai, which will be published soon. At the same time, the Republic of China News Agency is being prepared as its propaganda organ. The purpose is to intensify the propaganda that China is unable to resist Japan and to help Wang achieve his conspiracy to destroy China. However, this conspiracy has been discerned by all parties and will not succeed. Chen Xingmin, a lawyer in this city, has worked hard for social undertakings on weekdays and has won praise from all walks of life. Unfortunately, he was lured out and shot on the 7th of last month, resulting in serious injuries that have not yet healed. Recently, Mr. Chen read various newspapers and found that the Associated Press's telegram from Chongqing on the 21st reported that Wang Jingwei had bought the Huadong Printing Factory on Avener Road, reorganized the Xinhua Printing Factory, and undertook to print various publications advocating "peace." Chen was originally the perennial legal advisor of the factory and was sincerely afraid of misunderstandings. In order to protect himself, he has written to the factory, refusing to continue serving as the perennial legal advisor.

British Consulate General's Attitude Towards Chinese Newspapers; Requests Newspapers to Record Cautiously; No Order Issued to Ban Articles

The English "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the Shanghai British Consulate authorities summoned the publishers of British-owned Chinese newspapers to the British Consulate General last Saturday and Sunday for a meeting to prevent these newspapers from publishing anti-Japanese and pro-National Government sentiments. It is heard that the consulate authorities did not issue an order banning articles, but made various requests. It is believed that this was done because the Japanese consulate authorities requested to suppress such news, hence this action. The main point of the Japanese opposition seems to be that these newspapers publish new Kuomintang notices on the spiritual mobilization movement. As for news obtained directly, the use of words such as "puppet" and "traitor" is not a problem if used in quotations, such as in telegrams of speeches by so-and-so. Examples of various terms used in British-owned Chinese newspapers were shown to the publishers. It is believed that after the publishers understood the points raised by the consulate staff, they may agree to no longer use the opposed words in the future, but they will argue that the freedom of the British press and the attempt to prohibit it are unconstitutional. It is also heard that the publishers asked the consulate staff whether they had taken any action to curb the anti-British sentiments expressed by Japanese-owned Chinese newspapers in this city.

### 怡和紗廠工人　突遭日方逮捕　聽信工頭誣吿捕去七人　廠方交涉後五人已獲釋　工人行動已被監視

EWO Textile Factory Workers Suddenly Arrested by Japanese; Seven Arrested on False Accusations by Foremen; Five Released After Factory Negotiations; Workers' Actions Being Monitored

The British EWO Textile Factory on Yangshupu Road has a long history. The factory originally had foremen and supervisors who were responsible for recommending workers and handling factory affairs, and the foremen and supervisors exploited the workers' interests and reaped huge profits every month. After the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle broke out, the factory, located in the war zone, was temporarily closed. After the National Army withdrew and Shanghai fell, the factory resumed work and abolished the names of foremen and supervisors, dismissing them. Unexpectedly, these foremen still gathered in the Yangshupu area, constantly seeking out male and female workers working in the factory, trying to disrupt the work. Because all the workers were not used by them, they could not achieve their goals, so they resented the workers and reported to the Japanese that there were workers in the factory participating in anti-Japanese work. When work was over, Japanese military police guarded the factory gate and escorted seven workers, who were identified by the foremen, to the Hongkou detention center.

### 市民組募款已近　三十萬元　各勸募隊預定本月募足十萬

Citizens' Group Fundraising Nears 300,000 Yuan; Each Fundraising Team Scheduled to Raise 100,000 Yuan This Month

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee is very active in carrying out fundraising work. As of recently, the amount of donations raised, collected and uncollected, is close to 300,000 yuan. The number of refugees sought for adoption has reached more than 13,000. As for the achievements of the association's fundraising teams, the last fourth payment has exceeded 90,000 yuan. It is now planned to raise 100,000 yuan before the end of this month. The association has sent letters to the leaders of each fundraising team yesterday, asking them to step up their work.

Two Workers Still in Danger

Since this incident occurred, all the workers have been uneasy and resentful of the Japanese's unwarranted arrest of workers, and demanded that the factory rescue them immediately. There was once a strike, but after the factory negotiated with the Japanese, five workers were released the day before yesterday. The Japanese believe that the remaining two workers are related to the terrorist case, so they are still detained. The factory is still negotiating, and at the same time, in order to protect the lives and safety of all workers, it has requested the concession authorities to assist in arresting the troublemaking foremen. At the same time, the Japanese have also sent three Japanese military police, ostensibly to protect the workers, but in reality to monitor the workers' actions.

Mutual Aid Association Asks Factory to Protect

All the male and female workers of the factory, in order to protect their lives and ensure the safety of the factory's work, have organized the EWO Textile Factory Workers' Mutual Aid Association. The original letter stated: "Greetings. It has been decades since your factory was established. In the past, workers were recommended to work in the factory by foremen. However, the titles of foremen and supervisors were all abolished the year before last. Fortunately, your factory sympathized with the workers' suffering. At that time, in addition to dismissing bad workers, the original workers were retained in the factory to avoid the impact of unemployment. As a result, these foremen and supervisors have repeatedly devised vicious schemes to prevent the workers from living and working in peace. Under this situation, the workers have flocked to the factory for a living. Unexpectedly, these unscrupulous elements have acted in a secretive and unscrupulous manner, falsely accusing the workers of illegal activities, resulting in the arrest of seven workers in your factory. The families of these workers have suffered unwarranted injustice and have appealed to your factory for proof. Now, we see your factory's notice stating that it has requested the Japanese military police to protect the workers' safety when they enter and leave the factory. Your factory's virtue of caring for the workers is truly admirable. However, when the workers go home after work, these unscrupulous elements will continue to cause accidents. The workers believe in the saying, 'You must not have the intention to harm others, but you must have the intention to guard against others.' Especially in this era, the workers should plan for the long-term benefit of your factory to avoid disasters for both sides. We have convened a meeting and resolved to specially invite Xu Yanlun, Liu Rongji, Cai Xin, Xu Guanche, Liu Renji, Tang Weisheng, He Ying, etc. as worker representatives to legally organize the EWO Textile Factory Workers' Mutual Aid Office. Internally, it is to ensure that the workers used by your factory will not have strikes or accidents in the future. Externally, it is to legally ensure that the workers will not be subjected to any injustice or accidental losses. For this reason, we have attached the draft charter and respectfully request your factory to review and approve it. We respectfully ask the general manager of your factory to quickly revise the charter and instruct us to comply with it. This is a win-win situation. To the General Manager of the EWO Textile Factory, respectfully."

### Shanghai Museum Exhibition - Rare Animals

The Shanghai Museum, located at No. 20 Museum Road, was established in the thirteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1874) and has been in existence for over sixty years. Its collection is the richest in China, especially in the biological field, such as birds, beasts, fish, butterflies, reptiles, amphibians, and mollusks. They account for about seven or eight tenths of the exhibits. Rare and exotic birds and animals are displayed in a dazzling array. The arrangement method follows that of major British and American museums, using large glass cabinets and displaying them in a natural environment, making the viewer feel as if they are in the midst of a remote mountain forest. It is heard that the museum has recently acquired several kinds of rare animals, such as pandas, wild cattle, and sika deer. Mr. Tang, a technician at the museum, has carefully arranged them and will soon put them on display for public viewing. It is said that pandas are produced in the deep forests of the high mountains of western China. Bamboo shoots and bamboo leaves are their main food. Pandas are mostly timid, like to live alone, and are good at climbing trees. They are extremely difficult to catch. This spring, an American Mr. S. Secretes spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to capture several of them and send them to the United States by plane. They are very precious. It is said that this white panda was also a gift from Mr. Secretes.

### Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties - Closing Today

The sensationally popular Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties has, since establishing preferential admission policies for students, seen visits over the past two days from students of all levels from more than twenty schools, including Jiaotong University, Taicang and Zhenjiang Normal Schools, Yuqing, Guoguang, Zhengguang Middle Schools, Zhengxing, Peiming, Huaijiu, several Girls' Middle Schools, Suzhou Art College, Dongya Sports College, and Wuxi Chinese College. Most were led by teachers, who spoke and pointed at the famous works to arouse students' understanding of the legacy of their ancestors and their patriotic and love-for-hometown emotions. Therefore, the venue was almost like a lecture hall, and the atmosphere was very lively. The exhibition, which started on the 21st, has a duration of five days, and today is the last day. At 6 pm, this unprecedented grand event will be declared closed.

### National Flag Confiscated - French Consul-General Agreed to Return Today - Result of Taxpayers' Association's Repeated Negotiations Yesterday

Regarding the case of the French Concession interfering with the hanging of flags, after the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession negotiated a solution with the Chief Superintendent of the French Concession Police, although the arrested citizens have been released, the confiscated national flags have not yet been returned, which is of great concern to all circles. Merchants whose national flags were confiscated have repeatedly inquired with the Taxpayers' Association, requesting their prompt return. For this reason, the association conducted further negotiations yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Mr. Guo Shuliang, Secretary of the Association, first requested the return from the Lujiazui General Police Station, but the police station replied that it had not yet received orders from the French Consul-General. Mr. Qu Zhenhua, a member of the Association, then personally negotiated with the French Consulate-General at 10:30 AM. He was received by the French Vice-Consul Brot. Mr. Qu first stated that a solution had been negotiated with the Chief Superintendent of Police, that in addition to releasing the arrested persons, the confiscated national flags would be returned upon the Taxpayers' Association submitting a letter, and requested the French Consul-General to immediately instruct the police station so that the Taxpayers' Association could retrieve them and distribute them to the various shops. Brot replied that the French authorities had decided to return the national flags according to the previously negotiated solution and that there would be no changes. However, he feared that the procedures would not be completed today and that they could be handed over to the Association for distribution to the merchants by tomorrow morning.

### Import Surplus of Japanese Trade in the First Quarter of This Year - Increased by More Than 50 Million Yuan Compared to Last Year - Imports Mainly Raw Materials for Munitions - Exports Decreased by More Than 13 Million Yuan

The Continental Daily News reports that in the first quarter of this year, Japan's trade with countries outside the Yen Bloc saw a significant import surplus, totaling 199,737,000 Yen. During this period, Japan imported goods from countries outside the Yen Bloc, mostly raw materials for heavy industry, especially raw materials for manufacturing munitions under the current emergency situation. This point is generally considered quite important. Compared with the same period last year, exports decreased by 13,477,000 Yen, while imports increased by 57,309,000 Yen. This deserves attention because Japan's export of its products to foreign countries has become increasingly difficult during wartime. Light industry and small industry have always been the characteristics of Japan's manufacturing structure, and their exports account for a large part. However, due to the emergency of the war against China and the constant need to guard against any unexpected international events, light industry and small industry seem to be rapidly giving way, replaced by heavy industry, especially the munitions industry. Japan's exports are increasingly being channeled to the Northeast Provinces and North China within the so-called Yen area. However, it should be noted that Japan's exports to the Yen Bloc do not directly result in foreign currency earnings. Although Japan has obtained the raw material resources of the Northeast Provinces and North China, in the final analysis, Japan obtains most of these raw materials by exchanging them for Japanese goods imported into the same region.

### Workers from Local Newspapers Comfort the Lone Army

Out of concern for the recent situation of the Lone Army on Jiaozhou Road, more than forty workers from local newspaper printing plants carried daily necessities (such as towels, soap, and toothpaste) to express their condolences yesterday afternoon, and presented a banner that reads "Adding Glory to the Country." These condolence gifts were all voluntarily donated by the workers of the various newspapers, with excellent results. During the visit to the camp, they were received by Company Commander Lei, who led them on a tour of the various departments and the ball court. Although Regiment Commander Xie was unable to receive them due to illness, he gave all the workers signed mementos. All the officers also wrote inscriptions to encourage them. All the workers were satisfied. Finally, they performed the play "Farewell."

### Grain Reserves Increasing Daily - Food Supply Not in Danger of Panic - Warm Weather Encourages Hoarders to Sell - Storing One Million Bags of Grain Can Be Realized

The source of rice and grain in this city has been particularly congested in recent days. In addition, the weather is warm, and the grain accumulated by hoarders is gradually being sold off, so the market supply exceeds demand, and market prices are declining daily. According to reports from the Evaluation Association, the current grain reserves in Shanghai are increasing daily. In addition to the limited amount accumulated by civilians along the Yangtze River, the production areas not along the river still have abundant reserves. Now that the weather is turning warm, they are all rushing to transport and sell in Shanghai. According to the plan to store one million bags in the Shanghai market, it should not be difficult to achieve. In the future, even during the period between harvests, the food supply will not be affected in any way.

### Fengxian Situation Pacified - A Small Number of Unstable Troops Thoroughly Cleared - Garrison Guerrilla Team Issues Public Notice to Reassure the People

The situation in Fengxian has been completely pacified. After the guerrilla team cleared a very small number of unstable troops, an unprecedented unity has been formed. The county seat of Fengxian is now guarded by another strong guerrilla team, which has issued a public notice to reassure the people. Order has been fully restored to its original state. After Li Zhiming resigned to take responsibility, past disputes will be handled by the Commissioner's Office. Furthermore, according to people from Nanhui, the news of Xu Xinzhou's murder has not been confirmed.

No Trace of the Japanese South of Duxing

The Nanhui puppet "army" has been under severe pressure from the guerrilla team in recent days and has completely withdrawn from the towns of Luhui and Zhaigang along the Lao Zhaigang River. Currently, only Dujiaxing still has a small number of troops entrenched. There is no trace of the Japanese puppets south of Dujiaxing. A portion of the civilian houses in Luhui Town was burned down by the puppet "army." Although the villagers have gradually returned, the scene after the disaster is extremely desolate. Currently, the guerrilla team is tracking and advancing north, and Dujiaxing will not be difficult to recover in one fell swoop. The situation in the areas of Xinchang and Hangtou south of Zhoupu is also very tense as the Nancheng guerrilla team prepares to advance west.

Family Members of Traitors in Xinchang Executed

According to people from Xinchang, Nanhui, Pudong, after the town was occupied by the Japanese puppet army, Tao Ruisheng was appointed as the puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association." A few days ago, Tao's niece went to the Zhongxinqiao area, twelve miles east of Xinchang, and was captured by the guerrilla team. The case was reported to the detachment leader for approval and executed by shooting, with her head displayed as a warning to those who act as lackeys for the enemy.

### Reorganization Plan for China Business Corporation - Letters Sent to All Creditors - Awaiting Judgment from the American Court

The China Business Corporation, formerly in September 1935, petitioned the American Court of this city to appoint a custodian in accordance with bankruptcy laws. The court appointed Hu Xifu as custodian. On April 17 this year, Hu submitted a plan to the court to reorganize the company. All shareholders of the company and holders of the company's bonds were sent a copy of the plan on the same day. According to Hu, the reorganization plan submitted to the court last week described the past and present situation of the company, and listed the proposed reorganization terms one by one. When the company petitioned for the appointment of a custodian in September 1935, all mortgages and 8% bonds were unable to repay principal and interest. The reason was that the company's debtors mortgaged land to the company and failed to repay principal and interest. In September 1935, the Shanghai real estate industry was in extreme decline. Selling real estate would inevitably result in losses. At that time, selling the mortgaged land to debtors and creditors would result in significant losses. Since being appointed as custodian, in accordance with the court's instructions, he negotiated with the company's debtors to sell off their mortgaged land whenever there was an opportunity. At the same time, he negotiated with creditors to transfer securities at favorable prices to creditors. At that time, due to the sluggish market and the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the resolution between the company and its creditors and debtors took time. However, most of the company's debts and secured bonds have been paid off to creditors without loss, and the company has benefited greatly. Therefore, the company is now able to propose a plan to reorganize the company. The company currently owes mortgages, including 700,000 yuan for the first mortgage bonds at 7%, and also includes current account debts, totaling 4 million yuan. Hu, with the court's permission, negotiated with creditors to extend the repayment period for these debts to December 31, 1939, or after that date. The company's remaining debts, including principal and interest, are approximately 12 million yuan, of which 11.7 million yuan are for 8% bonds, and 300,000 yuan are owed to Madame Galing, all of whom are unsecured creditors. According to recent estimates, the company's assets are worth approximately 13 million yuan, 3.5 million yuan lower than recorded in the books. The company's total debts are approximately 16 million yuan, of which 4 million yuan are owed to secured creditors, and the remaining 12 million yuan are owed to holders of 8% bonds and Madame Galing. According to the proposed reorganization plan, all mortgage creditors can have their debts repaid by the company when they are due. Creditors of 7% bonds should receive all interest and one-fifth of the principal, and the remaining principal will be repaid in four installments, all within twelve months after the plan is approved by the court. As for the creditors of 8% bonds, Madame Galing, and shareholders of the company's common stock, their bonds will be canceled after the plan is approved by the court, and will be handled according to the following method: Creditors of 8% bonds and Madame Galing will be given newly issued common stock of the company equal to the face value and interest. Shareholders of the company's existing common stock will be given new common stock with a face value of 10 yuan for every 20 old shares, valued at 10 yuan per share. According to this calculation, approximately 12,250,000 yuan of new common stock will be issued, of which 98% will be given to creditors of 8% bonds and Madame Galing, and the remaining 2% will be given to the company's existing shareholders. After the reorganization, the company's position will be quite good. The company's debts to creditors of 7% bonds, such as mortgages, are approximately 3.5 million yuan, all of which are fully secured. In addition, the company also has unmortgaged real estate and other assets worth approximately 8 million yuan, which can be operated for profit. The company has now sent the plan to creditors with bonds and Madame Galing, and in accordance with the court's instructions, sent an acknowledgment form to be signed and returned to the American Court for judgment. The date of this plan is 10:00 AM on June 5.

### After Being Released by the Japanese, the New Haimen Arrives Safely in Shantou - Previously Forced to Sail to Taiwan - Said to Be a Misunderstanding

The New Haimen, a British merchant ship of the Williamson Company, operating on the Hong Kong-Shantou-Fuzhou route, with a gross tonnage of 2,455 tons and a net tonnage of 1,571 tons, was detained by a Japanese warship while sailing from Fuzhou to Shantou, off the coast of Erge. Troops were sent to inspect it and forced it to sail to Taiwan. The shipowner urgently telegraphed British warships anchored in Fujian for assistance, and the Japanese side then agreed to release it. It arrived safely in Shantou on the 22nd of this month. It is heard that the Japanese detained the New Haimen by mistake, believing it to be a Chinese merchant ship, as there was a Chinese ship with the same name, New Haimen, in the past.

### Japanese Soldiers Beat Carpenter with Sticks - Seriously Injured and Unconscious - Life in Danger

Cai Wenxing, a 27-year-old man from Ningbo, living at No. 30 Longqing Lane, Tilanqiao, Hongkou, was working as a carpenter. Yesterday afternoon, around 5:00 PM, he was repairing doors and windows in a Japanese military camp in Hongkou. Because he was working a little slowly and failed to satisfy the Japanese soldiers, the Japanese soldiers suddenly struck Cai's buttocks three times with wooden sticks. Cai was shocked and seriously injured, falling to the ground unconscious. He was later transported to Renji Hospital for treatment by another carpenter. Due to excessive shock, he was still unconscious after arriving at the hospital. According to the doctor's examination, he was seriously injured and his life may be in danger.

### Japan Does Not Reply to Portuguese Consulate's Protest - Detained Portuguese Ships Began Unloading Cargo Yesterday - Various Companies Discussing the Issue of Returning Goods

Ten Portuguese ships, including Tangbei, Tangqiao, Tanglu, Meda, Hailong, Libao, Lude, Baode, Fulu, and Dade, were detained by Japanese warships one after another and are now anchored at various pontoons in Yangshupu, guarded by Japanese soldiers. Although the Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai protested and demanded their prompt release, the Japanese Consul-General Miura did not reply. However, the cargo on the ships has been allowed to be unloaded first. Except for the Tang-class ships, which had already unloaded fresh goods first, the official unloading began in batches yesterday. Yesterday, Meda and Hailong were unloaded.

The Meriwether, Meder, Atlantic and other companies held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss the issue of returning goods from the ships.

### Father and Son Go to Court - Father Accuses Son of Malicious Abandonment - Son Denies the Status of Father's Second Wife - Both Sides Maintain Their Positions and the Hearing Is Rescheduled

Li Ganquan, a 66-year-old man from Nanhui, residing at No. 63 Baier Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, along with his concubine Zhang (a 55-year-old woman from Suzhou), hired lawyer Wang Shouan to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division against his son from his deceased first wife, Li Keding (37 years old), and his daughter-in-law, Xia (28 years old), for malicious abandonment and failure to fulfill the obligation to provide for his basic needs. He requested the court to investigate and prosecute according to law and to order them to provide support through an ancillary civil suit. He claimed that the defendants and their spouses were unfilial and enjoyed their wealth with 洋房 and car exclusively, refusing to provide any financial support for the plaintiff's parents. Keding had won half of the top prize in an aviation lottery in the 24th year, receiving 125,000 yuan, which he shared with friends and relatives but gave nothing to his parents. After repeated negotiations in the 25th year, he finally agreed to pay 15 yuan per month for support. However, since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, he has stopped paying the agreed fee. Instead, he listened to his wife Xia and, along with servants, violently beat the plaintiff and pushed him out the door. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to send a letter for negotiation, but it was ineffective, so he is filing a lawsuit to request investigation and prosecution, and to order them to pay 50 yuan per month for living expenses, calculating 6,000 yuan for ten years, to be paid in one lump sum. Upon receiving the complaint, the court notified the defendants to appear. The defendant couple hired lawyer Yin Yong to defend them and submitted a defense, divided into two points: (1) Li Zhang, the plaintiff in this case, is not the mother of the defendant Li Keding and is unknown to him, so she has no right to file a private prosecution. He requests that the court order a stay of judgment on the part of Li Zhang's private prosecution in accordance with the law. (2) When the defendant Li Keding was four years old, his father, the plaintiff Li Ganquan, abandoned the family and never returned. Fortunately, his uncle Qiuquan maintained the family's life. Keding's mother passed away when he was seven years old, and he was raised and cultivated by his uncle Qiuquan until he graduated and took teaching positions at various schools. Since then, his father has often visited to ask for money, which he gave several times and left. He has no proper occupation to this day. Keding got married at the age of 33 and formed a family. He then invited his father to live with him, but he refused, and instead came to ask for money from time to time, without any restrictions. Because the monthly demands were too high to bear, his uncle Qiuquan mediated in the 25th year and agreed to pay 15 yuan per month for support, with a contract signed and certified by a lawyer. Every month, the money was entrusted to a third party for delivery or sent by post. After the August 13th Incident, Keding has been repairing and selling used cars in Shanghai and continues to fulfill the agreed monthly support payment. In addition to this, his father still often comes, insisting on staying for meals and being given three or five yuan. At the end of last year's lunar calendar, he asked for New Year's expenses and was given 15 yuan. The defendant Xia has always treated her father-in-law kindly and has never offended him. The relationship between father and son and father-in-law and daughter-in-law is harmonious. The allegations are not true. As for the point that the defendants violently beat the plaintiff at the end of last year, he requests that the neighbors be summoned for verification and detailed questioning, and that the defendants be found innocent and the ancillary civil suit be dismissed. The case was heard by Judge Zhang Mingsheng at 3:00 PM yesterday. Both parties and their lawyers were present. The plaintiff first stated the purpose of the lawsuit. The defendant couple absolutely denied the abandonment and beating, stating that the living expenses were paid every month without fail and that someone was involved in the transfer. The court verified the statements and decided to reschedule the hearing to the afternoon of May 3, and then adjourned the court. The clan elder Li Qiuquan and others from both sides also attended the court to listen.

### Robbery on Shandong Road

Chen Jingsheng's residence at No. 7, Lane 352, near the intersection of Guangdong Road and Shandong Road, was suddenly broken into by robbers around 8:30 PM yesterday. At that time, the owner of the house was not at home, and all the other people were held under guard by the bandits, who rummaged through boxes and cabinets, looting for more than thirty minutes before leaving. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the police station, requesting them to pursue the case. The police station dispatched detectives to investigate and inquire about the appearance and accent of the bandits, and reported back to the police station for the purpose of pursuing the arrest. As for the losses, they are currently being tallied and are said to be quite large.

### Xujiahui Observatory (2)

— Tang Minghe

Astronomical Research

The astronomical department of the Xujiahui Observatory is located on Yu Mountain, fifteen miles from Shanghai, and was founded in 1900. The observatory has a large equatorial instrument (telescope), with a lens length of seven meters and a lens diameter of forty 分. There are two such telescopes, arranged in parallel, one for photography and one for visual observation.

The world's largest telescope of the same type as the Sheshan Observatory is located in Yerkes, USA, with a lens diameter of one meter (39.37 inches). The telescope at Mt. Wilson in the United States is currently the world's largest reflecting telescope, with a lens diameter of one hundred inches. A reflecting telescope with a lens diameter of two hundred inches is currently being built in the United States, which will be the world's largest reflecting telescope in the future.

There is a common misconception about telescopes, which is that the larger the lens, the larger the objects can be magnified. In fact, the size of celestial bodies can be magnified entirely by the eyepiece. Therefore, the purpose of having a large lens is to concentrate the light. If the light is not enough, no matter how much you magnify it, you will never be able to see clearly.

The Sheshan telescope can enhance the light of a star of magnitude four to magnitude thirteen. In the past, it has photographed 12,000 sunspots and determined the positions of 14,000 celestial bodies. It has studied 1,200 binary stars and star clusters and has calculated the perturbations of Jupiter's orbit on other planets more than 100 times. This is a general overview of the work of the Sheshan Observatory.

The reporter asked when the next solar eclipse could be seen in Shanghai. Father Mao replied: It will be in 1941. The area where the total eclipse can be seen is between Hankou and Wenzhou. Shanghai can see more than nine-tenths of the solar eclipse.

Work in Other Places

The Xujiahui Observatory has also conducted several inland expeditions, including an expedition to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, where it surveyed and mapped 54 maps and determined the locations of 50 cities. The Governor-General of Annam also invited the observatory to plan and establish meteorological stations. The lighthouses along the Chinese coast are also inspected by the observatory from time to time to check the accuracy of the instruments.

(3) Current Situation

The Xujiahui Observatory is subsidized by the French Church, the French Municipal Council, and various shipping companies. Before the war, the Chinese government also contributed to the subsidy. Everything in the observatory is the responsibility of the priests. Initially, the Pope of Rome designated the Xujiahui Diocese to be managed by the French Church, so most of the priests in the observatory are French, but there is also an Italian priest now.

Past Priests

The first director of the observatory was Father Dechevrens, the second was Chevallier, the third was Father Froc, and the fourth, and current, is Father Lejay. The third priest served the longest, a total of 25 years. He is known as the "Father of Typhoons," which shows his contribution to predicting typhoons.

The current priests are: Director Father Yan (P. Lejay), Father Long (E. Gherzi) is responsible for climate and earthquakes, currently Father Mao (L. Dumas) - whom the reporter visited - is acting on his behalf and responsible for climate and earthquakes, Father Bu (M. Burgand) is responsible for electromagnetism and timekeeping, and travels back and forth between Sheshan and Shanghai, because since the war, the electromagnetic department in Zhaojiabang has been moved to Sheshan, and Father Wei (E. de la Villemarque) is responsible for the Sheshan Observatory.

Wartime Situation

Since the outbreak of the current Sino-Japanese War, the government meteorological reporting stations along the Yangtze River and in the Chinese interior have stopped working. Fortunately, the stations in the Pacific and Fuzhou and Shantou continue to work. Therefore, the typhoon prediction work has not been affected in any way. According to Father Mao, looking at the clouds in the sky, it is possible to predict whether the local area will encounter a typhoon in 24 hours. Because the meteorological reporting stations in the interior and along the Chinese coast have all or mostly stopped reporting, Xujiahui cannot accurately predict the weather between Shanghai and Beijing, Shanghai and Hankou, and Shanghai and Guangzhou. Fortunately, these three air routes have all been suspended, so whether or not to predict is irrelevant.

The war has no direct impact on the work of Xujiahui.

(4) Chinese Astronomical Facts

After the establishment of the Xujiahui Observatory, the Qingdao Observatory was established at the beginning of the 20th century. Its scope was of course relatively narrow.

The Central Meteorological Observatory in Nanjing is the most well-equipped observatory in China, much more complete than Xujiahui. Although the internal instruments have been transported to the interior, they are scattered in various places and have not been installed for use. This is a pity, because the Central Meteorological Observatory not only occupies a leading position in China, but also has a considerable position in the world of astronomy. Although it was established not long ago, it has made a lot of research in astronomy.

Currently, there is no major astronomical work in China.

(5) Contribution of Catholicism to Chinese Astronomy

As mentioned earlier, Western missionaries introduced European astronomy to China in the 17th century. Unfortunately, the Chinese did not train talents to continue the work of the Westerners. Two hundred years later, the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai was established.

As for why Catholicism is interested in astronomy, or in science, is there a special scholarship system? There is none! However, Catholics feel that studying science is pursuing true knowledge, and there is no conflict between religion and science, and there should be no conflict. This is what they deeply believe now, so they have a strong interest in science.

Father Mao also explained that the purpose of the Xujiahui Observatory is to serve the people, without any color, and does not selectively serve anyone. (End)

### Major Robbery at Nantong Dasheng Textile Mill: Thieves Colluding from Within; Factory Firemen and Others Form a Gang to Rob Forcibly; Main Culprits Bian Minghui and Two Others Arrested; Confessions Must Be Verified and Jurisdiction Designated

Cui Chengke, a Chinese detective chief, and detective Xu Dezhong of the Chengdu Road Police Station previously arrested six bandits, Bian Mingyi, Hu Cunyi, Zhu Shengtai, Bian Zhu-shi, Bian Cao-shi, and Bian Minghui, at No. 6 Lixian Lane, Xizilaihuo Street, and No. 38 Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road. Two passbooks for the Bank of Communications, totaling 1,400 yuan, and the China Industrial Bank, totaling 300 yuan, were confiscated. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is now learned that the police have found that Zhu Shengtai, Bian Cao-shi, and Bian Zhu-shi were not involved and have applied to the court for their release. The remaining three, Bian Mingyi and others, colluded with more than twenty other bandits in Tangjia Zha, Nantong, at 1:00 AM on January 30th of this year, and robbed the Dasheng Textile Mill of 87,279 yuan in legal tender, which they divided and spent. Yesterday morning, the police sent Bian Mingyi, Hu Cunyi, and Bian Minghui to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station filed a lawsuit for the crime of robbery with a gang under Article 320 of the Criminal Law. He detailed the case, saying that the defendant Bian Minghui was a member of the security team at the Nantong Dasheng Textile Mill, and his sister, Bian Xiuzhu (wife of Hu Cunyi), was a female worker at the Dasheng Textile Mill, so they were very familiar with the situation in the factory. Since the fall of Nantong, the factory had been shut down. Bian Minghui was then reassigned as a fireman, specializing in night watch duties. Unexpectedly, Bian and the others were well aware that a large sum of money was hidden in the factory warehouse, and they conceived a wicked plan. They colluded with Zhao Hongfei, Bian Xiuzhu's lover, and more than twenty bandits, including Yuan Zhengqing and Wang Jinbiao, and broke into the Dasheng Textile Mill on the night of January 29th, each carrying rifles and Mauser guns. Bian Minghui acted as an inside accomplice, and they looted over 80,000 yuan. They rested in an empty house nearby that night and then went to Shixu the next day to divide the spoils. Bian Mingyi received 1,500 yuan, Hu Cunyi received 500 yuan, Bian Minghui received 32,000 yuan, Bian Xiuzhu received 1,700 yuan, and the remaining money was divided among Yuan Zhengqing and others. The defendants then fled to Taixing and came to Shanghai via a detour, where they were arrested. Subsequently, Zhang Shenzhou, the deputy manager of the Dasheng Textile Mill, testified about the robbery, saying that the secret lock of the factory warehouse was only known to a staff member surnamed Jin, and that the defendants forcibly ordered Jin to open it. Judge Chuan Lin briefly questioned the defendants, stating that the case occurred in Nantong, and the court should apply to the Supreme Court for designation of jurisdiction. The hearing was adjourned for fourteen days for further review, and the defendants were remanded to custody. The stolen money, 1,700 yuan, was returned in advance.

### American Merchant's Apparent Suicide Attributed to Economic Pressure; Wife and Two Children Left Behind in Tragic Circumstances

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Rosenfield, a 31-year-old American fur merchant in Shanghai, had offices at No. 117 Edward Road and No. 131 Museum Road, and was also a member of the American Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. This morning (the 24th) at around 8:00 AM, he was found dead in his Museum Road office, lying stiff in a pool of blood. A Shanghai Volunteer Corps service rifle was found beside the body. A friend of the deceased stated that he believed Rosenfield committed suicide due to the bleak prospects of the Shanghai fur trade after the Japanese cut off the supply sources, leading to economic difficulties. According to the authorities investigating the tragedy, the deceased left several notes mentioning economic hardship, suggesting that the case was clearly a suicide. It is reported that Rosenfield left behind a wife and two children. Upon hearing the news, his friends expressed deep regret.

A special report from this newspaper states that at 8:10 AM yesterday morning, an American youth at the Sun Tat Company on the third floor of the YMCA Building at No. 131 Museum Road in the Public Concession suddenly committed suicide with a rifle, the bullet hitting his head, causing instant death. Details are as follows:

Career

J. Rosenfield was an American citizen, 35 years old, who had been in Shanghai for a long time. He had been running the Wing Woh Company at No. 117 Edward Road in the French Concession, engaging in import and export business. Before the August 13th Incident, the business was very good. Later, he also set up a branch at the Sun Tat Company on the third floor of No. 131 Museum Road, also engaging in import and export. Outside of his business, Rosenfield also joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps as a member, and had been for many years.

Losses

This American used to run the export of fur goods from North China. Recently, due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, transportation was obstructed, and he was also subject to Japanese control, which affected his business. For the past two years, he has suffered huge losses, resulting in a high debt burden. The company's economic turnover was difficult, and the business of the two firms was difficult to maintain, so he conceived the idea of taking his own life.

Suicide

Yesterday morning, at around 8:00 AM, Rosenfield, in the office of the Sun Tat Company on Museum Road, while the staff had not yet arrived, secretly used his usual Volunteer Corps rifle, loaded a bullet, aimed the muzzle at his head, and stepped on the trigger. With a bang, the bullet hit a vital spot, and he fell to the ground, blood gushing out. The servants heard the sound and went out to see him lying on the floor, barely breathing. They urgently reported to the Central Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. He had already died.

Investigation

The body was then transported by car to Room No. 1 of the Universal Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road for preparation for burial. The office where the incident occurred was photographed and sealed off, pending investigation by experts. Rosenfield's residence was at a certain number on Tianfeng Road in West Shanghai. He left behind a wife and two daughters. The wife was young and the daughters were only four years old.

### Woman Falsely Accused of Drug Trafficking; Acquitted on Appeal

Hu Zhang-shi, a woman from Dongtai residing at No. 27, Lane 24, Danshui Road, was implicated in a drug trafficking case involving her neighbor, Hu Chen-shi. She was sentenced to twelve years in prison by the First Special Court. Hu Zhang-shi refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The hearing has concluded, and yesterday, Judge Yu Hua, accompanied by associate judges Nie and Cai, opened the court to announce the verdict: the original judgment was revoked, and Hu Zhang-shi was acquitted.

### Bus Accident; Company Provides Compensation to Family; Company Compensates Deceased's Mother with 500 Yuan; Deceased's Brother Accepted as Apprentice and Provided with Education

Peng Xuehuang, a native of Yangzhou, used to drive the No. 385 bus for the Public Bus Company. At 9:30 AM on the 15th of this month, Peng was driving bus No. 15003 eastward on Xinza Road. When the bus reached near Wenzhou Road, a cyclist suddenly fell in front of the bus. Peng urgently tried to avoid him, but due to the rainy weather and slippery road, the front of the bus swerved sharply to the north, knocking down an electric pole and a water hydrant, and killing a pedestrian named Zhang Amao (17 years old, from Nanxiang). Afterward, the Xinza Police Station moved the body to the coroner's office and filed a public prosecution against Peng. Yesterday morning, Peng was summoned to the First Special Court, and police attorney Li Zhishan presented the case. However, regarding the private prosecution part attached by the plaintiff, the Public Bus Company's annual legal advisors, lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Qian Guangzhong, and the plaintiff's lawyer, Yu Xiangqin, reached a settlement, returning 500 yuan to the plaintiff, the deceased's mother, and accepting the deceased's second son, Zhang Shuxian, age ten, into the Public Bus Company as an apprentice, providing education as a condition. Both parties had no objections. Judge Chuan then questioned the defendant and announced that the verdict would be pronounced on the 28th of this month.

### German Firm Kumpst Sued by Chinese Manager; Gao Zhaoyuan Sues for Commission and Guarantee Money; Court Orders Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation, Hearing Postponed

German national Xie Fu (transliteration), the legal representative of the German firm Kumpst, was recently sued by Gao Zhaoyuan, the former Chinese manager of the firm's oil department, who hired lawyers Ma Shouhua and Li Zongpei to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering payment of commissions and return of guarantee money totaling 30,087.82 yuan. The facts of the lawsuit were that the plaintiff had previously served as the Chinese manager of the defendant's oil department, based on a contract. He has now resigned, but upon settlement of accounts, the defendant owes the plaintiff a large amount of commissions and guarantee money. (1) Regarding the unpaid commissions over the years, this refers to the commissions that should have been paid over the years but were overdue, totaling 3,647.90 yuan from 1931 to 1936, as detailed in the Clear Account Statement of Unpaid Commissions over the Years. This statement was compiled by checking the invoices for each transaction of the defendant. The defendant has an invoice for each transaction, and commissions are calculated based on the invoices. Now, after checking, it was found that many transactions were not paid commissions, and it should be ordered to present the invoices and account books for verification, which will be clear after reading. (2) Regarding the underpaid commissions over the years, this refers to the commissions that were underpaid based on the value of the goods stated on the invoices and the commission percentage stipulated in the contract, totaling 13,367.47 yuan from 1932 to 1937. According to the contract, commissions should be paid according to the value of the goods stated on the invoices and the agreed percentage, as stipulated in Article 11 of the contract. Now, it was found that many transactions did not calculate commissions based on the value of the goods stated on the invoices and the agreed percentage. For example, if the value of the goods stated on the invoice was 523.64 yuan, the defendant actually calculated it as 497.46 yuan; if the agreed percentage was 4.75%, the defendant actually calculated it as 3%. There are many such cases. (3) Regarding the recently owed commissions and salaries, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant on October 31st of last year to resign, and the defendant replied on November 2nd of the same year approving the resignation. According to Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the contract, the termination of employment should be at the end of January of this year. Now, the defendant has withheld the plaintiff's due commissions and salaries for October, November, December of last year and January of this year, totaling 3,837.10 yuan, on various pretexts. (4) Regarding the return of the guarantee money deposited over the years, the plaintiff successively deposited a total of 9,235.35 yuan of guarantee money in the defendant's firm, with 23 receipts issued by the defendant as evidence. This guarantee money should be returned in full when the contract is canceled. However, after repeated requests, the defendant tried to deny it on various pretexts. Based on the above, it is requested that the defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiff a total of 30,087.82 yuan, including the guarantee money of 9,235.35 yuan, and statutory interest, etc. Yesterday morning, this case was heard in the Second Civil Tribunal by Judge Li Hu, with the plaintiff represented by lawyers Ma and Li, who detailed the above situation. The defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that according to the contract, arbitration must be carried out first, so the plaintiff cannot file a lawsuit. Judge Li ruled that the case be heard again on May 12th, instructing both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court. It is heard that the plaintiff has applied for preservation of evidence, which has been approved by the court.

### Landlord Uses Thuggish Tactics to Force Rent Payment; Illegally Detains Tenant; Zhang Zengfu Detained and Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment as a Warning

Pan Jilong, a 55-year-old man from Changzhou, rented the house at No. 46, Lane 401, Dengtuo Road, from Zhang Zengfu (also known as Zhang Zhiqing), a Shanghai native residing at No. 40 of the same lane, for a monthly rent of 14 yuan. Before the August 13th Incident, Pan owed rent of about 100 yuan. After the war broke out, Pan fled back to his hometown. He returned to Shanghai in November 1938 and returned to his old residence. Recently, Zhang repeatedly demanded that Pan pay the outstanding rent. However, Pan stated that he was in financial difficulty and could not pay for the time being, so he negotiated with Zhang to pay after the situation stabilized. Unexpectedly, Zhang colluded with a staff member surnamed Liu of the puppet organization Fuxingban, intending to use their influence to forcibly demand payment, but it was ineffective. On the 23rd of the month, at 9:00 PM, Zhang and Liu dragged Pan into the Linping Road police station of the puppet municipal government. Without asking for reasons, they detained Pan. On the morning of the 24th, Pan's daughter-in-law, Zhang-shi, reported to the Huishan Police Station. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the puppet police station on Linniu Road, and found the Japanese advisor. The Japanese advisor severely reprimanded the police station chief for improperly managing the matter and detaining people without authorization. Pan was released immediately. The detectives then arrested Zhang Zengfu and sent him to the Fourth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police Attorney Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit for the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 304 of the Criminal Law, stating that if Zhang believed that Pan had indeed owed rent, he could legally pursue legal action in court, and should not use thuggish tactics to detain people. It should be requested to be severely punished according to law. Zhang did not deny it. Judge Meng Tingke announced the verdict: Zhang Zengfu was sentenced to three years imprisonment.

### Two Cars Collide; Westerner Dies Tragically; Two Women Also Seriously Injured

At around 9:40 PM last night on Broadway, Hongkou, a bus operated by the Japanese authorities collided with a private black-plated car driven by a Westerner named Hiller. As a result, both cars were severely damaged. Hiller, the driver, died instantly due to fatal injuries. Hiller's wife, who was in the same car, suffered serious head injuries and was sent to the Country Hospital by police patrol car. Lu Baowen, an 18-year-old female ticket seller on the bus from Ningbo, also suffered head injuries. Ambulance No. 82 was called to the scene and she was transported to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries were serious and her life was in danger. At the same time, a Western police officer named Wensha also had his left foot crushed and was sent to the Country Hospital for treatment.

### Gambling Den Broken Up at Zhongnan Hotel

Yesterday, a detective chief of the Laoza Police Station of the Public Concession learned that a gambling den was being set up in Room 411 on the fourth floor of the Zhongnan Hotel at the northern end of the Dongxin Bridge on Edward Road. He immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives and Japanese police detectives, totaling thirty or forty people, to rush to the hotel entrance in red police cars. They swarmed into Room 411 on the fourth floor and broke up a gambling operation set up by Chaozhou people (namely, Qinglong Baihu Si Men), who were enthusiastically gambling. The detectives arrested a total of twenty-nine gamblers on the spot, and transported them and the gambling equipment to the Laoza Police Station by car, pending interrogation by the First Special Court this morning. It is said that this was the second time a gambling den had been broken up.

### A Woman of Loose Morals; The Romantic History of Cheng Ying; Eleventh Husband Sued and Convicted; Factory Owner's Wife Accuses Cheng of Enticing Adultery

Zhao Liyuan, the owner of a well-drilling factory in Jiangyin, saw an advertisement in the newspaper in early September two years ago in which Ms. Cheng Ying modestly sought cohabitation, and the only condition was that she could afford to support her. He responded to the advertisement, and after a meeting, they were very compatible, so they began to cohabit. By January of this year, the two sides had a falling out, and Cheng Ying filed a criminal complaint against Zhao for fraud, seduction, bodily harm, and obstruction of freedom. As a result of the first instance, Zhao Liyuan was legally warned by the First Special District Local Court. Zhao refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but still failed. Therefore, Zhao's wife, Yi-shi, started anew, and hired lawyer Shen Ronghua to file a criminal self-accusation in the First Special Court, accusing Cheng Ying of enticing her husband Zhao Liyuan to commit adultery. The complaint stated that she married Zhao Liyuan as his wife on January 21st of the Republic of China 17th year, and had already given birth to four children. Last November, her husband sold the house on Malong Road and moved to the Liyuan well-drilling factory on Haifang Road, and when she saw the defendant cohabiting with her husband in the factory, she realized they were committing adultery. Later, after reading the court's judgment on the case of her husband being accused by the defendant of harming public morals, she learned that the adultery occurred due to the defendant's advertisement seeking friends for cohabitation. It was found that her husband had lost nearly half a million yuan in property since being enticed to commit adultery, causing the whole family to be heartbroken. She originally wanted to sue her husband Zhao Liyuan in the same case, but considering that Zhao had already suffered mental pain and economic losses, she forgave him and only requested that the defendant Cheng Ying be summoned and punished according to law. It is understood that Ms. Cheng is indeed over thirty years old, and her cohabitation with Zhao Liyuan is her eleventh husband. This woman not only widely placed "surface leaders" but also loved to prepare many nicknames. In addition to Cheng Ying, Cheng Yanbai, Cheng Biru, Cheng Tongyun, Cheng Ying, etc., are all her aliases. From the first to the eighth husband, most of them were small bureaucrats. The ninth was Tao Jianhua, who once served as the inspector-general of the Jiangsu Anti-Smoking Bureau. He had no reputation at first, but after the National Army moved west, he raised the anti-Japanese banner in the Pudong area, repeatedly defeating the enemy, and is now a county magistrate and commander of the guerrillas. Her tenth husband was the doctor Wei Guangcai. Cheng graduated from the Cihang Midwifery School, obtaining this like-minded "straw sandals," and should have been able to grow old together. Unexpectedly, they still separated and reunited, posted advertisements to find another target, and Zhao Liyuan became her eleventh guest. But in the end, they couldn't stay together forever. This is a rare and strange continuation in the history of modern marriage. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Zhao Xuan-shi, was represented in court by her lawyer, Shen Ronghua, who stated the intention of the prosecution and submitted photos of the defendant Cheng Ying when she married others in the past, as well as newspapers containing various past events of the woman, to prove the defendant's romantic behavior. When the defendant was questioned in court, she admitted that she posted an advertisement seeking friends and Zhao Liyuan voluntarily came to her home to apply and then cohabited. Later, she moved with Zhao to the factory he opened, etc., without denying it. However, she firmly stated that she did not know that Zhao had a wife at first, and that before cohabiting, she had personally gone to the factory to investigate, and the workers in the factory said that the factory owner had never had a wife. It was not she who enticed Zhao, but Zhao who enticed her, etc. After the defendant's lawyer, Li Gengxiang, debated with the plaintiff's lawyer, Judge Zhan ruled that the verdict would be announced at a later date.

### Outerwear Stained by Car Wheel; Bowl Thrown in Attack; Chen Qianchang Seriously Injured in Head

Chen Qianchang, a 31-year-old Ningbo native who works as a deliveryman for the Nan Wanfeng (Datonghang) tobacco and paper shop at No. 501 Fuxu Road, was riding a bicycle yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 PM to withdraw 1,500 yuan from the Guanghua Bank on Tianjin Road. He then turned into the Ningbo Road Tobacco Guild to deliver the money. Just a few steps from his destination, a pedestrian in a blue cloth gown, nearly thirty years old, carrying a vegetable basket with a red-flowered bowl inside, was walking in the middle of the road. Chen, fearing that he would bump into the person, rang his bicycle bell several times, but the pedestrian acted as if he had not heard. As a result, the tire soiled his outerwear. The two sides started arguing, and after arguing for a long time, the pedestrian grabbed a bowl from the basket and threw it at Chen's head. Chen was unable to avoid it in time, resulting in a head injury with blood flowing, and the bowl shattered. At this time, several old clerks from the Tobacco Guild who knew him came and helped to arrest the assailant, and called the police to send the injured person to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Yarn and Cotton; Sales of Chinese Yarn Surge in Tianjin; Japanese Yarn Prices Soar Wildly

The yarn market first fell and then rose, and continued to advance. Although the situation in Shantou was tense and demand was sluggish, purchasing in Hong Kong turned prosperous again. Tianjin merchants in the north, who have always specialized in Japanese yarn, have recently been buying up the products of Tianjin Hengyuan and Beiyang factories, such as 20-count Sanding, Baxian, and 17-count Sanding yarn, due to the lower price of Chinese yarn. As a result, morale was boosted and the market strengthened. The intentions of inland merchants also changed, and the business of local yarn turned from weak to strong, and selling prices were increased instead. In the afternoon, most people believed that Japanese yarn was expensive and the cotton mills on this street had already switched to using Chinese yarn. They were optimistic about the market. 20-count Shuangma yarn was being sold for 400 yuan, but the factory continued to open up in large quantities. However, the peers were enthusiastic and bought it all up.

The situation of spot yarn: when the market first opened yesterday morning, it was reported that Wenzhou Oujiang was automatically blockaded, port cargo transportation was stagnant, and Japanese warships were causing disturbances in Fujian Province. Morale was not good, and everyone discussed having a small face and the opening price fell by 2 yuan. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 396.5 yuan, and the stack unit price was 393.5 yuan. Soon after, Guangbang agents representing Hong Kong helped continue to purchase, and the market situation suddenly became tight and rose. Purchase prices rose step by step. Tianjin merchants from the north bought up Tianjin goods again, and morale was even higher. Sales prices gradually rose again. By the closing price, 20-count Shuangma yarn was being sold for 399.5 yuan, and the stack unit price was 395.5 yuan. The market situation was even stronger when the market opened in the afternoon. Demand from inland was not weak, and the spot price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 400 yuan, up another 5 jiao. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,935 packages throughout the day. The market price of 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by 1.5 yuan, and other yarn remained stable as usual. The Xinsheng Factory opened 1,120 packages of 20-count Jinhu yarn at a price of 386 yuan. The Chongxin Factory opened 150 packages of 20-count Dafa yarn at a price of 390 yuan. The Yongan Factory opened 150 packages of 20-count Tejincheng yarn at a price of 407.5 yuan. The Defeng Factory opened 800 packages of 10-count Shuangshi yarn at a price of 308 yuan. Today, 610 pieces of yarn will be transported to Tianjin. The amount bought by each gang is listed on the left.

Hong Kong 455 Peers 555

Shantou 100 Tianjin 515

Yunnan 50 Inland 210

North gang 50 Total 1,935

The market price of Japanese yarn is soaring, and the market situation is very chaotic. There are often price fluctuations of several yuan in all the open markets. According to the market, this time it is all the Tianjin gang and the Qingdao gang who are in a bullish position and are squeezing very hard, so the rising trend is still like drunk and crazy. The price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 375 yuan this month, and there is a saying that the price for the next month will be squeezed to 380 yuan.

### US Cotton Export Subsidy To Be Implemented Starting July 1st, But Most Legislators Have Not Yet Agreed

The price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, rose again yesterday by five to six pounds sterling due to heavy buying of swaps and by banks in the market in May. A Washington source, Congressman Penk Hai, said that US President Roosevelt has agreed to this cotton export subsidy bill. It is tentatively set that for new cotton exports this year, 7 million bales can receive an export subsidy of 2 cents per pound from the government. This bill will be implemented starting July 1st and will be valid for one year. Exporters can request the government to provide cash or loans to store cotton, but most legislators do not agree with this subsidy plan, fearing that cotton prices will plummet and new cotton will be repeatedly used as collateral for loans. However, according to Penk Hai, this new plan can promote new cotton exports and will not be used for loans, while cotton prices will rise and hover around nine cents. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell one rupee including forecasts, Egyptian cotton was unchanged. Converted to legal tender, US cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 3 jiao, Indian cotton fell by 4 jiao, and Egyptian cotton was different.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet, mainly because there were many foreign cotton arrivals. According to reporter investigations, each factory has enough raw cotton of 10s and 20s counts to use for three months. However, raw materials of 32s counts and above are very scarce, and very few of these raw materials are being shipped. If the US cotton export subsidy can be realized, then each factory can purchase US cotton. The following is the conversion of yesterday's cotton market to delivery to the factories:

The local cotton business is still sustainable, but a large amount of provincial fees still lack vitality. This is because a batch of Indian cotton ordered by each factory has arrived in Shanghai this month, and the factories have ample supply. They have no intention of trying expensive local cotton, so recent transactions are still sluggish. 3,000 bales of Zhejiang cotton were scheduled to arrive in Shanghai, but they have been affected by the Jiang blockade and have not yet arrived in Shanghai today. Cotton merchants from the Subei area have made every effort to dredge, transporting 731 bales, with asking prices of 77.70 to 78.70 yuan. Also, 100 pieces of cotton arrived from Xingang yesterday. The situation of each cotton is listed on the left:

### Oil Market Raw Soybean Oil Repeatedly Sees New High Prices Raw Soybean Oil Has Risen Sixteen Yuan Since January Raw Oil at 5 Jiao Per Jin, Soybean Oil at 4 Jiao 8 Yesterday, 3,400 Pieces Were Shipped From Qinglian

Yesterday, the raw soybean oil market consistently fell by one or two yuan, but its highest price set a new record. Dalian soybean oil reached 49 yuan, and Jiaozhou raw oil was 45 yuan, compared to the same day last month. Dalian soybean oil rose 16.70 yuan (selling price on March 24 was 32.30 yuan), and Jiaosheng oil rose 16 yuan (29 yuan). Currently, people's hearts are still excited. Yesterday's small correction is not enough to affect the pursuit of speculators, so the public's life will inevitably have a day of vegetables without oil. Yesterday, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were opened, priced at 44 to 45 yuan, and the northern standard price was 58.50 to 59 yuan. 150 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded, priced at 35.50 to 36 yuan. 50 large baskets of Lianqi soybean oil were traded, priced at 46 to 46.50 yuan. More than 200 barrels of Dalian barrel soybean oil were traded, priced at 48 to 49 yuan. Yesterday, each jin of raw oil from the oil shops sold for 5 jiao 1 fen, soybean oil for 4 jiao 8 fen, and vegetable oil for 3 jiao 8 fen.

On March 24, 700 pieces of soybean oil were imported from Dalian and 250 pieces from Qingdao, 1,780 pieces of raw oil from Qingdao, and 700 pieces of vegetable oil from Qingdao.

### Securities Domestic Debt Weakens Again Chinese Business Common Stock Is Almost Worthless

The over-the-counter securities market was slightly depressed yesterday. This was mostly due to the blockade of Ouhai, which caused people's hearts to be slightly disturbed. However, as it was unrelated to the official price, it stabilized in the afternoon and remained in a hovering state. People's hearts were slightly dazed, and retail investors slightly increased their selling. Large institutional investors remained steadfast, and the trend will temporarily hover without major fluctuations. Yesterday's trend: Tian Sheng Run Li opened in the morning and was sold at a bargained price. Da Tong, Tong Kang, and No. 12 were all sold, but buyers were not enthusiastic. San Kai, Heng Fu, Yong Kang, Zhen Kang, and No. 42 were all in demand, but these were all scattered transactions, so supply and demand were uneven. It fell slightly by 4 or 5 jiao in the morning. Transactions were clearer in the afternoon. No. 42 continued to buy in, and Yong Kang and Tong Kang also had considerable demand. Yong Feng was the main seller, and Xing Yuan and No. 35 slightly reduced their holdings. The market was firmer. The total result was a slight decrease of 4 jiao to 5 jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was estimated at more than 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock transactions: More than 80 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 6 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen.

The public exchange stock market was very deserted, but people's hearts were still firm. Although the German parliament's declaration this Friday was ahead, sellers did not seek to sell because of this. Jardine and Ruidong shares were outstanding. Ruidong shares rose to 7 yuan 05 fen. Public bus shares reached a new high price of 27 yuan (ex-dividend).

Today, I read the reorganization plan of China Business Company. According to calculations, the common stock is almost worthless. However, it is still specially allowed to account for about 2% of the new capital (that is, every 20 old shares are converted into one new share). This plan seems to be approved by the public. As for the 8% bonds of the company and the accumulated interest, they are distributed as 10 yuan new common shares. The new shares are currently worth about 5 yuan, so every 100 taels of bonds can have a value of 67 taels.

### Finance Cash Is Being Dumped At All Sides The Last Seller Shouted A Price of 2,063 Yuan

Yesterday's cash bullion over-the-counter market was quite stagnant and meaningless, because the public had no interest and was waiting for the reaction of the situation's evolution. However, the situation was slightly weak. Although a certain silver shop acted on behalf of the Hong Kong gang to absorb purchases, the silver shops were selling heavily, and other firms imitated their actions, causing the potential to weaken. By noon, the price had fallen to 2,069 yuan. In the afternoon, merchants and speculators were more eager to sell, and buyers were cautious, so the situation became even weaker. It was said that the last seller shouted a price of 2,063 or 2,064 yuan to sell. As a result, it fell by 5 jiao according to the closing price at noon, but in fact, it had fallen by 5 or 6 yuan. People's hearts were weak, and transactions were dull. Only about 400 taels were traded in the morning, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. Silver ornaments in silver shops remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.

Bullion over-the-counter market fell by 5 jiao

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (10 taels) had no transactions for a long time due to scarce supply and demand. Until 9:50, the first transaction was 20 taels between money changers, with an opening price of 2,071 yuan, 1 yuan and 5 jiao higher than the end of last week. After the opening, although a certain silver shop acted on behalf of the Hong Kong gang to absorb purchases, the amount was limited, and silver shops and gold shops were selling heavily, so the situation was slightly weak. A silver shop sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop, with the same price as the morning opening. Then, a silver shop sold another 50 taels to a certain silver shop, priced at 70 yuan. At the same price, a silver shop sold 50 taels to a gold shop. Later, a certain gold shop also sold 50 taels to a cash shop and a money changer each, with the price still at 70 yuan. After that, money changers traded 50 taels with each other, with the price at 69 yuan. Soon, a silver shop sold 50 taels to a money changer, with the price at the same price. After that, supply and demand were quiet, and there were no transactions until noon, so the closing price at noon was still 69 yuan. In the afternoon, merchants and speculators were eager to sell, and buyers were temporarily cautious, so the situation became even weaker. Although the seller's price was shouted down to 63 or 64 yuan, it was still difficult to find a buyer. No transaction was seen until the evening closing. If the closing price at noon was 2,069 yuan, the result was a decrease of 5 jiao compared to last Saturday. The difference for the whole day was only 2 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,070 yuan, and the buying price was 2,060 yuan. The current gold standard was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.

Silver ornaments in silver shops remain unchanged

The exchange price of silver ornaments in silver shops per tael remains unchanged. Da Tong Hang is still 210 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang is 208 yuan, with a buying price of 202 yuan.

Sino-British pure gold remains stagnant

The buying price of Chinese cash by the Central Bank is 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold price is unchanged at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price is also still 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao, which is due to the fact that the London telegram on the 22nd stated that British pure gold was still stable, with each ounce fixed at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 and a half pence.

### Foreign Exchange Market No Change

Although major foreign banks were competing with each other in the foreign exchange market yesterday, British and American foreign banks were still willing to provide funds, and export firms and Bombay silver companies once slightly sold. Therefore, the process became more stable, and the results were all flat. However, the process was still calm and there were very few changes. Trading was still active. Although speculators and non-professionals were dumping Hong Kong exchange, Chinese and foreign banks were still absorbing strongly, so the supply and demand were equal. Therefore, the results were also not divided into success or failure.

At the beginning of the morning, London's major terms remained unchanged, and the forward term continued to shrink by 0.0625. New York's silver price remained stagnant, and London's raw gold had no rise or fall. The exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar, against Shanghai, and against France was flat. The US dollar was 0.0625 against the British pound, and still flat against Shanghai and France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price was 8 pence 25 for the British pound and 16 yuan 0.0625 for the US dollar, with no success or failure compared to the end of last week. After the opening, although foreign banks came to compete, the British bank HSBC was willing to supply, so the situation was stable. HSBC's listed price was unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also unchanged, remaining at 5.00%. After that, an export firm suddenly sold the spot US dollar at 16 yuan 0.09375 to an import firm, so the potential became more stable. Subsequently, an import firm slightly purchased the spot US dollar at 16 yuan 0.0625 from a certain bank. Near noon, transactions became clearer. Only Hong Kong exchange was slightly traded. A speculator sold the spot Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan to a Chinese bank, and the situation was also flat. By the time the bank's selling price closed at noon, the British and American currencies were the same as the morning opening.

In the afternoon, a foreign bank first competed with the British bank HSBC for the spot British pound at 8 pence 25. Then, the Bombay Silver Company suddenly dumped the spot US dollar at 16 yuan 0.09375 to a certain bank, so the situation became more stable. After that, a foreign firm, Holland-China Trading, sold the spot Hong Kong dollar at 56 yuan to a foreign bank, and the situation was still quite stable. By the time the bank's spot selling price closed in the evening, the British pound was 8 pence 25, the US dollar was 16 yuan 0.0625, and the Hong Kong dollar was 56 yuan. As a result, there was no difference between the British, American, and Hong Kong currencies compared to the noon closing last week.

Yesterday, foreign exchange in the local area of this port, foreign banks settled their accounts very actively, and the banks' supply was very smooth. The market price was stable and unchanged. Bullion dealers and money changers slightly supplied funds. The demand from customers and retail investors was not smooth, and the trend hovered. In the afternoon, the silver shop's customers and others were eager to sell, and the buyers' asking price was very harsh, so no transactions were made. The trend was weak. The demand for foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds was very scarce. The supply and demand for British and American gold notes was still strong, with the British currency weak and the US dollar stable. The demand for Hong Kong notes, French francs, Siamese notes, and Dutch notes was relatively strong, and the market price rose slightly. There was a supply of German gold notes, and the price trend was weak. The demand for Australian gold notes had decreased and had dropped to the old price.

### Piece Goods With The Blockade Of Wenzhou The Outlet For Domestic Cloth Becomes More Deserted Eastern Piece Goods and Northern Sales Are More Active

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday's market was in contrast to Dongbu cloth, due to the blockade of Wenzhou, the sudden halt of freight, the evacuation of the population and materials from Shantou and Chaozhou, and the sudden decline in the stomach. Therefore, actual demand is becoming more calm and people are relaxing. However, the demand in Sichuan, Yunnan, and the hemp chapter and Leizhou Beihai areas of Guangdong is still strong, and 6,000-odd pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, bleached cloth, and printed satin have been traded. The waterway freight in the guerrilla areas of Jiangnan, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, and other places is prosperous, and more than 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, and poplin have been added. More than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and poplin were handled in Subei, Dongtai, Taizhou, and other places. The sales of bleached and dyed cloth are generally the same as before, and although the opening price of white coarse cloth was about 1 jiao higher per piece than last Saturday, the market was again chaotic due to the cheap sale of hand goods, and transactions were scattered. The wholesale shops on this street handled more than 100 packages, and transactions of fine cloth and fine twill were also weak, and prices fell slightly. The Minbang area is uneasy due to the fierce bombing of Japanese aircraft, and the Gong Sheng incident has not been resolved. The purchase and loading of various goods has been postponed. The Tianjin gang in the northern route is urging the loading of reserved goods, and the intention to purchase new goods such as striped element poplin and striped bleached cloth is slightly weak.

Dongbu Cloth

White cloth and fine twill, due to the active sales market in the northern route, and the Qingdao telegraph that each piece has soared by 3 jiao, the hearts of the people in this city are unanimously high. The Tianjin and Qingdao gangs raised prices in the morning and absorbed more than 700 packages of various brands of fine cloth and fine twill, which were all increased by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao compared with last Saturday's market. The market then slightly returned 2.5 fen. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth was opened at 13 yuan 3 jiao, and futures for the next month required 13 yuan 4 jiao. A total of more than 1,000 pieces were traded on this street, and each firm sold about 1,000 pieces of next month's goods, mostly Longtou, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and Feiyu brands. The selling price of Caiqiu was 13 yuan 5 jiao, Yanghe 13 yuan 4 jiao and a half, and Feiyu 13 yuan 5 jiao. The market atmosphere was quite firm.

Export

On the 25th, 220 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin and 185 pieces to Yantai.

White Goods of Wool Fabric Are Expensive

Yesterday, the wool fabric market, all goods occupied an advantage, especially the white goods that are needed for summer sales, such as white serge, white zhigong, white canvas, fan erding, screw fabric, Vienna fabric, hemp plastic cloth, fat biequ, yellow twill, barre fabric, feather yarn fabric, white flannel, etc., the market atmosphere was even more tense, and the asking price was also high, because the exchange rate was short, the cost increased, and domestic goods and Chinese textiles also soared due to the sharp increase in raw material prices, and the output was less than before. The source of Japanese goods has also been greatly reduced. Therefore, although a large number of British products were imported, the sellers were unwilling to let go. At the moment, except for white serge and white zhigong, the remaining goods have already been traded. Yesterday, white flannel was sold in batches for 12 yuan 5 jiao per yard, feather yarn fabric No. 1 was 8 yuan, No. 2 was 7 yuan 2 jiao and a half, No. 3 was 6 yuan 4 jiao, and No. 4 was 4 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen.

### Grains Foreign Flour Continues To Rise Local Flour Mills' Prices Remain Unchanged

Flour Yesterday, the transaction of spot flour in this factory, although it was the beginning of the week, the sales still felt ordinary. After the market opened in the morning, the Jin merchants seemed to be more active, but the sales to the major customers were still difficult to be smooth, because the prices in Beiyang and Surabaya have recently rebounded, but the market price rises and falls are too erratic, so the general transportation merchants dare not risk too much. Therefore, the sales to Beiyang were mostly scattered, and the sales to Nanyang were also the same. The total transaction volume of various brands of factory flour in the market was about 50,000 bags. Except for about 8,000 bags of retail in this street, the rest were sold to Beiyang, Nanyang, and various inland routes.

### A Record of a Conversation Between Two Guests

— Yu Songyun

Last evening, two unexpected guests arrived. After the pleasantries, the first guest suddenly stated that being a doctor was a better profession than others, as it quickly led to a life of comfort and wealth. Just as I was about to speak, the second guest defended doctors, saying that being a doctor was difficult. Had he not seen the endless stream of medical malpractice cases in recent years? The first guest then asked a strange question: "Suppose a doctor performs a proper surgery on a patient, and the patient dies during the surgery. What then?" The second guest replied, "This can only be resolved by the court. It must be investigated to determine the cause of death, whether the doctor acted intentionally, or if not intentional, whether they were negligent. If intentional, they should be charged with murder; if negligent, they should be charged with manslaughter; if the death was unavoidable, then there is no guilt." The first guest said, "However, suppose the patient's family consults with a lawyer, who intimidates the doctor into a settlement. The doctor, perhaps unaware of the law, is fooled and submits meekly, obeying their demands, whether it be being barred from practicing in the area, or being required to pay for the life of the deceased and the emotional distress of the living. Is this acceptable?" The second guest replied, "No, such a thing is impossible. Lawyers are law-abiding and would never act like the malicious lawyers of the past." Hearing this, I sighed at the first guest's far-fetched ideas. I had never heard of such a situation, and it likely never existed. After the guests left, I pondered their words! I couldn't help but shudder. The idea of being barred from practicing in the area was especially shocking. Even if a doctor committed a crime under Article 276, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, their practice could only be revoked after a final judgment, in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations for Medical Practitioners. It could never be settled privately through intimidation, nor could their practice be revoked through a private contract. When doctors treat patients, they certainly do not intend to cause death. Whether there was negligence in their practice requires various evidence, with pathological autopsy evidence being especially important. In the case of death during surgery, setting aside the perspectives of both human sentiment and the law, the cause of death must be investigated. Therefore, doctors who experience such an unfortunate event must rely on the judgment of the law. If the negligence is their own, they must accept the punishment of the law. However, death during surgery has many causes and may not always be the doctor's fault. Trying to suppress the matter and seize someone's life would be a grave mistake, creating an excuse for others, potentially leading to financial ruin. Alas, if that were the case, being a doctor would be difficult indeed.

### Blood Pressure in Healthy People

— Xie Yunshou

The more civilized the world becomes, the more complex human affairs become. Consequently, human diseases also increase. Cases of stroke are frequently seen in newspapers, drawing public attention to blood pressure, as high blood pressure often leads to stroke. Therefore, I will describe the blood pressure of healthy people as follows:

Blood pressure refers to the pressure exerted on the walls of blood vessels when the heart pumps blood into them. At this time, the vessel walls are tense and subject to a certain pressure, which is called blood pressure. This pressure exists in arteries, veins, and capillaries, but the commonly referred to blood pressure is arterial blood pressure. Arterial blood pressure can be further divided into three types: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure. Systolic blood pressure is the highest pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts and is commonly referred to as blood pressure. When the heart expands, the pressure decreases. This pressure is called diastolic blood pressure. The difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure is called pulse pressure or pulse amplitude. The instrument used to measure blood pressure is called a sphygmomanometer, which comes in mercury and aneroid types, but the principle is the same. The numbers displayed indicate millimeters of mercury.

The average blood pressure of healthy people is as follows:

            Men     Women

Systolic Blood Pressure  111-130   101-130

Diastolic Blood Pressure 51-80    46-80

Pulse Pressure  50-60    50-60

The ratio of the differences between the three is approximately 3:2:1.

However, blood pressure in healthy people is not constant and can vary depending on the following factors:

1. Age: Blood pressure increases with age. This is shown below:

Reading the table below reveals that systolic blood pressure is very low in children under ten. After ten, it is close to that of adults. After fifty, although the cause of increased blood pressure is difficult to identify, it increases somewhat.

2. Weight: The higher the body weight, the higher the blood pressure.

3. Height: The taller the body, the higher the blood pressure.

4. Gender: Women generally have lower blood pressure than men. In Europeans, the difference is about 7.5-10 millimeters of mercury.

5. Daily Variations: Blood pressure is lowest in the morning and gradually rises, reaching its peak between 3 PM and 7 PM, then decreases again. However, this varies with individual lifestyles.

6. Sleep: Blood pressure decreases significantly during sleep, especially deep sleep.

7. Exercise: Blood pressure increases during exercise and decreases during rest.

8. Mental State: Blood pressure often increases during mental excitement or painful stimulation.

9. Diet: Blood pressure generally rises after eating due to stomach expansion and increased abdominal pressure. Blood pressure rises again about three hours later due to visceral nerve tension and the absorption of digestive components. Blood pressure rises noticeably about half an hour after drinking alcohol.

10. Climate: In warm weather, blood vessels dilate and blood pressure decreases. In cold weather, blood vessels constrict and blood pressure increases.

11. Effects of Cold Water Baths: During cold water baths, blood vessels constrict and blood pressure rises noticeably. After the bath, skin blood vessels reflexively dilate, and blood pressure decreases again.

12. Effects of Warm Baths: Initially, blood vessels constrict due to warm water stimulation, causing blood pressure to rise. Later, blood vessels dilate, and blood pressure decreases again.

13. Effects of Menstruation: Women with heavy menstrual flow may experience a temporary decrease in blood pressure of 15 millimeters of mercury.

14. Effects of Disease: Blood pressure increases significantly in cases of nephritis, atrophic kidney, and arteriosclerosis.

### Dietary Nourishment and Hygiene in Medicine

— Ye Jun

From the moment a person is born, drinking mother's milk as an infant and gradually eating porridge, gruel, rice, bread, wheat cakes, and other adult foods, food is indispensable every day of one's life. Therefore, the issue of food and human life is of great importance.

Those who eat meat and exercise little will inevitably become obese. Obesity is a disease caused by insufficient vegetables and a lack of exercise. Those who labor physically or mentally but lack food will inevitably become emaciated. Emaciation is caused by a failure to choose nutritious and inexpensive foods like beans. In my clinical practice, I often find it strange that people put their useful bodies in an unhealthy state. This state is partly due to environmental factors, but also because individuals do not pay attention to the nutritional foods from which their resources and strength come. Instead, they leave everything to illiterate cooks, considering fried and braised dishes as delicacies. This is truly lamentable. Anyone who has studied chemistry knows that in addition to protein, fats, and carbohydrates, humans also need various vitamins, which are essential for life. These vitamins decompose into waste products when exposed to high heat. I dare not advocate semi-cooked food in a society lacking knowledge of bacteriology, but I hope that people will consider the nutritional foods that their bodies need and not blindly regard delicacies as treasures, thereby wasting nature's gifts and placing excessive strain on their stomachs without benefiting their health. Sometimes, pickled vegetables and light meats like white fish can be nourishing. This is the first point.

The amount of food should be adjusted according to individual physique, labor, mental activity, exercise, etc. However, the distribution of three meals a day should follow the table below:

(1) For breakfast in the morning, it is best to take some liquid and thin items. The reason is that the intestines and stomach have rested for several hours, and adding a large amount of solid food at once will harm digestion. Wealthy families can drink a glass of milk, two eggs, and several slices of bread, which is enough. Economical families can prepare a small stone mill to grind soybeans soaked overnight into soy milk. Use a piece of white cloth to filter the juice for breakfast. It is fresher and better than what you buy. The remaining residue can be stir-fried with bamboo shoots and green vegetables for lunch. It can be eaten for a long time without getting tired of it.

(2) Lunch can be slightly more substantial. Pork, beef, tomatoes, and vegetables are the best dishes to eat with rice. Hygienic rice (i.e., brown rice, because vitamin B exists in it) is the standard. Refined rice only contains carbohydrates. If eaten for a long time without supplementing with other foods containing vitamins, it will inevitably lead to a sallow complexion and thin muscles, or even cause beriberi, leading to heart failure and death. This is a common occurrence.

(3) Dinner should be no more than full. There is an old saying that goes, "Eat less at night, live to ninety-nine." If dinner is too full, it will inevitably tire the stomach and intestines, or even cause the stomach to become weak and sluggish, causing food to remain in the gastrointestinal tract and ferment into toxins. Those who suffer from this will have bad breath and will not be able to get up early, affecting their work during the day, feeling tired and listless.

Now, if the daily adult food intake is two jin [unit of weight], the distribution is as follows:

Breakfast: 6 taels 4 qian [unit of weight]

Lunch: 16 taels

Dinner: 9 taels 6 qian

Attention should be paid to the quality and quantity of food for individual nutrition. This is the second point.

Each person's life, environment, and physique are different. If people are forced to eat a certain amount of meat or fish, monks and nuns will be at a loss. Monks and nuns can also enjoy longevity and health by eating vegetarian food for life. However, from a medical point of view, the distribution of our food should include fats, proteins, carbohydrates, chlorophyll, vitamins, and inorganic salts in appropriate and balanced amounts, as the only way to health and strength. A table is listed below:

Protein: 20%

Fats: 4%

Carbohydrates: 70%

Chlorophyll and fiber: 5%

Inorganic salts: 1%

Vitamins: Rich in content

Now, examples are given below for comparison.

Beef, chicken, mutton, pork, fish, etc.: 7 taels 2 qian

Scallions, radishes, bamboo shoots, celery, taro, potatoes, arrowhead, cucumbers, eggplants, spinach, cabbage, lotus root, tofu, lentils, peas, broad beans, etc.: 2 taels 5 qian

Half a pound of milk or two eggs

White rice, bread, steamed buns, wheat cakes, etc.: 22 taels

However, only upper-class families can enjoy this. For ordinary people, tofu replaces meat, pickled vegetables replace vegetables, and soy milk replaces milk and eggs. During the difficult days of resistance against Japan, it is already fortunate to have this much. This is the third point.

Common Sense of Dietary Nourishment

### Scientific Research on Dietary Nourishment (Continued from Issue 14)

— Zhou Zhenyu

(2) Application of Dietary Nourishment

Since life depends on dietary nourishment, how can its application be ignored without scientific research? Science means that all problems of dietary nourishment, large and small, have evidence to clarify their principles. It is not like the research of ancient people, which was mostly idealistic or abstract. Although there were some that conformed to experiments, they could not be fully believed. Here, the results of scientific research are stated below.

What is dietary nourishment? It is the driving force of the human body. All operations of the human body, moving internally and expressed externally, are manifestations of life. Therefore, where there is life, there must be operation, and where there is operation, there must be dietary nourishment. The relationship between operation and dietary nourishment is close and inseparable, which goes without saying. Moreover, operation is continuous in time, so the supply of driving force must also be continuous. The creation of driving force is like the engine and boiler in a machine factory. Water is placed in the boiler and burned with coal. The water is heated and vaporized, generating force (Energy), which is guided to various parts of the engine, driving the branches and bodies to generate various useful operations, which we utilize to become the most powerful part of industry. Food, from the mouth to the stomach and intestines, undergoes digestion, transforming into a special quality suitable for the human body, which is absorbed by the blood and transported to the muscle systems of various parts of the body. When it encounters oxygen (Oxygen), it generates a chronic combustion called oxidation (Oxidation), keeping the whole body warm and operational without interruption. The boiler is like the human stomach and intestines. Coal and water are like human food. Coal is incinerated, heating the water in the boiler. When the water is heated to a considerable degree, it vaporizes, and the vapor can drive the engine, causing operation. Food combines with oxygen to form oxidation, which is not much different from combustion, except for the difference in speed.

The operation of various parts of the engine is like the operation of various parts of the human body. The ability of the engine to operate (Energy) can be measured, and the ability of the human body to operate can also be measured. For convenience, the value of the amount of heat is used as a unit for the ability to operate, called calorie (Calorie). Calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram (one kilogram) of water by one degree on a centigrade scale, or the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of four pounds of water by one degree on a Celsius scale. In the study of dietary nourishment, the calorie used is mostly one-thousandth of a Calorie. In other words, the calorie used is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram (one centimeter) of water by one degree on a centigrade scale. In science, uppercase and lowercase versions of the letter C are used to indicate the difference. After food is oxidized, it is applied to the human body, and its application function is called metabolism (Metabolism), which will be discussed in a separate article and will not be repeated here.

The source of heat can be traced back to sunlight. The amount of sunlight that the human body can directly use is small, and the amount it uses indirectly is large and mediated by food. Most foods are plants and animals, and the life of plants and animals depends on sunlight. For example, plants can combine the simplest substances, such as the carbon dioxide (CO2) gas exhaled by animals, with water to form a complex organic substance. Its combination must go through a chemical functional effect in the plant body, and the progress of this effect must have sunlight as its driving force. The plant must have chlorophyll as its catalyzer (Catalyzer). Sunlight is applied by the catalyzer to promote the combination of carbon dioxide and water to form carbohydrates (Carbohydrate). Here is a list of its chemical formulas to clarify it: (To be continued)

### An Attempt

— Mao Lie

In the past, people said, "There has never been a successful attempt since ancient times," but Hu Shi said, "Success has always been in attempts." Will attempts ultimately succeed? I am not a relativist, but I have a relative view of attempts: some attempts will succeed, and some will never succeed.

After twenty-two months of resistance against Japan, China is attempting a counter-offensive. This attempt is certain to succeed. We see the news from these past two or three weeks. Since the counter-offensive was attempted, there have been numerous achievements that have shaken our ears and eyes. The most prominent examples are the two recoveries of Kaifeng, the repeated victories in northern Jiangxi, the annihilation of tens of thousands of enemy soldiers, and the tightening siege of Guangzhou, which seems poised to fall in one fell swoop. Based on this, if one day the enemy is exhausted and we launch a general counter-offensive with our well-rested elite forces, how could they not collapse at the mere sight of us? Although the enemy can still hold out for now, and we are not yet fully prepared, we are only testing their strength, but the certainty of final victory has increased significantly. Success is in the attempt, which is inevitable here.

But at the same time, they are also attempting something. They are attempting to seek peace. This attempt is certain to fail. They are in a situation where they have mounted a tiger and cannot dismount, so they can only repeatedly release the air of seeking peace as an attempt. Recently, they have even entrusted a third country to mediate peace. However, they are still singing the praises of the East Asian New Order and still dreaming of being the masters of East Asia. In other words, they still have not regretted their evil deeds and abandoned their aggression. Such peace-seeking is not asking us to surrender to them? Using peace-seeking as a means, and demanding our surrender as the goal, this attempt is simply going south while heading north, how can it work? The unsuccessful attempt will naturally become an irreversible ironclad case.

From this, it can be seen that reasonable and planned attempts, such as engaging in inventions for civil service exams, will succeed. Absurd, irrational, and reckless attempts, such as speculation or gambling, will not succeed. Our counter-offensive attempt belongs to the former, which everyone knows. Their peace-seeking attempt belongs to the latter, which even elementary school students know. Who will succeed and who will not succeed can be understood early on without waiting for the final result.

Therefore, I can add a sentence: "Success in attempts lies in reason and justice."

### Bombing

— Li Qiao

——Memories of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou

Having suffered from fever rashes all night, shouldering a mortar shell, I followed the team through the dead city of Xuzhou and broke through the enemy's encirclement. In the slow-rising yellow and gray smoke, we kept walking urgently. The night slowly changed from dark gray to light gray, and all the villages, trees, and wheat seedlings that had been swallowed by darkness slowly and dimly appeared. Several sleepless stars in the sky weakly half-closed their eyes, and the morning breeze lightly slipped past the wheat tips. Attacked by sleep, but still weakly active like some kind of machine, the people seemed to have the clouds that covered their consciousness torn away, and suddenly woke up. The body that was about to collapse due to fatigue seemed to be supported by something, and felt firm. Only the two painful feet, blistered and blistering again, seemed to be tied to lead weights, making it impossible to drag them!

In the gray and vast sky, where the night had not completely faded, a plane suddenly appeared. Hearing the loud engine sound, the advancing team hurriedly scattered and lay down in the wheat field.

Lying comfortably in the wheat field, watching the plane, whether it was the enemy's or our own, draw an arc low in the dim sky and fly away, the scattered people and horses then merged into a torrent again, rolling forward.

The night had completely faded, and the sun, with a red face, slowly rose from the forest in the east. Intolerable hunger and thirst made many people fall behind. But the team in front didn't seem to care, and continued to advance.

Enemy planes, in twos and threes, kept soaring in the sky. Seeing some straggling brothers, scattered and walking in the fields, they didn't care at all until it flew over their heads, then they went to the wheat field and lay down. Looking at the golden light shining in the sun, which was only wasting gasoline, I couldn't help but whisper: "See what you can do?"

Harassed by enemy planes all the way, after suffering until after ten o'clock, we finally arrived at the encampment - Xu San Village.

This was a small village of about thirty or forty households, but almost all the people had fled. After finding an empty house that the comrades had chosen in advance, I ignored the yellow dust all over my body and rolled onto a bed in a room with two comrades to sleep.

My eyelids, which hadn't closed for two nights, had just closed and entered the sweet dreamland. I was awakened by a rough sound, the sound was so heavy and chaotic, it was clear that at least three heavy bombers had arrived overhead. But experience seemed to tell us: we can't run, so we calmly stayed lying down, covered with a gray blanket. The people in the house who were talking about something suddenly fell silent. Everyone's heart seemed to feel a kind of pressure, and the air in the house became very tense, as if some kind of unfortunate disaster was about to come. But we silently just waited, waited for the disaster to come!

The humming sound was getting closer and closer, more and more frightening, as if it was about to land on our roof, when suddenly a shocking and huge sound rang out:

——WHOOSH!

Like an earthquake, the house was shaking, and yellow dust fell from the walls and ceiling, flying upward again. The house was full of yellow dust, making it impossible to open our eyes, and the bomb fragments howled as they flew into the house, but splashed on the walls.

The people in the house, as if they had lost consciousness, were lost in the yellow dust, unable to breathe, when a series of shocking explosions rang out again:

——WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!…………

The house was shaking again as if having a fever, the bomb fragments were howling mournfully in the yellow dust, we covered our heads under the gray blanket, feeling a little numb in our mouths, and thought in our hearts: we are definitely going to die today!

But I don't know how, after more than half an hour of bombing, we were still alive. After the enemy plane dropped its bombs, it circled overhead for a while and flew away triumphantly. We ran out of the house, under the threat of death, and looked around: the enemy plane's bombs had dug several large holes in the threshing ground outside the house, and several empty houses made of sorghum stalks nearby had been shaken down by the bombs. But the house we were staying in was not damaged at all.……

"The ×× imperialists are really bored! Their bombs are probably free, you see, they bombed these things!"

"If the people in their country knew that their hard-earned money was being wasted on our land and branches, I wonder how painful they would feel!"

"It's not enough to just feel pain, they have to rise up and oppose it!"

The enemy plane flew back, so we hurriedly scattered and lay down under the shade of the trees on the riverbank, letting it bomb again!

Miserably, sparse groups of people, like ghosts, moved silently.

(In the distance, on the dark plains, sinister demons guard the night!)

Suddenly, a magnificent and stirring song burst forth from the long, broad wall enclosure there, interwoven with anger and valor.

A shadow crossed my heart:

I remembered that behind this wall were locked eight hundred dragons! They had a glorious and immortal history! Now, they possessed only soaring spirit, yet were deprived of freedom, burdened with shackles!

They hibernated in lonely days, and a fervent patriotism, along with accusations against the enemy, naturally erupted into song, broadcast into the night sky.

Oh, magnificent and stirring song! You trembled the darkness! You trembled the universe!

My heart pounded even more with the surging rhythm!

### The Art of Pushing

— Geng Zhi

"The frost on his roof," it's okay to "ignore," that's being smart. However, "the snow in front of your own door" still needs "to be swept," and that's actually hard work. So, not sweeping isn't good either, so what to do? Well, you can "push" it, push it onto someone else; if you don't know how to push, then you might as well learn.

There are many ways to push: For example, if there's a house across the way, you can openly and legitimately announce to them that this snow is in front of their door, and they should sweep it. If there isn't a house across the way, you can also righteously tell the neighbors on the left and right that this snow is near them, and they should sweep it. If there aren't any neighbors to the left or right, you can even more seriously tell the passersby that this snow is on the path they are walking on, and they should sweep it. If you can take it a step further and prove that the snow fell because of these people, then you're even more justified in asking them to sweep it, making them unable to refuse. If you can reach the final step, proving that the snow was either brought down by them or brought from somewhere else, then you can even more effortlessly tell them to sweep it clean, achieving great success. Even if they die from sweeping, they can only die without complaint.

This method, pushing it onto others, shifting the blame, the mistakes, all the bad luck, the losses, and the unfortunate things, onto others, while you, light and carefree, enjoy the fruits of their labor, how wonderful! Nowadays, many big shots with great careers, high positions, widespread reputations, abundant wealth, and strong influence, whether in politics, culture, business, or any field, have reached their current position largely because they have mastered the art of pushing.

When something comes into their hands, eyes, or minds, they never do it immediately. The first step is to see if it benefits them. If it doesn't, they push it. They spare no brainpower, effort, or energy to push this matter onto someone else, saying that it is not their responsibility. Even if it only takes a little brainpower, effort, or energy to accomplish, they are unwilling to do it; they still want to push it.

Of course, they weren't born knowing how to push; they learned it. Perhaps at first, they couldn't get things done without pushing, they couldn't "swallow more than they could chew." They learned from this lesson and, being ambitious to achieve success, they had no choice but to learn, to learn this pushing. Over time, it became a habit, and they used pushing in everything, and it always worked.

However, unexpected things always happen: What if there is snow in front of the door, covering the ground, but there isn't even a single person to push it onto? Is it really going to force His Majesty to personally sweep it? Well, you can still push it, push it onto a nonexistent person, Mr. Nobody, Mr. Emptiness. In other words, everything requires investment, and it's never worth it. Since no one can be blamed for this snow, it's okay to leave it there, ignore it, or pretend not to see it, letting it melt on its own or letting it freeze there. If you say the front door is inconvenient to walk through, you can always go around to the back door; if there's snow at the back door too, you can go through the side door, the transverse door, the side door, or the auxiliary door; there are many doors. You'd rather put more effort into going around than put less effort into sweeping, because sweeping means losing dignity, changing a consistent policy, and breaking the non-sweeping principle. Even if your shoes get wet and you slip, you still don't sweep, implementing your pushing.

This kind of pushing, applied to everything, is procrastination. Today you push it to tomorrow, and tomorrow you push it to tomorrow, and so on. If a bad thing turns into a small thing because of this pushing, and a small thing turns into nothing, then the pusher can congratulate himself on having foresight, thus avoiding disaster. If the pushing turns nothing into a small thing, a small thing into a big thing, and the big thing is also unfavorable, then you can always say that pushing is already like this, so what would it be like if you didn't push? Anyway, there are always reasons, and you can always push.

This kind of pushing cannot be achieved overnight; it also needs to be learned. Once learned, its mysteries are endless: it can keep you away from disaster and turn bad luck into good fortune; at the very least, even if there's no success, there's no failure either!

The first type of pushing is the "live" push that you can get rid of, and the second type is the "dead" push that you can't get rid of. Using both together, the art of pushing is practically complete.

Finally, we remember that there is also the push of "Confucius declined due to illness," which must also be learned. This means telling lies, fabricating stories, shirking responsibility, and deceiving people without paying for it. When poor friends come to see you, you must pretend you're not home; when you need to join the army, you must pretend to have disabilities; when you need to donate money, you must pretend to be poor; when you need to participate in patriotic movements, you must pretend you don't have time; when you have a prior appointment, you must pretend that there was no such thing; when bending over in a melon patch, you must pretend you're putting on your shoes; when reaching for plums under a tree, you must pretend you're adjusting your hat;... Once this push is learned, it becomes the culmination of the art of pushing, comparable to Confucius, the most sage in pushing!

However, it is common for there to be no one to push onto, or to push a cart into a wall, resulting in a broken head and bleeding, so it seems like some caution is needed.

### "Candy" and "Whip"

— Yin Sanlang

According to reports, fascist countries consistently use the "candy" and "whip" policy.

"Candy" and "whip" seem to be contradictory terms, but in reality, if we observe the current world situation and are not too forgetful, we will definitely feel that the so-called "candy" and "whip" are indeed very connected.

Opening the newspapers of the past six months, they are filled with many great deeds related to "candy" and "whip." Isn't that right? Small and weak countries in Eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, Albania, and Spain, have all suffered the pain of the "whip" under the temptation of "candy."

Fascist countries, relying on their weapons, are constantly trying to seize and plunder, gaining some advantages. But humanity has innate ingenuity and intelligence. Thus, if fascist aggressors are coveting something, the first step will never be to reveal their original hideous faces. They must steal the old trick of deceiving adults and children alike, using "candy" to lure it. Thus, first, the two sides sign some economic agreement or military agreement, so that a small and weak country, in a state of hesitation and consideration, feels very comfortable hearing it. Once the first step of the "candy" plan is successful, the original evil face is revealed step by step. By the time they realize they have been tricked, and want to change their course, it is too late. They have already tasted the most poisonous taste of the "whip."

Although the universe is vast, the principles are the same. Let us take a closer look at the fascist allies in the Far East. Are they not playing the same trick? Before the "July 7th" Incident, they always consistently offered us "candy" in the form of "Sino-Japanese friendship," "economic cooperation," and "coexistence and co-prosperity." At the time, we really felt like "refusing it would be disrespectful, accepting it would be painful."

Now, using the "whip" to intensify the beating, and revealing its true form today, it is still distributing those delicious "candies" in the occupied areas. What "establishing a new order in East Asia" and "reviving new China" are all despicable tricks to deceive adults and children. What is regrettable is that there are absolutely no complete fools in the world who will forever eat their "candy" without feeling the bitterness.

Now, those who have eaten their "candy" and tasted the "whip" have all understood and have also tightly raised the "righteous whip" in their hands to resist the "unreasonable whip" of the invaders. Moreover, I believe that in the near future, there will be a day when the "righteous whip" will shatter the "tyrannical whip!"

### Beware of Poisoned Apples

— Zhou Guangzuo

### Sketch of General Zhao Dong

— Zhou Yizhi

The young General Zhao Dong, he abandoned civil engineering and led guerrilla forces to resist the Japanese army. Therefore, his enemy has offered a reward of 100,000 yuan for his head, but he still carries it with him, traveling in danger. (Continued)

When the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident occurred in 1937, and the Japanese army wanted to give China a "fatal blow," General Zhao saw the opportunity he had been waiting for. He secretly transported the munitions he had previously collected very secretly to a Chinese university outside Beiping City. At the time, his sixty-three-year-old mother—who is now the nationally renowned "Mother of Chinese Guerrillas," Old Mrs. Zhao—and his young sister also participated in the matter. On July 22nd, they rose up to resist the Japanese army. There were only twenty-four people in total, and Zhao Dong was elected as their leader. At the end of July that year, Beiping fell, and hundreds of Chinese university students from Beiping withdrew into the mountains, where they expanded Zhao Dong's ranks. At that time, the value of Zhao Dong's head increased from 3,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan.

The brave soldiers led by General Zhao Dong were called the "North China People's Anti-Japanese Army." They assisted the Chinese regular army in fighting the Japanese army in North China, engaging in more than sixty battles, large and small. Their strategy, like that of guerrilla forces elsewhere in China, was to exchange minimal costs for greater victories, attacking small Japanese garrisons or Japanese transport teams. Recently, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers have died at their hands, and about two hundred and thirty military vehicles have been destroyed or captured by them.

The brave soldiers of General Zhao Dong often refer to the Japanese army's cargo trucks as "tax-paying porters." Now, many of them use Japanese rifles and wear Japanese army coats. Once, they intercepted a large quantity of Japanese canned food. That night, they held a grand banquet to celebrate the final victory of China.

Zhao Dong's monthly salary is only five yuan, but in the Japanese side's eyes, he is worth 100,000 yuan—six years ago, he was only worth 3,000 yuan. In August of last year, a spy hired by the Japanese army somehow infiltrated General Zhao's ranks. He was quickly discovered by his comrades. So he—this spy—confessed. It turned out that he had already received 5,000 yuan from the Japanese army, and after he successfully killed General Zhao to report his accomplishment, he could receive a check for 50,000 yuan. Naturally, he did not get the last check, and instead his life was lost.

Zhao Dong's subordinates are very loyal to their leader; they are all native peasants from the eight counties of Pingxi. Some of them were driven from their hometowns by the Japanese army, and most of their female relatives were systematically insulted by the invaders. Now, their main plan is to use propaganda and other political work to encourage and organize their compatriots.

What kind of damage have Zhao's troops inflicted on the Japanese army in southern Manchuria and the suburbs of Beiping? In Manchuria, in seven years, they killed more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers and captured 3,000 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. In North China, since July 22, 1937, they have killed more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers and captured 2,000 rifles, 50 machine guns, and a large amount of ammunition. These munitions and military supplies are now used to return the favor to their original owners.

Until January 1939, the Japanese army had sent "punitive expeditions" to "exterminate" General Zhao Dong's troops no less than six times. The most severe of these was in October of last year. The Japanese side mobilized three brigades, carrying heavy artillery, to attack Mao Feng Mountain (transliteration)—one of the peaks of the West Mountains—the guerrilla headquarters. In addition, eleven bombers dropped bombs over the mountain peak to aid in the battle. This battle lasted for two days and one night. When the Japanese army climbed the mountain peak, they discovered that the Chinese guerrilla forces had completely withdrawn, and had also taken everything with them when they withdrew. How frustrating and disappointing! They also inspected the bodies of Chinese guerrilla forces on the mountain and found only thirty-four; while they themselves had lost more than three hundred.

Humble, honest, and polite, General Zhao Dong gave visitors a very good impression in Chongqing. Whenever he talked to people, he always talked about: "Resisting Japan!" and "Guerrilla warfare!" His pair of long-lashed eyes, combined with black and thick eyebrows, shone powerfully. He is one of China's bravest fighters.

Soon, General Zhao will return to his brothers in Beiping. According to his current plan, when he returns to Pingxi, he will give the Japanese army a large-scale blow.

Life Report

### Guide Brokers

— Xiao Ying

Since the rapid rise of guide agencies like mushrooms after rain, guide brokers, which are associated with guide agencies, are also one of them. Especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, industry and commerce have declined, and the number of unemployed people has increased significantly. Driven by the need to make a living, the number of people taking this path is also increasing day by day.

Unfortunately, I am also one of those who have taken this path for a living, wasting time, and it has been three months already. Guide agencies in China are originally a disguised form of certain transactions, which is a public fact. What kind of work is a guide broker? Readers can easily explore and find out. Such a humble profession that is meaningless to the social public, how ashamed and worthless I feel when I hold my pen to write these words!

The working hours of a guide broker are generally after six or seven o'clock in the afternoon, when the lights come on and activity gradually begins. Hotels and restaurants are the best destinations. Every larger tavern and inn has our footprints. The tools of the trade are a photo album of guide girls and some promotional advertisements for guide agencies. Otherwise, like brokers in other professions, we rely on eloquent tongues to solicit customers and earn meager profits. Working hours usually last until at least midnight. Some extend their working hours even longer to increase their income slightly. Such all-night leg pain, eye strain, and lip fatigue, if you're lucky, you might earn close to a yuan, but sometimes, if the timing is bad, "eating tangyuan" is also common. Life is also pitiful and distressing. Since the Public Works Department banned guide brokers, major hotels have also followed suit in banning them from entering, which is an even more fatal blow to guide brokers.

Because guide agencies are dens of decadence, and guide brokers usually don't have much to do during the day, the temptation of the environment often makes it difficult to avoid going with the flow. The money earned so hard is either gambled away or used to lavishly spend time and play with guide girls. It may be excusable to live this humble life temporarily driven by economic forces, but to be trapped in the pit of depravity and not know how to extricate oneself is even more sinful. Those who are currently engaged in this profession should be aware of this!

### After the Rain, Clear Skies

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality, Acting on Stage; Should One Proceed or Stop, Making a Home Anywhere

In addition to this automobile manufacturing company, Mrs. Suria also had a family car rental company, which was a unique idea. It involved creating a car that was perfectly suited for family use and renting it out for travel. This venture also succeeded as a joke. Originally, when Mrs. Suria first came to Shanghai, Jin Danyu was also the one who entertained her. Jin Danyu drove her around everywhere, taking her to various places to play. Mrs. Suria didn't like riding in small cars, but preferred spacious cars because she was plump and double-sized. When Yu Danyu accompanied her on outings, she often fell asleep in the car on warm and sunny days. Jin Danyu laughed and said, "A car that you can sit, lie down, read, and write in would be really convenient." Mrs. Suria said, "We have many of those kinds of cars in America; they're called 'mobile homes.' Many engineers, as they please, have manufactured those kinds of cars. I've seen a few myself, but some are suitable for winter but not for summer, and some are suitable for summer but not for winter. Some are suitable for waterside forests, and some are suitable for mountain villages with ancient temples. They design them according to their own preferences, just to use them for travel, so there are bound to be some shortcomings. I have a friend who once brought one to China, and he said that this kind of 'mobile home' is most suitable for China because China is a large place, especially with many scenic spots. In recent years, highways have been opened everywhere, and that kind of car, like a small family, can be driven anywhere. I said that kind of car can not only be used for sightseeing, but can also be needed for all kinds of construction and academic work, and will definitely be popular in the future." Jin Danyu said, "Why would that kind of car be needed for construction and academic work?" Mrs. Suria said, "For example, if there are many projects in deep mountains and remote valleys, the supervisors and designers have to follow their projects. Today they are here, and tomorrow they are there; they cannot have a fixed place to live. In the past, those who handled projects would build crude houses on the spot, which would be demolished after the project was completed. But it always felt fixed and clumsy. With that kind of mobile home, as long as there is a road, they can drive here today and drive there tomorrow, wouldn't that be convenient? As for those who study academic subjects, there are now many subjects that cannot be invented by closing themselves in a small room and thinking deeply. They must explore and pursue in various places, even to places where people rarely tread. As your Chinese say, 'Building a hut in an uninhabited place,' you can't say that kind of car is not beneficial to learning." (95)

### New Talk on the Opera Scene

— She Weng

The play "Si Lang Visits His Mother" has been popular for a long time and is a must-learn for amateur performers, so it has value for research. However, there are two styles for Si Lang's acceptance of the princess's command flag: one is to hide the flag behind the waist, which is the old way, as Lao Tan did. The other is to insert it next to the neck, just to make the style look good. Fu Ying did not follow the old style, but improved it for his grandfather.

Mao Shilai gained fame in the north and south for performing shrewish plays in his childhood. Although he has not yet reached the most seasoned stage, he is already regarded as Little Cuihua. I believe that the broader scope of Dan roles is in the boudoir style. If he inclines towards the shrewish aspect, it will inevitably affect the development of other aspects. I alone expect him to be Little Xun Huisheng for this reason.

Yesterday I watched Zhang Eyun perform Xun Huisheng's play "Wood Hairpin and Phoenix Ming." The singing was quite good, and there were places where the tune was easily changed. The expression was insufficient, even if you don't compare it with Liu Xiang, it seems that his spirit was not concentrated. It is very difficult to perform other people's scripts, and the saying that the script must match the personality of the performer is even more credible.

Friends all praise Yan Shishan's appearance and martial arts as beautiful. Yesterday I just got to see his "Tide Gold Top," and it was indeed excellent. I heard that he can also do Dao Ma Hua Dan types of plays. He is a versatile talent among the rising stars, which is rare and valuable. His age is in the golden age, and the theaters should regard him as a golden figure and let him display his talents more, not bury a hero in a useful place, which is also what the art appreciators sympathize with.

### Behind the Scenes of the "Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting Through the Ages"

— Xu Bangda

The initial initiators of the "Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting Through the Ages" were Mr. Ding Huikang, Wu Hufan, and Liu Haisu. Everyone probably already knows their intentions and purposes. Regarding the exhibits, collection, and display, I would like to announce to the gentlemen who have enthusiastically supported and actively visited. In addition to me, Mr. Pan Chuanshan is also responsible for the display work. Mr. Pan is a scholar who is well-versed in art and literature, and is also a collector and calligrapher and painter. Therefore, the layout of this venue really benefited greatly from Mr. Pan's contributions. In addition, Sun Boyuan, Cao Youqing, Xiang Shude, and the brothers Wu Binchen and Bicheng were all running around together. I was just following and assisting. The request for exhibits this time was made by several standing committee members of the association separately contacting their friends, and there was no public solicitation. Who knew that the result after collection was beyond expectations, with a total of more than four hundred pieces. It can be seen how enthusiastically the collectors supported us, which is really very grateful. However, the venue is always too small and cannot be displayed all at once, which is unavoidable.

The first display consisted of one hundred and thirty-three pieces and was exhibited for five days. When it was changed for the second time, because there were relatively fewer precious paintings from the Yuan Dynasty, several were retained. Among the Ming and Qing Dynasties, except for a few very important pieces that were not repeated among the exhibits, only a few could be left, and more than nine out of ten were replaced with new ones. This added nearly a hundred more pieces; however, there were still more than one hundred pieces left. Originally, we wanted to only change it once, but it seems that it can't be done this way. So, at the dinner of the standing committee on the 19th, it was publicly agreed to change everything again on the 23rd. This way, we can finally see all the exhibits received. However, because the days are too tight, we can only display it for two days, which is very regrettable.

As for the order of hanging, it is entirely based on the needs and capacity of the venue. The first, second, and third times were completely without prejudice, with the goal of hanging everything.

We believe that the preservation of the exhibits this time is very thorough. In the venue, the hanging paintings are separated by wooden railings; the scrolls are covered with glass cabinets, so they will certainly not be damaged or soiled. Even when they are taken down, each painting is wiped and then wrapped in kraft paper. Fortunately, the helpful Mr. Sun and Mr. Cao are all experts in calligraphy and painting, and are very skilled at rolling and unrolling them, so there is no risk of bending or creasing them. This can be a comfort to all the exhibitors.

Finally, we must state one very important thing, that is, the exhibits displayed this time are hung as long as they arrive, without any selection. The authenticity, beauty, and ugliness of them are to be distinguished and judged by the visiting gentlemen themselves. Because Mr. Pan and I only have the responsibility of displaying, not the authority of reviewing. If it is said that there are many good ones, that is the best. Or if it is said that they are not very satisfactory, then the one yuan ticket can be considered a donation to relieve the refugees. Gentlemen, you can probably forgive us.

### An Overview of the Erhu (Part 2)

— Ni Qiuping

Regarding Performance Techniques

The erhu's sound can be quite brash, but when used well, it can produce stirring tones. However, beginners can make it sound headache-inducing, and without three to five years of hard work, don't expect to produce pleasant sounds. (It's not like the VIOLIN, which has a beautiful inherent sound.) This is the first major hurdle. Moreover, there are many variations in technique. Regarding the right hand's pulling and releasing, one must differentiate well. Half bow, full bow, bow root, bow tip—each produces different results. The inner and outer strings should be relaxed and active. There are short strokes and tremolo bowing. (Similar to the flying staccato of the VIOLIN.) One must also push outwards and bring inwards, without any hint of roughness. These few points are already quite demanding. Regarding the left hand, this is about fingering. First, pressing should be neither too light nor too heavy, and at the same time, it should be determined by the weight of the bow. The fingers should be able to move up and down—first light, then heavy, first heavy, then light. Sometimes, the string is tapped lightly, and there is also the so-called vibrato, which is quite similar to the TRILL in Western music. However, it's used very often on the erhu, sometimes pronounced, sometimes subtle. The most troublesome part is in places where it shouldn't be added, people insist on adding it, causing endless suffering. All of the above are necessary conditions for perfect artistry. Even so, not everyone can achieve it. If one uses the lower position, it becomes even more troublesome. Without exquisite technique, sensitive hearing (i.e., auditory perception), and a calm demeanor, one cannot achieve satisfactory results. When starting to practice, it's best to adopt Sun Zuochen's methods because his are simpler; with a few months of effort, one can manage. The erhu rests on the lap and is too light, so when using the lower position, it's prone to instability. Therefore, when practicing the lower position, one must first stabilize it, or else it cannot be performed. Furthermore, there is the familiarity with the stage. Every play has a specific sequence, and one should have ample memorization beforehand; otherwise, one will freeze on stage, which insiders call a "black stage." Once familiar with the stage, then the speed and rhythm become a major issue. At the same time, one must harmonize with the singer and the stage. One cannot act solely according to one's subjective ideas, as that will lead to failure. As for the most important thing, one must be familiar with the melodies. Each role type—sheng, dan, jing, lai—has its own characteristics. Furthermore, even with the same old sheng role, the plays differ. Even if the plays are the same, the singing styles are different. These are all realms that those learning the erhu must pass through. One must be broad and proficient, and never harbor careless thoughts. One must strive for better within good to achieve excellence. To seek excellence within excellence is to achieve transformation. Often, some people look down on the erhu. I dare say they definitely cannot play it, and if they can, it's only in a very amateurish way. Naive people, of course, speak with blind criticism. If everyone had this mindset, then art would not be able to progress. The erhu's timbre is truly excellent; such a small instrument produces such a grand sound. However, the range of tones is too limited. If someone were to devote themselves to in-depth research, then naturally, there would be many more variations that could be created. If, because of its simplicity, one doesn't research it and claims without basis that the erhu has no value, then it's because one's own thinking is too simple. Consider the piano and violin in Western music today; they also reached their current status through the efforts of many people. If no one had improved them in the beginning, then wouldn't they still be mere musical toys?

### Biographies of Figures in Small Theaters (Part 1)

— Man Fu

Foreword

The Shanghai theatrical scene is trending towards "retro," as evidenced by the Golden, Carlton, and Cardo theaters' exclusive performances of old plays. Originally, Shanghai's theaters were called teahouses. Now, the upper floors of several teahouses are staging plays at night again. Due to the regulations of the Municipal Council, before the main play begins, a few "people from the singing profession" give a brief performance, awaiting the main play's entrance, euphemistically called "dress rehearsal." This has long restored the old look of the "teahouse" from thirty years ago, but now that everything emphasizes modernity, teahouses are called "small theaters." Looking around the "small theaters" of Shanghai, there are only three: "Xiao Guanghan," "Changle," and "Shidai." The highest ticket price is uniformly 3 jiao. I listen to songs every night, and based on what I have seen and heard, I am writing "Biographies of Figures in Small Theaters," but those who have left are not included.

The Xiao Guanghan Section

Xiao Guanghan is the first "small theater" in Shanghai. Because of its profitable business, Changle and Shidai followed. Almost all the actors at Changle and Shidai came from Xiao Guanghan. I will first describe Xiao Guanghan.

Jiang Xiaolou and Wang Xiaofeng are both female performers who play old men's roles, excelling in both singing and acting. They have similar performance styles. The theater spares no expense, actually using double the star power. Jiang was a leading actor in both the Two Celebrities and Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou water route troupes, and is skilled in small-scale plays, such as "Life and Death Plank," "Prosperous Spring and Autumn," "A Blow of Snow," "The Legend of Chu-Han Heroes," etc., which are rare among female singers who play male roles.

Liu Qinxin, a disciple of Liu Yuqin, is known for her female roles, such as "Battle of Wancheng," "Mount Cuiping," "Pan Jinlian." Her performances are meticulous. All were personally taught by Liu Yuqin. Qinxin is the goddaughter of Mr. Xu Muyun, author of this newspaper's "Secrets of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital."

Xiao Wang Huchen is a female performer who plays male martial roles. She is the niece of the veteran actor Fan Chunlou and the beloved daughter of Fan Chunshan. She studied acting under Wang Huchen, hence her name. She has a handsome appearance, and her martial arts performances are fiery, making her a rising star among female martial artists.

Zhou Biyun came from Zhu Dongmei's Fengyi Kun troupe. She initially learned acting from Wang Ziyu, and later belonged to Yong'an Tianyunlou, playing female roles. She is known for her flirtatious roles. "Drum Dance" and "Changing Fortune Society" are quite watchable. Her appearance is very beautiful, and her craftsmanship is meticulous. It's a pity her singing is not clean, and her dialogue is more fluent and pleasing to the ear.

Wu Guifen is the backstage manager. When a performer is missing on stage, the backstage manager fills in. Wu was originally a famous actor, on par with Xiao Dazi. She sings any kind of play, and is a longtime figure at Xiao Guanghan.

Su Yunqiu, Wu Guifen's daughter, is better at Qingyi roles than Hua Dan roles. Still unmarried, the reason for her surname Su is unknown. Her voice and acting are good, but unfortunately, she is not good at makeup, so she has not become popular. She is the same Wu Cuiyun who received high praise at the Divine World Xianshi Amusement Park more than ten years ago.

Zhao You'an is a male performer who does both Jing and Chou roles. He is corpulent and has mediocre expressions. He should put in more effort.

Since its inception, this publication has daily published Mr. Xu Muyun's "Secrets of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital." We are grateful for the praise from our esteemed readers. The author and the editors consider themselves extremely fortunate! In response to the demands of the majority of our readers, we plan to publish it as a standalone book. We are currently in the process of organizing, adding, and deleting as appropriate. Once ready, we will announce the pre-order. In the future, we will still ask Mr. Muyun to write "Pear Garden Anecdotes," about the forgotten stories and anecdotes in the Pear Garden, regardless of north or south, past or present; anything with value for commentary will be collected as much as possible. Mr. Xu is familiar with the lore of the Pear Garden and writes with a lively pen. It can be predicted that he will be supported by readers. "Pear Garden Anecdotes" will begin publication on May 1st. We hope our readers will pay attention.

### Earthquake in Nanjing

(See this Newspaper from April of the 11th Year of Tongzhi of the Defunct Qing Dynasty)

The other day, a friend spoke of an earthquake in Nanjing, which I suspected was a rumor and did not believe. Today, someone came from Nanjing, and I hastily inquired. I learned that there was indeed an earthquake around dusk the other day, lasting about the time it takes to eat a meal. Houses nearly collapsed, and on boats, teacups tilted, with some breaking. It is said that from Zhenjiang to Wuhu, for hundreds of miles up and down, there were earthquakes at the same time, but Suzhou and Songjiang did not feel it. Those who say that earthquakes are caused by disharmony in the earth's energy, and are unrelated to fortune or calamity.

### Coiled Dragon on the Water

The other night, at half past nine, a Westerner was walking across the bridge and saw a large crowd of people leaning against the bridge posts and looking down, as if waiting for something. The Westerner did not understand what was happening and asked an old man by tugging on his sleeve. The old man said, "A divine dragon has appeared under the bridge! Its body is like a giant snake, coiled and motionless, probably waiting for the assistance of wind and thunder." At this time, the moonlight was bright, and the waves were clear. The Westerner looked but saw nothing, probably because his shoulders and back were crowded and blocked his view. Just as he was wondering, another Chinese person came, knowing the situation, and also wanted to get to the bottom of it. So they hired a small sampan boat and together rowed it under the bridge. From afar, they saw a dark shadow, but could not tell the head from the tail, nor whether it was a snake or a dragon. They insisted on seeing it up close and took a long boat pole, attaching a sharp blade to it, and stabbed it from the side. People on the bridge saw this and shouted loudly, thinking it was an offense to the divine dragon and absolutely unacceptable. They did not listen, and with a swing of their arm, the blade pierced it, and there was no sound. The object remained motionless. The people on the bridge shouted and clamored even louder, thinking that if it wagged its tail and stirred the waves, they would all be doomed. Afterwards, they slowly moved the boat to its side, used the pole to lift it up and examine it. It turned out to be a rotten bamboo basket, wrapped in a bamboo mat, and there was a broken giant rice stalk nearby, floating in the water, joined together. Seen from afar in the moonlight, it looked like a coiled dragon. Once they had examined it and saw the truth, the people on the bridge all laughed heartily, mocking their own misjudgment.
