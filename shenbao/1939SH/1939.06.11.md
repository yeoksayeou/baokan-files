### Fierce Battles in Southwestern Shanxi: Chinese Troops Firmly Defend Key Strongholds, Repeatedly Inflicting Heavy Blows, Japanese Attempts to Cross the River Extremely Difficult to Succeed, Large Chinese Forces Gather on the Opposite Bank of Jun Ferry, Awaiting in Battle Formation

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese troops are currently advancing towards three important Yellow River crossings in three directions. Fierce fighting is taking place in western Shanxi. The main force of the Japanese army is currently attacking Jun Ferry, apparently intending to cross the river and invade Shaanxi. However, well-informed Chinese military figures here expressed doubt as to whether the Japanese truly intend to advance on Xi'an, believing that the Japanese troops in Shanxi Province must remain stationed there due to the activities of the Chinese army in various parts of the province. The Japanese army would need to transfer a large force into Shanxi before they could attack Shaanxi Province. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Hong Kong) Yuanqu dispatch: The battle in southwestern Shanxi is still fierce. Up until the 9th, the fighting was raging near Liulin and Qikou. All key strongholds are in Chinese hands. Japanese casualties are greater than those of the Chinese army. In Fan-Pinglu, the Japanese army has been killed by the Chinese army in the past three days with four to five hundred men. Although the Japanese army is reinforcing Ji Fan everywhere, judging from the strength, their attempt will be extremely difficult to succeed (Special dispatch, 10th)

(Chongqing) According to sources here today, the Japanese troops who advanced to Qikou, Jun Ferry, and Sanjiao in western Shanxi have been defeated by the Chinese army except for those at Jun Ferry. The Japanese side is now withdrawing troops from both Hebei and Henan to the Jun Ferry line in order to cross the river. However, on the opposite bank of Jun Ferry, (i.e., the Shaanxi side), the Chinese side has gathered a large army, awaiting in battle formation. The Japanese army's attempt to cross the river will definitely not succeed. According to reports, the Japanese army originally advanced westward from Lishi and Zhongyang in three directions. The central route led to Jun Ferry, the northern route to Qikou, and the southern route to Sanjiao. However, the Japanese troops on the northern route were intercepted by the Chinese regular army ten miles east of Qikou. After twenty-four hours of head-on attacks, the Japanese army suffered more than six hundred casualties, and their main force retreated towards Lishi, while the remaining troops retreated towards the southeast, hoping to join up with the central route. The Japanese army's offensive on the southern route has also failed. The Japanese troops on this route were repelled by the Chinese army twelve miles south of Liulin, and their main force retreated towards Zhongyang, while the remaining troops retreated towards the northeast, hoping to join up with the central route. The number of Japanese troops on the central route has now reached seven thousand. In southern Shanxi, Pinglu on the north bank of the Yellow River has fallen again after a fierce attack by eight thousand Japanese soldiers. However, Japanese casualties reached two thousand, showing the extent of their sacrifice. At the same time, the Chinese guerrillas have recaptured Maojin Ferry, five miles northeast of Pinglu. In this battle, four hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

Yuanqu: After the Japanese army captured Pinglu, they continued eastward. On the 9th, some Japanese troops sneaked into Pannan Village (west of Maojin) and built fortifications, attempting to join forces with the Japanese troops who had sneaked south of Zhangdian to attack Maojin Ferry. A certain unit of the Chinese army intercepted them head-on and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The two strongholds of Shengrenjian and Hanyao Village, directly north of Maojin, are still in Chinese hands. At noon on the 9th, two or three hundred Japanese soldiers from Dachen Village once invaded, but were repelled by the Chinese army. A certain unit of the Chinese army moved to the rear of the Japanese army, and thoroughly scoured the area of Xiaguocun, Nanbeilucun (east of Lingjiao Village). On the 10th, more than thirteen hundred Japanese soldiers were surrounded and routed by the Chinese army in Bu'ansao (near Lingjiao), killing many Japanese soldiers and capturing a large number of military supplies. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Chongqing) According to a report from Shanxi received here, the Japanese troops invading from Lishi have been blocked by the Chinese army and are at a standstill. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)

(Luoyang) On the morning of the 10th, the Chinese artillery in Shaanxi County fired more than a hundred shells across the river towards Pinglu, many of which landed in Japanese positions, causing heavy damage. The Japanese army counterattacked once from 4:00 to 6:00, with shells falling on Huixing Town and the banks of the Shaanxi Prefecture River, including many gas shells. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Xi'an) Military news: On the 4th, more than three hundred Japanese soldiers from Mancheng invaded Shimen and fought with the Chinese army for about two hours. Eventually, due to the disparity in numbers, Shimen was captured by the Japanese army. At 2:00 in the afternoon, the main force of the Chinese army arrived and launched a counterattack on the Japanese army. The Japanese army was unable to withstand it and fled towards Mancheng. In this battle, more than thirty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. (Dispatch, 9th) Yu Ji On the afternoon of the 5th, the Japanese army invaded Liulin. On the morning of the 6th, a part of five or six hundred sneaked to Jun Ferry, confronting the Chinese army across the river. The main force of the Japanese army is concentrated in Liulin and is rushing to repair the highway, and will continue to sneak west. China has completed the encirclement of Liulin. (Dispatch, 9th)

### Japanese Troops Retreating Towards Xinyang, Under Encirclement and Annihilation

Xiangyang: Several hundred Japanese soldiers who fled from Xinyang and invaded Wujiadian, with four cannons, shelled Wujiadian village on the 4th. On the 5th, four or five hundred infantry and cavalry, with eight cannons, came from Xinyang to reinforce and fiercely attacked Fengjiadian. After an attack by the Chinese army, many were wounded or killed. The Japanese army was unable to withstand it and fled towards Xinyang. The rest have been surrounded and are being annihilated by the Chinese. (Dispatch, 10th)

### Chinese Army Recovers Liyang

Tunxi: A certain unit of the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu launched a fierce attack on the county seat of Liyang at dawn on the 3rd. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted from the city. The Chinese plainclothes team in the city took the opportunity to respond, attacking from both inside and outside. The Japanese army immediately fled towards the west of the city and were ambushed by the Chinese army along the way, suffering heavy losses. The county seat was immediately recovered. In this battle, many Japanese supplies were captured. (Dispatch, 10th)

### Japanese Troops Invade Sanjiang and Muzhou, All Repelled

(Hong Kong) More than three hundred Japanese soldiers in Guangdong, using four shallow-water ships and more than twenty rubber boats, launched an attack from both the sea and land yesterday morning, shelling the Sanjiang and Muzhou areas. They then landed in the 8th and 16th districts, but were repelled by the Chinese local troops, with dozens of Japanese soldiers killed. Subsequently, Japanese warships attacked again, and the fighting was fierce. One Japanese warship was sunk by the Chinese side. (Special dispatch, 10th)

### Chongqing Public Opinion Supports the Arrest of Wang Jingwei

(Chongqing) Regarding the Supreme National Defense Council's decision to arrest Wang Jingwei in response to domestic and foreign demands, public opinion here is extremely welcoming, saying that it will enhance the determination to resist Japan. This measure has been generally expected since Jingwei left Chongqing, and has in fact been under consideration by the government at any time. Chongqing delayed issuing the order because it hoped that Wang could realize his mistakes and return to Chongqing. It was not until the news that Wang had decided to go to Tokyo for the second time on June 2 was confirmed that it was believed that he was incorrigible and had no choice but to issue an arrest warrant. Various newspapers pointed out that once Wang left Chongqing, his prestige plummeted, so his activities had no impact on the continued resistance of free China. It is believed that the government will also issue an arrest warrant for Zhou Fohai, who went to Japan. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### Chaozhou and Shantou Defenses Consolidated

Chao'an: A reporter from the Central News Agency recently traveled along the destroyed railway, on foot to a certain place to inspect Chaozhou and Shantou. Along the way, I witnessed women, children, the old and the weak evacuating from Shantou. Soldiers and civilians assisted in building fortifications, the situation was very busy. Everything was filled with a wartime atmosphere. After arriving in Chaozhou, I visited the military and political chiefs. I inquired about the defense forces of Chaozhou and Shantou. Commander □, with a firm tone, expressed his determination to defend Chaozhou and Shantou to the death, saying that the defensive arrangements had been completed, and the connection between the military and the people was very strong. The Japanese navy and air force's unusual movements in Linghai these days are a test of their attempt to invade. We have been very vigilant. If the Japanese come to invade, we will give them a head-on blow. (Dispatch, 8th)

### American Ambassador Leaves Yunnan for Chongqing

(Chongqing) The United States Ambassador to China, Johnson, and his entourage, Major McHer (Naval Counselor), came here by car today. They attended a banquet of the Diplomatic Association of Yunnan University in Kunming. It is also heard that French Ambassador Cosme is scheduled to go to Kunming from Haiphong on Wednesday, and will stay in Kunming for three or four days before coming to Chongqing.

### Suspect in the Assassination of Cheng Xigeng: The Tianjin British Concession Decides to Extradite, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Orders Guo Taiqi to Lodge a Serious Protest with Britain

(Chongqing) It has recently been rumored that the authorities of the British Concession in Tianjin, at the request of the Japanese side, have transferred Chinese citizens within the concession to the Japanese puppets, which has aroused much attention from all parties. The reporter inquired with the diplomatic authorities about the situation. It is said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the safety of the Chinese people in the British Concession in Tianjin, has repeatedly lodged solemn protests with the British side to properly safeguard them. It was previously reported that among the Chinese citizens detained in the concession, two will be transferred by the concession authorities to the Japanese side or puppet organization, and repeated representations have been made to the British Embassy, and Ambassador Guo has also been ordered to consult with the British government to seriously consider and order a halt. Recently, it was reported again that the British Concession authorities in Tianjin had received an ultimatum from the Japanese side, demanding that the four people deemed by the Japanese side to be related to the assassination of Cheng Xigeng be handed over within a time limit. The British government has decided to telegraph the concession authorities to extradite the aforementioned two people. Our side has again and again telegraphed the British Embassy to order Ambassador Guo to lodge a serious protest with the British government, explaining that our side attaches great importance to this matter and strongly requesting that the Japanese request be rejected. (Dispatch, 10th)

### Constantly Attacked by the Chinese Army, Most of the Japanese Troops in Qianjiang Retreat Outside the City, Chinese and Japanese Troops Face Each Other Across the River on the Hanyi Road Front, Intermittent Artillery Battles

Fancheng: Due to the constant attacks by the Chinese army, most of the Japanese troops in Qianjiang have withdrawn outside the city and are deployed on the east bank of the Dongjing River. Civilian houses have been opened up by the Japanese army, and Chinese people are not allowed to enter. A small number of Japanese cavalry are active near Qianjiang from time to time. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Yichang) The war in central Hubei has gradually subsided. Currently, there are only artillery battles in the Luohan Temple and Qianjiang areas on the Hanyi Road front, with Chinese and Japanese troops facing each other across the river. (Dispatch, 10th)

Xiushui: The Japanese troops in Wuning have increased slightly, and have been transferred from the Jinkou area. Chinese and Japanese troops are still facing each other in the Qian battlefield of Tupiyao Qiuchang, ten miles west of Wuning. From the 4th to the 9th, although the Japanese army continued to shell the Chinese side and sent small units to make probing disturbances, they were all repelled by the Chinese army. The line is currently very stable. (Dispatch, 10th)

Fancheng: After the Japanese army collapsed on the border between Henan and Hubei, the reporter went to the area to inspect. However, because all the highways were destroyed, and the civilian donkeys and horses were looted by the Japanese army, they went on foot, arriving only after two weeks. Wherever the Japanese iron hoof went, all suffered great disasters. The people in the border area of Henan and Hubei resolutely assisted the army in combat. The people brought their own dry food, destroyed highways, and transported bullets. What is most moving is that the people competed to adopt wounded soldiers. An old, lonely woman in Nanxiang, Xinyiye, whose arm was chopped off by the Japanese army, also insisted on adopting wounded soldiers. When asked, she said that it doesn't matter if I am injured in my hometown, but how can I not adopt soldiers who are injured in a foreign land for the country? Xu Buchen, the magistrate of Xinyiye County, personally led the self-defense team to resist when the Japanese army invaded, blocking the Japanese army's advance. Two days later, he finally enabled the Chinese army to arrive and eliminate the Japanese army. This is also commendable. The general public is able to thoroughly implement the national public, such as the people of Xinyiye not leading the way for the Japanese army, not finding food for the Japanese army, which is almost a universal phenomenon. After the Japanese army entered, it was like stepping into a jungle of thorns, unable to extricate themselves. The order in the recovered counties has been restored. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has ordered the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to allocate 10,000 yuan to relieve the disaster-stricken compatriots in Zaoyang. Other counties have also distributed stored grain and taken emergency relief measures, so the local situation is gradually improving. (Dispatch, 9th)

### Cooper Has Been Released

(Beiping) Cooper, the interpreter of the British Embassy, ​​who was ordered to go to Zhangjiakou from Beiping to investigate the case of British military officer Spears being detained by the Japanese side, was also detained by the Japanese side after arriving in Zhangjiakou. It is now known that Cooper has been released and will arrive in Beiping tonight. However, when Spears can be released is currently unknown. The British authorities are currently working hard to rescue him. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Editorial

### A Review of Shanghai Education at the Present Stage

Education is definitely not an unimportant issue. The other day was just when schools were about to have summer vacation, that is, when the academic year was about to start anew. The education community must be planning adjustment and progress work. It is very necessary for us to review education issues at this time. However, the scope of education is very broad. The current review is limited to the various problems of Shanghai education at the present stage.

It has been almost two years since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, that is, it has been nineteen months since the fall of Shanghai. In these nineteen months, although the government's leading role has been temporarily difficult to feel, the national consciousness and national concepts of the citizens are still very strong. What is the Great Wall of will of these five million citizens built on? Undoubtedly, the uninterrupted education work is the most important foundation. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the invaders have spared no effort to destroy cultural institutions wherever they go; however, when they need to cover up the progress of the world's eyes, they do not hesitate to use various means to deceive young people and use the puppet organization to promote their so-called puppet education. When Shanghai first fell, the education community painstakingly maintained the education business, so that the general youth and children in Shanghai would not lose their studies, which was like lighting a torch in the dark world. When the traffic between the occupied areas and Shanghai gradually increased, people from various places flocked to Shanghai. The schools in Shanghai fully absorbed the youth and children who came to Shanghai, allowing them to escape the dangerous situation of being good people educated, and still received the national education of the Republic of China. Due to these two facts, it can be seen how painstakingly the Shanghai education community has supported and dealt with the precarious situation in the past nineteen months. Their hard work for the country and the nation is really impossible to obliterate. We should pay our respects and sympathy to them.

In the past two years, the Shanghai education community has not only revealed the phenomenon of painstaking support in fact, but also repeatedly unfolded a positive struggle posture in the midst of crisis and shock in spirit. In the spring of last year, the puppet organization attempted to seize Shanghai education without success; now it has aroused the coveting of the Jingwei faction. Originally, among Jingwei's party members, there were many people who had a source with the education community, so society repeatedly raised the rumor that the faction bought the education community, and said it with color and sound, as if it were true; however, until today, the rumor is still a rumor, and fortunately no such facts have been found in the Shanghai education community. Therefore, our understanding of the Shanghai education community is generally that they are able to distinguish right from wrong, are not threatened, keep to the right path, and are upright, and we also feel infinite admiration.

However, we do not have to deny that Shanghai education has not been very sound in the past two years. There is more than one unsound example, and there are two points in summary: one is that the development of quantity is too much to the fullness of quality; the second is that the phenomenon of messy disharmony covers up the spirit of cooperation and solidarity.

The so-called quantitative development is manifested in two aspects: one is the increase in the number of schools, and the other is the sharp increase in the number of students per school. This is a very common fact and does not need to be listed statistics to know. Quantitative development does have its own social reasons, and it is not a bad phenomenon in itself: however, if the fullness of quality cannot cooperate with it, it is the so-called deformed development. Let us try to review, the equipment of each school in Shanghai is now mostly very shabby, and at the same time the treatment of teachers is much worse than before the war, so the school content spirit is difficult to be full. Although it is said that many schools are currently burdened by rent, we know that there are also many schools that are not burdened by rent, but they have not paid attention to the fullness of quality. Even if they are really burdened by rent, they may not be able to save unnecessary consumption and plan for the basic fullness of school equipment and other aspects.

The so-called phenomenon of messy disharmony can be analyzed into the following aspects: First, the management of schools over students between schools and students is very lax, lacking active unified guidance, and students have good organizational motivations, but schools cannot actively lead; when students have bad tendencies, schools cannot make rational sanctions. Second, the atmosphere of infighting and mutual accusation among school faculty and staff has been repeatedly discovered; the facts of the windstorm caused by it have also been repeatedly heard. Third, the methods between schools are different from each other, the signs are different, and jealousy and attack are inevitable, especially when they are on vacation and recruit students, they are very obvious. Fourth, although schools have fulfilled the responsibility of guiding the national consciousness of the people in Shanghai, in fact, the leading role of schools in society is not enough. For example, schools have failed to play the function of the front line in the correction of bad customs, the unfolding of relief movements, and the implementation of spiritual mobilization. Fifth, schools have failed to fully comply with the national curriculum standards, and the tutor system has not been universally implemented, which shows that the Shanghai education community has not fully complied with the government's commandments and faithfully carried out the tasks of national education.

The two unhealthy points mentioned above are really the universal shortcomings of modern education, that is, capitalist education. However, in the past, there were government agencies to supervise and guide, so there were few opportunities for exposure; now, because the government has failed to obtain sufficient leadership, this shortcoming has been fully exposed. Education and politics originally have an inseparable relationship, so the crux of the shortcomings of Shanghai education at the present stage is still due to political reasons. However, we are now trying to develop the spirit of autonomy and national spirit of the Shanghai education community and even the citizens, and correct all the shortcomings. Even if the government does not have sufficient leadership in form, it will never reveal the state of anarchy in fact.

In October last year, the editorial of this newspaper pointed out that in order to correct the shortcomings of Shanghai education at present: first, the schools should organize joint institutions, and use the collective strength to act as the government's leading role; second, build a sound social public opinion, as an effective supervision and guidance. Although several months have passed now. We feel that these two methods should still be applied; however, at the beginning of this academic year. Each school should review itself individually, strive individually, and serve as the foundation of the joint organization.

To reiterate, although the Shanghai education community is currently showing that it is not threatened by power, not lured by profit, and does not succumb to evil forces: however, the other party's offensive will inevitably intensify in the future; the hardship of the work of the Shanghai education community will inevitably deepen. Therefore, now every school should self-examine, thoroughly implement the ideological purge and prevention work. In the past, every time the school was on vacation. Often, the meticulousness and scruples of personal details were taken as the standard for evaluating students' moral conduct, and the like or dislike of emotions was often taken as the standard for adjusting teachers' personnel. Now, however, attention should be paid to ideological tendencies, and the correctness of thought should be taken as the measure of advance and retreat. This can be said to be a necessary measure for the country and the nation. Please pay attention to the Shanghai education community.

### Anglo-Japanese Relations Becoming Increasingly Tense, Britain Drafting New Ultimatum to Refute Japanese Demands on Concessions, British Ambassador to Japan Visits Arita to Discuss Arrest of British Military Officer

(London) The tense situation in Anglo-Japanese relations has recently become more serious, because the British government authorities are now drafting a new ultimatum to refute the Japanese side's demands on the concessions. It is heard that the ultimatum was prepared for drafting last week, but was delayed until recently in order to clarify the Japanese side's intentions. Generally, all its words are very certain and difficult to misunderstand, so in the future, if the Japanese side again infringes on the lives and property of British people, the British government will definitely retaliate. According to sources in the British Foreign Office, the British Consul General in Shanghai yesterday afternoon made a written protest against the "unreasonable" stabbing of British citizen Dinggler by the Japanese army, and reserved the right to demand compensation. It is understood that the reason why the British side is preparing to retaliate is due to: 1. The Japanese entry blocked the Chinese coast. 2. The Japanese side carried out anti-British activities in the occupied areas. 3. The Japanese side "restricted" the interests of British citizens in China. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Craig visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning and talked for more than an hour. According to Japanese officials, there are two main topics of conversation: 1. The extradition of Chinese activists in the Tianjin Concession. 2. The case of British military officer Lieutenant Colonel Spears and Lieutenant Cooper being arrested in Zhangjiakou (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### British Government Currently Considering Continuing Loans to China, Loan Program Will Be Implemented Sooner If Incidents Similar to the Dinggler Case Occur Again

(London) Sources in charge of Far Eastern affairs recently revealed that the British government is now considering continuing to provide credit loans to China so that it can purchase the military supplies it needs. It is noted that the UK has provided China with a credit loan of 500,000 pounds for the first time, but it has not yet been used up. Because British trucks are more expensive, the Chinese side has purchased American products with 250,000 pounds. Now that the quantity of British arms manufacturing has been increased and can be supplied to China, it will be possible to continue to provide credit loans to the country in the short term for the purchase of arms. However, if incidents similar to the Dinggler case in China and Shanghai continue to occur, the UK will also implement the loan sooner. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 9th)

### Japanese Consulate in Tianjin Seeks Understanding from US, French, and Other Consulates, Will Act Freely in the British Concession, US and French Consuls Telegraph Reports to Their Countries

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The Japanese Consulate in Tianjin is currently seeking understanding from the French, American, German, and Italian consulates because Japan will start to act freely in the British Concession. The US and French consuls have telegraphed reports to their countries on the seriousness of the situation in Tianjin. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have decided to blockade the British and French concessions in Tianjin, but before implementing the blockade, the Japanese side will issue a statement explaining that Japan, for the sake of self-defense, needs to implement the blockade regardless of any difficulties. The Tianjin Japanese authorities have issued instructions to the Japanese expatriates, asking everyone to cooperate with the Japanese authorities in order to succeed in the new plan. The blockade order is likely to be implemented on the 14th or 15th of this month. At that time, all those entering the Chinese or Japanese concessions from the British and French concessions will be inspected uniformly, and Chinese and foreign expatriates will be treated equally. The reason why the blockade order must be delayed until then is that the cargo of the Japanese shipping companies and Osaka Shosen Company must be completely transferred by the 14th. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Tianjin) Japanese sources said that the consuls general of France and the United States in Tianjin each telegraphed their governments yesterday afternoon, pointing out the serious situation in Tianjin and asking their governments to advise the British government to reconsider its attitude, because if the situation is not resolved, not only the British will be affected, but also the expatriates of other countries will be affected. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Tokyo) According to Tianjin news received by the Japanese newspaper, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin is seeking the understanding of the consuls of the United States, France, Germany, and Italy stationed in Tianjin for Japan's decision to adopt free actions against the British Concession in order to maintain the security of Tianjin. It is heard that the consuls of all countries sympathize and understand the Japanese side's position, and criticize the stubborn attitude of the British side. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Tianjin) The British and French concessions here heard that the Japanese would blockade them from June 14, so the British army has increased and patrolled the streets. Although the British consulate did not acknowledge the second ultimatum submitted by the Japanese side to transfer the murderers who assassinated the Tianjin Customs Supervisor, the Japanese intention to blockade the concession is extremely obvious. Employees in the puppet municipal government have now been ordered by the Japanese army to move out of the concession. At the same time, Japanese merchants operating in the concession are also transporting their goods out of the concession. The Yokohama Specie Bank today notified foreign banks that it would sever transactions with foreign banks on Monday next week. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

(Tianjin) The Tianjin branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank today notified foreign banks that it will withdraw its accounts with foreign banks starting next week. The notice is seen as another indication that the Japanese authorities are planning to blockade the British and French concessions in an attempt to force the British to accept the recent Japanese ultimatum demanding the imprisonment of the Chinese customs supervisor appointed by the Japanese who assassinated the Japanese. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

### Japanese Consul to Xiamen Travels from Taiwan to Japan

(Tokyo) The Japanese Consul to Xiamen, Uchida, arrived in Taipei yesterday and immediately departed for Tokyo to report to the authorities on the negotiations with the Kulangsu Municipal Council regarding the international settlement issue. Uchida repeatedly intimidated the people of third countries in China to isolate them. He stated that if Kulangsu were separated from Xiamen, Kulangsu would not be able to support itself. His criticism can be seen as Japan's plan to adopt intimidating behavior, similar to what was used against the British and French concessions in Tianjin. Because Japan is threatening to use force to manage Kulangsu, the Municipal Council there has yielded to two Japanese demands: to control terrorists and to cooperate with Japan in arresting terrorists in Kulangsu. Japan is still demanding the appointment of a Japanese person as the Chief of the Municipal Council and the appointment of a Japanese police chief. Uchida admitted that negotiations on Japan's other demands have been delayed, but he firmly believes that other negotiators "should wake up to the actual situation." According to reports, last month, the Marines of the United States, Britain, and France were sent ashore to prevent Japan from attempting to occupy the international settlement.

### Japanese Planes Raided Chongqing Last Night, Few Casualties, Three Japanese Planes Shot Down by Anti-Aircraft Guns, Houses Hit by Bombs, Fire Did Not Spread

(Chongqing) Officials here said yesterday that a total of three Japanese bombers that raided Chongqing last night were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese planes attacked in two waves: the first wave with nine planes and the second wave with twelve planes, specifically bombing Chongqing. Another wave of six planes bombed the outskirts of Chongqing. One plane was shot down in the first wave and two in the second wave. As a result of last night's raid, only nine people were injured or killed throughout the city, it is said. Another report states that three people died and six were injured. (June 10, Reuters)

(Chongqing) Last night, during the Japanese air raid, some people outside the bomb shelters looked up to watch the aerial combat between Chinese and Japanese planes and witnessed two Japanese bombers catching fire and crashing. The casualties from last night's raid were relatively few because many residents had already evacuated, and those who remained in the city mostly took shelter in trenches after hearing the alarm. The authorities now plan to allow only 83,000 civilians and 27,000 military personnel to stay in the city, so Chongqing still needs to evacuate 110,000 people. Many roofs in the lower city were destroyed by bombs yesterday. This morning, it was raining, and staff inside had to hold umbrellas to work. The bombs dropped by Japanese planes last night were larger than those used before. A Reuters reporter inspected the lower city this morning and saw many large craters. The opera house near Reuters was completely destroyed by fire, and there was a huge crater in the road leading to the Reuters office, 15 feet deep and 25 feet in diameter. Another bomb fell in the busiest part of Chongqing's entertainment area and completely destroyed the facade of Chongqing's largest theater. A house 30 yards behind the main street was hit directly by a bomb, and everything within an 80-foot radius was destroyed. The ground was blasted into a hole, larger than elsewhere. A rickshaw shop was also hit by a bomb, and the street was littered with wheels. Many bombs fell in areas where the Chinese authorities are currently demolishing houses to create firebreaks. Although many water pipes were destroyed last night, the fire did not spread and was quickly extinguished because of this. The water, electricity, and telephone lines at the Chongqing United Daily News were temporarily disrupted, but the newspaper was still published as usual this morning because emergency repair teams worked overnight to repair the damaged parts of the utilities. (June 10, Reuters)

(Chongqing) Chongqing was bombed again by Japanese planes last night. The first batch of nine Japanese planes arrived in Chongqing at 7 p.m., and eighteen more planes followed half an hour later, dropping many bombs in the suburbs, but the material damage was minimal. According to Chinese sources, 23 Japanese planes returned safely after dropping bombs, and four were shot down by Chinese air defense forces, it is said. (June 10, Huitong News Agency)

### Eight Thousand Brownshirts Stage Demonstration in Danzig, Shouting Slogans to Reclaim Danzig, Poland Takes Preventive Measures

Danzig. Lutz, the chief of staff of the German Brownshirts, arrived here by plane from Berlin yesterday. Among those welcoming him at the scene were Greiser, the speaker of the Danzig Municipal Senate, and Forster, the leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party. After Lutz's arrival, he will hold a grand review. Six thousand Brownshirts from East Prussia have been transferred here to participate in the review. Lutz will stay here for three days, and the German Propaganda Minister Goebbels will deliver an important political speech here on Sunday of this week (June 10, Huitong News Agency)

Danzig. Eight thousand Brownshirts from Danzig and East Prussia held a grand review here last night. Forster, the leader of the National Socialist Party branch, gave a speech last night, "The fate of the city of Danzig, which is being discussed by foreign countries, gives us the impression of the future of German cities. Since the German National Socialist Party has obtained political leadership in this independent German city, it deeply knows that the 100,000 Germans in Danzig are yearning to return to Germany, and this will definitely be fulfilled one day." Lutz, the chief of staff of the German Brownshirts, then took the stage and said, "The city of Danzig has its great National Socialist spirit, which is deeply believed by the Führer Hitler." At the same time, he sent a telegram to Führer Hitler, requesting the recovery of Danzig. (June 10, Huitong)

Warsaw. The Free City of Danzig is scheduled to hold a sports meet from today to the 13th. The German side has decided to send tens of thousands of stormtroopers to participate. Upon learning of this, the Polish government has reportedly decided to take various measures as a precaution. Political figures here believe that the aim of Germany's move is only to demonstrate to Poland and does not necessarily mean that the situation in Danzig is about to change. (June 9, Havas)

Danzig. According to reports here, Poland's attitude towards Danzig can be seen in two speeches: one was given by Polish cabinet member Kos-Głoskowski in Ciechocinek, emphasizing that Poland will not only fight to defend its current borders but will also seek complete victory and recover its lost territories. The other speech was given by a trade union leader, which included the statement "The next trade union meeting will be held in Danzig." (June 10, Huitong News Agency)

### One Police Officer Assassinated, Germany Imposes Severe Retaliation on Czechs, Levying Fines, People Endure in Silence, Large-Scale Search, More Than Three Hundred People Arrested

Prague. The German authorities have taken severe retaliation for the assassination of a German police officer in Kladno, an industrial center in northwestern Czech Republic. They have ordered all cinemas, theaters, schools, and public places to close, and ordered residents to close their doors and windows, shooting at those who are far away. In addition, Neurath, the German protector of Bohemia and Moravia, has ordered the Kladno area to pay a fine of 500,000 Czech crowns. According to the authorities, this fine should be paid by Jews and people known to support former Czech President Beneš, while the working class only needs to bear a small portion. Traffic is prohibited from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. the next morning. A wreath from Hitler was placed yesterday at the site of the police officer's murder. After the incident occurred on Thursday, the authorities immediately dismissed the mayor of Kladno, disarmed the Czech police, and prohibited people from gathering outdoors. (June 10, Reuters)

(Berlin) The authorities in Bohemia and Moravia have offered a reward of 50,000 crowns for the capture of the murderer, and ordered residents of the city to be prohibited from going out from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day, except for those who can prove they have a job. Anyone who knows the whereabouts of the murderer and does not report it will be shot, it is said. According to reports, German police have searched the central area of Kladno and the homes of former members of the Communist Party, and more than 300 people have been arrested. (June 9, Havas)

### League of Nations Opium Committee Completes Discussion of Far East Drug Trafficking Problem, Points Out Various Criticisms of Japan, Compiles Report Materials

Geneva. The League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium has been discussing the situation of drug trafficking in the Far East for three weeks and is nearing its end. It commissioned Gavrilović, the representative of Yugoslavia, to draft a report. However, he insisted on refusing to include in the report the points raised by the Chinese representative Hu Shih-tse, who accused Japan of poisoning China in order to achieve political goals. The Chinese representative protested as a result. The Advisory Committee discussed this matter today for two hours and finally, with the support of the majority of national representatives, decided to comply with the Chinese representative's request and include the criticisms of Japan as materials for the report.

### US-New Zealand Commercial Air Service to Begin on July 1, Stopping at Canton Island

(Washington) The commercial air service between the United States and New Zealand, run by Pan American Airways, is likely to begin on July 1, as it is necessary to wait for the completion of the construction of the air station on Canton Island in the Pacific. According to the recent agreement between Britain and the United States, Canton Island can be jointly managed by the two countries for the next 50 years. It is reported that Britain had asked the United States last year for the convenience of stopping planes in Hawaii and other Pacific islands, but the United States has not yet agreed, fearing that if this precedent is set, Japan will follow suit with similar demands. As for the issue of sovereignty over Canton Island, it is unlikely to occur within these 50 years, but after 50 years, due to the advancement of aircraft navigation, the importance of this island may be greatly reduced, so the issue of sovereignty may not need to be disputed at all, it is not known.

### French Protectorate to Implement Consular Visa System for Imports of Japanese Goods in Late June

The authorities of the port of Rabat in the French Moroccan Protectorate issued an order today stipulating that from the 20th of this month, all goods shipped from Japan must be accompanied by a special certificate signed by the commercial counselor of the French Embassy in Japan or a French consul, and countersigned by the Japanese authorities, before they can be allowed to be imported. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has strictly controlled exchange rates, and France's trade with Japan has changed from surplus to deficit. The French government has therefore implemented a consular visa system to remedy this situation. (June 9, Havas)

### Britain Implements Dual Policy to Eliminate European War, Willing to Resolve Disputes Through Negotiations, Building National Defense Continues Unabated

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech at a reception in Birmingham today, saying that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's speech in the House of Lords yesterday had made it clear that as long as there is a real hope of a solution, we are still prepared to discuss the demands of Germany or any other country at the round table. However, we must trust that such hope exists and that this solution must be reached through negotiations and not achieved by force. The Prime Minister continued that he believes the country has approved the policy he seeks to pursue, but to ensure the safety of the nation, he is pursuing two different but not conflicting approaches, namely, seeking to eliminate the possible causes of war on the one hand, and building Britain's strength on the other hand, so that when discussing the terms of a settlement, no country will take advantage of its weakness to force it to accept terms that are dishonorable or harmful to its major interests. Regarding the first part of this dual policy, he had to admit that he had encountered many disappointments and setbacks, and the assistance given by the countries he hoped to understand was very small. The other part, the building of national defense, has made great and rapid progress. He is now confident that no strong country would dare to lightly provoke a conflict with Britain. The Prime Minister's remarks were met with loud cheers from the entire audience. The Prime Minister continued, "The world knows that we will never use this great force to lightly provoke conflicts with others. Although there are often rumors of propaganda, reversing facts and confusing the public, I hope no one will be misled by these obviously distorted facts. However, there is one thing we must resist, and that is any step that attempts to disrupt the peace of Europe. If countries do not harbor such ambitions, there is no need to fear British force. Furthermore, the first part of our policy has not been abandoned, and I will continue to devote myself to stabilizing peace in the future. I hope to see this effort succeed in my lifetime." (June 9, Reuters)

(London) According to diplomatic circles' observation last night, there is a possibility of a new crisis in Europe. Four British spokesmen, led by Prime Minister Chamberlain, warned Germany yesterday against new expansion of force and at the same time invited Chancellor Hitler to make a peaceful settlement of various outstanding issues. Foreign diplomatic circles speculate that the British government's release of a large number of declarations is due to repeated reports of an impending crisis in Central Europe. The British side remains silent on the new crisis and the moderation of German construction, and is focusing all its attention on the early signing of a military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (June 10, Associated Press)

### Germany Expresses Skepticism Towards British Diplomatic Statements, Refuses to Be a Defendant in Colonial Demands

(Berlin) Official circles and the press here have expressed deep skepticism about the speeches made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax during yesterday's British parliamentary debate, saying that this speech was actually triggered by the frequent obstacles in British-American negotiations. Political figures declared that if Britain is willing to acknowledge the part that Germany occupies in the world, there is a clear way to express it, namely, to return the German colonies that were seized by the Treaty of Versailles. (June 9, Reuters)

(Berlin) After British Foreign Secretary Halifax made a declaration in the British House of Lords the day before yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech in Birmingham yesterday in response. The London Daily Mail commented that its intention was to invite Germany to participate in an international conference. The Berlin Stock Exchange Daily News retorted, "The Germany ruled by Führer Hitler is very different from the Germany of twenty years ago. It is astonishing that the gentlemen in London are still speaking to us in the tone of the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Do they think that great figures such as Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are willing to be defendants and allow those who call themselves democratic countries to organize a court to interrogate them?"

Foreign Minister Bonnet Clarifies French Foreign Policy, Confident that the Three-Nation Agreement Will Be Achieved, French-Turkish Negotiations Nearing Completion, Willing to Maintain Good Neighborly Relations with Spain

(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon to give a speech clarifying foreign policy. There are three main points: (1) Regarding the various difficulties in concluding a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, France is determined to make efforts to find a solution so that a satisfactory agreement can be established with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. (2) Regarding the two issues of Turkey's participation in the peace front in the Sanjak region, French-Turkish negotiations can be completed soon. (3) France has no intention of encircling Germany, and the current system of mutual assistance agreements only aims to ensure peace in Europe. The following is a summary of the speech:

Foreign Minister Bonnet first explained the progress of the three-nation talks, stating that France has never ignored the issues in Eastern Europe. The peace declaration issued by France and Germany on December 2 last year stated that France's relations with third countries would not be affected in any way. At that time, I declared to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop that this relationship referred to the 1921 French-Polish alliance and the 1935 French-Soviet mutual assistance treaty. Until April 13 of this year, the French government again suggested to the Soviet government to conclude a mutual assistance agreement based on the principle of absolute equality and reciprocity. Since then, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have conducted negotiations with a wider scope. However, due to the special status of certain related countries that should be taken into account, the current negotiations are not without difficulties, but the French government is determined to promote its resolution. In addition, Turkey is resolving various outstanding issues with the greatest sincerity, hoping that both sides can maintain good neighborly relations for a long time and cooperate sincerely in North Africa, Morocco. He concluded that at this moment, those who can accuse other countries of threatening each other with an encirclement policy, looking around all countries, are none other than France. In short, France does not use threats against any country, and is determined to respect the rights of all countries, and has no intention of dominating Europe. What it seeks is to maintain peace in Europe, which is the goal of the current mutual assistance system. (June 9, Havas)

### British Government to Prepare New Plan, Dispatch Central European Director to Moscow Tomorrow

(London) Regarding the issue of concluding a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British government has already prepared a new plan, which is prepared to be handed over to Strang, the Central European Director of the Foreign Office, to be taken to Moscow. Before this, it sought the views of the French authorities. French Ambassador Corbin informed Foreign Office official Cadogan this morning that the French government generally agreed with this new plan and only needed to make slight revisions in the wording. (June 10, Havas)

(Paris) Regarding the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic coastal countries, responsible parties recently declared that the British and French governments will submit several options to the Soviet government for its selection at the beginning of next week. Today, experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs studied the plan proposed by Britain, and tomorrow Foreign Minister Bonnet will inform the British government of France's views so that after they are submitted for discussion on the 12th of this month, the final instructions will be formulated and handed over to Strang, the Director of the Central European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to be taken to Moscow. (June 9, Havas)

(London) Regarding the issue of concluding a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Strang, the Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, conducted discussions with experts from the Foreign Office this morning to gain a full understanding of all aspects of the current British-Soviet negotiations and is scheduled to go to Moscow on the 12th of this month to assist Ambassador Seeds in conducting negotiations.

### British Army Doubles in Strength, Implementing Conscription, Eager Response from Recruits

(London) Secretary of War Hore-Belisha said in Plymouth today that Britain has become a great military power almost overnight. In these months, Britain will have more than 750,000 armed men, which is comparable to the total number of land armies in European countries. The doubling of the modern field army was announced in March of this year, and the response from recruits has been extremely enthusiastic. Only two months after the announcement, 152,000 officers and men had joined. It is unprecedented to achieve such results with any voluntary conscription system in peacetime. The current work of the War Office is unprecedentedly important. This year, the construction program alone requires an average cost of about one million pounds per week. (June 9, Reuters)

### France Deploys Ordinary Military Service, Demobilized Within Four Months

(Paris) French Premier Daladier declared today that those who have completed their ordinary military service but have not yet been discharged due to the recent crisis, or who have been recalled later, will be demobilized within four months. The fortress troops managing the Maginot Line will also be discharged on September 1, and other troops will be implemented one month later. (June 9, Reuters)

### French Chief of Staff Hurries Back to Paris

(London) The Chief of the French General Staff, General Gamelin, recently visited Britain and hurried back to Paris yesterday. The Yorkshire Post (the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden) commented, "When the British and French allied forces fight on the French front in the future, General Gamelin will serve as the commander-in-chief, as expected by the public. This man is a great military strategist, the first person after the famous French General Foch. During the European War, he assisted Marshal Joffre's staff and was responsible for the opportunity. In the Battle of the Marne, the German army was ambushed and defeated, which was mostly due to General Gamelin's strategic planning. In short, after the war breaks out in the future, the military strength, military strategy, military orders, and various resources of Britain and France can be combined." (June 10, Havas)

### Germany and Italy Induce Spain to Join the Axis, Germany Sends Personnel to Spain to Promote Economic Relations

(Rome) According to reliable sources from the Fascist Party last night, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano plans to officially visit Madrid on June 21. The Fascist Party predicts that after Ciano meets with General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Military Government, a political and military pact between Madrid, Rome, and Berlin will be signed, adding a third border to France for the Rome-Berlin Axis. (June 10, Associated Press)

(Berlin) Dr. Walda, a counselor of the German Ministry of Economics, set off for Spain today. This trip is not intended to conduct formal talks with Spanish leader General Franco, but only to study the promotion of bilateral economic relations, with the supply of mercury, lead, manganese, and other minerals produced in Spain to Germany, and the promotion of German goods in the Spanish market, being particularly important. In addition, the dispatch of many German technicians to Spain to build factories and highways will also be studied. (June 10, Havas)

### Foreign Minister of Romania's Inquiry: Conveying Southern Views to Turkish and Greek Capitals

Bucharest, Romania – Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu will depart tonight at 10 PM to visit Turkey and Greece. He is expected to return to Romania on the 19th or 20th of this month. According to political sources, "Following the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Turkey and the United Kingdom, the Yugoslav government believed it conflicted with the Balkan Entente and raised objections. Foreign Minister Gafencu's trip, in his capacity as chairman of the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Entente, will convey the views of the Southern countries to Turkey. However, this move by the Southern countries, instigated by Germany and Italy, is not something Romania can endorse. It is firmly believed that Greece and Turkey share Romania's view." To avoid internal divisions within the Balkan Entente, efforts should still be made to appease Yugoslavia. (Havas, 9th)

### Terrorist Incident in London: Bombings Repeatedly Occurring, Attributed to Irish Republicans

(London) – Another incident has occurred in London, apparently in sympathy with the Irish Republican Army. While sorting mail at the North London Postal Headquarters, a postal worker detonated a package of letters, destroying several letters and parcels. Fortunately, no one was injured. At the Euston post office, while opening a mailbag, a fire was discovered inside. It was immediately extinguished. It was found that the fire was caused by a rubber bomb, but there was no major damage. A bomb explosion also occurred at the West Central district post office. Currently, police are monitoring all mailboxes and post offices in London, paying attention to envelopes with strange addresses. The police have been ordered to find and dismantle the organization of these terrorists and arrest those directing the violence. Therefore, many London police officers and detectives have had their weekend holidays canceled. (Reuters, 10th)

### South Regent Returns Home

(Berlin) – Following Prince Paul's recent visit, rumors spread that Germany and Yugoslavia were planning to sign a treaty.

### Sharp Decline in US-German Trade

(Washington) – According to the Department of Commerce, trade between the United States and Germany has decreased significantly in recent months. In the first quarter of 1939, US exports to Germany totaled $18,017,000, a decrease of one-third compared to $25,578,000 in the same period last year. It is reported that the sharp decline in US-German trade is due to retaliatory actions taken by Germany, as the US, dissatisfied with Hitler's government, imposed a "retaliatory tax" of 25% on all German goods entering the United States.

### British King and Queen Arrive in New York: Received with Enthusiastic Welcome, Boated and Conversed with Roosevelt, Visited Congress and Washington's Tomb

(New York) – Amidst cheers of welcome from the masses, the British King and Queen left Washington at 11:45 PM last night by special train and arrived today in Red Bank, New Jersey. Upon disembarking, they were greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd. They then transferred to cars and were escorted by military police to Hancock Field, arriving at 9:35 AM. Cheers were heard all along the way. They then boarded the USS Warrington destroyer and headed towards New York. Upon boarding, the fort fired a 21-gun salute. Twenty naval escort ships accompanied them. There were also many yachts full of spectators, all displaying flags with words welcoming the British King. Seven thousand British expatriates also chartered ships to follow. At 11:10 AM, they arrived safely in New York. Governors Island fired a 22-gun salute in tribute. Fifteen minutes after landing, the King and Queen will travel by car directly to the World's Fair on Long Island for lunch. In the afternoon, they will visit the Canadian, Irish, and British pavilions. At 4:15 PM, they will leave the fairgrounds and head to Manhattan Island to visit Columbia University, and then to Hyde Park for a banquet with President and Mrs. Roosevelt. It is expected that at least two million people will welcome the British King and Queen upon their arrival in New York. (Reuters, 10th)

(Washington) – Today, Friday, President Roosevelt, as usual, met with reporters at the White House. According to his remarks, "King George VI and Queen Elizabeth are both amiable and approachable, and they have been deeply impressed by what they have seen since arriving in the United States." This afternoon, while boating with the King and Queen on the Potomac River, I engaged in private conversations regarding the international situation, but these were merely for the exchange of views. At the same time, the King and Queen met with British expatriates in the area at the British Embassy. Afterward, they drove to Congress, where the families of the members of Congress gathered on the lawn in front of the Capitol to cheer. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Vice President Garner, and the Speaker of the House, Bankhead, immediately led the King and Queen into the Capitol. All the members of Congress stood in two rows, applauding their welcome. The King and Queen, introduced by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Bankhead, shook hands with the members as a courtesy. They then traveled directly by car to the National Armory dock on the banks of the Potomac River. President and Mrs. Roosevelt were already waiting on a yacht. The yacht then cast off. In addition to several members of the US Cabinet, the British Ambassador, Lord Lothian, was also on board. The weather was clear today, and the climate was cooler than yesterday. After arriving at Mount Vernon, the King and Queen first laid a wreath at Washington's tomb and observed a moment of silence in tribute. They then visited Washington's former residence. The King and Queen toured each room and were very interested in the various memorabilia. The Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, US Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Woodring, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, among others, accompanied them. They then went together to tour the garden (which was where Washington used to ride his horse 140 years ago). An elderly Scottish gardener presented the Queen with a bouquet of flowers. The King and Queen and the President and Mrs. Roosevelt then proceeded to Arlington National Cemetery to visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the European War. They paused briefly at Fort Hunt, where unemployed people residing within the camp gave them an enthusiastic welcome. Upon arriving at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, they were greeted by General Craig, Chief of Staff of the Army, and a squad of soldiers presented arms in salute. The band played the national anthems of Britain and the United States. The King and Queen placed a wreath at the tomb and mourned for a long time. They then returned in several cars to the White House. (Havas, 9th)

(Berlin) – Today, the British King and Queen entered the Capitol here to meet with members of Congress. The cheers were deafening. 3,500 seats were arranged in front of the Capitol, all occupied by the wives of members of Congress and other female guests. The King and Queen did not enter the chambers but shook hands with senators and representatives individually in the central hall of the Capitol. The King and Queen first held a reception at the British Embassy, then drove to the Capitol. Cheers along the way were incessant. Senators gathered earlier at the Capitol, amusing themselves by mocking senators wearing formal morning dress. Then the King and Queen entered the domed hall. Senators and other members of Congress applauded for several minutes. Congressman Boylan escorted the King and Queen arm-in-arm past the senators and representatives. The King and Queen looked very happy, talking amiably with everyone. Soon, a delegation of members of Congress escorted the King and Queen down the steps of the Capitol. The King and Queen boarded a car and went to the Naval Shipyard, where they met President Roosevelt on the presidential yacht and took a trip to Mount Vernon. Senator Pittman, President Pro Tempore of the Senate, later said that the King had expressed his gratitude to Congress through the Queen. The Queen said, "We cannot express in words our gratitude for the universal friendship we have received." Mrs. Roosevelt, when meeting with reporters today, praised the Queen as a young monarch with a social heart who deeply understands the difficulties of many people's lives and work. Yesterday's garden party at the British Embassy was not open to the public. This morning, however, the embassy was open, and all British nationals, regardless of race or creed, could enter, gathering on the vast lawns to greet the King and Queen. There were black people from the West Indies, and veterans who had been reviewed by the King, as well as nurses, consuls, civilians, and children. A South African Sultan wearing a robe was overjoyed when he shook hands with the King. The weather today was still very hot. The King placed a wreath of white lilies on the marble tomb of George Washington at Mount Vernon. The Queen, President Roosevelt, and Mrs. Roosevelt watched from the side. This simple ceremony, seen by only a few, may be more symbolic of the friendly and peaceful ties between the two great English-speaking nations than any other event during the King and Queen's trip. One hundred and fifty years ago, George Washington drove out the redcoats of King George III. The headline of today's New York World-Telegram read, "Britain Retakes Washington." This phrase aptly summarizes the impression the general public in New York has of the success of the King and Queen's visit to the United States. The simplest fact is that the King and Queen are visiting America at a time when the American people are cherishing the whole concept of democracy, and America is treating them as ambassadors of a democratic nation. Pessimists initially thought that there would be many difficulties in the King and Queen's visit to the United States, but now all these fears have been dispelled. (Reuters, 9th)

### German News Agency Exerts All Efforts to Sow Discord

(London) – The German News Agency's report on President Roosevelt's reception of the British King and Queen clearly makes every effort to sow discord and undermine relations. One report claimed, "When the King and Roosevelt greeted each other, Roosevelt forced a smile." It also said, "The King appeared tired due to the long journey, but the Americans still subjected him to extremely lengthy programs, causing him great trouble. The most inappropriate thing was that when hosting the King, Roosevelt even included the envoys of Czechoslovakia and Albania." Furthermore, the official German news agency DMB even claimed that Mrs. Roosevelt was a communist, stating, "After Mrs. Roosevelt described her plans for hosting the King and Queen at a Communist gathering in Washington, she even invited black singers to entertain the King and Queen at a White House banquet, to fulfill her communist spirit." It should be noted that Mrs. Roosevelt addressed the Labor Congress and never spoke to the Communist Party. (Associated Press, 10th)

### US Film Processing Workers Demand Wage Increase and Strike, Affecting Newsreels of British King

(New York) – After the newsreels of the King and Queen's arrival in Washington were completed, they were sent to the American Film Industries film processing company in New Jersey for developing and printing. However, the film processing workers at the company took this opportunity to announce a strike, demanding a wage increase. Therefore, if the strike at the company cannot be resolved immediately, cinemas in the United States will not be able to screen the newsreels of the King and Queen's arrival in Washington by the end of this week.

### The Completion of the Yunnan-Burma Road: Over 960 Kilometers Long, Ministry of Communications Allocated Over Three Million in Funding, Local People Enthusiastically Provided Labor

Kunming Airmail – The Yunnan-Burma Road has been open to traffic for several months. Recently, Yang Wenqing, a manager of the road bureau, traveled to Rangoon for business and took the opportunity to inspect the road. Upon his return, he reported on the road's current conditions: Since the start of the national resistance war, Yunnan has become an important rear base, and its position has become increasingly critical. The development of transportation between Yunnan and Burma, particularly the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Road, has become a necessity. Chairman Long, recognizing this, resolutely advanced the construction of the road, contacting the Ministry of Communications for joint management and ordering all counties along the route to start construction immediately and complete it within four months. The officials and people of the counties, deeply aware of the importance of rear transportation, understood the government's intentions and concentrated manpower and resources to work day and night. Within half a year, the earth road was largely completed and passable. Subsequently, the Road Bureau, in conjunction with the Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Administration, made practical improvements, and it has now become the best road in Yunnan. Whether it is the rainy season or the dry season, regardless of the number of vehicles, it is passable without hindrance. The road line, engineering, management, and transportation are briefly described below:

Route

Starting from Kunming, passing through Anning, Lufeng, Guangtong, Chuxiong, Zhennan, Xiangyun, Midu, Fengyi, Xiaguan, Dali, Yangbi, Yongping, Xuelong, Baoshan, Longling, Luxi, to Wanting on the Yunnan-Burma border, the total length is over 960 kilometers. The average daily travel distance is 200 kilometers, so it is estimated that it will take five days to reach the border. However, due to station stops and other factors, it takes six days to reach Lashio in Burma.

Engineering

The Yunnan-Burma Road passes through many mountains, swift rivers, and large rivers. Bridge culverts and stone masonry make construction exceptionally difficult, so construction is quite laborious. The engineering process is divided into two sections: Kunming-Xiaguan and Xiaguan-Wanting. (A) The Kunming-Xiaguan section, from Kunming to Xiaguan, is over 410 kilometers long and was completed in 1935. However, due to financial difficulties, many bridge culverts along the route were built with wood, and the road surface was not paved below Lufeng. Once it rained, the road surface became muddy, and vehicles could not pass. Last year, in order to expedite the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Road, active measures were taken to improve it. All unpaved road surfaces, over 300 kilometers long, and wooden bridge culverts, over 100, were paved separately. The largest project in this section was from Lufeng to Yipinglang, over 20 kilometers long, mostly stone masonry, which cost more and took longer to build. It took two years to complete the road. (B) The Xiaguan-Wanting section, from Xiaguan to Wanting, is over 550 kilometers long. Construction began in December 1937, and the earth road and temporary bridges and culverts were largely completed and passable by May 1938. Subsequently, the road surface was continuously paved, and the roadbed and bridge culverts were repaired. For one year, tens of thousands of laborers were working on the road every day, which shows the magnitude of the project and the great effort involved. Among them, the stone masonry along the Cangjiang and Lujiang rivers and the bridges over the Cangjiang, Lujiang, and Bijiang rivers were the largest projects in this section, which cost more and took longer. They have now all been completed. All new bridges can carry more than ten tons. The reason why this new road could be completed in a short period of time is that the Ministry of Communications allocated 3.2 million yuan in national currency for bridge and stone masonry expenses, and that the people of each county enthusiastically shouldered the labor burden. From the start of construction to the completion date, each county contributed over 3 million laborers. These laborers provided their own food and came from 3-5 or 6-7 stations away. They worked hard and slept in the open at night. No matter how difficult, they worked tirelessly. This spirit of not counting hardships and sacrifices is truly admirable. The 170-kilometer section from Wanting to Lashio, which is within Burma, has long been completed and open to traffic, and active improvements are being made. It is generally good, but most of the road workers are Chinese laborers, who return to China in the summer. The road maintenance organization is not as complete as in Yunnan. If there is excessive rain, whether or not it will affect traffic is still difficult to predict.

Management

Building roads is certainly difficult, but managing roads is even more difficult. The most important aspects of management are road maintenance, tree planting, and operations. All these aspects cannot be done well without a lot of funds. The province's road funds are insufficient. During this wartime period, management equipment is difficult. Moreover, the Yunnan-Burma Road is crucial for military transport, so it seems necessary to coordinate management for the sake of unified transportation. The provincial government and the Ministry of Communications agreed that, during the war of resistance, the road would be temporarily taken over by the Ministry of Communications. In addition to compensating the province for the road construction loan of over 800,000 yuan in installments, the Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Administration was established to handle road maintenance and transportation matters. All projects have now been transferred from the Road Bureau to the Administration. In addition to establishing two engineering offices and ten engineering sections to handle engineering, road maintenance teams, emergency teams, and technician teams are also set up in each section to repair the road at any time, and preparations are being made for a large number of road maintenance materials to meet emergency needs. With this arrangement, even if the road surface cannot be prevented from collapsing during the rainy season, maintenance is easy and will not cause major obstacles. As for the administrative organization, on the one hand, cars are purchased, and on the other hand, rubber-wheeled carts are prepared to supplement the lack of car transport. On the other hand, stations, gas stations, repair shops, hostels, etc. are set up in each county along the way. Once the equipment is ready, business will start, which will be more convenient for travelers and merchants.

Transportation

Transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road is divided into military transport and commercial transport. Military transport is the responsibility of the Southwest Transport Office, and commercial transport is the responsibility of the Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Administration. Vehicles from the Yunnan Automobile Company and the Automobile Business Office can also operate as before. Currently, an average of over one hundred vehicles travel back and forth every day, which is the general situation of transportation. In short, the Yunnan-Burma Road is currently the only international transportation route.

### Japanese Warships Harass Fishing Boats off Dachunshan Island, Wenling: Fishermen Afraid to Fish

Wenling Correspondence – Dachunshan Island, a subordinate island of Wenling County's Dongxiang area, was originally a fishing area. The residents of the island all make a living by fishing. Now that the fishing season is here, yellow croaker and cuttlefish are extremely abundant. The fishermen all drive their own fishing boats, in groups, to fish together on the ocean. The proceeds can sustain them for half a year. However, two Japanese warships have recently appeared in the ocean, patrolling back and forth, with the aim of seizing fishing rights, freely invading and catching fish, and occasionally launching speedboats to chase fishing boats. Currently, the residents of the island, in order to avoid danger, no longer dare to fish on the ocean.

### Huang Bingzhong Killed in Nanxing Town, Changshu: Former Chief Detective of Jiangyin

Changyinsha Correspondence – Huang Bingzhong (alias Huang Gang), a native of Sigang, Jiangyin, was 67 years old. He was formerly the chief of the detective team of the county government, with thousands of followers. He served in public office for nearly fifty years and had no enemies. When the situation changed a few years ago, Huang maintained his integrity and was not swayed by others. He often lived in the countryside or on the sandbars. The day before yesterday, he was suddenly shot dead with a Mauser pistol in a small teahouse in Nanxing Town (belonging to Changshu County). It is said that the reason for his death contained jealousy. However, after Huang's death, the security of several villages in Jiangyin, which relied on Huang for maintenance, will inevitably be affected to some extent.

### Jinshan Pinghu Self-Defense Corps Attacks Japanese Troops at Songyin: Over Twenty Japanese Troops Killed or Wounded, and Pseudo-Police Translators Captured Alive

Jinshan Correspondence – On the morning of June 4th, Chen Jizhong, commander of the 5th Company under Shen Junsheng, commander of the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps of Jinshan and Pinghu counties, led forty soldiers, including Xia Xinzhai, Zhang Longsheng, and Zhu A'da, to attack the Japanese troops at Songyin. First, twelve daredevils disguised as farmers, hiding pistols, penetrated close to the Japanese garrison, waiting for an opportunity to rush in and capture Japanese soldiers alive. At the same time, they carried machine guns and hand grenades on the west side of the Zhangjing River, lurking two hundred meters away, providing flanking fire cover. Hearing gunfire in the street, knowing that the assault had begun, the company commander also led the team to rush to the highway bridge. Although there were sixty or seventy Japanese soldiers, they were caught off guard and hurriedly fought back, only using small mortars and not having time to use guns. Therefore, the Chinese troops were able to rush to the bridgehead and see over twenty Japanese soldiers dead or wounded, falling to the ground. The company commander then led the team to charge across the bridge, intending to capture all

### Gongshu, a Suburb of Hangzhou, Has Become a Scorched Earth: Chinese and Japanese Troops Engaged in Three Fierce Battles, Over a Thousand Japanese Troops Annihilated

Hangzhou Correspondence – The Japanese army camp in the Hushui area of Hangzhou's suburbs was besieged by over two thousand soldiers of a certain Chinese division at about 10 PM on the 8th. The Japanese troops in that area stubbornly resisted, and the two sides engaged in fierce fighting. Subsequently, the Japanese army retreated in defeat, and the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue. When they reached the vicinity of Gongbu, they encountered Japanese reinforcements, so fierce fighting broke out again. The Chinese army, seeing that the Japanese side was strong, feigned a retreat, luring the Japanese army deep into the area. When they reached the place, the Chinese army surrounded the Japanese army with a surprise tactic and set fire to nearby Japanese army camps. The Japanese army repeatedly charged desperately, attempting to break the encirclement, but ultimately failed. As a result, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were annihilated. The next day, the highest military authorities of the Japanese army in Hangzhou mobilized a large army to advance towards the area north of the villa and Gongbu. The Chinese army used the trench warfare fortifications built by the Japanese to inflict heavy blows on the Japanese army. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army moved slightly back, and a big fire broke out in the area, destroying countless civilian houses. It is estimated that 31 houses were burned in Jiangzhang Bridge, 86 in Maiyu Bridge, over 100 in Zijing Street, 66 from No. 31 to No. 52 of Hongshibanqiao Straight Street and Heyan Lane, and also after Wulin Gate and Fenghuang Bridge, the area from the Gong pseudo-District Office to Fuhai Lane was also completely burned. Annihilation, the Japanese army fired machine guns densely, causing failure to fall short. Later, they heard the signal to withdraw from the street, and they safely returned to their original defenses. Their bravery in entering the street was commendable. The captured puppets included Xiao Tie Gui, the patrol chief Hu Fugen, and two Japanese soldiers' heads, and captured alive two Japanese translators, Qin Shaozeng, from Shaoxing, and two pseudo-policemen, Wang Kuicai, etc. Subsequent investigations revealed that over ten Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, seven or eight were injured, two heads were captured, and four were captured alive. It is said that Xiao Tie Gui's sister was intimate with a Japanese army leader, so the Japanese army put a wooden fake head on his headless body and put it in a coffin.

### 日軍補充兵額　强拉華人當兵　迫充先鋒無一生還

Recently, the Japanese army, entrenched in Jinghu, Sujia, Huhang, and the three railway lines, have only one or two thousand troops at most in each stronghold, and as few as thirty or forty. Japanese Army Commander Yamada Otozō telegraphed Tokyo for assistance, but as a result, very few reinforcements were sent to the Japanese troops on each line. It is now known that Yamada, in order to increase the strength of his garrison, ordered the Japanese troops in Su, Song, Chang, and Zhen areas to forcibly conscript local young men to supplement the army, thereby achieving the goal of "using Chinese to control Chinese." Therefore, the Japanese army in these areas is now directing the puppet county government agencies and the puppet Baojia chiefs to quickly send young men from door to door. According to the method, all those aged eighteen to forty-five are not exempt from military service. If they falsely report their age or evade and abscond on any excuse, they will be punished by military law. However, the eligible young men in various places have expressed their unwillingness to act as accomplices to the tiger. The Japanese authorities then secretly ordered the Japanese troops stationed in various places to forcibly pull Chinese people at any time, falsely pretending to be Japanese soldiers, and send them to the front lines to fight. It is now known that the Japanese troops in Jiashan and Fengjing set out a few days ago to Dongxiang to harass the Chinese army. First, they forcibly dragged more than one hundred Chinese people in the streets, tea shops, and other places, forced them to wear military uniforms, and used them as the vanguard of the Japanese army. When they arrived at a certain place, they were swept by the Chinese army with concentrated machine guns. As a result, the Chinese who were falsely acting as Japanese soldiers were completely sacrificed, and the Japanese troops in the rear saw this situation and fled in embarrassment. Also, the Japanese army in Xiashi rushed to the Ganhe Shang Theater one evening a few days ago and tied up all two hundred or so audience members. They were forced to change their clothes and set off at the headquarters, and no one has been seen alive to this day. It is said that Huzhou, Deqing, Pinghu, and other places also have similar incidents.

### 運堤培修工程　測量隊出發　車新兩壩堵復完工

Xinghua correspondence: Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Government considered the east and west dikes of the canal to be the guarantee for the counties in the lower reaches of the river to resist floods, from Erbao in Huai'an to Hehua Pond in Jiangdu, with a total length of 140 kilometers. There are many low, thin, damaged, and dangerous sections of the two dikes, which should be repaired as soon as possible to prevent flooding in the autumn. For example, there are more than 20 gate holes along the embankment section that allow water to escape, and more than 100 places where the bank of the dike near the river has collapsed, which should be repaired in time. It was estimated that the amount of money needed for the project was telegraphed to the central government for allocation. It is now known that the provincial government has based its decision on the canal engineering bureau's report. The surveying team for the project has been organized and personnel have been allocated, and it is planned to first engage in surveying work in order to plan the start of construction. The team is led by Xue Yiying, a technician from the Huaipi Section Office, as the captain of the first team, and Zhang Longchuan, a technician from the Jiangbao Section Office, as the captain of the second team. They set off to work separately on the 23rd and 25th of last month. Once the survey is completed, it will be telegraphed for review, and so on.

Also, news: The provincial government has based its decision on the reports from the Canal Engineering Bureau and the Gaoyou County Government that the damming and restoration project of Chexin and the repair project of the north and south Guotou dams were all completed on the 24th of last month. The provincial government considers that since the project has been reported as completed, it will send personnel to inspect and accept it in the near future to clear the procedures.

### 中西運動會　西靑果獲冠軍　麗都第三華聯第四　麥令多麗都一分得亞軍　昨又創五項大會新記錄

The open track and field meet sponsored by the Shanghai International Track and Field Association, where nine heroes from China and the West competed, continued yesterday afternoon at the American Boys' School sports field on Avenue Petain. As expected, the Western YMCA won the championship with 65 points, McLing ranked second with 37 points, Lido was a pity only one point behind, ranking third with 36 points, and Hualian and the Russian Army ranked fourth with 24 points each. Next were the School Union, Peide, and the French Army. Portugal did not score any points. Yesterday was a good day for track and field competitions, with bright sun and gentle breeze. The guests were more enthusiastic than last time. A total of eleven finals were held yesterday, and five new records were set, for a total of seven records set over the two days. Wu Bixian's 1.82 meters (5 feet 11 and 3/4 inches) was the best. Western YMCA's Fonseca and McLing's Finke were the heroes of yesterday, each winning two championships. In the environment and air of this isolated island, it is commendable that the Lido and Hualian teams of Chinese athletes achieved such results. After the competition, Chairman White LaTor thanked all parties, and the grand and enthusiastic China-West Games came to an end.

Finals shorthand

In the 100-yard dash, Edward, a strong player from the Western School Union, and Dai Shuguo from Hualian were absent due to illness, so only four people competed. Chen Yongfu had an excellent start, but after 80 yards, Fonseca from the Western YMCA came out and won first place. Chen Yongfu finished second by a chest. The result was a mediocre 10.4 seconds.

In the 220-yard dash, four people also started. Fonseca won easily in 22.8 seconds, which was one of the outstanding results of yesterday, breaking Edward's record of 23.5 seconds. Lido's Zeng Rongzhong and Liu Yongsen finished third and fourth. In the 440-yard dash, McLing's Finke took the lead after the start and had enough leg strength to rush to the finish line, leaving the second-place Milonov about 25 meters behind. No Chinese were selected. The result was 51.3 seconds, a new record, breaking his own record of 51.5 seconds.

In the high hurdles, Hualian's Li Zhenzhong started relatively late. At the 50-yard mark, the School Union's Hale was neck and neck in front. The competition was very fierce. Zhenzhong finally won the first place by one meter in 16.6 seconds. Lido's Wang Guozhen finished fourth.

In the 880-yard run, ten people started, and Chinese accounted for three. No one could compete with Finke. Lido's Guan Youwen and the Western YMCA's Yenas formed a group. Zhang Liang chased from behind. In the last 200 yards, Guan Youwen was finally surpassed by Yenas. As a result, Finke won first place in 2 minutes and 1 second, a new record. Yenas finished second, 20 yards behind. Guan and Zhang were selected for third and fourth place.

In the two-mile run, 14 people started. Guan Youwen and Wang Zhenglin took the lead, followed by the French Army's Fotia and Hualian's Liu Guangfa, who were difficult to distinguish. After one mile, Lido's Wang Zhenglin stood out, and Fotia gradually became unable to support himself. Liu Guangfa rose to second place after Wang. Fotia fell behind Guan. In the end, Wang Zhenglin dropped Liu by 40 yards, and Guan finished third.

The 880-yard relay was the final deciding event. If Lido won the championship, they could surpass McLing and win the runner-up. As expected, they were amazing. Zeng Rongzhong and Chen Yongfu took the lead in the first two legs, but unfortunately, the third leg was caught up by the Western YMCA's Dickson, and Liu Yongsen was defeated by Fonseca, which was a pity. As a result, Lido finished third in total points.

High Jump The high jump was one of the most successful events for Chinese athletes yesterday. Wu Bixian's championship was expected. The beauty of crossing the bar was met with thunderous applause. When the height was increased to 1.76 meters (5 feet 9 inches), only Wu Bixian, Li Zhenzhong, and McDolly remained. Lin Zuozhu and Zhu Jinyuan had been eliminated. At 1.80 meters (5 feet 11 inches), Wu Bixian jumped over it in one leap. Li and Mai were eliminated. When the height was increased to 1.82 meters (5 feet 11 and 3/4 inches), Bixian's bar was knocked down by his hand strap on the second jump, which was a pity for everyone. He finally jumped over it on the third jump. He was still .005 meters short of Zhou Shizhao's 1.825 meters at the International Games, breaking the previous conference record of 5 feet 10 inches by Polokokefu. Li Zhenzhong and McDolly jumped one more time to determine the third place.

High hurdles champion Li Zhenzhong

In the triple jump, Fonseca won the championship with 45 feet 1 and 7/8 inches (equivalent to 13.76 meters) on the third jump. Volorenkov also got 44 feet and 3/4 on the third jump. Zhang Jiakui got 43 feet 10 and 1/8 inches on the first jump, but he did not improve after that and got third place. The fourth place was Osler with 42 feet 4 inches.

In the discus throw, Ke Qing overwhelmed the crowd with 133 feet and 3/4 (43.09 meters), breaking the old Shanghai International record of 131 feet 10 inches held by Kaufman. The second place was Dickson with 128 feet 1 inch, the third place was Ross with 125 feet 6 inches, and the fourth place was McDolly with 120 feet 9 inches. All Chinese players were eliminated.

In the pole vault, the previous champion, Abramov, still won the first place with a score of 11 feet 3 inches. McDolly, although his score was the same as Abramov, had more errors and was ranked second. The remaining Shen Ji'en, Huang Guoxing, Huarkan, and Antson had the same scores. The ranking was determined by the number of errors. Shen was eliminated, and Huang and An got the third and fourth places.

### 日軍助長反英行動　英再提書面抗議　英曾努力遏止反日宣傳　亦請日方注意反英文字

The English-language "Great America Evening News" reported that the British Consul General Philip today (the 10th) sent a written note to the Japanese Consul General Miura, protesting that the Japanese army in the Pudong area hindered the Chinese workers hired by the British side, allowing them to be the Chinese workers of the Luen Chang Printing Factory, and promoted anti-British harassment. This confirms the oral protest issued on Thursday evening. In addition to requesting the containment of anti-British activities in Pudong, the note also cited the anti-British text published in the Japanese-controlled "Xin Shen Bao" on June 7th and requested attention. It also mentioned the efforts of the British authorities to contain anti-Japanese propaganda in Chinese newspapers of British merchants, and requested the Japanese side to also contain the anti-British text in the "Xin Shen Bao".

Plainclothes Japanese Prevent Resumption of Work

"Continental Daily" reported yesterday (9th) that the British Consulate authorities are preparing to submit another written protest to the Japanese Consul General within the next few days. This protest will confirm the oral representations made by Philip to Miura on Thursday morning. The representations submitted by Philip are related to the fact that the Japanese army in Pudong is promoting anti-British harassment. Philip stated that plainclothes armed Japanese on Thursday hindered the Chinese workers hired by the British Luen Chang Printing Factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, from returning to the factory to resume work, and requested the Japanese Consul General to take the necessary steps to prevent the Japanese from taking such actions.

The Tingler Case: Protest on Three Points

"North China Daily News" reported that the British Consulate authorities yesterday afternoon (9th) submitted a strongly worded protest to the Japanese authorities regarding the incident in which Tingler, a foreman at the Luen Chang Company textile factory, was stabbed with a spear by a Japanese sailor on Tuesday morning and died of serious injuries at the Public Hospital on Wednesday morning. It was stated that Tingler's stabbing with a spear was unnecessary, that the Japanese authorities did not provide sufficient medical treatment, and that the Japanese side refused to allow British personnel to see Tingler, who was seriously injured. It was learned yesterday that the English note mentioned the following three points: The stabbing of Tingler with a spear to death was unnecessary; the Japanese authorities did not make arrangements for sufficient medical treatment that could have saved his life; on the afternoon of June 6th, the Japanese authorities refused to allow the British Consulate authorities to meet with Tingler. The British side formally and verbally requested that a foreign doctor be sent, but the Japanese authorities first refused and only allowed it after a long time.

Japan Pays Attention to Anti-British

At a press conference hosted by the Japanese side yesterday, the spokesman of the Embassy stated that the British Consul General Philip visited the Japanese Consul General Miura on Thursday to protest the anti-British movement in Pudong under the control of the Japanese side and requested the cooperation of the Japanese side to contain it. When asked about the attitude of the Japanese side, the spokesman said that considerable attention would be paid to Philip's request. A reporter said that the Japanese side has armed soldiers in Pudong, so given the position of the Japanese side, if it wants to contain the anti-British demonstrations, it can do so. The spokesman replied that the Japanese side would pay considerable attention to the striking workers, but even the British authorities do not want to interfere in labor-management disputes. The current situation makes the situation very complicated. When asked whether the Japanese side would prevent anti-British conferences that only have political meaning and do not involve labor and management, the spokesman replied, "You are deliberately asking this question. If peace and order are maintained for a long time, the Japanese side may not interfere."

Tingler's Funeral Attracts Many Mourners

Tingler's funeral was held yesterday afternoon. The coffin was covered with a British flag and a wreath. The coffin was placed in the Hongqiao Road Cemetery.

Major Noji, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps who stabbed Tingler on Tuesday, also went to the cemetery in plain black clothes. He bowed to the hearse as it passed by.

### Approaching Dragon Boat Festival - Various Industries Confer on Account Collection - Request from Zhejiang for Passage on Shanghai-Ningbo Cargo Ships - Request for Issuance of Certificates by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce

June 21st is the Dragon Boat Festival. Various industries, with the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, are not only starting to prepare everything but are also sending personnel to collect accounts in various parts of eastern Zhejiang. Although navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo has resumed, passenger travel is still prohibited on the ships. Therefore, the various industries held a joint meeting the other day to discuss the issue of account collection during the Dragon Boat Festival, resolving to request the Zhejiang military officer to allow those holding certificates from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to board cargo ships and to request the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to issue account collection certificates. Also recorded below is the telegram sent by various industries in this city to the Zhejiang military officer: "With the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, Shanghai merchants urgently need to send personnel to collect funds released to Ningbo. The fact that Shanghai-Ningbo cargo ships do not sell passenger tickets is extremely inconvenient. We propose that any legitimate merchant holding a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce be allowed to board cargo ships to travel between Shanghai and Ningbo. We earnestly request an electronic reply."

### Copper Auxiliary Currency Notes - Issued Immediately - Issuance of Two-Fen Notes - Followed by One-Fen Notes

It is heard that the authorities, recognizing the significant need for copper auxiliary currency and its daily indispensability in the market, will issue copper auxiliary currency notes for general use immediately, starting with two-fen notes. The one-fen notes will also be circulated in the market in the near future. Furthermore, the Shanghai Postal Administration specifically issued an announcement yesterday stating: "It has been found that there is an extreme shortage of copper auxiliary currency in the market recently, making it difficult to give change. For the public purchasing stamps with a fraction less than ten fen, please prepare the exact amount of copper coins in advance. Otherwise, this bureau can only give change in stamps of the same value. This is hereby announced."

### Italian Ambassador to China - Departs Shanghai Soon - For Summer Retreat in Beidaihe

Italian Ambassador to China, Mr. Mancia, has been stationed in China for several months since his appointment but has yet to present his credentials to the Chinese government in Chongqing, only staying in Shanghai. It is now learned that the Italian ambassador will be departing Shanghai soon for a summer retreat in Beidaihe, taking a summer vacation.

### British Warship HMS Cornflower - Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports: The British warship HMS Cornflower, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Murray, the new commander of the British Fifth Cruiser Squadron, is sailing from Gulangyu and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Monday to replace HMS Duncan, the lead ship of the British Twenty-First Destroyer Flotilla.

### French Military Commander - Leaves Shanghai for the North

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports: Colonel Casséville, the commander of the French forces in China, came to Shanghai from the French military headquarters in Tianjin for inspection and left Shanghai this morning (the 10th). The French Consul-General, Baudez, and others went to the Bund in the French Concession to see him off.

The French-language newspaper of the 10th reports: It is heard that Colonel Gasvinna, the commander of the French army in China, will take a ship north today (the 10th) to go to North China. Therefore, at 9:15 this morning, a team of colonial infantry from the French garrison in Shanghai went to the Bund to see him off with full honors. It is also heard that Colonel Gasvinna and his wife held a tea party at the French Merchants' Ball Association yesterday to bid farewell to their friends in Shanghai.

### Martial Law in Beixinjing - Reason for Martial Law - Japanese Troops Ambushed - Leading Unit Annihilated

Martial law has been imposed in Beixinjing, northwest of Shanghai, and land and water transportation has been cut off. A few days ago, a Westerner who came from western Shanghai saw a large number of Japanese troops advancing rapidly westward. Soon after, he heard intense gunfire, knowing that they were clashing with guerrillas. The true situation has now been ascertained as follows: Since Zhao Jiayou, the company commander of the directly subordinate infantry company of the Shanghai People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps, and his deputy, Jiang Shihua, led their troops to garrison west of Beixinjing, northwest of Shanghai, it has been over a year. Zhao has worked hard to strengthen his forces, controlling towns such as Huacao and Zhuzhai. In the past year, he has clashed with the Japanese army no fewer than a dozen times, attracting the attention of the Japanese side, which has offered a reward for his capture. However, Zhao is elusive and attacks them from time to time. The Japanese army hates him to the core. On the 4th of this month, the Japanese troops garrisoning Beixinjing received a report that Zhao's company was using a certain place as a base and intended to attack. However, considering that the forces in Beixinjing were weak, they dispatched a large unit of over a hundred Japanese soldiers from the Lincoln Road headquarters, carrying light and heavy machine guns, small steel cannons, and other weapons, departing from Beixinjing at dawn and advancing rapidly westward in the hope of surrounding Huacao Town. Unexpectedly, Zhao's company had received intelligence in advance, and without making a sound, they first dispersed their troops. When the Japanese troops reached Taohong, their leading unit of over forty men had already passed through the village, and the rear unit was following closely. Suddenly, machine guns and rifles opened fire fiercely, with bullets raining down. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and hastily returned fire, but the front and rear units had been cut off by Zhao's company, resulting in poor coordination. Zhao's company was also familiar with the terrain and had a large number of men. The Japanese troops were at a disadvantage. The two sides fought fiercely for three hours. Many Japanese soldiers in the leading unit were killed, with few survivors. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the rear unit scurried back. By the time reinforcements arrived from Lincoln Road, they had already disappeared like a crane that had flown away. The Japanese army, having suffered a heavy blow, was frustrated and resentful, and vented their anger on the nearby civilians. All villages near Beixinjing were searched, but nothing was found. Meanwhile, martial law was temporarily imposed, cutting off land and water transportation. The intense gunfire heard by the Westerner was from this battle.

### Industries Related to Foreign Exchange - Consider Increasing Prices - Hardware Up 30%, Parts Up 20% - Paper, Kerosene, and Pigments Also Increase in Price

Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange sales, various industries dealing in imported goods have successively increased their selling prices to maintain their capital. The Shanghai Hardware Industry Association specifically convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, with over fifty businesses attending, including Hengda Xiang, Xinshun Tai, Zheng Ji, Yongchang, Changchang, Xingheng, Jiutai, Shen Ji, etc. Zhang Lianfang was elected as chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussions were held. Everyone agreed that the industry's goods were closely related to foreign exchange fluctuations. Given the current selling price of exchange rates, prices should be increased uniformly by 30%. It was also agreed that goods such as pipes, copper, and iron were particularly sought after. However, if foreign exchange shrinks further, the prices of all major hardware goods will still need to increase, among other important matters. The Hardware Parts Industry Association also convened an evaluation committee meeting at its clubhouse in the Coal Industry Building on Tianjin Road at 2:00 PM yesterday, with all members attending. Chairman Wang Yuanzhang reported that the sudden shrinking of foreign exchange recently has increased the cost of hardware such as hinges and door locks that the industry's members had already ordered from Europe and the United States. In order to maintain the capital of the industry's members, selling prices must be increased immediately. After discussion, it was resolved that the prices of all kinds of hinges, metal door locks, etc., would be increased by 20% starting today. As for industries related to foreign exchange, such as paper, kerosene, and pigments, all have increased in price, so the cost of living for citizens is increasing again.

### Export of Goods Purchased with Foreign Exchange - Transit Taxes Exempted - Ministry of Finance Specifies Three Methods for Exemption to Facilitate Export of Domestic Products

In order to facilitate the export of goods purchased with foreign exchange, the National Government's Ministry of Finance has issued three methods for exempting transit taxes, ordering all customs offices to comply. At the same time, the Zhejiang Customs announced that cotton parcels transported from occupied areas to the interior must be notified to the local consolidated tax authorities to levy consolidated taxes. The details are recorded separately below:

Tax Exemption Methods for Exported Goods

The Ministry of Finance instructs all customs offices: "The exemption of export taxes on goods transported abroad purchased with foreign exchange has been implemented since January 1st of this year. In order to facilitate the transit and export of goods purchased with foreign exchange, the following three methods for exempting transit taxes are specifically stipulated: 1. The merchant pays a full amount of deposit and is allowed to proceed. Within a one-year period, the deposit will be returned upon verification of the foreign exchange purchase certificate or cultivation and transportation permit. If the deadline is exceeded, the deposit will be credited to the customs account. 2. The merchant obtains a guarantee from any one of the four banks (Central, China, Communications, Agricultural) or another bank recognized by the customs and deposits it with the customs as a guarantee. If the tax is not paid within one year, the tax will be cleared. 3. When the merchant begins purchasing goods, they consult with the Trade Commission to determine the method of transshipment and storage. The Commission issues a certificate to the customs, listing the type and quantity of goods, the estimated value, and the name and address of the owner, guaranteeing that the goods will be exported within one year. If the goods are not exported after the deadline, the owner shall pay the transit tax according to regulations, or the Trade Commission shall be responsible for payment. Merchants are allowed to choose any of the above methods to proceed. These methods will be implemented from the date of receipt of the telegram. In addition to telegraphing the Director-General of Customs and the Trade Commission separately, a special telegram is sent for compliance and public announcement."

Consolidated Tax on Cotton Parcels

Announcement by the Superintendent and Commissioner of Customs of the Zhejiang Customs: "According to a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, in the future, cotton yarn, directly woven finished products, and processed manufactured goods transported from occupied areas to the interior must be notified by the customs office at the point of arrival to the local consolidated tax authorities to pay consolidated taxes to prevent leakage and maintain tax revenue. Upon receipt of this, we shall comply. In the future, even if the above parcels have completed the customs transit tax, they must still present a verified consolidated tax receipt before they can be released. This is hereby announced for public knowledge."

Refund of Transit Tax for Foreign Exchange Goods

For all merchants whose foreign exchange goods, which are categorized into thirteen types and for which transit taxes have been paid within the past year, are exported after New Year's Day of this year, or are currently being prepared for export, they must submit the original transit tax receipt for verification and registration within three months. After receiving notification that the goods have been shipped abroad, the original tax-collecting customs office will verify the registered transit tax receipt and the foreign exchange settlement documents or Type A transportation permit and verify and refund the original transit tax paid. However, this is limited to goods that are transshipped to the second port and then re-exported in their original packaging or repackaged in accordance with regulations within one year. Please comply accordingly.

Consolidated Tax on Cotton Parcels

In the future, cotton yarn, directly woven finished products, and processed manufactured goods transported from occupied areas to the interior must be notified by the customs office at the point of arrival to the local consolidated tax authorities to pay consolidated taxes to prevent leakage and maintain tax revenue.

### Foreign Exchange Market Stabilizes - No Change in Major Exchange Rates - Excitement of the Past Few Days Disappears - Yesterday's Japanese Yen Rate Lower Than Legal Tender

(Special dispatch from our newspaper in Chongqing on the 10th) A reporter, concerned about the recent fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, specifically inquired with the Ministry of Finance. The spokesperson of the Ministry responded as follows: 1. Maintaining legal tender is the established policy of the Chinese government. The methods used by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee for adjusting foreign exchange rates recently have neither changed the government's policy nor were they measures approved by the government. 2. Due to seasonal import and export relations, imports have increased recently, especially the import of non-essential goods. Therefore, adjusting foreign exchange rates to conform to standards that are beneficial to our economy and maintaining the balance of international payments can better consolidate the foreign exchange market. 3. The government's maintenance of the legal tender's legal exchange rate has never changed before or after the war. Since the management of foreign exchange began, the Central Bank has sold foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate to public and private institutions that have legitimate needs and have been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The facts are clear. As for the difference between the market price and the legal price, this phenomenon is not unique to our country since foreign exchange is being managed. 4. The government has repeatedly instructed banks to maintain stability in order to reduce market fluctuations, and the results have been quite good. Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee, the management mechanism has become more complete, and its strength in maintaining stability is expected to increase. 5. The government is now working harder to reduce the import of non-essential goods and is taking various measures to encourage exports, while saving on the use of foreign exchange, in the hope of benefiting China's economy and adapting to the needs of the war. The strength of the Stabilization Fund Management Committee is also sufficient to stabilize the market. I am deeply confident that everyone's confidence in the legal tender will increase further and will not be affected by the current market fluctuations.

(Special dispatch from our newspaper in Hong Kong on the 10th) The price of legal tender has stabilized. According to those in charge, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund has not felt any pressure in the past few weeks, and the credit of the national currency has not been shaken. This is generally acknowledged. However, the Stabilization Fund Committee temporarily stopped maintaining the exchange rate on Wednesday, allowing the foreign exchange price against the U.S. dollar to reach a better economic level so that foreign trade could be balanced. It is recalled that a similar approach was adopted in June 1938, and this price was maintained for twelve months without change until it reached a level of eight and one-quarter pence. It is believed that the new level has now been achieved and can be firmly maintained. Many items that were previously imported can now be manufactured domestically. According to reports, the expected bumper harvest this year will help to reduce imports. The method for the government to purchase foreign exchange needed for military supplies and other items has been decided and will not affect the foreign exchange market. Finally, the efforts to thoroughly expand the base of this fund have been successful. The government's strength in maintaining foreign exchange is undoubtedly not a problem. Although there is currently a change in the exchange rate level, the national currency continues to gain the public's trust, as free foreign exchange transactions are constantly guaranteed, and so on.

Major Exchange Rates Unchanged Yesterday

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports: "This morning (the 10th), the exchange market in this city was calm. Major exchange rates were essentially unchanged from yesterday (the 9th). The excitement of the past few days has disappeared. Businesses are adjusting themselves to respond to the new situation, but foreign exchange purchased at the new exchange rate level is still limited to a narrow range. There is no hope that imports into Shanghai will decrease immediately. A large number of various imported goods have been ordered from overseas in the past few months. Most merchants have pre-purchased foreign exchange at the previous exchange rate to pay for these imports, with cotton being a prime example. Currently, the raw cotton ordered for Shanghai yarn mills can meet their needs until the end of next month. The foreign exchange has also been settled. Therefore, the large shipments of raw cotton coming from India and the United States in the next six weeks will be at an exchange rate of eight and five pence."

Japanese Yen Rate Lower Than Legal Tender

Rumors that bank personnel in this city have been handling the foreign exchange situation irregularly in the past three days have not subsided. However, in fact, these rumors seem to be unfounded. No one in Shanghai knew about the actions of the Hong Kong fund in advance. Some banks have suffered losses because they have over-sold. In the foreign exchange market here this morning, the Japanese yen rate was again lower than the legal tender. Exchange shops bought Japanese yen at 99.2 fen and sold it at 99.75 fen. Earlier this morning, the Japanese yen exchange rate was bought at 1 yuan and 1 fen of legal tender and sold at 1 yuan and 2 fen. Ten-ounce gold bars reached a new high price again this morning, totaling 2,466 yuan.

HSBC Supplies Black Market to Stabilize - HSBC and other banks are still responsible for supplying the foreign exchange needed by legitimate merchants as much as possible, but they must rely on the order forms of each bank. Since the implementation, speculators have been unable to manipulate the foreign exchange market, and the Japanese plan to speculate in foreign exchange has failed. At the same time, China's trade deficit can also be reduced. The chaotic state of the Shanghai black market has disappeared, and foreign exchange prices are stabilizing. The exchange rates announced by HSBC yesterday were six and a half pence for the British pound and 12.625 yuan for the U.S. dollar, the same as on the 8th and 9th.

The Equalization Committee Exerts Efforts to Maintain Stability - The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee has decided to continue its efforts to maintain the foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market. The restriction of foreign exchange supply by HSBC and other banks may have been instructed by the committee. The committee will resume the supply of foreign exchange when the black market foreign exchange reaches the level line. As for the level line exchange rate, it is unknown to outsiders. According to the observation of a foreign exchange expert, the rumor that the Ministry of Finance will announce the level line exchange rate is definitely not true. The exchange rate of foreign exchange in the black market will not fall any further.

China's Financial Gains are Significant - A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that although merchants in various industries may have suffered losses due to the tightening of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, this measure is very beneficial to China's entire financial system. In the past, Japanese goods accounted for the largest share of imports into China. From January to April of this year, they were valued at 98,538,000 yuan in national currency. After selling the goods, Japanese merchants obtained legal tender and speculated in foreign exchange on the black market, resulting in a huge leak of China's foreign exchange. In the future, the Japanese side will no longer be able to speculate.

Japanese Merchants Order Cotton in China - Japanese yarn mills in China export a large amount of Chinese cotton to Japan, providing sufficient raw materials for industry and munitions. For example, last year's exports were valued at 11 million yuan in national currency. At the same time, they ordered foreign cotton from India and other places to be transported to China for Japanese yarn mills to spin fine yarn. From January to April of this year, cotton imports were valued at 38,870,000 yuan in national currency. The foreign exchange for these cotton imports was all speculated in the Shanghai black market. However, the import of foreign cotton into China will inevitably be affected by the tightening of foreign exchange in the future.

Hong Kong Sends Large Sums to Stabilize Market - According to a reporter from the New News Agency, HSBC continued to be responsible for maintaining the supply of legitimate needs in recent days. At the same time, Hong Kong sent a large amount of foreign exchange to Shanghai yesterday to stabilize the market. Therefore, although one party used various methods to engage in activities, attempting to absorb and disrupt the foreign exchange market, the truth about the new measures of the Equalization Committee has become clear, and people's hearts have stabilized. Therefore, the foreign exchange market has stabilized.

Japanese Side Desperately Attempts to Grab Foreign Exchange - The Continental News reports: "The Shanghai foreign exchange market was mostly inactive throughout the day yesterday (the 9th), but it appeared quite stable at the close last night. Brokers from the Yokohama Specie Bank desperately tried to grab as much foreign exchange as they could get. The bank received orders to purchase over 600,000 U.S. dollars of foreign exchange last night. However, according to reliable sources, many of these orders were not fulfilled and seem likely to be shelved for a long time." Some well-informed brokerage sources admitted that the Japanese side had indeed managed to obtain some foreign exchange yesterday to pay for cotton, but a large amount of foreign exchange is needed to pay for Indian cotton scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this month and in mid-July, and the total amount of foreign exchange obtained yesterday was very small and insufficient to meet the needs.

Japanese Yarn Mills Purchase Large Amounts of Indian Cotton - In view of the current labor situation in the country, it has been decided to manufacture most of the Japanese cloth in China. In accordance with this policy, Japanese yarn mill owners have used foreign exchange obtained in Shanghai in recent months to purchase raw cotton and increase their reserves. This has been learned from a survey of the financial and commodity markets in this city. Japanese yarn mill owners ordered large amounts of Indian cotton in April and May, scheduled for delivery in June and July. Most of it is scheduled for delivery in Shanghai, and some has already been shipped to Japan. However, whether it is shipped to Japan or Shanghai, the foreign exchange necessary for the yarn mill owners to pay for the goods is mostly dependent on Shanghai.

Contracts Will Be Terminated in the Future - It was reliably claimed by financial circles yesterday that the Sino-British Equalization Fund Management Office's move to not support the old exchange rate has had the effect of curbing the large-scale import of Japanese cotton goods into Shanghai. Although it is difficult to completely block these imports, it is believed that they will be greatly reduced. Unless the Japanese side can obtain the foreign exchange necessary to pay for cotton in Shanghai or elsewhere, they may be forced to terminate some contracts.

Cotton Orders Valued at Tens of Millions of Pounds - A reporter asked brokers about the Japanese purchase of cotton yesterday. Most of them said they knew little about the cotton prices, but made various estimates. It is estimated that the cotton purchased by Japanese yarn mill owners in Shanghai and Japan, scheduled for delivery in the next three months, totals as much as 25 million pounds. This figure cannot be considered reliable, but it is certain that Japanese cotton orders have reached tens of millions of pounds.

Japanese Plans Shattered - Shanghai is a source of foreign exchange, no different from a small gold mine for Japan. Until Wednesday morning, when the Hong Kong Administration stopped supporting the market, Japanese yarn mill owners, unable to obtain the necessary foreign exchange in the country, felt that this city was a bright spot, albeit a dim one in appearance. The Japanese side sold cheap Japanese yen in the local market and found its sales among travelers, tourists, and speculators. The legal tender they received was all converted into foreign exchange. This foreign exchange was mostly used by Japanese merchants to pay for imported goods, and it is heard that some of the foreign exchange was transferred to the Japanese military, but its main purpose was to purchase raw materials to supply Japanese industry. Today, the Japanese purchase of large amounts of foreign exchange has been curbed, at least temporarily. Everyone agrees that if the financial situation remains unchanged as it is today, Japanese banks will still be able to obtain some foreign exchange, but its amount is likely to be insufficient to meet the import of raw materials necessary for the expansion plans of Japanese industrialists here.

Shanghai People Buy Little Foreign Exchange - Only the Japanese attempt to purchase foreign currency was the feature of the Shanghai foreign exchange market yesterday. Chinese and foreign merchants and importers did not attempt to purchase foreign exchange yesterday, after rushing to purchase it on Wednesday afternoon and the day before. As a result, exchange rates were quite stable yesterday morning. Some smaller banks that still had foreign exchange on hand sold it at an exchange rate slightly lower than that quoted by HSBC. One hundred U.S. dollars cost nearly 800 yuan of legal tender. Except for the Japanese side, it was rare to see Shanghai people buying foreign currency at this high price.

Ministry of Finance Explains Foreign Exchange Situation - Reuters, Chongqing, 10th - The Ministry of Finance issued a statement today regarding the foreign exchange situation, stating that the established policy of the Chinese government is to maintain a monetary system suitable for the national economy and the basis for legitimate trade. This policy is not changed by the actions of the Equalization Fund Committee in temporarily not supporting the foreign exchange market. The actions of the committee are naturally approved by the government. The lack of balance in China's payment difference has gradually been discovered. Imports have greatly increased recently, mostly non-essential. The adjustment of exchange rates can help to correct this and create a more stable situation.

### British Police Officers Reluctant to Learn Japanese; Municipal Council Stipulates Japanese Language Allowance, British Officers Too Busy, Remain Indifferent to the Matter

The Continental Daily News reports that the Municipal Council provides cash to British and other foreign officers in the police force who study Japanese. This news was disclosed in a circular issued by the General Headquarters of the Police yesterday evening (9th) to all police stations in the Public Concession. The circular only stated that the Municipal Council has approved the issuance of

cash allowances to foreign First Group personnel in the police force who wish to learn Japanese, ranging from 250 to 500 yuan (Shanghai currency). This will be paid upon completion of the elementary and advanced courses, provided they pass the stipulated examinations to qualify for the allowance. Yesterday evening, the reporter asked several British police officers if they would take the opportunity to receive this 500 yuan. Their

answers were all the same: They are too busy dealing with the current crime situation in Shanghai and have no time to dedicate to learning Japanese. Moreover, the 500 yuan allowance is not enough to induce them to spend several months learning to speak Japanese.

### Puppet Regime Controls Cocoon Production, Imposes Special Dry Cocoon Tax, Already Collected in Wuxi, Silk Farmers Lament Bitterly

The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, due to their suitable climates, have always been extremely abundant in silk production, accounting for more than two-thirds of the country's total, holding an important position in foreign trade. Starting in 1932, the National Government's Ministry of Industry actively engaged in improving and distributing improved breeds to develop silk production, and established training institutes for sericulture personnel. Production saw historical increases, reaching more than 3.5 million sheets annually, exporting more than 1 million bales of raw silk, breaking previous records. Since the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, all silk-producing areas have suffered severe devastation. Subsequently, the Japanese puppet regime, in order to seize economic interests, organized the "Central China Silk Company" to force the purchase of silkworm eggs from the people at low prices. All cocoons were seized, and the "company" made a profit of more than 2 million yuan last year. This year, the "Central China Company" has made demands on various mulberry farms, requiring each farm to dispatch a Japanese manager to manage all silkworm eggs stationed on the farm, which would be distributed by the "company" without duplication or transfer, attempting to further monopolize and manipulate. However, the farm owners firmly refused and resisted justly, so this plan has not yet been fully realized.

Guarantee Deposit Required for Purchasing Spring Cocoons

This year, the spring cocoons in Wuxi, Yixing, Changzhou in Jiangsu Province, and Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Yuhang, Haining, etc. in Zhejiang Province have been successively launched on the market. The puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department" did not succeed in implementing control last year, so this year it decided to abandon control in Zhejiang Province, but still implement it in Jiangsu Province, stipulating that those who wish to purchase spring cocoons must register in advance and pay a guarantee deposit of three yuan per market dan for dry cocoons, calculated at fifteen market dan per single stove. Silk factories in the city are reluctantly purchasing to maintain operations due to raw materials, but the quantity has been greatly reduced compared to before.

Puppet Finance Department Levies Special Dry Cocoon Tax

The puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Government Finance Department" has formulated regulations for the collection of "business tax" on all industries, calculated according to business income and capital. Recently, in view of the spring cocoons being launched on the market, in order to scrape together money, it has also formulated a special business tax for dry cocoons, and has set up a bureau in Wuxi, where silk is concentrated. It has also sent personnel to set up "offices" in counties with relatively abundant silk production to collect the tax. Ordinary silk farmers are burdened by this harsh tax and are lamenting bitterly.

### Jiangsu Province Maintains Food Supply and Military Provisions, Strictly Prohibits Smuggling of Grain to Supply Japanese, Stipulates that Food Grain Can Only Circulate Within the County, Inter-County Assistance Must Be Approved

The Jiangsu Provincial Government has repeatedly issued orders to investigate and prohibit the supply of food grain to the Japanese in order to maintain food supply and military provisions for the people. Now, in view of the fact that many counties are still smuggling for profit, resulting in daily increases in rice and wheat prices, special revised investigation and protection measures have been issued to all counties for compliance, stipulating that in the future, food grains such as rice and wheat can only circulate within the county.

Prohibition of Exporting from the County

All civil servants, self-government personnel, and team officers and soldiers should strengthen the protection of rice and wheat within the county. If there are any cases of obstruction, extortion, or corruption, the county magistrate should investigate and deal with them severely. If there is a real need for mutual assistance between counties, the person applying for assistance should state the facts of the need for assistance, as well as the type and quantity, location of assistance, and the name and address of the purchaser, and submit it to the county magistrate in charge for responsible review and confirmation, and then consult with the neighboring county.

Joint Submission to the Provincial Government for Approval

Then the county will fill out a purchase and transportation certificate, purchase from the neighboring county, and exchange it for a transportation certificate before it can be transported to the assistance location. Those who use public office for private gain, attempt to supply the Japanese, or confuse and profit will, once discovered or reported, in addition to severely punishing the applicant for purchase and transportation in accordance with the law, the county magistrate in charge should also be severely punished to clarify important responsibilities.

### Russian Empress, A Ship, Passes Japan to Come to Shanghai, Scheduled to Arrive Tomorrow, Head South to Hong Kong on the 13th

The steamship "Russian Empress" of the British firm Chang Hing Shipping Company, departed from Vancouver, California, via Japan, to Shanghai, heading to Hong Kong and Little Luzon.

After receiving the letter, Gu Shen felt very strange, because Zhu Fenghang had embezzled the above

two amounts of legal tender, totaling

890 yuan, and hid without showing his face. He dared to write a letter notifying and deceiving, and still wanted to take back his bedding and clothing boxes.

arrest Zhu and transfer him to the Gordon Road Police Station for detention. He was then escorted to the Criminal Division III of the First Special District Court.

### Pan Qiahe and Others Are Blinded by Greed, Selling Fake Travel Permits, Countless Travelers Deceived, Eleven Defendants Detained Awaiting Sentencing

Pan Qiahe from Nanjing, seeing that Chinese people frequently entered and exited the occupied areas and that travel permits were in great demand, conspired to organize the Wanguo Commercial Company in Room 78, No. 266 Beijing Road, and served as the director of general affairs. On the other hand, his accomplice Weng Da rented rooms in Zhiyuan, Santai, Wuxi and other hotels to establish a Hezhong Company, which communicated with Wanguo.

Colluding with Each Other

They specialized in selling fake travel permits and epidemic prevention certificates issued by the Japanese army to merchants traveling to and from various occupied towns, defrauding money for profit and squandering it, while those who carried these certificates did not know that they were counterfeit. They still regarded them as amulets, and were embarrassed by the Japanese troops stationed along the way. Over the months, countless people lost money. Recently, a person surnamed Sang reported to the General Patrol Room, and detectives Kang Zengxiang and Peng Bingsheng, together with Western detectives, successively arrested Pan Qiahe, Weng Da and other eleven people, and confiscated

Forged Documents

and books, and were handed over to the First Special District Court and ordered to be detained for investigation. The case has now been thoroughly investigated by the investigating detectives. According to Pan's confession in the police station, Wanguo Company was established in February of this year, and the number of travel permits sold was about 100, all of which were sent by Qian Yong, an apprentice of Hezhong Company in the Wuxi Hotel. There were three types of certificates, with different periods, so the prices were also divided into two yuan, four yuan, six yuan, etc. Yuan Youru was a running-street hired by Wanguo, etc. Although Yuan Wu admitted to participating in the sale of fake certificates, he had been certified by the deceived people to the police station that Yuan had filled out application forms for them.

Qian Yong Confesses

He repeatedly sent certificates and took photos to Wanguo at the behest of his master, Weng Da. Although Weng Da admitted that he had established Hezhong Company in Santai Hotels in Wuxi, he said that the fake travel permits were purchased from Ni Rongfa, who asked his younger brother Ni Zhenji to send them. A total of 180 were purchased. In addition to selling 100 copies to Wanguo, he sold the rest himself. Ni Zhenji also admitted to sending the certificate to Weng at his brother's order, but Ni Rongfa had fled without a trace when the case occurred.

By 11:55 AM, the buying interest from the northern firms turned weak, and the gold firms supplied more vigorously, immediately falling back down, selling 50 taels each to the silver shops and money exchange businesses at a price of 75 yuan. Later, it was reduced by 9 yuan. At 12:04 PM, a money exchange business sold 50 taels to a securities firm, with 66 yuan as the afternoon closing price. In the afternoon, the first gold firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange business at a price of 65 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business suddenly came to buy again, with the potential to rise, buying 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 68 yuan. Instantly, under the cover of buying, the price was raised again by 7 yuan. Securities firms bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 75 yuan. After the northern firms and money exchange businesses stopped buying, the price fell again. A certain silver shop forcibly sold 150 taels, all absorbed by the money exchange businesses, with the price falling to 2,467 yuan at closing. As a result, it rose another 27 yuan compared to the previous day. It has already risen rapidly for five days, totaling 373 yuan. The whole day rose and fell 25 yuan.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed rates were announced, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 1.125, the Dutch exchange rate down 1.125, and the rest remained at the original prices. In the unofficial market, because various rumors in the market had gradually dissipated, and all parties were clear about the truth about the restrictions on the supply of foreign exchange, and the HSBC Bank was willing to maintain the supply of large amounts of settlements for legitimate commercial import trading firms at the listed rate, and Hong Kong Telegraph also sold non-stop, people's hearts gradually stabilized, and the market gradually entered the right track. In half a day, the British exchange rate was only 0.0625, and the US exchange rate was only 0.125 away. After the morning, due to the large number of settlements in the trading firms, and a certain broker suddenly bought up on behalf of a Japanese bank, the situation was once tight. Later, although the Western firm Sassoon bought up, because the selling was very profitable, and Hong Kong Telegraph and foreign firms competed to sell, so it returned to flat. The transaction was still strong in half a day. Because the Hong Kong exchange rate was sold by Chinese and foreign banks, the situation was slightly harder.

Exchange Rate Returns to Flat after Tightening

At the beginning of the morning, because the London large items were down 0.0625, the New York silver price was fixed, the London raw gold was not history, the exchange rate of British to US was 0.90, the exchange rate to Shanghai fell 0.125, the exchange rate to France remained flat, the exchange rate of US to British was down 0.125, the exchange rate to Shanghai fell 0.25, and the exchange rate to France was 0.0625.

After opening, a certain broker first bought up spot British gold at 6 pence 0.5 for the Japanese bank, and also spot US exchange rate was only 12.625 yuan, and the trading firms also absorbed HSBC's spot British gold at 6 pence and a half, causing the potential to soften. HSBC's listed rates were announced, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 1.125, the Dutch exchange rate down 1.125, and the rest remained at the original prices. The white silver balance tax was revealed to be a small fraction, totaling 4.00%. After this, profitable sellers suddenly sold spot British gold at 6 pence 0.3125 to Chinese banks, and Hong Kong Telegraph also sold spot British gold to Sassoon at 6 pence 0.53125. Later, a Japanese trading firm also sold spot US exchange rate to Zhengjin Bank at 12.8125 yuan, and a certain bank also sold spot US exchange rate to trading firms at 12.625 and 75 yuan, so the situation returned to flat. Near noon, there were only Hong Kong exchange rate transactions, with Chinese firms Guangdong and foreign firms Holland successively selling spot prices to money exchange businesses at 45.75 yuan, and the market was slightly harder. Extending to the noon closing, the banks' spot selling prices were: British exchange rate 6 pence 0.5625, and US exchange rate 12.75 yuan, which were not up or down from the morning opening. As a result, compared to last night's closing, the British and US exchange rates were neither glorious nor shameful, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was 0.75 harder than the transaction price. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday. Here are the opening transactions recorded in half a day.

### Gold Pound Rises Again - Exchange Market Stabilizes, Gold Notes Loosen, Japanese Yen Still Difficult to Revitalize

Yesterday, British pure gold did not move, the British and American exchange rates fell by 0.125. The foreign exchange in Shanghai was strong, but the supply of foreign banks tended to be smooth, and many speculators also made profits and supplied. The market was slightly loose, and the British exchange rate closed at 6 pence 0.5625, and the US exchange rate closed at 12.75 yuan. It is thought that this is the level of foreign exchange. The spot market opened, and the gold firms absorbed it enthusiastically. The market continued to be strong, rising 20 yuan compared to the previous day. General speculators took advantage of the surplus and worked hard to lift it, reaching a peak of 2,485 yuan. However, the foreign exchange has stabilized, and those who made profits rushed to sell, and the rising wind suddenly stopped. The afternoon transaction was still strong, and the market trend was rotational. As a result, it rose 27 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were in great demand, and the supply was not smooth, and the market price continued to rise. British and American gold notes, because the foreign exchange was stable, and the supply of those who made profits was strong, the market price loosened. The supply and demand of Hong Kong notes were comparable, and they were quite stable. The French franc notes, Dutch notes, etc. continued to become more expensive to make up for the shortage of the previous two days. The Japanese yen was ultimately difficult to revitalize. The Japanese gold notes once reached 1 yuan and 0.05 centimes, and then fell back to 9.85 cents. The Korean notes were quite stable, and the late closing was 8.45 cents. The association's transactions did not open.

As for the call rate of the Money Industry Association, it suddenly rose by six points, totaling 18 cents. When asked about the industry, it was said that this is a common occurrence on the 5th or 10th of each month.

### Securities. New Methods for Trading Government Bonds. Using One Set of Funds as Two. The Downturn in Foreign Debt Has Subsided

Yesterday's over-the-counter securities market turned firm and stable again. Category C bonds broke through the 30 yuan mark again. At this juncture, buying and selling have occurred countless times. The strength of the bulls is evident. It is understood that large investors can use one set of capital to make several times the transaction, that is, use the inherent capital to buy government bonds, and then transfer the goods received to others for short selling, that is, use the proceeds as collateral, and then use this money to buy government bonds again. The funds for this second purchase are essentially interest-free loans. Buying in this rolling manner, the shorts are appropriately used and get unexpected high profits. The shorts bid up the price to cover, and the longs slightly release. All environmental changes have nothing to do with the government bonds themselves. The government has repeatedly stated that it will maintain the credit of the bonds. With the interest payment period approaching, the bulls are even more fearless. Therefore, the market price has been looking small in recent days, but the result has been a rise. This is the biggest reason. When the market opened yesterday afternoon, Tiansheng, Yu Da, Lianhe, and Jin Yi were keen to buy. Shuntai was exclusively interested in Category B bonds. Although there were sellers such as Nos. 10, 41, 60, and 77, the demand still exceeded supply. The price rose by 20 to 45 cents in the morning. Category E bonds fell slightly due to the ex-drawing calculation. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment was strong again. Yongkang, Runli, and Hengfu all had considerable buying interest. Songmao bought Category E and sold Category C. Yongfeng, Hongda, and No. 20 slightly sold off. The market price rose by another 10 to 20 cents. The future trend is still not easy to underestimate. At the end of the day, except for Category E bonds, which fell by 65 cents due to the ex-drawing factor, the rest all rebounded by 15 to 55 cents. The total turnover was more than 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 62.95 62.30 62.80 Up 0.5

Unified B 54.85 54.40 54.85 Up 0.5

Unified C 52.20 52.70 52.20 Up 0.45

Unified D 52.40 52.20 52.40 Up 0.15

Unified E 52.70 52.20 52.55 Down 0.65

9-Hole 6.50 6.40 6.50 Up 0.20

Stock trading was relatively quiet. At the Chinese Securities Exchange, the seller asked for 29 yuan and 75 cents, but there were no buyers. The stock market of the Public Industry Association was active again, specializing in rubber stocks. The opening price of most stocks was relatively high. Afterwards, the stock price continued to rise. The foreign exchange rate was still fluctuating, trending towards weakening. In addition, the price of rubber raw materials rose day by day, which led to many investors investing in rubber stocks, seemingly to avoid the loss of their assets. Towards the end of the market, prices fell from high to low, but at the close, the market conditions of various items remained good, and were higher than the previous day. The number of accounts increased. The industrial stocks in the market were also very active, and the prices were slightly higher.

The stock market prices of various Far East companies of British merchants in London on the 9th of this month (Friday) fluctuated very little. HSBC Bank shares rose by half a pound each. The share price registered in England was 85 and a half pounds, and the share price registered in Hong Kong was 86 and a half pounds. Kulak-Limpeh Rubber shares fell by six pence, with a price of 18 shillings and 10 and a half pence. There were no other changes.

The downtrend in London's Chinese foreign debt market on the 9th of this month (Friday) gradually ceased. Only the Reorganization Loan British issue bond and the Daoqing and Jinghu Railway bonds continued to fall by one pound. The rest were stable. The new low price of the Reorganization Loan British issue bond was 42 and a half pounds, which had fallen to the lowest record in 1927. The new price of the Daoqing Railway bond was 18 pounds, and the new price of the Jinghu Railway bond was 12 pounds. On the previous day, 2,000 pounds of Reorganization Loan British issue bonds were traded, with an opening price of 43 pounds, down half a pound from yesterday's market.

### Grains. After the Settling of Foreign Rice Prices, the Prices of Japonica and Indica Rice Increased

Yesterday, the sources of Du Japonica rice from various gangs in the lower reaches of the river were still blocked by the inland and had not arrived. Only more than 2,700 packages came from the Che Lun Bao Zi, Tong Kun, and other areas. After the rumors spread the day before yesterday that foreign rice would be subject to foreign exchange restrictions and settlement, people's hearts suddenly turned upward. The market was quite active at the opening in the morning. Then, the hoarders also vigorously pulled in, and the local streets also took action, so the market seemed to have difficulty in meeting the supply. The market then rose sharply. Gao Chang Japonica rice opened at 17 yuan and 80 cents. The remaining Gao Japonica rice all increased by 30 to 40 cents compared to the previous market. The price of goods that were cut through the middle section increased by more than half a yuan. Bo Dao also increased by 30 cents.

Yesterday, hoarders tried their best to search for Ke Indica rice, and the local demand was also active. A total of more than 6,000 packages were opened in the market. The high-priced goods in the market were immediately raised by a large amount of half a yuan. The other prices were higher by 30 to 40 cents. Yesterday's transactions were mostly in medium-grade goods, and two-thirds were hoarded. Du Yang Jian Bu Jian also rose by 30 to 40 cents.

After the fixed price of foreign rice was settled and no longer transported to Shanghai, people's hearts in the market were upward. Now, the retail price in Saigon opened at 19 yuan and 35 cents in the morning, and the price was raised by 10 cents in the afternoon. The hoarders went to six or seven hundred packages in the afternoon, and the price reached 19 yuan and 65 cents.

The sales of glutinous rice were not satisfactory, with only a slight increase. It is currently selling for 20 yuan and 45 cents.

### Yarn and Cotton. The Peak Season for Single Yarn Has Passed. Another Drop of More Than Ten Yuan. Hoarders of 20-Count Yarn Still Do Not Relax

The yarn market's atmosphere has stabilized slightly due to the quietness of the foreign exchange market, and the range of market changes is narrower. However, those who generally absorb and hoard still do not relax, so although the actual sales are sluggish, buyers are still in high spirits.

The current yarn market initially continued the rising trend of the previous day's afternoon, and the buying voices were still noisy. General mobile brokers quickly opened prices, rising by two yuan. 20-count Shuangma warehouse receipts were 462 yuan, and spot goods from foreign warehouses were 472 yuan. The buying sentiment was strong, but the customer sales were still lifeless. As for Guangbang Wanxing, spot goods were sold and warehouse receipts were dropped. Soon after, it was heard that the foreign exchange listing did not change much, and the atmosphere suddenly calmed down. The market declined slowly due to the lack of demand. The spot price of foreign warehouses broke through the 470 yuan mark to 69 yuan. The price of warehouse receipts was still high because many parties held on and did not release. It is said in the market that a certain someone in the exchange and the gold industry gang are in a long position and are looking up. However, there are few hoarders of 32-count single yarn, and the peak season for customer demand has passed. It suddenly fell by 15 yuan, with little fluctuation in the middle. By the closing price, the price of 20-count Shuangma foreign warehouse goods was 468 yuan, the Dou Piao price was 466 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 461 yuan. The market opened slightly in the afternoon to receive goods in the market. It was heard that the closing price of gold was high, and the buying momentum was strong, rising by two yuan. The warehouse receipt price of 20-count Bianma was 460 yuan, and the spot price of foreign warehouses was 474 yuan, but the turnover was not strong. There was some turnover among peers, but customer sales remained stagnant. It was found that a total of 1,735 packages were bought by various gangs throughout the day, with transactions between peers accounting for 1,280 packages. The market price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 4 yuan, Tiannv rose by 3 and a half yuan, Shuangdiqiu rose by 4 and a half yuan, Muyang rose by 1 yuan, and Wufu fell by 1 and a half yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows: Peers 1,280, Shantou 60, Hong Kong 265, Mainland 130, Total 1,735.

The Japanese yarn market started well and then weakened. Actual sales were sluggish. Only the peer-to-peer rubber ball transaction was lively. The price of this month's Yueqin yarn was 398 yuan, then returned to 94 yuan, and 296 yuan in the afternoon.

### Cotton Trading. Only Relying on Peers to Adorn. A Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrived in Port This Morning

The cotton business is still dominated by foreign cotton. 2,050 pieces were traded today. Transactions between peers were still lively. The factory purchased very little. The market price rose sharply. Transactions in Chinese cotton were rare due to the lack of goods. Only Shenxin Factory purchased 120 pieces, which were Chinese packaged India. Peers traded 300 packages of Tonghua cotton. This cotton has a better body and the selling price is also expensive. From Subei, 195 packages of Xiasha cotton arrived in Tongzhou, and 70 packages of cotton were transported to Hong Kong. The current situation of cotton is recorded on the left.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was relatively quiet today. The opening was due to poor weather reports in the cotton area. Cotton pests were very active in the Mississippi area. The Southern spot cotton market was also firm. It is rumored in Washington that the cotton export subsidy issue will be discussed again in the recent parliament. Therefore, peers are temporarily watching and waiting. As a result, the near term fell by one pound, and the far term rose slightly by four or five pounds. Due to the sharp contraction in the Shanghai exchange rate, India's cotton exports to the Far East were greatly affected. Because the market was sluggish, yesterday, including forecasts, it fell by three rupees. Egypt fell by more than ten pounds.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Due to the chaotic exchange rate, small factories, due to insufficient inventory, were quite panicked about raw materials, and have been painfully purchasing at high prices for days, suffering not a little. The goods in the hands of peers in the market have been almost completely bought up, so it has turned quiet since yesterday. Other factories have strong reserves, and the goods ordered previously are all on the way separately, and the raw materials are sufficient for four months. The price of foreign cotton is not calculated temporarily due to the chaotic exchange rate.

This year's foreign cotton imports are said to be more than in previous years. Except for those transported to Shanghai by Japanese ships and those transferred to Japan, the details are unknown. Those transported by foreign ships are extremely large, and have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the British Company's RawaIpindi, coming from London via Mumbai, India, loaded 1,196 pieces of cotton there, which can be imported at 11:00 this morning, and it is scheduled to dock at buoys 12 and 13 for transfer. In addition, the Tilawa of the company managed by Duck Company, transported 8,300 pieces of cotton from Kolkata, which can arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 this morning, and it will dock at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

### The Change in the Exchange Rate Stabilization. By Sheng Mujie

Since the establishment of a 10 million pound legal currency foreign exchange stabilization fund by China and the United Kingdom in early March, the Shanghai over-the-counter market's British gold has finally stood at eight pence and 25, and the US dollar has always stood at 16 yuan and 0625, until June 6. The Shanghai foreign exchange over-the-counter market was almost completely calm for three months. However, starting in July, the Sino-British Stabilization Fund Committee telegraphed HSBC and McCall, two banks in Shanghai from Hong Kong, and suddenly decided to suspend the sale of all foreign exchange to legal currency. The foreign exchange market was naturally shrouded in an atmosphere of panic, and other markets were also greatly shaken. Therefore, I will discuss the reasons for this sudden change in the stabilization policy and its future trends within the scope of my humble opinion.

#### The Establishment of the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund

To talk about the establishment of the Stabilization Fund, you must first know the market conditions before its establishment. Needless to say about last year, let's take this year as an example. Since January, the exchange rate has tended to shrink from the market price of eight and a half pence for British gold and sixteen and a half yuan for the US dollar, but both supply and demand can still adapt. Entering February, the trend became tighter, and the buyers in the market took the advantage. Since the emergence of the over-the-counter market in Shanghai, Hong Kong, which has been in the position of seller, has always been regarded as the supporter of the over-the-counter foreign exchange in the Shanghai market. However, the number of sales this year is far less than before, and the method of supply has also changed. In the past, there was no price limit, but suddenly there was a range. The market felt that the support from Hong Kong was not as strong as before. Since the supply and demand in the market cannot adapt, the exchange rate will naturally fall slowly. After February 15, the exchange rate had a sharp downward trend. Fortunately, HSBC Bank came out to be in the position of seller, supplying foreign exchange at eight pence and 125, and the market situation was stabilized. Looking at the high and low market prices of each Saturday from January 7 to March 4, you can know. But what kind of people are the buyers?

It is the needs of the commercial sector. Among them, the needs of cotton and wheat are large. Because the North China cotton of Shanghai yarn factories is controlled by Japan, the yarn factories retreat and purchase Indian cotton. The flour factories also have a large amount of wheat imported, and the settlement price must be paid in foreign exchange. Therefore, buyers frequently scour the market for foreign exchange. Due to the circulation of counterfeit currency in Tianjin, the counterfeit organization ordered that legal currency should not be circulated in the north from March 10. Those who hold legal currency made arrangements before this "ban" was implemented, hoping to avoid future difficulties, and they bought foreign exchange with legal currency. They have been active in the market since the end of January. The exchange rate in February was almost entirely under the pressure of the north. Although the buying sentiment in the north was not fierce, when the market price was slightly higher than eight pence and 125, Tianjin took action to absorb it at any time. Japanese merchants also frequently operate in the market, but they do not come forward and mostly entrust expanding customers to absorb. It can be seen that in the over-the-counter market before the establishment of the stabilization fund, buyers were often more than sellers. Then, the power to maintain the minimum price of eight pence and 125 was really stretched. In order to consolidate the foundation of the legal currency, the Chinese government increased the allocation of 10 million pounds of British gold to maintain the credit of the legal currency and stabilize foreign exchange. ——Regarding the Exchange Fund, please refer to my article "The Sino-British Exchange Fund Loan" in the Shenbao on March 11.

### Silk and Tea. Zhejiang Cocoon Outbound Transportation Obstructed. Japanese Cocoon Prices Are Also More Expensive Than in Previous Years. The Silk Market May Rise Again

The cocoon market in Zhejiang Road was caused by the destruction of most of the cocoon firms, resulting in a phenomenon of more cocoons and fewer firms, which promoted the fact that cocoon prices were extraordinarily cheap. The cocoon collection on that line has now been completed, but the transportation problem has not been resolved. The forced inability to transport dry cocoons reaches more than 10 million yuan, most of which are in the guerrilla area and a small part in the occupied area. The pressure from the puppet government has not been able to directly control it. Therefore, the threats and inducements from "Central China" have no great effect. Therefore, it changed its strategy and sent out small and large claws to contact silk factories and cocoon firms individually, so as to implement its policy of breaking through each one. However, many silk factories and cocoon merchants are deeply aware of the great righteousness, and do not want to have the suspicion of cooperating with "Central China" to collect cocoons, and have rejected the conditions of half-buying and paying taxes to pass through and limit the exclusive sale to a certain firm for export. However, some soft-kneed elements have already sold out this interest, but they have been punished by the regular army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Two days ago, 18 cocoon factories in Hushu and other places in the suburbs of Hangzhou were destroyed, and more than 3,000 dan of fresh cocoons were burned, all of which belonged to the actions of those who were alert and willing to cooperate. Therefore, in the future, transporting cocoons may be safest to take a detour through eastern Zhejiang.

This spring, Japan's cocoon raising volume has been reduced by 10%, as reported earlier in this newspaper. However, the amount of cocoon collection is still unable to be estimated due to lack of materials. According to a Yokohama telephone message yesterday, the Tokyo cocoon market is starting business this week. The spot price of fresh cocoons has risen from 66 yen to 70 and a half yen. According to the market price in previous years, it was only around 46 yen, but this spring it has risen by 54%. From this, it can be inferred that the degree of reduction in cocoon production in Tokyo this year. In addition, this year's silk costs in Japan have also increased significantly. Now, based on the cocoon price, the price of white silk 20-22 stripes should be on the 1,140 yen line, and the price of 13-15 stripes should be on the 1,320 yen mark. Therefore, after the cocoon collection in the Tokyo market ends, the trend of the silk market may turn upward again. (Detailed)

Yesterday, foreign firms such as Xiehe, Yihua, Baochang, and Jinlong purchased more than 370 boxes of green tea from this port. The top plate price for Tizhuang Chou Rui Zhenmei opened at 268 yuan. The selling price of ordinary Zhenmei ranged from 205 yuan to 212 yuan. The market price continued to rise firmly by three to four yuan.

### Hardware. Commodity Prices Are Rising. Sales Are Stagnant

Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the asking prices of various hardware products have soared, but the sales volume in various ways has decreased day by day, so the market has become stagnant. The standards are high. The market prices on the 6th and the current market selling prices are listed on the left.

### Sugar Market. The Price of Refined White Sugar Rose by Half a Yuan

According to yesterday's London telegram, the sugar market has eased slightly in the near term by .25. The August price is 6 shillings, 10 pence and .75. The December price rose by .25 to 6 shillings and 1 pence and .25. The March price next year rose by the same amount to 6 shillings and 1 pence and .75. According to the Dutch telegram, 2,000 packages of the original Dutch quality 8.45 were recovered in July and August. Although the Hong Kong telegram showed a small decrease of 50 cents, it was still above the Shanghai market. Therefore, the market price set by the local guild is still firm. The price of refined white sugar has also risen by 50 cents.

### How to Take Exams

— Yang Chunlu

"Exams are a difficult hurdle," every student probably feels this way when they are nearing the end of the semester. Because failing an exam means not being able to advance to the next grade or graduate, which is such a shameful thing!

Children: Your school is about to hold exams, do you find it difficult? Now I will discuss the methods of dealing with exams with the children, which may help you solve some difficulties.

Exams are to measure how much you have learned in ordinary times. Therefore, dealing with exams completely depends on ordinary times, and temporary efforts will not work. Learn well what you learn in ordinary times. Master the Chinese language, practice arithmetic proficiently, and know common sense well. Then, when it comes to exams, just review the lessons you have learned several times to deal with them.

Before the exam, you should also pay attention to the health of your body and mind, and maintain normal eating and living habits. Because excessive effort and too much stimulation of the brain can make the nerves feel tired. By the time the exam comes, memory will weaken and thinking will become slow, which will be detrimental to the exam. Therefore, "not working hard in ordinary times, but burning the midnight oil when things get urgent" is absolutely not allowed.

When taking the exam, be calm and don't panic. Getting anxious often leads to "exam amnesia", and forgetting everything that has been prepared. When answering questions, read the questions carefully. It is best to do the easy questions first and then the difficult questions. If there are doubts and uncertainties, think carefully. Don't be impatient, and don't dwell on one question, leaving the rest of the questions behind. If you really don't know, leave it blank and don't answer randomly. Because non-yes, multiple choice and other test questions, unanswered questions are not counted, and wrong answers will deduct points. After finishing, review it carefully, being careful to avoid omissions or missing words in the questions.

Children! You should understand that studying is for yourself, and exams are to measure studying. Therefore, when you go to take the exam, just do what you know and don't do what you don't know. Never cheat or peek at others, which is a despicable behavior and a self-deceiving trick. Children who recognize the purpose of studying will never want to do this!

### The Death of the Chicks

— Yong

Three weeks ago, Jue'er was really busy, because the old hen in his house hatched twelve eggs, and he had to visit them every day to see if the chicks had hatched. Now, three weeks later, the twelve eggs have turned into twelve fat and small, yellow and smooth chicks, which are really cute. In addition to preparing his homework, Jue'er also had to pay attention to their food, fearing that they would not be able to swallow rough things, so he specially ground the rice finely for them to eat. The old hen also clucked, leading her children to find small bugs to eat.

The chicks grew very quickly under the care of Jue'er and the hen, but they had another bad habit, which was to sneak out to play from time to time. Although the hen ran anxiously, calling loudly, calling her children back, still no trace of them could be seen. The more timid chicks, hearing the hen's repeated warnings, said: "Children, come back quickly! The fierce eagle is circling in the sky, and your little lives cannot be preserved!" So they ran back and hid under the hen's wings. What about the other ones? They didn't want to come back until they were full and had played enough.

Finally, one afternoon, Jue'er found that four chicks were missing. The hen seemed to be calling differently from usual. Jue'er looked everywhere and found scattered, chaotic feathers in a pile of bushes. He picked them up and looked at them carefully. These were exactly the light yellow, soft, fluffy down feathers of the chicks. Alas! The chicks finally died because they didn't listen to the hen.

Children, are you obedient good children? Can you follow the teachings of your parents and teachers? Although our disobedience does not lead to the loss of life like the chicks, but at a time when bacteria are breeding in the summer, for example, parents and teachers say that things outside cannot be bought to eat, but because of temporary greed, you buy dirty things to eat without telling them, and unfortunately get sick, isn't your life also in danger at that time? Therefore, if we want to be good children, we must develop this good habit of listening, because the words of parents and teachers will not make us be fooled.

### Investigation

— Bai Zheng

—Memoirs of Escape: Number Twenty-Four—

Having exhausted every ounce of strength, we barely made it through the treacherous rapids of Yama's Shoal. The Jiangshan boat, as if completely drained, rested quietly for the night by the bank of an unknown small town. At the crack of dawn, the boat, as if rejuvenated, valiantly overcame its challenges and sailed forward.

Ming'er had just finished breakfast and was warming himself in the sunlight, sitting on the deck at the bow, taking care not to obstruct the boatman's poling.

"Which town can we reach today? We need to go ashore and buy some vegetables, because the vegetables for tonight are all gone," he asked the boatman as soon as he sat down.

"We should definitely be able to reach Chun'an County today." The boatman, upon hearing that they wanted to go ashore, secretly felt annoyed, because their father and son would delay the journey. But since they needed to buy vegetables, he had to answer him.

"Are there vegetables to buy in Chun'an?" The moment he heard the name "Chun'an," he felt unfamiliar with it. Recalling his geography lessons in school, he realized he had never heard of this place, proving that book knowledge is limited. He used to get headaches whenever exams came around, disliking the abundance of homework. Now, thinking about it, the amount of homework was the bare minimum. He stopped dwelling on it. Hearing that the boatman hadn't answered his second, most important question, he quickly added, "Chun'an is a county, so it should be relatively lively, right?" "No! Chun'an, though called a county, is as small as a town. It only has one long street, which serves as its sole marketplace. Compared to Tunxi, even though Tunxi is just a town, it's far superior. Tunxi is really fun." The boatman spoke like he was giving a lecture, but still didn't get to the point, making Ming'er impatient.

"Is there any place to buy vegetables there or not?" Ming'er replied loudly.

"Where?" The boatman was completely confused. "Chun'an." "Yes, but by the afternoon, I'm afraid there won't be any left," the boatman answered vaguely. Ming'er stopped asking and went back into the cabin.

When wisps of smoke rose in the distance, they were within sight of Chun'an, according to the boatman's experienced eyes. But to Ming'er, it was all blurry. Since he had no sense of direction, he naturally didn't know where Chun'an was, so he wouldn't be able to see it anyway.

The Jiangshan boat continued to glide along like a snake, step by step, as the sun moved towards the center of the sky.

"Chun'an is almost here," the boatman said vaguely to Ming'er.

The people in the cabin were eating their lunch, eager to reach the shore in Chun'an at noon, so eating early would at least settle one matter. Ming'er sat on a pile of bedding in a corner of the cabin, chewing heartily, thoroughly enjoying his meal.

Suddenly, the bow of the boat darkened. Ming'er saw four or five strapping armed soldiers in yellow-green uniforms, rifles shouldered, shiny bayonets fixed on the tips, and a row of bullets across their chests. The officer leading them had a triangular leather belt across his chest, a dark face, and gleaming eyes that sharply penetrated the cabin. The mouthful of rice in Ming'er's mouth made him afraid to chew, holding his breath and staring blankly at them. Ming'er's father and others had already stood up.

"Where did you come from? Where are you going? What are your names?" the officer, speaking with a Mandarin accent, questioned Ming'er's father, while also looking around the cabin and scrutinizing everyone on board.

"We are refugees from Hangzhou, and we are heading to Tunxi. We are two families of refugees here," Ming'er's father replied in a Ningbo dialect, handing him a business card. The officer glanced at it without a word. After questioning them for a while, he walked out of the boat cabin. Ming'er followed them out. Two boats were positioned across the river, filled with soldiers. The Jiangshan boat happened to be moored in the middle of the two boats. With two flags planted on the boats, the officers stepped onto them, gestured to the boatman, and then the Jiangshan boat slowly moved away from them.

### Save the Children

— Xing

Since the implementation of graduation exams for elementary school students, the curriculum in elementary schools has become heavier, especially in Shanghai's elementary schools. They disregard whether the elementary school students' bodies and minds can handle it, and simply cram all sorts of courses into their heads, leaving many children looking pale and gaunt, their minds wandering, which is truly pitiful to see.

Some elementary school students come from educated families, and after school, their families can help them review their lessons, allowing them to barely cope. But some students from business or working-class families have no one to help them. Besides facing their teachers' reprimands and being held back at the end of the semester, they have no other options.

Some courses are of course mandated by our education authorities, and we seem to be in no position to object. But seeing the suffering of elementary school students, we cannot help but appeal to our education authorities to quickly reconsider and revise the curriculum standards. As for those school authorities who have gone overboard, we hope they will, within their power, show more consideration for the health of elementary school students.

Nowadays, every elementary school student, starting from first grade, has significantly more coursework than elementary school students in the past. I don't believe that elementary school students in the past were truly dull, or that they grew up to be failures. So why take this unnecessary extra step? Many wealthy families, seeing the suffering of elementary school students, hire tutors to teach at home, which is really out of necessity. But how many elementary school students can enjoy such a privilege?

First and second graders are required to write compositions, and third graders are required to learn the phonetic alphabet, learning the four tones (yin ping, yang ping, shang sheng, qu sheng). I find it quite strange. It seems that elementary school students' learning ability is greater than that of university students (university graduates), because I know that many university students never understand the yin ping, yang ping, shang sheng, or ru sheng tones.

Speaking of the phonetic alphabet, if we want to teach elementary school students how to spell, why not use the Latinized new script? Wouldn't that be more convenient than the phonetic alphabet? Changing large square characters to small square characters is only moving from 100 paces to 50 paces. Where is the convenience?

Now that summer vacation is approaching, I can already picture many innocent and lively children looking dejected and exhausted. My heart truly aches! I want to shout: Save the children! (Proceeds from silent auction)

### Becoming a Young Radio Enthusiast (9)

— Xi Ren

5.  How to Assemble a Crystal Radio

Wang Min and his cousin worked diligently, and soon they had set up the antenna and ground wire. Wang Min looked at the newly erected antenna on the roof and the ground wire coming in through the window, feeling indescribably happy.

"Min, watch this!" Wang Min, who was lost in thought, was startled by his cousin's shout and replied, "Watch what?"

"Here," his cousin said to Wang Min, holding an empty cigar box, "To make a crystal radio, because there are few components and it's simple, you don't need a good aluminum casing (the chassis of an ordinary large radio is made of aluminum). We can just use this empty cigar box to make a good crystal radio."

"An empty cigar box can be used to make a radio? I've never seen that before." Wang Min was surprised to hear his cousin say that a radio could be made in an empty cigar box.

"Yes, an empty cigar box can be used to make a radio, I'm not wrong at all. If you don't believe me, you can ask others. Almost everyone who is just learning about radios starts with an empty cigar box. Because there are two advantages: 1. It's cheap. An ordinary cigar box costs less than a dime or two in a tobacco shop. 2. It's easy to assemble and disassemble. Because beginners often like to try new things, assembling one day and disassembling the next, it would be very troublesome to use an aluminum base, but a cigar box is very convenient."

"Because of these two advantages, that's why people use it," Wang Min interjected after his cousin finished speaking.

"That's right, who doesn't like advantages? Okay, let's stop wasting time and get down to business. Look, it's almost noon again, time for lunch."

After saying that, Wang Min's cousin picked up a box next to him with the lid turned upside down and said, "I've already turned the lid of this box upside down (see Figure 8 for how to do it), because it's more convenient to use that way."

"Then, how do you attach the capacitor, coil, etc. that you talked about before?" Wang Min, after listening to his cousin's long explanation, felt confused.

"Take it slow, don't rush me, let me tell you. You need to drill a large hole and four small holes in the lid of this box (their positions are shown in Figure 8a). The large hole is for mounting the capacitor. The four small holes are used as follows: the two on the left are for connecting the earphones, and the two on the right are for connecting the antenna and ground wire."

"Brother, I'm confused again. You just said to connect the earphones and the antenna and ground wire, but I don't know how to connect them."

"Right, right! Min, you really are smart, I forgot to tell you. You also need to buy four binding posts! I happen to have four of those here, but you probably don't know what they look like, let me get them for you." His cousin said, and went to rummage through a pile of things next to him, took out four small items, and said to Wang Min, "They look like this (see Figure 8b)."

### Museum

— Ji Quan

Little friends! When you have free time, the museum is a great place to go! It contains an incredibly rich wealth of knowledge, and it is filled with the relics of our ancestors. Yes, the museum can provide us with broad common knowledge, and we should go and appreciate the knowledge it offers us!

In the past, the magnificent downtown area had a museum with an extremely rich collection of materials, but it was destroyed in the sounds of gunfire in Shanghai – we lost another good friend rich in knowledge!

Now, Shanghai also has a museum, located on Museum Road, a quiet location, and it is visited by many people. Moreover, it is free to enter, a beneficial and inexpensive place that we should visit more often!

This museum is, of course, not comparable in scale to the Shanghai Municipal Museum, but it is more than enough to provide children with general knowledge for browsing. Inside, there are specimens and skeletons of many kinds of animals, such as the skeletons of whales, and there are also many ancient coins, all of which are enough to inspire our knowledge.

Today is Sunday again. Remember that this publication once introduced several places for you little friends to visit today, such as parks, Culture Street... etc. I will also join in the fun and introduce you to the museum, hoping that your knowledge will be as broad as that of the museum!

### Among the Beasts (5)

— Xin Qing

Besides Knox, Peng Qi's father, Xin, had another dog named Love. It was a hunting dog breed with fur like metal wire all over its body, and short ears and tail. It had a chain around its neck, and when it walked on all fours, the chain would clang. Its fur color was gray-brown, but its chest was white, and its paws looked as if they were wearing light-colored woolen socks. Its eyes had been scratched by a cat, and its thin body was almost covered with various scars because it was often abused. Also, because it was always locked in a damp kennel in the winter, even its bark was hoarse. Poor thing, it often lived a miserable life. Cats and mice would bully it, and its young master would abuse it, kicking and hitting it were commonplace. Because it had suffered all kinds of torment, its temper had become savage.

Although Peng Qi abused it, he also felt some pity for it, seeing that it was always in a bad environment, its body getting thinner day by day, its scars multiplying day by day, and its fur getting grayer day by day. Yet it was very patient, able to accept anything that came its way, and this aroused Peng Qi's pity. As for Knox, Peng Qi really hated it, but because it was a big dog, it was not easy to bully, so he both hated it and was somewhat afraid of it.

Besides abusing Love, Peng Qi also played practical jokes on it for entertainment. Sometimes he would also joke with Knox, his tricks were endless.

Knox was old and liked to enjoy some comfort. Whenever it had worked hard outside, it would have a hearty meal, and after the meal it would go to a warm room and lie down on the soft and comfortable rug by the fireplace.

If something disturbed its rest or annoyed it, it would make a grumbling sound, as if talking to itself. Later, the grumbling gradually decreased, and its furry eyelids gradually closed, until it let out a strange cry and fell asleep. Its beautiful and black body lay motionless on the red sheepskin rug, the black and red complementing each other especially beautifully. Before long, it had entered dreamland. At this time, it would make some low barks and whimpers, and its legs would twitch constantly. In its dreams, it might still be working to save people by the river, which is why it behaved like this. But if its master whistled, it would immediately break its dream and jump up.

If it was quiet all around, it would simply sleep soundly, its back against the ground, its neck and legs stretched out straight, sleeping very comfortably. So Peng Qi took this opportunity to tease it. He sat close to Knox and gently pricked its lips with a fine needle. Knox was half awake, shook its head, and rubbed its paws on its lips with disgust, but before long it fell asleep again.

Seeing it asleep, Peng Qi busied himself with teasing it again, because these abusive tricks were his favorite thing in life. Finally, he used all his strength and forcefully pricked its lips; Knox, hurt by the pain, immediately woke up and jumped up. The needle was deeply embedded in its lips and broke off, and was finally discovered by the two little sisters.

Seeing their beloved dog suffering, the sisters began to cry. Usually, they were not afraid of Knox. Although it would sometimes open its mouth, revealing its snow-white teeth, pretending to bite their little hands, it did so lightly, lightly, its teeth were almost like eggshells, so they didn't feel anything at all. At this time, one of the two sisters, the bolder one, held its lips and managed to pull out the broken needle. Knox sat there quietly, moaning softly and wagging its tail slightly; after the operation was completed, it threw both sisters to the ground and licked their faces repeatedly, expressing its gratitude.

### Western-Style Printing House Established in Beijing

A Western-style printing house has been established in Beijing, located in front of the Yingwudian Yamen. The General Administration purchased two sets of large and small lead type from the Ying Wa College in Hong Kong, worth over 2,000 taels of gold. Huang Jun Pingfu personally brought them to Beijing and presented them to the Zongli Yamen. The Inspector General of Customs, Hart, etc., have also arranged for the Meihua Publishing House in Shanghai to procure the No. 1 regular script lead type, along with all the necessary equipment such as type cases and racks, as well as two printing presses and racks. These have been shipped by steamer to Beijing and are expected to begin operations soon. The hired printers and typesetters are all from Ningbo. Movable type printing was first invented in China by the commoner Bi Sheng. The copperplate printing of the Kangxi era and the wooden movable type "Precious Collection" printing of the Qianlong era were extremely exquisite. In the West, the use of Chinese movable type was first introduced by the Englishman Marshman, who initiated it in Penang and then moved it to Hong Kong. Recently, the Meihua Publishing House in Shanghai has used chemical and electrical methods to cast type, which is cheaper and faster. Westerners initially used steel type punches, then copper type matrices, manufactured in furnaces. Even thousands of type sets can be produced endlessly.

### Overseas Students Arrive at Nagasaki Island

The students from the Shanghai Overseas Study Bureau have departed for America for the second time. They recently sailed on a ship and arrived at Nagasaki Island, where they stopped briefly. Local Chinese merchants gathered to discuss how they would show the hospitality of the hosts and fulfill their duties as hosts. They prepared a lavish banquet, cooking phoenixes and dragons, to entertain the students.

### Strict Enforcement of Curfew

In Shanghai, the opening and closing of the city gates has always been strictly controlled. Recently, because the area is a trading zone for both Chinese and foreigners, there are many merchants and residents entering and leaving the city, especially those who go out early and return late. Therefore, the regulations have been relaxed, allowing them to pass with permits. However, a curfew was suddenly announced the night before last, with all gates being locked at 6 PM and no later. It is said that this will be a permanent rule from now on.

Spring and Autumn

### Radiance in the Gallery

— Wen Zhaotong

—On Hezi's Woodcuts—

Are the young people who are immersed in the palace of art all day long, pursuing the harmony of lines and the rhythm of colors, purely enjoying the atmosphere, pursuing taste and brushwork, as if they have forgotten the motherland and are only pursuing the cultivation of aestheticism?

The reality, after all, differs from expectations. One bright morning, sunlight shone from the sky onto the earth, and a piercing contrast of black and white suddenly appeared in the dim gallery, attracting the eyes of passersby. It turned out that Hezi's woodcuts were on display there.

Speaking of woodcuts, in the current stage of China, it is a much-needed art, because with just a piece of wood and a few knives, reality can be depicted, thereby inspiring the masses and guiding the masses. Woodcuts are not as mysterious as surrealist paintings, nor as ethereal as Taoist-like traditional Chinese paintings, but are a force, a bugle call, a leader of the times!

Hezi is still an art student. She usually paints nudes, landscapes, and still lifes in oil paints, watercolors, and meticulous sketches. Logically, she should only have some so-called pure art pieces for people to appreciate, doing "idle" things. But, in fact, quite the opposite, she is a female woodcut artist with a progressive consciousness, a fighting partner standing at the forefront.

The characteristic of her works, first of all, is the depth of her sketching skills, which is perhaps easily overlooked by general woodcut artists. It seems that the quality of a woodcut depends on the subject matter, but works without a foundation in sketching do not have sufficient expressiveness. Merely having a superior subject matter can only be considered an illustration, because without refined techniques, it cannot arouse the emotions of the viewer, and ultimately it cannot be considered art.

Hezi's woodcuts are now absorbing foreign styles. Originally, an artist's success, the acceptance and influence of styles, is an inevitable stage. Therefore, many of her works are derived from the study of the Belgian woodcut artist Frans Masereel. This phenomenon can be seen in terms of composition and knife technique, such as "Children, Don't Forget Your Hometown by the River!" If she could do more research on Russian woodcut artists such as V. Favorsky and A. Kravcyhenko, she could achieve further depth in her expression.

Recently, she is carving twelve continuous pieces of "Daughters of the Era," which are meant to indicate that women in the great era should not be good wives and mothers in the family, but should work hard for the nation and the country.

Finally, I feel that expanding the life experiences of artists is very important. Therefore, Hezi is a promising young artist who should break away from this narrow island environment and enter into an active life.

(The attached picture is one of the "Daughters of the Era")

### Regarding Charles Laughton: Thoughts After Seeing "The Suspect"

— Li Zhihua

Charles Laughton's popularity with audiences is the best evidence of the triumph of acting. Otherwise, someone like Charles Laughton, who is neither a stunning beauty nor a dashing young man, should be met with indifference by audiences. However, his popularity is not a stroke of luck, nor is it due to some so-called genius without any basis. His success is due to diligence and hard work, and even now, he remains the same. He is loyal to the roles he plays. Therefore, in order to understand the psychological makeup of the characters he plays, he often stays up all night. As R.R. Williamson said in "The Art of Charles Laughton," "When Laughton was preparing to play the role of Donipilli in the play 'On the Spot' - the original person of that Chicago gangster had already left the United States and retired to Italy. Laughton went to Italy, observed him, and studied him in his own environment without the main culprit even realizing it. This is a difficult example of his pursuit of absolute fidelity to the character."

There are many such examples. For instance, in order to experience the feelings of Rembrandt in the film "Rembrandt," he specially went to Amsterdam in the Netherlands and lived there for several weeks. Once he had determined the character of the role, it was difficult to change his mind. For example, during "The Private Life of Henry VIII," he almost had a falling out with Cecil B. DeMille over the character of Henry VIII. For someone so loyal to his roles, the success of his acting and his constant progress are inevitable. Williamson said that "He seems to be capable of playing any role." In reality, this is not merely a compliment. It also contains the reasons for his success and the process he goes through. You reap what you sow. How many Hollywood stars have come and gone, while Laughton stands tall in this torrent, and in the midst of this torrent, he appears even greater and indestructible!

Quintard in "The Suspect" is his new successful character (this is the first production of his own "Mayflower" company). Seeing this character immediately reminds us of Cai Chusheng's "Old Man Wang" and Lu Xun's "Ah Q." Of course, in Mao Hanxu's writing (the "Rage" we see on the screen has been adapted by Coward), he is not a copy of Old Man Wang or Ah Q. However, the three of them can be considered brothers of different ethnicities. Old Man Wang and Ah Q are insignificant figures in a historical tragedy. Quintard, however, is fortunate not to be Chinese, so he has a true "happy ending." Perhaps this is too mechanical a view. The birth of these three characters is due to the different ideologies of the authors. But even so, isn't it also because Quintard is fortunate not to be Chinese? - And therefore, this stubborn and dissolute Quintard is finally moved and experiences the joy of family life.

Perhaps I am conquered by Laughton's exquisite and profound acting (as a critic, one should not only accept and understand more than the average audience, but also dissect and analyze with more subtle and precise observation. From this, it can be proven that I am not a critic—certainly not worthy of the name "authority"—because I cannot.). After watching "The Suspect," my brain was completely occupied by Laughton's shadow. My ability to analyze has disappeared. So, regarding acting, how should I explain my feelings?

Many foreign newspapers have praised Laughton and his wife, Elsa Lanchester, for their vivid portrayal of the two characters in this play, which I agree with. But what impresses me even more is his accumulation of subtle movements. It is because of these subtle movements that Quintard's stubborn and dissolute character is vividly displayed. Moreover, from this, you simply cannot find traces of Edward Barrett in "Mutiny on the Bounty" or Bligh in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street." - In short, it makes us unable to forget his loyalty to the role.

The director can be praised for the scene on the desert island. Quintard carrying Jones ashore and then carrying her back to the ship from hunger is a good contrast. Jones' "sleepless night" on the island, coupled with that frightened, forced, and intermittent singing, is even more clever. Yes, Elsa Lanchester should also be praised in this regard. Her face is not beautiful, but her acting is extremely beautiful.

The ebb and flow of movies change too quickly, but Laughton stands tall with his diligent efforts.

### Mr. Zhang Shutong's Recent Work

### Is Wang Jingwei Really Going to Japan?

— Fo

Recently, there have been rumors about what Wang Jingwei is doing in Shanghai. At first, I doubted it, thinking that even if Wang was mentally unstable, he would not be so reckless as to go against the tide. Later, as more and more people spread the rumors, and the more they talked, the more credible their words seemed, I began to suspect that he was at his wit's end, and might not be able to avoid being shameless and engaging in this "selling himself to the enemy." However, I still thought that if Wang still had any conscience, he would not willingly do such a crazy thing.

Yesterday, I saw the news in this newspaper that Wang Jingwei was indeed going to Japan, where he would live, who he would be meeting with, and what he was going to Japan for. Therefore, what has been rumored about Wang can be believed. What else can I say? I can only borrow a phrase from the ancients to send him off:

"You had better take care of yourself, lest future generations laugh at your clumsiness."

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 12: A Beauty's Revenge Struggles to Erase Transgressions; Love Rekindled Through Green Windows

It is said that Zhao Letian was guarding the machine gun when he was hit in the foot by a hand grenade thrown by the enemy. The person who threw the grenade only threw it blindly, but the shrapnel scattered, and many pieces were embedded in Letian's leg. Originally, he wanted to move the machine gun, but now he fell forward and could not stand up. An assistant next to him asked, "Captain, what's wrong?" Zhao Letian said, "Not good! I'm afraid my leg is injured. You must protect the machine gun and don't let them steal it." At this time, in the darkness, he could not see how badly he was injured. He only felt that his leg was wet when he touched it with his hand, and it smelled of blood when he sniffed it. At first, he didn't feel anything, but later he gradually felt so much pain that his vision went dark. At that time, while guarding the machine gun, someone carried Zhao Letian on their back and temporarily settled him down in a villager's house in the dark. This time, our army was victorious, seizing thirteen enemy supply vehicles, three light machine guns, and dozens of rifles. Their casualties were three times greater than ours, but our captain was injured. Zhao Le forgot about the wound on his foot because of his victory, and all the shrapnel was not removed in time. Also, because the medical care in the team was not very complete, and he was a little too careless, and the rear hospital was a little far away, after several delays, his leg became infected. So when he was carried to the hospital, the injury was already very serious. Zhao Letian didn't take it seriously, because he thought: Didn't I write to Pan Peiying and tell her: Soon you will hear the news of Zhao Letian sacrificing himself for the country. Now that I am dead, that is seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, what is there to complain about? But later, after careful diagnosis and treatment by several doctors in the hospital, they had to amputate his leg to save his life. Therefore, Zhao Letian became a one-legged man. So at that time, it was true that Zhao Letian said to Wu Junsu in the train the day before: My parents are both dead, and I have never married a wife. I am a bachelor, and there is nothing to hinder me. But he didn't know that there was still a love history in him. At that time, there was also a friend of his who said: Zhao Letian is so brave in battle and disregards his own safety, perhaps it is also because he has been stimulated by unrequited love? This is a bit of a slight to Zhao Letian, just because Zhao Letian wrote to Pan Peiying, vowing to sacrifice himself to repay the country, people put love and loyalty together. Sometimes people joked with him like that. Because Zhao Letian is an optimist, he also likes to joke with his friends. (133)

### (I) These Days, Words Are Spoken

One day, old age (yesterday), middle age (today), and youth (tomorrow) were talking together. Tomorrow said: "You, yesterday, are a backward person, you, today, give people realistic pain, only I give people hope and happiness." Old age (yesterday) heard the bragging of the inexperienced youth (tomorrow) and said angrily: "I have seen a lot, and I see that people's hearts are not as good as before, and the morality of the world is declining. I have recorded the secret history of everyone's crimes, and people cannot help but compliment me. If you, tomorrow, give people empty hope, how can you not know that I, old age, can announce their past misdeeds and shatter their hope?" Yesterday was selling old age, and tomorrow was full of youthful vigor. The conversation between the three became a stalemate. Only today sat with a wide-open bosom. The author hereby speaks for today: "Tomorrow has not yet arrived, so please be quiet! Yesterday has already determined people's crimes, so we must find a way to resolve them. Because everyone is already guilty, happiness is taken away by yesterday. If the sins of yesterday are not cleared, the ending of tomorrow will be in prison! Therefore, while there is still today, believe this saving proverb: 'The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus.'" — Shanghai Christian Literature Society, P.O.

The World of Entertainment

### Wu Xiaobang's New Dance Works

— Xitong

Regarding dance, what we usually see is so-called social dance in dance halls or song and dance on the stage. It was truly a pleasant surprise to be able to see Wu Xiaobang's "New Short Poetry and Dance Works" at the Ningbo Native Place Association on the evening of the 6th. What Xiaobang and his students danced was neither social dance nor leg show, but meaningful dance. After watching it, I had some thoughts:

First, tireless efforts. Xiaobang's dance performance is definitely the fifth one. This spirit of redoubled effort and the enthusiasm for establishing dance art are worthy of admiration. Seeing him perform seven shows in a row in the hot weather, changing seven sets of clothes, and also taking care of the props, lights, and piano backstage and in front, sweating profusely, we can see his perseverance and endurance. If it weren't for his students Li Shifang, Sheng Jie, Yang Fan, Wu Shiyun, and Lu Jiji interspersed performances, allowing him to rest a little, he wouldn't know how tired he would be.

Second, clear dance postures. The meaning contained in the dance postures is mostly easy to understand and very clear. Xiaobang intends to create a new Chinese opera and also adopts the essence of Peking opera and Kunqu opera. Therefore, from the illusion of a layman like me, the shaking of the head up and down can be said to have something in common with the shaking of the beard of the old Chu Biao in the Wax Temple; the swaying of the buttocks of the worshiper can also be said to be the country relatives sending off the wedding procession; the "Wish" performed by Sheng Jie may be "The Peony Pavilion" touring the garden: This analogy is inappropriate, but I did have these associations at the time. As for the shaking of sleeves in the Jiaoguan dance, even the old opera fans are no more than this, right?

Third, appropriate accompaniment. For example, "Collecting Boys" is accompanied by the music of Russian Mussorgsky, the composer of "Children's Song in the Country"; "Companion" is accompanied by the music of German Brahms, the composer of "To the Lover"; "Nightmare" is accompanied by the music of Russian Rachmaninoff, the composer of "The Miserly Knight"; "Give a Rose" is accompanied by the music of American MacDowell, the composer of "Love Song."

Fourth, profound meaning. For example, "People Growing Up in the Era" walk heavily, act extremely, and dare to act with strong hands; although there is no music, the continuous heavy stomping sounds of the first turn and the fifth turn are continuous, and they also have musicality, as if a barbarian woman is dancing on a drum. "Free Man" is assisted by a brisk march, which is also very pleasing. "Hesitation" explains that seeking Buddha and pleasing him are both useless, and only resistance is effective. The hesitant person finally dies under the devil's hand. What is most welcomed by the audience is "Ugly Showing Off," and before it even comes on stage, the audience gives it warm applause. Then Xiaobang appears in a posture similar to Jiaoguan. This handling is very appropriate. It is said that Jiaoguan is Feng Dao, so Xiaobang adopted the original meaning. Sometimes swaying, ecstatic, and sometimes bowing and flattering, cringing and smiling, vividly portraying the ugliness of the new Feng Dao, I want to applaud him.

— Xin Ying

U.S. President Roosevelt's wife recently praised producer Samuel Goldwyn as a magical gambling hero in the film industry because of the public release of "Wuthering Heights." The story of this film is based on the literary work written by Emily Bronte, one of the three Bronte sisters, British female writers of the 19th century. The president's wife recently saw a preview of this film in Hollywood, so she published her feelings in "My Day" in the newspaper. According to Roosevelt's eldest son

The Biggest Reason Why Yu Shuyan is Unwilling to Perform

Many people suspect that Shuyan's art must have deteriorated compared to before, and that his voice is not as good as it used to be. In fact, that is all too much worry. As far as I know, he not only practices his voice more diligently than any other famous actor, but also his second wife, Mrs. Yao, and her father and daughter are all opera fans. In order to win the favor of his father-in-law and new wife, he will also seize the opportunity to act as Feng Fu again, so that they can have a great time watching opera. However, all true famous actors will never perform hastily, so as not to lose their past reputation. Mr. Yao is a famous doctor in Beiping. Shuyan is doing his best to ask his old father-in-law to diagnose and treat his previous three kinds of blood diseases (hematemesis, hematochezia, hemorrhoid bleeding), and at the same time, he is working hard to train a good qin player, so as to avoid any mistakes on stage. The dead ghost Li Peiqing was trained by Yu Sanjiao. In the past, such famous actors as Gui Fen, Qiu Guixian, and Shi Xiaoshi all played very well. Shuyan, Qing Kui, Baosen, Duokui, and others also have a lot of research on the huqin. Shuyan spent a lot of effort to create a Li Peiqing, who not only set off the performance very well, but also had a qin sound that was neither too rigid nor too soft, and completely matched his voice. Since Peiqing's death, Shuyan has been like losing an arm, and from then on, he has the intention of declining to sing on stage. Later, after many friends tried their best to persuade him, saying that you have spent decades of hard work and learned so much ability, if you lose it all, wouldn't it be a pity? So he brought Zhu Jiakui over and went to his house late at night to practice his voice every day. After training for nearly seven or eight years, Jiakui was able to figure out Shuyan's temperament, and he had long understood the various tunes of the Yu School, so naturally he made great progress compared to before. Shuyan just felt that his interest was a little better and he had the intention of performing, but unexpectedly, Qian Jinfu, Wang Changlin, and other old partners died one after another, and now only Bao Jixiang is left. Qian Baosen can still inherit his father's business, and his tricks are also very good, that is, when he plays with Shuyan, he will not be much different from his father. It's just that it's too difficult to find a clown. Changlin's son, Fushan, is simply not worth playing with. Fulu has already become famous, but if you ask him to follow Shuyan's scope, he is not very willing. (Three calls) James Roosevelt recently joined Samuel Goldwyn's organization as chairman of the board. This decision by the President's wife to praise Samuel Goldwyn may be due to sympathy for her son's joining the film industry, right?

The wife wrote in her feelings: "At the beginning of the film, the scene of Heathcliff Moore is surprisingly successful. Although it is not like this at the end of the film. The story of the whole film is very faithful, the handling is also very appropriate, and regarding the expression of human emotions, no one will ignore it. This is a major factor in the success of the original novel. The audience may not be able to lose their sense of story tension when watching this film. Finally, the success of love in all kinds of struggles is also what everyone of us believes in."

"The person who made such a film is truly a gambling hero with magic! Goldwyn told me that millions of viewers will watch this film because the film itself has this value. No doubt, before the preview, at the banquet, I saw Merle Oberon, she is a beautiful woman, and Goldwyn has been in the film industry for quite a long time, he knows what kind of films, which stars and which other artists the audience wants to see."

Due to the President's wife's praise in writing, people in general have paid special attention to this film. Now this film is being publicly released in New York and major cities in the United States. Whether it is a film critic or an ordinary film audience, they all admit that this film is a valuable work, and they think that the President's wife has good eyesight!

Movie Theaters Adjust Seat Prices Recently, there has been a shortage of steel coins on the market, which has affected all industries. Some food stores have been using stamps instead of coins to make change. Generally, movie theaters charge a charity donation of 10% in addition to the ticket price. Because there are no copper coins, it is quite inconvenient to collect change. Therefore, seat prices have been adjusted to cope with this situation. The original seat prices of the Central Grand Theater were 28 cents downstairs, 33 cents upstairs, and 44 cents in the moon building. From today onwards, the upstairs and downstairs seats will be sold at a uniform price of 30 cents, and the moon building will be priced to include the charity donation. The Empire will also follow suit.

### Skating Technique (24)

— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen

1.  Outside Edge Forward Stroke

To begin an outside edge forward stroke, the supporting leg must be kept behind, with the toes pointed outward and downward, and the leg slightly bent but not stiff. The supporting foot's toes are above the circle line drawn by the skating foot, but slightly outward. The skating knee must be deeply bent. When using the inside edge of the supporting foot to propel, more force must be applied to the heel. The body is upright with the head raised. The arms should not be raised too high. The body should lean towards the center of the circle. The skating hip must be below the skating shoulder, and should not protrude outward, as this is unsightly. The supporting hip must be behind, but not too far behind, so that the supporting foot does not run parallel to the circle line. The head must be turned towards the same side as the skating shoulder. The above is the body's position in the first style. When half of the circle line has been passed, the body must begin to rotate. The supporting shoulder, supporting hip, and supporting leg, which were originally behind, must gradually move forward. The skating shoulder and skating arm move back slightly, and the head faces directly forward. This is the body's position in the second style. When the first circle is about to end, the supporting shoulder has reached the position it will be in when starting the next stroke.

Regardless of which side is being used for movement, except for the skating foot, the limbs must have their positions changed midway. After the position is changed, the body and the skating leg must be slightly straighter, and the center of gravity slightly shifted to the rear of the ice skate. Before the position is changed, the supporting leg must follow behind according to the direction of movement, and the skating leg must lead in front. After the position is changed, the supporting leg becomes the leading leg. (Note: The supporting leg following behind does not necessarily have to be behind the skating foot's heel. For example, when moving backwards, the supporting leg follows behind in front of the skating foot's toes, and leads in front of the skating foot's heel.) The change in the body's position has a fixed order, that is, it must go from the first style to the second style, or from the third style to the fourth style.

Each large step can be divided into front and rear sections. If the body's position in the front section is in the first style, the body's position in the rear section must be in the second style. If the front section uses the third style, then the rear section must be in the fourth style.

The body's rotation to the second style in the second half of the circle not only reserves a position for the next stroke, but also helps to accelerate the speed of the stroke.

At the end of the first circle, the supporting foot quickly moves close to the skating foot and pushes forward, as if kicking a soccer ball. However, this is the beginning of the second circle. The former skating leg is now changed to the supporting leg. Following the method of the first circle, one returns to the center. Each foot must do this three times to complete the technique.

When the supporting leg passes the skating leg, it may be close to or far away from the skating leg, but it is always best to be moderate. I would rather be slightly closer than too far away, because being too far away is unsightly.

The body's rotation can be (A) started from the beginning of the circle, or (B) started only in the second half of the circle, but most people choose (B).

The most common mistake in the outside edge forward stroke is that the circle line is too curved and loses its shape, not forming a circle. The reason for this is that the body leans too much, the skating shoulder is not on the circle line, and when the supporting leg moves forward, it is too far away from the skating leg. It is best to exert force on the heel of the shoe. When the body's position is in the second style, it must not move at all in order to ensure that the two circles meet and there is no risk of losing shape.
