### Wang Jingwei Violates Discipline, Harms the Party and the Country; Central Standing Committee Resolves to Expel Him from the Party; He Leaves His Post Without Permission, Hides in Another Location, and Spreads Absurd Claims; Not Only is He Despised by the Central Government, But Also by the People of the Entire Nation; The Central Supervisory Committee Also Passes the Above Resolution in a Meeting

(Chongqing) The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee held a temporary meeting at 3:30 PM today. The Standing Committee members present were Feng Yuxiang, Wen Yuan, Juzheng, Ding Weifen, Zou Lu, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, and Dai Chuanxian. The Executive Committee members attending as observers were Jiao Yitang, Chen Shuren, Jiang Bocheng, Wen Lanyou, Hong Ludong, Gan Naiguang, Xiao Tongzi, Wang Luyi, Qian Dajun, Wu Zhongxin, He Jian, Fang Jue, He Chengrong, Lin Yizhong, Xia Douyin, Xiao Jishan, Xu Kan, Liang Hancao, Chuan Bingchang, Chen Shaokuan, Liu Jiwen, Chen Cheng, Zhang Daofan, Wang Faqin, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, Zhou Qigang, and Dai Kuisheng. The Alternate Executive Committee members were Zhao Dihua, Zhu Qing, Wang Yongbin, Wang Gong, Chen Fangxian, Zhao Yunyi, Luo Jialun, and Zhang Zhen. The Supervisory Committee members were Jiang Zuobin, Lin Sen, Qin Zhen, Wang Zizhuang, He Yaozu, Yang Hu, Wu Jingheng, Lin Yunhai, Zhang Ji, Shao Lizi, and Wang Chonghui. The Alternate Supervisory Committee members were also present, including Di Ying and Wang Shijie. The meeting was chaired by the President, discussing the case of Wang Zhaoming violating discipline and harming the Party and the country. It was resolved that Wang Zhaoming be permanently expelled from the Party and removed from all positions. At the same time, the Central Supervisory Committee also held a temporary standing committee meeting and passed the above resolution. The full text is as follows:

Wang Zhaoming, entrusted with important responsibilities by our Party, and at a time of urgent war, has left his post without permission, hidden in another location, and spread claims contrary to national policy. In a telegram sent on the 29th, he even based his absurd arguments on the enemy's Prime Minister Konoe's declaration to fundamentally destroy our country, seeking peace with the enemy. He published this in newspapers and widely distributed it, under the guise of advising the Central Government, using deceptive tricks to mislead the people. The content of his telegram is entirely in line with the enemy's demands, deliberately embellished, and unscrupulously reverses right and wrong, speaking on behalf of the enemy, and even goes further, assisting their deception. In terms of his actions, it is actually colluding with the enemy to seek surrender. In terms of its impact, it directly attempts to shake the foundation of the nation. Our country launched the War of Resistance for national salvation, with the deaths and injuries of over a million soldiers and the sacrifices of millions of compatriots. The deep and painful purpose is to fundamentally eliminate the enemy's aggressive schemes, so as to permanently protect the life of our nation and people for generations to come. For more than a year, the people have been spiritually united, and the soldiers have bravely given their lives, with everyone united in one heart, all concentrated under the leadership of the President of our Party, determined and unyielding, with the confidence to achieve victory. Now, the enemy's ambition to plot against us is becoming more obvious, and their tricks are becoming more vicious. This only makes our nation's indignation against the enemy more intense and our determination more firm. What Wang has said is not only despised by the Central Government, but also by the people of the entire nation. During the war, no citizen is absolutely allowed to violate the decisions of wartime national policy and act on their own initiative. Party discipline absolutely does not allow exceeding the Party's formal resolutions, violating Party rules, and expressing personal opinions. Wang Zhaoming's actions are a clear violation of discipline and harm to the Party and the country. With righteousness at stake, there is no room for leniency. He is hereby permanently expelled from the Party and removed from all positions, in order to rectify Party discipline and correct officialdom. Our people must know that the most important key to winning the War of Resistance lies in unified will and unwavering spirit. In the past, our nation suffered repeated foreign insults, such as the Song and Ming dynasties, which were merely the collapse of a dynasty of one surname and one family, not the destruction of our nation. However, the principle that led to defeat was that a small number of treacherous and evil officials in the court at that time lost all conscience, leading to destruction. It was definitely not that the people's morale and national strength were unable to resist the enemy. Therefore, today's War of Resistance requires rectifying discipline in order to boost morale, and eliminating discord in order to defeat the strong enemy. Looking at the enemy's recent poisonous schemes, they are actually trying to threaten our spirit and lead us to division and destruction. Our Party deeply knows that the national consciousness of our compatriots throughout the country has been universally promoted, and the great righteousness of the Spring and Autumn period has deeply penetrated people's hearts. Only by relying on a firm and unwavering spirit of struggle, strictly abiding by national policy, and unifying will, will final victory surely be achieved. From now on, the national policy of the War of Resistance will take the speech delivered by the President of our Party at the Central Memorial Week on the 26th of last month as the only standard. May all comrades and soldiers throughout the country follow this will and do their best. All speeches and actions that violate this spirit are not tolerated by national interests and laws, and are jointly rejected by the people of the country, in order to maintain the will of wartime and complete the mission of our Three People's Principles' revolution to save the country.

(Chongqing) The government has not commented on Wang's telegram. Government officials state that they have not yet received the telegram, so there is no way to know whether the telegram was actually sent by Wang or by other parties. Therefore, they intend to wait until this matter is clarified before issuing a formal opinion. Well-informed sources have long expected Wang's efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Japanese War, but they are very surprised that Wang is taking this action at this time. It is reported that after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and before the fall of Nanjing and Hankou, Wang repeatedly proposed peace negotiations. However, each decision was rejected by Chairman Chiang and other political leaders due to their determination to resist the war. Various Chinese circles now believe that China's position is very solid, and that it has never been as good as it is today since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. They put forward the following four factors: (1) The Chinese army has been completely reorganized for long-term war; (2) Due to British and American loans, China's financial position has become more stable; (3) Because the British and Americans are suspicious of Japan's guarantee to protect the interests of third countries in China, China's international position has become stronger; (4) China is now more united than before. The southwestern and northwestern provinces are all united and solid as Chairman Chiang's backing to resist the Japanese army's deep invasion into the interior. The deeper the Japanese army invades, the more advantageous the Chinese army's resistance becomes. Chinese circles also say that if Wang had proposed peace negotiations after the fall of Hankou, the situation at that time would have been very unfavorable to China, and the impact would have been unimaginable. Today, the situation has greatly improved, but Wang is advocating this fallacy, which is really incomprehensible. They believe that Wang's move will not only be opposed by the government, but also strongly condemned by the people of the country. However, whether this telegram was actually sent by Wang is still a question. (1st Reuters dispatch)

(Paris) After Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro announced his policy towards China, Wang Jingwei immediately sent a telegram advocating peace. Most newspapers here have commented on this. The far-right newspaper "Little Daily News" stated, "At the time when Wang Jingwei issued a peace proposal, the US government also issued a note to Japan, refusing to accept the unilateral abolition of the Open Door Policy. The coincidence of these two events should not be ignored. The Japanese government anticipated that the United States was afraid of taking direct action, and that the United States' natural ally would not have time to attend to other matters, so it resorted to speculative means. What we urgently want to know after Wang Jingwei's telegram is whether the Chinese side will respond accordingly, so that Japan can use the will of a large part of the Chinese people as an excuse to silence the United States. On the contrary, no one on the Chinese side responded to the peace proposal. Japan still believes that the US government will abide by the legacy of former President Washington, 'Do not provoke disputes,' and disregard the US government's condemnation." The moderate newspaper "Order" stated, "After Wang Jingwei defected, the people in the northern provinces of China, who mostly supported the Zhili clique more than ten years ago, may not respond to him. Although there is talk that a certain general in southern China intends to organize a government in Guangzhou, even if this government is established, its power will not be enough to consolidate Japan's power in southern China. Based on this, even though Japan uses the excuse of inciting disputes, falsely claiming that the government led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is disintegrating, the National Government can still maintain unity in its will to resist the aggressor. Unless the conditions proposed by Japan are compatible with the right of the Chinese nation to survive, there can be no peace talks." The radical socialist newspaper "Republican" stated, "Although Chongqing was shaken after Wang Jingwei's telegram advocating peace was published, there is no evidence for Japan's claim that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek actually agreed with Wang Jingwei to conduct peace talks." (31st Havas dispatch)

(London) Reuters learned today that Chinese circles in London are regretful about the "peace" telegram that Wang Jingwei allegedly sent to Chairman Chiang, fearing that it would give the outside world the incorrect impression that members of the Chinese government have split. They firmly stated that, leaving aside the fact that Wang's faction is unhappy with the government's alliance with the Communists, the vast majority of other Chinese people sincerely support Chairman Chiang. It is worth noting that Chairman Chiang's condemnation of Japan's peace proposals has been supported by the entire country. Therefore, there is no possibility of negotiating peace with Japan at this time. The Chinese circles also rejected Japan's intention to have China join the Japanese "Manchukuo" economic group, because this move would be tantamount to placing China under Japan's complete control. Commentators on Wang's actions are generally suspicious of the forces around him, but everyone scoffs at the rumors that Wang will join one of the two governments in Nanjing or Peiping under Japan's protection. They also believe that Wang's failure in this move may try to obtain more moderate conditions from Japan and present them to Chairman Chiang. (1st Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Yesterday morning, Tokyo received Wang Jingwei's telegram to Chairman Chiang advocating peace. The telegram has been published in various morning newspapers, but because the entire country of Japan is engaged in New Year celebrations, it has not been criticized. (1st Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Japanese officials are currently refusing to criticize Wang Jingwei's "peace" telegram to Chairman Chiang. Although Japanese newspapers have published Wang's telegram in a prominent position, they are still keeping silent. This is probably because they believe that Wang has misunderstood several key points of Konoe's proposals, and they are waiting for the government to comment first before following up.

### The Situation of the War of Resistance Has Greatly Improved; Politics Should Be More Important Than Military Affairs in the Future; The National Government Held a Memorial Ceremony for the Founding of the Republic of China Yesterday; Chairman Lin's Speech Most Strongly Urged Compatriots Throughout the Country to Endure Hardships and Struggle

(Chongqing) The National Government held a memorial ceremony for the founding of the Republic of China at 8:00 AM on New Year's Day, presided over by Chairman Lin, who led the ceremony and delivered a speech on the spot. The ceremony was then concluded. (1st dispatch)

Chairman Lin's Speech

Ladies and gentlemen, today is New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China, which is also the anniversary of the founding of our Republic of China twenty-seven years ago, and also the anniversary of the inauguration of our Chinese Kuomintang's Premier Sun Yat-sen as the first President of the Republic of China in the first year of the Republic. Because of the Premier's advocacy of revolution, the Republic of China was founded. And because of the Premier's inauguration as President, the republican government and democratic politics were produced. Therefore, in holding this memorial ceremony today, in addition to the usual celebration of this year's New Year's Day, we must also very piously pay our respects to our Premier for his revolutionary spirit, and more practically examine our past work achievements and determine our future efforts. On the one hand, we must correct our past shortcomings, and on the other hand, we must improve our future effectiveness, continue our Premier's revolutionary legacy, and complete our Premier's unfinished business, so as not to fail the hard work of our Founding Father in creating the Republic of China, and not to fail this glorious and great anniversary today. Speaking of the work of the past year, in the military aspect, since the launch of the all-out war of resistance, thanks to the capable command of our military commander Chairman Chiang, the loyal and brave service of all the officers and soldiers, and the joint struggle of the people of the whole country, during the first phase of the war of resistance, the enemy's strategies of "subjugating China without a fight" and "quick victory" have been shattered. During this year and six months of combat, although we have lost many lands and cities, strategically speaking, not only has the enemy's plan become a bubble and completely failed to materialize, but we have also fully reaped the beneficial effects of "protracted war" and "war of attrition." This cannot but be regarded as our great success in the military. Now the military has entered a new stage in the second phase of the war of resistance, and our strategy has also undergone a new determination. The focus of future warfare will be to strive for the initiative and focus on attacking the enemy's rear, so that the enemy will be in a passive position, exhausted, and sink deeper and deeper, with no possibility of further incursion. And the main force of our army is not only still intact, but also gradually strengthened. Most of the future combat will be in mountainous areas, and the deeper the enemy goes, the more difficult it will be, and the situation will be more favorable to us. We will surely be able to achieve the goals of "protracted war," "total war," and "striving for the initiative." The overall situation of the war of resistance will definitely improve greatly. We can deeply believe that the enemy will absolutely not be able to conquer China, and we will definitely be able to persist in resisting the war to the end and strive for the final victory.

Implementing the Program of Resistance and National Reconstruction

As for the political aspect, in order to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance, there have also been considerable improvements in the middle of the past year. For example, the adjustment of political institutions, the establishment of public opinion organs, the achievements of diplomatic operations, the consolidation of the financial foundation, the active economic construction, and the maintenance and promotion of education and culture are all quite significant achievements. In addition, other administrative, legislative, judicial, examination, and supervisory affairs have been able to complete their special wartime tasks thanks to the serious supervision of the responsible officials and the diligence of their staff. The people have also been able to work together with one heart and one mind, whether in the war zone, the guerrilla zone, or in other areas, enduring all suffering, firmly determined to resist the war, with the belief in victory, supporting the government, obeying the leader, contributing manpower and material resources, not shunning sacrifice, and fighting in unison, fulfilling the responsibilities that everyone should fulfill. This is something that we can be proud to tell the people of the country. However, in this second phase of the war of resistance, politics should be more important than military affairs, the rear should be more important than the front, and the people should be more important than the army. We not only cannot be complacent about these small achievements in the past, but we must especially know that the great difficulties ahead will deepen day by day, and that our responsibilities will increase day by day. We must go further and continue to cultivate and struggle. From this New Year's Day, we must determine our future efforts, with the sole purpose of implementing the Program of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We must deeply understand that only this Program of Resistance and National Reconstruction is our established national policy, and only it is our guiding principle and clear direction for future efforts. Only by implementing the Program of Resistance and National Reconstruction, so that the various clauses and needs in this program can be completely fulfilled one by one, can we complete the National Revolution and implement the Three People's Principles in a practical and bright way.

Everyone Takes on Extraordinary Responsibilities

We must especially know that the purpose of the war of resistance is to maintain international peace and promote the great harmony of the world. And because of the evolution of our country's special history and the urgency of the situation, the two matters of war of resistance and national reconstruction have a kind of inseparable relationship. Without war of resistance, there can be no national reconstruction, and without national reconstruction, there can be no war of resistance. The two are to complement each other and advance simultaneously. We must both resist the war and build the nation in order to achieve our goal. The degree of hardship and difficulty in this work of building the nation in the war of resistance and resisting the war in national reconstruction is naturally not comparable to ordinary times. In this extraordinary era, we must take on this extraordinary responsibility. If we do not make extraordinary efforts in extraordinary times, we will not be able to complete our extraordinary tasks. As the ancients said, "The plan for the year lies in spring, and the plan for the day lies in morning." I hope that all our comrades and compatriots throughout the country will start from today, make the determination to start anew, embrace the spirit of self-improvement, endure hardships and struggle, redouble our efforts, and complete our great mission of resisting the war and building the nation, so as not to fail this glorious memorial today. Finally, we must respectfully wish the Republic of China long live, and the health of everyone. (1st dispatch)

Editorial

### The Victorious Situation in the Second Phase of the War of Resistance

In terms of the qualitative transformation of the overall situation of the War of Resistance, after the Chinese army abandoned Wuhan, it has shifted from the first phase of retreat and defense to the second phase of guerrilla warfare and counter-offensive. In this second phase of the War of Resistance, China has gained the advantage of exhausting the enemy and strengthening itself, which was created in the first phase, and the prospect of victory is becoming more apparent.

In the military aspect, the casualties of more than 500,000 Japanese soldiers and the consumption of countless firearms have made them lose the false prestige of a first-class power. At the same time, the Chinese army has gradually retreated after obtaining considerable gains from various points and lines, and has now lured the enemy deep into the mountainous areas. This has not only extended the battle line, dispersed and weakened the enemy's military strength, but also turned the battlefield into a plane, so that the enemy's land and water routes cannot echo each other, and heavy weapons lose their power. It is also easier for the Chinese army to change the positional warfare into mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare, and change the passive defensive warfare into offensive warfare. Recently, the widespread establishment, strengthening, and expansion of Chinese guerrilla teams in various areas in front of and behind the Japanese army will make the Japanese army even more exhausted. In future battles, the contrast between the Japanese side's consumption of firearms and soldiers and the Chinese army's will increase. This is the fatal wound of their failure and the key to China's victory.

Politically, from the beginning of the War of Resistance to the present, the entire Chinese nation has embraced the determination to resist the war for a long time. This has shattered the Japanese side's conspiracies such as "using Chinese to control Chinese" and "quick victory." Recently, although Wang Jingwei suddenly issued his personal bizarre views, the government and the people have risen up to denounce them, which is enough to prove that their will to resist the war is extremely firm and cannot be shaken. At the same time, the gradual reform of China's political institutions, the increasing strengthening of political work in the army, and the increasing political awareness of the people and their participation in the war have enhanced the comprehensiveness of the War of Resistance. On the other hand, although the Japanese side has also bought puppets and puppet troops in the occupied areas, these ugly people, who are abandoned by the masses, cannot play a significant role. Moreover, many of them are not convinced and often have the crisis of rebellion and returning to the right path. Furthermore, the protracted war of aggression has given the Japanese soldiers and people more and more damage and pain every day. Therefore, the undercurrent of war-weariness and anti-war sentiment is rising. The anti-war activities of the People's Front in the country, and the rebellions and disturbances of the puppet troops and the people of Korea and Taiwan are all seen facts, and they will definitely spread and expand in the future. This is not only shaking the Japanese army's morale and the people's hearts, but also igniting the sparks of the Japanese domestic revolution.

Economically, the Japanese side's financial resources are being consumed three or four times more in this war than China's, resulting in a tendency for all preparations to be scarce. Moreover, the points and lines that they have seized in China are being harassed by the Chinese guerrillas. Not only can they not be used to develop resources, but they have to spend more money to support the garrison troops. In order to save the collapse of finance, they destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty and seized customs duties in the occupied areas, and excluded the commercial interests of third countries. However, this has caused a boycott movement from Britain and the United States, which has increased their predicament. As for China, the financial situation has always been stable, and the treasures of the inland are being developed. It can be said that the War of Resistance has promoted China's economic progress. Recently, the success of British and American loans has greatly increased China's economic power.

Diplomatically, the people of all democratic countries have always sympathized with and supported China's War of Resistance. The recent active support of the British and American governments and the establishment of loans are a major threat to Japan. His influence has indeed made China's war of resistance stronger, and Japan's aggression has become more tricky. It has also allowed the Soviet Union to dare to take a tougher stance towards Japan to contain the Japanese army. The recent negotiations on the fishing dispute are a clear proof. Therefore, at the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the united front against Japan and against aggression in the international community has begun. This is a victory for China's offensive diplomacy, and the blow it has given to the enemy, whether materially or spiritually, is very great.

In this second phase of the War of Resistance, we see that the three conditions sufficient to defeat and destroy Japanese imperialism are maturing: China's anti-Japanese united front has been completed and is being strengthened, the international anti-Japanese united front is being conceived, and the Japanese people's revolution is also brewing in secret. In addition, the military advantage gained by the transfer of the battleground and the change of the Chinese army's strategy is the victorious prelude to the large-scale annihilation war to recover lost territory in the third phase!

However, if China is to truly win the final victory, it is also necessary for the people to redouble their efforts subjectively, further strengthen national unity, and persist in fighting the war to the end. And everyone must contribute money and effort to shatter the divisive and provocative, peace-promoting atmosphere that the Japanese side may send out, as well as the deceptive and anesthetizing policies implemented in the occupied areas. Otherwise, if we slacken our efforts even a little, we will miss the favorable conditions that have already been created!

### US Government Announces Strong Note to Japan: Does Not Recognize Breach of Treaty, Creates New Situation; Any Proposals Can Only Be Discussed by a Conference of All Concerned Nations; British Authorities Agree with US Opinion and Have Also Notified Japan

(Washington) The US response to Japan's declaration of a "New Order in East Asia" has now been published, stating that the United States absolutely cannot recognize any country unilaterally establishing a so-called new order within another country's territory, acting as sovereign, and controlling the destiny of others. The American people and government absolutely cannot recognize any unilateral abandonment of American rights. The US government deeply believes that Japan's various restrictive measures against Americans are not only unfair and unreasonable but also fundamentally violate various international treaties to which the US and Japan are both parties, and to which many other countries are also parties. The note also states that the United States is prepared to discuss the China issue with Japan, but only on the basis of negotiations in which all countries holding treaty rights in China participate jointly. If Japan can make any proposals based on justice, fairness, and regard for the rights and obligations of all parties concerned, and if all relevant parties are free to discuss new aspects together, then the United States is prepared to give appropriate and full consideration. The note then attacks the puppet organizations established by the Japanese military in China, stating that exchange controls, the forced use of counterfeit currency, unauthorized revision of tariffs, and monopolistic market practices are all implemented in the name of puppet organizations, but at the behest of the Japanese government. Furthermore, these so-called authorities treat the interests of foreigners (including Americans) as nothing. The American people and government will never recognize the actions of any puppet organization that unilaterally deprives third countries of their rights, because fundamental principles of international relations, such as equal opportunity, cannot be unilaterally eliminated by one party. Considering the existing facts, Japan's actions, such as establishing a new order in the Far East, have clearly undermined sacred and solemn international treaties. (US Associated Press dispatch, 31st)

(Washington) Regarding the maintenance of the Open Door Policy in China, the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, recently submitted a note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. (Note: After the United States submitted a note to Japan on October 6, Japan submitted a reply on November 18. This US note is a response to Japan's reply.) The note stated in essence that the conduct and activities of American citizens in China have been restricted by the Japanese authorities, and Japan's own interests have thus been placed in a superior position. This is a discriminatory measure and is truly unfair. It should be known that the legal status of all related countries is already stipulated in treaties. If Japan wishes to amend these, it could have achieved its goals through normal procedures of international negotiations. Japan now claims the right to violate treaties with its talk of a "new order, new situation," which is absolutely unacceptable to the US government, as the new reality in China has been created by Japan. The conclusion is that "If Japan can present any proposals to all other related countries, including China, the US government is prepared to discuss them. The venue can be designated jointly by all related countries, and from now until then, the US government will reserve all existing rights, which cannot be changed."

The most important point of this US note is that the legal status of all countries in China can be modified based on proposals made by Japan. US diplomatic circles commented that this is not an indirect proposal to convene an international conference, but rather an attempt to tell Japan that it agreed to conduct negotiations in a difficult situation in 1921, and the Nine-Power Treaty was born. Today, this procedure still needs to be adopted. However, based on the information received here, Japan absolutely does not want to hold an international conference. Therefore, this US note is not so much a new initiative on the Far East issue as it is a reaffirmation of key principles. (Havas, 31st)

(Washington) The US government's note to Japan has been commented on by political observers. Although this note does not urge the establishment of a strong alliance by the countries concerned, it does advocate discussing the so-called new order in the Far East through an international conference. The intention seems to be to have other countries, such as Britain and France, adopt the same stance as the United States. The tone of this note is firm, but without intimidation. The US government refuses to recognize the new order created by Japan, but it does not explain how the US will respond if Japan persists in its views. In fact, Japan's actions are similar to Germany's attitude in Eastern and Central Europe. Germany enjoys hegemony east of the Rhine, which has been confirmed by the Munich Agreement. Japan wants to enjoy hegemony in China, and have other countries recognize its so-called "rights." Although Germany and Italy may recognize these "rights," the US government will continue to promote the policy advocated by former Secretary of State Stimson, refusing to recognize accomplished facts. The US government authorities are aware that there are two ways to prevent Japan's attempt to establish hegemony in all of China: (1) China's vast territory will cause Japan major difficulties; (2) The major Western powers can cooperate to provide more active assistance to China and cut off Japan's supplies, which is almost equivalent to economic sanctions, a serious measure that could lead to war. World countries and US public opinion may not easily agree to take this risk. (Havas, 31st) Regarding the preservation of the Nine-Power Treaty, the US government has sent a note to Japan. Local newspapers have commented that the note is firm in tone. The New York Times stated, "US policy toward Japan is based on the theory of non-recognition of accomplished facts. This theory was advocated by former Secretary of State Stimson during the Manchurian Incident and was also applied to the Abyssinian question." The New York World-Telegram stated, "If the world bargains with these people (referring to the Japanese) and makes concessions to them, hoping for a reasonable response, it will only invite contempt and insults. To preserve our dignity, the only negotiation we should have with Japan is a solemn warning, stating that we will wait for an appropriate opportunity to demand compensation for damages." (Havas dispatch, 31st)

(London) According to Reuters diplomatic sources, the United States' recent note to Japan, which clearly refuses to recognize Japan's creation of a new order in China, has attracted great attention in London. The issue of British interests in China has been discussed informally by the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, Arita. Therefore, Britain is currently unlikely to send a note to Japan. Although there has been no official criticism of this US note, observers generally believe that Washington's approach and the US's arguments closely match London's views and feelings. Responsible sources in Washington have indicated that this will be the last US note on the China issue. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

### Soviet Newspaper Comments on Konoe Declaration: Aims to Test the Attitude of Wavering Elements in China; China's Determined Resistance Foils Konoe's Plan

(Moscow) The Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, recently commented on the declaration issued by Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on the 22nd of this month, stating that this declaration is primarily intended to conceal Japan's imperialist annexation plan. Undoubtedly, it also reveals the country's fear of the future of the war. The intention of this move is to test the attitude of wavering elements in China and whether peace is possible. However, after General Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of China, delivered a speech on the 26th of this month, stating that the country has decided to continue the war of resistance until final victory, this strategy has already failed. Japan's war against China was originally intended to exclude the interests of all countries in China. The Konoe Declaration is also aimed at all countries, brazenly expressing the desire to abolish the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by all countries in China, so that Japan will become the sole master after conquering China. Its request to station troops in China under the pretext of opposing the Comintern is ill-intentioned and inconsistent, and its true nature is already clearly revealed. Perhaps it is because Japan's offensive power has been weakened to this point that the country's warlords are forced to resort to deceptive tactics, saying that they want to reach a mutual "understanding" with China based on the lowest possible conditions, in order to weaken China's anti-Japanese front. The insidious nature of this scheme is evident. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 31st)

### Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in Central China, Shiroku Hata, Severely Wounded: Shot by Chinese Air Force Near Yueyang; Sent to Nanjing for Treatment, Doihara Visits Him

Local news: Shiroku Hata, Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in Central China, was severely wounded in the left ribs by machine-gun fire from the Chinese Air Force near Yueyang last week. He was traveling from Wuhan by car to Yueyang to command military operations when he was shot and wounded near the outskirts of Yueyang by the Chinese Air Force. He was immediately sent to Nanjing for treatment. Doihara visited him.

### Stalemate in Northern Section of Yuehan Railway

Changde: According to reports from the front, the fighting in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway has been extremely quiet in recent days. There have been no reports of fighting anywhere. (Dispatch, 1st)

### Japanese Troops Ambushed Near Tongcheng

Pingjiang: At 4:00 PM on the 29th, over 700 Japanese troops from the Beitashapingkou force in Tongcheng suddenly moved towards Miaopu. After being detected by a Chinese guerrilla unit, they were ambushed halfway. After an intense battle lasting over an hour, over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed and a heavy artillery piece was destroyed. The Chinese side suffered only 18 casualties. As the year drew to a close in the cold weather, the news of this victory greatly inspired the soldiers and civilians on the front lines. (31st)

### National Government Orders: Reiterate Strict Handling of Traitors; Those Truly Forced Are Allowed to Reform; Those Who Remain Obstinate Will Be Severely Punished According to Law

(Chongqing) The National Government issued a clear order on the 1st to strictly handle traitors. The telegram read: Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the military and civilians of the entire country have been united in their hatred of the enemy, taking the nation and the people as their priority, firmly resisting, and determined not to change. However, there are a few deranged individuals who are willing to be used by the enemy, to be servile and to act as accomplices, which is truly hateful. The government has previously ordered the Military Affairs Commission to investigate and arrest those who participated in puppet organizations in various regions, and to punish them severely according to law, and has also promulgated the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, clearly defining the penal provisions for various acts of collusion with the enemy, ordering its implementation to eliminate traitors. Now that the war situation is turning in our favor, the enemy's plots are emerging endlessly. If we do not eliminate and root out such elements, how can we encourage the masses? Therefore, we reiterate the laws and regulations and make them known to all. All those who have participated in illegal organizations in the northern and southern provinces, except for those who were truly forced and are willing to reform and repent, will be allowed to rehabilitate themselves and be exempted from punishment. However, if there are national traitors who are still obstinate, either holding positions in puppet regimes or secretly acting as traitors, daring to defy the world, and being abandoned by all Chinese people, then they are outside the pale and their crimes are unforgivable. The Military Affairs Commission shall be responsible for conducting a thorough investigation, strictly arresting and punishing them in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, in order to uphold the law and satisfy the people's hearts. This order. (Dispatch, 1st)

### Chairman's Speech (Continued from Yesterday): Delivered at the Chongqing New Life Movement Advancement Association on New Year's Eve

(Chongqing) Our year and a half of resistance war has been able to become more courageous after each setback, unyielding and indomitable. We have been able to continue to persevere and deal with the enemy. The effectiveness of the New Life Movement has undoubtedly had a very important influence. However, some people who do not fully understand the entire content of the New Life Movement often mistakenly believe that the New Life Movement does not have clear instructions for entertainment, thinking that a person's life, if tense all day long without any adjustment, will inevitably be dull and uninteresting, and believing that this is a major shortcoming. Little do they know that the New Life Movement fundamentally does not prohibit proper entertainment, and its so-called artistic meaning inherently includes entertainment. However, this interpretation of entertainment is limited to what is beneficial to the body and mind and beneficial to society, and it seeks to incorporate the role of education and cultivate moral behavior from entertainment. It is naturally absolutely different from the general social entertainment that is dedicated to gambling, wandering, dancing, drinking, and so on. It is important to know that these behaviors are completely degenerate behaviors of indulgence and dissipation, which not only damage the individual's physical and mental health but will also affect the cause of the country and society. For example, if an official is obsessed with prostitution and gambling, he will inevitably neglect his duties, will inevitably be extravagant, waste precious time, and wear down his personal ambitions. Therefore, corruption, incompetence, and various abuses will all arise in connection with each other. Also, if a person is obsessed with prostitution and gambling, he will inevitably abandon production, suffer losses, and even commit crimes and disrupt discipline, becoming a scourge of society. Everyone can understand this principle, but there are many people who deliberately ignore it, indulging and refusing to turn back, and even forcibly try to explain that this is personal private morality, an occasional pastime that does not harm the overall situation. May I ask, how can we call this kind of behavior harmless private entertainment? The words "occasional pastime" are the root cause of bad habits in individuals and bad customs in society. The Book of Rites has a few words: "If likes and dislikes have no moderation within, and knowledge is induced from without, and one cannot reflect on oneself, then the principles of Heaven are destroyed. If the principles of Heaven are destroyed and human desires are exhausted, then there will be rebellious feelings and licentious acts of disorder. This is the way to great chaos." The current kind of bad entertainment is precisely the origin of destroying the principles of Heaven, exhausting human desires, and not being able to reflect on oneself. The invasion of our national culture is due to our people mistakenly regarding this kind of degenerate behavior as entertainment life, so that they indulge in depravity and do whatever they want. Is this not one of the root causes of our illness? Moreover, to take a step back, these entertainments, apart from being confused and chaotic and losing reason at the time, will inevitably cause mental pain and unbearable remorse once things change. There is no slightest pleasure and it is fundamentally contrary to the original meaning of happiness. Therefore, in the New Life Movement, these behaviors are identified as not entertainment, not personal private morality, and must be fundamentally eradicated and cleared away. I have recently issued an order to party, government, military, and public servants, banning it strictly. We want national rejuvenation. On the one hand, we must thoroughly implement the prohibition of opium; at the same time, we must thoroughly eliminate the evil habit of gambling. We sincerely hope that comrades and compatriots across the country will unite in reflection, self-awareness and others, and self-encouragement and encouragement of others, and jointly shoulder the responsibility of changing customs. Our nation has hope for continued revival. Comrades in Chongqing are particularly encouraged because their examples are emulated by the entire country, to do excellent job and be a model for all parts of the country. But that being said, what exactly is the entertainment of the New Life Movement? It should be known that the essence of entertainment, the essential condition, is that after doing it, it can regulate the fatigue of our day's work, promote our positive spirit, and create a happy mind. Confucius once said a phrase, "Play in the arts." Although the meaning is simple, it is the most reasonable entertainment life. This word "art" refers to the six things that the ancients called the great arts: rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic. The ancients used this to educate the people, and at the same time, they used it as people's entertainment life. You see how meaningful this entertainment method of our ancestors is! Therefore, in the conclusion of the New Life Movement Outline, there are two sentences: "The six arts of ancient China: rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic are now precisely the main arts for building a nation in the Eastern and Western powers." It can be seen that the entertainment that the New Life Movement wants to promote has long been proposed. Just talking about music, the music that anyone can do is now music radio, gramophone, collective singing meetings, and various concerts. As long as the content is proper, it is enough to cultivate the body and mind. Archery and horsemanship are equivalent to various sports now. Young people can participate in various ball games, races, skating, and swimming. Older people can also practice various gymnastics and national arts. As for travel and picnics, they can also be held appropriately. Writing and arithmetic are naturally academic research, and there is no difference between ancient and modern times. Things like chess, calligraphy, and painting are naturally also within the scope of writing and arithmetic entertainment. And the modern and foreign books are enough to cultivate the temperament, increase knowledge, and the benefits are endless. You can choose what you like and you can always gather colleagues or friends to read, study, exchange ideas, and discuss with each other to increase mutual interest. These entertainment methods can be held anytime, anywhere by individuals and families, either to please the eyes and ears, strengthen the body, or increase knowledge. At the time, it is of course physically and mentally pleasant, and afterwards, it can cultivate the foundation of a career. There are a hundred benefits and no harm. Why don't we do it? There is a most popular saying in society now, "Entertainment does not forget to save the country." It must be this kind of entertainment to be considered not contrary to the true meaning of saving the country. Our current national unanimous hope is concentrated on the two goals of winning the war of resistance and building the country. However, our current situation is still very dangerous. The great disaster of national subjugation and extinction is still pressing on our eyes. To break through this disaster, crush the enemy's oppression, and complete the mission of resisting the war and building the country, in addition to our 450 million compatriots across the country being of one heart and one mind, strengthening human and material resources through a difficult and arduous life, there is no other way. We must be consistent across the country, to achieve a state of no useless people, no wasted time, no wasted land, no wasted materials, so that we can fully strengthen human and material resources to compare with the enemy, to have hope for long-term control of the enemy and strive for final victory. At the same time, we must also know that after our victory in the war of resistance, the country will have undergone an unprecedented destruction after this great calamity, and all civil construction will have been destroyed as never before. At that time, the difficulties will inevitably be more serious than during the war. We should make up our minds early and be particularly frugal so that the future construction of the country can be successful. Therefore, our entertainment must recognize this serious meaning, not only to resolutely reject the entertainment that consumes time, energy, and materials, but also to actively pay attention to all proper entertainment for men, women, old, and young, on the one hand to inspire everyone's spirit, but also to increase the total power of creation and production, and must make it closely related to the future of the war of resistance and national construction, and must not allow any wasteful influence. Tomorrow is the New Year's Day of the 28th year, I warmly hope that our compatriots will cheer up, innovate their lives, and make all past bad habits fundamentally erased with this year's New Year's Eve, and a neat, lively, active, and forward-looking rational life will flourish from tomorrow's New Year's Day, achieving the consolidation of the national foundation and the enrichment of people's lives through changing customs, realizing the Three Principles of the People and completing the National Revolution. I take this opportunity to wish the comrades present and the compatriots across the country a happy new year. (Dispatch, 31st)

### The Degree of Cooperation Between Britain and the United States is Astonishing

Melbourne The U.S. Consul General in Melbourne, Ford, stated yesterday at a university graduation banquet, "If I could inform you of the degree of cooperation between Britain and the United States, it would certainly astonish you.

### Weather Forecast for 1939: The Far East and the Mediterranean Still the Two Major World Problems, Central European Problem Already Resolved by Germany, German and Italian Newspapers Use Alarming Language Again

(Berlin) On New Year's Eve, German newspapers commented on the strength of the German military and the confusion of Britain. The Berlin Borsen Zeitung published a threatening article, stating that by the end of 1939, the Central European problem had been resolved according to German methods. Germany has occupied an initiating position in world politics. Britain values the friendship of world Jews more than the friendship of Germany, which is very regrettable. The colonial issue could have been resolved through British-German compromise, but it was shelved due to pro-Jewish sentiments. The eight or ninety million people of Germany now stand at the entrance of a great future, and are the largest group among the white race. The Mediterranean and the Far East are still the two major problems in world politics in the new year. Domination of the Mediterranean will undoubtedly be a major event in 1939. (1st Reuters dispatch)

(Rome) The Italian Popolo d'Italia recently stated that recognizing the dominance of the German-Italian axis in Central and Eastern Europe, and at the same time recognizing its dominance in the Mediterranean, is one of the conditions for maintaining European peace. "At this point, the future of Europe depends on the actions of the German-Italian axis and the resistance of other countries. This situation is more certain than in the past. The future development of the situation will take one of two paths: Resistance will eventually turn into understanding. If so, we can use peaceful means to transform the current situation in Central Europe and the Mediterranean, with Germany and Italy taking the dominant position. If this resistance is unreasonable, then the future of Europe will definitely face extremely serious difficulties." (1st Havas dispatch)

(Paris) The entire diplomatic corps paid a New Year's visit to President Lebrun this morning. The Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Valerio Valeri, as the leader of the diplomatic corps, delivered a speech, briefly stating that 1938 was extremely important in history. "At one point, the catastrophe of war was about to descend. Fortunately, people of noble will cooperated and rescued us, preventing the bankruptcy of our millennia-old culture, and preserving the glory and beauty of the continent we inhabit. As we bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, we deeply hope that peace will continue to be maintained in the coming year, and that all countries can move forward on the path of understanding and cooperation." As for France, it has made many efforts for the ideals of justice and peace, which is admirable. President Lebrun immediately replied, "I hope that in the coming year, all places where peace can be preserved will remain peaceful, and that other places that have suffered the devastation of war for several months will also be able to restore peace." France will work enthusiastically for the rapprochement of all nations, and deeply hopes that all governments will also show the same sincerity. (31st Havas dispatch)

(Budapest) Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky is scheduled to publish a New Year's message in the semi-official Hungarian newspaper, Pester Lloyd, tomorrow. He said, "We have a full understanding of the signs of the times, and we know that to maintain confidence, we must constantly issue public statements. Everyone knows the meaning of the Anti-Comintern Pact very well. We also felt the decline of the League of Nations more than a decade ago. World public opinion is now divided into two camps centered on two different ideologies. No one can support both ideologies with the same confidence. This is also something we deeply understand." In terms of diplomacy, we acknowledge Germany's rights in Central Europe. Our friendship with Poland has a solid foundation, and our long-standing friendship with Yugoslavia was further strengthened during the tense situation in September this year. As for our two neighboring countries, Romania and Czechoslovakia, the evolution of our relations with them will depend on the treatment of the Hungarian minorities within their borders. Our rapprochement with Germany and Italy is not intended to oppose the major powers of Western Europe. "All veterans oppose a new war. This is undoubtedly true." Some quarters have commented on the Foreign Minister's article, generally asking whether Hungary is preparing to withdraw from the League of Nations. (31st Havas dispatch)

(Barcelona) Republican Prime Minister Negrín took the opportunity of New Year's Day to deliver a radio speech to all countries in the world, especially the countries of South America, briefly stating that the civil war that has occurred within Spain is related to the future of all countries. Its significance lies in proving whether countries will be governed by violence or international law in the future, and whether the world will be controlled by omnipotent countries or democratic countries. It is still possible to reverse the situation, but the crisis is widespread and cannot be delayed any longer. At this point, countries can face each other in battle without declaring war. In the case of Spain, although the civil war was initially caused by a military rebellion, in reality there was an attempt by Germany and Italy to expand their influence. These acts of aggression have caused us great suffering, but the ignorance of right and wrong on the part of our friendly and neutral countries has been even more harmful. The enemy will use this situation to slander us. They falsely accuse us of being influenced by the Bolsheviks. In fact, on the day the civil war broke out in our country in July 1936, Spain was the only country in Europe that had not established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The claim of being influenced by them can be refuted without argument. In short, although we have suffered greatly, we are still fully confident that we will achieve a final victory for the independence of our country, the freedom of mankind, and the principles of democracy."

### Daladier Goes to Dependencies, Declares No Surrender of an Inch of Land

(Paris) Prime Minister Daladier departed for Corsica at 12:00 noon today for an inspection tour. The Prime Minister was originally scheduled to depart this morning with Navy Minister Campinchi, Army Chief of Staff General Georges, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Vuillemin. However, due to the debate in the Chamber of Deputies on the 1939 budget, the Prime Minister had to attend in person, thus delaying the trip. The train is expected to arrive at Toulon at 10:15 p.m., and then board the cruiser "Foch" at 11:00 p.m. to go to the capital of Corsica. (1st Havas dispatch)

(Paris) French Navy Minister Campinchi left Paris for Toulon before 9:00 p.m. last night and will board the cruiser "Suffren" today to set sail for Corsica to await Daladier's arrival on the island. (1st Reuter dispatch)

(Paris) Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier delivered a speech at the meeting of the Radical Socialist Party's parliamentary group today, solemnly declaring that France will never cede an inch of land to other countries. When inspecting Corsica and the Tunisian Protectorate in North Africa in the coming days, he will also deliver a speech explaining France's firm policy. According to Foreign Minister Bonnet, who stated in a speech to the Chamber of Deputies on the 19th of this month, "France will never cede an inch of land to Italy. Any attempt to seize French territory will definitely lead to war. The Tunisian Protectorate, Corsica, Savoy, and French Somaliland in East Africa are all French territories without distinction."

### Spain: Intense Fighting, Conflicting News from Both Sides

Barcelona: Last night, the Spanish Republican Army's war report stated that the Nationalist Army, advancing along Seros, was exerting strong pressure and continuing to advance. The fighting in and around Seras was particularly fierce. The Nationalist Army received assistance from aircraft, artillery, and tanks. The Republican Army could only resist bravely. In Corcubión, they repelled two attacks by strong enemies. After heavy casualties, the Nationalist Army captured Hill 429. The Republican Army immediately launched a counterattack and recaptured the hill. The attacking enemy forces at other locations also suffered heavy casualties. Republican aircraft dropped bombs on enemy concentration areas, which were quite accurate. One enemy plane was shot down. On the 30th night, Republican fighter planes shot down attacking enemy planes over the coastal city of Southern Catalonia, with no survivors among the four on board. Yesterday morning, enemy planes bombed the port of Valencia, and Barcelona was subjected to four air raids yesterday. (1st Reuter dispatch)

Salamanca: The headquarters of the Spanish Nationalist Army declared that Barcelona's report that the Republican Army's counterattack south of Lérida was quite successful did not correspond to the facts. In fact, the Republican Army on the Catalan front was only retreating, not counterattacking. The Nationalist Army advanced with amazing speed, and the Republican Army in Cervera was caught off guard and could only surrender. (1st Reuter dispatch)

Barcelona: Yesterday, as Nationalist planes were flying overhead and anti-aircraft guns were firing below, a detachment of the Spanish Presidential Guard protected the newly appointed French Ambassador to Barcelona, Henri, to attend an official banquet. During this air raid, five people were killed and nine were injured. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Valencia: The British ship "Mitrobnello" narrowly escaped serious damage during an attack by Nationalist planes yesterday. This was the third time this week that the ship had narrowly escaped being bombed. Nationalist planes dropped more than 50 bombs in the port, and shrapnel hit the ship. (1st Reuters dispatch)

### Current State of British and German Navies: Germany Builds Small Submarines, Power Exceeds Britain's by Double

(London) The Times naval correspondent wrote an article on the British-German naval talks, saying that one situation is particularly noteworthy, that is, if Germany builds small submarines, its submarine power may exceed Britain's by more than double. The number of German submarines is currently greater than that of Britain, with 72 compared to 69. However, their tonnage is only 45% of that of British submarines, because German submarines are purely for coastal use and are all small. British submarines need to go to any part of the world, so larger ones are more suitable. (1st Reuters dispatch)

(Berlin) The British-German naval talks have ended yesterday. It is said that Germany will build submarines as amazing as those during the Great War. According to observers, Germany will build 130 new submarines. During the Great War, Germany had a total of 140 submarines. (1st AP dispatch)

(London) According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, regarding Germany's request to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain, although no official news is available here after the British and German representatives met in Berlin, it seems that there is no reason to speculate that Germany will change its intentions. Vice Admiral Cunningham, the leader of the British delegation to Germany, returned to London by plane yesterday and will prepare a report on the Berlin talks and submit it to the British Foreign Office. It is reported that this report will be sent to Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, who are currently on vacation in Nairnshire. It is heard that the British government questioned Germany's reasons for wanting to build more submarines during the meeting. (1st Reuters dispatch)

(London) Regarding Germany's request, based on the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, to increase its submarine tonnage to be equal to that of British submarines, after the British Admiralty delegation went to Berlin to hold talks with German naval representatives, well-informed sources here recently declared that the British delegation's trip failed to persuade Germany to change its original intention. However, based on unconfirmed news, it is possible that the country has made concessions in terms of construction deadlines and styles. In addition, the German government, in accordance with the guarantee clauses contained in the 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, requested to increase the number of 10,000-ton cruisers (with 8-inch guns) allowed to be built from five to seven. This request was made on the pretext that the Soviet government had added first-class cruisers, but failed to provide concrete evidence. According to the 1936 Anglo-French-American naval treaty, it is not allowed to build 10,000-ton cruisers. However, because certain countries have already built many such cruisers, other countries are allowed to build them in moderation. For example, Germany and the Soviet Union can each build five. (31st Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) After the German government submitted a note to Britain on the 19th of this month, advocating that the tonnage of German submarines be increased to be equal to that of British submarines in accordance with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 18, 1935, the British government immediately dispatched a naval delegation led by Vice Admiral Cunningham to come here for consultations. The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating, "After the British Admiralty delegation arrived here on the 29th of this month, it held talks with German naval representatives yesterday in a very friendly spirit. The two sides explained their views separately on various issues arising from the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement (regarding quantitative restrictions) and the 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement (regarding qualitative restrictions). The German government will then submit a written note to the British government based on the results of this talk. The British Admiralty delegation returned to London today." According to well-informed sources, in addition to expressing its desire to increase the tonnage of submarines to be equal to that of British submarines, the German representative brought up the issue of the caliber of the guns on first-class cruisers for discussion. As for the strength of Germany's existing submarine fleet, according to the Naval Yearbook, from 1935 to 1937, the various classes of submarines that have been launched include ten of 5,000 tons, two of 712 tons, and twenty-four of 250 tons. Those currently under construction include six of 250 tons, eleven of 547 tons, and eight of 740 tons. (31st Havas dispatch)

### Roosevelt Orders: Fixed Domestic Silver Price, 64.6 Cents Per Ounce; Foreign Silver Price to Be Determined at Any Time

(Washington) President Roosevelt ordered today that the Treasury Department will continue to purchase newly mined silver at a price of 64.64 cents per ounce for the next six months. This is the method recommended by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. At the same time, the silver group in Congress is also opposed to lowering the price of silver and intends to introduce a new bill in Congress within six months. As for the purchase of silver from abroad, the current market price of 43 cents per ounce will still be maintained. (31st AP dispatch)

(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an order today stipulating that the government can still purchase domestically produced silver at a price of 64 cents per ounce until June 30, 1939. The actual price of American silver is slightly more than $1.28 per ounce. The amount of silver in storage as of November 30, 1938, was 2,524,000,000 ounces, worth a total of $3,236,000,000. The method of purchasing silver from foreign countries was not specified and will be determined at any time by the financial authorities 24 hours in advance. Regarding monetary and financial issues, Congress granted President Roosevelt special powers in 1933, allowing him to devalue the dollar to a certain extent and establish an exchange equalization fund. This power is scheduled to expire on June 30, 1939. (31st Havas dispatch)

### Syria Warns France: Must Allow Independence; Syrian Prime Minister Expresses Firm Stance; All Members of Parliament Express Approval

Damascus: The treaty signed between France and the Syrian Republic on September 9, 1936, stipulated that France should relinquish its rule and allow Syria to become an independent country after three years. Since the Foreign Affairs Committees of the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies refused to ratify this treaty, the Chamber of Deputies of the Syrian Republic discussed it this afternoon. Shukri al-Quwatli, the leader of the Nationalist Party, immediately demanded that the Syrian government immediately announce that the transitional period stipulated in the French-Syrian treaty had expired, and that it would reclaim its political power and declare independence. Prime Minister Mardam followed with a speech, saying that the treaty had been rejected by France. There is nothing to report in detail about my trip to France. This approach of the French government is quite inappropriate. I warned the authorities of the French Foreign Ministry that if this treaty is not ratified, serious consequences will follow. The French government will then send another investigation team to Syria. At that time, the Chamber of Deputies and the government will not be willing to negotiate with them. "It is true that Syria must maintain friendship with France. However, if France breaks its promise, we will use all means to defend ourselves, even sacrificing our lives and property to seek independence." The Chamber of Deputies then unanimously passed a motion expressing its approval of the policies pursued by Mardam. The discussion was very heated. (31st Havas dispatch)

Beirut: The Syrian Parliament met yesterday to debate the issue of the new Franco-Syrian agreement. Before the meeting, thousands of students marched in the streets of Damascus, demanding that Syria be declared independent. Although there were several clashes between the marchers and the police, fortunately there were no serious injuries and no major disasters occurred. (1st Reuter dispatch)

### British Technician Convicted by Russian Authorities: Flying into the Country Without a License

(Moscow) After the Moscow Civil Court opened a trial the other day on the case of British technician Galloway, who flew into Soviet territory without the permission of the Soviet authorities, it was announced today that the defendant Galloway was convicted of sneaking into the country and fined 1,500 rubles. If he is unable to pay, he will be sentenced to one month of detention and his plane will be confiscated. Galloway had worked in a Soviet oil mine for many years and married a Soviet woman. Since he left alone in 1934, he has been eager to return to the Soviet Union to visit his wife, but he was unable to obtain a permit at the Soviet Consulate. Therefore, he bought a single-engine plane in the Swedish capital and flew through the capital of Finland, landing in Leningrad, Soviet Union, on the 13th of last month. Local police immediately arrested him because he did not have an entry permit. He was then brought here. The Soviet judicial authorities, on the grounds that Galloway sneaked into the country, should have been severely punished in accordance with the law under the charges of "espionage" or "counter-revolutionary activities." In view of his true motive, which is the love of his family, and there is no other intention, the sentence has been mitigated. (31st Havas dispatch)

### This Year's Guizhou Province's Policy Guidelines Under the Leadership and Supervision of the Central Government, the War of Resistance and National Construction Proceed Simultaneously

Guiyang. Guizhou Province is the center of the rear area of the War of Resistance and the hub of the southwestern provinces. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a province with a shortage of financial resources has been burdened with arduous tasks. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the authorities in the past year, both politics and construction have made considerable progress. As the end of the year is approaching, a reporter specially visited Chairman Wu Dingchang to inquire about the work and policy guidelines for the year. Mr. Wu first humbly declined and then made the following statement: Since I came to Guizhou for a year, I have no significant performance to report and feel very guilty. Fortunately, with the guidance, support, and efforts of all sectors, various facilities have gradually been established. In terms of politics, the training of Baojia cadres has been completed and is being carried out for compilation and investigation, and more than ten cases of punishing corruption have been handled, banditry cleared up, and the ban on opium planting and smoking since the 26th year has been strictly enforced. Important political affairs such as conscription and corvée labor have also been completed on schedule. In terms of education, in addition to strictly militarizing it, popular education will be given priority to the public. Official governance is gradually entering a clear track. In terms of construction, cotton trials and silkworm improvements have been quite successful in agriculture. The plan to replace opium cultivation with wheat and rapeseed has also been implemented. The plan to afforest one million mu of land every year has also been put into practice. The number of county cooperative treasuries that have been decided to be established has reached more than thirty counties, and the rest are being planned. The provincial cooperative treasury will also be held soon. The rural financial institutions in the province have been completed, and production will surely increase year by year. This province has had good harvests in various places this year, and has legally handled the storage to make up for the amount that should have been stored in the 25th and 26th years. Provincial granaries have been established in five counties including Guiyang, and regulating offices have been established in nine counties including Qianxi. In addition, the Farmland Irrigation Loan Committee and the Agricultural Production Loan Committee are tasked with subsidizing people's production. As for transportation and sales, there are also special committees such as the Industry and Commerce Adjustment Committee and the Tung Oil Transportation and Sales Cooperative Committee to take charge of it, and actively transport and sell local special products to supplement national income. In total, 3.8 million yuan has been allocated for agricultural funds, and this will increase every year in the future. The development of agriculture should not be a problem. In terms of mining, coal mines and other mines have already raised sufficient funds and established companies, bureaus and offices to actively develop them. Cement plants are being planned. In terms of industry, in addition to local handicrafts, oil factories have been established, and flour factories, food factories, sugar factories, and the manufacture of chemical daily necessities are all being planned. In terms of transportation, it is urgently needed to be developed. In addition to the five major trunk roads in this province, ten trunk roads will be built one after another: (1) Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, Chiwei Section; (2) Xingjiang Highway from Xingren and Xingyi to Kunming; (3) Andu Highway (from Anmen via Baise, Guangxi to Longzhou); (4) Yusong Highway (from Yuping to Songtao); (5) Dingluo Highway (from Dingbian to Luodian Hongshui River); (6) Dusan Highway (from Duyun via Sanyue to Rongjiang); (7) Zunping Highway (from Zunyi to Pingyue Tongmachangping); (8) Zunsong Highway (from Zunyi via Sinan to Songtao); (9) Suirong Highway (from Sansui to Rongjiang); (10) Tongchi Highway (from Tongzi to Chishui or to Hejiang, Sichuan). In terms of railways, the Weizhu section is connected to the Sichuan-Yunnan trunk line, and the Ministry of Transportation has agreed to hold it first. The waterways are currently being surveyed and dredged by personnel sent by the central government. As for health construction, no less than 20 health institutes have been established, and epidemic prevention work has also been universally implemented. The rapid eradication of cholera this year has shown results. After Guangzhou and Wuhan successively retreated, the leader's letter to the people of the country clearly showed the people of the country that "the southwestern provinces will be the source of our War of Resistance." Therefore, in the future, under the leadership and supervision of the central government, the War of Resistance and national construction will proceed simultaneously. In the 28th year, because of expelling the enemy and recovering the lost land, the work is even more urgent, and the supply of manpower and materials is more important to the overall situation. This province is poor, and the material contributions are less than in other provinces. In the future, we should only make up for the lack of material resources with human resources. Therefore, we have decided to take "the first priority of military service in this year's work" as the slogan to handle military service with all our strength. Moreover, in order to ensure that the conscription is not lacking and not missed, Baojia must be sound, transportation must be convenient, soldiers must be strong, health administration must be universally promoted, and opium must be completely banned. Raising national awareness is an important part of military training. The way to improve shortcomings and cut out malpractices is to rectify the governance of the province, clear out remote bandits, and develop local resources. This is the outline of the policy guidelines for the 28th year of this province, which should be worked hard to carry out. (30th telegram)

### Huang Xuchu Published the Administration of Guangxi in the Past Year, Adhering to the Principle of Resistance and Construction, Striving to Achieve Anything Conducive to the Resistance

Guilin. Huang Xuchu published the administration of Guangxi in the past year, with more than 10,000 words. First, he stated that in the past year of the 27th year, this province has always adhered to the principle of resisting the war on the one hand and building on the other hand during this extraordinary period, bravely forging ahead, and concentrating all efforts and sacrificing everything to achieve anything that can enhance the strength of the war of resistance and meet the needs of the war of resistance, hoping to make up for the country. Although it is in the period of resistance, political expenses are stretched, but various regular political affairs and important constructions are still carried out step by step and in an orderly manner, without being stagnated due to the resistance. The progress of various constructions in the past year is unprecedented in any previous year. The reason why it can achieve such satisfactory results is partly due to the financial assistance of the central government and the cooperation of technical agencies, and partly due to the efforts of various experts and financial circles from outside. Secondly, a detailed explanation is given on personnel, administration, organization, local autonomy, local public security, health administration, rural political affairs, finance, accounting, auditing, agriculture, industry and commerce, mining, transportation, higher education, secondary education, national basic education, social education, and relief undertakings in the past year. Finally, statistics show that the province has been bombed more than 40 times in the past year. The bombed areas include Guilin, Cangwu, Liujiang, Guiping, Yongning, Wuming, Longjin, Baibao Huaiji, Hexian, Pingle, Yulin, Quanxian, Zhaoping and other 14 counties. Guilin and Cangwu counties were the worst bombed. The victims have been given relief in accordance with the regulations. It is expected that the enemy planes will attack this province more fiercely than in the past. However, the enemy planes can only destroy our property, but cannot eliminate our will to resist the war. On the contrary, their madness in bombing will make our people recognize the cruel face of the Communist Party and strengthen their determination to sacrifice and resist the war. Therefore, we are absolutely not afraid of their bombing, and we are always prepared for their bombing. However, our will will become stronger and stronger, and our determination to resist the war will become more and more firm. The enemy's use of such despicable means is only to show off their brutality and strengthen our resistance. Now, on the occasion of the New Year's Day, which coincides with the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy has already devoted its forces to attack our southwest. In the future, the position of this province will become more and more important militarily, and the tasks we shoulder will be even more difficult. On this day of serious national crisis, it is the time for us to sacrifice for the country. In the future, we should work harder, endure hardship, concentrate the manpower and financial resources of the province, and contribute to the country and the nation. With the greatest sacrifice, we will strive for the final victory. This is what we should work together with our fellow countrymen in the province. All sectors of the Party, government, military and police in Guangxi and various people's organizations will hold a New Year's Day military parade and group worship ceremony one day, and extensively comfort the wounded soldiers. The authorities have allocated 50,000 Gui coins to the consolation group to distribute to various counties. (1st telegram)

### The Yellow River Breach Has Not Been Blocked, and the Disaster Situation in Nine Counties in Northern Jiangsu Has Been Formed. Public and Private Groups Re-Telegram the Central Government for Help. The Provincial Government Hired Han Guojun to Form an Estuary Engineering Committee

Taixian Correspondence. The counties in the lower reaches of Jiangsu Province have been flooded by the Yellow River, which has seized the Huai River and flowed south, passing through Hongze, Gaobao, and Zhu Lakes, breaking through the eastern embankment of the Grand Canal, and flooding the nine counties of Gaoyou, Xinghua, Taixian, Yancheng, Dongtai, Funing, Huaian, Baoying, and Jiangdu, entering the sea. The fertile land of the east of the Grand Canal has suddenly become a country of swamps. After the frost, the Yellow River has continued to rise again and again. Without waiting for next spring, the lowest counties will continue to stage the tragedy of the water flooding Sizhou. Public and private groups in various counties have telegraphed the central government and the provincial government to appeal for help and try to salvage the situation. The latest situation is recorded as follows:

Planning of the Estuary Waterway Engineering Project

The southward breach of the Yellow River extends to several provinces, with eastern Henan and northern Anhui bearing the brunt, and northern Jiangsu being the last. To save this situation, we must first block the two breaches of Huayuankou and Zhaokou to restore the Yellow River to its original course. This is the best policy. Consolidate the Honghu Dam, block and build the Sanhe Caoba and the two dams of Chexin on the Grand Canal, and deepen the Zhangfu Diversion River to force the water to wash the Zhongshan River (ie, the new river of the Guai River) into the sea through the Yangzhuang Activity Dam. This is the middle policy. If the upper and middle policies are not implemented, only the shallow waters downstream of the ports entering the sea will be dredged to increase the drainage capacity, and the continued rise of the Yellow River next spring will not be asked. This is the lower policy. However, the central government must design and construct the blockage of the Yellow River breach. The Sanhe Caoba has a mouth of 800 zhang (Chinese feet), and it is not easy to block. The two dams of Chexin must also wait until the water level drops to within one zhang before construction can be carried out. The only project that can be implemented at present is the ports entering the sea. According to the investigation, the six ports entering the sea (1) Sheyang Port in the east of Funing County, (2) Xinyang Port in the east of Yancheng County, (3) Doulong Port, (4) Wangjia Port, (5) Zhu Port, (6) Dongchuan Port (the above four ports belong to Dongtai) are mostly silted and have many bends, so the drainage is not smooth. The reporter once traveled to the lower reaches of Sheyang Port. The land journey is only six li apart, but the water journey is more than thirty li. Its winding can be known. As far as dredging the ports entering the sea is concerned, there are several things that should be constructed: (1) To the south of Sheyang Port, there is Huangsha Port, which was initiated and built by Ma Yuren. The completed section is more than 70 li long, indirectly connecting to Sheyang Port. Extending it by another 20 li can enter the sea independently. (2) The Xinyang Port dredging project. (3) To the east of Wuyou Port, there is the Xicao River that can lead to the sea, which needs to be opened and dredged. (4) The second Mao You River needs to be extended eastward to connect Wangjia Port and enter the sea. (5) The mouths of Doulong Port, Wangjia Port, Zhu Port, and Dongchuan Port have been building sluice gates since the 20th year of the Republic of China, which can be opened and closed freely. They were originally built to drain freshwater and prevent tidal brine. Each gate has nine holes, each hole is about 2.65 feet. The project cost about 300,000 yuan for each. However, due to poor management and insufficient gate maintenance costs, they have gradually lost their effectiveness in less than ten years. The gate is rusted in the water and cannot be raised. The gate holes on both sides of the gate below Ming (Doulong Port) are particularly bad and must be repaired. Chuanzhen River runs through the north and south, and is a major canal in eastern Jiangsu. Its east is the famous Fan Gong Dam, which used to prevent sea tides, but now it hinders the water from flowing east. More culverts should be opened to facilitate drainage. According to experts, this project requires at least one million yuan to be held.

The Jiangsu Provincial Government Organized an Estuary Engineering Committee

The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently telegraphed Han Guojun to organize an Estuary Engineering Committee. The telegram read (omitted above) Investigation this year's festival is approaching heavy snow, lake and river water does not disappear, fertile fields are still in swamp, wheat has already been hopeless, if there is another error in spring plowing, then how will the people live, have telegraphed the central government to quickly seek a way to block the mouth, and ordered the Transportation Engineering Bureau to vigorously seek a way to return to the Yangtze River, now intend to organize the Lixiahe Estuary Waterway Engineering Committee, and hire Mr. Wu Xiafeng, Director Shen Baozhen, as deputy directors, respectfully invite you to serve as the director, in addition to sending separate telegrams, corresponding telegrams reached, immediately hope to find a location together, organize the establishment, plan and proceed, so as to early 淡沉 the disaster, is what is expected, and hope to reply the handling situation by telegram, Acting Chairman Han Deqin Yang Jianyin,

Gentry from Various Counties Re-Telegrammed the Central Government for Help

After receiving the telegram, Han Guojun regarded the organization of the Estuary Engineering Committee as important and replied in a telegram hoping to establish and construct early. However, in the telegram of resigning from the position of director, there were words such as "Jun is in declining health and the position of director is really difficult to overcome this complexity." However, the provincial government believes that Han hosted the canal embankment restoration project during the 20th year of the flood, and the achievements were remarkable. Han is the only one who can be the director. Another telegram urged him to take office. On December 17th, Han invited Wu Tongju, Shen Baozhen, Wang Yuanyi, Wang Youshan, Hu Xianbo, Bao Mingshu, etc., to exchange opinions at the Han residence in Hai'an. For the overall engineering, a brief study was conducted, thinking that the waterway into the sea is only a lower policy to reduce the Yellow River disaster. Tracing back to the root, it is still necessary to block the Yellow River breach in the upper reaches. Special telegrams were sent to the central government and to fellow villagers in Sichuan, Huang Renzhi, Leng Yuqiu, Jiang Wenyu, and the former Jiangsu Provincial authorities, Chen Guofu, Niu Tisheng, Ye Chucang, Yu Jingtang, etc., requesting the government to quickly plan to block the breach. The telegrams were roughly the same. Here is a copy of the telegram sent to Huang, Leng and Jiang: (omitted above) Recently, a telegram was sent to the National Government and the Executive Yuan saying, "Since the Yellow River breached from Huayuankou and Zhaokou, it has seized the Huai River and entered Jiangsu. Its water goes straight to Hongze, east irrigates Gaobao, and then passes through the Grand Canal to the east, injecting into the lower reaches of the river. The source is extremely strong and the drainage is not timely. The nine counties of Huaiyang have suddenly become a country of swamps, with a water area of tens of thousands of square miles, and the water depth on the flat ground is several feet. Since the frost, the water has spread and not only does not recede, but also increases. This has never happened before. If the winter is like this, what can we imagine if there are three floods next year? The ports returning to the sea were originally the outlet of the Huai River, but now they are combined with the water of the Yellow River of thousands of miles, which is difficult to bear. In addition, the sea tide is supporting the top, and the amount of discharge is less and less. According to this situation, the wheat has been delayed, and rice will be hopeless. The fundamental plan is to cut off the source of water, which is not enough to stop the catastrophe and 淡沉 the disaster. Please send a senior official to quickly plan to block the breach. Because of the situation at that time, there may be obstacles. Please also refer to the previous telegram and ask the International Engineering Corps to borrow chopsticks to plan and start construction as soon as possible to comfort the people of northern Jiangsu. Urgent telegrams are waiting for orders, etc. Previously, Mr. Zheng Boquan was not telegraphed, and no reply has been received yet. Please call 一致 to save northern Jiangsu, and hope to reply by telegram, Han Guojun, Wang Baohuai, Ma Shijie, Xia Yinguan, Shi Mingyong, Chen Bomeng, Zhang Yanshou, Bao Youke, Bao Sui, Tian Yufan bowed.

### The Focus of the Guangdong War Remains on the West River: Japanese Troops Actively Reinforcing the West River; Chinese Troops on the East River Open the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Line; The Impetus of Japanese Naval Vessels on the Southern Route Subsides

A telegram from Zhaoqing: The Japanese troops on the West River have been actively carrying out their plan to covet Cangwu. From the 14th, Japanese troops stationed in Guangzhou have been continuously dispatched to Hekou as reinforcements. On the evening of the 15th, two Japanese military vehicles departed from Shiwetang, carrying four to five hundred soldiers and twenty artillery pieces, arriving in Hekou in the early morning of the 16th. On the same day, over two thousand Japanese soldiers also arrived. It is estimated that in the past few days, several thousand troops have been added, stationed in Makou, Mafang, and other locations. At the same time, Japanese troops between Foshan and Jiujiang have also been increasing, apparently redeploying on both the north and south banks of the West River. The focus of future battles will likely remain in the West River area. After the Japanese troops on the Yuehan Railway line were severely defeated by the Chinese army, it was difficult to advance north along the railway. Therefore, they changed their strategy to defend the north and attack the west, using Conghua, Sanshui, and Jiujiang as three important strongholds: (1) From Conghua, they attempted to attack Juntian westward and seize Yinzhanao; (2) From Sanshui, they concentrated their main force to attack Zhaoqing, but because the Chinese side had already stationed heavy troops upstream and was defended in conjunction with the river defense fleet, and the Lingyang Gorge and Zhaoqing Gorge near Zhaoqing were strategically important and the water flow was rapid in this cold winter, which was more conducive to defense, the Japanese army avoided the main points and chose to advance along the Xiaobei River to occupy Lubao, attacking Zhaoqing from the rear, and divided their troops into two routes: one crossed Guanyao and advanced towards Juntian, in order to establish close contact with the Japanese troops in northern Guangdong, and at the same time actively engaged in attacking the guerrillas scattered in the triangular area between Juntian, Lubao, and Sanshui, in order to wait for an opportunity to attack, and also to launch attacks from Lubao to cut off the Chinese army's military communication between Qingyuan and Sihui; the other went south along the south bank of the river from Dongmakou to reach the border of Gaoyao County; (3) The Japanese troops in Jiujiang attacked Heshan, suppressing the guerrillas in that area. Their main purpose was to advance westward along Gulao and Sanzhou, employing a roundabout strategy with the Japanese troops going south from Dongmakou to jointly attack Zhaoqing, and then attack Wu to enter Guangxi. This is the general situation of the Japanese army's invasion of the West River.

Recently, the Japanese army, realizing that the Chinese army has transferred strong forces to defend key points and that it is not easy to succeed, has changed its strategy to defensive. Therefore, they have been rushing to build defensive works in Makou, Hekou, Sigong, Jiaokou, Dalu Market, and other places, and have erected several small steel cannons at Mumian Gang and Maoer Gang near Mafang to prevent Chinese counterattacks. In the past few days, they have been bombarding the east side frequently with small steel cannons, attempting to prevent the Chinese army from crossing the river. On the 16th, from morning to night, they bombarded the Chinese army across the river at Makou. From the 18th to the 21st, they bombarded the Chinese army positions in Jinli all day long. The Chinese troops in both places calmly responded and repeatedly fired back. At the same time, Japanese aircraft also flew upstream along the West River for days, carrying out large-scale bombing. It is reported that Yongan, Guangli, Jinli, Beishui, Lubu, Xinqiao, Shoulong, Baituo in Gaoyao County, Xinlong Village outside Sihui County, and Canggang, Baisha, Dasha, Shangluo, Sibao, Xiangshawei, the lower and middle districts of Gaoming, and the communication lines between Guangning and various places have all been tragically bombed. The Japanese army's actions are aimed at harassing the rear of the Chinese army, but also at attempting to disrupt the Chinese military transport. However, the entire plan of the Chinese army to counterattack Guangzhou has already been decided by the military authorities. In addition to going east along the West River, the main force will advance along the Yuehan Railway from the North River. Therefore, the Japanese troops on the north bank of the West River still have concerns, fearing that they will be attacked from all sides by the Chinese army. Therefore, the Japanese troops invading Lubao already showed signs of fleeing towards Mumian Gang on the 24th. With the Japanese army at a loss of whether to advance or retreat, the war on the north bank has also become slightly calmer. In order to achieve the goals of capturing Sanzhou and Jinli and invading Gaoyao, the Japanese army on the south bank first attempted to attack the guerrillas near Jiujiang to stabilize Jiujiang. On the other hand, they attacked Gubusha Ping in Heshan County, in order to cover their advance. Therefore, the Chinese guerrillas in the southeast of Jiujiang Shakou and in the Ganzhutan area have been fighting fiercely with the Japanese army from time to time. On the 21st and 22nd, the Japanese army in Jiujiang fired over sixty shells, fiercely bombarding Gubusha Ping, covering the landing of Japanese troops in rubber boats. However, the local self-defense forces and guerrillas rose up to resist, destroying two rubber boats and killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army retreated in disarray. Therefore, the port of Heshan is currently tense again.

The Japanese troops invading the West River originally had very few troops. During this period, the Japanese army transferred a large number of troops from the East River to Guangzhou and then reinforced Jiujiang. The Chinese army on the East River took the opportunity to recover Huizhou and Boluo. On the 23rd, the Chinese army continued to send reinforcements to the front line. Their vanguard troops had reached the vicinity of Jiuzitan at the junction of Zeng and Boluo counties. After establishing contact with the troops in Zeng, they would join the counterattack. The large army reinforcing Dongguan has also decided to cross Heyuan, Huizhou, and Boluo to reach Dongguan County, and is currently advancing in two routes: one follows the Danshui River in Huizhou, reaching Longgang at 3 pm on the 23rd, and arriving at Pinghu on the 24th. The mission of this route is to contact Zhang Ruigui's troops guarding Baoan County and Tan Sui's troops holding the line along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and jointly attack Dongguan County; the other follows the East River upstream, directly attacking Shilong, and taking the opportunity to sweep away the remaining Japanese troops in Taiping and Humen. From this, it is inevitable that a major war will break out on the entire Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line within days.

On the southern front, since over a hundred Japanese warships gathered and patrolled in the Beihai, Weizhou Island, and Hainan Island areas, intending to harass the coast, the situation in various areas of the southern front was extremely tense. By the 24th, the Japanese warships in Dasha, Bailongwei, Shigui Tou, and Guantouling in Beihai had all sailed away, and the situation had eased again. However, the military authorities have dispatched additional troops to strictly guard against emergencies. Currently, Yangjiang and Dianbai are guarded by troops led by × Brigade and × Regiment and × Guerrilla Headquarters Chen Xiujue. The ×× Guerrilla Commander also leads the local forces of Gaozhou and the newly formed × Division and ×× Regiment, guarding the coastal line of Gaozhou. In Beihai, in addition to the troops of the Guajun Mo Shujie and Huang Gu divisions, several divisions of infantry have been continuously arriving from Guangxi Province and stationed there. Currently, the deployment on the southern front is in place, and the strength of the resistance is very strong.

### Chinese Troops Recapture Yixing, Once Reaching Caoqiao, the Japanese Army's Headquarters

A telegram from Yixing: According to reliable reports, the Chinese army stationed in the Zhangzhu Mountains of Yixing launched a general attack on the Japanese troops stationed in Yixing City in late December. The two hundred or so Japanese troops in the city, although armed with small steel cannons and light and heavy machine guns, hastily resisted. However, the Chinese army was large and strong, and fiercely attacked the city. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than half of the Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and the remaining troops fled in disarray to the surrounding villages. The Chinese army recaptured Yicheng on the 24th. A portion of the Japanese troops, numbering several dozen, fled along the highway to Caoqiao Town, where the Japanese army headquarters was located. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to advance and pursued Caoqiao. It is rumored that they even occupied Caoqiao, but this has not been confirmed. Currently, the Chinese army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in Heqiao, more than ten miles away from Yicheng. It is reported that Heqiao is an important town in Yixing, with prosperous commerce and a hub for water and land transportation. It is also learned that after the Chinese army entered Yicheng, they searched for the puppet "County Magistrate" Zang Lichen, but Zang and others had fled beforehand. They destroyed the puppet "County Government" and arrested Xu Kaishan, the "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Yicheng. They originally intended to execute him by shooting, but after the elders of Yicheng pleaded for his life, he was spared death and is now imprisoned.

### On Eyeglasses

— Feng Liutang

1. The Use of Eyes is Great Indeed

The world refers to a person's wisdom as intelligence; "Cong" (聰, listening) refers to the carefulness of hearing; "Ming" (明, seeing) refers to the clarity of sight. The achievement of knowledge and experience, the ability to delve deeply, all come from seeing and hearing, so using "Congming" (聰明, intelligent) to describe a person's wisdom also emphasizes the importance of the ear and eye organs. Since ancient times, the merits and demerits of all things have been perceived by the eyes, and then contemplation and action arise. Without seeing, one loses clarity; losing clarity means not knowing what is superior and what is inferior. The inability to distinguish between superior and inferior leads to a lack of understanding of right and wrong; a lack of understanding of right and wrong leads to a lack of impartiality in justice. Whether it be a large matter concerning society and the nation, or a small matter concerning companies and families, if what is seen is unclear, there will inevitably be a rise in the way of petty people and a decline in the way of gentlemen, leading to the steps of chaos, destruction, and failure. Only with clarity can one distinguish between the virtuous and the treacherous, know good and evil, understand right and wrong, uphold justice, discern obedience and defiance, and strictly follow or reject. Even with enemy countries and foreign troubles, one's spirit will not be taken away; even with poverty and hardship, one's will will not be shaken. Then the country will inevitably be harmonious, and the people will inevitably prosper. This is what Gao Yao meant by "Heaven's intelligence comes from the intelligence of our people," which is precisely to gather the wisdom of the masses and make it the wisdom of society and the nation.

Not only that, but a person's goodness, evil, wisdom, and foolishness can always be seen in their eyes. We do not need physiognomy; we can use Mencius' words to prove it:

"Of all things that exist in a person, nothing is better than the pupils. The pupils cannot hide their evil. If the chest is upright, the pupils are clear; if the chest is not upright, the pupils are dim. Listen to their words, observe their pupils, and how can a person conceal themselves!"

Listening to their words is "Cong" (聰, listening), observing their pupils is "Ming" (明, seeing). A person who cannot clearly discern right and wrong and does not know good from bad is one without eyes. But those who "have sight enough to see the tip of an autumn hair, but cannot see a cartload of firewood," or those who view things through a pipe or measure with a gourd, how can they be called people with eyes!

Due to physiological reasons, people cannot guarantee the uniformity of their eyesight. Those with normal vision can change to farsightedness, becoming unclear about nearby objects; those with nearsightedness cannot distinguish objects beyond a foot away. To compensate for these defects, eyeglasses are used. Eyeglasses allow those with unclear vision to see clearly and enable eyesight to reach where it cannot reach. With eyeglasses, the near can see far, the far can see near, and everything becomes convenient. Moreover, as culture becomes more developed, there are more opportunities to use the eyes, the consumption of eyesight becomes greater, and the need for eyeglasses becomes more widespread. This is a natural trend.

However, those who wear eyeglasses do so originally to seek clarity, but those who wear colored eyeglasses should be careful. Colored eyeglasses are for reducing the irritation of light rays. If one mistakenly believes that the color of the lens is the color of the object, and that what one sees is what others see, then it will be like what Mozi said, "Dyed in blue, it becomes blue; dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow; there is nowhere it does not lose its true nature."

At the beginning of the New Year, there are usually words of celebration and works of interest, but it is difficult to choose such texts within the pages of an economic journal. Desiring to avoid straying from the nature of economics and to see the development of Sino-Western trade, I thought of the ancient saying about health, which often speaks of "acute hearing and clear eyesight, nimble hands and feet." It is also said that those who build great careers must have "broad vision and keen insights." Therefore, I wrote "On Eyeglasses" to wish you all brighter eyes and broader vision, not to be confined to current facts, nor to haggle over one's own interests. Stand firm, broaden your vision, and next year on this day, I will celebrate the victorious New Year with you all. And to show that eyeglasses, though small, are the beginning of Sino-Western trade, this is the study.

2. Where Do Eyeglasses Ultimately Come From?

Did eyeglasses originate in China, or were they imported from foreign countries? A little common-sense research will reveal that they are a product of science and certainly did not originate in China. But then, where did they come from, and when did they first enter China? Due to a lack of records, it is difficult to have accurate verification. The origins of eyeglasses recorded in various books are mostly based on Zhang Jing's "Miscellaneous Records of Fangzhou" from the Ming Dynasty, which states that they came from the Malacca on foreign ships. His father, Lord Fangbo, once received them as a gift from Emperor Xuanmiao, referring to Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, eyeglasses already existed during the Xuande reign (1426-1435). But what kind of country was Malacca to have these eyeglasses? This requires first understanding the state of overseas transportation at that time.

According to records, Emperor Chengzu (Yongle Emperor) seized the throne, and Emperor Huiwen fled, whereabouts unknown. Emperor Chengzu suspected that he was still alive and searched for him throughout the country without success, so he wanted to seek him abroad. (1) In June of the third year of Yongle (1405), he ordered the Three Treasures Eunuch Zheng He to lead Wang Jinghong and others to communicate with the Western Oceans. They sailed from Liujia River in Suzhou (now Liuhe), from Liuhe to Ningbo, then transferred to Fujian, and from Fujian went to the South Seas. This journey lasted until September of the fifth year, when they returned to the country. (2) In September of the sixth year, they went to Ceylon and other countries again, and returned to the country in June of the ninth year. (3) In November of the tenth year, he again ordered He to go to Sumatra and other places, and returned to court in July of the thirteenth year. (4) In the fourteenth year, nineteen countries including Malacca and Calicut all sent envoys to pay tribute. Later, he ordered He and others to accompany them to bestow gifts upon their rulers, and they returned in July of the seventeenth year. (5) In the spring of the nineteenth year, they went again, and returned in August of the following year. (6) In January of the twenty-second year, Shi Jisun, the chief of Old Harbor, requested to inherit the position of commissioner, and he was ordered to bring the imperial edict and seal to bestow upon him. By the time he returned, Emperor Chengzu had already passed away. (7) In June of the fifth year of Xuande, the Emperor, seeing that many foreign countries were still far from paying tribute after a long reign, Zheng He and Wang Jinghong were again ordered to visit seventeen countries including Hormuz and return. He went abroad a total of seven times, traveling from the islands of the South Seas to India (Bengal and Ceylon) and more than thirty other countries. The number of unnamed treasures he obtained was countless. "Unnamed" meant that many of them were never seen by the Chinese, so they could not be named. If eyeglasses are also included in these "unnamed treasures," then the Xuande reign should have had this item. Conversely, if it must be said that they came from Malacca, then Malacca in the early Ming Dynasty was still subject to Siam, merely a newly developed tribe. In the first year of Yongle, the Ming eunuch Yin Qing sent envoys to its territory, using gold and silk to entice its chieftain to come to court. In September of the third year, the chieftain followed Qing to Beijing, and Emperor Chengzu enfeoffed him as the King of Malacca. The title of King of Malacca began from this point. Zheng He sent envoys to their country in the sixth year, and tribute was regularly paid from then until the seventeenth year of Chenghua, a total of twenty-three times.

Although tribute was paid frequently, one does not see any glass-like products among its goods. Even judging by their intelligence, it seems unlikely that they could produce eyeglasses. Therefore, in terms of products, it can be compared with the products of Sumatra, which is separated by a narrow strip of water, to see that although there may be handicrafts among Malacca's products, it is doubtful that they were self-produced. The "Blue History" states that Sumatra's climate, customs, and human nature are exactly the same, so its products should be no different.

(1) Malacca's Products:

Agate, pearls, coral trees, helmeted hornbill, golden helmeted hornbill, rhinoceros horn, ivory, black bear, black ape, white muntjac, turkey, parrot, sarong, white cotton cloth, Western cloth, Sahara cloth, borneol camphor, rose water, storax oil, gardenia, Oudh, agarwood, benzoin, gold and silver incense, asafoetida, tin.

(2) Sumatra's Products:

Agate, precious stones, crystal, azurite, Huihui blue, fine horses, rhinoceros, agarwood, benzoin, cloves, ambergris, frankincense, true incense, knife noodles, tin, sarong, pepper, sappanwood, sulfur.

Then how could Malacca have products that Sumatra does not? This can prove that some of Malacca's products were European products. That is why the Ming people said that eyeglasses came from Malacca on foreign ships.

During the Zhengde period of the Ming Dynasty (1511 AD, the sixth year of Zhengde), the Frankish (Portuguese) forcibly invaded and seized their territory. King Su Duan Ma Mo fled and sent envoys to report the difficulty. Emperor Shizong succeeded to the throne and ordered the Frankish to return their former territory, citing the righteousness of helping neighbors in distress. However, there was no response, and Malacca was eventually destroyed. Previously, due to inconvenient transportation, the Ming Dynasty still did not know that the Frankish had destroyed Malacca, so in the thirteenth year of Zhengde (1516 AD), envoys led by Captain Mo and others were sent to offer local products and request enfeoffment. Only then did they learn the name. (According to Portuguese writer Tomé Pires, they arrived in Guangzhou from Malacca in 1516 AD). An edict was issued to give them the value of their local products and send them back. These people stayed for a long time and robbed travelers, even abducting children to eat. Later, they colluded with the eunuch guarding the town to enter Beijing, while Emperor Wuzong made a southern tour (August of the fourteenth year of Zhengde). Their envoy, the eunuch Ya San, served Emperor Jiang Bin, and the Emperor learned their language as a joke. It was not until the fifteenth year that they were allowed to pay tribute. In the sixteenth year, Emperor Wuzong died, and in July of that year, they brought local products to seek trade, but were refused. Their general, Bidulu, with his powerful cannons and sharp weapons, plundered Malacca and other countries, rampaging on the sea. He also led his subordinates to attack the Balaxi country with five ships. In the second year of Jiajing (1523 AD), they invaded Xicao Bay in Xinhui. The Ming commander Ke Rong and others resisted them, captured Bidulu and others alive, and obtained their cannons, which were named "Frankish cannons," and cut off their trade. However, at that time, the officials of Guangdong all collected fees from foreign ships for public and private expenses. If foreign ships did not arrive, they would have nothing to gain, so they requested the court to allow them to trade again. Thus, the Frankish were able to enter Xiangshan'ao (Macau) to trade. By the fourteenth year of Jiajing, the Portuguese had built houses and cities in Xiangshan'ao, dominating the seaside like a country. The tall buildings and flying eaves stood in rows, and merchants from Fujian and Guangdong flocked to them. Over time, more and more of them came, and people from other countries feared and avoided them, so they were occupied exclusively by them. In the forty-fourth year of Jiajing, they still claimed to be paying tribute from Malacca. The court officials knew that it was a false pretense by the Frankish and refused them. But later, people from the Atlantic Ocean (Italians) and others came to China and also lived there.

The customs of Malacca were originally simple and honest, and trade was fair. But since it was broken by the Frankish, its customs have changed greatly, and merchant ships rarely arrive, mostly going directly to Sumatra. However, they must pass through its country, and are often robbed, almost cutting off the sea route. Those who sell directly to China arrive directly at Xiangshan'ao in Guangdong, and the arrivals are endless.

From this historical fact, Malacca was already occupied by the Frankish during the Zhengde period, and until the forty-fourth year of Jiajing, the Frankish still claimed to be from Malacca when traveling to and from China. This is because the Chinese only knew of Malacca, so the Frankish claimed to be Malacca. They did not know that the so-called Frankish were far in the western corner of Europe, while Malacca was near the southern end of Siam. Historians still said that the Frankish and Malacca were close to each other, how could others distinguish the distance of their lands? The confusion between the Frankish and Malacca is the origin of the misconception that eyeglasses came from Malacca.

Moreover, the Ming people also obtained eyeglasses from the Western Regions. Wu Kuan's "Pao Weng Collection" has a poem thanking someone for sending him eyeglasses from the Western Regions:

"The world says that Li Lou had keen eyes,
His eyes could not be obscured.
After a thousand years of decay,
They transform and are worth a hundred yi."

Wu Kuan was the champion of the Ming Dynasty's Chenghua eight-year imperial examination. He was from Changzhou (even today, people still enjoy talking about the Four Talents of Wu: Tang, Zhu, Wen, and Xu, all of whom were Wu's later generations). He served through the Chenghua, Hongzhi, and Zhengde reigns, and died in office. He was known for his high moral character, and his poems and essays were considered classic for his time. He praised the eyeglasses from the Western Regions so highly, comparing them to the sight of Li Lou (a famous ancient person with keen eyesight), saying that they transformed after a thousand years and were worth a hundred yi (each yi is twenty-four taels, this phrase emphasizes how valuable it was). How much he cherished them! Therefore, the description of eyeglasses in the "General Draft of Seven Revisions" seems like mythology today. It says:

"I heard that noblemen have eyeglasses. When old men read books, they can see even the smallest characters. They are truly worldly treasures. These are made with living giant clam shells as the lens. They must always be kept warm in the bosom, lest they dry out and die, and then they can illuminate the characters."

Why are there such bizarre and absurd stories, and why are they so valuable? According to the "General Encyclopedia," eyeglasses from the Western Regions became popular in China during the middle of the Ming Dynasty. Merchants exaggerated their claims, so people at that time were fooled like this. According to records, land transportation between Europe and Asia began in the Han Dynasty, and became even more frequent during the Yuan Dynasty, reaching deep into Central Europe. By the Ming Dynasty, although various countries west of the city were as far as Arabia, many entered Jiayu Pass by land. In the fifth year of Yide, Zheng He sent envoys to the Western Oceans, sending envoys to Calicut. Calicut had ships to Arabia, so he sent people to attach to their boats to go there. Arabia also sent envoys to pay tribute, and Emperor Yizong was greatly pleased. After that, countries from Arabia often traveled by sea via Java and Malacca, while those traveling by land still entered Jiayu Pass from the western city.

From this perspective, eyeglasses flowed into China as early as the Yide period, and as late as the Hongzhi and Zhengde periods. One route of import was from Malacca on foreign ships, and the other was from the Western Regions. In short, they both flowed in indirectly from the West.

3. The Naming and Form of Eyeglasses

Eyeglasses were originally called "Aihdai" (僾逮), also written as (　　). "Aihdai" (僾逮) originally meant the appearance of clouds, which is unrelated to eyeglasses. It is suspected that word-makers thought the two characters "Aihdai" (璦逮) were not elegant enough, so they changed them. But why are eyeglasses called "Aihdai" (僾逮)? This has not been explained by previous people. Some think it means "as if." But using "as if" to describe eyeglasses is also difficult to interpret. I suspect that it is a transliteration that also captures the idea of resembling the eyes, hence the name "Aihdai" (僾逮). If it is a transliteration, it should have been transliterated from Portuguese, Malay, or Arabic. I am not familiar with these three languages. However, many of the tribute items recorded in the "History of the Ming Dynasty" already used transliterations, such as "Saha La," "Duo Luo Lian," "Wu Die Ni," and "Bai Bi Bu," which are evidence of this. However, in English (although English was not popular in the East at that time), the terms for eyeglasses, such as "Spectacle" and "Eye-glass," have no scent of "Aihdai" (僾逮) to be found. Only "Eyed" is somewhat similar, but it is an adjective, and its meaning is not very appropriate. Later people also thought that it was the local language of the Fujian and Guangdong people at that time, which was passed down and written in this book. In short, the two characters "Aihdai" (僾逮), when used for eyeglasses, cannot clearly show the use of the object, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, in Wu Kuan's poems from the Zhengde era, the term "eyeglasses" (眼鏡) was already used. Because the meaning of "Jing" (鏡, mirror) has the meaning of illuminating and viewing, using it for the eyes, hence the name "Yanjing" (眼鏡, eyeglasses), fully shows the function and form, which is much better than the ambiguous and unclear "Aihdai" (僾逮), so it has been used until now.

The Ming people described the shape of eyeglasses in Zhang Jing's "Miscellaneous Records of Fangzhou":

"Like two large coins, their shape and color are very similar to mica, but their texture is very thin. They are outlined and buttoned with gold, so that when closed, they become one, and when opened, they become two. When the eyes of old people are dim, placing this object on both eyes makes them very clear. They come from the country of Malacca on foreign ships, and are called 'Aihdai' (靉靆). They are all made of glass, and later, the people of Guangdong imitated their style and made them with crystal stones."

Therefore, in the "Poetry Collection of Ou Bei," the first poem using eyeglasses says:

"It is said that during the Xuande reign,
They came from foreign ships.
Originally inlaid with glass,
Thin as freshly polished paper.
The Central Kingdom imitated and made them,
Crystal also became a cheap imitation."

The change from glass to crystal for eyeglasses was precisely because China had no glass production. There is also a popular seven-character poem about eyeglasses (pagoda style), which is also laughable.

Previous people have also written several couplets about eyeglasses, with roughly the same ideas, such as:

"A long string is tied to both ears,
A horizontal bridge straddles the nose."

Or:

From Daoyi's poems, it can be seen that the eyeglasses of the previous generations mostly used strings as earpieces, worn on both ears.

4. Reading Glasses and Nearsighted Glasses

In the ninth year of Wanli (1581 AD), the Italian Matteo Ricci arrived at Xiangshan'ao in Guangzhou. In the twenty-ninth year, he entered Beijing, sending Wang Fengyang, Su Mano, and others to Nanjing. Those who came with them also included the Italian Long Huamin, Bi Fangji, Ai Rueluo, and Xiong Sanba, the German Deng Yuhan, the Spaniard Pang Diwo, and the Portuguese Yang Manuo, all of whom were engaged in spreading the Catholic faith. Scholars such as Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao were fond of their teachings, so Western culture and products flowed into the mainland with the missionaries. Eyeglasses were also among them.

However, eyeglasses were still rare at that time, and it was still the case in the early Qing Dynasty. Therefore, when Jiang Tingxi saw that Emperor Kangxi had eyeglasses in the inner court, he begged for one for his mother. Also, in the book "Dream of the Red Chamber," which was written about the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods, even in a family like the Jia family, only the Jia mother had eyeglasses, and they were only mentioned three times in the whole book. As in volume 53, it says:

"There was also a mirror box. The Jia mother leaned on the pillow, chatting and laughing with everyone, and then took out her eyeglasses to look at the stage. She also said, 'Forgive me for being old and my bones hurting. Allow me to be presumptuous and accompany you leaning down!'"

And in volume 69, it says:

"Second Sister (You Erjie) stood beside her with her head down. The Jia mother looked her up and down, and then smiled and asked, 'What is your name? How old are you this year?' Feng Jie quickly smiled and said, 'Old ancestor, don't ask yet, just say whether she is prettier than me or not.' The Jia mother put on her eyeglasses again and ordered Mandarin Duck and Amber to pull the child over for me to see her skin.' Everyone smiled with their mouths pursed and pushed her forward. The Jia mother looked carefully and ordered Amber to take out her hand for me to see. The Jia mother looked up and down, took off her eyeglasses, smiled and said, 'She is indeed a complete child. I think she is even prettier than you (referring to Feng Jie).'"

The third time eyeglasses are mentioned is in volume 95, which says:

"When the Jia mother opened it, she saw that the jade was much dimmer than before. She rubbed it with her hand, and Mandarin Duck put on her eyeglasses and took a look, saying, 'Strange, the piece of jade is indeed the same, but why has the color disappeared inside!'"

It should be known that Shezheng, Lady Wang, and others are all in their fifties. They should be wearing eyeglasses. Although it is said that when parents are alive, one does not speak of being old, and one does not wear eyeglasses in front of elders, but even when in casual settings, there is no mention of wearing eyeglasses. Also, like Granny Liu, who is over seventy years old, there is no mention of eyeglasses, precisely because eyeglasses were still rare at that time, and only high-ranking officials and noble families had them. They were not commonly seen among the people.

Moreover, the difficulty in obtaining eyeglasses is further proven by the following facts: (1) Chinese books, due to the use of woodblock printing, could not have very fine characters, which was also for the convenience of elderly people to read, so the font was usually large. (2) If a family had eyeglasses, they were very precious, and often passed down from parents to children. The earpieces would be broken, and they would be tied with cloth strings and worn on both ears. If they were easily obtained, why would there be such a situation? Therefore, at that time, elderly people rarely wore eyeglasses. If there were eyeglasses available to wear but not worn, it was considered amazing.

It is said that when the scholar Weng Fanggang (Tanxi) was in his sixties or seventies, he could still write fine characters under the lamp without using "Aihdai" (eyeglasses). Every year on New Year's Day, he wrote four regular script characters on watermelon seeds. After fifty, he wrote "Wan Shou Wu Jiang" (Long Live); after sixty, he wrote "Tian Zi Wan Nian" (Emperor Live Ten Thousand Years); after seventy, he could still write "Tian Xia Tai Ping" (Peace Under Heaven). Although his writing gradually decreased, being able to write these characters on a watermelon seed at an old age is something that no one can achieve. (If Weng Tanxi were alive today, he would definitely write "Zhonghua Wansui" (Long Live China) yesterday on New Year's Day). It is also said that Weng was able to write the seven characters "A Piece of Ice Heart in a Jade Pot" on a sesame seed in his early years. The superiority of his eyesight was truly an unusual gift, and his skill was also miraculous.

What is mentioned above mostly refers to reading glasses. Nearsighted glasses have not been seen. Because there were no eyeglasses for nearsightedness, those who suffered from nearsightedness had to squint their eyes and get close to things to see them, which was often called "squinting eyes." Previous people had a poem mocking nearsighted eyes:

"Laughing at your eyes, so strange,
Standing next to you, I ask who you are.
In the sunlight, I grab at eggs,
As the moon moves, I gather firewood.
From looking at wall paintings, I wear through my nose,
From locking the bookcase, I pinched my eyebrows.
Even more ridiculous is this:
Blowing out the lamp, I burned my lips."

It can be seen that if those suffering from nearsightedness had eyeglasses, they would not suffer this loss. I recall that the prevalence of nearsighted glasses was still between the Guangxu and Xuantong periods. At that time, those who suffered from nearsightedness began to use eyeglasses. There were no nearsighted glasses during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. How can this be proven? It can be proven by Qianlong.

It is said that Qianlong also suffered from nearsightedness. When he made a southern tour to Suzhou and arrived at Hushu Pass, he did not see the three dots of water next to it and mistakenly called it "Xu 　Pass." People thought it came from the emperor, so they followed suit. (Later, Liang Zhangju defended Qianlong, saying that it could be read as "Xu," but dictionaries all read it as "Hu.") Therefore, if there were nearsighted glasses at that time, Qianlong would definitely not have failed to see the water.

There is another proof of Qianlong's nearsightedness. The reason for nearsightedness is that the eyeball protrudes, and the line of sight falls in front of the focal point. Therefore, as one gets older, the eyeball naturally contracts and gradually flattens, the line of sight approaches the focal point, and one can see objects without eyeglasses. Therefore, Qianlong's not using eyeglasses in his later years is proof of his nearsightedness. It is said that after Ruan Yuan (Yuntai) entered the History Office, He Shen happened to be in charge of the academy, and Yuan treated him with great respect as a disciple. Shortly thereafter, there was a major examination of the Hanlin Academy, and Emperor Gaozong (Qianlong) used eyeglasses as the topic. He Shen knew that Qianlong did not use eyeglasses in his old age, so he leaked the information to Yuan in advance. Therefore, Yuan's poem says:

"Why does the four-eyed need this?
The double-pupiled does not need another."

Emperor Gaozong used "another" as the rhyme, and praised the poem, placing it in the first rank. When Ji Xiaolan (Yun) was summoned to see him, Qianlong also ordered him to write a poem about eyeglasses, using "another" as the rhyme. Ji immediately recited a couplet:

"How can the wise and bright one need this?
Your humble servant must have another."

They both used the fact that Qianlong did not wear eyeglasses in his old age in their poems, which clearly shows that he suffered from nearsightedness.

As for the officials who suffered from nearsightedness, there were many. During the Yongzheng period, a certain lord was very nearsighted. One day when he entered the court, Yongzheng asked him, "Can you see me?" He replied, "The Emperor's majesty does not violate the face within a foot." His response can be said to be quick.

Sun Erzhun (Pingshu), the Duke of Jin Gui and Wen Qing, was originally nearsighted. One year, he traveled to the Qiantang River and encountered the autumn tide. He was very happy and wanted to watch the tide, so he set out a boat in the middle of the river to wait. When the tide arrived, he heard the sound of ten thousand horses galloping and rushed to the bow of the boat. The boatman advised him against it, but he did not listen. Before he could stand still, he was swept into the river by the tide. In a hurry, he only felt the waves pressing over his shoulders and back, with the weight of ten million pounds, tossing and turning three or four times, and then he was thrown onto the riverbank, unharmed. Sun himself said that he had always been nearsighted, and although he was greatly frightened, he did not recognize the shape of the tide.

My study on eyeglasses ends here. The recent prevalence of eyeglasses, the improvement of styles, and the types of lenses are not included in this study, so they are omitted. Some of my friends who see this article will definitely smile and say, "Liu is using his energy on such things, making a mountain out of a molehill, which is very meaningless." But those who say this have never known my intention. Is it really that I like to do this? There is nothing to do to pass the time, so I am just writing this as a conversation starter for the New Year for you all.

### The New Year of Language and Writing

— Zheng Rong

Our Chinese language and writing, with its long history and deep, broad cultural background in both modern vernacular and classical forms, is indeed one of our most valuable cultural assets. However, there are four difficulties that often plague people: first, it is difficult to look up words; second, it is difficult to learn; third, it is difficult to read; and fourth, it is difficult to write. For many years, countless knowledgeable and ambitious people have tried to overcome these four major difficulties, but they have not yet fully succeeded.

To address the difficulty of looking up words, there have been various indexing schemes. I don't know how many types of indexing schemes there are, but the most popular one now is Mr. Wang Yunwu's Four-Corner Method. In addition to being used universally for books published by the Commercial Press, it has also been adopted elsewhere. However, other schemes are still being promoted simultaneously, so it cannot be considered the only one.

Second, to address the difficulty of learning, there have been various schemes for basic characters. We have also seen many basic character schemes, with the "Thousand Character Classic" being popular in the past and the "Common People's Thousand Character Course" being popular recently. In addition to the "Thousand Character Course," there is also Mr. Hong Shen's "Twelve Hundred Characters." Currently, these are all being promoted separately.

Third, to address the difficulty of reading, there have been schemes for unifying pronunciation or phonetic notation. We have also seen countless schemes, some original and some adopted from existing systems. Among the original ones, there are many types, including radical-based systems, shorthand systems, seal script systems, cursive script systems, and others, all of which have now disappeared. The most popular are three types that adopt existing scripts: one adopts existing ancient Chinese characters, called Zhuyin Fuhao (Phonetic Symbols); and two adopt existing international alphabets, one called Gwoyeu Romatzyh (National Romanization), and one called Latinxua Sin Wenz (Latinized Chinese Characters). Among these, the one that adopts ancient Chinese characters is only used to annotate the pronunciation of ordinary Chinese characters, so it is called Zhuyin Fuhao. The two that adopt international alphabets are not only used for phonetic notation, but also attempt to function as self-sufficient writing systems, thus attempting to solve the three difficulties beyond just reading. Currently, all three are being promoted separately.

Fourth, to address the difficulty of writing, there have been explorations of grammar, rhetoric, and various other rules, as well as experiments with various language teaching methods, in an attempt to break away from the old habit that Mr. Ma Jianzhong described as "because there are aspects of literature that cannot be taught, even those that can be taught are not discussed."

The efforts in all four areas are aimed at preventing everyone from spending too much time and effort on language and writing, and at preventing language and writing themselves from remaining forever in the mysterious realm of "can be understood but not expressed," untouched by scientific illumination. Although there is a lot of work, it can actually be summarized as "progress through simplification." Although opinions on various schemes are not entirely consistent among all those who are dedicated to this cause, there is no disagreement on the need for this simplified progress in language and writing reform. What is lacking is coordination and communication. If we can go a step further and bring our opinions closer together or coordinate our work, the efforts in language and writing reform will surely be more effective. Perhaps in as little as three years, we can create a new year for language and writing that eliminates all four difficulties, and the popularization of education and the advancement of culture will surely be several times easier than they are now. I sincerely hope that everyone will keep this matter in mind and make it one of their New Year's resolutions.

### New Year's in Phoenix Town

— Zhang Zhenshan

As the night gradually fell, the sky filled with the sound of firecrackers, and every thatched cottage and hut radiated the glow of candles. The aroma of New Year's Eve dinner wafted in the biting cold wind. The entire Phoenix Town seemed to shed its decline and poverty in the joyful atmosphere of New Year's Eve.

Stationed in an ancient temple, we looked at the New Year's scene in the town and couldn't help but seek out the forgotten joys of the New Year. One of our comrades, speaking in his Nanjing Mandarin, said, "It's still one hundred and eighty li to Qianqian. We won't be able to chop those xx until next year anyway, so let's have a happy New Year's Eve here!"

Just as he finished speaking, a messenger suddenly ran in to report, "We're setting off early tomorrow morning. The battalion commander has given special permission to celebrate the New Year here. The pork that was supposed to be eaten on New Year's Day tomorrow will be distributed tonight."

"Great! New Year's, New Year's!" A group of comrades immediately cheered excitedly upon hearing this news, their eyes sparkling with joy. They set up iron stoves in the courtyard and began cooking rice and roasting meat. The unusual cold was dispelled by the flames and the aroma of meat, and everyone was intoxicated by the enjoyment of abundant material goods.

However, celebrating the New Year in the military is not as leisurely and carefree as it is for the common people. Just as we were about to eat the meat, a sentry came to report that someone was sneaking across the Phoenix River. Then, a series of challenge passwords were heard from outside, each one more urgent than the last. We immediately ran out of the ancient temple, divided into two groups, and surrounded the riverbank, trapping four spies who had crossed the警戒line. At this moment, a fire suddenly broke out behind the ancient temple, and several gunshots were heard from the village to the east. The situation was indeed extremely serious. We immediately split into four groups and, using rapid marching, patrolled and searched the surroundings. In an instant, sixteen arsonist traitors and four enemy soldiers in plainclothes were subdued with our hemp ropes and escorted to the battalion headquarters like cowherds leading cattle.

On the way, the four enemy soldiers in plainclothes pleaded with us in broken Chinese, and then spoke among themselves in some foreign language "...is...亨得拿打...." At the same time, they took out a roll of banknotes from their pockets, meaning to bribe us to let them go. What a despicable act! An insult to the personality of the soldiers of our new China. We kicked them, "Budu" a sound, stopping their talk, causing them to retract their hands that held the banknotes, and a row of prisoners and traitors were escorted to the regiment headquarters in silent walking.

The battalion commander, who was reviewing the map under the dim light of a bean oil lamp, listened to our report and seemed to look pleased. Smiling, he ordered them to be released, and then addressed us: "I used this time to test the defensive capabilities and quick wits of you new recruits, and also to examine your adherence to duty. Now I sent twenty people out, not a single one had been missed, and money was not accepted as bribes. Although you are new recruits, I am very satisfied..." After the battalion commander concluded his remarks, his gaze was bright, as if entrusting an expectation to us.

We saw that the twenty disguised brothers had all changed back into their original military uniforms and felt a bit empty with the joy in our hearts; dejectedly walked out of the headquarters, our hearts filled with the yearning to catch real enemies in the future.

After returning to the team, they also received a special reward of twenty pounds of meat from the battalion commander—a towel. While gobbling up the food, New Year's Eve quietly passed away, and the god of time brought New Year's Day to the world. Although the biting north wind was howling in the sky, the dynamics of the villages and towns revealed the atmosphere of the New Spring after all.

### The Arrival of the New

— Liu Shou

With just a few hours separating us, everything from the past was buried, expelled! Only "New" fills this world, bringing fresh light!

Everyone is waiting, praying: for the arrival of this "New." "New" presides over this world, presides over all people!

In the human world, on the earth, everywhere there are lively and beautiful embryos, growing in the "New," forgetting the sins of the past, the shames of the past, the worries of the past, the past of…

"New" bestows upon us infinite pleasure, extreme joy, inspiring us to advance, to glorify; like a gentle breeze, awakening the flowers, glistening dew drops, nourishing the grass and trees, everything is awakening in the arrival of the "New," growing vigorously,

In the universe, perhaps darkness has already dissipated! All that can be seen is light, all that can exist is light!

This is where heroes put their skills to use, when great people go to war, like a lone boat on the sea, seeing the light of a lighthouse from afar, like a traveler climbing a mountain, reaching the top.

It is the "New" that will make us triumphant, that will sing songs of praise for us, words of blessing. "New" indicates our fulfilling fate, everyone loves the "New," cherishes the "New"!

This is the time of the arrival of the new, but we do not know when it will leave. We can only start building our new careers now.

The new has come, has arrived! For the decadent, it has injected clean blood; for the passive, it has provided the right medicine. Only the "New" can drive away the large group of ghosts and kill billions of germs.

The new has arrived, let the people embark on their journeys!

### Boat

— Yang Yanqi

Because I live on an "island," I think of boats.

Among all means of transportation, the boat is what I like best; because the boat sails on the sea, I love the vast and boundless sea; and appreciating the sea view is impossible without sitting on a boat, so I love boats, for no other reason.

In summer, the summer in my imagination, sitting on the deck looking at the sunset reflected on the sea surface, how wonderful! But now it is winter. In winter, the cold wind, the heavy wind, the face-stinging wind, the angry wind, on the sea, blows up waves, lets the waves jump up, jump in the air, like a ping-pong ball falling on marble. This is also the sea scenery, the lively sea scenery, and only lying on a small boat can one appreciate the fun.

Boats, steamers, steamboats, sailboats, lifeboats are all things on the water. And the water, you can't catch it, you can't hold it tight, it floats, it flows, and it never stops. The earth is turning, the sun is shining, the moon reflects the light of the sun, the stars are twinkling, mankind is forever squirming on the ground, and the boat is forever swimming on the water, swimming, swimming, swimming, until the future.

Isn't life a boat? Crossing from this shore to the other shore is a lifetime. If the boat capsizes halfway, then it can only perish forever; if there is flesh and blood, there is life, then struggle, overcome the wind and waves, tighten the high sail, hold the rudder, and let peace and quiet squeeze out of the difficulties.

The sea is quiet, the water is smooth, waiting for the light on the other shore.

Heaven? Hell? Without a boat to ferry, how can you stand firm that day? Swaying east, swaying west, two eyes staring blankly at the lights on the other shore, waiting in vain, waiting in vain for a lifetime.

When the paddle is rowed, the boat will move, will float on the water, and will also proceed to the harbor in front.

The French poet Baudelaire (C. Baudelaire) said: "The harbor is a pleasant dwelling for someone tired of the hardships of life. The distant sky, the changing clouds, the uncertain sea colors, and the light of the lighthouse, form a beautiful view, enough to make the eyes enjoy it tirelessly. The long boat, with some tangled rigging that sways with the waves, is enough to keep the soul with the beautiful taste of loving rhythm. And for people without ambition and curiosity, there is a mystery, a noble pleasure. Sitting quietly in a building, or leaning on the railing on the shore, quietly watching the activities of those people: some are setting sail, some are sailing back, and some still have the desire to travel or want to make a fortune."

This "beautiful view," this "mysterious and noble pleasure," is on the sea, in the boat, in front of our eyes, and even more in our minds.

We also have the "desire power," not to travel, not to make a fortune, but to prop up a big ship, overcome the waves, flatten all the harmful magic waves, and destroy all the unrighteous demons; let a small boat quietly float on the Pacific Ocean, watching the sun sink in the beautiful scenery of the west.

### Entering the City (Part 1)

— Ding Ti

There were four of us in the group.

A long ridge of fields gradually disappeared behind us. Ahead was a continuous expanse of ochre fields, dry, boundless.

The clouds overhead were light and飘飘, very thin, thin enough to be somewhat transparent, azure, like lake water, like a sapphire.

We passed by the entrance of the "Epidemic Hospital," our hearts trembling, a knot of hatred entangled, like a snake, like a nail hammered into our chests.

That black, big house, it really is a man-eating devil! What a big thing! Its black and white walls, row by row, are gloomy; long and terrifying, it never ends.

We were so exhausted from yesterday that we had no strength at all, and we didn't speak to anyone. After a long silence, Lao Wang turned his head back, looked at that black thing, swallowed, and said with a lot of energy:

"Damn it! Epidemic hospital! Fooling ghosts! How many living people have been burned to death!"

Lao Lin, who was walking behind me, also chimed in:

"My neighbor was even more miserable! A rickshaw puller, suffering from malaria, was getting better. But, I don't know how, he was kicked by some damned military police, and they dragged him away. What a good thing! His life was over! Sent to this hospital, the doctor shook his head, shook his head, and sent him to the crematorium; without letting his wife say anything, a few torches, ready-made, a few puffs of smoke, a few balls of fire, and a living person died. Serves him right! Who told him to get sick! You go and reason with them!"

Neither Lao Zhang nor I answered. Our hearts were full of concern and restlessness.

We were tired and tortured enough by yesterday.

The beacon fire of the fighters was finally raised for us. We don't believe in our own strength, but justice encourages us, comforts us. We are walking on a difficult road, each holding a beacon in our hands, a beacon of light, and we finally see the light. The beacon fire! We still have it in our hands; if the right hand is cut off, there is still the left hand; if the left hand is cut off, we still have a heart, we still have an immortal soul.

That black and ugly hospital was thrown far, far away, and a large city lay across in front of us, our hearts coming alive.

Lao Wang reminded us!

"We're walking too fast! None of you are thinking, it's better to walk slowly! Look, where did that little cart go? I don't know where it went. Not too close, not too far."

Really, that little cart had fallen too far behind. It was a good thing Lao Wang thought of it, otherwise we would have honestly, swaggeringly entered the city, and if the cart couldn't find us after entering the city, that would have been really troublesome.

"Wait for that little cart!" We sat under a red-leaved tree, our eyes looking at the dense pine forest, a piece of sky, under the sky—a tree, a thatched shed, occasionally a few desolate birds. Our eyes followed the birds, coming from the east, going to the west, our eyes aching.

We anxiously asked each other, why hasn't it come yet?

Then ask two times, three times… everyone is asking, but no one is answering.

After a long silence, I asked tremblingly:

"Did something go wrong?"

"Maybe something went wrong."

"Impossible! The sacks are packed well, rice, squeeze it and it's rice, break a hole and look, and it's still rice, damn it ××! Knowing the secrets inside! I swear I don't believe it!"

"Ah! These days there are so many ×× inspectors on the road! Cavalry, cars, tanks, …If the secret is broken, alas! That's terrible! Terrible!"

Lao Lin kept sighing.

We lowered our heads and silently thought. Suddenly, two people came out of the pine forest, the trees were parted, brushing sound, turning from the field embankment onto the main road. A thin, yellow old man and a vigorous young man came towards us. The young man stopped and exclaimed, "Ah!" Our dream was broken by him.

The young man said:

"Confused! Confused! Alas! I forgot to bring that plaster (pass), it's not good to go to the city!"

The old man's face was so anxious that the veins on his forehead bulged out:

"You are so confused! Ah! Don't even think about entering the city!"

Shanghai Special

### Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association

— Tao Leqin

Continued Management Within the Concession

The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association was established on October 14th of the ninth year of the Republic of China. Its historical outline before the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China is recorded in the Shen Bao Yearbook and the Shanghai Municipal Yearbook, so I will not repeat it here to save space. What should be said here is the status of the Association after the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, its position in the Public Concession, and the characteristics of its political organization.

In April of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, due to the increase in members and the need for economic elections, its representative assembly resolved to amend the constitution. The term of office of its eighty-one representatives was changed from one year to two years; the executive committee was increased from twenty-two members to thirty-five members; the standing committee was increased from three members to five members; of the five directors attending the Municipal Council, three-fifths were selected to remain in office; and of the seven committee members, four-sevenths were selected to remain in office, in order to be familiar with the work and to have deep qualifications; the term of office remained one year.

As for the Association's position in the Public Concession, if viewed from the perspective of a politician, it is naturally equal to that of the Western Ratepayers' Association; if viewed from the principle of politics, there should be no room for discrimination. However, among Chinese and foreigners, there seem to be the following misunderstandings:

1.  That the Association has not yet obtained legal recognition.

2.  That the directors and committee members elected by the Association to attend the Municipal Council are representatives of the Chinese ratepayers who negotiate with the Municipal Council.

Such misunderstandings are naturally easy to occur due to historical and formal reasons. However, the principle of "no taxation without representation" is regarded as the golden rule by the great Anglo-Saxon nation, which is most abundant in political consciousness, and they would rather die than give up this second life. If taxpayers have the demand to participate in politics, then even with any great force, it is difficult to stop them. Therefore, the inaugural meeting of the Association was held at the Municipal Hall owned by the Municipal Council at the south end of Nanjing Road. Taking the unwritten constitution of England as an example, the Association has become a legal basis in the Public Concession with the same effect as the Western Ratepayers' Association, and it is an organization recognized by China and the countries concerned. Last year, the origin of the Chinese directors and committee members of the Municipal Council was specifically and clearly written into the charter of the Public Concession in accordance with the exchange of notes between the Chinese government and the representatives of the countries concerned. What is still considered regrettable is that the Association has not yet formally gone through the procedures of passing and approving the reports and budgets of the Municipal Council, so the root of this misunderstanding has not been completely eradicated. This is what is hoped that wise people concerned will strive to correct.

Regarding the second misunderstanding, the reason is that the Public Concession is regarded as an area governed by foreigners. In fact, it only allows foreigners to rent land in the designated area to build and do business. Therefore, all residents in the area, such as joint-stock companies, are all shareholders; the board of directors of the Municipal Council is equivalent to the board of directors of a joint-stock company; the actions of the board of directors of the Municipal Council are whole, inseparable, and jointly responsible, and they should not take inconsistent actions towards the outside world due to different nationalities. Just like the board of directors of a joint-stock company, they are jointly responsible to all shareholders. Once this purpose is clear, one can recognize that the directors and committee members elected by the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association to attend the Municipal Council are not representatives of the Chinese ratepayers who negotiate with the Municipal Council, but members of the Municipal Council. As for making appeals or requests to the Municipal Council on behalf of the Chinese ratepayers, the Association should bear its responsibility, and there should be absolutely no evasion.

The most important characteristic of the organization of a political group is to accommodate members from all aspects as much as possible, so that it can represent the opinions and wishes of all aspects as much as possible. If its organization can have this characteristic, it can achieve the effect of harmony, cooperation, and mutual assistance among political groups. On the contrary, if one or several aspects are treated differently, it will inevitably lead to uneasiness. The ultimate goal of politics is to seek the happiness of all members of the group, not just the happiness of a few or a certain group of people. For this reason, authoritative thinkers, politicians, and jurists in the world are writing books and expressing opinions, and they are proposing various suggestions for improving the organization of political groups.

Before the European War, the existing political organization in the world was the representative system, which had two types: representing population and representing locality, and they were divided into upper and lower houses to form a parliament. After the European War, influenced by the guild representative system of the British Confucian, mathematical philosopher Russell, the vocational representative system was gradually adopted. The representative system before the war was only horizontal, and there was no vertical aspect; after the war, it also covered the vertical aspect. However, after the European War, influenced by the slogan of "national self-determination" put forward by the US President Wilson, only the Soviet Union had the setting of representing the degree of the nation.

Wu Yugan praised the above-mentioned vertical and horizontal representative system in his essay in the Oriental Magazine. The organization of the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association had been implemented two years earlier; it shows that the matter belongs to the truth, and the actual theory must be consistent.

The members of the Association are divided into two types: group members and individual members. Group members include three types: commercial groups, hometown groups, and civic groups. Elections are divided into three groups: individual member group, hometown group (civic groups belong to it), and commercial group. All eighty-one representatives are elected by three groups, each electing one-third, that is, each group elects twenty-seven people. Individual members can be said to represent those who hold real estate worth more than seven hundred yuan, or who pay full land tax or house tax of more than fourteen yuan; civic groups can be said to represent the entire body of citizens; commercial groups can be said to represent business groups; hometown groups can be said to represent various gangs similar to nationalities. In this way, the representative assembly formed by the eighty-one representatives can be said to include the representatives of all Chinese in the Public Concession.

The organizational system of the Association is (1) Chinese ratepayers, (2) representative assembly, (3) executive committee, (4) standing committee, (5) chairman. Its activities are carried out in the following way: routine matters are handled with the approval of the chairman; important matters are decided by the standing committee meeting; more important matters are decided by the executive committee meeting; particularly important matters are decided by the representative assembly. All non-routine matters that have a time-sensitive relationship and must be handled urgently are approved and implemented directly by the chairman, and then submitted to the respective meetings for ratification.

So far, the Association has had a history of eighteen years, and it has encountered countless intertwined problems. The current situation is due to the fact that, in terms of people, Mr. Wang Rutang, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Li Fusun, Bei Songsun, Qian Xinzhi, Wu Yunzhai, Shi Liangcai, Xu Xinliu, Hu Mengjia, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiqing, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, (not all of them are listed), are keen on public welfare and have made continuous efforts; in terms of things, they have adopted the principle of justice and fairness, equal rights and obligations, and taken honest actions, seeking cooperation between Chinese and foreign taxpayers without prejudice to sovereignty, in order to enable the citizens within the boundary to obtain the happiness that human beings should have under the rule of law of the Municipal Council. With eighteen years of experience, the Association deeply feels that equal cooperation is not only a matter of municipal administration, but that all problems can be solved easily and that it is necessary. December 20, the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China

### Yesterday was New Year's Day, the Whole City Celebrated Vigorously with Flags; Commemoration of the Founding of the Republic of China; Citizens' Enthusiasm was Extremely High; Actively Promoting "One Dollar to Repay the Debt"

Yesterday was the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, New Year's Day. All sectors of the city celebrated with flags. Banks, customs, post offices, public organizations, schools, etc., all followed the custom of taking a holiday. Shops posted signs that read "National Calendar New Year's Day, Closed for One Day." The citizens' enthusiasm was extremely high. All sectors continued the "Economize to Rescue" movement to help refugees and support the government to achieve victory in the war of resistance and complete national reconstruction. The "One Dollar to Repay the Debt" movement also began yesterday, aiming to fulfill the citizens' duty, strengthen the belief of international friendly nations in our aid, and so on. Some school staff and students, as well as public organization members, took advantage of the New Year's holiday to visit various refugee shelters and express their condolences to the refugees who were displaced by the war.

### Banks Have Been on Vacation for Four Days Since Yesterday; Catching Up on Closing Accounts; Because the Market is Lively and Developing Abnormally; All Loans Issued After the War Can Be Recovered

After the member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association completed the annual closing accounts for the 27th year, they have been on vacation since yesterday, a total of four days. Internally, they are still working as usual, and extending the time to catch up on the closing accounts for the past year. It is expected to open for business on the 5th. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met a financial leader yesterday. According to the talk, after the war in Shanghai, factories and companies operating national goods businesses in the concessions were forced to stop work due to factories in the inland, while order was restored in the concessions, and the people avoiding Shanghai increased sharply. And the traffic in the inland gradually restored, so that the goods produced tend to be more than supply. The original stocks have been sold out, and increase production day and night. This abnormal development is really beyond the expectations of the general public. Because the market is lively, the loans issued by various banks can be recovered as scheduled. There are absolutely no bad debts in the new loans issued after the war. Therefore, all banks can obtain considerable surplus after the closing accounts.

### Customs Brokerage Firms and Companies Registration Procedures; Customs Notice Regulations

The Jianghai Customs has re-handled the registration of customs brokerage firms and companies. The Customs Commissioner Luo Fude had issued the No. 1636 notice. According to the Jianghai Customs, Qiu Weiqi, the deputy commissioner of the General Affairs Department of the Customs, has issued the No. 95 notice, saying that all customs brokerage firms and companies registered with the Customs should re-register at the registration office of the Department from January 1 to January 31, 28th year of the Republic of China.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Approved by the Ministry of Finance; The Guizhou Province's Salaries and Donations are Only Collected Once

The Ministry of Finance stated that according to the telegram from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the procedures for collecting provincial taxes in Guizhou Province are cumbersome, and merchants and the people do not know what to do, please find a way, etc. The Ministry immediately forwarded a letter to the Guangxi Provincial Government to check and reply that the Guizhou Province Salaries and Donations Bureau is located in Wuzhou, and the branch bureau is located in the whole county. All goods entering from Wuzhou are collected by the General Bureau, and those entering from the whole county are collected by the branch bureau. Only one collection is levied, which is implemented throughout the province without any hindrance. Since the implementation, merchants and the people have found it convenient, etc. The Ministry has approved and instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be informed.

### The Export of Chinese Tea is Quite Good; According to the Report of Mr. Duo Chun; The Sales of Japanese Tea Have Decreased Sharply

After the Ministry of Finance's Trade Adjustment Council implemented the control over the foreign trade of national black and green tea, it has achieved quite good results. According to the report of Mr. Wei Chun, the tea expert and consultant of the China Tea Company, according to the statistics of the World Tea Committee in London on the tea of various countries in the world, the data on China and Japan are as follows: From January to September of this year (last year), the sales of Chinese tea in various countries in the world reached 65,620,000 pounds, a decrease of only more than one million pounds compared with 66,676,600 pounds in the same period last year (the year before last). The sales of Japanese tea in the world market from January to September this year were only 21,643,000 pounds, a decrease of almost half compared with 38,852,000 pounds in the same period last year.

### The Ministry of Finance Issued a Circular; Strictly Prohibiting the Use of Coins; The Handling Fee for Collection and Exchange Increased to 15%; The Provincial Governments Should Declare the Government's Virtuous Intentions

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed to the provincial governments, saying that since the implementation of the legal currency, all payments and receipts of grain taxes and all public and private funds are limited to the legal currency, and cash is not allowed to be used. The Ministry issued a notice in November 24th year, and telegraphed to the municipal governments to follow it. At the same time, the Measures for Exchanging Legal Currency was promulgated, so that those who hold silver coins can exchange them for legal currency nearby, in order to unify. Our country is vast, and transportation is often inconvenient. There are still a few remote areas that use coins. Now, the Executive Yuan issued the proposal of the members of the National Political Council's first conference, Xu Baiyuan, etc., and clearly prohibited the use of coins in the second item of the third clause. If there are still people using coins as a medium of exchange in the inland, it should be expressly prohibited and ordered to be implemented. In order to collect silver coins and silver, and enrich the preparations, the Ministry has sent a letter to the joint office of the four banks of China, China, Communication, and Agriculture, and transferred it to the four banks. In the future, the handling fee for collecting and exchanging silver coins and silver will be increased to 15% (that is, for every 100 yuan collected and exchanged, a handling fee of 15 yuan will be given as an incentive. It is intended to promote the collection and exchange, and still benefit the people. It should be declared by the provincial and municipal governments the virtuous intentions of the government, and announce to the people that the use of coins is strictly prohibited. Those who hold silver coins and silver should quickly hand them over to the branches of the four banks of China, China, Communication, and Agriculture, or their entrusted agencies, to exchange them for legal currency for use, in order to purify the currency policy.

### Establishing a Southwest Economic Construction Committee; Engaging in the Development of Rich Resources; The Mineral Reserves in the Six Provinces are Very Rich; Inconvenient Transportation and Backward Industry are the Main Reasons

The Chinese government established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee to develop and construct the southwest and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. The relevant ministers and the chairmen of the southwest provinces were appointed as members. The preparations have been completed and the committee will be established in Chongqing on New Year's Day of the 28th year. In addition to the government's allocation of huge funds as capital, Hu Wenhu invested 50 million yuan, and the banks decided to assist in the completion. The details are as follows:

Agriculture

The total area of the six provinces is 260 million mu, and the cultivated area is 31.7 million mu, accounting for 15% of the total area. The situation in each province is the highest in Guangxi, accounting for 25%, and the lowest in Xuenan, accounting for 4%. Other provinces such as Guangdong account for 12%, Hunan accounts for 13%, Guizhou accounts for 8%, and Sichuan accounts for 15%. The main agricultural product is rice, with indica and japonica rice accounting for 47% of the national output. Among them, Guangdong Province ranks first, Sichuan Province ranks second, and Hunan Province ranks third. Although silk and tea are specialties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the southwest provinces are far behind. However, the silk of Sichuan and Guangdong, and the tea of Hunan and Yunnan are also quite famous. In addition, an important agricultural product that can be mentioned is tung oil. The annual output of Sichuan Province alone has increased to 600,000 dan. The cotton production is very small. Sichuan has 750,000 dan, Hunan has 400,000 dan, and Guangdong has only 6,000 dan.

Industry

Due to the competition from foreign goods and foreign factories, the industrial foundation is extremely weak. This situation is even more true in the southwest provinces. Although there are few foreigners who set up factories in these six provinces, the competition from imported foreign goods is very fierce. The main reason for the industrial backwardness in the southwest provinces is the backwardness of transportation. The supply of raw materials and the circulation of products are inconvenient, so it is difficult for industry to gain a foothold. The largest modern industry is the yarn factory. There are only two in the southwest, namely the Guangdong Textile Factory and the Hunan First Textile Factory. The newly established ones are the Hunan Hengzhong Textile Company, the Sichuan Jiabin Textile Factory, and the Yunnan Textile Factory. The flour mills are the Hunan First Factory in Changsha and the Changde Xinxin Flour Mill. However, sugar mills are more developed, but they are also limited to Sichuan and Guangdong provinces. Alcohol factories are mainly in Guangdong and Guangxi, and Hunan and Sichuan are also planning. Sichuan has the most match factories, with a total of 46 factories, Hunan and Guangxi each have one factory, Guangdong has 15 factories, and Yunnan has 18 factories. In addition, there are a total of 200 factories for papermaking, leather making, silk reeling, sulfuric acid, salt making, rubber, cement, and machinery.

Mining Industry

The southwest provinces have all kinds of mineral deposits, and the reserves are very rich, including gold, silver, steel, iron, tin, tungsten, manganese, antimony, zinc, lead, coal, petroleum, and salt. In particular, tin, tungsten, manganese, and antimony mines occupy a very high position in the world. However, coal and iron are not as prosperous as the northern provinces. (1) Iron ore reserves of 39,616,000 tons, (2) Coal reserves of 1,553,500,000 tons, (3) Manganese annual output of 31,200 tons, (4) Tungsten annual output of 1,825 tons, (5) Gold annual output of 31,206 taels, (6) Silver annual output of 121,504 taels, (7) Zinc annual output of 11,410 tons, (8) Tin annual output of 7,398 tons, (9) Antimony annual output of about 13,260 tons, (10) Lead annual output of 6,670 tons, (11) Bismuth annual output of 1,305 tons, (12) Petroleum annual output of 400 barrels.

Transportation

The railway money in the six provinces is not enough and lacks connections, and other means of transportation have not reached perfection. Therefore, if you want to develop the rich resources of the southwest, you should first engage in construction. (1) Railways: The railways that the government has recently started to construct are the Sichuan Xufu to Yunnan Kunming Sichuan-Yunnan Railway, the Yunnan Kunming to British Burma Yunnan-Burma Railway, the Hunan Zhuzhou to Guizhou Guiyang Hunan-Guizhou Railway, and the Guizhou Guiyang to Yunnan Kunming Yunnan-Guizhou Railway. Those in the plan include the Sichuan-Kang, Gui-Yue, Gui-Qian, Guangdong-Gui, Baoji-Chengdu, etc. (2) Highways: The southwest highways are more developed than other provinces. The six provinces have a total of 27,000 kilometers of roads that can be used for traffic, accounting for a quarter of the country, such as the Gan-Dian Road, Chuan-Gui Road, Gui-Min Road, Xiang-Gui Road, Chuan-Xiang Road, Chuan-Dian Road, Yue-Gan Road, E-Xiang Road, Xiang-E Road, Gua-Dian Road, Shaan-Kang Road, Gui-Yue Road, Chuan-E Road, etc. The recently completed one is the Dian-Mian Road.

### The Banking Industry Received a Telegram from the Ministry; The Contract for Receiving Vouchers is Approved for Extension; If the Situation is Stable, a Notice Can Be Given to End Early; 50% of the Principal and Interest of the Central China Loan Can Be Used to Offset the Amount Received

The banks and money houses have received the vouchers from the four banks of China, China, Communication, and Agriculture. After the Ministry of Finance ordered to end them after the expiration of the period, they were changed to the method of pledging funds and redeeming them in installments. The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association, after consultation, believed that due to the actual difficulties, the Ministry was telegraphed to request maintenance of finance and further extension. The reporter learned from the banking industry yesterday that the two industry associations have received a telegram from the Ministry, saying that the difficulties stated in the telegram are still true. The Ministry has approved the four banks of China, China, Communication, and Agriculture to reluctantly extend the period for another year according to the original amount. The period will not be extended again after the expiration. However, if the situation is stable and the bond market is stable during this one-year period, the issuing bank can notify the voucher receiving bank to end early two months in advance. The voucher receiving bank can also send a letter to the issuing bank two months in advance to agree to end early. The principal of the guaranteed preparation bond, which is drawn, will still be collected by the issuing bank in full according to the extension method of the previous year to offset the same amount of receipts. The interest on the bond will be collected by the issuing bank to offset the same amount of receipts, and the remaining half will still be received by the voucher receiving bank, so as to take both into account. In addition to the letter to the branches of the four joint headquarters, the relevant parties are requested to be informed and transferred to negotiate.

### China's Foreign Trade; The Import Surplus Has Sharply Decreased in Recent Years; Gradually Improved After the Adjustment of the Trade Council; Promoting Exports to Make the Foreign Exchange Base Solid

### Municipal Group Fundraising Committee, Broadcasting Conference Closed Last Night, The Seven-Day Conference Achieved Good Results, Fundraising Teams Continue Fundraising Work

The broadcasting fundraising conference organized by the Municipal Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has ended as scheduled and was declared closed last night. Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhongying, and others delivered closing speeches, expressing gratitude to all sectors. The seven-day conference achieved very good fundraising results. Each fundraising team will continue fundraising work from today. The details are recorded as follows:

End of Broadcasting, Continued Fundraising

Yesterday was the last day of the association's broadcasting fundraising. Due to the damage to the Xinxin Radio Station's equipment, the event was temporarily moved to the China-West Radio Station and broadcast jointly by major radio stations. The program included Suzhou Tanci, storytelling, and flower-world schoolgirls. All famous flowers from the city's northern district were mobilized to participate, displaying their beautiful voices and doing their utmost to raise funds. Leaders who gave speeches on the radio yesterday included Wang Wanbai, Zhou Bangjun, Jiang Yiping, and Zhu Qizhen. At 12 o'clock last night, association chairman Yu Qiaqing, municipal group chairman Lin Kanghou, and general manager Liu Zhongying delivered closing speeches and immediately declared the conference closed. During the seven-day conference, the enthusiasm of all sectors in adopting refugees was consistently high, resulting in very good adoption results. Accurate and detailed figures are still awaiting statistics from the association for publication. It is vaguely heard that the adoption funds from all sectors have indeed exceeded 100,000 yuan. Furthermore, the association has established 50 fundraising teams, and the second step is to promote these fundraising teams. It is heard that work will begin soon.

Yu Qiaqing and Others Deliver Closing Speeches

At 12 o'clock last night, association chairman Yu Qiaqing delivered a closing speech, expressing deep gratitude to all sectors for supporting the relief work. Municipal group chairman Lin Kanghou delivered a closing speech, stating that this association held a broadcasting fundraising conference to promote the refugee adoption movement. It was fortunate to have all major radio stations in the city generously provide their facilities, and the stations' staff generously allowed programs, as well as all the city's opera stars, celebrities, members of the film industry, performing arts circles, and famous flowers from the northern district, to participate in broadcasting special programs. Leaders of the performing arts circles took turns giving reports daily, joining in the good cause and benefiting the disaster victims. This is greatly admired. All the philanthropists generously donated and enthusiastically participated in the adoption movement. After the donation statistics are completed, a separate notice will be published in the newspaper to express thanks. For now, on behalf of the refugees, I extend my deepest gratitude. General Manager Liu Zhongying's speech focused on the following points: (1) A total thank you for the continuous generous donations from philanthropists from all sectors and the enthusiastic support for the broadcasting conference during the seven days of the broadcasting conference. (2) The refugee adoption donations are extremely complex. Some adopt for one year, some for half a year, some for three months, and some until the shelter closes. As for the donations, some have been paid in full at once, and some are paid in installments. Statistics are currently being compiled separately. Once the statistics are completed, the association will publish them in the newspaper. If there are any errors, please notify us for correction. (3) The commemorative badges for philanthropists who adopt refugees, as well as the names and origins of the adopted refugees, are now also being compiled. Once the procedures are completed, they will be sent or notified for collection. (4) Adopting refugees is a more widespread and long-lasting relief method because saving two yuan per month can save one refugee. Most people have the ability to participate in adoption, and the terms are divided into three months, half a year, and one year, so that the adopted refugees can also receive more lasting benefits. Although our association's broadcasting fundraising has come to an end, the fundraising adoption movement will not stop here. We still have 50 fundraising teams to continue working to ensure that all 100,000 refugees in this city have the opportunity to be adopted. Therefore, I sincerely hope that philanthropists from all sectors who have not yet adopted will continue to adopt, and those who have already adopted will persuade their relatives and friends to adopt, and jointly complete this refugee adoption movement. (5) For any inquiries, the association's address is Room 414, Xingye Building, Beijing Road, Jiangxi Road Intersection, telephone number 18533. Furthermore, Zhu Qizhen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Group, delivered a speech, hoping that all sectors would continue to work hard and complete the adoption movement.

Summary of Previous Speeches

The day before yesterday was the sixth day of the Refugee Relief Association Municipal Group Fundraising Committee. Leaders from all sectors gathered at the Xinxin Radio Station to give speeches. Due to space limitations yesterday, it was not possible to publish all of them. The summary is recorded as follows: Guo Shun's speech stated that wealthy families should slightly reduce their enjoyment consumption, and middle-class people should make appropriate adoptions according to their financial capacity, which will surely have a significant effect, directly saving the suffering compatriots and indirectly cultivating the country's strength. Le Gengbao's speech stated that according to the current situation at sea, places such as bars, hotels, dance halls, and entertainment venues are even more lively than before, but I am not here to oppose them. What I hope is that you will save unnecessary and unwarranted expenses and adopt more refugees, which is truly immeasurable merit. Key points of the speech by Li Ze, General Manager of Xinxin Company: (1) As the war zone expands, funds are being transferred inland to relieve Shanghai refugees, which should be the responsibility of Shanghai citizens. (2) Refugees are victims of disasters for the country. Foreigners are self-rescuing, and Chinese people should work harder. (3) Helping refugees is of great importance and profound significance to the national and social mission. (4) I hope that all sectors, especially fellow villagers, will adopt refugees for the long term. (5) While living and working in peace and contentment, we should also help others. Otherwise, social problems will arise. (Omitted)

### Meida and Tangsai, Two Ships, Permitted to Combine with Wan and Dinghai

The Hana, Haifu, Shantai, Gaodeng, and Tangbei, five ships operating between Shanghai and Taiwan, Wan, and Dinghai, have been temporarily prohibited from docking due to the handling of ship registration for a long time, and have not been able to resume operations, resulting in the interruption of passenger and cargo transportation. The Meida and Tangsai, two ships operating between Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Qian, have been permitted by the authorities to combine with Wan and Dinghai. Therefore, passengers and cargo from Shanghai to Dinghai can now be loaded onto ships operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route to Haimen and transferred to Meida and Tangsai to Dinghai.

### After the Shanghai Customs Was Seized, Remittances to the Government Were Suspended, No Remittances Have Been Made Since July of Last Year, Tax Rates Were Reduced, and Savings Were Changed to Japanese Banks Under Duress

Shanghai, with its superior location, convenient transportation, and thriving industry, is the center of trade and the hub of economy in the country, the only major port in the Far East. The import of foreign goods and the export of domestic goods are the best in the country's customs. When the war first broke out, due to the impact of the war, inland transportation was interrupted, resulting in an unusual decline in trade. Now that order has been restored within the concession, trade has also improved. In November of last year, the total value of imports and exports increased to 62,830,407 yuan, while the total value of imports and exports in the country in the same month was 141,400,614 yuan, with Shanghai Customs accounting for nearly one-half. However, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has been seized by the Japanese since July 1st of last year. Tax rates have been reduced for the import of Japanese goods, and customs revenue has been changed to be deposited in the Japanese Shokin Bank. It was also forced to change the flag to the "Five Colors" pseudo-flag. As for the taxes that Jianghai Customs should remit to the government, apart from the remittance in June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, totaling 1,180,171.65 yuan, no remittances have been made since July, which proves that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has undoubtedly been seized by the Japanese.

### Norwegian Minister Returns to Shanghai, Will Soon Go to Japan to Resume His Post

The Shanghai Times reported that Norwegian Minister Colin, who has served in China and Japan, left Tokyo for Bangkok two months ago at the invitation of the Siamese government to attend the ceremony for the young king's return to the capital. He has recently arrived in Shanghai from Bangkok and is expected to stay in Shanghai for a week and meet with Norwegian expatriates in this port. According to those who met with Colin yesterday (31st), he jokingly said that he represents Norway in China and Japan, and some people make fun of him for this, but he always has a prepared answer for this, that is, Norway is completely neutral. Colin is returning to Tokyo to resume his post, but he is quite happy to have an opportunity to meet old friends in Shanghai again. According to Colin, his first decision to come to the Far East was during the Russo-Japanese War, the second was during World War I, and this decision came shortly before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, Colin told people that he has come to the Far East twice, and each time there has been a war.

### Former Russian Customs Commissioner in Beiping Released After Arrest, Will Come to Shanghai on Japanese Ship on the 4th

Mr. Yanuofanlev, a Russian expatriate who has held important positions in the Chinese Customs and served as an advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and is now promoted to Customs Commissioner of Beiping Customs, still lives in Beiping after resigning. He was suddenly detained by the puppet organization of North China on December 22. The reason for his arrest, initially rumored, was resistance to the order of the North China White Russian Anti-Communist Alliance, as he was unwilling to pay the taxes forcibly levied by the North China White Russian Anti-Communist Alliance. According to the nephew of Canovanlev (his nephew works for the Shanghai Far East Export Company), he received a telegram from his uncle in Tianjin yesterday stating that he has fortunately been released and will take the Tangshan Maru ship of the Nisshin Company to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 29th. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 4th or 5th of this month. In the near future, he may travel to Europe. It is heard that Canovanlev's release was due to his nephew writing to the North China Customs authorities in Shanghai requesting special negotiations.

### British Rear Admiral Holt Visits the Commander of the Merchant Corps

The Chinese-English newspaper reported that British Rear Admiral Holt of the Yangtze River Fleet formally visited Colonel Hang Pei, Commander of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps, before 11:00 yesterday (31st). A squad of the White Russian team of the International Merchant Corps formed a guard of honor and lined up at the Public Works Department. According to reports, Rear Admiral Holt has been stationed on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River for more than 16 months and returned to Shanghai from Hankou on the HMS Mantis on December 24.

### Wangdian Post Office in Zhejiang Resumes Business Yesterday, Limited to Ordinary Express Letters and Registration for the Time Being

The Wangdian Third-Class B-Level Post Office along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been prepared since the Zhejiang Postal Administration and the Shanghai Postal Administration jointly handled the resumption of business. It was decided to resume business yesterday, limited to ordinary, express, and registered mail. Small parcels are also accepted up to 6 kilograms. As for remittances and large parcels, they are still being prepared. Once negotiations are completed, they can be accepted.

### Public Works Department Protects Slave Girls, Principles Passed, Does Not Recognize Slave Girl Status, and Pays Attention to Buying and Selling Transfers

Keeping slave girls is opposed by the international community. Due to long-standing habits in China, many middle and upper-class families still keep maids. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession believes that this matter is related to humanity, so it has established a Child Protection Section, and hired Ms. Xinder, Director of the Factory Affairs Section, to serve concurrently as the section chief and also as the protector of slave girls, in order to rescue servants and respect humanity. After repeated research, and with the approval of the Board of Directors, two principles of protection have been formulated: (1) The Bureau should, in accordance with the increasingly developed concept in other places, not recognize the status of slave girls, or any status similar to slavery. (This principle implies that slave girls should not be registered separately.) (2) The Bureau should also, as in other places, pay serious attention to children and young people who are transferred, and use all possible means to ensure that the transfer is reported to the Bureau's responsible personnel, and try to protect the transferred person, in order to show the Bureau's sense of responsibility.

### Japanese Troops in Pudong Patrol at Night, Suddenly Ambushed by Chinese Troops, Fierce Battle for Two Hours, Chinese Troops Retreat to the Southeast

On the evening of the lunar New Year's Eve (i.e., the night before), at 8:00 p.m., a fierce guerrilla warfare occurred near Nanyangjing Bridge, south of Yangjing Town, Pudong. The Japanese troops were ambushed and suffered heavy casualties. At that time, a platoon of the Third Battalion of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Yangjing, numbering about 20 or 30 people, patrolled near Nanyangjing Bridge at night and was suddenly ambushed and surrounded by 70 or 80 Chinese guerrillas. A fierce battle raged in the dark for an hour. The villagers there were extremely panicked. The number of Japanese casualties is unknown, but it is known that very few escaped. Subsequently, the Third Battalion headquarters near the Fujia Catholic Church urgently dispatched 70 or 80 reinforcements in four trucks to Nanyangjing Bridge for retaliation. The two sides fought fiercely again for a while, and the Chinese troops retreated to the southeast. The Japanese troops were furious and arrested the villagers who were walking at night, interrogating them one by one. Those with fake "citizen certificates" were detained until midnight before being released. More than ten civilians without "certificates" were identified as guerrillas and taken back to the battalion headquarters together for severe beatings and interrogations. The outcome is unknown.

### Japanese Puppets Closed the Traffic on the Huangpu River Yesterday

Recently, Chinese guerrilla troops in the suburbs of Shanghai have been exceptionally active and have launched attacks from time to time, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese troops. Because yesterday was the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, the Japanese puppets were afraid that the brave Chinese guerrillas would take the opportunity to attack, so they temporarily closed the traffic on the Huangpu River yesterday. All ships to and from Nanmatou, Damatou, Pudong, the Concession, Wusong, Gaoqiao, and other areas were suspended. It has not yet been decided whether they will be able to sail today.

### Amateur Group Fundraising Committee, Appointed Fundraising Team Leaders, Actively Promoting Fundraising Work

### The Concession Authorities Strictly Prevent Gambling and Opium; Long-Term Blockade of the Western Shanghai Area; Traffic Around Gambling Dens is Completely Blocked; Smuggling of Drugs Gradually Disappears

The authorities of the Public Concession, seeing that opium dens and gambling tables were rampant in western Shanghai, and robberies were rampant, specially constructed barbed wire obstacles at various entrances and exits to cut off traffic and maintain law and order. The details are as follows:

Blocking Gambling Dens

In the extra-settlement road area of western Shanghai, there are no fewer than dozens of large and small gambling tables. Hooligans and gangsters frequently enter and exit, resulting in a loss of discipline and unrest. Robberies and extortion with bombs are also endless. Nearby residents often suffer. Now, during the Lunar New Year, merchants routinely collect debts, and traffic is frequent, making this place a dreaded route. In view of this, the police authorities, in order to cut off the traffic to the gambling dens, specially erected barbed wire and other obstacles at the entrances of various roads and lanes in the adjacent extra-settlement areas, blocking the surroundings of the gambling dens so that they could not directly reach the concession. Only narrow passages were left at important entrances and exits, allowing pedestrians to pass sideways. Armed detectives are dispatched daily to patrol in shifts. Anyone with suspicious behavior is searched. Strict enforcement in recent days has been quite effective. The gambling dens have become desolate, and many are in a state of having few visitors.

Eliminating Drug Trafficking

After the opium public sale was implemented in the suburbs of Shanghai, the Japanese puppet regime often secretly transported drugs through the concession for convenience of transportation, with the extra-settlement road area of western Shanghai as a necessary route. The matter was discovered by the concession authorities, who strictly blocked the area and cut off important traffic, adding barbed wire and the like to prevent cars from passing. Drug trafficking cases have indeed disappeared. Now, the concession authorities have resolved to block the western Shanghai area for a long time to prevent the spread of drug flames and affect the concession.

### Le Jia Old Shop, Beijing Shuren Hall, Grand Opening

The Shanghai branch of Beijing Tongrentang Le Jia Old Shop Shuren Hall Pharmacy, located at 751 Nanjing Road, officially opened yesterday. Hundreds of guests from all walks of life arrived and were warmly greeted and given a tour by the hall. On display were acupuncture bronze figures, a full set of monkey bones, precious yellow-haired deer antlers, high-quality ginseng, top-grade donkey-hide gelatin, and other items transported from the Beijing headquarters, a dazzling array. The hall also announced to the guests that it adheres to the consistent principle of Beijing Tongrentang, selling various pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs, all from secret recipes, carefully prepared and refined, with genuine goods at fair prices, being realistic and pragmatic, and never being false. It is also heard that Mr. Le Shusun, the manager of the hall, also serves as the manager of Beijing Tongrentang, presiding over all important matters. Due to inconvenient transportation, he could not come to thank the guests in person, expressing his apologies. Afterwards, all the guests were invited to the second floor for tea and refreshments, crowded and lively, a grand occasion.

### Opening of Hongkou, Negotiations Continue; Japanese Side Agrees to Restore Part First; Implemented from March 1st This Year

Regarding the issue of opening the northeast area of Hongkou, which has been under negotiation for more than a year, representatives of the Public Works Department met with the Japanese military on Wednesday of last week to discuss everything. The Japanese side has agreed to tentatively open the area within the scope of Broadway Road to Tilanqiao from March 1st this year, with the Public Works Department handling registration procedures and issuing residence permits. The police force under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department will also be responsible for security. If the situation after the opening is good, further discussions will be held on the method of restoring full police powers. The area of the pilot opening is not large, and the Yangshupu, Hansbury Road, Wusong Road, and North Sichuan Road areas are not included. However, the negotiations that have been deadlocked for several months have been opened up by this change. Representatives from both sides have also scheduled to continue negotiations from the 5th of this month.

### Shanghai Race Club to Hold Three Consecutive Days of Races Starting Today; New Year Grand Champion Tickets to be Drawn the Day After Tomorrow; Ticket Sales Outlets Added During Races; No Admission Tickets Required to Purchase

The Shanghai Race Club's New Year Grand Prix will begin today and will be held for three days. There will be eight races today, and nine races each tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. The program is wonderful and rare in previous sessions. The most anticipated is the seventh Grand Champion race on the day after tomorrow. The New Year Grand Champion tickets, since their release, have been selling very well due to their simple procedures and excellent methods. Each full ticket has eleven strips and costs ten yuan in national currency. Retail price is one yuan per strip. The club, considering that those who want to buy Grand Champion tickets during the races are often inconvenienced by the restriction that "admission tickets are required to enter the venue," has specially set up a ticket sales office at the archway of the club at 304A Mahe Road (opposite the gate on Route Mandalane) during the races for convenience, which also sells the Grand Champion tickets to benefit all sectors of society. The time is from 11:30 am to 4:30 pm today and tomorrow, and from 11:30 am to 2:00 pm the day after tomorrow. At other times, the lottery ticket department of the club at 304 Mahe Road will continue to sell them as usual.

### Vegetable Supply is Abundant and Prices are Slightly Lower than Before

Yesterday, the supply of vegetables at the 16th Pier, Laozha Bridge, and other places in Shanghai was abundant, so prices were slightly lower than in the previous few days. Chinese cabbage (commonly known as bok choy) was 1.40 yuan per 100 jin (market weight), Taihu radish was 1.70 yuan per 100 jin, spinach was 3.50 yuan per 100 jin, collapse vegetables were 4 yuan per 100 jin, and yellow sprouts (also known as gelatinous vegetables) were 5 yuan per 100 jin. However, Chinese cabbage and radish still sell for four or five cents per jin in the small vegetable market.

### Citizens' Group Standing Committee Suggests: Requesting Real Estate Owners to Contribute to Disaster Relief; Standard: 1% of Monthly Rent; Term: Please Limit to Three Months

Li Jinzhang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, suggested yesterday: "Respected Sir, there is no better way to raise funds for refugee relief than through real estate. It is estimated that there are at least 500,000 houses in the two special districts of Shanghai. The current development of the real estate industry is unprecedented since Shanghai became a commercial port. It is proposed that landlords deduct 1% of the monthly rent, for a period of three months, that is, deducting one yuan for every 100 yuan of rent, as expenses for refugee relief. This is like a hair from an ox for the landlords, but accumulating sand into a tower. The standing committee of this association can notify all tenants, that is, second landlords, to pay in advance on a monthly basis, and the association will issue receipts (it is best to pay in one lump sum) to be deducted when the rent is paid each month. The collection method will be to have the association specially dispatch several collectors with photo identification and badges, and use two-part receipts with stamps as receipts, and report to the court and police department for record, to avoid misunderstandings. At the same time, in the current state, eight out of ten are second landlords, so whether we are subletting the remaining house, please each tenant donate one yuan when paying rent to the second landlord, but only for one month. This small amount is not a significant burden for the payer, and the refugees will benefit greatly. This is my humble opinion, please make a public decision."

Shipping Companies Pay for Refugees

Regarding the proposal for the shipping industry in this city to contribute to refugee relief, the shipping industry association invited various shipping companies to a meeting and decided to pay a 1% donation from salaries, and then allocate 5/1000 from business (ie, income from passenger and freight fares) to be used for this purpose. This method was decided to be implemented from November, with a limit of one year. Currently, the shipping companies that have successively arrived in November to pay this business contribution donation include: Zhengde Company's Shantai Wheel, Hualun Foreign Company's Glen, Batula, Enji, Haida, Carrie, Dapu, Pina, Liwuduo, Oleve Wheel, Lihe Foreign Company's Moufu, Haifu Wheel, Yihua Foreign Company's Baoli Wheel, Meili Company's Meifa, Meida Wheel, Far East Company's Hana Wheel, Huamei Company's Tang Wheel Department, Sino-Italian Company's Deping, Ende, Kangshayi Wheel, and Taichang Foreign Company, Shanghai Company, Dongli Company, Changyun Company, Far East Shipping Company, etc. The association has reported to the Refugee Relief Association to publish a thank you notice. Others who have not yet paid include Lulin Foreign Company's Gaodeng, Feikang Wheel, Atlantic Company's Hailong Wheel, Haibi Foreign Company's Lisha, Kaisideng Wheel, Wanguo Shipping Company's Xinde, Minhe, Lude, Wanguo, Baode Wheel, Ke Company, Haikang, Luan Wheel, Qierli Foreign Company's Lima, Paide Wheel, etc. The shipping industry association is currently sending separate letters to urge payment.

Hardware Association Sends Donations

The Hardware and Parts Industry Association of this city sent a letter to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday, saying: "Respected Sir, the association has collected refugee donations from the industry for December, which have been collected in full, including salary 1/100 contribution from 25 households totaling 81 yuan and 4 cents, and monthly donations from 35 households totaling 300 yuan, totaling 381 yuan and 4 cents. It was paid to the Nanjing Road branch of Siming Bank on December 27, and a receipt number 1219 was obtained and stored in the association.

However, she requested to take a photo with the 50 refugees she sponsored. It is heard that the association is deeply impressed by the enthusiasm of the lady and can arrange the photography. Once the photography is completed, the lady's name and address will be announced to arouse social sympathy.

Chen Jilin's Birthday Celebrations Aid Disaster Relief

Mr. Chen Jilin, former director and acting consul of the Overseas Chinese Association in Hamburg, Germany, has been engaged in charitable activities since returning to China after resigning from his position, sparing no effort in his support.

However, Mr. Chen, considering the severity of the national crisis, did not dare to make a show and, seeing the pitiful situation of the refugees in Shanghai, added all the birthday gifts sent by his relatives and friends to the banquet expenses, and transferred them all to charitable causes, totaling 5,500 yuan, which has been handed over to Mr. Jin Tingsun in full, asking him to forward it to the Refugee Relief Association and various charitable organizations.

This is the first fatal tragedy of the New Year. The Huishan police station is currently investigating, but the Japanese military authorities have obtained all the details. The vehicle suddenly caught fire on Dongxi Huade Road, Yuanfang Road, immediately spreading to the sidecar, and a Japanese military officer sitting in the sidecar was unable to escape and was burned. As of press time, the results of the police investigation were still unknown. The vehicle has been identified as number 16.

### A Car Crushes a Merchant to Death; A Dung Cart Driver

Wang Azeng, a native of Suzhou, who was over fifty years old, made a living pulling a dung cart. At about 5:00 am yesterday morning, Wang was pulling his cart near Suzhou Road and Zhejiang Road when a black-plated car, number 12231, suddenly sped over. Wang was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, suffering severe head injuries and on the verge of death.

He died at noon.

### Sale of Broadway Mansion Fails

It is said that the negotiations for the sale of the mansion were based on 5.5 million yuan in cash, or 3 million yuan in cash, with the remainder to be paid within a time limit. However, the transaction was not successfully negotiated, and there is reason to believe that the negotiations have failed.

### Avenue Joffre Renovation; Shops Must All Install Show Windows; New Licenses Valid for the First Half of the Year

The French Concession authorities, in order to enhance the appearance of Avenue Joffre, have specially stipulated that, from January 1, 1939, all shops on the section from Route Ghisi to Route Hogue must be renovated with Western-style show window facades. The procedures to be adopted are: (1) For newly established stores, the store owner must install Western-style show windows on the facade of each store before being allowed to obtain a business license. (2) For existing stores, the business license they should obtain for 1939 will be valid for only six months (ie, from January 1, 1939, to June 30). During these six months, each store must find a way to renovate appropriate and beautiful show windows. If the facade is not renovated after June 30, the business license will not be renewed from July 1. After the implementation of this method, it is expected that the beautiful appearance of Avenue Joffre will be realized in half a year.

### Coal Gas Pipe Explodes; Worker Poisoned to Death; Wu Guixiang Dies Tragically

Wu Linxiang, a young worker aged 19, who lived at 28 Gaoshou Lane, Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, was a coppersmith at the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory at 20 Route Masnan in the French Concession. From 17:00 on December 30th of last year, while working in the factory workshop, the installed natural gas pipe, due to years of corrosion, exploded, causing the coal gas to spill out, filling the room with a foul smell. Wu happened to be nearby and was poisoned by the coal gas, fainting and falling to the ground, unconscious. Chen Shouan, a Shaoxing native and colleague, discovered this and told the accounting room of the pharmaceutical factory, who sent Wu to Guangci Hospital. Due to severe poisoning, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:00 pm the next afternoon. The hospital reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fugai branch for examination. Due to the New Year's holiday, a report will be made to the court on the 4th for inspection before coffin burial.

### Two Opium Dens Raided on Ningxing Street

The French Concession police authorities, at about 10:00 am yesterday, ordered Chinese and French detectives to raid an opium den at the entrance of Baoyu Lane, 104 Ningxing Street, on the second floor of the Lin Juxing Rice Cake Shop. The den owner, Little Suzhou, had already escaped, and only four opium smokers, two opium dealers, two opium pipes, seventy or eighty opium bubbles, and opium ash were seized. They then went to the front building and raided another house, arresting the deaf monk couple who owned the house, four opium smokers, and opium lamps and pipes, and brought the people and evidence to the police station to be sent to the court for interrogation.

### Five Sons, Only Wants the Fourth Son to Support; Father, Brothers, Mother, and Son in Court; Persuasion Ineffective, Continued Hearing Scheduled

Cao Wenyu, a local residing at 5 Sanchengfang, Maibaige Road, who works at Taichang Company, whose father Cao Yuxiang is seventy years old and has five sons, Wenyu is the fourth, and has a young son Jin Gen, who was born to his stepmother Shen, the parents abandoned the elder two, three, and other three sons, and did not ask for support, but filed a lawsuit against Wenyu alone, requesting a ruling to pay 2,550 yuan in legal tender for support fees before November 27, and 50 yuan per month for support fees after November, and requested litigation assistance and exemption from litigation fees. After being sued, Wenyu, based on the fact that his old father and stepmother's claims about his economic situation were greatly exaggerated and not true, hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to submit a defense, stating that the plaintiff's claim that he lived extravagantly and possessed huge assets was not true. He once suffered the pain of unemployment, and then worked at Taichang Company, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan, which was only enough to barely maintain his daily life, and he has no savings to this day. As for the claim that he profited from transporting food, it is even more unfounded. Although he once jointly invested with a friend to purchase wheat, the result was a loss of several hundred yuan. The living expenses of his father have always been shared by his brothers. He initially paid 5 yuan per month, and from January of this year, increased it to 10 yuan, without interruption. Now his father listens to the slander of his stepmother Shen and others, and is fooled by others, resulting in a family dispute caused by instigation and alienation, which is deeply regrettable. Since he has never interrupted his father's living expenses, how can there be any abandonment? As for Shen, she is actually his father's mistress, and Jin Gen is Shen's illegitimate child, so they have always rented a house outside and lived separately and have never lived with him. According to Article 1114 of the Civil Code, Shen and Jin Gen have no right to claim alimony. These people know that they cannot file a lawsuit for alimony because they do not have family status, so they do not hesitate to instigate the old father to file a lawsuit, trying to deceive, but they do not know that this claim is obviously unfounded in law and should be immediately rejected. He also requested that his elder brothers Cao Wensheng and Cao Wusheng be summoned to court to prove the monthly living expenses given to their father by the two. Peng Shi, judge of the First Special District Court, summoned the father and sons to a hearing and felt that it was contrary to ethics for family members to confront each other in court. He advised both parties to resolve the dispute peacefully and end the litigation as soon as possible. Because the plaintiff Cao Yuxiang and his wife Shen were unwilling to compromise, the peaceful negotiations did not make progress. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Judge Peng continued the hearing and summoned the plaintiff Qi Yuxiang's eldest son Wensheng, who had complied with the summons. According to his testimony, Shen and his father lived together and had children without being married. Cao was old and deaf, and Shen translated Wensheng's testimony to Cao, who angrily scolded Wensheng in a loud voice. Later, the defendant presented a newspaper, claiming that the report on the case in the newspaper was quite different from the previous hearing. The plaintiff deliberately sent the newspaper to the company where he worked, almost causing him to lose his job. He now wishes to increase the monthly alimony by five yuan, totaling fifteen yuan. The court then advised the defendant to pay twenty yuan per month and reach a settlement in court. However, the plaintiff Cao Yuxiang, after being informed by Shen, protested again, saying that this amount could not maintain the lives of the three of them. Shen also added that they had been living on debt for years and owed another two or three thousand yuan, which also needed to be repaid. Judge Peng verified the statements and felt that the claims of the two parties were far apart and the advice was not followed. Therefore, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for a continued hearing on January 16.

### Wang Yuying, a Worshiper of Money, After Obtaining 50,000 Gold from Her Husband, Sues for Her Daughter's Educational Expenses and Seeks Litigation Relief

The family of Sun Zhizhai, the owner of Huizhong Hotel and a native of Wuxi, has been involved in lawsuits in recent years. This one subsided and another arose, with few peaceful days. Not long ago, Sun's concubine Wang Yuying filed a lawsuit against him over living expenses. After some mediation, Sun gave her 50,000 yuan and the concubine dropped the case. Since the settlement of that case, the concubine, in her capacity as the guardian of her daughter Fengyin, hired lawyer Li Mian and filed a lawsuit against Sun Zhizhai, Sun Bosheng, Sun Guangyuan, and others in the First Special District Court, seeking 70,000 yuan in legal tender for Fengyin's educational expenses, claiming that Fengyin is now thirteen years old and the defendants should be responsible for her future education and upbringing expenses. She requested a ruling to pay the sued amount and, because she has no financial resources to pay the litigation fees, begged for the favor of litigation relief and exemption from the litigation fees. The court, based on the pleading, held that it was necessary to conduct a detailed investigation of the plaintiff's request for litigation relief. Judge Peng Shi opened the hearing on the afternoon of yesterday and summoned Wang Yuying, mother of the plaintiff Sun Fengyin, to court for investigation. Judge Peng asked why, since the previous lawsuit resulted in her obtaining 50,000 yuan not long ago, and the huge sum should still exist, she was requesting litigation assistance. Since she is not truly without resources, her request is difficult to approve. The woman confessed that although she had received 50,000 yuan before, it was used to repay debts and there was nothing left. She was truly unable to pay the litigation fees, so she applied according to law. The court then examined the woman's clothing and ornaments and found that her clothes and shoes were gorgeous, with no sign of poverty. It was estimated that she had the ability to pay the litigation fee of 799 yuan and 5 jiao in legal tender. Her request for temporary exemption should not be granted. Therefore, she was ordered to comply and pay within a time limit of seven days and await the summons of the defendants to the court for interrogation.

### Commander of French Troops in Shanghai, Pu Lati, Promoted to Colonel

The North China Daily News reported that, according to information obtained in Shanghai yesterday (30th), Lieutenant Colonel Pu Lati, commander of the French troops in Shanghai, has been promoted to the rank of colonel. Several other French officers stationed in Shanghai have also been promoted. Pu first came to Shanghai in April 1936 and was soon appointed commander of the French troops stationed in Shanghai. He will be relieved of his duties and return to his country at the end of March 1939. During the Shanghai war last year, Pu personally supervised the implementation of various military plans to protect the French Concession, which was praised by all parties.

### Hongkou Concentration Camp to Accommodate Jewish Refugees

The Shanghai Times reports: Yesterday (the 30th), local news indicated that the Shanghai Committee for Assistance to European Jewish Refugees and its local affiliated associations are preparing to accommodate over 1,500 Jewish immigrants within the Hongkou concentration camp. The camp is planned to be established in the school building rented by the Public Works Department at 138 Ward Road and will be slightly modified. The conversion is expected to be completed in about a month. According to several responsible persons of the committee, the school can accommodate 2,000 refugees, but the number of refugees will not exceed 1,500 for the time being. This morning (the 31st), about 330 refugees arrived in Shanghai by ship. The committee was engaged in the final arrangements for receiving these refugees yesterday. However, the relief committee personnel are unaware of how many Jewish refugees will arrive in Shanghai in the coming weeks. It was stated yesterday that a German newspaper for the Jewish refugees already in Shanghai has been published, but few of them speak English, which greatly hinders their job seeking and self-establishment of shops. The Public Works Department has also considered the Jewish refugee problem and believes that the number of immigrants to Shanghai should be limited. It was learned yesterday that the Public Works Department has sent a letter to the consuls of the consular body regarding the limitation of the number of immigrants and will take restrictive actions soon.

The English-language North China Daily Mail reports: The "Bredenstein" arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 31st), carrying about 70 refugees from Central Europe, with considerable luggage and neatly dressed. The "Conte Rosso" also brought 250 refugees. The number of German Jews in Shanghai will reach 1,400 in the New Year. It is heard that many people have booked tickets to Shanghai. All tickets have been pre-booked by Jews leaving Germany and Austria months in advance. It is said that it is expected that about 5,000 Jews will pack up and come to Shanghai when the persecution of Jews in Europe ends.

### Accusation for Failing to Support Concubine

The late Shan Hongqing, former president of the Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, took a Shaoxing woman, Ms. Shen, as his concubine during his lifetime. After the fall of Hangzhou, Shan Zuoquan took his family to Shanghai for refuge and lived on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. He neglected his father's concubine, Ms. Shan Shen, and did not provide for her living expenses. Ms. Shan Shen, through lawyers Xu Jianjie and Ling Xiancai, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Shan Zuoquan of abandonment and requesting legal investigation. The court, based on the complaint, repeatedly summoned the defendant by Judge Miao Qingbang. The defendant never appeared, only his defense lawyer Chen Ying appeared to argue that the plaintiff was a former maid who falsely claimed to be the defendant's father's concubine. The court stated that the defendant must appear in court in person for the case to be clarified and instructed to postpone the date and summon the defendant for further interrogation. However, since the case was filed, it has been more than two months, and the court has repeatedly opened hearings, but the defendant has never appeared. The day before yesterday, another hearing was held, but the defendant still did not appear. According to his defense lawyer, the defendant is currently ill in Hangzhou and unable to come to Shanghai, presenting a prescription and letter as evidence. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendant had repeatedly refused to appear and requested that the trial be suspended and the defendant be wanted to appear in court for further trial. The court, after reviewing the arguments, instructed both lawyers to report to the court after the defendant recovers and set another date for summons. If the defendant still does not appear after recovery, permission is granted to detain him for interrogation.

### Brothel Owner Buys Young Girl, Appeals Against Verdict

Zang Wangshi, a 56-year-old old woman from Suzhou, used to be a brothel owner in the Eight Great Alleys in Beiping. She came to Shanghai in October last year to find and buy girls to become prostitutes. Zhao Yangshi, a 49-year-old Cantonese woman living at 207 Muir Road, due to poverty, sold her 15-year-old daughter, Miaozhen, for 310 yuan to a pleasure house. Because she was not fully developed and unable to receive guests, the girl was resold to Zang Wangshi, with Chen Afeng and Yuan Chunsheng as intermediaries, for a total of 630 yuan. On October 18, Zang Wangshi, along with her nephew's wife Zhang Aqiao and nephew's daughter Wang Shuzhen, took the girl Miaozhen on the Taikoo Company's Henan ship to Tianjin and then to Beiping. When the ship was setting sail, investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongtang from the China Women and Children Relief Association boarded the ship and found them in the steerage cabin. They reported to the water patrol police, who dispatched detective Wang Songshan to arrest Zang Wangshi, Zhang Aqiao, and Wang Shuzhen. The girl was transferred to the French police station, and the two intermediary women Chen and Yuan were also arrested and sent to the Special No. 2 Court for investigation. After investigation, Zang Wangshi, Chen Afeng, and Yuan Chunsheng were prosecuted under Article 298 of the Criminal Law for obstructing freedom, while Zhang Aqiao and Wang Shuzhen were not prosecuted and were released. The initial trial sentenced Zang Wangshi to two years in prison, and Chen and Yuan to one year each. The girl was returned to her mother. Because Zang Wangshi disagreed with the verdict, she hired lawyers Wang Heng and Gu to appeal to the High Third Branch Court. The Criminal Division Chief Wu Tingqi, along with judges Gu and He, and a prosecutor, opened a collegial panel for trial the day before yesterday. According to Zang Wangshi's appeal, her daughter died last year and Miaozhen was adopted as her daughter through an introduction. She planned to take her to Beiping to learn to dance and rely on her in the future. Now she has been sentenced to two years in prison, and there is still an old mother at home, with no one to support and serve. She requested a reduction in sentence. After the court interrogated the appellant and the intermediary women Chen and Yuan, it was decided that there were problems with the case and the date was changed to summon the victim for further interrogation. The appellants were still remanded in custody.

According to shipping industry news, a Xiushan transport fishing boat, operating between Shanghai and Ningbo, with a crew of twelve, set sail from Shanghai with a large batch of ramie and other goods worth over ten thousand yuan the day before yesterday, heading to Ningbo. When passing through the sea area of Daji, it was suddenly intercepted by a pirate ship. Although the boat was equipped with self-defense firearms, it was outnumbered and eventually captured to Xiaoshan in the Xugong sea area. The goods carried on the ship were unloaded ashore, and two of the crew members were taken away. The remaining ten have all escaped and returned to report to the authorities, requesting a strict investigation.

### A Year of Enterprise

— Song Xian

Since the full-scale war of resistance against Japan, China's publishing industry has suffered extremely serious blows. As far as the largest publishing companies are concerned, such as Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, and Kaiming Bookstore, the losses suffered due to the war are alarming. For example, Kaiming's general factory in Hongkou was completely destroyed by artillery fire; the World Book Company's general factory is still occupied. Although the losses of the Commercial Press and China Book Company's general companies are not so great, more than three-fifths of their branches in various places have become victims of the god of war due to the fall of many cities. The direct losses, such as goods and buildings, when added up, are certainly considerable; the indirect losses are even more significant. Everyone knows that book industry colleagues have always granted a lot of credit, and there would not be much discrepancy in normal times due to the connection between old and new debts. However, after this decisive war, all the selling bookstores were also destroyed, and there is almost no hope of recovering these debts. When these losses are added together, we may as well say that all the capital of these publishing companies has probably been completely eroded by this decisive war!

The general cultural circles have expressed much dissatisfaction with the silence of major publishers since the outbreak of the war, and even believe that they have failed to fully recognize the future of the war of resistance and lack courage and confidence in their work. However, if they can understand their alarming losses, they probably would not have such overly severe reproaches.

From the perspective of the direct center of the war of resistance, major publishers seem to be lacking in enthusiasm: however, in reality, the intensity of their work has not only not decreased compared to before the war, but is even greater than before the war. We know that the destruction of education since the war of resistance has been great, but the government has always strived to maintain it and prevent it from stopping. Schools in various war zones have moved to safer inland areas to continue classes. The textbooks used by the schools are still able to be supplied to this day, which must be said to be due to their efforts.

A week before August 13th, the Ministry of Education gathered major publishers in Shanghai for a meeting in Nanjing. At the meeting, they were notified that the war was about to break out and that they should quickly transport machinery and goods to the inland areas. However, the situation was already very tense at this time, and various means of transportation were in short supply, making it impossible to move in reality. After the outbreak of the war, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to Shanghai to persuade the publishing agencies to move to Wuhan with the factory relocation committee. At that time, Commercial Press, China Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, and Life Bookstore all moved along. As a result, some arrived safely, some were bombed and sunk on the way, and some were robbed and their whereabouts are unknown. Statistically speaking, there were still more losses. When the war zone expanded and a large number of textbooks printed in various places were destroyed, they had no choice but to step up production in Shanghai and Hong Kong. On the one hand, the books that were produced could not be transported to the areas that needed them due to transportation difficulties, so they had to do their best in many ways. From these aspects, the difficulties of these publishers cannot but be given considerable sympathy.

In addition to the few major publishing companies, other publishers have also been making various efforts in various ways. For example, Life Bookstore and Shanghai Magazine Company have been working hard to publish small pamphlets and periodicals on the war of resistance in Sichuan, Han, and Guangdong. The newly emerging publishers after the war, such as Fuxing Press in Shanghai, Zhulin Bookstore, Fengyu Bookstore, and Dalu Bookstore in Hankou, have also done a lot of work. Most of the major books published in this year, such as "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," "Selected Works of Lenin," and "Capital," were completed by these publishers who did not have very strong capital, which cannot but be said to be an unprecedented harvest.

As far as periodicals are concerned, since the outbreak of the war, most of the magazines of major publishers have been suspended, and this point has also been criticized by various parties. This seems to be a strange phenomenon compared to the new periodicals that have sprung up everywhere. If the publication of periodicals is a profitable business, why are the companies that have stopped publication willing to sit back and watch the loss of profits? If it is a losing business, why are there so many new periodicals? According to what we know, the basic subscribers of these suspended magazines often number two or three thousand for the more popular ones, and generally no less than four or five thousand for the less popular ones. From a business standpoint, they are of course much more profitable than new publications without a foundation. However, the reason why they cannot but stop publication lies in this point. For the sake of the large number of subscribers and the broad business area, the circulation of their publications cannot be limited to one place. On the one hand, due to the lack of printing facilities in the inland areas, they cannot be printed in various places; on the other hand, due to the obstruction of transportation and the difficulty of mail delivery, magazines published in area A cannot easily reach readers in area B and are inevitably subject to criticism from readers. This is really the main reason for their suspension of publication.

These many words seem to be defending the few major publishing companies. We acknowledge that their current state of silence should be criticized. However, their losses suffered in the war and their efforts for the country and the nation seem to need to be understood by the general public.

Perhaps some people will say, according to this situation, will China's publishing industry not be completely destroyed? This is not the case. According to our observation, it will not only not be destroyed, but will instead gain a new path for rebirth. In the past, the business vision of various publishers was mostly focused on areas with relatively developed culture such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Fujian, and Guangdong, while neglecting the remote inland areas. This state of abnormal development is really unreasonable. Due to this decisive war, the cultural center has moved inland, and the publishing industry has also followed suit and developed in remote areas that have never been paid attention to before. Therefore, after the end of the war, the business development of the publishing industry will definitely increase several times compared to before, and the culture in various places will develop from abnormal to reasonable, which is really very optimistic.

Wu Mu's Inscription

The spirit of vowing to die for the country and resist the enemy leaps out of the paper. It is not only the strength of the brushstroke that is admirable. If there were no traitors at that time, the Jin people would certainly not have achieved their goals in the Central Plains. (Bai Yue)

### Shanghai's Libraries

— Bosheng

Our countrymen have always been fond of collecting books, but they are usually accumulated by individuals and not made available to the public. The library system originated in Western Europe, and due to Shanghai's status as a treaty port, the library system arrived with Europeans. When Jesuit missionaries settled in Xujiawan in the twenty-seventh year of the Daoguang reign (1847), they began collecting books for reference, and ninety years later, it has become the famous Xuhui Library. The library houses over 1,610 local chronicles from various provinces of our country; well-known newspapers such as Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and The Eastern Miscellany are also preserved in their entirety; and there are 80,000 Western books. In the twenty-ninth year of the Daoguang reign (1849), Westerners in the British Concession organized a book club, which expanded into the "Shanghai Library" by the first year of the Xianfeng reign (1851). In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), the honorary secretary of the library, Sausmares, and the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Gray, after some discussions, decided to donate all the books of the Shanghai Library to the Municipal Council, which became the present-day Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library. The library was initially commonly known as the Foreign Language Academy. On February 8th of the third year of the Guangxu reign (1877), Shen Bao reported on the library, saying: "Westerners in this port have established a Foreign Language Academy, which contains ten thousand volumes of books. Every year, five or six hundred new books are added. Readers only need to pay ten taels of silver annually to borrow and read them at any time, and return them after reading. This is truly an excellent method."

It not only introduced the library but also greatly encouraged the library system. Today, the library's collection, both Chinese and Western, totals more than 23,000 volumes; the number of visitors and books borrowed over the years can be found in the Municipal Council's reports.

In the tenth year of the Tongzhi reign (1871), the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society completed its meeting hall, and a part of it was designated as a library, specializing in Eastern books. By the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931), it had 15,000 Western books and 1,000 Chinese books.

It is described as the earliest library in Shanghai and still exists today. As for the enthusiasm of our countrymen for the library cause, it began after the founding of the Republic of China. In the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), the Ministry of Education promulgated eleven articles of the Regulations for Popular Libraries, which attracted much attention. In the same year, schools established the Nanyang Middle School Library and the Soochow University Law School Library, while commercial institutions established the Chung Hwa Book Company Library. In the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), the Jiaotong University Library and the Songpo Library were established. In the eighth year (1919), the Young Men's Christian Association Library was established. In the ninth year (1920), the YMCA Library was established. The library cause was gradually developing.

The thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924) was the year the Shanghai Library Association was organized. In the years surrounding the association's organization, the library cause seemed like a rising sun in the east, showing a vigorous image. Here are a few examples as evidence: (1) The rise of public libraries. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce established a commercial library, open to the public. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926), the Oriental Library of the Commercial Press was opened. (2) The establishment of institutional libraries. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), the First District Party Department Library was established, and in the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931), the Customs Library was established. (3) The popularity of school libraries. In the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), the Datong University Library was established; in the eleventh year (1922), the Fudan University Library; in the twelfth year (1923), the Qingxin and Minli Middle School Libraries; in the thirteenth year (1924), the Chih Chih University Library; in the fifteenth year (1926), the Guanghua and Daxia University Libraries; in the sixteenth year (1927), the Jinan University Library; and in the seventeenth year (1928), the Aurora University Library were established. The above are only the libraries of famous schools. Since the library cause was popular, many primary and secondary schools also established libraries, but upon examination, some were merely reading rooms.

During the development of the library cause, a very unfortunate event occurred: the January 28th Incident in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1932), when the Oriental Library was completely reduced to ashes. The predecessor of the Oriental Library was Hanfenlou. Hanfenlou was established by the Commercial Press for the reference of its editors. It began in the thirtieth year of the Guangxu reign (1904) when the Commercial Press was established. Zhang Yuanji was in charge, and after twenty years of Zhang's collection, the library reached hundreds of thousands of volumes. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), the Commercial Press built a large building opposite its factory, named it the Oriental Library, and opened its collection of 340,000 books to the public, making it the first library in Shanghai. Even in terms of local chronicles, it had 2,641 types from as many as 22 provinces, ranking third in the number of local chronicles among all libraries in China. Who knew that when the Japanese invaders attacked, countless precious books in the library would be burned? The library reopened on August 1st of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1932), and on April 5th of the twenty-second year (1933), the library's board of directors decided to prepare for the restoration of the Oriental Library.

## Page 14

Unfortunately, the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly occurred, and the Sino-Japanese War has not yet ended. The Oriental Library has not been able to recover soon.

Although the Ministry of Education had promulgated regulations in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915) requiring all provinces, counties, and districts to establish popular libraries, the Shanghai Municipal Library was not established until the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), nominally as the Municipal Circulating Library, on a very small scale. The following spring, the municipal government allocated 25,000 yuan and ordered the Municipal Bureau of Education to establish the Municipal Library in the Confucius Temple. In December of that year, the library building was completed, and it opened in January of the twenty-second year (1933). In the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), Mayor Wu Tiecheng initiated the construction of a large municipal library in the city center and established a preparatory committee to actively pursue it. By mid-July of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China (1935), the library building was completed. It was located in the administrative district of the city center, between Youlu Road in front of the government and Youlu Road in the south of the government, south of Xilu Road to the west of the government, facing east. The layout was in the shape of the Chinese character "工", with horizontal extensions at both ends of the front part, protruding forward and backward to form wing rooms. The maximum distance between the north and south ends was 66 meters, with a building area of 1,620 square meters, a total floor area of 3,470 square meters, and a volume of 16,000 cubic meters. The exterior of the library building adopted a hybrid style of modern and Chinese architecture. The interior layout was very elaborate. The stacks were all equipped with new steel bookshelves. The total length of the book arrangement was 15,000 meters, which could accommodate 400,000 volumes. On May 1st of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China (1936), the library was officially established. On June 1st, Mayor Wu invited book collectors, educators, journalists, and people from all walks of life who had assisted the library during the preparatory period to visit the library and hold a tea party. The children's reading room opened on June 8th, and the entire library opened on September 1st. This library could have been the largest and most promising municipal library in Shanghai, but who knew that the August 13th Incident would suddenly occur, and it would fall into the hands of the enemy and become a den of foxes and ghosts.

Since the Japanese warlords launched their war of aggression against China, Shanghai's cultural undertakings have plummeted. Universities either moved inland or to the concessions, confined to residential buildings with no library facilities. Students often suffered from a lack of books for reference. Ding Fubao of Wuxi specially opened his collection of books at the Medical Book Bureau on Baker Road, greatly benefiting scholars. However, Ding's books were mostly works on Sinology, and modern science and Western books and newspapers were not well-stocked. The Hongying Library had been working on clippings for a long time, but it was still in the preparatory stage and had not been opened to the public. Currently, the following are available for scholars to consult and use:

Customs Library

Municipal Council Public Library

Aurora Library

Xujiahui Library

Royal Asiatic Society Library

French Association Library

China International Library

Young Men's Christian Association Library

YMCA Library

United Library of Christian Universities

Mingfu Library

Ding's Library

China Circulation Library

Dingxiang Library

For the above libraries, an introduction is required to enter the Xuhui Library. The Customs Library has many books on economics and commerce in English. The Mingfu Library, located in the China Science Society, has more than 200 kinds of scientific journals, totaling more than 30,000 volumes, which are the most precious. Those who study science can go to this library. The China International Library was reorganized from the original library of the World Society and is still located at the original site of the World Society on Furguson Road. Its collection focuses on international relations. The Aurora Library has many French books, while the Young Men's Christian Association Library and the YMCA Library have many Christian books. Readers can make use of the various libraries according to their nature as described in this article.

### Shanghai's Museums

— Zhiyuan

The events and objects recorded in books are numerous, but without physical objects to prove them, the traces of human activity become mere words on paper. Therefore, the museum system exists to supplement the deficiencies of books. The establishment of museums in Shanghai should be attributed to Father Heude, a French Catholic priest, who founded the Xujiahui Museum at the end of the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign (1867). It was decided by the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society to establish the Shanghai Museum in the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign (1874). The Shanghai Municipal Government, recognizing the importance of museums, moved in the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933) to build a museum in the city center, which officially opened in the twenty-sixth year (1937), giving Shanghai its first municipal museum established by Chinese. The following is a description of the three major museums in Shanghai and their development.

(1) Heude Museum (Aurora Museum)

Father Heude was a biologist who arrived in Shanghai in December of the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign (1867). Seeing that the Xujiahui Cathedral had a small collection of biological specimens, he decided to expand it and establish a museum. Father Heude soon went to the interior of China to investigate, paying close attention to the Yangtze River basin. Each time he returned to Shanghai, he brought back a large number of strange specimens. To collect Père David's Deer, he went to various parts of the Northwest, and his achievements were enormous. His book "The Père David's Deer" has become one of the world's famous works on biology. In the ninth year of the Guangxu reign (1883), he began to build a museum south of the Xujiahui Jesuit General Hospital to store specimens. It was open to the public every afternoon without charge. At that time, the lower floor stored mammals and fish and bird skeletons, and the upper floor stored beetles, shells, mammal taxidermy, birds, and reptiles. Father Heude presided over this museum for thirty years. Afterwards, it was headed by Father Conrtois, then Father Savio, and now by Father Piel, although Father Savio is still in the museum as a researcher.

As time went by, more and more specimens were collected, and the old building was no longer sufficient. Therefore, in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), construction of a large-scale museum building began on the site of Aurora University. The museum has three floors, each 80 meters long, divided into three exhibition rooms, as well as research rooms, laboratories, libraries, photography rooms, etc. To the south of the museum, a botanical garden was opened to cultivate flowers and trees for research. It opened in the winter of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), with visiting hours set at 2:00 to 5:00 pm on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, with a ticket price of two jiao. Currently, the first and second exhibition rooms are open to the public. The first exhibition room displays Chinese antiques. These antiques were collected by Brother Ge of the Tushanwan Orphanage. The antiques are divided into metal, jade, pottery, and embroidery. At the northern end of the room is a display of the remains of Xie Jiazhen of Chongming, which is most eye-catching. Xie Jiazhen was a Juren (successful candidate in the imperial examination) during the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty and died in the Kangxi reign. In the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), his descendants dug up his tomb. The body was not decayed, and the clothes and bedding were as new, as was his wife, Madam Lin. The coffin was obtained by Brother Ge, who made a wooden statue of Xie Jiazhen, dressed it in the original burial clothes, and placed the objects from the coffin beside it. The embroidery on display is a type of Gu Embroidery, a famous product of Shanghai, known as Kong Embroidery. The second exhibition room contains biology specimens, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and mollusks. Bird specimens are beautifully arranged and lifelike, and insect specimens are also very elaborate, as the museum is currently focusing on entomology. Plant specimens have a dedicated room, with a total of 50,000 specimens. In addition, the various books published by the museum are very comprehensive and highly admired by specialized scholars around the world.

(2) Shanghai Museum

The Shanghai Museum is located on the fourth and fifth floors of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at No. 20 Museum Road in the Public Concession. The museum was founded in the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign (1874) and has been around for more than sixty years. The honorary curators have mostly been naturalists and biologists, and the current honorary curator, Sowerby, is a giant in the field. Therefore, the museum's exhibits are mostly biological specimens, although there are also many works of art and antiques. The sources and regions of the items are mostly from China, as the museum is aimed at studying China. The first honorary curator of the museum was W. B. Pryre. Shen Bao reported on the museum on October 7th of the first year of the Guangxu reign (1875):

"In major cities of the West, it is customary for the people of the area to build a museum to display birds, beasts, and various animals for naturalists to enjoy at any time. In a prefecture city, the museum will be filled with the products of the entire prefecture; in the capital city, the museum will be filled with the products of the entire country, and it is called a museum. Now, Western merchants living in Shanghai are imitating the Western model and establishing a museum in this port, gathering various objects from China and the East. Although the enterprise is just beginning, the items on display are already numerous. Among the furry creatures, there are wild boars from the side of Lake Tai; among the birds, there are hawks, magpies, sparrows, etc.; there are also aquatic creatures, which cannot be fully described. Other insects such as mantises, grasshoppers, and butterflies are also classified and labeled. Each item is labeled with where it came from and who donated it. Visitors, both Chinese and foreign, are not charged. Western countries have wonderful methods for preserving feathers of all kinds, so that even when the skin is dry, the feathers will not fall out. Now, the Chinese have obtained this method; and they have also purchased glass eyes from abroad, so that no matter what strange beast or rare bird it is, once decorated, it will be lifelike and full of vitality. All the items in the museum are provided by Western naturalists. The person in charge of this is Mr. Pryre of Yuanfang Trading Company."

Museum Road was originally named Yuanmingyuan Road. The municipal authorities of the concession changed the name out of respect for the museum. Since the third year of the Guangxu reign (1877), the Municipal Council has been donating funds to support the museum annually.

(3) Shanghai Municipal Museum

The proposal for the Shanghai Municipal Museum was made in the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933). The funds came from municipal public bonds, with the construction cost of the museum set at 300,000 yuan. The architectural appearance was similar to that of the Municipal Library, located opposite the library. The two museums faced each other from afar, forming the left and right wings of the municipal government. In the spring of the twenty-fourth year (1935), the preparatory committee of the museum appointed a temporary board of directors to manage it. The chairman of the board was Mr. Ye Gongchuo. Mr. Ye was a lover of art and was good at managing

(Continued on page 15)

affairs, so he was able to manage the museum with ease. The board of directors decided that the nature of the museum would be primarily art and history, with history focusing on Shanghai.

The construction of the museum building was completed on the Double Tenth Festival of the twenty-fourth year (1935). The internal layout was roughly as follows: (1) Ground floor: The central entrance is the lobby, about 17.5 meters wide and 14 meters long, with stairs to the upper floors and rooms for coats, hats, and souvenirs. From here, one enters the main hall, 11.5 meters wide and 18 meters long. The hall displays the four large stone carvings of the local worthy Lu Shen, and the walls are hung with twelve Gu Embroidery tapestries, a specialty of Shanghai. There are also two clocks that indicate the time in Shanghai and the corresponding time in various countries around the world. Inside the main hall is the first exhibition room. The two sides of the hall are corridors. Both corridors display various documents from Shanghai. The corridors connect to the offices in the left and right wings of the front part. The protruding part of the left wing is the library; the protruding part of the right wing is the lecture hall. (2) Second floor: The central part is divided into two sections. The front section is the art section, with a large puppet show stage. The rear section is the history section, displaying clothing, utensils, music, embroidery, and models of hairstyles from various dynasties, which are particularly eye-catching. The two corridors also display historical exhibits. The two wings have the best lighting and display paintings, calligraphy, porcelain, bronzes, and pottery, which are the focus of the art section. (3) Above the front exhibition hall on the central second floor is a mezzanine, with the ground level with the flat roof of the rear half. From here, one can reach the gatehouse on the fourth floor via an open-air staircase. The gatehouse also has a platform around it for distant views. There is a basement under the main hall for boilers and other equipment. In April of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China (1936), the museum opened with an exhibition of Chinese architecture, and visitors were crowded and full of praise. In January of the twenty-sixth year (1937), the museum officially opened to the public, and thousands of Chinese and foreign visitors came to visit every day, with traffic in the city center constantly congested. July 7th was Shanghai City Memorial Race Day, and the municipal government's affiliated agencies jointly held various exhibitions to celebrate. The museum held the Shanghai Literature Exhibition, with extremely fine and systematic exhibits, which were praised by all sectors. Unexpectedly, it

### Shanghai's Music Scene in the Past Year

— Zhongyue

Following the sound of cannons on "August 13th," many Shanghai artists left Shanghai. Due to the environment, Shanghai's musical activities in 1938 were quite lonely in all respects.

Let us take a bird's-eye view of the Chinese schools, movies, halls, and publishing industries.

In the academy, the National Conservatory of Music was shut down due to environmental reasons and was replaced by a private conservatory. The faculty remained the same, but the best professor, Mr. Huang Zi, unfortunately passed away, and many excellent young people went to serve on the front lines. The conservatory then re-enrolled a large number of new students; the new students' musical level was naturally lower, and the conservatory's professors had to work doubly hard. Under the leadership of Mr. Xiao Youmei, the entire faculty and students were able to cooperate and try their best to ensure that the vacant rear could quickly obtain new recruits for the musical scene.

Smaller music schools included Chen Youxin's Shandeshanghai Conservatory of Music, and Zhang Yanbao, Li Dong, Huang Yijun, and Huang Tinggui's Guangming Conservatory of Music, both of which held concerts. Private music educators included Xia Guoqiong (piano), Chen Zhong and Pan Boyan (violin), Chen Gexin and Si Yigui (vocal music), Ye Huaide (flute), Zhang Zhenfu (cello), and Zhang Hao, Qiu Menghen, and Qu Lizhong (various fields).

Many people wrote insert songs for movies, but most were "amateur" composers. Yan Gongshang consistently used his Kunqu opera style; "The Mermaid Princess" was relatively easy to sing. Wu Cun wrote a song called "The Four Seasons Bloom," which was very popular in dance halls and had a folk song flavor. Although the music that Chen Minggao wrote for "Woman" had some quirks, it was ultimately a more pure work, although the performers were not always up to par. Chen Gexin's "Scandal" and "Spring Breeze and Wild Grass" were two excellent love songs, but of course, they would lose their meaning due to the times when they were removed from the play. After breaking away from his old life, Li Jinhui went to Chongqing to devote himself to his new life, while Shanghai retained his younger brother Li Jingguang to continue his older brother's old path in film music composition.

Very few concerts were held. We can remember the combined concerts of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and the Guangming Conservatory of Music, and Tan Xiaolin's memorial concert for Mr. Huang Zi. The Experimental Orchestra played many works by Chinese composers, and only Tan Xiaolin's Fantasy can be remembered for its technical achievement. The Guangming, Zhonghua, Lianhe, and Shanghai Harmonica Societies all held concerts, with programs that were mostly so-called "popular songs" or "pure art" pieces. Except for the Zhonghua and Shanghai societies, which played Chen Gexin's "Spring" (also known as "Survive This Cold Winter"), and the Zhonghua society, which played more marches, the others had too few marches. However, since the proceeds from the performances went to refugee relief, we can say that they fulfilled a part of their responsibility.

The 250-person chorus "The Holy City" under the direction of Zhao Meibo is also worth mentioning. Although there were unsatisfactory aspects, Zhao and his many sacred music colleagues' attempt to plead for refugees should not be erased.

There were also few publications. Anti-Japanese war songs were only reprinted, while publications such as electric music songs were available. Xu Chi published three issues of "Pure Literature," which included Chen Gexin's "Worries" and "Water Wheel." "Self-Study" had many relatively progressive songs. The Conservatory of Music published three issues of "Music Monthly," which included songs composed by Professor Li Weining and some musical essays. Music World also introduced some art and poetry, and only "Lullaby in the Wind and Rain" had a sense of the times.

Although, due to the gradual clarity of the artists' understanding, various performers, composers, and organizations are uniting, and there is more active work to be done. Various singing groups and harmonica societies will, under the same mission as the artists, set aside their opinions and cooperate. Publishers will release a large number of new poems and songs that are relevant to the times. The music weekly that was once rumored in the Huamei Morning Post will also be published. Many experts have agreed to abandon their academic works and write for the masses in this great era. Musicians are striving for their position and due work in drama, film, and schools. Let us wish in advance the "opening of spring flowers" for the art of this "isolated island"!

St. John's University

### Brief History of the Department of Journalism

— Tao Qixiang

The first to establish vocational education in journalism nationwide was St. John's University in Shanghai. In 1921 (Year 10 of the Republic of China), the President of the university, Dr. F. L. Hawks Pott, invited Mr. Don Patterson, the business manager of the Shanghai Weekly Review (later known as the China Weekly Review of Millard's Review), to serve as a journalism lecturer at the university, teaching journalism interviewing and writing. This marked the earliest journalism course in China. For practical experience, the university founded a small English weekly newspaper covering news related to St. John's, named The St. John's Dial, also known as

In the following year (Year 11 of the Republic of China), Mr. Maurlee E. Yotaw came to China from the United States and joined St. John's University as a formal journalism teacher. Both Don Patterson and Maurlee E. Yotaw were graduates of the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri in the United States, which was the first of its kind in the world.

From a very humble beginning to the present day, the interest of Chinese youth in journalism has steadily increased over these eighteen years. Many St. John's graduates who studied journalism are now serving in newspapers and news agencies throughout the country, and their achievements are highly praised by all sectors of society. For example, the New Year special issue of the Shen Bao will include articles collected and written by current journalism students at the school. These students will be the pioneers of the Chinese journalism field in the future.

The journalism department at St. John's University is currently the only one in East China. Although other universities, such as Shanghai University and Fudan University, have also established journalism departments, they were unable to maintain continuous operations. Currently, Shanghai University only has a few journalism courses within its business school. Since the establishment of the Associated Christian Colleges of East China last year, in addition to the junior and senior students of St. John's being able to select journalism courses, students from Shanghai University, Soochow University, and Hangzhou University can also enroll.

The St. John's University journalism department offers several specialized courses each year, with Mr. Maurlee E. Yotaw in charge of the entire department. The courses include "Journalism Interviewing and Writing," "News Editing," "Brief History of World Journalism," "Advertising," "Advertising Design," and "Salesmanship," among others. The number of students in each class ranges from a dozen to several dozen. The St. John's Dial serves as a practical tool for the department's students.

Although the current campus of The St. John's Dial is located in the Cishu Building, and the students are all commuting students, resulting in a significant reduction in news about the school, the publication continues. The content still consists of articles of interest to students, faculty, and alumni of the school. The current editor of the weekly newspaper is Mr. Tao Qixiang. The weekly newspaper is financially independent, with expenses covered by student publication fees and hundreds of copies ordered each issue by the St. John's University Alumni Association. Therefore, although the newspaper does not have advertising revenue, it can still balance its income and expenses. It is published every Wednesday.

The authorities at St. John's University hope to establish a journalism college in the near future, specifically training young people aspiring to serve in the newspaper industry, teaching them the best European, American, and Chinese knowledge and skills related to journalism, to expand the scope of this long-standing department's work, and to cultivate outstanding talent for the Chinese news and publishing industry, Chinese and English newspapers, news agencies, etc. Raising the standards of the Chinese journalism industry is also the college's goal, in the hope that in the future, people in the Chinese journalism industry can compete internationally with leaders from all fields, jointly seeking China's international status and national revival. The suggestion to establish a journalism college, in addition to the strong cooperation of the authorities of East China universities, would greatly benefit if it could receive the support and promotion of advanced figures in the Chinese and Western press in Shanghai. Its success can be predicted, and its effectiveness can be maximized. Shanghai is the axis of China's news and publishing industry, and from the perspective of journalism, it will continue to be one of the most important places for Chinese cultural undertakings. Therefore, if a journalism college can obtain the assistance of the press, its future will be limitless.

The Department of Journalism at Yenching University in Beiping is the largest in the country and has long enjoyed a reputation at home and abroad. Its initial establishment was also on a small scale, but it later relied on the support of the press in North China and other regions, enthusiastically seeking reforms in its affairs. The fundraising by a committee composed entirely of people from the press, has led to excellent results today. If the suggestion for a journalism college at St. John's can be assisted by advanced figures in the Shanghai press, then its establishment should not be a problem.

### General Situation of the Shanghai Publishing Industry

Kaiming Bookstore

I. Past History

1.  The Process of Establishment

The founder of Kaiming Bookstore was Mr. Zhang Xichen. Since 1926, he had been publishing the New Woman magazine from his home in Baoshan Lane, Baoshan Road, and subsequently published many new books. In order to eliminate the bad habits of the publishing industry at the time, he strictly selected the content of publications, paid attention to the beauty of the format, and strived for low prices. Therefore, he gained the trust of many readers. When the publishing organization in the home was no longer able to meet the needs of society, Mr. Zhang joined forces with Mr. Xia Gaizun, Mr. Feng Zikai, and other famous figures in the cultural world to form a bookstore.

2.  Expansion of Business and Publishing Trends

Since its establishment, Kaiming has strived to improve the publishing business and has gained the trust of a large readership. By 1930, the privately organized bookstore was no longer able to meet the needs of society, so it began to expand and was reorganized into a limited liability company. Branch stores were also established in various places, including Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, Changsha, Beiping, and Shenyang. The main factory also underwent several relocations due to the expansion of business, and later settled in Wuzhou Road. The capital was gradually increased from several hundred yuan to 300,000 yuan.

In terms of publishing trends, the initial target audience was middle school students, and the "Middle School Student" magazine best represents this trend.

Later, their business expanded, and the target audience for publishing also expanded from middle school students to elementary school students. The newly compiled elementary school textbooks had an original spirit, and the "New Youth" magazine, which was published next, was an intermediate reading material between elementary school and middle school. At the same time, the scope of publishing was expanded to all aspects, and specialized works of the same nature as the university series were also published one after another. Valuable ancient books were also printed one after another. For example, the reduced-size printing of the "Twenty-Five Histories," the compilation of the "Supplements to the Twenty-Five Histories," and the collection of "Famous Ci Poets of the Qing Dynasty" were praised by the academic community. At that time, due to the complexity of personnel affairs and the urgency of world changes, newspapers and magazines presented a phenomenon of clouds steaming and rosy clouds. Therefore, people in society felt the regret of not being able to browse them all. Therefore, they published the "Monthly Magazine." In addition to establishing various categories to accommodate important materials from all aspects, there were also special articles to analyze and discuss various important issues. In this way, their publishing trends expanded even further.

3.  Statistics of Publications

How many books have they actually published? Let us make a statistic to see. The following table is a classification statistic from the beginning of business in August 1926 to December 31, 1938:

Category Volumes

General 16 6

Philosophy 42 46

Religion 7 7

Social Sciences 172 27

Linguistics 76 147

Natural Sciences 90 102

Applied Technology 20 20

Arts 91 112

Literature 300 393

History and Geography 103 133

Total 917 1242

(Note) Various magazines and loose-leaf selections are not included

II. Present and Future

In the summer of 1931, the National Government was determined to resist the war. The Shanghai book industry received instructions from the Ministry of Education to rush to produce enough primary and secondary school textbooks for one or two years of use in the shortest possible time and to transport them to the interior for storage immediately. Naturally, Kaiming Bookstore was no exception. They were also working on this in the factory in Hongkou. However, at that time, the sentiment of resisting the war was rising day by day, and the people of Hongkou were evacuating from the Hongkou district like a tide. However, Kaiming Bookstore was too busy with work to take care of the issue of relocation.

On the morning of August 13, the sacred all-out war of resistance began. The employees of Kaiming Bookstore, who were still working in the Hongkou factory, did not leave their workplaces to escape until they heard the sound of artillery fire. A week later, the many finished and unfinished goods, as well as machines and original manuscripts, were all destroyed by artillery fire. Later, as the war deepened, all the places where Kaiming had branches became war zones one after another. Therefore, the branches in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, and Changsha had to retreat. (Shenyang and Beiping had retreated as early as six and one years ago, respectively.) Some places did not have time to retreat and were burned down. Judging from their tangible losses alone, the numbers are already very small!

Kaiming has more than ten years of history and a considerable position in the publishing industry. If it is destroyed once, it will not be able to stand on its own. It will not only show its fragility, but also will not be able to face the country. Although they do not have big capitalists as backers, they are still struggling to overcome this difficult situation. They are still publishing new books and reprinting previously published books, and have established new branches in Chongqing, Guilin, Kunming, Guiyang, and Wanxian. A bright future must be ahead of them, and this is believable.

### The World Book Company

Undoubtedly, World Book Company, Commercial Press, and China Book Company are the three largest publishers in China, in terms of history, scale, and contribution to culture. After the start of the August 13th Incident, Commercial Press and China Book Company successively moved to Hong Kong, while only World Book Company remained in Shanghai.

## Page 16

The World Book Company's distribution center on Fuzhou Road had previously suffered a bombing tragedy. Subsequently, the main factory in Hongkou repeatedly experienced the removal of large quantities of stored books by the Japanese. The situation was reported in various Chinese and foreign newspapers, which further aroused the central government and all sectors of society's enthusiastic sympathy and concern for the World Book Company. Because this newspaper is publishing a cultural edition for the New Year supplement, we specifically visited the authorities of the World Book Company, and they answered as follows:

Why was there no plan to relocate the factory beforehand?

According to his answer, the World Book Company and other peers, such as Commercial Press and China Book Company, had submitted a plan to the central government in the spring of 1936 to relocate the factory, hoping that the central government could provide appropriate convenience. At that time, the World Book Company planned to move to Wuchang, the Commercial Press planned to move to Changsha, and the China Book Company planned to move to Nanchang. The purpose was to disperse each company in various places, so that if international warfare occurred, the publishing industry could avoid major threats. However, later, due to various problems between the central government and local governments, it was quite difficult, so there was no rapid progress. In the summer of 1937, the central government intended to have the three major companies relocate, but soon the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. It was too late and there was no time to relocate. Later, Commercial Press and China Book Company expanded their existing factories in Hong Kong, while the World Book Company believed that if there was a solution in Hong Kong, there must also be a solution in Shanghai. In other words, if there was no solution in Shanghai, there would be no solution in Hong Kong either. Therefore, it was decided not to set up another factory in Hong Kong. This point, according to their experience of more than a year, has proven that their judgment at that time was very insightful. Now they are publishing in Shanghai, which is no different from Commercial Press and China Book Company publishing in Hong Kong. Moreover, the expenses in Shanghai are said to be more economical than those in Hong Kong; the cost is lower, and the price of books can be cheaper.

How are you publishing now?

He said that after the start of the August 13th Incident, they looked for a suitable publishing place in the concession area. The current production capacity is no less than before the war. As long as there is a need, they can still supply in large quantities. They recently counted that a total of 189 kinds of new books have been published since the war, an average of one new book every three days. However, this is still the result of special restrictions due to the expansion of the war zone and business relations. All kinds of reprinted books, whether textbooks or reference books, are prepared as usual and supplied continuously. They also try their best to transport books to various provinces in the interior. Now, transportation is the most problematic, the cost is often ten times higher than before, and the time is indefinitely long, not including losses on the road. This is not just their situation, but listening to his words, it is really extremely difficult.

Why are there so many stored books in the main factory?

He said that because they did not have time to relocate the factory, they planned to store enough books for several years of use in various provinces in the interior. Unexpectedly, the incident happened suddenly, and they did not have time to transport them all out. Reports have stated that more than 6 million volumes have been transported away by the Japanese. In fact, it is more than this number. According to the actual storage of books in the main factory, there were more than 30 million volumes. It is heard that more than 10 million volumes have been successively burned by the Japanese. The open space in front of the factory is covered with ashes that are more than a foot thick. It is truly an unprecedented disaster for the Chinese cultural world. What new publishing plans do you have?

He said happily that in order to meet the needs of readers and seek their own revival, there are many new publishing plans. What can be reported here is that from this year, within the possible range, they will still often restore the large-scale publication of new books before the war. In the near future, there will be more new books that can be published; at the same time, they welcome submissions from all walks of life, or suggestions for editorial plans. They want to seek growth from the ashes.

Opinions on the publishing industry

He said that the publishing business is very difficult, especially in this period. The first point is in terms of management. Chinese publishers, due to various reasons, all adopt a three-in-one system of editorial office, printing office, and distribution office; therefore, management is very complex. For example, editors and authors are all literati, printers and binders are all warriors, and there is a group of businessmen who are neither literati nor warriors in between; therefore, it is really not easy for the general manager to deal with such a situation. To tell a joke, you really need to be "proficient in both literature and martial arts," otherwise, it is inevitable that you will lose sight of one thing while attending to another. The second point is in terms of capital. The publishing business requires extremely large capital, such as factory equipment, raw materials, semi-finished products, total office stock, goods in transit, branch office stock, accounts receivable, etc., which require six or seven batches of capital. In order to have a business location and spread throughout the country, the above items all require a very large quantity to cope with, and books are not like daily necessities such as cotton yarn and cloth, which can be mortgaged or sold at any time and place; therefore, the above items all require sufficient capital to be turned around. The third point is. Because of the underdevelopment of Chinese education, the people's annual consumption on books is very small; therefore, the publishing industry in China can be said to be still in its infancy.

Although he said all the current difficulties of the publishing industry, he still constantly expressed great optimism for the future of the publishing industry. Although the World Book Company has encountered an unprecedented disaster, it is already actively planning for revival. Such a conversation is really not only welcome to those who care about the World Book Company, but also can give great encouragement to those who are encountering the same situation.

### Guangming Bookstore

In the turbulent new publishing industry, Guangming Bookstore is the one that has been moving forward slowly like a snail for more than ten years. The establishment of Guangming was as early as the Great Revolution of 1928. It has always been at the forefront of the times and has published many new publications. Among them, reference books for various subjects in middle school, literary theory series, world literature series, social science series, biography series, single editions such as A Modern History of China, A Basic Course in Political and Economic Science, A Dictionary of Modern Language, magazine Era Forum, Literary World, have all been praised by the cultural world. After the outbreak of the August 13th all-out war of resistance, in order to promote wartime culture in the rear, the Hankou branch published a series of National Liberation series edited by Pingxin, and the Guangzhou branch planned the Free China series and Guangming Library, but they were not completed due to the fall of Guangzhou. Now, the three branches in Chongqing, Liuzhou, and Jinhua are also dedicated to promoting wartime culture. In Shanghai, they are dedicated to publishing international issues and social science theory books. It is heard that there are several books that will be published soon that are worth reporting to readers: (1) Hu Ming's translation of The Economic Geography of the Capitalist World, which is a monumental work of 500,000 words with 150 charts, which the translator completed with 18 months of painstaking effort. (2) Wang Yaosan's translation of A Course in Monetary Credit, which is a collective writing compiled by G. Katzrov, 300,000 words long. (3) Pingxin's Talks on the History of Revolutions in Various Countries, which is a nearly 200,000-word work written in one breath with the historical facts of revolutions in various countries as the backbone. These three books are not only very correct in their viewpoints, but also very novel in their writing style. They are truly rare works in the current publishing industry.

In terms of distribution, because of their longer history, their distribution network is also relatively broad. Now, many new publishing companies and private publications entrust them to distribute, and they have achieved good results, such as the pictorial published by the Far East Bookstore, Gambling in China by Japan, Resistance War and Revolution, the Seashore Relics edited by Fengyu Bookstore, the New Knowledge series of Jianshe, and the Public Opinion series of Gonglun Society, the Literature Monthly of Wenxian Society, etc. They can more faithfully provide the words "fast" and "cheap" to readers in the interior and to real estate agents in various places who entrust them to handle or subscribe to newspapers and books on their behalf. On the isolated island, it can be said that it is a diligent sower of cultural undertakings.

### Zhengzhong Bookstore

Zhengzhong Bookstore was founded by famous scholars and scholars who care about cultural undertakings in China. It was established in 1933. Its purpose is to compile and print various books, introduce domestic and foreign academic studies, promote Chinese culture, and promote Chinese science and education. It aims to instill knowledge in young people so that their thoughts gradually tend to be unified. Since its opening, a large number of books and magazines have been published. To date, the former has reached more than a thousand volumes, and the latter has more than ten kinds. They are all popular in the world and have won praise from scholars across the country. In the meantime, new materials, consistent centers, precise differences, and entire plans were compiled in accordance with the standards set by the ministry, including a set of textbooks for junior high schools, senior high schools, normal schools, and simple normal schools. Since its publication, it has been praised by educators, who believe that it is a good tool for educating young people. Last year, the publication of General Chiang Kai-shek's Half-Month Record in Xi'an sold millions of copies, and the bookstore's reputation spread overseas. The bookstore initially established its headquarters in Nanjing, and branches have been established in various provinces and cities. Last year, when the war broke out and the capital fell, the bookstore moved its headquarters to Wuhan. Although it suffered heavy losses, it still worked hard to operate in hardship and continued to publish a large number of new books to meet the needs of the extraordinary period. Now, the headquarters has been moved from Wuhan to Chongqing, as the business center for the northwest and southwest. Printing factories have been set up in Chongqing and Hong Kong, each one producing books continuously. The Hong Kong factory is larger in scale, and after submitting it to the Hong Kong government for approval, it is actively working with huge production capacity, which is enough to supply the needs of the southeastern provinces and has a surplus. This is also good news for the scholars. In addition, the bookstore has also strived to enrich the branch offices in Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, etc., in order to facilitate the circulation of books in each of these places. Branch offices or sales offices have also been set up in Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Fujian to actively supply them, hoping to fulfill their cultural responsibility during the war.

### Great Wall Bookstore

Great Wall Bookstore was established in 1930 and was founded by people from the education and financial circles in Shanghai. It has been in existence for nine years and specializes in publishing books on youth cultivation and practical reference books. The selection of manuscripts is very strict, so the books published are very popular among educators and people from all walks of life. Such as "How to Train Yourself," "How to Study," "How to Train Your Thoughts," "Self-Creation," "Life in Soviet Russia," and other books were popular for a time, and many schools adopted them as reference books and compulsory extracurricular reading materials.

### Yadong Library

— Wang Meng

Yadong Library was founded in 1913 and has a history of twenty-six years. During this period, I have no idea how many of our peers have gone from initial creation to prosperity, from prosperity to decline, and from decline to extinction; Yadong Library can still survive thousands of trials and tribulations, which is something that cannot but be gratifying.

The initial foundation of Yadong Library was laid in Wuhu, which is what is called the "Scientific Books Society". At that time, it was the 29th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, and the atmosphere of reform was very vigorous. Those who were worried about the country competed to promote science as the only magic weapon for saving the country, and the establishment of the Scientific Books Society was a concrete manifestation of this trend of thought. This important cultural town in southern Anhui, the Wuhu people commonly called the "Science Map" Yadong branch, was destroyed until Wuhu fell last year.

Yadong is not an enterprise invested by rich merchants solely for profit, but the result of the efforts of those who are interested in cultural undertakings: therefore, in terms of publishing, it has never taken profit as the first and only standard. Therefore, in the past twenty years of Chinese culture and ideology history, Yadong Library has its own considerable position. The following are a few of the more important historical facts: After Mr. Sun Yat-sen's failure to protect the law in 1919, in view of the importance of ideological propaganda, he came to Shanghai to found the Jianshe magazine. At that time, due to environmental reasons, no bookstores would distribute it on their behalf, but only my Yadong resolutely took on the task and undertook it for two years.

In the literary revolution of the May Fourth Movement, Yadong did its best. The main works of new literary masters such as Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi were all published by Yadong.

Yadong was also a strong promoter of the rise of Chinese social sciences after 1925. The creations and introductions of Mr. Li Ji, Gao Yuhan, Lin Chaozhen, etc., also had a huge impact on social sciences in our country.

For example, the famous works that agitated the entire Chinese ideological world: the debate on science and outlook on life: various punctuated novels that have epoch-making significance in the history of Chinese novels, as well as more than 200 kinds of translations on archeology, natural science, and literature (many of which have been adopted as textbooks by major and medium-sized schools in China), without exception, came from the hands of famous scholars at home and abroad, and have considerable permanent value. The past efforts of Yadong Library cannot be erased by anyone.

However, Yadong will never limit itself to the past history, nor will it be satisfied with the achievements it has already made. Now we have a consistent policy of "only suspecting of transcending the times, and never having the disadvantage of reversing history", and hope to publish a few good books on natural science, social science, and literature and philosophy in a practical and practical way.

### Zhongxi Bookstore

Zhongxi Bookstore was established in 1923, and the general distribution office is located between Sanma and Wangping Street. Over the years, it has published more than 500 kinds of books for various applications, such as books on crafts, books on martial arts, readers and reference books, various kinds of letters for various applications, books on Chinese and Western medicine, books on physiology and hygiene, translations of world famous books, and newly written various popular novels. Each category is compiled, printed, and published by experts. The business policy is to wholesale to the industry at a small profit, with the aim of popularizing culture, so bookstores of all sizes across the country and in various ports of Southeast Asia directly purchase and sell from the bookstore.

### Zhongwai Book Company

Zhongwai Book Company was founded many years ago. The original site was inside the Chinese Art and Crafts Society on Avenue Édouard VII. Its main business is to photocopy Western books for schools and to handle original Western books and magazines on behalf of others. Because of the development of business, the original site was insufficient for use. Therefore, on September 18, 1937, it moved to 376 Avenue Albert and added a retail department. In order to promote the cultural undertaking, the shareholders specially increased the capital to more than 60,000 yuan, and the shareholders' meeting decided to specially hire Mr. Sheng Jitang as the general manager. Mr. Sheng was originally the manager of Lianyin Bookstore, so he has considerable experience in photocopying Western books and is enthusiastic about education and cultural undertakings. He has published and photocopied hundreds of kinds of Western books, including physics and chemistry, medicine, machinery, and many other kinds. Among them, there are more translations of reference books. Various schools have adopted them as textbooks. Detailed catalogs are available, and written or personal requests can be obtained immediately. For the convenience of people from all walks of life and school groups, the store has specially appointed dealers in Chengdu, Kunming, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Guangxi, etc. The prices are low. The retail department consigns publications from major bookstores such as Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming, Zhengzhong, Beixin, and Niuhuo.

### Advice for German Language Students

— Wan Chang Bookstore

Learning is the foundation for contributing to society, and books are the key. In this era of flourishing science, knowledge is vast and boundless, categorized and specialized. However, the publication of German books in Shanghai is quite limited, leaving readers with a sense of regret. Recognizing this, our bookstore specializes in distributing and reprinting German books to meet the needs of readers and alleviate their burden.

Our bookstore, originally located in Wusong, sells German books on engineering, medicine, science, chemistry, literature, and other subjects. The German textbooks used at National Tongji University are all published by our bookstore. We are grateful for the high praise from all sectors of society, who have referred to us as the "Grand Repository of German Books." However, we dare not be complacent and strive for continuous improvement to serve society and repay the kindness of all.

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance War, our bookstore has suffered heavy losses. When the National Revolutionary Army retreated westward and Tongji University relocated to Jinhua, although our bookstore suffered significant losses, we maintained our original commitment to service. We urgently bound a portion of the books stored in Shanghai and moved them with Tongji University to meet the university's needs. Subsequently, we moved with the university to Jiangxi and then to Babu in He County, Guangxi. Now, our bookstore, recognizing the urgent needs of those studying German in Shanghai, has established a branch office at 9 Fudeli Lane, 7 Chengdu Road, at the intersection of Route Foch, in addition to the Babu headquarters. We also sell textbooks and reference books for major bookstores, universities, and schools of all levels. Furthermore, we have added a printing department to provide printing services for various documents, with novel designs and prompt delivery. To further develop our business, we plan to begin this year by: (1) publishing at least one new book each month to cater to enthusiasts; (2) publishing as many recommended German classics as possible, within our capabilities; (3) printing new German textbooks for schools upon request; and (4) publishing or co-publishing outstanding works or translations related to Chinese and German by authors, which are most welcome. These few words are intended to solicit your guidance. Wishing you progress.

### Preface to "Disinfection of Drinking Water with Chlorine"

— Cheng Muyuan

Alas! The function of chlorine is great indeed! It can kill people, and it can also benefit them. Its ability to kill people will not be discussed here, but its ability to benefit people can be described. We humans live on this earth, and water is one of the necessities of our daily lives. Without water, there would be no life. In the past, nomadic peoples had to live by water and grass, which shows how important water is. Given that water is so necessary for us humans, it is essential to pay close attention to the quality of the water and whether it is suitable for us. Otherwise, the harm to the public would be considerable. As evidenced by the epidemics that have occurred in Shanghai, all are closely related to water. Every time an epidemic raged, the deaths were numerous, and the terrible experiences still send shivers down our spines. However, since water plants have widely adopted chlorine disinfection, the sanitary condition of the water has greatly improved, far beyond what was possible before the use of chlorine. Therefore, although epidemics still occur, their severity has been greatly reduced, which must be attributed to chlorine. With effective prevention, the spread of bacteria in the water can be suppressed, which greatly benefits mankind. Regarding specialized books on chlorine for water disinfection, I have seen them abroad, but there have been no such publications in our country. Now, Lian Jun Kepei has spared no effort, thought deeply, and studied diligently, accomplishing what others could not, and has resolutely written this book. After reviewing it, I find it rich, accurate, and practical, with many original materials. Its content and structure are nearly unparalleled, and I greatly admire his hard work and the far-reaching significance of the book. As it is about to be published, he asked me to write a preface. Therefore, I have hastily written this to comply with his request. However, I have a strong feeling about this. The Chinese people have traditionally not paid attention to water hygiene. I sincerely hope that those who read this book can apply it in practice and make efforts to disinfect water, so that the cruel bacteria can be eliminated invisibly, and the severe epidemics can be prevented from raging. This is not only what the author deeply desires, but also a great blessing for the public.

### Inaugural Address

— Juan

In this human world, every sentient being is endowed with a pair of bright, sparkling eyes. It is impossible for them not to love beautiful things. Looking up, when they see the rosy clouds in the sky, they cannot help but exclaim, "Ah, what beautiful clouds!" Seeing the mottled and bizarre cloud formations, they cannot help but exclaim, "Ah, what beautiful clouds!" After a summer rain, seeing the rainbow spanning the sky, they will dance and shout, "Look, look! This rainbow is just like a five-colored silk ribbon, how beautiful it is!" In addition, the evening sun and the moonlit night, the green waters and the verdant hills, are all materials for praise. Once they are beautified by the pens of poets, they are described even more vividly.

Because people are naturally fond of beauty, everyone, regardless of gender or age, knows how to decorate themselves. Natural beauty may have some unsatisfactory aspects, so they have to borrow some artificial beauty. As a result, clever scientists have invented various cosmetics to meet their needs.

Women's love of beauty is natural and has been so since ancient times, and it is even more intense today. This is an undeniable fact. Although the ancients had the warning of "ostentatious appearance leads to immorality," it ultimately cannot stop women from loving beauty. Therefore, the continuous innovation of cosmetics is inevitable. Worried individuals believe that women in this great era should share the responsibility of saving the nation with men and should no longer spend effort on beautification. However, loving beauty is their nature and cannot be corrected. Within possible limits, it is permissible to let them decorate themselves, as long as they do not indulge in extravagance.

Our publication of this beauty magazine is not to promote extravagance, but to inspire women to take beauty as the first step and then pay attention to "spiritual beauty." What is "spiritual beauty?" It is the maintenance of personality and the cultivation of morality, and it requires achieving the step of "self-respect and integrity" in addition to loving natural beauty.

### The "94" Standards of Feminine Beauty

— KS

Feminine beauty is very difficult to achieve in its entirety. Even with the power of beauty and makeup, only a portion can be improved. The quest for a 'perfect beauty' seems to have been pursued for decades across ancient and modern times, yet it remains undiscovered.

The composition of 'perfect beauty' includes many elements, namely:

A. Innate
B. Acquired
C. Nutritional
D. Exercise-related
E. Educational
F. Decorative
G. Cosmetic
H. Other...

The conditions for beauty in women today belong to one of these elements. They are limited by their environment or education, preventing them from fully developing the conditions for beauty in a balanced way. This is a fact. No matter how many women you gather to choose from, the result will always be attending to one thing while neglecting another.

However, what should the appearance of a typical beautiful woman be like? An Arabian poet with scientific interests finally provided an answer, listing the '94' standard.

Here are the contents of the nine categories with four elements each:

A. Four Blacks: (1) Hair, (2) Eyelashes, (3) Eyebrows, (4) Pupils.
B. Four Whites: (1) Skin, (2) Sclera (Whites of the eyes), (3) Teeth, (4) Legs.
C. Four Reds: (1) Tongue, (2) Lips, (3) Gums, (4) Cheeks.
D. Four Round: (1) Head, (2) Neck, (3) Arms, (4) Ankles.
E. Four Long: (1) Back, (2) Fingers, (3) Arms, (4) Legs.
F. Four Wide: (1) Forehead, (2) Eyes, (3) Shoulders, (4) Hips.
G. Four Narrow: (1) Eyebrows, (2) Nose, (3) Lips, (4) Waist.
H. Four Small: (1) Ears, (2) Mouth, (3) Hands, (4) Feet.
I. Four Full: (1) Cheeks, (2) Legs, (3) Hips, (4) Breasts.

However, the nine-four standard set by the Arabian poet is only a general ideal of beauty. If a 'model' that meets this nine-four standard were placed before a painter today, the painter would certainly find it lacking, because there are many more mysterious conditions of beauty that the Arabian poet forgot.

Fundamental Beauty Techniques

### Beauty and Dietary Hygiene

— Ying Gong

To achieve a beautiful and delicate complexion, one should focus on diet. This is the fundamental method. Pay attention to basic hygiene and the environment. Once these issues are resolved, and with the addition of scientific methods, the complexion will naturally become beautiful and delicate. For example, the diet should not be too salty. Drink a glass of boiled water before meals and eat some fruit after meals. Avoid excessive liver fire and lust, and avoid overworking the mind. Keep the residence clean. By doing so, you can be said to have fully achieved the basic methods.

However, although this is said, it is very difficult to achieve in reality, because most people find it difficult to control lust and overwork the mind. As a result, even before old age, the wrinkles on the forehead are like chicken skin. If not treated, it will be a significant obstacle to beauty. The treatment method is to rub a cream into the wrinkles every night, then rub horizontally with your fingers until the skin turns red. However, when rubbing, it should be gentle rather than heavy, otherwise, it will be injured. As for wrinkles around the mouth and corners of the eyes, this method should also be used, but vertical wrinkles should be rubbed horizontally, and horizontal wrinkles should be rubbed vertically. The treatment is the same for wrinkles everywhere. However, before massaging, it is necessary to steam the face with heat first. The method is to prepare a basin of boiling water, add a small spoonful of borax powder, place it on the stove, soak a neatly folded towel in it, and then press it on the face, replacing it several times to make the skin hot, lasting for ten minutes. After the skin is cleaned, the pores will gradually expand, and then use the rubbing cream, which can penetrate the pores and make the skin soft, and the wrinkles will be easily smoothed out!

In addition, the skin can be kept white all year round by preventing sunlight and cold wind from directly contacting the face. Therefore, in winter, to protect the complexion, it is essential to apply face cream before going out. Snow cream, which is popular recently, is one of the face creams, but it is best to choose a high-quality one. Also, avoid sweating, because sweat contains a lot of salt, which easily turns the skin black when exposed to sunlight. If you return from a long journey or under the scorching sun, use lemon juice to rub gently, then wash with clean water to remove any blackness.

### Beauty Requires Frequent Bathing

— Xinhua

A person's appearance, apart from natural beauty, inevitably has many shortcomings. To correct these shortcomings, one should study beauty methods.

Beauty methods involve using colors such as red, yellow, black, and white to apply special techniques to the face, making the lines obvious, blurring the shadows, changing the viewer's line of sight, and making it more beautiful. There are also treatments that use drugs or surgery to change the original appearance. This is a treatment, not a beauty method. However, neither the use of colors nor drugs is a fundamental beauty method.

The fundamental beauty method is simple and easy to implement: frequent bathing. This method is very common, but after the famous American beautician Walker promoted it, everyone recognized that this method has the greatest effect.

Indeed, the physiological effect of warm water bathing has a significant meaning for the skin. We should know that there are countless blood vessels in the skin, distributed like a fine network. A large portion of our total blood volume, almost half of it, is stored in the skin. After bathing, the skin is stimulated by warmth, and the blood vessels in the skin are bound to dilate. This is enough to increase the function of skin activity, enhance the skin's resistance and endocrine function. Therefore, the pores of the skin will not be blocked, and the sweat and fat on the skin surface are easily removed. If one can bathe every day, how can the face not be beautiful?

Chinese women only know how to use rouge and powder excessively, but do not understand the common sense that bathing can beautify the skin, which causes the skin to be covered with dirt, which is a great mistake. It should be known that if the skin is not stimulated, the blood vessels will never dilate. At the same time, the blood vessels in the brain will also contract, and the blood circulation in the head will become stagnant. Old and waste products will accumulate and not move, which causes freckles to grow and the face to age. Even with good makeup, it is difficult to help. If one can bathe frequently, one can bring out natural beauty within a month. This fundamental beauty method not only saves the consumption of rouge and powder but also achieves physical health. Why not do it?

### How to Make Your Face Rosy

— Jun

Loving beauty is human nature, especially for women. They spend a lot of time on applying makeup every day. In fact, if makeup is used properly, it can indeed enhance beauty, but if it is not used properly, it can become ugly.

A beautiful face is often considered to be rosy, as for what kind of face shape, such as oval, melon seed, or round, I don't think it matters much. As long as you can style your hair properly, and the tailoring and colors of your clothes are well-matched, you will be admired.

But then again, we still rely on artificial means to beautify ourselves effectively. The usual beauty techniques involve applying foundation with powder or snow cream, then applying fragrant powder, then applying rouge, and then applying fragrant powder again, and adding lipstick. This can be said to be a powdered beauty, but it is not yet a jade carving, and it does not have the moving beauty of being red-wrapped and white, or white with a reddish glow.

If you want your face to be white, delicate, and rosy, you can use the following methods:

(1) Every morning when you wake up, rub your face with both hands fifty or sixty times.

(2) After washing your face, apply human milk to your face and wash it off after five minutes.

(3) Every night, apply egg white (that is, egg white) and wash it off after fifteen minutes.

(4) Before going to bed, rub your face fifty or sixty times, and then apply pure honey water and high-quality palace powder.

(5) The face powder used must be high-quality and lead-free fragrant powder.

If you follow the above methods and implement them continuously every day, you will see results in a year and a half.

### Fat and Thin

— Gu Chunxu

—Pay attention to food intake—

Everyone knows that being too thin or too fat is a great disadvantage to beauty. Therefore, the first basic step in seeking beauty is to figure out how to make yourself neither fat nor thin, and meet the standards of health and beauty. According to medical experts, a person's weight has a lot to do with what they eat every day. Therefore, if you feel that you are too fat or too thin, you only need to pay attention to what you eat to help treat obesity or thinness.

(1) Thinning method: Thin people should eat more fatty meat, grilled meat (slightly raw), lard, chicken oil, olive oil, cream, white tower, eggs, soup, bread crusts, noodles, sweets, etc. In terms of fruits, you should eat more fatty ones such as almonds, walnuts, coconuts, chestnuts, dates, and olives. Certain vegetables such as cabbage, spinach, radishes, and tomatoes should not be eaten too much. Smoking is strictly forbidden.

(2) Obesity treatment method: The only method to treat obesity is to eat less. In particular, you must avoid the following types of fatty foods: fatty meat, butter, and all foods sold in butcher shops. Among fish, you should also avoid eating seawater fish such as sardines and squid. Other foods to avoid include soy sauce, foods containing starch, pastries, chocolates, candies, juices, beer, spirits, and yellow wine.

Treating obesity and thinness is not very difficult. As long as you can be patient and determined, and weigh yourself every week, the effectiveness will be seen.

### The Three Movements of Beauty

— Qing

"Loving beauty" is human nature, especially for young girls. Although the old feudal idea of "a woman dresses for the one who pleases her" has long been eliminated by the times, in any different environment, every woman seems to need to maintain her feminine beauty. Now, the three movements of beauty for women of the era (1) face (2) hands and feet (3) body are briefly described below:

(1) Face: Facial beauty is more important than any other part, so never let dirt or grease get into the pores. When washing, you should use a towel with a texture suitable for the size of the pores to wipe it clean, and then apply some beauty lotion or moisturizer. Special attention should also be paid to the use of lipstick and rouge. If you apply some deep red color of rouge on your face, it will not only not feel beautiful, but will instead be like a monkey's kidney, making people disgusted. Therefore, the rouge should be applied evenly and lightly. It is decided that the eyebrows should not be too straight, causing a fierce look, nor should they be too drooping, which will make you look sad. It is best to apply some eye shadow for a better look.

(2) Hands and feet: The hands often secrete oil and sweat without being noticed, so they should be wiped off with a soft towel at any time, and then apply some almond honey or moisturizer. The decoration of the fingers should maintain natural beauty. Truly beautiful and generous women do not like to apply nail polish. The beauty of the "feet" is roughly the same as that of the "hands," but it is very unsightly to dye the toes with red and green colors, because this can easily be mistaken for a fallen woman.

(3) Body: The fat and thinness of the body is very related to "feminine beauty." Being too fat or too thin is unacceptable. Therefore, if you find that your body is too fat, it is because you are eating too much all day long and lacking exercise. Therefore, fitness exercises are necessary. If you find that your body is too thin, then nutrition should be sufficient and labor should not be excessive. This is the secret to turning a weak body into a strong one. Also, taking a bath often is also an important element in maintaining feminine beauty. When bathing, glycerin soap and bath salts are indispensable. Then, scrub carefully with a sponge or loofah, and finally gently apply beauty lotion. This will definitely make the skin smooth and delicate.

Beauty and Makeup

### Beauty Experiences

— Jiaren

People's views vary from Chinese to foreign people. Foreigners consider yellow hair to be beautiful, so-called "blonde beauties." However, the Chinese consider black hair to be beautiful, because black hair is shiny, which is more than enough to set off the whiteness of the skin. However, many Chinese people have yellow hair. If you want to turn it black, you can wash it daily with water soaked in several sheets of wild vegetable leaves. After two or three times, it can gradually turn black.

If the pores on the face are too large, after washing your face every morning, you can use skin-tightening beauty water, pour it into a small cotton pad, and wipe the face around to tighten the skin's pores. The preparation method of beauty water can use "potassium alum" five grams, "Cologne alcohol" eight hundred cc, and "orange blossom water" one hundred and ninety-five cc.

People with thin faces should apply rouge between the nose and cheekbones. People with round faces should apply rouge on the cheekbones, and should not apply it near the nose.

For men and women with protruding foreheads, if you want to cover up their shape, you can only rely on makeup. When applying makeup, you can apply powder evenly elsewhere, but you can choose not to apply it on the forehead. This will make it feel much flatter. If you mix a little blue into the powder, you can also cover up the shape. This is completely based on optical principles and is indeed effective.

### Lip Makeup

— Lin

In today's society with open communication, the makeup of girls' faces is indeed a matter that cannot be ignored; especially the makeup on the lips, which is even more important. Because all facial movements are expressed through the mouth and eyes. In Western European countries, where the custom of kissing men and women prevails, the lips are even more important.

Most women seem to have very little cultivation in applying lipstick, and very few understand the art of applying lipstick. They simply apply it all over their mouths, making it look like blood, which makes people disgusted. Therefore, I specifically wrote the method of lip makeup for readers to refer to. After applying the powder on the face, first rub the upper and lower lips with a piece of scented honey several times, then apply the lipstick on the upper lip. After applying the lipstick on the upper lip, close your lips tightly and touch the lipstick on the upper lip to cover the lower lip. Then, use a brush to gradually smooth it evenly according to the position of the lipstick applied, and then cover the lips with a piece of silk cloth rich in water absorption to let it absorb the color that is too bright red, making it a color that is red but not bright, and light but not strong. This is success.

Everyone's lips must have different widths and thicknesses. The above lipstick application method refers to lips that generally meet the standard of beauty. If your lips are suffering from the problem of thickness or narrowness, then you have to perform a cosmetic surgery.

If your lips are too thick, you can apply lipstick on the inside of the edge of the lips, and at the same time apply a dark-colored lipstick on the inside of the lips, so that it will not appear too thick.

If your lips are too thin, you can use lipstick to lengthen the lip skin and apply light red inside. If your lips are too big, you should apply dark lipstick on the inside of the lips, and at the same time shorten the length of the lipstick on the corners of the mouth. Apply light-colored lipstick to form a properly sized lip, so that it will not feel too large.

With these methods, it is not difficult to get a skillful skill on the makeup of other deformed lips. As long as you carefully consider the length and angle, and carefully use lipsticks in dark colors, no matter how deformed the lips are, they can be transformed into standard beautiful lips.

### Eye Makeup

— Xinhua Yu

—The Relationship of Eyelashes—

"Beautiful eyes and a charming smile," "A smile that can overthrow cities," which shows that beautiful eyes are the most important condition for beauty; "If you want beauty, you must first have beautiful eyes," is also a self-evident motto in beauty. The makeup of beautiful eyes is concisely written below.

If you want your eyes to be beautiful, you must use eyelashes to set them off. To set off the eyelashes, you must use a kind of emphasis color. This color is called mascara. When applying it, use a small brush, lightly dip a little mascara, and slowly brush it on the eyelashes, thicker on the upper eyelashes and lighter on the lower eyelashes. However, when performing this technique, the mouth must be opened, otherwise the eyelids will flash and close constantly, and the mascara will be applied to the eyelids, which will take time to wipe off and is too uneconomical.

After drawing the eyelashes, draw a fine line on the lower side of the lower eyelid. This line is very laborious. The line should be slightly lighter in the center of the eyelid, slightly thicker near the ear, and lighter on both sides near the bridge of the nose than in the center. After drawing, use your little finger to rub the lines and lines together, so that the outline of the cheek fat and the lines blend together. In this way, the beauty of beautiful eyes and a charming smile can be brought into play.

This kind of makeup technique must rely on your own surgery. If you go to consult a beauty salon, then you will be like a certain girl whose face turned into hemp skin, and you will be involved in a lawsuit, which is unnecessary.

### Teeth and Beauty

— Lu Dehong

Protecting your teeth is also a part of beauty, because it not only directly enhances the beauty of your face, but also indirectly promotes your physical health, making your complexion rosy and your skin clean and delicate. With these two basic conditions, plus your regular features, then your beauty problem, without much research or discussion, you are already the reincarnation of Song Yu or Pan An, even Xi Shi can't compare to your beauty. Therefore, this kind of beauty method that achieves twice the result with half the effort and has extremely significant effects, I think readers should all pay attention to it.

Before talking about how to protect your teeth, let's first introduce the teeth of a few movie stars. Loretta Young goes to the dentist every week to have a check-up. She asks the doctor to check if she has any misalignments that don't meet dental standards. Marjorie Weaver has a private dentist who checks her every two weeks. She doesn't suffer from dental diseases either, she asks the dentist how to maintain her pearly white teeth. Diana Durbin's mother said: When Durbin was three years old, I tried my best to pay attention to her teeth, so that she would grow up with a healthy and beautiful set of teeth. This is just a casual introduction of a few examples. Almost all the red stars on the Hollywood silver screen have their teeth checked at least once a month. From this, it can be seen that their emphasis on teeth is self-evident. When we see them smile on the screen, revealing a set of white and neat teeth, we can't help but feel a little envious, but there is no need to be envious, here I can introduce you to an effective method of protecting teeth.

In addition to a few common basic conditions for protecting dental hygiene, it is best to implement all of the following, then it is not difficult for your teeth to reach the standard.

(1) Daily precautions:

1.  Be sure to rinse your mouth and brush your teeth after getting up and after each meal. When brushing, be sure to brush up and down, not left and right randomly, so that residual dirt and grime cannot be completely wiped away, because the grime often contains acidity, which can destroy the enamel of the teeth and cause various dental diseases.

2.  Do not eat excessively hard, sweet, sour, cold, or hot irritating foods, because excessively hard foods easily injure teeth, which is very dangerous. Excessively sweet and sour foods easily produce acidity, and excessively cold and hot foods easily irritate and contract the teeth, resulting in symptoms that damage the dental nerves at different heights, front and back.

3.  Do not use toothpaste, tooth powder, or various substitutes (such as mouthwash, etc.) of poor quality, because poor quality stain removers often contain too much acid. Toothpaste is easy to use, but it is also easy to damage teeth, so you should try to avoid using it. It is best to use fruit juice, such as apple juice.

4.  Do not use hard-bristled toothbrushes, but use soft and moderate ones. In addition to the toothbrush used for brushing teeth, prepare a small brush (available at Western pharmacies) to brush the concave seams between the teeth and places that cannot be reached by the large brush.

5.  Do not eat too much, because overeating often leads to teeth grinding in dreams (commonly known as teeth chattering); because overeating is not easy to digest, and indigestion causes the above symptoms and damages the teeth.

6.  The only way to correct the height, front and back, and unevenness of teeth is to consult a dentist, because they have special and sophisticated instruments, but adults are not as easy to correct as young children, so parents should always pay attention to their children's teeth. In short, the impact of teeth on appearance, there is no need to explain as above, it is already very clear. I remember not long ago, it was fashionable in Shanghai to inlay gold teeth and Indian-style emerald heart teeth, but now they have been almost completely eliminated, but thinking about it carefully, they also used teeth to beautify their appearance.

### How to Avoid Skin Wrinkles

— Jinghua

In winter, when the northwest wind rises, the skin will wrinkle and crack. What is the reason for this? It turns out that the reason why the skin is elastic and soft is that the fat under the skin constantly supplies nutrients to the skin. When the skin is nourished by this fat, it naturally shows fullness and elasticity on the epidermis. In winter, after the subcutaneous fat is blown by the northwest wind, it cannot function as vigorously as in warm weather. Because the subcutaneous fat cannot fully perform its function, the metabolism of the skin is also affected and hindered. Therefore, the skin wrinkles and cracks in winter.

The richness and elasticity of the skin is a necessary condition for beauty, and wrinkles and cracks in the skin are enough to destroy this beauty. To avoid wrinkles and cracks in the skin, the method is very simple, and there is no need to spend a lot of money to buy elaborate glycerin and powder creams to apply. What I want to introduce is honey or milk curd.

Honey can be bought for a few cents at Chinese herbal medicine stores; milk curd includes cow's milk or human milk, but cow's milk is better and easier to obtain. Just leave the leftovers, which is enough to use. These two things can provide the skin with extremely good nutrition and can make the skin's metabolism flourish. It is really the best cosmetic to avoid skin wrinkles. The method of use is enough to apply three or four times a week, too much is not suitable. The time of application should be more convenient before going to bed at night. Before applying, wash your face clean, and then apply a thin layer of diluted honey or milk liquid. After doing this several times, you will definitely get considerable results.

In addition, more exercise of the face can also reduce the state of skin wrinkling; but how to exercise the face? This is also very simple. When talking and laughing, make some facial expressions, such as making a face... which is the method of facial exercise.

### Standard Beauty Technique

— Zhitong

What is the standard beauty technique? In my opinion, the first thing is to use domestic products. Even if you use imported cosmetics, it can't be considered beautiful! Secondly, is the selection of materials. Among domestic products, the Wuzhou Pharmacy, with its pharmaceutical experience, produces several kinds of cosmetics, which are generally considered to be very exquisite. The following cosmetic procedures can be used as a reference for ladies:

(1) Washing the face: Use "Guben Soap" to wash away the dirt on the face, and the skin will immediately feel comfortable.

(2) Brushing teeth: After washing the face, brush your teeth with "Wuzhou 131 Toothpaste". The teeth are white and the mouth is refreshed.

(3) Applying honey: Apply a little bit of Planet Brand "Skin Nourishing Pure Honey" on various parts of the hands and face to stimulate blood circulation and moisturize the skin.

(4) Applying cream: Then apply "Yipin Xiang Xuehua Cream" on the face to make the complexion fair, shiny and smooth.

(5) Arranging the hair: Finally, sprinkle "131 Fragrant Hair Water" on the hairline and comb it with a comb. The fragrance is rich.

According to the above method, not only is the purpose of beauty achieved, but also the responsibility of using domestic products is fulfilled, which is called the standard beauty technique. Who says it is not suitable?

### From Beauty to Strengthening the Body

— Xinsheng

Beauty only refers to the appearance, while strengthening the body refers to the entire body, which seems not to be confused.

However, the current era is no longer an era that only values ​​appearance and does not value the body. In the eyes of most people, undoubtedly, only healthy and beautiful women and men can be regarded as typical women and men.

In the novels of the past: Jia Baoyu, with a face like powder, and Lin Daiyu, who was weak and frail, these characters representing male and female beauty have become historical relics and have become outdated!

Therefore, fitness and beauty really need to be discussed side by side. In other words, it is necessary to have a beautiful appearance and also pay attention to the health of the body. Moreover, a strong body naturally leads to a plump, beautiful and lovely face.

The only way to fitness is to replenish the body with nutrients. To replenish the body with nutrients, you must take effective tonics. The most famous tonics in modern times are the following:

(1) Artificial Automatic Blood, it has been popular for decades and has always been trusted and praised by users. Its efficacy is to specifically replenish the body's precious blood. Therefore, if someone has a pale complexion and suffers from anemia and weakness, their complexion will turn rosy after taking Automatic Blood for a month, and the various symptoms caused by anemia will gradually heal.

(2) Wuzhou Milk White Cod Liver Oil is made with the latest manufacturing machinery and has been rigorously tested. The vitamins it contains to nourish the human body are accurate and abundant, reaching the top. Drinking it will expand the lungs and develop muscles.

(3) Earth Brand Malt Cod Liver Oil is sweet and palatable, with no fishy smell at all. Everyone can take it. It can replenish deficiency and treat the lungs. Its efficacy is very certain and has long been well-known, because cod liver oil and malt paste are both ingredients that are rich in vital elements.

Select and take the above three tonics, and you will be strong, energetic, and able to achieve your wish for fitness and beauty.

### Advantages of 131 Toothpaste

— Min

Wuzhou 131 Toothpaste is made with special ingredients containing dirt removal, stain removal, sterilization and disinfection. The material is pure and the smell is fragrant. Cleaning teeth is the purpose of using it, and oral disinfection also has a main function. It is really a necessary hygiene product for protecting teeth and cleaning the mouth. Now, let me briefly describe the characteristics of its ingredients and combination:

(1) "Calcium carbonate" is the main raw material of general toothpaste. This product is no exception, but the calcium carbonate selected is crystalline powder that can pass through a 140-eye sieve, and transparent particles can be observed under a 500x microscope.

(2) "Magnesium Milk" is an extremely fine colloidal emulsion made by digesting magnesium oxide. The light return is sufficient to neutralize the acidity caused by the fermentation of food residues left in the tooth gaps. It is another major ingredient in 131 toothpaste for cleaning teeth.

(3) "Base Agent" Astragalus gum is extremely gentle and non-irritating. It is used together with the Chinese Pharmacopoeia starch glycerin to form a thick, soft and transparent gelatinous substance. Its thickness does not change over the years. When rubbing the teeth, it can also play a lubricating role without the use of soap. Therefore, 131 toothpaste uses this type of base agent.

(4) "Disinfectant" Thymol, methyl salicylate, eugenol, phenyl salicylate are mixed with menthol, etc., to form an aromatic bactericidal disinfectant. 131 Spearhead toothpaste contains this kind of medicine in its fragrance. The main purpose of gargling after use is for oral disinfection, and its fragrance is only secondary.

(5) "Features of Preparation" The substantive filling materials used in 131 toothpaste, such as the above-mentioned calcium and magnesium, exert the effect of cleaning teeth by means of wiping, just like stain removal powder wiping porcelain. If these substances are selected carelessly, they will damage the tooth enamel. Now, we use crystalline calcium carbonate with a 140-eye sieve and colloidal magnesium milk. The hardness is always between 3 and 3.5, which is a degree of distance from the tooth enamel hardness of 4 to 4.5. Therefore, there is absolutely no disadvantage of damaging the tooth enamel. It is the only 131 toothpaste that can quickly remove stains without making noise when used. It is the most special of its characteristics.

### Skin Beauty and Tooth Beauty

— Ai

Modern ladies believe that using soap is a very important thing, because the skin has to come into contact with soap every morning and evening. If inferior soap is used, the skin will suffer adverse damage!

"Guben Soap" is a valuable soap. Its quality and fragrance are above those of imported products. It is suitable for washing the face and bathing. It can make the skin undergo a kind of metabolism, and there is no harm of irritation. Therefore, using "Guben Soap" at night is to give the skin insurance.

The teeth of a person not only have the function of chewing, but also occupy a very important position in the appearance. When talking and smiling, the teeth must be revealed, so we must pay attention to beautifying the teeth as deeply as the other parts.

Brushing your teeth with "Wuzhou 131 Toothpaste" fills your mouth with foam, which is fragrant and palatable. After use, your teeth are clean, white, shiny and lovely.

### Talking about the Manufacturing Process of Guben Soap

— Reporter

The "Guben Laundry Soap" produced by Wuzhou Guben Soap is famous throughout the country. The "Guben Soap" produced is of excellent quality and has a clear and elegant fragrance. It is a popular domestic soap. Now, let me talk about the process of manufacturing it: "The oils used by Guben Soap are slightly different from those used by Guben Household Soap. Generally, it is mainly composed of tallow, coconut oil, and castor oil. The manufacturing method is the same as that of making laundry soap. It is to first mix the oils and alkalize them to make lime soap, but another boiler is used for cooking. After the soap is made, it is injected into a soap rolling and cooling machine to condense it into blocks, then cut into long strips, and the strips are placed in a glass vacuum room for bleaching. After several months of long time, wait for it to be clean and white. When it is about to be used, move it to a drying room with a rotating device. There is a slicing machine on the upper part of the room. Take the clean and white long strips of soap and put them into the slicing machine, slice them into flakes, and then spread them on several layers of copper wire mesh in the room by the rotating device and bake them. After one or two hours, move a certain amount of soap into the mixing machine, add spices and pigments, and turn on the wheels to stir it for one hour. Move it into the grinder and repeat it several times. After the spices and pigments are very mixed, move it into the rotating pushing machine. Its interior is like a spiral shaft, and the soap is rolled out by the spiral. Its products can replace various models, so you can make round or square shapes from the pushing machine. The long strips are cut into small pieces with a separator, and then moved to a printing car for printing and placed in a shallow wooden grid and moved to another vacuum drying room. After drying, after a week of a long time, it is sent to the packaging room to be packaged into boxes and can be sold.

The reason why Wuzhou Guben Household Soap can be of good quality and popular is because it is manufactured using the Gerlach-Beetz indirect method, which cannot be compared with the direct method in which other factories only mix oil and caustic soda; the manufacturing process of "Guben Soap" also uses the same super-special method, and it is no wonder that its products are extraordinary.

### Beauty Storm

— Qiaoming

Many leaves fall in the corners, gradually fading from withered green to scorched yellow, and the water splashed on the ground freezes into ice in a moment. This symbolizes that the severe winter is extending its power.

This is Mr. Chen's home, and a small storm suddenly broke out. The reason is - Mr. Chen bought back a bottle of skin care products, and he handed it to his wife with great pride.

"Did you buy it back? How much does a bottle cost?" the wise Mrs. Chen asked.

"One dollar and twenty cents a bottle," Mr. Chen replied.

"A small bottle of something costs one dollar and twenty cents? Too expensive! Too expensive!"

"It's a time-honored foreign brand. The quality is very good."

"Are you a foreign goods worshiper?" Mrs. Chen immediately darkened her face. She said sternly: "In this era, everyone knows to promote domestic goods, but you want to be a salesperson for foreign goods. You know that foreign goods are good, but do you know that domestic goods have been improving very quickly over the years? Besides, putting foreign goods on your face, even if it's beautiful, it's still ugly. You can abandon the root and pursue the tip, but I can't make a fool of myself!"

Mr. Chen was speechless by Mrs. Chen.

A few days later, Mrs. Chen went to the Wuzhou Pharmacy and bought a one-pound can of beauty cream back.

"Look! This is a domestic product. It only costs 75 cents and can be used by our whole family for a winter," Mrs. Chen said proudly.

Mr. Chen did not speak. He was obviously defeated in this storm!

### A Scene of Fragrant Hair

— Pinghou

Love is human nature, especially for young girls in general, they are of course the love of love.

Xiao Lei is also one of the loving girls. She has cultivated her temperament to be so lively, she has exercised her body to be so beautiful and healthy, and she has repaired her appearance to be so beautiful! She is a flower, a pure and lovely flower.

One day, Manna - Xiao Lei's friend - walked into Xiao Lei's bedroom. Xiao Lei was just preparing to go out. He was holding a bottle of fragrant hair water and sprinkling it on his head.

"Sister Lei"!

"Is that Sister Manna? Where did you come from?"

"I just came back from visiting the domestic goods market. You smell really good!" Manna said with a smile while holding Xiao Lei's hand. "Yes, it smells very good. This is a bottle of high-quality fragrant hair water that I bought from a department store the day before yesterday," Xiao Lei said as he showed Manna the bottle of "Red-Clad Man Fragrant Hair Water" in her hand.

"Is this fragrant hair water really high-quality? But sprinkling it on your head doesn't necessarily mean it's a glorious fragrance! Because you've already become an unpatriotic person."

"I also know that using foreign goods will cause the outflow of rights and interests. However, it seems that only foreign goods are good for things like fragrant hair..."

"Sister Lei: You're wrong! Do you know that domestic goods have been improving very quickly in recent years? Even for cosmetics like fragrant hair water, there are good ones among domestic goods, but you just haven't looked for them. Why do you always have to be superstitious about foreign goods?…"

Manna said so solemnly, and Xiao Lei was greatly moved. She smashed the bottle in her hand heavily on the ground, indicating that she would never be superstitious about foreign goods from now on.

A few days later, Xiao Lei was very newly emerging in finding a domestic fragrant hair water that satisfied her. The one she found was the "131 Fragrant Hair Water" exquisitely produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy.

### Beauty New Secrets

— Zhi Xi

To Make Skin Tender: Before applying any makeup each day, first soak paper in cold water, wring it out gently so it is not too wet, and apply it to the face. This causes the skin to contract in the cold. Then, apply cucumber juice or loofah juice (a plant-based makeup water can be made by chopping fresh cucumber or loofah, wrapping it in silk cloth, and squeezing out the juice. After it settles, drip some into your palm and rub it on your face). This will not only prevent the skin from becoming rough, but will also make it fine, tender, and smooth.

For Oily and Rosy Cheeks: Generally, people with oily faces have excessive sebum secretion. Rub your face daily with a fat-free makeup water to gradually stretch the skin and gently stimulate the skin tissues, which will reduce the oiliness. The method is as follows: First, soak a towel in hot water and moisten the face. Then, add a few drops of apple dew and honey to your palm, rub them together, and pat onto your face. Wait for it to dry, then soak alum (available in pharmacies) in water and gently rub it on your face once. This will make the skin rosy.

For Sweaty Faces: For sweaty faces, first wash with apple cider vinegar, then mix two parts of alum, one part of Tian Hua powder, and five parts of talc. Mix with water each morning and apply once to naturally reduce sweating.

Eliminating Wrinkles: Young women's skin tissues are firm and dense. If wrinkles appear on the face, first wash your face with cold water to stimulate the skin, then rub it with a rough cloth until the face becomes red and hot. Alternatively, rubbing with milk and honey can also eliminate wrinkles.

Purple-Black Complexion: A purple-black complexion is caused by poor blood circulation. Taking arsenic pills regularly can make the skin whiter and more tender. However, avoid drinking tea before and after taking arsenic pills, and pay close attention.

Rough Lips: Rough lips are unsightly. Mix one part talc, two parts Resorcinol, and five parts gum arabic with five parts distilled water. Apply once after washing your face each time to make the lips fine and rosy.

The above methods are all derived from experimentation. Ladies and misses of the era, feel free to try them; they are sure to be effective.

A Casual Talk on Makeup
— Song Guang

Modern women's understanding of makeup is limited to knowing how to apply powder, rouge, or at most, lipstick. Some other women think that makeup must be dramatic and exaggerated, like a theatrical actor's heavy makeup, but both of these are erroneous views.

When women are in the makeup section, they are often tempted by the decoration and fragrance of the cosmetics, forgetting to distinguish the quality of the powder, rouge, and lipstick. At the same time, they forget to consider whether the colors suit their own complexion, because inferior quality products often cause adverse reactions when applied to the face. - Powder lacking water absorption will turn into a pasty film when exposed to sweat. Powder containing starch will swell when wet with sweat, causing blotches on the face. It may also fail to adhere firmly to the skin and easily fall off, so it must be repeatedly applied. After repeated application, the powder layer accumulates unevenly. Therefore, using this kind of inferior powder not only fails to achieve the effect of makeup, but also makes the face unattractive. A powder color that does not match one's skin tone also ruins the natural beauty of the face.

Ladies and misses! You already know that women should use powder, rouge, etc. to apply makeup, but what is the meaning of makeup? In a narrow sense, makeup is a technical and artistic method of achieving beauty. In a broad sense, makeup is to cater to one's skin tone conditions, using the harmony of cosmetic colors to enhance natural beauty.

Now that we understand the meaning of makeup, of course we should start applying makeup - let me show you step by step:

The steps for applying powder should start from the lower part of the cheeks, gradually reaching the center of the face, and finally applying to the nose. The most important thing to pay attention to is the area between the nose and cheeks. If the powder is not applied firmly, it is easy to reveal the original skin tone. However, applying too much powder is also a problem. Therefore, the powder in the area between the nose and cheeks should be thicker than other parts. It is important to pay attention to the size relationship of the face. For people with large face shapes, the contours of the face should be applied with dark powder. For people with narrow faces, the area where the nose and eyes meet should be applied with light powder.

After completing the powdering process, you should tidy up a bit. Use a powder brush to gently brush away the powder that is too thick in various places. This will make it look even, soft, and more beautiful.

The most taboo thing when applying rouge is "smearing." Because smearing rouge on seems too stiff. Therefore, when applying rouge, it should be patted on slowly, from dark to light, in an arc shape, looking like a natural embellishment.

The patting sequence should start from the upper tip of the cheeks, move along the curve of the cheekbones, and gradually towards the eye near the nose and cheeks. Some should also be patted on the orbital bone to make the obvious edges disappear. This looks just like a natural blush, very lovely.

"Lips are the windows of speech." Therefore, lips are kind, gentle, passionate, and full of infinitely sweet memories. They often contain the characteristics of strong emotional impulses and are even strangely flavorful, evoking reverie and mysterious allure.

When applying lipstick, you should first wipe your lips dry with a soft towel, because lipstick will only adhere to dry lips. Then, apply it according to the contour of the lip shape. Next, close your lips tightly and imprint the lipstick already applied on the upper lip onto the lower lip. Then, dab and smear the lipstick up and down. Isn't it symmetrical this way?

After finishing the lipstick work, you should take care of the corners of the mouth or the edges of the lips to make the lines disappear. At the same time, use your index finger to even out the lipstick on the upper and lower lips. Finally, moisten your lips, then showing a bright and dazzling luster.

If you want to make your eyes look a little better, you have to trim your eyebrows. Eyebrows should be neither too long nor too short. It is not advisable to use an eyebrow machine to curl them, otherwise you will not only fail to please but also cause trouble. But even if they are curled, you cannot help but trim them.

As for drawing eyebrows, you should first gently apply eyeshadow cream to the upper eyelid, from the eyelashes to the eyebrows, so that it has a layer of crisp and tender radiance. When drawing eyebrows, the eyebrow pencil must move along the natural curve. When the eyebrows are slightly drawn, they should be extended slightly, which is truly endearing.

If you also like to draw eyeliner, you can gently apply a little darker eyeshadow along the eyelashes. When drawing, you must fade it out around to be natural, not too stiff, like the cartoonish black circles of Chinese movie star Tan Ying.

Misses' Problems by Ni Changmin

### Beauty Magic

— Ying Dai

Have you ever seen women whose faces sag? Their mouths tilt at the corners, their cheeks are flabby, their eyes are tired. In fact, their faces show a completely tired appearance. Even young faces can have thin and weak muscles. Sometimes this weakness is limited to one area, such as the mouth or lower eyelids. Cosmetic surgeons can use surgical methods to tighten the facial skin and correct cosmetic abnormalities. They call it a "face lift," but unfortunately, the treatment is not always effective and scares many women away. We cannot blame timid women for being afraid to take risks to correct very small flaws. In Hollywood, a new method has recently been invented to lift tired and sagging faces - this method is harmless and easy, a new beauty magic.

Sagging Mouth, for example, a common sagging mouth can make the appearance stubborn and angry. You only need to think that an angry expression requires three times more muscle movement than a smile to know why women with angry expressions look tired. Deep grooves at the corners of the mouth are a sign of being pushed down. Many women use powder to stop it, and the defect occurs because the recessed part always lacks powder. The result is a dark and invisible dimple that remains next to the corners of the mouth. Another thing that often happens, especially when women are in a hurry, is to apply lipstick in the recesses, which looks so untidy and depressed!

Raising the Mouth: But let's pay attention to the treatment method. What is the most appropriate way to correct a sagging mouth? First, when this kind of woman applies powder, she has to open her mouth, and the corners of her mouth will be tightened. In this way, even those recessed places can be powdered. Then use lipstick, and the corner of the lower lip should be painted longer, exceeding the corner of the upper lip. The reason for this is obvious. The reason for sagging is that the corner of the upper lip exceeds the length of the corner of the lower lip. Therefore, if we shorten the length of the upper lip, we can eliminate the hanging of the mouth. However, when you use lipstick, you must wipe away the excess powder. It is very important to apply powder to all downward-pushing lines around the mouth, and then brush away with a powder brush. You can use your fingers to stretch these lines so that the powder can be applied and made invisible. When applying lipstick, you should often use very little to avoid making it noticeably visible in the mouth area.

Facial Muscles: Unfortunately, flabby cheeks have become a difficult problem. It is not easy to raise them alone. This is entirely due to the weakness of the muscles. The more serious ones cannot be corrected. The usual method is to harmonize the muscles and skin. For example, rubbing with ice can strengthen the muscles. Regularly using cold towels is also a good method. This procedure should be completed five minutes before applying high-quality moisturizing cream. When using moisturizing cream, the muscles of the face do not need to be pulled. Moisturizing cream should be gently patted into the skin. Any facial movement, whether up or down, can stretch and weaken the muscles. After the face is pulled upward, this method will no longer be effective. However, regularly using skin-moisturizing creams can also strengthen the facial muscles. Using good moisturizing cream can also cover up the defect of flabby facial muscles. If moisturizing cream and rouge are applied in an artistic way, the defects can even be completely removed. Because rouge seems like

## Page 21

a covering, it can cleverly conquer the entire cheek. Softness and intelligence mixed together can create the illusion you desire.

Raising the Eyes: Now, we
are going to talk about the so-called "windows of the soul." Tired, depressed eyes are usually caused by the lower eyelids seeming to have bugs crawling on them. Dark circles under the eyes are often discovered at the same time. If you sleep a few more hours, these dark circles will not be removed, but they will fade a little. The muscles around the eyes should also be often treated with moisturizing cream to make the eyes look higher. Here is a very funny method: use an eyebrow pencil to draw a light outer line along the circumference of the eyelids. This line is then slowly stretched, crossing the outer corner of the eye and slightly upward. The eyebrows are also the same, slightly upward. Small lines and wrinkles around the eyes can also show a tired appearance. This can usually be stretched and hidden when applying powder, but the result is that the powder falls off. The powder brush can brush away any excess powder that is applied in any place.

### Lily

— Li Jun

It was early in the morning when the sun had just flashed onto the silver-white bed frame of Chloe, Miss Lily, the queen of the S Church School, had already gotten up. She was wearing a pink morning gown and standing in front of the dressing table, with her slender and curvaceous back in tow.

After washing her face, she did not immediately do her beauty routine, but only smiled faintly at the large pile of bottles of different sizes placed in front of her. The smile made her see herself in the reflection of the mirror and feel that she was too beautiful. Really, she was too beautiful. Just her two lips were redder than the Western rouge cream that Little Sun sent. No wonder the male students wanted to elect her as queen. During this festive season, she had received so many gifts: imported perfumes! Hollywood snowflake powder! Red and green, it was such a big pile that she didn't know which one to use.

Her eldest brother was her sister-in-law's "cosmetics buyer." Yesterday, he estimated the price of these gifts for her. It was said that each bottle of perfume was at least 20 yuan or more, and the snowflake creams were also Western imports worth 5 or 6 yuan or more. However, when her eldest brother picked up the bottle that Lin had sent, he threw it on the table and said, "What is this thing? It's a Chinese product bought for a few coppers, and you're giving it as a gift." This made Lily blush for a while, especially when her sister-in-law deliberately picked up the bottle and smiled.

However, Lily remembered the note that Lin had attached, which read, "Don't underestimate this worthless thing. It is a domestic product, and it represents a sincere heart's offering."

In good conscience, Lily often found Lin to be cute. She always felt that Lin was better than others. When she heard her eldest brother's ridicule of the things that Lin sent, she couldn't help but protest:

"We want to be beautiful and protect our skin. Do we have to use foreign products? Foreign products are not better than Chinese products. It's just that foreign exchange is expensive, so foreign products are more expensive. At this time, we are still giving money to foreigners for nothing. What is the point?"

Her eldest brother said, "You have the guts not to use foreign products, don't be stubborn."

"Have the guts not to use foreign products"! Lily silently recited what her eldest brother had said yesterday. She thought that Chinese beauty products were just as good, so why should she be someone without guts and create a loophole for the country?

Thinking of this, she unhesitatingly picked out the tube of domestic snowflake cream that Lin had sent and started to beautify her delicate and smooth face. After the beauty work was completed, she wrote a few similar notes and wrapped them in various cosmetics, and asked the driver, A Fu, to send them out. Those notes probably read, "Thank you very much for your gifts, but I dare not use foreign goods again, creating a double waste. Please forward them to others as appropriate."

When her sister-in-law saw her, she pulled her and said, "Sister Lily, you are dressed up especially beautifully for the New Year. After all, imported perfumes are not to be underestimated!"

Lily did not answer, but hid a secret smile in her belly. She thought, "Lin's domestic goods are not to be underestimated compared to imported beauty products!"

### A Collection of Beauty Methods

— Di Si

The treatment method is to use warm soap flake solution to wipe the face every night, then wash it clean with water.

### The True Beauty and Goodness of Life

— Physician Ding Hui Kang

Shen Bao's New Year edition has a special publication on beauty, and Lu Ziyiming asked me for a few words. I say, good! Beauty is what everyone desires. But there are many true beauties and goodnesses in life, not just beauty alone. However, the true beauties and goodnesses of life are closely related to beauty, but the world does not pay attention to them. I will especially point them out. Those who want to achieve the goal of beauty, and those who seek the true beauty and goodness of life, please pay attention.

(1) A Bright Home

A bright home is not necessarily a tall building, but one that seeks sufficient light, smooth air, bright windows and clean tables for reading, a few acres of green garden in front of the courtyard for planting flowers and bamboo, the sounds of birds and butterflies pleasing to the ears and eyes, and two or three paintings hanging on the wall as a substitute for travel. Wife and children laugh and play in it, with absolutely no sound of quarrels. The happiness of the family is complete, and the radiance of the owner is a natural result. This is one of the true beauties and goodnesses of life.

(2) A Healthy Life

The human body is like a machine, so life must have a certain rhythm. Work should adhere to the time, and not be uncontrolled, causing the body and mind to be too tired. This is the first step in a healthy life. Go to bed early and get up early, so that the body and mind can have sufficient rest. Appropriate exercise, such as sunbathing, deep breathing, walking, basketball, volleyball, swimming, etc., we must take out a little time every day to exercise the body. With a healthy life, natural beauty will naturally flow out. This is the second true beauty and goodness of life.

(3) Natural Enjoyment

Since we live in nature, the enjoyment of nature is our innate right, so why should we give it up ourselves. If we can travel once a week, climb mountains and approach water, choose scenic spots and seek out secluded places, looking at the clouds flying and understanding the illusion of the white clouds, watching the fish swimming and obtaining the pleasure of Hao Liang, the vulgar dust is exhausted, and the world is temporarily forgotten, then not only will our bodies benefit greatly, but also our souls will obtain supreme pleasure. This is an element of beauty and the third true beauty and goodness of life.

(4) A Detached Soul

The mundane world is nothing but suffering, let alone forgetting. There is not a trace of attachment in the heart, and every day the heart is full of harmony and vitality, and naturally all things revive. Su Zizhan said: The joys and sorrows of life pass by like dreams, and it is not worth pursuing. It is best to enjoy oneself from time to time. Bai Letian's poem says: What are you fighting for on the horns of snails? This body is placed in the light of flint, follow wealth and poverty and be happy, and not opening your mouth to laugh is a fool. Shi Tianji said: If a person's mind is always in harmony and joy, the color that appears on the outside will naturally be beautiful, and the inner peace in the heart will be so happy. Therefore, inner detachment has a beautiful appearance, which is the fourth true beauty and goodness of life.

(5) Appropriate Entertainment

Rest and play are important, as the ancients taught. In this modern and progressive society, mental stress is almost a common disease of modern people, and it is necessary to have appropriate entertainment to regulate it. This can be done according to each person's preferences. For example, painting the beauty of the heavens and earth, mountains and rivers, or capturing it in photography, not only pleases the mind, but also is enjoyed by the public. Or loosen your clothes in the wind and sing a song. Or play elegant music alternately and dance gracefully. All of these regulate the excessive tension of life and prevent the appearance from being affected by the excessive labor of life, which is the fifth true beauty and goodness of life.

(6) The Utilization of Science

In recent times, science has advanced, and those who seek the true beauty and goodness of life can also use science to obtain it. If anything destroys life, it is disease. Now, if someone suffers from a cough and their appearance is haggard, they can use science, such as X-ray diagnosis, pneumothorax for treating the lungs, so that the methods of prevention and early treatment can be obtained in time. This not only concerns the individual's health and beauty, but also benefits the family and society. Benefiting humanity is the highest goal of science, and it is also within the authority of science. Whether it is our desire for beauty or our desire for increased physical strength and early recovery of health, we can all use science. This is an element of creating the true beauty and goodness of life.

### "Applying the Pieces" in Peking Opera Makeup

— Xue Hong Zhaizhu

If anyone has seen the appearance of Mei Wanhua or Cheng Yushuang, or their recent casual photos, and then goes to the theater to see one of their makeup performances, they will feel strange. Why did their plump appearance become so handsome once they were on stage? So-called ancient Chinese beauty face - a pointed face. Do they really have any secrets to change their "appearance"? No, the reason why they can make their fat faces thin should be attributed to "applying the pieces."

These "pieces" are attached to the head of the Dan roles. At first glance, they seem to be connected to the hair, but they are not. The "pieces" are several separate pieces. After the initial makeup work of the Dan roles - applying powder, rouge, drawing eyebrows, drawing eye sockets, etc. - these pieces on the forehead and temples are attached, and then further makeup work is carried out. If your face is fat, you can attach the pieces on both temples a little further back. In this way, under the reflection of strong light, the fat face becomes thin, and the thin face seems a little fatter. Also, for long faces, you can attach the forehead piece a little lower. For short faces, then move the forehead piece up a little. Unless your face is so fat or thin that it is out of shape, it can be made more beautiful, because this "applying the pieces" is a very important step in Peking Opera makeup, so I will briefly introduce it to you.

### Simple Beauty Techniques

— Qiu Ping

Loving beauty is human nature, and there are many ways to achieve beauty. If you seek simple, easy-to-do, and truly beneficial methods, then it's all about maintaining the complexion to prevent premature aging, thus preserving youthfulness, and maintaining oral hygiene to prevent tooth loss, ensuring bright, clean teeth perfect for smiles and frowns. Both of these require daily attention to effectively preserve your looks and make you beautifully charming. Here, I will discuss how to maintain your complexion and how to practice oral hygiene, providing these tips for beauty-conscious ladies to consider.

The complexion, without protection from the weather, wind, rain, sun, and frost for extended periods, will naturally age easily. Physiologically speaking, the skin's inner layers are delicate and constantly undergoing metabolism. If the function of expelling the old and generating the new is weak, the old cannot be pushed out, and the new cannot be generated. Thus, the surface layer of the skin hardens, leading to wrinkles. This is a sign of aging and the appearance of "chicken skin" and "crane hair." Understanding this, the fundamental solution is to take care of the skin in time. The first condition is to choose a nourishing cream to apply to the face daily. This protects against the elements and absorbs secretions from pores, boosting biological activity, making new cells lively and healthy, and pushing out dead cells. In this way, the work of maintaining the complexion is complete. So, the truth is, it is very simple. However, with so many creams on the market, which one has the most nourishing ingredients? From my personal experience, I would recommend the well-known and popular Wudi Brand Butterfly Cream, which effectively softens the skin and removes blemishes. I have been using it for a long time, and it truly meets my ideal requirements for a beauty cream. Therefore, I dare to introduce it to the readers.

"A beautiful woman, her teeth are bright and white," we can see from this line of poetry that teeth are inseparable from beauty, and teeth greatly impact the health of the body. Now, valuing healthy beauty, if one wants to pursue health, the first step is to start with cleaning the mouth. According to the experience of many dentists, many people with dental problems come for treatment. Although they are cured with reasonable treatment, they have already suffered greatly. Even if cured, nothing is better than natural teeth. Investigating the cause of the disease, it is often due to a lack of proper oral hygiene. "In stagnant water, insects breed," if teeth are never clean, dental diseases arise. At the same time, yellow and greasy teeth repel others, which is a key obstacle to beauty and health. To correct this problem, one must immediately use the renowned Wudi Brand Wudi Toothpaste, also known as Calcium Crystal Toothpaste. I used to be accustomed to foreign toothpaste. After a friend introduced me to Wudi Toothpaste, I felt as though I had discovered it too late. Because Wudi Toothpaste has a different style and taste, you feel a different kind of pleasure when rinsing. Seeking among domestic products, there is truly nothing comparable. Even among foreign products, it is not much inferior. This is my personal experience, and I dare to publish it in the newspaper. I urge those who love using expensive foreign toothpaste to try Wudi Toothpaste. You will definitely prove that my sentiments are not exaggerated. At the same time, promoting domestic goods and reducing trade deficits year by year is also our inherent duty.

### Talking About Jadeite

— Miaoren'er

Shanghai Jadeite Company is run by three giants in the jewelry industry: Lu Junren, Chen Huiquan, and Wu Ruisheng. Yesterday, while passing by Jing'an Temple Road, I took the opportunity to visit and had a long chat with Mr. Cheng Fusen. He told me about various aspects of jadeite, and I will briefly describe them below, according to my memory:

Jadeite is a type of jade that is produced in the deep mountains on the border of Yunnan in our country and British Burma. The most valuable is the transparent and bright green variety. It is hard and solid, impervious to knives, and does not melt in fire. There are many types, with varying degrees of quality, and only those experienced in this field can distinguish them. It has been circulating in our country for a long time but became popular during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Since then, it has been fashionable, and royal nobles felt inadequate without it. Now, its jewelry dominates countries around the world, which can be attributed to the promotion of the Qing Dynasty.

The polishing of jadeite relies entirely on manual labor, which cannot be achieved by machinery. Therefore, the techniques of the past centuries still reign supreme in the art world, and it is no coincidence that people both in China and abroad admire it. I recall last spring when the Da Xin Company held a jade art exhibition. Although the ticket price was as high as one yuan, visitors still flocked to it, and the venue could not accommodate them. I heard that the iron gate was pulled down several times a day, and Da Xin Company even made an exception to remain open on Sunday mornings as usual. Among the exhibits, there was a nine-lion round furnace, exquisitely carved and lifelike. Mr. Wu Tiecheng visited the exhibition and was amazed, saying that with this art, the national glory could be restored. His words were like that, enough to prove the preciousness, because the color and brilliance cannot be fully depicted by artists. Even modern color photography struggles to capture its likeness. Jadeite has its own precious light, dazzling and captivating, beyond human reach.

The preciousness of jadeite is as described above. Therefore, counterfeiting is rampant. Those commonly seen in the market include "burned materials," "fried colors," and "XX country jadeite." "Burned materials" use raw materials similar to glass, mixed with green color, and fired. However, they contain small bubbles, and the luster is by no means as bright and dazzling as genuine jadeite, making it easy to distinguish genuine from fake. "Fried colors" use white jadeite (commonly called "ground base") fried with emerald green material, hence the name. Because the materials are the same, it is more difficult to distinguish. However, when placed on fire and smoked, the color fades. As for "XX country jadeite," both its quality and color can deceive outsiders. However, it often has many black spots, and the color is yellowish. At first glance, it looks quite like jasper. When viewed under lamplight, the color is greatly reduced.

Jadeite businesses originally adhered to established practices, closing themselves off. In recent years, they have begun to seek external development. On one hand, they are rectifying industry regulations and striving for innovation, thus having the opportunity to come into contact with the outside world. Therefore, following the Da Xin Company jade art exhibition, there was a special handicrafts jewelry exhibition hall at the Municipal Government's Tenth Anniversary Exhibition. The exhibits were dazzling and unprecedented. Unfortunately, the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, and the situation suddenly became tense. The exhibition was announced to be over before it could conclude, and the public missed out on seeing it, which is deeply regrettable.

Jadeite has participated in foreign competitions twice: once at the 1926 Panama Canal Philadelphia Expo and once at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair. Both times, it won awards and accolades, bringing honor to the country.

With the war shifting west, Shanghai's special circumstances have led to the abnormal development of various industries. The number of newly opened businesses in this industry can reach dozens. However, due to the lack of raw materials, prices have soared, yet buyers still flock to them, almost creating a situation of supply falling short of demand, truly the golden age of this industry.

### New Trends in the Manufacture of Cosmetics

The creation of cosmetics by the Sino-French Pharmacy dates back to the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty. At that time, there were very few domestic manufacturers using chemical methods to produce cosmetics, making them rare and valuable. For a time, the produced Liren Brand Hair Tonic, Violet Hair Oil, Luo Wei Fragrant Powder, and Sanmei Brand Cologne, and other products were popular throughout the country, earning great praise and being hailed as the leading company in the cosmetics industry. Some even mistakenly thought that the Sino-French Pharmacy specialized in selling cosmetics, and foreign merchants took notice, leading to several lawsuits. The reputation of the products became even more well-known. In 1925, the Da Xi Road Pharmaceutical Factory was established, making the equipment for manufacturing cosmetics even more perfect. Successive famous cosmetics that have been in circulation include Baby Face Cream, Double Lion Brand Cologne, White Rose Hair Oil, Fairy Fragrant Powder, etc., totaling more than sixty varieties. The selection of materials is rigorous, and the refining is exquisite, no less than imported products, and the prices are low and economical, especially praised by society. However, the pharmacy still feels that it is not enough and strives to improve. The goal of manufacturing cosmetics is not only for beauty but also to consider the function of treating diseases. The latest product, Vitamin E, exemplifies this principle. It has been shown to be effective in eliminating spots and moles. Future products will be manufactured following this new trend, and groundbreaking contributions will be made soon. I will make a preliminary announcement and list some of the cosmetics that have already been released: ——

Moisturizers: Baby Face, White Jade Essence, Sanmei Brand Cream, Blue Bottle Fragrant Cream, etc.

Hair Tonics: Star Hair Tonic, Liren Brand Hair Tonic, Swan Hair Tonic, etc. (eight types)

Hair Oils: Sanmei Brand Hair Oil, White Rose Hair Oil, Purple Orchid Hair Oil, etc. (five types)

Hair Conditioners: Hairdressing Cream, Fragrant Vaseline, etc.

Fragrant Powders: Fairy Fragrant Powder, Luo Wei Sandalwood Powder, Soft Face Fragrant Face Powder, etc. (eight types)

Powders: Swan Brand Powder, Luo Wei Refreshing Body Powder, etc.

Toothpastes, Liquids: Elephant Brand Toothpaste, Star Toothpaste, Double Child Toothpaste, Solid Tooth Freshening Liquid, etc. (eleven types)

Fragrant Honeys: Luo Wei Ten Scenic Fragrant Honeys, Almond Blossom Honey, Honey Fragrance Water, etc. (eleven types)

Colognes: Double Lion Brand Cologne, Sanmei Brand Cologne, etc. (five types)

Miscellaneous: Fragrant Makeup Hair Lotion, Luo Wei Fragrant Juice, Rose Rouge Water, Clear Face Fragrant Water, Perfume Essence, etc.

### Cosmetics Industry and Ya Shuang in the Past Twenty-Five Years

— Ye Jun

Humans have a fondness for beauty, just like their taste for food. Mencius said, "Eating and sex are human nature." In the past, there was a Taoist in the deep mountains whose son had never been close to women in his life. Once, he took him to the market, where he saw a beautiful woman, and his heart secretly yearned for her. When he returned, he was languid as if seriously ill. The father knew and tricked him, saying, "This is a man-eating tiger." The son said, "I would rather be eaten by her without complaint." Another day, he went to the market again and passed a ragged, plain woman with an unadorned face, then he suddenly realized and continued his father's path and finished his career. Therefore, beautiful and elegant appearances can make people admire, and ugly and unadorned appearances can make people disgusted, even children know this. China has had cosmetics since historical figures such as Bao Si, Da Ji, Xi Shi, Zhaojun, Pan An, and Song Yu. To this day, all beautiful people rely on the magic of makeup. The magic of makeup relies especially on the tools of makeup. Therefore, lead white and vermilion red, musk dense and orchid subtle, oily fat and cleansing soap (this soap is the fruit of a plant), are the cosmetics of thousands of years ago, which we can learn from between the lines when reading history. Today, with the development of science, the tools of makeup, in the past twenty-five years, due to the invention of Ya Shuang, have opened a new record of domestic beauty products, not only replacing foreign goods, but also becoming a guide for today's cosmetics industry. At that time, foreign XX creams and XX lotions were extremely popular. After Ya Shuang came out, they also paled in comparison, gradually appearing clumsy.

Ya Shuang is a chemical compound that is derived from fat, but without the greasiness of fat, and takes from soap, but without the harshness of soap. Added with honey and mixed with medicine, its unique fragrance has a unique effect. No identical substance can be found in the corner of East Asia, those who know can say it. Therefore, its effectiveness in cleansing the skin, whitening the skin, moisturizing the skin's cells, and nourishing the local tissues is not an empty word. Now try to express it with a chemical formula:

For a product to gain a foothold in society, it must have its own unique strengths. The strength of Ya Shuang lies not only in the good formula combination but also in the strict selection of materials. People generally think that fatty acids (ie, stearin) combined with alkalinity form a paste-like moisturizer. Little do they know that there are more than ten types of fatty acids, the most common being 127 to 129 degrees, then 129 to 131 degrees, and the best being 131 to 133 degrees. The fatty acids used in Ya Shuang have a strength of over 133 degrees, so the price is also doubled. The second is alkaline substances. Alkaline substances, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, ammonia water, and ammonia compounds, can all have affinity with fatty acids and make snow creams. However, too much will cause harsh pain, and too little will cause oil separation. This combination must be carefully studied to make a perfect beauty product. Foreign honey can moisturize the skin, and boric acid can kill bacteria, all used in appropriate amounts in Ya Shuang products. Alcohol can stimulate the skin and cause local tissues to age over time, so Ya Shuang has tried its best not to use it. There is a way to distinguish this: if crystalline iridescent light is found in snow cream preparations, it is clear evidence that it contains a lot of alcohol.

Now is the 25th anniversary of Ya Shuang's release, and Shen Bao is soliciting articles for a special cosmetics issue from Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen modestly asked me to do it for him. I said that Ya Shuang's old friend is actually Shen Bao. In the early days of its release, Shen Bao's full-page advertisements gave great help to Ya Shuang's development. Now Shen Bao has been re-published for only a few months, and the number of advertisements and subscriptions are advancing in tandem. The future hope is to be comparable to the Times of London, which is what I look forward to.

### Scientific Makeup Art

— Jing

In the past many years, cosmetics were dominated by foreign products across the country, and the prices were quite high. However, foreign cosmetics are only suitable for the skin of foreigners. It is important to know that the skin of Chinese people is clearly different from that of foreigners. Therefore, even if you use expensive cosmetics to make up, the result always feels unsatisfactory. However, every year millions of dollars were spent. In view of this, Mr. Sun Yucheng, a well-known figure in the medical community, made a special effort to conduct in-depth research, using his medical experience and experiments to invent a cosmetics that was sensational and surpassed foreign products, namely the world-renowned "Mirror Cream". This Mirror Cream uses the best snow cream raw materials as a base, and adds special effects medicines for removing freckles, acne, wrinkles, etc., all together, using scientific replication methods, to make a snow-like cream that is smooth, moist, white, tender, and delicate when applied to the face. And because of the action of the medicine, it can make the skin cells lively, and the stubborn melanin (ie, freckles) gradually fades away. It can indeed eliminate the shortcomings of the face unconsciously and invisibly. Therefore, since its invention, it has won twelve points of praise from all walks of life, and is regarded as the supreme product in cosmetics. Recently, I heard that a "Beauty Mirror Cream" has been invented, which is more delicate in quality and fragrant in taste than ordinary cosmetics, making it lovable. The medicine-containing name is called "Special Mirror Cream", which can treat the above-mentioned facial freckles, acne and other symptoms. It is truly the leading panacea. Those who want to get real super cosmetics, please pay attention to three points!

### Night Fragrance

— Lai

Xian Meng Factory specializes in the production of high-end cosmetics, founded in 1931, with a capital of 50,000 national currency, completely operated by Chinese people, Chinese technicians, and most of the raw materials are French goods, and some are German and domestic. The products that have been produced include "Night Fragrance Perfume", "Gu Ben Cream", and "Xian Meng Mei Hair Acid". The products that are being planned include "Night Fragrance Cologne", "Night Fragrance Powder", lipstick, rouge, etc. The factory's products have always been exclusively managed by Shanghai Hua De Hang, and have always been sold to foreign countries. The total annual sales amount reaches more than 100,000 yuan. In recent years, it has also been seeking development in this city. Among them, "Night Fragrance Perfume" is especially popular with women from all walks of life in this city. The future is booming and is only a leader in domestic products.

### The Real Beauty Techniques of Film Star Clara Bow

— Junmei

More than ten years ago, Clara Bow used to enchant countless young men and women on the silver screen. Although she now seems to have disappeared, her beauty techniques are still deeply imprinted in the minds of every film star.

Clara Bow concentrated all the modern woman's seductive powers and hypnotic qualities, strongly expressing her ardent and sincere passion as the common lover of men on the screen. Therefore, she succeeded in becoming a wonderfully beautiful flower in the film circle. Her fragrant and passionate charm deeply stimulated the hearts of men and even women. At that time, she was praised around the world as the "Hot Girl" and the "Empress of Modern Women".

However, when she first decided to become a film actress, her failure was extremely tragic. Although she was born in the city, grew up in the city, liked sports, swimming, riding, and playing tennis, her nature was very unrestrained and uninhibited. Therefore, although her age was still that of a blossoming girl, her face was old and loose, and the director finally had to say a few sarcastic words to her, causing her to sob, tears sparkling, which was captured in the lens. As a result, all the films she performed were cut. After this attempt at failure, it made her realize that she had really neglected beauty and the truly valuable youthful appearance of a girl. Therefore, in addition to exercise every day, she went out early in the morning, naked, facing the California sun; took a sunbath for more than half an hour, and before going to bed, she vigorously rubbed her face with juice soaked in apples and buckwheat in strong wine. In this way, her face gradually became plump, and the aging and loose skin soon showed a smooth and delicate luster. When she was invited to direct a play by Alma McAvoy for the second time, the result of the test screening was surprisingly satisfactory. Since then, she has been moving step by step in the film circle. In 1926, she starred in "Hot" written by American female writer Elina Glyn. Her beauty and enthusiastic name almost made her fly to the sky.

Now, more than half of the Hollywood stars are still faithfully using Clara Bow's beauty techniques to conceal their fleeting youth. Therefore, the term "Hot Girl" seems to have become a thing of the past, and what Hot Girl often said to fans at the time: "My beauty is not makeup, and my success is naturally not the director, but what I am grateful for is only the sun, apples, and wine." It has almost become the supreme truth of beauty.

### Four Beauty Methods

— Lu Wenbiao

A beautiful face is often half natural, but artificial modifications can also help a lot. If the ancient beauties Xi Shi and Wang Zhaojun could be born today and use modern beauty techniques to make up, then I don’t know how much more beautiful they would be. The author will now introduce several basic beauty methods to beauty-loving ladies:

1. Hair Removal Method

The first step in beauty is to remove the hair on the face, because hair has a great hindrance to the appearance. Spread on the face, after the application, if the wax is not very hot at this time, you can use a blade to apply the wax to the face (one-tenth of a centimeter of the original). Then take a cold towel and cover it on the face to help the wax solidify. After a while, you can use a very quick operation to tear off the solidified wax skin, and the hair will be pulled off together without much pain.

There is another separate method to remove hair, which is to use electrology, but this work cannot be done at home and is much more expensive than using wax.

Many women use tweezers to pull out the hair one by one. This method is very bad, because it is time-consuming and harmful to the skin. The best method is to buy a special wax for hair removal at the pharmacy (you must buy a reliable brand, white wax is also acceptable). Put the wax in a clean small pot and simmer it over a low heat to make the wax gradually dissolve. When dissolving, use a blade to stir it until the wax is completely dissolved, then remove the pot from the fire and let the wax gradually cool down. Then take a piece of medical cotton, soak it in mica powder and apply it.

2. Facial Cleansing Method

If you want to make your face beautiful, relying solely on grease is not enough. The fundamental method is to nourish the skin and make it smooth and delicate. The most scientific method to nourish the skin is to take some yam flour, put it in a teacup, add two tablespoons of fragrant water, and mix it into a slurry. Then lie down on the bed and apply the yam flour slurry all over the face and neck. After application, wait quietly for half an hour to an hour, and then wash off the powder with boiling water. The face will be very radiant. If you feel that your skin is very dry and lacks fat, then you should use egg white instead of yam flour and apply it to the face. The method is exactly the same, and the effect is also very good. Hollywood stars in the United States love to use this beauty method.

3. Powdering Method

Before applying powder, you must first apply face cream, and then apply face powder. There are many types and colors of face powder. You must choose good ones to use, otherwise it will hurt the skin. When going to bed at night, you must wash off the grease completely. It is best to use medical cotton dipped in water to gently wipe the face, because sleeping with grease on is like sleeping in shoes, socks and outerwear, which is certainly uncomfortable.

4. Lip Tinting Method

The beauty of the lips has a great relationship with the appearance, so lip tinting is not just about applying a similar color to the lips. You must first study your own lips and determine the application method based on how they look. For example, if the corners of the lips are sinking downwards, you should apply some color upwards, but never apply the color to the corners of the lips. If the lips are larger, you only need to add a little color between the two lips. There are many colors used for lip tinting, including dark red, light red, coral color, etc. Dark red looks like blood and is only suitable for naturally beautiful lips. Ordinary people should use light red or coral color, which is more appropriate. If you are attending an evening banquet, because of the lighting, the color applied to the lips will not be obvious. Apply another layer of Indian gum on the color to make it more bright and radiant.

5. Eye Beauty Method

The beauty of the eyes lies in the agility and vitality of the eyeballs. To achieve this goal, you only need to get up every morning and rotate your eyeballs up, down, left, and right in a relatively open area. At the same time, gently tap your forehead with both index fingers to activate the blood. Practicing this for a few minutes will greatly help the beauty of the eyes.

### Concerning Perfume

— Xin Liang

Many girls will probably receive one or two bottles of perfume from their boyfriends or husbands during Christmas or New Year's! But did you know that this perfume manufacturing industry, in the United States alone last year, had a total trade value exceeding 200 million US dollars? Beauty salons in America, numbering 50,000, earned more than 100 million dollars! In Grasse, the world-renowned center of the French perfume industry, 7,500 tons of fresh flowers are supplied annually.

A woman who is already beautiful will naturally become even more charming with a few drops of perfume essence. Next, let me talk about everything about perfume.

Twelve years ago, a group of scientists discovered countless beautiful, engraved calcite bottles in the tomb of King Tutankhamun in the Nile River valley of Egypt. Once the bottle caps were opened, a strange fragrance immediately rushed out from the bottles. Egypt was originally a nation that could not be conceded, and it is she who has given us perfume today.

Although there are no records of perfume and cosmetics in human history, we are certain that their stories, like those of humans, are ancient. From the oldest cultures of China, Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Rome, etc., it seems that making perfume was also a refined art.

Fifty years before the birth of Jesus, there was a queen named Cleopatra in Egypt. It would be impossible to fully record the materials she used for perfume and makeup throughout her life. It is said that at a grand banquet she held for Antony, she covered the floor of the palace with a two-foot-thick carpet of roses. Her eulogy after death read: "Let your nostrils always have fragrance, oh, noble queen! Let lotus flowers always be in your throat."

In the past, Chinese women used "wood shaving water" to brighten their hair, and it is rumored that they also put some fragrant powder inside their "lotus shoes." Centuries ago, Chinese women already had colorful paintings on their fingers.

During banquets in the ancient Roman Empire, spices were also added to the wine. Queen Elizabeth even had a special room dedicated to making perfume for her personal use!

But from ancient times to the present, there have been countless people who opposed this cosmetic. During the heyday of Florence, a monk named Savonarola once said to many women, "Sisters of Florence—sin, laziness, vanity—I will call you to destroy all the spices of the East."

At that time, one woman immediately stood up and ran into the street; the others followed, and soon the center of the street was piled high with powders, perfumes, and other cosmetic items. People in other cities were also infected by this madness, and a fire was set to burn a large number of beauty items; strangely, this fire burned for several days before it was extinguished.

Later, things changed, and that monk was eventually burned to death for his unrestrained words.

During the Victorian era, there were also people who opposed the use of powder and lipstick. Later, during the Crusades, many nobles and knights brought countless precious perfumes from the East to Europe; this laid the foundation for subsequent East-West trade and further influenced the Renaissance and Columbus's discovery of the New World in 1492.

Queen Catherine of France during the reign of Henry II was also a woman who loved perfume. She had a person named Chanat who was specially dedicated to making perfume for her.

Chanat was able to make perfume into a kind of poison, so that anyone who put on gloves sprinkled with this poison would die silently—this secret recipe was not passed down.

This queen also mixed all the spring water in Paris with perfume. Grasse, the center of the French perfume industry, is said to have been founded by her as well.

There, you will see countless roses, violets, and orange trees planted. Grasse supplies the world with 7,500 tons of fresh flowers every year to make perfume for women to spray!

The fragrance extracted from the flowers still needs to be combined with other fragrances. Good and bad scents blend together to produce the fragrance and richness of perfume. A popular perfume is said to be a mixture of seventeen different scents. Among them, musk is the most precious. Finally, the perfume must be diluted with alcohol; if it is too strong, it will be pungent; if it is too weak, its fragrance will not last.

In the past, we only had two hundred kinds of fragrances, but now there are at least a thousand. Many of them are made by combining various ingredients.

Perfume is no longer a luxury in modern times. The manufacture of leather, insecticide powder, oilcloth, paint, various fabrics, ink, and medicine relies on it to remove unpleasant odors. Now, some scientists have even created a fragrant gasoline, which is used to spray into the air to remove the turbidity within!

From this, we should know the importance of perfume!

### Talking about Cosmetics

— Hen Shi

Aesthetic concepts are based on human nature, especially among women. Even if someone is as ugly as Wu Yan, if praised, they will be sincerely happy, considering it the greatest fortune. However, if criticized, they will invariably bristle with anger, harboring resentment to the bone. Therefore, all humans love beauty. However, the word "beauty" has no fixed definition. What constitutes beauty must depend on individual goals, and the fashions of different eras also vary. Therefore, beauty of the face is difficult to define definitively. In past eras, artificial beautification techniques were very primitive and lacked medical knowledge. Cosmetics were limited to face powder, but face powder was rich in lead, which not only did not benefit the skin, but also, after prolonged absorption by the pores, caused changes in the fine cell structure of the skin, and the metabolic function gradually declined. Once the face powder was washed off, the skin's pigmentation became dull and lifeless. Therefore, artificial beautification techniques in the past not only failed to exert their beautifying effects but also hindered health. Since the enlightenment of science, the advancement of medicine, all beautification methods have been changing with each passing day. Regardless of gender, if there are defects or obstacles on the face that cannot be treated medically, artistic methods can be used to solve them. Taking vanishing cream as an example of cosmetics, its application procedures and contained ingredients are vastly superior to the face powder of past eras. The composition of vanishing cream mostly consists of a type of face powder and various aromatic substances mixed together. Its main raw materials are stearic acid, paraffin wax, olive oil, glycerin, and preservatives such as hydrogen peroxide and boric acid, which allow it to be stored for a long time without changing. The various other aromatic agents vary depending on the manufacturer or the needs of the times. Among the cosmetics on the market, the most expensive fragrance used, as far as the reporter knows, is Yashuang, produced by the Continental Pharmacy. Its main fragrance costs more than 240 yuan per pound in national currency, and it has an exclusive contract, enjoyed solely by that company, preventing others from ordering it. Therefore, for twenty years, it has held a unique position in the cosmetics industry.

The first vanishing cream to be launched on the Chinese market was Hazeline Snow. At that time, transportation was inconvenient, and newspaper advertisements were rarely used to promote it. Only commercial ports could see this silvery-white beauty product. Inner chambers in the mainland had virtually none. Later, Baiyushuang rose to prominence, sparing no effort in its promotion, becoming popular almost nationwide, while the domestic cosmetic Yashuang took the opportunity to rise up and contend with foreign goods. Yashuang's quality and fragrance are indeed among the best of domestic products, but its fragrance, after prolonged storage, changes color, which is its only flaw. Its medical efficacy can prevent wrinkles and remove all spots because dust flies in the air and, if it sticks between the skin tissues, combines with the fat and sweat secreted under the skin, it turns black, or from strong sunlight. Sunburn or frostbite, if treated with Yashuang, can all be protected. To use it, first apply Yashuang to the fingertips, use two thumbs, place it on the cheekbones, then use two index fingers, lightly rubbing the eyelids of both eyes. Repeat this several times, and you can also rub the face or arms in the same way, so that the muscles in each part are highly developed, which can prevent wrinkles; but you must persevere for a long time to be effective. Muscular fibers in anatomical science, unless rubbed, cannot promote metabolism, and unless you use Yashuang, you cannot stimulate the absorption power of pores. As for sunburn or frostbite, apply Yashuang before each face wash, then cover with a hot towel for about three minutes, and then wash off the Yashuang with warm water. After washing your face, apply it again, and you will surely be able to restore your original condition.

Yashuang's medical efficacy is as described above, so its sales have increased year by year, from south to north, and it is highly trusted by society. Yashuang has contributed to the disappearance of the belief in the ability of foreign goods.

Simultaneously launched with Continental Yashuang was Xuehua from Guang Sheng Hang. Its quality and fragrance are also of the highest quality, but its volume is smaller, and it is popular in the southern region. It is not as prevalent in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In recent years, it has been the era of the rise of vanishing creams. Products such as Die Shuang from the Home Industry Cooperative, Ai de Shuang from the Oriental Industry Cooperative, Wuzhou Beauty Cream, Continental Beauty Cream, Zhongfa Haier Mian, and Baichang Mian You can be seen everywhere in newspapers. Among them, both good and bad can be seen, and each has its own strengths. New products this year are emerging like bamboo shoots after rain, such as Yonghe's Rongyou, Tongren's Mianli, Taiping's Tongzhi Cream, Baijia's Doukou, and Meihua's Zhuguang Cream. There are countless others that have not been seen in newspapers and are sold on consignment to various foreign goods stores. This is because manufacturing is simple, requires no large capital, and bottles of materials can be purchased everywhere, but whether the combination meets medical principles can only be known after testing.

### The Past and Present of Mianli

— Pharmacist Zhu Qiuyuan

The wheel of time is rapidly advancing, and all material enjoyment is naturally changing with the times. Let's talk about cosmetics. In the past, people only knew how to apply rouge and powder, seeking temporary whiteness and temporary beauty. However, no one paid attention to whether this powder could improve beauty after use. From this perspective, rouge and powder are ultimately decorative items, which offer no benefit to the skin. It's simply like painting a wall, resulting in a rough, white, and gray face that cannot be without it for a single day. This is the evil of inferior rouge and powder. However, in today's age of scientific development, the medical community has also felt the great shortcomings in the extensive use of beauty products and is beginning to improve them. "Mianli" is a newly emerging scientific beauty product in recent years and is also a cosmetic with medical properties. We know that women cannot avoid applying powder, and we also know what women deeply hate and resent: blemishes, acne, and other disfiguring conditions. Therefore, based on these two points, "Mianli" improved vanishing powder, using purely medical principles to formulate it. "Mianli" not only nourishes the skin, preserving the beauty of youth, but also eliminates the biggest obstacles to beauty: blemishes and acne. Vanishing powder is a compound of stearic acid and alkali, with some glycerin inside. Its ability is limited to moisturizing at most, to be used as a powder base. After applying it, you still have to apply dry powder. Using it is very troublesome and also very uneconomical. "Mianli" combines this fragrant powder and vanishing cream into one, considering the chemical aspects several times before adding various medicinal powders for beautifying and removing blemishes inside. When applied to the face, it has the wonderful effect of lightly applying powder with a graceful appearance. However, one thing needs to be clarified: the powder contained in "Mianli" is absolutely not a type of lead-based fragrant powder but is a medicinal powder that is absolutely beneficial to the skin. Therefore, the results have been very satisfactory. In these fleeting four or five years, we have continuously received hundreds of thank-you letters from ladies from all walks of life after curing blemishes and acne. We deeply feel that this glorious harvest makes our painstaking research worthwhile. At the same time, it has uniquely opened a new chapter in cosmetics, occupying a position of its own. "Mianli" has been issued a drug permit No. 128 by the Central Health Administration. It seems that no cosmetic has yet obtained such a certificate. "Mianli" previously had three types of fragrances: A, B, and C. Recently, we have specially created fragrance D. This is a very valuable type of fragrance, indeed more fragrant than others, quiet and lovely. We firmly believe that it will definitely win the universal sympathy of ladies from all walks of life. Done, I wish everyone a Happy New Year.

### The Responsibility of Beauty Products

— Ling Naiping

The love of beauty is inherent in human nature. According to historical records, Zhang Chang had the joy of painting eyebrows, and He Yan excelled at applying powder. Just like the jade-like beauties of the North and the flowery beauties of the South, the origins of beauty products have been respected in our country since ancient times. It is a pity that the material enjoyment of that time cannot be compared with the enjoyment of the current scientific era. At this time, when beauty products permeate the times and flood the market, with countless shapes and colors, beauty-loving ladies must pay attention to the selection of beauty products as good companions for their dressing tables and fine products for modification. The manufacturers of beauty products must not forget the responsibility they should bear when manufacturing beauty products. Do not specialize in using the novel publicity methods that resonate all day long, and use inferior products to deceive the world for profit. You must focus on formulation and efficacy to not betray the responsibility of manufacturing beauty products. In this way, beauty lovers have something to love, things are put to practical use, and producers are welcomed, complementing each other.

People are born with different shapes and postures. Some are delicate and beautiful, and some have a healthy and beautiful appearance. To maintain their beautiful faces forever and not age due to the invasion of climate, dust, and years, or even to transform ugliness into beauty and change roughness and darkness into fairness, the application of era-specific beauty products is essential for success, so as to enhance beauty and preserve youth forever. As far as the author knows, Fubeikang Cosmetics Unlimited Company has a long history and has always been a representative of the production of era beauty products with forward-thinking and scientific approaches. Its most famous and precious product—"Haoyou," a special effect whitening and blemish-removing agent—can indeed transform old tissues in the skin and eliminate all obstacles to beauty. It has long been loved by tens of millions of ladies. The company's other famous products, such as Baique Xiangfen, Baique Rouge, Fubeikang Flower Dew Perfume, Fubeikang Hair Cream, Hair Gel, Tianxin Perfume, etc., number no less than dozens of types, all exquisitely beautiful and popular everywhere, truly a long-established Angel of Beauty, extraordinary.

"Shenbao Beauty Edition" is a special publication for studying and solving beauty problems. I hope that all beauty-loving ladies in the world will have the beauty of Pan An and the loveliness of Xi Shi.

### Ai De Shuang

— Ai

Ai De Shuang, produced by Oriental Chemical Industry Cooperative, is made according to beauty principles and using scientific methods, in three grades: first, second, and third. It has the functions of cleaning the skin and nourishing cells, with the richest beauty effects. Therefore, since its sale, it has been welcomed by beauty-loving ladies.

### Tongzhi Cream

— Zhi

People who have freckles on their faces are often troubled by the lack of products to cure them. Although there are many methods for treating freckles on the market, they are all promotional in nature. It is now heard that Tongzhi Cream and Yangmian Ye, two kinds of beauty products produced by the Taiping Pharmacy on Weihaiwei Road, are specialized in treating freckles, rosacea, oily skin, etc., and have a proven effect, with sales reaching more than twenty years. They can be called wonderful products.

### Zhong Lingxiu Talks About the Nationwide Implementation of Remedial Education for Out-of-School People, Achieving Results Twice as Good as the Total of the Previous Eight Years; The Lack of Teachers Should be Addressed by Quickly Establishing Teacher Training Institutions; It is Hoped that Everyone Will Work Together to Promote Remedial Education for the War of Resistance and National Construction

(Chongqing Correspondence) Zhong Lingxiu, the section chief in charge of people's education at the Social Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, recently discussed the main points of the Ministry of Education's handling of remedial education for out-of-school people and improvements in great detail, as follows:

Since the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of Measures for People's Schools in the 17th year of the Republic of China, up to the 24th year, the total number of people who have received education in people's schools in various provinces and cities during these eight years is only over 8 million, averaging about 1 million people per year. Since the promulgation and implementation of the Outline of Measures for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People in the 25th year, aiming to eliminate illiteracy nationwide within six years, it was planned that 12 million people would receive education in the 25th year. However, the plans set by various provinces and cities have exceeded this number. The results of one year of effort in the 25th year have surpassed twice the total number of the previous eight years, with significant results. What is the reason for this? Tracing back to the source, it is due to the government's planned and targeted strict supervision, and the use of political power to implement a mandatory system is also an important key to achieving great results. However, since the implementation in various provinces and cities, there are still many difficulties. To summarize, there are approximately: 1. Difficulty in raising funds; 2. Lack of talent. The education funds of various provinces and cities are not very sufficient to begin with. Free education is being promoted, and people's education must also be planned and considered. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to raise additional funds. The Ministry of Education has provided substantial subsidies for free education funds, so requesting subsidies for people's education funds is also a matter of course. However, the central people's education funds are actually limited, which leads to requests from various provinces and cities that often amount to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. Although the Ministry of Education provides slight subsidies, the amount is ultimately limited. Dissatisfaction with the failure to obtain funds inevitably affects the progress of the work. However, various provinces and cities must pay special attention to the fact that the funds for out-of-school people should be based on local fundraising as a principle. In municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, the municipal government should coordinate the funds. In various provinces, regions, counties, and cities, the provincial and county governments should share the costs as a principle. On the central level, the Ministry of Education should consider the situation and provide separate subsidies, but various provinces and cities cannot completely or largely rely on the central government's subsidies without devising ways to raise funds themselves. Therefore, how to plan the sources of funds and stipulate the steps for gradual annual increases to meet urgent needs should be regarded as an important issue of the present by various provinces and cities, and effective solutions should be devised. It is found that since the large-scale implementation of remedial education for out-of-school people began in the 15th year, the required number of teachers could barely be met. However, since more than 40,000 teachers must be added annually thereafter, there will inevitably be a shortage of teachers. The difficulties are even greater in remote provinces. As a remedy, it is urgently necessary to establish teacher training institutions for people's schools extensively. Each administrative supervisory district should establish at least one institution for rapid training to avoid a shortage of teachers. In addition, there are two things that are closely related to remedial education for out-of-school people and can be mutually linked to handle: 1. Social military training (or militia training, people's training); 2. All levels of schools, agencies, and organizations should uniformly set up affiliated people's schools. According to the provisions of Article 2 of the Outline of Measures for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People, attention must be paid to self-defense training in addition to civic education and literacy education. Self-defense training is currently being actively carried out in all provinces across the country, with strict organization and rigorous discipline. In addition to military training, literacy education and civic education are also taught. The time is very economical, and teaching is easy to implement. There is no difficulty in retaining students, which is really convenient with half the effort and twice the result. It is hoped that the education authorities of various provinces will pay close attention to this. As for the measures for schools at all levels to concurrently handle social education, the Ministry of Education has already promulgated and implemented them. Remedial education for out-of-school people is the most essential education in the process of the War of Resistance and National Construction. School education should be socialized and should be quickly carried out concurrently in order to be universal. It is found that there are a total of 30,000 large, medium, and small schools across the country. Each school should concurrently run at least two classes, with 50 people in each class, and hold two sessions per year. Each school can teach at least 200 people per year. The total number of people who can receive education annually in schools at all levels across the country is 6 million. If the wartime people's school measures are followed, with each session lasting two months, each school can hold four additional sessions per year, and the number of people receiving education can be increased by another 6 million, totaling 12 million per year. Various agencies and organizations can also be set up in the same way, and the number of people receiving education can be increased by at least 2 million to 4 million annually. Combining items 1 and 2, the number of people receiving education can be increased by at least 8 million to 16 million annually. The effort required by schools at all levels, agencies, and organizations is minimal, but the benefits for the people are substantial. It is especially hoped that all aspects of society will work together and provide assistance to vigorously promote this. Now, at this critical moment of national crisis, this people's remedial education is an essential plan for the War of Resistance and National Construction. It is hoped that the education authorities of various provinces and cities will pay special attention to this, provide ample funds, train teachers, and work together with military training agencies. Schools at all levels, agencies, and organizations should uniformly set up affiliated schools and promote them annually to complete the great task of eradicating illiteracy nationwide and raising the cultural level of society within six years. It is also hoped that compatriots across the country will attach importance to this, directly and indirectly provide assistance, and promote its success.

### Senior Educationist Shen Jiyi Passes Away

Educator Shen Jiyi was one of the founders of private school reform. In the late years of the Qing Dynasty, during the Guangxu period, schools were not yet widespread. Mr. Shen, in view of the urgent need to improve the private school system, resolutely changed private schools to the school system. During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Shen founded the National Education Advancement Association and established Anding Primary School, with the aim of improving normal school talent. Primary school education is the foundation of national education. Mr. Shen traveled extensively to various provinces across the country to investigate the achievements of education in various places and the state of normal schools. He devoted his life to education for nearly forty years. In his later years, his energy gradually declined, but he still worked with Mr. Zhu Tingqi and others to establish rural primary schools in more than 30 townships in Pudong, and received the support of local gentry and merchants, with remarkable achievements. Although Mr. Shen was in his seventies, he still walked in the countryside, inspecting the conditions of various schools and lecturing on the meaning of the New Life Movement. His enthusiasm for education was like this. Recently, due to worrying about national affairs, he contracted heart failure and passed away on December 29th, at the age of seventy-one. The funeral was held yesterday at the Shanghai Funeral Home. The education community has lost a mentor, and everyone who heard the news mourned him.

### Shanghai Women's University Holds Anniversary Commemoration

Shanghai Women's University Women's Middle School and Women's Primary School on Xin Dagu Road in this city jointly held the 18th, 8th, and 6th anniversary commemorations yesterday. The ceremony was held in the morning, chaired by Chairman Lin Kanghou, who reported on the purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, school directors Qian Jianqiu, Lu Xirong, Huang Jingwan, guest Tang Guoli, Chen Jicheng, teacher representative Zhao Yi, etc., gave speeches. Student representatives from the large, medium, and small departments and student representatives from the street children's class sponsored by the school's student union delivered congratulatory speeches and presented gifts. Finally, Principal Dr. Wu Zhi delivered a speech and dismissed the meeting. In the afternoon, there was a performance of recreational activities.

Overview of Education

### Difficult Children's School

After the sacred "August 13th" War of Resistance broke out, many boy and girl scouts in Shanghai went crazy to defend their motherland. Whether on the battlefield or in the rear, they presented their strength. This is the responsibility of every citizen, so they all embraced the determination to sacrifice for the motherland. Therefore, during the Songhu War of Resistance, they had many touching stories, which are of course still deeply imprinted in the minds of people in society.

Since the westward movement of the national army, these vast numbers of young scouts have either joined the army to gallop on the battlefield, or been displaced and lost on this desolate isolated island because their hometowns were ravaged by the brutal enemy. Therefore, the Shanghai Boy Scout Council established the Difficult Children's School to provide them with sustenance and education, and to cultivate talents for the motherland. At the same time, it has received economic assistance from the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charity Organizations in this city and the Refugee Relief Branch, so many displaced boy and girl scouts have continued to obtain educational opportunities.

The school has been established for almost a year. The principal is Zhao Weizu. Due to the school building, classes were held at the Taiping Bank on Tianjin Road last semester, and temporarily moved to the Zhirenyong Girls' School during the summer vacation. This semester, it has been relocated to Xu Garden on Connaught Road. Xu Garden was originally a famous private garden in Shanghai, but now it is a desolate place. They built a large reed shed in the ruins to serve as a place for teaching and raising them, and hundreds of orphans are buried in it to study hard. Under such circumstances, the school's teaching is, of course, extremely strict. The teachers of this semester include more than a dozen people such as Sun Yixin, Xia Huanxin, Xu Zhengyi, Xu Xi, Yang Lucun, and Xiao Zijie, all of whom are well-known figures in the education circles of this city. They are all willing to give spiritual help in a purely voluntary manner. The same is true for the staff.

The school originally had a high school department last semester. This semester, due to financial difficulties, there are only three junior high school grades, with a total of hundreds of students. There are also nearly ten girls. Their daily life is under strict scout management. They all wear national product blue cloth work clothes, with classes in the morning and skills in the afternoon. They take turns camping once a week. Extracurricular activities include organizations such as a singing team, Peking opera, drama, and calligraphy research society. Recently, in order to consider the students' future, the school plans to move towards vocational education, teaching students production skills. It has now established an advertising agency and plans to equip a printing department and other small workshops. It is currently being planned by experts, but the economic aspect is of course difficult. It is heard that social charities are hoped to provide assistance.

This semester, the school has deeply felt the joy and encouragement given to them by people in society with their sympathy and assistance. They are determined to work hard in the midst of economic hardship.

Five meters later, French Army Xie Qierji, Lidu Jia Zhang Liang, and Ling Xuewen followed closely behind. Wang Zhenglin, Guan Youwen, and Cao Shizhang were sworn brothers and strode forward. On Daxi Road, Guan Youwen rose to third place, and Wang Zhenglin followed closely behind. At Columbia Road, French Army Xie Qierji retreated again, and Zhenglin strode up and jumped to second place.

### Man-Wolf Fierce Battle

— Hercules

According to various sources: The entire world has been hit by a cold wave in the past few days. Whether in America, Europe, or the Far East, it is extremely cold. In Shanghai, due to the invasion of the Siberian high pressure, the north wind is biting and extremely cold.

Modern people, who have already lost the ability to resist the forces of nature, how can they withstand the sudden attack and invasion of the severe cold? Therefore, in winter, many poor people are frozen to death. This year is of course no exception. It has been heard in the United States, and there must be more in China. However, in Romania, a more tragic "man-wolf fierce battle" occurred:

"Due to the severe cold weather, mountain wolves had nowhere to eat, and yesterday they invaded the village of Brusturi in groups. The villagers each held knives, axes, hoes, and shovels, and fought fiercely with them for two hours. As a result, four villagers and fourteen wolves died." (Reuters, Rome, December 29)

Wolves are the most cruel animals. Their personality is greedy, fierce, and evil, and their behavior is cunning and dangerous. They not only devour small animals such as rabbits, deer, and birds, but also harm humans. However, they cannot jump out of the control circle of nature. The wolves in the mountainous area of Brusturi Village had to leave the place where they had "nowhere to eat" in order to survive, and broke into the village in an attempt to save their hunger. But they also knew the danger of this action, so they formed "groups." This may be said to be their "intelligence," but after all, they cannot defeat human wisdom. The people of Brusturi Village knew to use "unity" to deal with the "groups" of wolves, and to use "knives, axes, hoes, and shovels" to deal with the "poisonous teeth and sharp claws." Finally, they overcame the current difficulties and shattered the wolves' attempts.

This scene of "man-wolf fierce battle" lasted for as long as two hours. We can imagine the tension and fierceness of the struggle at that time. At the same time, based on the number of deaths of humans and wolves, we can also know the large number of people and wolves who participated in the fierce battle. Although the people of Brusturi Village did not win a complete victory in this fierce battle and also suffered considerable sacrifices, the price of this sacrifice was great. It not only defeated the invasion of man-eating wolves, but also showed that only the spirit of sacrifice as if facing death can protect the safety of the village and avoid the ravages of greedy wolves. In other words: If the people of Brusturi Village do not know how to endure pain and sacrifice when disaster is imminent, and only seek to close their doors for safety, then they will not be able to escape the devouring of greedy wolves, and its result will exceed the degree of pain at this time.

The value of this piece of gossip news may not be high in itself, but it can be used as a help from other mountains when Chinese compatriots who are struggling hard read it.

### National Calendar New Year in Shanghai

— New Dream

The New Year always has some New Year atmosphere, but although the National Calendar has been promulgated for many years, the atmosphere of the National Calendar New Year cannot match the Lunar New Year. It only gives the leisure class and the people who enjoy happiness one more opportunity to revel. There are two New Years in a year. The National Calendar New Year has not been long past, and there is also a Lunar New Year. I wonder when this custom will be broken?

Just talking about Shanghai, on the National Calendar New Year's Day, except for a few prosperous roads, some shops have their iron doors closed, with notes saying "New Year's Day Holiday for One Day" or "Three Days," and the blue sky and white sun flag is pulled to the top of the flagpole, fluttering in the wind. Everything else is the same as usual. If you meet a person with a lower level of knowledge or an ordinary worker and ask him what day it is today, he will definitely answer you without hesitation: "It is the foreign New Year's Day—" This New Year's Day is foreign and has nothing to do with the Chinese. Regarding this, we can see the difficulty of abolishing customs.

However, after eating lunch, if you walk on the street on New Year's Day, you can immediately see that movie theaters and Peking opera houses are doing particularly well. The "Full" sign is hung on the door, and the iron door is also closed tightly. Not being able to see a play with money will make you a little annoyed. But if you watch a movie, it doesn't matter. Buy a ticket for the next show and wait patiently at the iron gate. Although you will fully experience the taste of the northwest wind, you will definitely see it. Every amusement park is also full. Needless to say, the dance halls are lively at night. Isn't this full of the New Year's atmosphere? But it is only limited to the leisure class and the people who enjoy happiness. Isn't the labor sector still the same as usual, running around and working? The children are not like Lunar New Year's Day, putting on new clothes, and the mothers and sisters are also wearing everyday clothes. New clothes are reserved for showing off during the Lunar New Year.

What makes you feel particularly funny on the street is the people selling calendars and almanacs: "Want an old French new calendar book? Buy one for six coppers." Since it is a new calendar book, why add the words "old French"? It is contradictory and makes you laugh. Wasn't it forbidden to print the lunar calendar on the calendar a few years ago? However, now, which of the colorful calendars is not a combination of the lunar and solar calendars? Otherwise, there would be no customers. The facts tell us that the complete abolition of the lunar calendar will take a considerable amount of time.

However, to be fair, in our memory, since the establishment of the National Government, repeated orders have been issued, ordering the people to follow the National Calendar uniformly. There was a year when, under the strict orders of the Shanghai Municipal Government, all shops, large and small, in Nanshi and Zhabei were closed for three days starting from the National Calendar New Year's Day, and drums were beaten loudly, and spring couplets were pasted on the shop doors, and many firecrackers were set off. In the same year, all schools in Shanghai had classes as usual during the Lunar New Year. The Education Bureau sent people to investigate. If anyone was found to have taken a holiday without permission, they would be severely punished. But now, it has returned to the path of the waning of the yang and the waxing of the yin. In short, since the promulgation of the National Calendar, that New Year was the most celebrated!

New Year's Conclusion Sangzi

New is the opposite of old, so the establishment of the new must have its old object. If there is new without old as the object, and old without new for comparison, then the theory of being new or being old fundamentally loses its foundation. At the same time, the division between new and old cannot be observed from a historical perspective, but only has temporal and spatial relationships. For example, "New Year" in relation to "Old Year" is only a difference in years, and there is not much difference in social form. Moreover, we can often see that what is considered new here is exactly considered old there; what was considered old in the past may not necessarily be called new now. Therefore, being new as new depends entirely on adapting to the times and environment as the only condition.

"Pushing the old and bringing forth the new" is a natural phenomenon in society and also a natural trend in society. The Great Learning says: "Tang's inscription on his bath tub says: If you can make it new one day, renew it day after day, day after day." This is the principle of social evolution. If the evolution of general phenomena or forms lacks objective conditions and does not conform to the principles of social evolution, even if it is innovative, it only sees a difference, and as a result, it will inevitably lead to self-destruction and self-defeat. For example: the "new government" advertised by general "puppets" and Japan's advocacy of a "new order," let us put aside its causes and its content for the time being, even in terms of its form, it violates general political or international common sense. Its fate and its ending can be foreseen.

We firmly believe that all disguised newness will be shattered and collapsed before the spirit of the new China, the construction of the new China, and the military force of the new China that will grow in the scorched earth. The New Year has already told us: "It will be the conclusion that the trend will turn in favor of China."

### Fleeting Life Like a Dream

— Yan Hua

“You Can't Take it with You”

Columbia Pictures presents, Cathay Theatre screens

Frank Capra's initial work to garner global attention in the film industry was "It Happened One Night." Subsequently, he consistently produced films like "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and "Lost Horizon." "Fleeting Life Like a Dream" is Capra's latest work following "Lost Horizon." The original stage script won the Pulitzer Prize, and the screenwriter Robert Riskin is a well-known screenwriter at Columbia Pictures.

The entire film features over ten famous actors, including Edward Arnold, who plays a major entrepreneur in the banking world; Lionel Barrymore, who plays an elderly man in his twilight years enjoying retirement; Jean Arthur, who plays Lionel Barrymore's granddaughter and the lover of the banker's son; James Stewart, who plays Edward Arnold's son and Jean's lover; and Mischa Auer, who always plays comedic roles, as a Russian dance instructor.

The story is simple: an old man's granddaughter and a banker's son are deeply in love, but due to class differences, the old man's granddaughter leaves in shame and anger. As a result, the area where the old man lives is forced to be sold, causing another banker to go bankrupt and die. In the end, this banker, who possesses immense economic power, is moved by his son's departure and the death of the other banker, realizing the unreliability of his career. He abandons everything and goes to the old man's house to revel and make merry with everyone.

While sitting in the theater, the 120 minutes of the film (14 reels in total) deeply moved me. After watching the entire film, I have three thoughts:

First, the playwright's intentions are similar to those of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town." They both reject the current system of a money-driven society. They express anger and discontent towards skyscrapers and all luxurious material possessions. In "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," the protagonist gives his land and property to all the poor farmers; in "Fleeting Life Like a Dream," the banking entrepreneur abandons all his business and retires.

Second, we believe that the playwright's starting point is correct: he rejects the current money-driven society. However, his actions are flawed. He portrays the protagonists of both "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and "Fleeting Life Like a Dream" as individualists, which is the biggest mistake in both scripts.

Third, we absolutely reject the main theme of "Fleeting Life Like a Dream," which believes that "money is an external possession; you can't take it with you when you die," and then, like the banker, abandons his career. We believe that all public services that benefit the public should be done. If one exploits the public for personal gain, that should be condemned by the public. Such a view as in "Fleeting Life Like a Dream" only represents passive individualism.

However, the entire play is indeed exceptionally successful, especially in emotionally rich scenes. It can move people to tears. For example, in depicting the loveliness of human relationships, the director's skills are profound and easy to understand, outstanding and lively, truly worthy of being called a superior director. The contrast in the overall atmosphere of the film is very strong, which can be seen in the following scenes: When Banker Koppe defeats another banker and grasps the authority of the economic world, three methods are used to depict Koppe's loneliness and emotion: first, Koppe's staff urges him to attend a meeting; second, another bankrupt banker comes in and scolds Koppe, saying that he will become like him in the future (and then faints); third, Koppe's son comes in to say goodbye to his father. Koppe, with tears in his eyes, rushes out of the meeting... In the courtroom scene, the judge fines the old man 100 yuan. Everyone refuses Koppe's money and raises the money on the spot in the courtroom. Finally, Jean shouts loudly, Mrs. Koppe faints, and photographers rush in, creating chaos in the court... Finally, in the old man's house, Koppe joins their harmonica performance, and the crowd cheers and dances wildly... These three scenes are too exciting and powerful.

Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore have the most scenes and perform extremely successfully. Jean and Stewart are also very good.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes a Free Village; Twin Daughters Pay Respects at the Martyrs' Grave

Speaking of that school principal, he is already over sixty years old this year. He was originally a local villager. Because he had studied for several years, he opened a private school in a small town twenty years ago, enrolling twenty or thirty students. Among the students, some were fifteen or sixteen years old, and some were seven or eight years old. The ages were uneven, and the levels were also different. Fortunately, he taught everyone without discrimination. No matter which family's children wanted to study, he welcomed them all. Although it was a village school, it wasn't just "reciting 'Heaven, Earth, Xuan, Huang' for a year." He also used modern textbooks and imitated the classroom style of schools in the city. Behind the teacher, there was also a blackboard, and he often used chalk to explain new words to the students. However, the place was very simple. He borrowed a local temple and set up a few plank tables and benches, and that was it. He charged each person one dollar for tuition every six months, not including books and paper, which probably cost only twenty or thirty cents every six months. The rural families in that area were still diligent, and the land was fertile, so many children could afford to study. Therefore, almost all the children in that village were his students. However, he had a habit: every morning when he got up, he would go to the small teahouse in the town, where he would wash his face and brush his teeth. He would bring his own teapot and tea leaves, spending three copper coins for hot water every day, and he would drink until nine o'clock in the morning, when he would go to teach. At four o'clock in the afternoon, after school, he would go to the small teahouse again. Therefore, people called him "Teahouse Head." However, villagers relied on farming, and when it was time for the busy farming season, even the children had to help work in the fields. Even the children who couldn't do much work had to deliver meals and watch the cows. So, during this time, the village school teacher was free and spent all day in the small teahouse. Later, he came up with an idea: schools in the city had two vacations a year. One was called summer vacation, which was during the hot season; the other was called winter vacation, which was during the cold season. His school also had two vacations a year. One was called planting vacation, which was during the early summer. Moreover, many silk farmers in this village were also busiest at that time. The other was called harvest vacation, which was during the autumn. These days were also the busiest time, and the children had to help their adults with farm work. After the harvest was over, they also needed to rest for a few days and enjoy themselves, so he thought it was most appropriate to have vacation during this time. (2)

New Year Issue of the Entertainment World

### The Joys and Sorrows of the Film Industry Last Year

— Yin Ge

Generally, the film industry in the isolated island over the past year has been moving towards recovery. The active productions of Xinhua and Huaxin, the revival of Yihua, and the establishment of companies like Yaosheng and Guohua/Jifu all indicate that the film industry has new vitality. However, in terms of personnel, there have also been many joys and sorrows that are worth recalling. Now, let's categorize and record them below:

(1) Sorrow

The performance of a tragedy, the fall of a superstar, Shang Guanwu's "Alas, alas," is the most significant loss in the film industry over the past year. Many people shed tears and lamented his death because Shang Guanwu had considerable achievements on the screen. However, his amiability and sincerity were also the main reasons for earning people's sympathy. The most unfortunate thing is that Shang Guanwu's death was only a few months after his marriage to Yin Xiucen's niece, making Yin Xiucen's niece a "new bride" who soon became a "widow." When Shang Guanwu's body was lying in state at the funeral home, Mrs. Shang, while shedding tears, said to people, "I don't believe he's really dead! This is a play!" How desolate this is!

(2) Joy

Chen Yanyan gave birth to a baby bird. That was on November 22nd last year. On the third day after the birth, Chen Yanyan distributed red eggs generously, twelve for each relative and friend, without discrimination. On the full-month celebration, she held a grand "Tangbing" banquet at the Shuyu Sichuan Restaurant. Most of the male and female stars in the film industry were invited, which was like a grand gathering of filmmakers. Chen Yanyan and her "husband" Huang Shaofen greeted everyone warmly. Chen Yanyan was all smiles, and Huang Shaofen was also all smiles.

(3) Separation

There were two cases of film actors divorcing in the past year. One was Yu Guang and Mei Lin. Yu Guang's original name was Yu Fukang, and Mei Lin's original name was Qian Zhaolin. Before their marriage, Qian Zhaolin's father had proposed a condition to Yu Fukang, which was that he was not allowed to film any more movies. After their marriage, Yu Fukang once worked in a mining company recommended by his father-in-law. Because he didn't do very well, he later changed his name to Yu Guang and returned to the screen. Soon, his wife Qian Zhaolin also changed her name to Mei Lin and joined the film industry. After their marriage, they had two children in a few years. Unfortunately, in the spring of last year, Mei Lin was suddenly attracted by material things and had an affair with a Dr. Yan. Yu Guang and Mei Lin finally divorced because of this.

The second case was Lu Luming and Xu Xingzhi. After the war, Xu Xingzhi left Shanghai for Hong Kong and did not return for a long time. Lu Luming successively starred in several films in Shanghai, such as "Sunrise" and "Scandal," and suddenly became popular in the film industry. When Xu Xingzhi returned to Shanghai, Lu Luming had become a lover in the arms of a car-owning class, and the cohabitation relationship with Xu Xingzhi ended invisibly.

(4) Union

Two marriages were consummated in the film industry last year. One was Chen Yanyan and Huang Shaofen, and their engagement and marriage were both public. The other was Yuan Meiyun and Wang Yin. The union of these two lovers was initially half public and half secret, and they only officially became husband and wife after the war. There were two divorces of film couples and two unions in the past year, which was exactly "balanced."

### The Self-Admiring Charlie Chaplin - Six Beauties... A Fleeting Moment! - I wonder what Ms. Baohua thinks?

— Fang Ermu

Slapstick master Charlie Chaplin has maintained his position in Hollywood film history for fifteen years, and is still welcomed and supported by the world. This Ms. 資丽 is his seventh leading lady. After "Modern Times," which she starred in with Chaplin, was released, it caused a global sensation. However, when the film arrived in Germany, it was subject to some minor disturbances due to the exclusion of Jews (Chaplin is Jewish).

Recalling that Chaplin fifteen years ago was 1923, when Hollywood was in the era of silent films, the female lead in "The Kid," which he co-starred in with Jackie Coogan, was Edna Purviance, a figure he noticed. She helped Chaplin shoot several slapstick short films, gaining a considerable position. She continued to star in Chaplin's self-written and directed "A Woman of Paris." Later, she gave up screen work and lived her happy life in Hollywood. The second was Lita Grey. Chaplin fell for her, filmed a few movies, and they got married. Soon, they had a son, but he died at birth. As a result, there were conflicts between the two sides, and they separated. Paulette Goddard was a Spanish dancer. She had eyes that flashed like lightning and a willow-like waist. She captured Chaplin's heart, and they immediately cohabited, giving birth to two sons. At the same time, Chaplin was preparing to film "The Gold Rush," using her as the female lead, but she was good at stage plays, so he had to leave her due to some unavoidable problems, and compensated her with a lot of alimony. Georgia Hale was the fourth unfortunate woman. She continued filming the unfinished part of "The Gold Rush." She soon joined Fox Studios and is now retired. The next one is Kane 乃第. Chaplin and she filmed a movie set against the background of a circus, which was translated into Chinese as "The Circus." It took fifteen months to complete the filming, and this Ms. Kane left Chaplin. The sixth was Churchill. She was a Chicago socialite. He introduced her to Hollywood to film "City Lights," playing a blind flower girl. It took thirteen months to film, and it is said that she is now married to a gentleman in London. Finally, let's mention Paulette Goddard. She came from stage plays and was favored by Chaplin, starring in "Modern Times." They did not marry on the surface, but they cohabited in secret. Recently, film magazines have reported news of their separation. This is just a rumor, and we can laugh it off. I am not in a position to predict the future outcome.

### Actor News - Gu Wuwei Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong

Gu Wuwei, the leader of the Hong Kong Lee Theatre Standard Drama Troupe, arrived in Shanghai on an Italian ship the other day. Yesterday, he met with reporters. According to him, his mission here is to resolve family matters and other miscellaneous affairs. Currently, the Standard Troupe is supporting the situation in Hong Kong and is barely managing. As for the personnel, he has recruited many people in Hunan and Guangxi. If there are suitable roles in Shanghai, he also plans to invite a few people. In the afternoon, Mr. Gu ordered his daughter Gu Baolian to visit Wang Xichun backstage at the Carlton Grand Theatre to inquire about the address of Kun Dan Chen Yujun. Lan Chen in Hong Kong once made a guest appearance at the Lee Theatre for three days and was very popular with the Hong Kong people. It is likely that Mr. Gu wants to hire her to return to Hong Kong. Mr. Gu also told reporters that Lin Shusen has been brewing to go to Hong Kong for more than a day, but it has not been realized. If he is willing to go, there is a possibility of negotiating cooperation.

Xiao Sanmazi Negotiates Renewal

Since the famous actor Xiao Sanmazi joined the Tianchan Stage, he has been very popular with the audience. As of the day before yesterday (New Year's Eve), his contract has expired. The front desk is negotiating with Xiao Ling about the conditions for renewal, requesting half of the monthly salary, while Xiao Ling insists on two-thirds, so no agreement has been reached. However, the two sides are still negotiating. If a break occurs, Xiao Ling will leave after performing for three days (helping out for three days), or it may be possible to salvage the situation and perform until the end of the year. How things will be next spring will be negotiated again.

Li Zhonglin Will Accept a Southern Invitation

Since Mr. Dong Zhaobin's China Stage, which he organized, failed to update the stage, he is still actively looking for a site. On the one hand, he is inviting roles. Li Zhonglin, a Wenwu Laosheng recruited by Mr. Guo Chunpu, has replied, agreeing to go south after the overall situation is stable, with a salary of 3,000 yuan. Currently, Zhonglin is performing in Tianjin and is very popular with the music lovers.

### The So-Called Truth, Beauty, and Goodness

— Yan Youxiang

There are three major elements in making movies: namely, "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness." Truth is reality, beauty is art, and as for goodness, it is not betraying the justice of mankind. These three conditions are the focus of any film! Some people do not interpret "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness" this way, but in the current environment, I think it is necessary to say so.

I once heard a friend say that Chinese films are now gradually moving away from reality. His words are quite right. Film companies have indeed undergone some changes recently, but I personally have an unwavering view: that a film that deviates from "Truth" and emphasizes "Beauty," no matter what, cannot deviate from "Goodness"! You must know that of all things in the world, only "Goodness" is enough to be immortal. If you want a film to have a backbone, to deeply move people, and even to be embraced by people, the key is to have the existence of "Goodness"! Qin Shi Huang built the Epang Palace, which was beautiful, but goodness was completely lost, and in the end, he was scolded by people! What time is it now? If you think about it, you will not think my words are nonsensical.

Leaving the old and welcoming the new, another year has begun. In addition to reviewing the past, we must consider the future. I am a film worker, and I always talk about my own profession. Therefore, I record my humble thoughts above, awaiting the correction of those who know better.

### Congratulations on the Staging of the Yang HuaiChun Love Homicide Case

— Que Shuisheng

After the sensational He Die and Yang Huaichun love homicide case in Shanghai, various entertainment venues competed to collect information about the details of the case and adapt them into scripts for performance. The Lianyou Drama Troupe of the Great World has completed the arrangement and is scheduled to premiere the evening show on the sixth of this month. Mr. Xu, the brother-in-law of Yang Huaichun, the protagonist of the case, and the son of barrister Fan Gang, visited Ding Yongchang, the manager of the Great World, and Yuan, the son of Mr. Huang Jinrong, to inquire about the plot. They also talked with Zhu Yan, the director of the Lianyou Drama Troupe, fearing that the plot would be inconsistent with the facts and confuse the audience. They gave detailed instructions so that the public could understand the truth. He Die is played by Xu Renqiu, the pillar of the troupe, and Yang Huaichun is played by the romantic young man Yin Mengshi. The two are known for their acting skills and are praised by the audience. When it is staged, they will definitely be able to bring out the plot completely, so that the audience can sympathize with these two lovers who sacrificed for love and cry out in pain for them. Alas!

### Secret History of the Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (6) (2)

— Xu Muyun

Again, Most of Tan Pai's Plays Were Taught by His Wife

This girl often kindly made a set so that the old man would favor her, and of course, he didn't want to go against her wishes in any way. In this way, over the years, the old girl has heard at least thirty or fifty operas, and she can sing with a similar tone and flavor to Old Tan. Youchen also often watched Old Tan's operas, and he had a phonograph at home. All seven and a half records of Old Tan were bought, and he imitated Tan's tunes all day long. In addition, he had a good talent and had a clear voice. At that time, there were not many people learning Tan's style. Jia Honglin's voice soon broke, Wang Yutian had died early, and Gui Junqing learned Tan's style, which was the same as the later dog seller. Youchen married the old girl home, and in the boudoir, "husband and wife sang in harmony," and soon she taught him all the plays that Old Tan emphasized singing. As for plays that relied on props and those with a little martial arts, he had to put them aside. (meaning he couldn't handle them) I remember once at the Grand Stage, he reluctantly posted a "Dingjun Mountain," and the poster said it would be with 崭渊. Who knew that he said halfway through the play, "I can't do the rest." The stage manager knew that he couldn't do it, but if he didn't sing 斩渊, he was afraid that the audience would riot. He quickly took Zhang Rongkui to the backstage by car (Rongkui had already finished his play and gone home) and discussed it with him, and finally, Xia Houyuan was beheaded. At that time, the "with" character on the poster, such as "Release" with Inn" and "Black Basin" with Road," was written as "代". This "Dingjun Mountain" was no exception. However, all the other "代" characters were inappropriate, only Youchen's "Dingjun Mountain 代斩渊" was indeed appropriate; because he had temporarily asked Zhang Rongkui to "代" for him.

Youchen first came to Shanghai in the early years of the Republic of China, and performed at the New New Stage hosted by Huang Chu Jiu. The accompanying qin player was Sun Laoyuan, and the drummer was Liu Shun. He also hung a sign for Sun Lao with the words "China's No. 1 Qin Player." Both Sun and Liu were old people of his father-in-law, and with the title of son-in-law of a great Tan king, he was enough to call for attention at that time. Later, when he performed at Yiwu Stage, he also used Xu Lanyuan and Hang Zihe, who were still the scenes used by Old Tan in his later years. Even so, he still couldn't guarantee that there would be no mistakes. Once, I heard him play "Release," and he actually sang two sentences, "The horse is in the narrow road and it is difficult to turn the horse," which made Xu and Hang so anxious that they were sweating profusely. They quickly whispered to him the next line, "This is the flower following the water, and the water cannot love the flower," and he continued. It can be seen that the ability he learned from his teacher's wife was not authentic, let alone what he was taught by his master's sister-in-law. That being said, but at a time when there is an extreme shortage of talents for Sheng, to be honest, Youchen's "Entering the Palace," "Visiting Mother," "Bumping the Tablet," and "Crying for the Spirit Tablet at the Linked Camp" do have a lingering sound. Unfortunately, he died young. I think if there is anyone who learns Tan's tune but cannot get instructions from Shuyan, why not ask this Mrs. Wang (the old girl)?
