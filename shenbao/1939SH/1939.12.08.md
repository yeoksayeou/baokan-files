They have already captured Xiaodong, 20 kilometers north of Qinzhou. Another Chinese force has set out from Hepu and is advancing northwest toward Qinzhou to threaten the Japanese rear. The Chinese and Japanese forces in the Nanning area appear to be fiercely contesting two key mountain passes, one northeast of Nanning on the Yongbin Highway, and the other north of Nanning on the Yongwu Highway.

The Japanese army's recent goal was to advance towards Binyang, northwest of Nanning, but this attempt has been foiled by the Chinese army's recapture of Batang, located between Nanning and Binyang. The Chinese and Japanese armies are now engaged in fierce fighting south of Batang. The Chinese army's recapture of Batang was due to the effectiveness of the Chinese army's flanking strategy. Another Japanese force, with Wuming as its target, has been stalled at Dagao Fenxu (30 kilometers north of Nanning) by the Chinese counter-attack. Furthermore, the Chinese militia and local armed civilians are harassing the Japanese rear at Xiaodong, 20 kilometers north of Qinzhou, and Lingshan, northeast of Qinzhou. Finally, the Japanese army advancing from Fangcheng has been intercepted by the Chinese army northwest and west of Fangcheng. The spokesperson also stated that the Japanese army in the Nanning area consists of two divisions, and it is expected that the Japanese side will transfer another division from eastern Guangdong for reinforcement.

### 軍行會發表　一週戰况

Military Council Announces Weekly Battle Situation

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week, the Japanese army on various fronts has been constantly moving, and the Chinese army has repeatedly launched significant blows to the Japanese army. The Japanese army in Guangdong, Guangxi, and southern Shanxi has suffered heavy losses, and their attempts to invade have been gradually crushed by the Chinese army. The more important aspects of the combat operations are described below:

(Guangdong and Guangxi) The Japanese army, which has invaded Nanning, has continued to advance north along two routes this week, coordinating land and air forces. One route is along the Yongwu Highway, attacking Gaofeng'ao, and the other is along the Yongbin Highway, attacking Batang, with a very strong offensive. The Chinese army has launched separate counterattacks. The fighting has been extremely fierce. Gaofeng'ao and Batang were successively occupied by the Japanese army, but after a fierce counterattack, over 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed, and Batang was recaptured. The remnants of the Japanese army in Gaofeng'ao were tightly surrounded by China. At the same time, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese flank, recapturing Xiaodong, and completely destroying the highway bridges behind the Japanese army, cutting off their supply line. The Japanese army was attacked from the front and the rear, and was extremely panicked. The Japanese army in Sanshui was subjected to repeated fierce attacks by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army successively recaptured Xianjueyuan, Huangtang, and other strongholds. The Japanese army retreated in disarray towards Yangmei. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked and entered Jiujiang, capturing and seizing many supplies. Furthermore, the Chinese army has continuously attacked the Japanese army along the XinKai and XinHe roads. The Chinese army has successively recaptured Luo Jia and Bai Zhu Shan, and charged into Daxiaomeishan. Currently, Jianghui and other cities have been completely controlled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army occupying Yinzhan'ao has been encircled and attacked by the Chinese army for three consecutive days, and has suffered heavy losses. In recent days, they have continued to retreat along various routes towards Juntian. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to press towards Juntian and intensified the attack. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered over a thousand casualties and has become a spent force. As for the Chinese army that is advancing towards Zengcheng, since the 29th, it has approached the county seat and has completely cut off Japanese transportation to Fuhe in the northwest, Zhuguling in the north, and Jiaoshiling in the east.

Editorial

### 美國的遠東政策

America's Far East Policy

Recently, the United States and Japan have once again revealed their diplomatic activities in Tokyo. On Monday of this week, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura held talks with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, the contents of which were not made public. Washington claims that Nomura has expressed a willingness to address U.S. demands in a conciliatory manner; Tokyo, on the other hand, says that the U.S. attitude has become slightly more constructive than before. Comparing the two sides, it is clear that each has made considerable concessions. However, whether or not the adjustment work can proceed smoothly is a major issue. As evidenced by the fact that after the Nomura-Grew talks, Japanese public opinion is still putting on airs and advising the United States not to force Japan into the arms of the Soviet Union, it can be seen that the adjustment work has not yet made any headway.

Future changes in U.S.-Japan relations will be reflected in trade issues between the two countries. If a new U.S.-Japan trade agreement cannot be reached after January 25 of next year, and Japan continues its actions in China to exclude the rights and interests of other countries, then the United States will likely implement further economic retaliation. At that time, the way to resolve the U.S.-Japan conflict will definitely not be a U.S.-Japan war, but will depend on China's resistance. Taking the current situation as a starting point, there are only two possible paths to expect a sudden turn for the better in the U.S.-Japan dispute. Either the United States fundamentally changes its Far East policy, or Japan shows through its actions that it has abandoned its ambitions in the Far East.

Since John Hay advocated the Open Door Policy towards China, the United States' Far East policy has been based on preserving the integrity of China's territorial and administrative sovereignty and maintaining the principle of equal opportunity for all countries. The Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 was based on this principle. In recent years, no matter how the situation in the Far East has changed, although the United States has sometimes been unable to fulfill its treaty obligations with other countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty, it has always adhered to this principle. However, since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, it has repeatedly declared that the Nine-Power Treaty has become outdated and has created a so-called "New Order in the Far East" to exclude the rights and interests of third countries in China, to dominate Asia, and to subvert the various economic relations of the great powers in the Far East, directly shattering the United States' Far East policy and indirectly laying the foundation for threatening U.S. security. For the sake of its Far East interests and for the sake of its own security, the United States cannot, of course, stand idly by.

Many American political commentators believe that the United States must re-decide many of its foreign policies in 1939. Its European foreign policy has already been decided by the revision of the Neutrality Act. A part of its Far East policy has already entered a new stage with the announcement of the termination of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. But how to decide in the end will depend on the next Congress. However, what is being expressed on all sides is absolutely not an image of abandoning its Far East policy. The U.S. government's announcement of the termination of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, and the strengthening of all military preparations in response to the Pacific crisis, show the government's determination to maintain its consistent Far East policy. As for the people of England, they mostly express deep sympathy for China's resistance. Over the past two years, the anti-Japanese aggression movement automatically launched by the American people, demanding that the government stop exporting military materials to Japan and boycott Japanese goods, has been numerous. In particular, the general public opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of taking a tough stance against Japan. Not long ago, the New York Daily News advocated that Japan must first withdraw its troops from China before U.S.-Japan trade relations can continue. This shows how enthusiastically the American people support the traditional Far East policy!

Of course, there are also a few isolationists who, because of party strife, hope to strike at their political enemies by opposing traditional principles. The former isolationist giant, Borah, once advocated continuing U.S.-Japan commerce to maintain the interests of the domestic economic community. However, the isolationists' advocacy in American politics is no longer welcomed by the general public. This has become a generally recognized fact. For example, when the Neutrality Act was revised last time, the isolationists opposed the revision of the Neutrality Act in order to oppose maintaining the profits of arms dealers. If they oppose stopping trade with Japan in the future with the interests of the economic community as a pretext, the contradiction between their previous and subsequent actions will be completely expressed as a debate based on party views and will no longer be able to gain the trust of the majority of the people. Furthermore, if the U.S. government is prepared to change its traditional policy, to accept Japan's demands, then Borah and others would certainly vehemently oppose it.

Since the U.S. government and people mostly tend to maintain the traditional Far East policy, while Japan seems to be unable to recognize the United States' determination, she still wants to use the diplomatic guarantee of "Oriental goods" to cover up the crimes of her military actions in China and to appease the U.S.'s intense emotions. This is one-sided wishful thinking, this is ineffective and futile. This is similar to how Japan is flying the banner of anti-communism, and also wants to coerce China to follow it in anti-communism, while at the same time wanting to improve relations with the Soviet Union. How contradictory and ridiculous is this? We cannot imagine that humanity would allow such unreasonableness to succeed. Therefore, the recent diplomatic developments in Tokyo are just Japan asking the United States to explain the U.S.'s Far East policy again. The brightness of U.S.-Japan relations, the brightness of the Far East, does not lie in diplomacy, but in Japan abandoning its aggression!

Washington: It is rumored that the United States Export-Import Bank will lend $75 million to the Chinese government. The bank has recently denied this. According to a person in charge of the bank, the United States is currently unable to lend cash to any country. Other sources claim that Roosevelt will ask the next Congress to double the cash of the Export-Import Bank. If so, China may be able to obtain a loan, but this move will have to wait several months to be realized. At the same time, the Chinese representative in the United States also denied that the United States is providing a new loan to China. However, Wall Street sources say that the United States will use huge loans to stabilize China's legal currency. (7th United Press Dispatch)

Washington: A State Department official said last night that he could not comment on Ambassador Grew's talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura, other than the communique issued by Tokyo. Observers here believe that the talks did not involve specific proposals, and at least did not mention basic policies towards Japan. What was discussed was the Japanese compensation for the loss of American interests in China. Officials here believe that the purpose of the Tokyo talks was to investigate the possibility of continuing negotiations between the US and Japan to solve various problems. The small Japanese embassy here only said that this talk included most issues related to China and hoped to quickly reach a satisfactory solution. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Washington: The United States and Japan have agreed on temporary trade measures. After the expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement, trade between the two countries may be temporarily maintained but can be changed at any time. Everything depends on the actions of the Japanese side. If the Japanese side continues to threaten American citizens in China and hinder American interests, this temporary measure will immediately become invalid. At the very least, the United States will increase import tariffs on Japanese goods. If the Japanese side angers the American side too much, the United States will also boycott Japanese goods. Everything depends on what measures the Japanese army takes. (7th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo: When the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Information Director, Shigemitsu, met with foreign reporters on the 5th, an American reporter asked if Japan was preparing to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. Information Director Shigemitsu replied that the Japanese government is only negotiating with the Soviet Union to resolve long-standing issues and trade treaty issues. There are currently no preparations to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. On the morning of the 6th, the counselor of the American Embassy in Japan, Dooman, specifically visited the director of the American Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yoshizawa, to inquire whether the Information Director's conversation was the opinion of the Japanese government. Director Yoshizawa replied, "Yes," and at the same time expressed that the American attitude towards Japan has a major impact on the future of Japanese-Soviet relations, requesting the American government to pay special attention to this matter.

The British government has not made such a decision on the plan to confiscate German exports carried by neutral ships on the high seas. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

London: Undersecretary of State Butler replied to Labour MP Noel-Baker in the House of Commons last night that Ambassador Craigie to Japan had recently informally exchanged views with the Japanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tani, on the status of Tianjin and other outstanding issues. Noel-Baker asked, was the issue of silver deposits in Tianjin mentioned and will the British government still abide by its previously announced policy? Butler replied that when discussing all issues in the Tianjin situation, the issue of silver deposits cannot be an exception. But I can confirm that the British government will always abide by the principles previously stated to Tokyo. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

### Soviet Troops Advance; Finnish Forces Reinforce the North to Resist; Soviets Claim to Have Broken Through Main Finnish Defense Line; Heavy Snowstorms in Finland Hinder Soviet Operations

Helsinki: It has been learned here that the Soviet Union has deployed the 7th Army, commanded by General Meretskov, to the Karelian Isthmus and the area of Lake Ladoga. The 7th Army is reported to consist of seven infantry divisions and four tank divisions. It is believed that more than half of them have entered Karelia and are now advancing towards the outer defense line of Helsinki, intending to reach the important railway that runs southeast from Oulu on the Gulf of Bothnia to the Soviet border. It is reported that 80,000 Soviet troops and 40,000 Finnish troops are currently engaged in skirmishes in the Karelian Isthmus. The Finnish army is said to number about 500,000, including several Russian officers who participated in the 1917 civil war. It is reported that the Soviet troops are wearing rubber galoshes instead of leather boots, which makes their movement quite uncomfortable. Residents of Finnish cities are still being evacuated. Very few civilians remain in Helsinki. Reporters yesterday visited a hospital 20 miles outside Helsinki and saw 100 adults and 25 children who were injured in the Helsinki air raids being treated. Some of them were seriously injured. It is reported that 25 anti-aircraft guns that Finland previously ordered from the Bofors arms factory in Sweden, which could not be delivered in time, are now being transported to Finland. Three spies who were sending wireless messages to Moscow have been discovered in Helsinki and executed today. (7th dispatch from Reuters)

Helsinki: A heavy fog enveloped Helsinki this morning, obscuring everything, even the treetops. The ice has melted, and a light rain is falling. The residents are particularly relieved as the weather makes air raids impossible. The latest news from the front has not indicated any major battles. It is reported that Soviet troops have reached the outposts of the Mannerheim Line in one or two places. The strength of the Finnish defense line should be truly tested in the next few days.

Helsinki: According to news from here today, the Soviet Red Army is still advancing from the north and east under strong resistance from the Finnish forces. Although news from the various fronts is extremely scarce, the battles in northern Finland, northern Lake Ladoga, and the Karelian Isthmus are all extremely fierce. The blizzards in various parts of Finland are greatly helping the Finnish forces in their resistance. Firstly, Soviet aircraft are not conducive to flying in the current climate, and secondly, it is extremely difficult for Soviet aircraft to identify targets in the snow. At the same time, the advance of the Soviet army is greatly hindered by the snowstorms. As for the Soviet navy, it is troubled by ice and difficult to maneuver. It is also reported that there is only one highway in northern Soviet Union from Petsamo to the Finnish interior, and that road has now been heavily damaged by Finnish forces, making it impossible for the Soviet Red Army's mechanized units to operate. According to reports, the Soviet Red Army attempted to land on the Paula area east of Helsinki on the first of this month. Although this move was repelled by the Finnish side, it is generally believed here that the Soviet Union will soon land along the southern coast of Finland, so the industrial centers and populations along the southern coast of Finland have all been evacuated.

Helsinki: It is claimed that the total number of Finnish losses to date is estimated at 1,000. (7th dispatch from Reuters)

Copenhagen: According to news from here today, in order to end the war against Finland as soon as possible, the Soviet Union is now assembling troops and warships to launch a three-pronged attack on Finland. Currently, Soviet troops are making a frontal assault on the Petsamo Peninsula. (7th dispatch from United Press)

Helsinki: A Soviet announcement claims that its troops have broken through Finland's "Mannerheim Line." This statement has been firmly denied by Finnish officials. Recent inclement weather has greatly slowed military operations along the line from the Gulf of Finland to the Arctic Ocean. Heavy snow has continued to fall in the north and east, while along the Arctic Ocean, the nights are long and the days short, with almost perpetual darkness, hindering activities on land, sea, and air. Along the 700-800 kilometer line from Lake Ladoga to the Arctic Ocean, Soviet troops often lose contact and suffer untold hardships due to the sparsely populated terrain. In addition, Finnish troops have set up ambushes everywhere, causing heavy losses to Soviet reconnaissance units when they fall into these traps. Furthermore, the fighting along the coast of the Gulf of Finland has also stalled, with Finnish authorities taking defensive measures along the coast that make it difficult for Soviet troops to land. In short, the Finnish national spirit is extremely high, and they are actively assisting the government in strengthening defenses and jointly resisting foreign aggression, making them difficult to defeat.

Soviet War Report

Moscow: The Leningrad Military District has released the following recent war report: As of the night of December 6, the progress of the units in our military district is as follows: In the Murmansk area, the Red Army has suppressed the resistance of the Finnish White Army and advanced to a line 35 kilometers south of Petsamo. In the areas of Uhta, Repola, Porosozero, and Petrozavodsk, the Red Army has won victories and crossed the Nurmes-Joensuu railway, advancing to a line 60 to 65 kilometers from the border. In the eastern Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops, after artillery bombardment, have broken through the main Finnish defensive line built along the Vuoksi River, the so-called "Maginot-Koikkala Line," and are advancing north after crossing the Taipaleenjoki River. In the western Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops have continued to occupy the Kiviniemi station on the Käkisalmi railway, the Koppiokivi station on the Vyborg-Valkjärvi railway branch, the Raunaiski and Piikhoivi stations on the Vyborg railway, the Ino and Maisteriavi stations on the coastal railway, and the Hirsniemi village (9 kilometers west of the Ino fortress) on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Due to the continued inclement weather today, only reconnaissance aircraft were active in the air. (7th dispatch from TASS)

London: According to Finnish sources here, the Soviet fleet is very active in the Baltic Sea, shelling the Hogland Islands to cover troop landings. Several smaller warships are also operating on Lake Ladoga. However, due to the bad weather, Soviet aircraft have been unable to operate. In addition, Red Army outposts have now penetrated 20 kilometers into Finnish territory, not far from the second line of the Mannerheim Line. (6th dispatch from Havas)

Helsinki: The Finnish News Agency has recently issued a message stating: "Soviet troops used various poison gases yesterday when attacking our artillery positions north of Lake Ladoga. Eleven of our soldiers have suffocated to death. Furthermore, after the recovery of the northern port of Petsamo, it is still in our hands. Our famous tin mining area (25 kilometers from the coast and 60 kilometers from the Soviet border) is still operating normally and has not been threatened in any way. The majority of the workers are building a power plant in the town of Pasvik (Boris Gleb), hoping to supply electricity to the mining area." (7th dispatch from Havas)

### Meeting of Three Foreign Ministers Held in Oslo; Danish Parliament Rejects Motion to Sever Ties with the Soviet Union

Oslo: Danish Foreign Minister Munch and Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler arrived here this morning in succession, and immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 9:30 AM to hold a meeting with Foreign Minister Koht to discuss the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, as well as the Finnish government's application to the League of Nations.

Geneva: An editorial in the Swiss Daily News today criticized the upcoming League of Nations meeting as being over-hyped, and stated that the Swiss government could legally remind the League of Nations that the meeting is taking place within the territory of a neutral country. From Switzerland's standpoint, it should maintain the same attitude towards all neighboring countries and not take sides. It further stated that the pillars of the current League of Nations are only the two great powers of Britain and France. Although Poland has been divided by Germany and the Soviet Union, Britain and France still recognize the Soviet Union as neutral. From this, it is not difficult to predict that Britain and France will not provide Finland with real assistance. If the League of Nations cannot provide Finland with practical assistance, it would be better to remain a bystander and avoid taking actions that would be detrimental to Switzerland's neutral status. (7th dispatch from Reuter's Far East Service)

Stockholm: It was announced here today that Sweden will send the president of Uppsala University to attend the League of Nations General Assembly, accompanied by the ambassador to Switzerland. Reports that Foreign Minister Sandler would personally go to Geneva have proven to be inaccurate. (7th dispatch from Reuter's Far East Service)

### Finnish Independence Day; Finnish President Announces Determination to Resist; States That the War Demonstrates the Spirit of Unity Among the People; Responsibility for Destroying Peace Should Be Borne by the Soviet Union; US President and Swedish King Send Congratulatory Messages to Finland

Helsinki: Finnish President Kallio delivered a broadcast address on Finland's Independence Day yesterday, stating that the celebration of Independence Day will not be halted by the Soviet-Finnish war, as this war is a demonstration of the Finnish people's spirit of unity. The Finnish President stated emphatically that Finland was drawn into the war due to the Soviet Union's attack. The Soviet Union used the security of Leningrad as a pretext to propose amendments to the border, requesting territory that Finns have inhabited for generations. We have never threatened the security of Leningrad or the peace with the Soviet Union. Finland hoped to achieve a peaceful resolution through negotiations, but the Soviet Union's demands were incompatible with Finland's security, so the Finnish government, in accordance with the decision of Parliament, could not accept them. After the breakdown of negotiations, unfortunate incidents occurred on the Soviet-Finnish border. During a Soviet artillery exercise, several people were killed and injured, and the Soviet Union blamed the Finnish army, claiming to the world that Finland had destroyed peace by shelling Soviet territory. After Finland rejected this unreasonable accusation, the Soviet Union unilaterally abolished the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty, and Soviet troops crossed the border a week ago and attacked Finland. Although we had the desire for a peaceful resolution, we have also been dragged into the war. People in various countries should now understand that the cause of the war is not that the security of Leningrad is threatened, because Soviet troops are launching a full-scale attack along the entire line from Petsamo to Rajajoki, and in the Hanko area. Therefore, the Soviet Union's goal is to destroy our independence and autonomy and to deprive us of all the rights that we regard as sacred. Fortunately, the entire population is deeply aware of the severity of the national crisis and is determined to defend the country and resist Soviet aggression. People in various countries have also expressed deep sympathy. (7th dispatch from Reuter's Far East Service)

President Roosevelt has sent a telegram to Finnish President Kallio, stating: "I, on behalf of the people and government of my country, express my admiration to the people and government of your country, and hope that the tragic situation you are currently experiencing will soon pass, so that you can resume developing social enterprises." (6th dispatch from Havas)

Stockholm: Yesterday was the 22nd anniversary of Finland's independence. Swedish King Gustaf V sent a telegram to Finnish President Kallio, reiterating Sweden's strong support for Finland's independence, and stating that this sentiment has become stronger due to the increasingly close cooperation between the Nordic countries. Your country's serious crisis is deeply understood by the entire people of my country, and we express our deep sympathy. (7th dispatch from Reuter's Far East Service)

(7th dispatch from Reuter's Far East Service)

Washington: The diplomatic negotiations undertaken by American republics in preparation for issuing a joint protest to the Soviet Union have encountered great difficulties.

### Secretary of the German Consulate in New York, Engelburg, Murdered

New York: Dr. Engelburg, the secretary of the German Consul General in New York, was found in his home in Brooklyn today, his head broken and lying on the ground. Traces indicated that he had struggled violently when he was attacked. Police found a large supply of food in his house, enough to last for a year, and eight wooden boxes filled with dried food and canned goods in the garage. (Sixth dispatch from Reuters)

New York: A bizarre case has emerged with the discovery of a body in the Brooklyn residence of Dr. Engelburg, secretary to the German Consulate General in New York. New York police are currently conducting a thorough investigation. Initially, it was thought that the body was that of the doctor himself, murdered by someone. However, it was later learned that it was not the doctor, and the doctor himself is also missing, adding to the mystery. After a thorough investigation, the police have found little concrete evidence as to the identity of the body, so they have had to conclude that its origin is unknown. According to the New York Daily News, the body's head was broken, and its face was blurred and unrecognizable. Medical examiners recorded that the body's height, weight, and hair color were all very different from the doctor's appearance as described by neighbors. Therefore, it was decided that it was not the doctor himself. Today, the German Consulate issued a notice to the police, stating that the doctor had not been to the office for several days, and when they called, no one answered. When the police entered the doctor's house, they found all the lights on, and there were signs of a struggle in the room where the body was found. It seemed that the deceased must have fought hard before meeting his demise. The house contained a large supply of food and wine, enough for one person for a year. The garage also contained eight wooden boxes filled with dried food and canned goods. According to the police, the doctor was a member of the Nazi Party and came to the United States sixteen months ago. He was initially stationed in Chicago and later transferred to New York.

### Japanese Troops Invade Guangxi, Deploying All Elite Forces

Three Division Designations Discovered

Shen Rongguang Guides Them Across the Shiwan Mountains

Chinese Troops Form a Large Arc for Fierce Counterattack

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese troops landing at Qinzhou Bay this time, directly attacking Nanning, are rumored to have deployed their full elite force, gambling everything in order to find an opportunity for a decisive battle and attempt to "end the China Incident." However, this move by the Japanese army indeed runs the risk of a "lone army" penetrating deep into enemy territory, much like Zhuge Liang's secret crossing of Chencang Valley, a tactic not favored by wise military strategists. The Japanese army has always relied on heavy weaponry, artillery, and tanks. This time, landing at Qinzhou Bay, they had to pass through the Shiwan Mountains and the Gou Lou mountain range. The roads had already been destroyed by the Chinese side, so it should have been difficult to cross into Guangxi Province. However, the Japanese army used Shen Rongguang, the son of the Guangxi warlord Shen Hongying (who was made a puppet in Shantou last month), to lead his old troops as guides, taking the narrow and winding paths around the Shiwan Mountains, directly threatening the Yu River. Moreover, they abandoned the tanks and artillery that they had always relied on for combat and victory, instead using aerial bombing to replace artillery strikes. They engaged in fierce fighting outside Nanning for five days, supplying food by air, and frantically bombing nearby cities to prevent Chinese reinforcements from advancing. This tactic is appearing in the Chinese theater for the first time. If they had not deployed the most elite troops, they would not have dared to risk such a deep penetration. If they had not used the most elite troops, they would not have been able to achieve the expected results after taking the risk.

As of now, three divisions of the Japanese army have landed at Qinzhou Bay. Two of these divisions are the main forces defending against Russia in the Northeast. Another division was formed by drawing troops from Kumamoto, Konoe, Osaka, and other places to the Jiaoji Railway, and then secretly transported south from Qingdao. The remaining troops belong to Ando's forces, which have been harassing Guangdong Province, transferred from Guangzhou, Shantou, Hainan, Xiamen, Taiwan, and other places, mainly consisting of cavalry, engineers, chemical warfare units, and marines. The newly formed South China Fleet, commanded by Kosa Shiro as the supreme commander, is completing the first phase of the naval southward advance strategy. Capturing Nanning is not limited to the southwest Chinese theater. This matter has a profound relationship with the Japanese navy's control of the western Pacific. The forced landing of a British Empire aircraft flying from Hong Kong after being pursued shows that the airspace and waters of East Asia have a new master controlling them.

The significance of the Nanning war poses a major threat to neighboring Britain and France. The Japanese army left the Nomishima Brigade to garrison behind Qinzhou, forcibly conscripting able-bodied men and women from the surrounding villages to build the Yongqin Highway in order to support the lone army entering Guangxi. They also built three rear strongholds in Xiaodong, Pingji, and Luwu, sparing no expense in using alcohol instead of water to mix cement and build a number of gun emplacements to control the outer perimeter of Qinzhou. Cement mixed with alcohol can dry and harden in two hours, making the newly built gun emplacements very solid. The Japanese army entered Guangxi in three routes. Those based in Luwu advanced towards Lingshan and Hengxian, intending to attack Yulin. Those based in Xiaodi crossed the mountains and entered Datang, Tangbao, Nama, Wucunxu, and Tingzi, directly attacking Nanning City. Another small group advanced from Dazhixu and Dasi, diagonally out to Tiancheng, to spy on Baise. Before the 15th, the Chinese army was dispersing its forces to defend a front line of hundreds of miles, not knowing where the Japanese army would break through. Now that the military situation has become clear, the Chinese army can take the initiative according to the target and launch a fierce counterattack against the Japanese army, because those who have entered Guangxi are still a lone army with light weapons. The south bank of the Yu River is also a mountainous and dangerous area, which is conducive to repelling the enemy. As for the three Japanese divisions, namely Okabe, Suzuki, and Imamura, the flames of war have now spread across both the north and south banks of the Yu River. The two regiments of Miki and Kanazawa, who crossed the north bank, fought fiercely with the Chinese army in Liangqing, Gaomiao, and Tingzi for three days and nights. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Nanning City and nearby villages and towns have been turned into wastelands after repeated bombing by Japanese aircraft. The Chinese army has no need to defend it, and the Japanese army gains nothing by taking it. The area traversed by the Japanese army is like a narrow corridor. Within these hundred kilometers, manpower and resources have long been evacuated, leaving nothing behind. The two sides of the front line have been turned into guerrilla zones, surrounded on three sides by the Chinese army. This most elite Japanese army will make a silent retreat. Chinese generals Wei Yunsong, Xia Wei, Cai Tingkai, Huang Gu, Mo Shujie, Deng Shizeng, Zhang Yan, and others are dividing their troops to form a large arc of counterattack positions. A full-scale counterattack has begun during the day. Fierce fighting has taken place in Fengling, Lugongci, and Changgangling, northeast of Nanning, since the 24th, blocking the most elite Japanese army. When the main force is fully assembled, there will be a very large-scale battle.

### Recent Ugly Behavior of Suzhou Puppets

Clashes Between Japanese and Puppet Rickshaw Pullers

Puppet County Government Openly Solicits Bribes

Suzhou Correspondence: The puppets here have recently staged a farce. Dong Youxian, the head of the police department of the puppet provincial capital, was originally a gangster from the Chamen area. Since taking office in the puppet government, he has become increasingly bold and reckless. His henchmen are also helping him to do evil. The other day, Dong was hosting a banquet for a prostitute named Qingqing at the Zhongxinli brothel in Guanqian. His car was parked in the street. A car driven by Ide, an official of the Japanese appeasement team specializing in passes, arrived and, seeing that Dong's car was blocking the way, the Japanese rickshaw puller intended to move the car. However, he was stopped by Dong's rickshaw puller, who slapped him several times. Because the Japanese rickshaw puller was wearing Chinese worker's clothes at the time, he was not recognized as Japanese. The Japanese rickshaw puller gathered a group of people and beat Dong's rickshaw puller severely. Ide then notified the appeasement team to impose martial law on the area near Zhongxinli and search for the perpetrator's master. Dong was greatly alarmed and, along with the other puppets attending the banquet, fled through the back door, ending the happy gathering in a state of disarray.

Guo Zengji, the puppet governor of Wu County, relied on the power of Ichikawa, the head of the Japanese appeasement team, to oppress the people in every way. He was especially harsh in demanding "grain transportation permits." The "official fee" was about 400 yuan, while the bribe was 600 yuan. Therefore, the merchants were all groaning under the burden.

The copper yuan notes issued by the puppet Finance Department's treasury come in four denominations: one yuan, five yuan, fifteen yuan, and thirty yuan. The paper is thin and of poor quality, and tears easily after being circulated a few times. Therefore, although the market is forced to circulate them due to coercive pressure, people hate the puppet officials even more and prefer to receive the fractional currency notes issued by the Central Bank first.

### Jiangyin Historical Site Demolished

The Dasima Archway on West Main Street

Jiangyin Correspondence: The puppet county government is currently widening the streets in the city, from Gaoxiang on East Main Street to the intersection of Zhongshan Road on West Main Street, demolishing six meters of houses on both sides. All houses that were destroyed or partially destroyed during the looting are to be demolished. In the middle section of West Main Street, there is a Dasima Archway, built in the Ming Dynasty. In the past, when there were bandit disturbances on the border, elephant formations were used as the vanguard, but they were unable to resist and were repeatedly defeated. Gradually, they threatened the capital. The Ming Emperor summoned Xu Xi to design a bronze figure to break the elephant formations, recruit the border bandits, and appoint him to the Ministry of War. He repeatedly performed meritorious deeds and was promoted to Dasima. He was ordered to build an archway to commemorate his achievements forever. It is said that his descendants want to find a way to preserve it, or demolish it and move it to Zhongshan Park in order to preserve the historical site.

### Ministry of Education's Plan to Improve Overseas Chinese Education

Establish Overseas Chinese Education Commissioners and Inspectors

Improve School Education and Promote Social Education

(Chongqing Airmail News) During this year's Third National Education Conference, in addition to resolving and passing the motions on "rewarding overseas Chinese children to study specialized subjects abroad to cultivate talents for the anti-Japanese war and national reconstruction," "improving overseas Chinese primary school education" (detailed measures to be determined by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission), and "rewarding outstanding overseas Chinese children to return to China for further studies," the Ministry of Education's "Overseas Chinese Education Improvement Plan" was previously amended and passed by the conference and is now publicly announced by the Ministry of Education. The full text is as follows:

This plan is based on the wartime implementation plan for education at all levels and divides the key points for improving overseas Chinese education into: 1. Establishing overseas Chinese education commissioners and inspectors; 2. Improving overseas Chinese school education; 3. Promoting overseas Chinese social education. The measures are as follows:

(A) Establishing Overseas Chinese Education Commissioners and Inspectors: (1) Establishing overseas Chinese education commissioners and assigning them to various overseas locations to preside over overseas Chinese education administration and guide the improvement of overseas Chinese education. The candidates will be determined by the Ministry of Education in consultation with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as members of embassies and consulates. If there are suitable candidates in the embassy, they may be designated to concurrently serve. In places where there are no embassies or consulates, they may be established in overseas Chinese chambers of commerce or education associations. (2) The Ministry of Education will, in consultation with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, designate personnel to inspect overseas Chinese education annually. (3) The Ministry of Education will, in consultation with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, invite educational experts familiar with overseas Chinese education to organize overseas mobile lecture groups to convene local overseas Chinese teachers and lecture on educational methods in order to universally improve overseas Chinese education. (4) The Ministry of Education will, in consultation with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, formulate measures for overseas Chinese education commissioners and inspectors to supervise and handle overseas Chinese schools in various places in accordance with the revised regulations for overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools.

(B) Improving Overseas Chinese School Education: (1) Regarding subsidies for overseas Chinese schools, please ask the government to increase allocations, and the distribution should be considered to adopt methods such as subsidizing books and instruments and selecting professors and experts from various universities who have studied overseas Chinese affairs and overseas Chinese business to serve as lecturers in various subjects. (2) The Ministry of Education will, in consultation with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, organize an overseas Chinese primary and secondary school curriculum compilation committee to compile curricula suitable for overseas Chinese schools in various places based on the primary school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, taking into account the situation of overseas Chinese schools in concentrated areas. (3) The Ministry of Education will, in consultation with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, continue to revise or edit the overseas Chinese school textbooks that have been compiled based on the specific courses of overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools for the use of overseas Chinese schools. The following points should be noted when compiling: 1. Integrate the Three Principles of the People into the textbooks to achieve a subtle effect; 2. Include materials and historical facts related to the anti-Japanese war and national reconstruction in the textbooks to achieve the purpose of spiritual mobilization; 3. The textbooks should focus on local education materials to arouse the students' love for their hometowns; 4. Pay attention to the actual environment, especially providing overseas Chinese students with the things and knowledge that are most easily accessible, and compile supplementary reading materials for students in various categories. This supplementary reading material should adhere to the principle of adapting to the special needs of various places. (4) The Ministry of Education will, in consultation with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, select places with a concentration of overseas Chinese schools to establish one primary and secondary school each with relatively complete facilities as models for overseas Chinese schools, and may select excellent primary and secondary schools in various places and provide them with subsidies to serve as alternative model schools. (5) Colleges or universities should run overseas Chinese normal schools or establish overseas Chinese normal colleges, or run normal schools in appropriate places abroad, or designate secondary schools to set up normal classes to train teachers for overseas Chinese primary schools. All universities in China that have normal colleges should also add some courses on Southeast Asia, and the competent authorities should continue to run overseas Chinese teacher training classes and overseas Chinese summer training classes for rotational training. (6) The Ministry of Education will, in consultation with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, establish overseas Chinese school teacher referral offices in appropriate places in China to register teachers who are willing to serve in overseas Chinese schools, strictly examine them, and carefully select those with excellent qualifications and learning to be responsible for introducing them to overseas service. All those who participate in the registration will be issued registration certificates by the competent authorities, and the qualifications obtained can be applied to various places. Except for reporting changes in service locations in accordance with the law, they are not subject to regional restrictions. In addition, the competent authorities should separately stipulate measures that overseas Chinese schools that have been registered and employ registered qualified teachers in one-third or three-quarters or more will be given special convenience for their graduating students to return to China for further studies.

### Lixin Accounting College Adds Five-Year Program

Lixin Accounting College at 406 Jiangxi Road in this city was approved by the Ministry of Education to open this summer and enrolled a first-year class of new students (high school graduates) in the fall. The original academic system was three years of graduation. Now, with the approval of the Ministry of Education, the original academic system has been changed to two types: a five-year system and a two-year system. The five-year system enrolls junior high school graduates or those with equivalent academic qualifications who have passed the entrance examination. The two-year system enrolls high school graduates or those with equivalent academic qualifications who have passed the entrance examination. The addition of a five-year system to the college's academic system is a first for vocational colleges. The advantage of this academic system is that it combines advanced vocational schools and colleges. In this way, the curriculum can have a consistent system without duplication. In terms of learning efficiency, it can also be greatly improved. It is said that the school plans to add a five-year system next spring, enrolling a first-year class of new students who have graduated from junior high school or have equivalent qualifications. The entrance examination will be held only once, around the beginning of February next spring. The examination subjects include civics, Chinese, English, mathematics, history, geography, physics and chemistry, and oral examination. New students for the two-year system will be recruited again during the summer vacation next year.

### Shanghai Youth Basketball Division A Tournament

Shanghai Youth Sweeps Blue Black Yesterday

In last night's four Shanghai Youth basketball games, except for the national light third team's win over the China United Association, which was relatively close, the victories of the light solid team over the light clear team, the cloud team over the immersion association, and the Shanghai Youth team over the Blue Black team in Division A were all one-sided. The score of the light solid team's win over the light clear team was seventy to six, with the light clear team only scoring three points in each half, a huge disparity. Sun Huipu, Li Zude, Qiu Xiaoci, and Chen Jiali of the Shanghai Youth team were the most active, scoring repeatedly. The Blue Black team was weaker, with only Sun Duansheng and Tao Zunan making some contributions. The Shanghai Youth team had an absolute advantage in the first half with a score of 40 to 13.

### This Year's Cross Country Running Is Desolate

The cross-country season has already begun. Chinese cross-country teams, such as Huizhen, Hongkou, Lidu, Youqiang, and Qingguang, are all preparing to compete. However, this 1939-40 cross-country season seems to be more desolate than last year, and the number of participants is decreasing day by day. Cross-country teams such as Sanguang, Qingqing, Dongguang, and Nanguang have successively disbanded, while various Western organizations have already started practicing to compete with Chinese organizations. As for the Junior Cup team cross-country championship, which will be held this weekend, with a distance of 4.5 miles, although eight teams have signed up to participate, Dongguang and Nanguang have recently requested to withdraw, so only six teams will participate, which is less than the original number of teams, and it has been decided to stop holding it. As for the annual All Shanghai Chinese and Western Open Seven Mile Team Cross-country Championship, it is scheduled to be held on January 14 next spring. It was found that 18 teams participated in the competition this spring, creating an unprecedented grand occasion for cross-country running. It is predicted that the number of participants in this year's competition will be less than -2 teams. In addition, there is also the eye-catching 26 mile 385 yard official marathon championship, which will be completed in mid-May next year. At this time, various teams have successively disbanded, and it is feared that participants will not be enthusiastic. At this time, the cold wind is blowing, which is the best time for cross-country athletes to practice. It is hoped that the teams that have disbanded will reorganize and regroup, or form new teams, so that this year's cross-country season may maintain a vigorous atmosphere.

### Empty Accounts Offset by Hong Kong Group, Foreign Exchange Affected

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC official rate showed no change. The unofficial market for British and American exchanges was flat, but the trend was difficult to sustain. Both morning and evening saw a tightening trend, mainly due to speculators and those with short positions reluctantly covering their positions, which had a significant impact. Foreign exchange firms had very few selling customers, and favorable Japanese and foreign firms were actively buying. Additionally, the noticeable Hong Kong group was also searching for opportunities to buy, making it difficult for the market to escape the tightening trend. At noon, British gold tightened to 4 pence, or 4.0625, and the American exchange rate reached 7.125 yuan, with a few transactions taking place. However, the market seemed to stabilize slightly at the close. In the early afternoon, Chinese merchants continued to cover their positions, and Japanese firms also bought long-term contracts, leading to a resurgence of the tightening trend. Later, a certain American firm showed a stronger selling intention, and the Hong Kong group suddenly resumed selling, so the market slightly returned to a flat state.

### Temporary Stabilization in the Middle

In the early morning, London's large contracts, both near-term and long-term, rose by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold prices remained unchanged. Exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The American exchange rate against British currency increased by 1.625, against Shanghai currency remained unchanged, and against French currency increased by 8.75. The central government's official rates for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 4 pence 59375 and American exchange at 7.53125 yuan, compared to the previous close, British currency was flat and American currency loosened by 0.0625, due to the continued increase in exchange rates. After the opening, a sudden surge of buying orders from Hong Kong and a surprisingly weak supply from foreign exchange firms caused the market to tighten immediately. By 9:15 AM, British gold had tightened to 4.5 pence, and the American exchange rate had softened to 7.3125 yuan, with very few transactions taking place at the higher prices. Fortunately, Chinese merchants came to sell slightly,

The Performing Arts World: Li Duokui and Sun Futing's Arrival in Shanghai Creates a Shortage of Older Male Roles in the North 
Zhibai

The roles of older women in Beijing opera have always been highly valued. After Gong Yunfu, the most famous older female impersonators in the North were Wo Yun Jushi, Song Jie Mei, and Li Duokui. Among the three, Wo Yun was considered the best in terms of artistry. Although Duokui had a good voice, he lacked stage presence and was not considered a complete performer. Wo Yun had a long-term collaboration with Yan Jupeng a few years ago, but he retired due to ill health and never returned to the stage. Jie Mei died of illness a few years ago, so by choosing the best of what was left, Duokui became the only remaining talented older female impersonator.

Speaking of older male roles, Luo Fushan was a strong performer in this area some years ago. After Fushan's death, the only person who could somewhat fill the void was Wen Liangchen, who was from the same lineage as Futing. Liangchen was Yan Qiu's right-hand man, and Nanting was a good match for Mei Lanfang and Xun Huisheng. This person was highly valued by major stars in the Northern Peking opera scene, partly because of his rarity. Last year, Liangchen died in the old capital, so Yan Qiu, considering the older male role to be very important, quietly negotiated with Futing to collaborate. Thus, Futing succeeded Liangchen as Yan Qiu's right-hand man. In addition, Xun Huisheng, Wang Yurong, and other troupes all partnered with Futing. Therefore, although Futing was not as famous as Duokui in Beijing, he occupied a very important position.

Last month, Li Duokui came south to perform at the Xingen Stage at the invitation of its management and Sun Futing also came to Shanghai with Wang Yurong. The almost exclusive pair of older female role actors from the North came south one after another, resulting in the shortage of older female impersonators in the Northern theatrical world.

It is said that Cheng Yanqiu has not been posting the old male part on the theater billboard because of the departure of Futing. Xun Huisheng only performs old plays to get by. In addition, the role of She Taijun in the grand charity play "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" was originally filled by Li Duokui. Due to Li's departure to Shanghai, Ma Fulu cross-dressed to replace him. This situation is quite pitiful. In recent years, the opera world has seen a surge of talent, but the older female role category has consistently failed to produce successors. It is said that Shi Shibao, a fifth-generation student of the Fu Liancheng school, has some talent, but he is the only one. I can't help but worry about the future of the older female role category.

### The Final Decision of "China Travel"
Hua

-- The performance period in collaboration with the Xuan Palace has not been determined

Regarding the backstage of the Xuan Palace and the future of "China Travel", the news in the past two days has been constantly changing and unpredictable. The "Art World Miscellany" was very accurate when it was written the day before yesterday, but it changed again yesterday. - However, this time the change is probably a foregone conclusion.

When the Shanghai Drama and Art Society and the Xuan Palace decided not to renew their contract, the Xuan Palace and "China Travel" once had discussions, but Tang Huaiqiu did not agree. It is true that he thought of coming to Shanghai to prepare for a long-term performance, but why was he unwilling to cooperate even though he had a venue? There is a reason for this. Because Tang Huaiqiu and the people from the Drama and Art Society are all old friends, he could not take over the backstage of the Drama and Art Society out of personal feelings. Therefore, in the "Art World Miscellany" the day before yesterday, I said that cooperating with a certain film company was more likely.

The night before yesterday, Wu Bangfan of the Xuan Palace invited Tang Huaiqiu to dinner. As a result of the dinner, the negotiations were very close. Except for the details of the contract, there were probably no problems. However, "China Travel" now is not as it was when it returned from the North, when everything was in hand and could be staged immediately. Now, there must be at least a short period of preparation before it can meet the audience it has been separated from for a long time on the stage. Therefore, after Zhang Wenjuan's two-week performance period, the Xuan Palace may have to find other entertainment to fill in temporarily.

The Playwright in the "Mirror of China" (3) -- Miscellaneous Memories by the Plum Blossom Border (7)
Li Feishu

The luggage of the passengers was arranged in a row on a wooden counter. At this time, I felt that I was too unlucky! Because the customs officer standing inside the wooden counter where my luggage was placed was a fierce-looking and terrifying person! When I handed him my camera very kindly, hoping that he could put a "permit to travel" tag on it, who knew that after glancing at it askance, he simply ignored me. He had nothing to say except for "legal regulations". Although I stood there with my hands down, showing a "cautious and obedient" attitude to the fullest extent, he remained unmoved.

I was carrying an ancient zither [Ancient Lute]. In order to protect it carefully, I had a felt cover on the outside of the zither case. Who knew that this would arouse his suspicion! Although I explained it in many ways, his suspicion was only slightly reduced in the end. I had to take off the cover and open the case, revealing the black wood. He also tapped on my zither several times with his fingers, fearing that I might be hiding secret documents inside. He even searched and checked the felt cover of my zither case again and again.

Then he opened a suitcase -- this was the one I used on the ship during my travels. All the outerwear and underwear were carefully inspected one by one! The procedure was extremely cumbersome, and the time spent was even longer! At this time, I looked back at the lucky passengers who were being inspected at the same time as me, and they were already sitting comfortably in the carriages. I could see very clearly from outside the car window that the "time" I was going through was really too difficult!

At that time, a few more "mighty and imposing" men came. Some of them were the customs officials who had just finished inspecting the luggage of other passengers. They surrounded me like a woman's earrings. How many people were there in total? I couldn't count them clearly. At this time, my heart was frightened, and I really didn't know what to do!

A tall man pointed to my "tin" box and asked, "What's inside?" And he wanted to inspect it! Because I was afraid of rummaging through the box and damaging the souvenirs that my Chinese friends had given me on this trip, I had opened the previous boxes myself. This "tin" box, because there were too many clothes inside, I was afraid that the "pressure" would damage the box and expose the clothes, so I tied it very firmly with rope. Who knew that this would arouse the suspicion of the customs officer again, and he insisted on opening it.

### After Watching "Dodder Vine" Reflections
Nonghua

I saw the performance of the "Dodder Vine" by the China Youth Theater Company on the second night after its premiere. The plot content of the first act depicts a wealthy housewife who, because she has a considerate husband and a governess who is willing to do anything for her, develops a laziness where she only knows how to use her mouth but not her hands. In the second act, her brother returns from the North to see her and tries to save her upon seeing her state. He also develops feelings for the governess because he sees that she is kind, gentle, and hardworking. In the third act, the housewife resents her brother's interference and sees that he and the governess are becoming increasingly close. If their relationship succeeds, she will lose her reliance on household labor. Therefore, she tries in every way to leave and obstruct their relationship. Finally, she also discovers that her husband and the governess are having an affair. It is because of the power dynamic that she is awakened from her laziness. The implication is that rather than having the governess be close to her husband, she should be diligent herself, dismiss the governess, and help her brother and the governess get married, achieving a win-win situation and reducing a lot of trouble.

Overall, the performance of the play seems like a comedy on the surface. The translation of the script is quite enjoyable for the audience because it is colloquial and relaxed. In reality, the play is very satirical. There are countless women like the female protagonist, Mrs. Wu, especially housewives in today's society. Even in general wealthy families in Shanghai, most are like this. As a result, various complex disputes arise in families, and I think wives cannot completely shirk their responsibility.

The performance of the China Youth Theater Company's "Dodder Vine" is quite successful in satirizing the laziness of general housewives in society. The translation of the script is also quite colloquial and is aimed at criticizing the laziness of women in real society. As for the acting skills of the actors, such as Pan Xianglin as Wu Huaquan, Lu Naili as Mrs. Wu, Zhuo Chaoran as Bao En'yan, and Chen Hong as Miss Zhou, they all have excellent theatrical talents. However, the play has not been rehearsed for long, and the actors' lines and expressions are not yet proficient and experienced. It is hoped that they will continue to work hard.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden
Xu Muyun

Furthermore, Rong Si is a descendant of an internal affairs minister from the late Qing Dynasty. Unfortunately, he spends all his time messing around outside. It can be said that he knows the outside but not the inside. As for Zhong Si, he is the son of an official posted to an outer province. However, he not only knows the inside but can also excavate the treasures hidden underground in his house. Looking at it this way, the behaviors of these two descendants happen to be completely inversely proportional to the titles of their ancestors' official positions.

Guan Dayuan Excels in Performing Old Plays Such as "Yong'an Palace" and "Hanyang Yuan"

Guan Dayuan, who is as qualified as Shu Yan in learning from Tan Xinpei, will soon come south to perform at the Xingen Theater. I have described his history before. Now, I would like to introduce to drama enthusiasts the old plays that he specializes in and which have been lost for a long time. From this, one can also see that his knowledge of drama is extensive and not just empty fame. He cannot be compared to those who can only perform a few popular old Sheng plays.

(1) Yong'an Palace. The "Crying Spirit Tablet" was originally called "Yong'an Palace." Its use in "Lianying Village" started with Tan Xinpei. The first half of the play is called "Little Peach Garden." It starts with the First Lord sending troops, Guan Xing and Zhang Bao competing for the vanguard seal, and the oath of alliance. It includes Guan and Zhang returning to camp to celebrate their victory, the First Lord speaking recklessly and angering the veteran Huang Zhong, Huang Zhong breaking into the Wu army and being surrounded by arrows, Guan and Zhang going to his aid, and Huang Zhong returning to camp. The First Lord deeply mourns and personally takes the arrow for him on several occasions. (If it is performed by an old martial Sheng, then Huang Zhong is the protagonist, and the play is renamed "Attack on Eastern Wu.") It continues until Guan Gong appears, cuts Pan and obtains the sword, sacrifices to Guan and Zhang, burns the connected camps, and Zhao Yun saves the emperor. There are many scenes, and the cast must be complete to be worth seeing. (Note: Old Tan added two sections of "Fan Xipi" during the sacrifice. The original play lacked them.) (157)

### Comintern Advises Romania and Turkey to Sign Mutual Assistance Treaties with the Soviet Union

Moscow – The Comintern's organ, the "Communist" newspaper, yesterday advised Romania and Turkey to sign mutual assistance treaties with the Soviet Union. The newspaper stated that "British and French imperialism" is now planning to drag the Turkish capital into the war, and pointed out that Romania, surrounded by Anglo-American capitalism, has been harming ethnic minorities in Bessarabia and other places. This situation, it said, "is absolutely intolerable to the Soviet Union. In order to fulfill its obligations, the Soviet Union will provide assistance to the oppressed ethnic minorities in that region." The newspaper concluded by calling on the Romanian Communist Party to form a united front to attack the war provocateurs of British and French imperialism. The newspaper claimed that France intends to establish a new anti-German front in the Balkans. (United Press dispatch from the 7th)

London – A dispatch from the Daily Telegraph's correspondent, Steanpole, stated that German propaganda has recently claimed that after the end of the Finnish war, Romania's Bessarabia and India will be coveted by the Soviet Union. Official circles here have not commented on this propaganda. It is generally believed that the German-Soviet treaty not only contains secret understandings regarding the Soviet Union's expansion of power in the Baltic Sea, but also includes the Soviet Union's predetermined plans in the Balkans. The Soviet Union's threat to Bessarabia is indeed considered very serious. According to Steanpole's general opinion, Germany is now constantly encouraging the Soviet Union to take action in the Balkans as soon as possible, but this threat does not cause panic here. Although Turkey is doing its best to maintain friendly relations with both the Soviet Union and Germany, its determination to defend the Balkans has become increasingly firm. As for the claim that the Soviet Union will extend its ambitions as far as India, people here generally do not believe it, but they say that this possibility is permissible, so it is necessary to prepare for the worst. (Reuters dispatch from the 7th)

### Finnish Embassy to Soviet Union Withdrawn Last Night

Moscow – The Finnish Minister to the Soviet Union and 29 embassy staff members are expected to receive their passports today. They are scheduled to depart from Moscow at 8:50 PM, via Berlin, to the Swedish capital. The head of the diplomatic corps in the Soviet Union, German Ambassador Schulenburg, has suggested to the embassies and legations of neutral countries other than the American embassy that no one be sent to the station to see the Finnish Minister off, as this action would be an expression of anti-Soviet sentiment. (Reuters dispatch from the 7th)

### Polish Submarines Join the British Fleet

London – Two Polish submarines, the "Wilk" and the "Orzeł", have escaped from the Baltic Sea and joined the British Navy. The "Wilk" was in Gdynia when Poland was invaded, and later took refuge in Tallinn, from which it then escaped. (Reuters dispatch from the 7th)

### German Diplomatic Activities

Rome – Prime Minister Mussolini met with Dr. Ley, the leader of the German Labor Front, who was invited to visit Rome, for one hour last night. (Reuters dispatch from the 7th)

Istanbul – German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, suddenly visited the Turkish Parliament yesterday and called on Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu. The Turkish Foreign Minister received him in his private office in the Parliament. The content of their conversation is unknown. (United Press dispatch from the 7th)

### The Grandeur of the British King's Troop Inspection at the Front

London – A Reuters correspondent with the British forces in France, in a dispatch from a certain location in France, stated that the concentration of troops within the British defense line during the British King's inspection of the Expeditionary Force yesterday was unprecedented since the start of the war. The King traveled 80 miles by car, and at each place he visited, thousands of British soldiers stood in orderly ranks, a stark contrast to the dispersed soldiers at noon. Airplanes patrolled the sky for protection. The King entered a British Air Force airfield and inspected it for a week. A prepared aircraft, on the King's command, took off in 30 seconds via wireless telephone. The King also spoke with the fighter pilot who shot down the first German aircraft in France, praising his achievement. (Reuters dispatch from the 7th)

Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has intercepted a total of 476,000 tons of contraband, and France has intercepted a total of 200,000 tons, totaling 676,000 tons. (Havas dispatch from the 6th)

London – First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, giving a detailed explanation of the recent naval war situation, in place of Prime Minister Chamberlain's weekly report. The speech praised the British Navy's defense against German submarines as extremely effective, and the economic blockade of Germany by Britain and France as having a very significant effect. He said, "The enemy's main targets of attack are our navy and overseas trade, that is, the very survival of the British Isles and the British Empire. In terms of overseas trade, we have more than 2,000 ships constantly sailing in all seas, and 100 to 150 ships entering and leaving British ports every day. Such a large shipping enterprise must be maintained, and defending against the constant attacks of German submarines is a matter of urgency for our country. Although Germany participated in the convention on civilized warfare, it disregards this convention when conducting submarine warfare. In addition, Germany sometimes uses aircraft to attack our ships, and widely lays mines in all seas. Until recently, they have even used aircraft or submarines to place magnetic mines near our ports, with the aim of destroying British and neutral countries' commerce. Not only that, but two German pocket battleships and one cruiser have been engaged in piracy in the North and South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean off the coast of Madagascar for several weeks. All of this will have an adverse effect on our shipping industry, and the Admiralty's duty lies in protecting it and detaining German ships and cargo in all seas, thereby eliminating the country's overseas trade. Regarding the defense against German submarines, I have reported to the House of Commons that our navy can sink an average of one to four enemy submarines per week. This estimate is consistent with the actual situation. In short, the destruction rate of German submarines is actually higher than their construction rate. Even in the past week, German submarines have been quite active, but our destroyer fleet, with the assistance of the air force, has defended effectively. I also believe that five German submarines were sunk in one week, not including those sunk by the French Navy. We are now building a large number of warships dedicated to defending against submarines in our home waters, the number of which is three times more than the increase in the early stages of the war. They can be incorporated into the fleet next year, which is a source of great comfort to the people of our country. For this reason, although some losses overseas are inevitable in the future, the situation will definitely improve day by day, which I firmly believe. As for the more than one thousand merchant ships that we have armed to strengthen our defenses, apart from large auxiliary ships, we will soon have as many as one thousand of these armed merchant ships. In addition, the methods of detecting submarines have greatly improved compared to before, and the merchant ship escort system has been fully implemented. Few escorted merchant ships are attacked; on average, only one ship is sunk out of every 750. German submarines, knowing that it is not easy to attack British merchant ships, have turned to attacking merchant ships of neutral countries. In October of this year, the losses of British merchant ships were only half of those in September; in November, the losses decreased even further, only one-third of those in October. Although the losses of merchant ships of neutral countries decreased by half in October compared to September, the losses in November were on par with those in September. Germany abandons the navigation of its enemy country and attacks the navigation industry of neutral countries; this kind of combat method is rather strange, from which it can be seen that the friendship of Germany is more venomous than its hatred. The magnetic mine is not a new and mysterious thing; the method of manufacturing it was originally known to us, and we had secretly planned countermeasures before this type of mine was first discovered in British territorial waters. However, it would be an overstatement to say that dealing with this latest means of the Nazi Party is very easy. Regarding this, I will be able to report news to you again during the Christmas holidays. As for the situation of blockading German export trade, this is a retaliatory measure taken by Britain and France against Germany's indiscriminate attacks on merchant ships of neutral countries. Neutral countries will not suffer any significant obstacles as a result. German export goods are now piled up in the country's ports, docks, and warehouses in countless numbers, all because they cannot be shipped out. The country's import goods are also unable to be unloaded as a result. The German side claims that its navy can control all the oceans, which is an exaggeration. When we started the war, we had a total of 21 million tons of merchant ships, and the losses we have suffered in the past three months are only 340,000 tons." (Havas dispatch from the 6th)

### Dutch Response to German Accusations

The Hague – Since Britain and France have intensified their implementation of blockade policies, the German government issued a communique yesterday accusing the Netherlands of failing to arm its merchant ships or dispatch warships to escort its merchant ships. The Dutch government recently issued a communique this month defending itself, stating, "The accusations in the German communique are limited to the Netherlands. Why are Italy, Japan, and Norway not mentioned? In reality, if the Netherlands were to act according to German wishes, it would inevitably go to war with Britain and France. The Netherlands does not care whether this is what Germany wants. But does neutrality impose an obligation of armed resistance on Italy, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, and other countries? Our answer remains that this obligation does not exist. Moreover, if the Netherlands were to act according to German wishes, it would also have to resist with force the German submarine attacks, the harassment of merchant ships, and the prolonged obstruction of the navigation of its own ships in the Baltic Sea. For example, our oil tanker "[unclear]" was sunk by a German submarine on the 25th of last month while sailing from one neutral country's port to another neutral country's port. This city [unclear] country [unclear] shall publicly [unclear] with the most [unclear] of the shallowest humanism, and must be resisted with force." (Havas dispatch from the 7th)
