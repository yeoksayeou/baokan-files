### Japanese Air Force Continues to Ravage the Route Between Shiqi and Macau; Foreign News Agency Reporters Inspect Various Places and See Chinese Volunteers Building Roads and Maintaining Order

(Guangzhou) According to reports here this morning, the Japanese authorities suddenly announced the closure of the Pearl River for ten days on Friday of last week for "military reasons." As a result, the regular Japanese commercial ships and British gunboats between Guangzhou and Macau could not enter the Pearl River. A special correspondent from the Haitian News Agency, who was originally on his way to Macau for inspection, had to take the land route, passing through Shiqi to Macau. He personally saw that although the area he passed through was directly outside Guangzhou, it was not occupied by Japanese troops but maintained order by Chinese volunteers. Some volunteers were building roads, while others patrolled the various canals surrounding the entire Zhongshan County. They were busy with their work, and the order was well maintained. The residents showed friendliness to foreigners. There are regular small boats between Shiqi and Macau, maintaining transportation, patrolled and supervised by Chinese regular police. The section between Shiqi and Macau is considered the most dangerous part of the journey from Hong Kong to Macau. The Japanese Air Force recklessly strafes cars and buses with machine guns. The reporter personally saw three passengers killed the other day. Therefore, each car has a special observer who specializes in looking at the sky. As soon as he sees a Japanese plane approaching, he reports to the driver to avoid it. According to rumors here, the reason why the Japanese authorities closed the Pearl River is because Japanese warships in the Pearl River are moving south. For example, seven Japanese transport ships sailed south from the Pearl River via Macau the other day. (Haitian News Agency, 7th Dispatch)

Editorial

### Chamberlain's Statement on Aiding France: A Forward-Looking Perspective

"Aggression must extend to weak points; peace relies on the guarantee of military strength."

This is truly a philosophy filled with bloodshed, exposing bestiality, and a theory that abandons heavenly principles and contradicts human morality. It should be disdained by wise thinkers and deeply abhorred by morally upright individuals. However, the level of civilization of general humanity has not improved for a long time, remaining stuck at the current stage and being dominated by this theory. Those who disregard this theory often suffer the consequences; those who measure all real-world problems with this theory rarely fail. The contradiction between knowledge and action has reached such an extreme. Are we, the people of the world, who usually consider ourselves rational animals, not greatly ridiculous! The distant need not be discussed. China, for a long time under the watchful eyes of a tiger, believed that the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty could provide protection, and was thus trampled by foreign powers. This is an example of suffering the consequences of disregarding the philosophy of bloodshed. Italy crossed the sea and desert to take Abyssinia, and Germany annexed the Czech Republic and Austria. These are clear examples of aggression towards weak points. Autocratic countries see democratic countries with multiple parties, litigiousness, greed for wealth, and fear of war as weak. The German-Italian axis sees the loose alliance between Britain and France as weak. Italy sees France's declining birth rate as weak. Thus, they roll up their sleeves, brandish their fists, and sharpen their knives, making endless demands. If democratic countries remain as weak and disorganized as before, and continue to naively believe in promises and lip service diplomacy, then they will either have to submit obediently or hastily engage in war. The global situation is unpredictable. Fortunately, the lesson in the Munich classroom was a real-life demonstration, directly instructing and admonishing. Thus, the philosophy of bloodshed was annotated as iron, and world affairs began their transformation.

How did the transformation come about? It came about because each country enacted its unprecedented military expenditure budget. The United States rushed to build a large number of military aircraft for Britain and France. France expressed its determination not to cede an inch of territory. The Soviet Union expressed its respect for the Franco-Soviet Pact. Mr. Roosevelt expressed that he would definitely help democratic countries. And as of yesterday, the British Prime Minister, the gentle and venerable Mr. Chamberlain, made a simple, clear, resolute, and forceful statement in the Lower House: Britain will not ask where the threat to France comes from and will go to its aid with all its strength. Such a statement is not only a creative work in the life of a 70-year-old man but also a page in international political history that should be prominently recorded and be epoch-making after the European War. Prior to this, Britain and France, either responding to each other, or having a tacit understanding, or having reached an agreement, had common interests in survival, so their relationship was inseparable. However, there were those who believed that Britain and France were not so close, and they tried to drive a wedge between them through diplomatic means. Prior to this: Britain and France were not prepared for war, but if there were a war, they would advance together. However, there were those who still believed that the war was for France, and Britain would not fight for France. Therefore, they showed goodwill to Britain in diplomacy, while trying to isolate France and make it the sole object of attack on military grounds. Prior to this: Some feared that the war would drag on, and Britain might eventually help France, but in the initial stages of the war, Britain would remain aloof, leaving room for diplomatic maneuvering. In terms of strategy, the key was to strike France and defeat it in one fell swoop. But with Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement as of yesterday, the divisions between diplomacy and military affairs were clearly demarcated, leaving no room for doubt. And the British and French front was consolidated, and even strengthened. As a result, the situation in Europe changed, no longer allowing for unilateral posturing. According to the philosophy of bloodshed, peace has been strengthened by one guarantee.

From now on, if there is no war, then so be it; if there is a war, it will be a great war. This has long been a common understanding among the people of the world, but autocratic countries, in addition to their lofty ambitions, have only now begun to recognize it, and only now are willing to recognize it. Because of this, in the past few days, the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was emphasized, focusing on complex diplomatic maneuvers, calculating friends and enemies. In the future, the work of the General Staff will be emphasized, focusing on planning strategies and estimating gains and losses. If the scope of gains and losses is limited to France and Italy, then military strength, material resources, personnel, and the overall situation each have their strengths and weaknesses. If the scope is Germany and Italy versus Britain and France, or even larger, then the entire picture changes. At the very least, it can be said that Germany and Italy are not as durable as Britain and France. Moreover, Germany does not really want to fight!

With such a situation, who would place a lone bet? I do not believe that a war is inevitable. However, there are still unknowns: Dictatorial regimes are based on establishing merit and prestige. This is the main factor driving militarism and is a cause for concern. Italy is close to the tropics, and its national character is emotional and impetuous. Moreover, it has been tempered by years of propaganda about grand achievements and disregard for others. This is the second cause for concern. In the Spanish Civil War, with the help of Italy, the victory is gradually being decided, and the front line is advancing towards the French border. Possible accidents are difficult to prevent, and planned provocations are also intended. This is the third cause for concern. Last September, Germany achieved a surprising victory over the Czech Republic. Italy was also quick to take action, spending a considerable amount of resources. There was likely an agreement that Germany had to repay the favor. This is the fourth cause for concern. Although the causes for concern are as such, the reasons against war are so great. It remains to be seen how Mr. Mussolini will wield his great diplomatic skills, prevent the causes for concern, avoid the reckless bet of war, and achieve honorable achievements in peace!

### Japanese Order Foreigners in Guling to Leave by a Deadline

Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi Province has been continuously shelling Guling since the 3rd of this month. However, the Chinese army's defensive works have not been damaged at all. Because the Japanese army is attacking upwards, the shells they fire cannot reach their targets. The Japanese side notified the various foreign consulates on the 6th of this month, giving them until the 10th of this month to evacuate the residents of their respective countries on Guling, and threatened to launch a general attack on the Chinese army on the mountain from that day. However, the Chinese army has already built extremely strong defensive works and stored six months' worth of food. If the Japanese army dares to invade, it will surely fail. There are currently a total of 65 foreigners remaining on the mountain, including 37 British, 12 Americans, 9 Germans, and 7 other foreigners. (7th Quick News Agency Dispatch)

Hankou: According to the Japanese military authorities here, there are still 65 foreigners in Guling. The Japanese consulate in Shanghai has notified the countries concerned, giving them until February 10 to withdraw. After the foreigners have withdrawn, the Japanese army will immediately begin a general attack. According to Japanese estimates, there are still about 5,000 Chinese troops on Guling. (7th Quick News Agency Dispatch)

Hankou: The American gunboat Oahu is scheduled to depart from here at 9:00 AM tomorrow for Jiujiang. British Vice-Consul Eckersley and American Vice-Consul Davis will both be on board, it is reported that the ship will remain stationed in Jiujiang, to await the clarification of the situation in Guling, as the Japanese authorities have warned the foreigners in the mountains to evacuate. According to sources here, although instructions from the British and American governments regarding the evacuation of refugees from Guling have not yet been received, it is reported that the total evacuation of foreigners from Guling is a practical impossibility. The reason given is that most of the residents of Guling are elderly, and it is difficult to implement their hasty departure from the mountains. It is now reported that the Japanese side is considering this new situation. At present, although the British gunboat Petrel is still unable to make contact with Guling, news from the mountains indicates that all foreigners are safe and sound. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

### German Newspaper Reporter Observes the Sino-Japanese War; Japan's Financial and Material Resources Are Exhausted; Military Victory Has Become a Delusion

Berlin: The Frankfurter Zeitung recently published a telegram from its Tokyo correspondent, commenting on the situation after the resignation of former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro. It said that Konoe proposed peace terms, but the Chinese government refused to discuss them. As a result, Konoe himself suffered a fatal blow and had to resign. The Sino-Japanese War has also entered a new stage as a result. The so-called new stage, on the Japanese side, means that "the Sino-Japanese situation has shifted from large-scale military operations to permanent occupation and suppression of guerrillas. Only by suppressing guerrillas and permanently securing the occupied areas can a way be found to establish a certain state, and then economic development can be planned." The success of this depends on how the Hiranuma Cabinet manages it. The cabinet still hopes to crush Chinese resistance and make it recognize Japan's position, but it also knows that the deeper the Japanese army goes, the less it will gain compared to occupying several important cities and strategic strongholds. For this reason, the Japanese military authorities have also recognized that the plan to open the Guangdong-Macau road to connect the Japanese troops in Hankou and Guangzhou is not necessary. Conversely, although peace cannot be established, it is eager to consolidate its strength in the occupied areas. However, this also requires a great deal of effort, because Japan's financial and material resources are limited. The current wartime economic policy must continue to be implemented, and the National Mobilization Law must be fully implemented to alleviate its poverty. (7th Havas Dispatch)

### The Chinese War of Resistance is Growing - A Commentary from *Pravda*

Moscow - The *Pravda* newspaper of Moscow recently published an article titled "The New China is Growing," stating that "China's war of resistance against foreign invaders, striving for national liberation, has entered its second phase. Japan's last attempt to encircle and annihilate China's main forces in Wuhan has completely failed. The Chinese army has increased in size, and its combat effectiveness has been infinitely strengthened. The 4,000-mile long battle line has made it difficult for Japan to advance. When the Japanese army reaches the mountainous areas, it can no longer coordinate the movements of the entire army. The Chinese army is now rapidly developing economic base areas in the Northwest and Southwest, preparing for a decisive counter-offensive. The brave Chinese people have unanimously risen up to fight for national liberation. In this process, they have greatly strengthened their political activities. The unity between the Chinese army and the people has become increasingly consolidated, and the foundation for long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has become increasingly strong. The Kuomintang's recent expulsion of pro-Japanese elements from the party was supported by the people of the whole country and was a very significant event, proving that the Kuomintang has resolutely decided to eliminate internal reactionaries and enter a new stage of the war of liberation."

### Japanese Oppression of the Taiwanese and Korean People - Exploiting Wealth for Military Expenses, Enlisting Young Men as Cannon Fodder

Tokyo - During yesterday's debate on the budget bill in the House of Representatives, a member of the Minseitō party, Nakajima, inquired about the attitudes of Korea and Taiwan towards the Sino-Japanese War. The spokesman for the Governor-General of Korea replied as follows: "The Korean people have now fully understood the great significance of the Sino-Japanese War and the Far Eastern situation and have completely abandoned the independence movement or communist conspiracies. Last year, 400 Korean volunteers joined the Korean army, and another 600 will enlist this year. The frugality movement in the area has been quite effective. Korean people's bank deposits have reached 200 million yen, and donations to the national defense fund total 6 million yen. There are also 64 airplanes." The spokesman for the Governor-General of Taiwan then replied, detailing how the Taiwanese people have been thoroughly Japanized, saying that "80% of the Taiwanese natives came from Fujian, and 20% came from Guangdong. In the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, many rumors circulated among some Taiwanese people, saying that China would defeat Japan, or that Japan would be attacked by other countries. However, these rumors have now been completely eliminated. The Taiwanese people are now quite proud to be people of the Japanese Empire and to participate in the Sino-Japanese War. Some Taiwanese who died in battle in China were given honorable state funerals by the Emperor, just like the Japanese people. The frugality movement in Taiwan is progressing smoothly. The original target of 50 million yen has long been exceeded. The national defense funds contributed by the Taiwanese people have reached 7 million yen, including over 10,000 aborigines who sold gold worth 30 million yen to the Japanese government."

### Negotiations on Qingdao's Refusal to Issue Licenses Have Not Been Successful

London - The British House of Commons inquired yesterday about the Japanese authorities' implementation of export license measures. Conservative MP Morgen asked what measures the British Prime Minister Chamberlain had taken regarding the Japanese authorities in Qingdao refusing to allow the export of goods from foreign banks that provided financial facilities in Chinese currency. Undersecretary Butler replied that in recent months, the Japanese authorities in Qingdao had refused to issue export licenses, either for the reasons stated by Morgen or without stating any reasons. The British Consul-General in Qingdao has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side has used military necessity as an excuse and has not been successful. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has also negotiated with the Japanese government on this matter. Morgen then asked whether this refusal to issue export licenses had been extended to other ports in China. Butler replied that this method has recently been extended to Weihaiwei and Yantai, and the British government is closely monitoring it. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### It Is Necessary to Improve the Burma Road to Yunnan

London - Conservative MP Peter Macdonald asked in the House of Commons yesterday whether the Burmese government was supporting the improvement of the existing road to the border of Yunnan Province in China, and if not, whether it could be made into a modern standard road, as it would be a trade route to the Far East. Undersecretary of State for India, Lieutenant Colonel Muirhead, replied that the Burmese government had built this road from Lashio to the Chinese border, which is 120 miles long, and the project is sturdy and can be used regardless of the weather. Subsequent construction is underway as the road develops. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### Japanese Small Political Groups Forming a Party - Contains Fascist Overtones

Tokyo - Local political figures say that small political groups within the Japanese parliament will come together to form a new political party. After its formation, the party will occupy 60 to 70 seats in the parliament. Its platform is to promote national and social reform and advocate a positive and strong strategy towards China, with military and diplomatic activities going hand in hand. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

Hong Kong - Eight councilors, including Zhang Yilin, who stayed in Hong Kong, flew to Chongqing this morning to attend a meeting. The meeting is scheduled to open on the 12th and will last for ten days. (Special dispatch from 1:00 AM on the 8th)

### Rumor Says Pearl River Shipping is About to Open

Guangzhou - According to reliable sources, the restrictions temporarily imposed on shipping on the Pearl River due to "military operations on the Pearl River" will be lifted on February 10th. It is said that the flagship of the US South China Patrol Fleet, the USS Mindanao, will sail from here to Hong Kong on that day. It is said that after the temporary ban on navigation is lifted, Japanese ships will resume services between Macau and Guangzhou. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Hong Kong - The recent arrival of the Japanese ship "Zuisan Maru" (phonetic) in Guangzhou has attracted great attention in shipping circles here. The Japanese continue to blockade the Pearl River, which shows their intention to monopolize trade in South China. British ships in Guangzhou are still being detained by the Japanese. British shipping officials have asked the British Consul in Guangzhou to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

### The Soviet Union Uses Diplomatic Tactics to Conclude a Black Sea Pact - Wooing Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria to Participate - Establishing Collective Security to Prevent German Advancement

(Moscow) It is widely rumored in diplomatic circles here that the Soviet diplomatic authorities intend to initiate the conclusion of a Black Sea Pact, based on the three countries bordering the Black Sea, namely Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. In addition, although Greece is not on the Black Sea coast, it should also be invited to participate. Bulgaria originally harbored the desire to "restore its homeland" from Romania. If the establishment of the Black Sea Pact makes it more likely for Bulgaria to realize this desire in the future, it will naturally be happy to join, provided that the country's aspirations are reduced to a minimum. It has recently been heard that the Soviet diplomatic authorities are conducting explorations to clarify whether there is hope for the realization of this plan. Generally speaking, the Soviet government advocates establishing a collective security system centered on the Black Sea, in order to prevent Germany from advancing further. It is still unclear whether the Soviet government has made this proposal to the countries concerned. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### The Anglo-French Cooperation Declaration - Rome Feels Uneasy - Believes It Has the Nature of a Military Alliance - Circles in Berlin Remain Silent

(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding Anglo-French cooperation have shaken Italian political circles, who believe that Chamberlain has expressed a clearer position on the relationship between the Anglo-French treaty than before. Some quarters say that Chamberlain's remarks are equivalent to a declaration of an Anglo-French military alliance, with the same binding force as German Führer Hitler's declaration of the relationship between Germany and Italy. Many political observers believe that the British Prime Minister's remarks have broken Italy's belief that Britain has never given France military assistance. Italian sources believe that French Prime Minister Daladier said after the Munich Agreement that Britain had given such guarantees, which were rejected by Chamberlain, but now Daladier's movement has been successful. Italian officials are unwilling to make criticisms, but say that Italy's natural desire does not harm the military interests of any country. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

(Rome) This morning, all the newspapers here published editorials, trying hard to reduce the value of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain and France would provide each other with military assistance in the event of war. It is said that Britain made these remarks in response to France's pressure, and that their meaning is no different from previous remarks. The newspapers also emphasized that the Prime Minister's remarks were about wars involving Britain and France, not wars in general, and made great efforts to elaborate on this point. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

(Berlin) There has been much silence here regarding British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding Anglo-French cooperation, and no criticism has been made. A spokesman told a Reuters reporter that the Prime Minister's remarks were not new, and that the Prime Minister had given France the same guarantee when the situation in Czechoslovakia was critical. Future events will depend on whether Chamberlain's remarks can strengthen France's attitude. If France's attitude becomes stronger as a result, the existing tension will increase. Some critics have said that Chamberlain's guarantee to France is similar to the guarantee given by Germany to Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### Paris Is Pleased

(Paris) Responsible figures here are very satisfied after British Prime Minister Chamberlain made a speech in the House of Commons, declaring that if France were threatened, "no matter where the threat comes from," it should assist France, and said that up to now, Britain has only agreed to assist France if it is attacked by Germany. According to the speech made by Prime Minister Chamberlain today, if France is threatened in the Pyrenees Mountains, Britain is also obliged to assist it, which is a further indication. In addition, the French government authorities have repeatedly made declarations in the Chamber of Deputies, declaring that France will never give up an inch of land, and Prime Minister Chamberlain has also agreed with this. How Britain is positioned has therefore become completely clear, and this is even more satisfying. In addition, the British and French governments have also been in close contact before Prime Minister Chamberlain issued this statement, asking General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, to provide assurances that he will not allow Italian troops to approach the French border. This also shows the solidarity between Britain and France. After reading the communiqué issued by the Supreme Council of the Italian Fascist Party some days ago, it is known that even after the Spanish Nationalist Army wins, Italian volunteers do not want to withdraw, so that they can have a better chance of success when making demands on France in the future. On the other hand, there is also the saying that the western Spanish island of Menorca in the Mediterranean Sea will be occupied by Italy after Mallorca. If so, then Italy's position in Mallorca will definitely be strengthened, which is a very worrying thing. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### The Soviet Union and Italy Negotiate a Trade Agreement - Raw Materials Exchanged for Industrial Products - Actual Negotiations Have Been Completed

(Rome) The semi-official Italian newspaper *Il Popolo d'Italia* recently reported that trade negotiations between Italy and the Soviet Union have been underway for several weeks, and have actually been completed. The scale of the agreement is the largest in Italy's past trade agreements with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union will supply Italy with heavy oil, manganese, coal, wheat, and wood, and Italy will provide industrial manufactured goods. It is estimated that the annual trade volume between the two sides will increase from 400,000,000 lira to 1,000,000,000 lira, and a barter system will be applied. (Havas, 7th)

### The Interests of Hungarian Nationals in the Soviet Union - Entrusted to Japan for Care

(Moscow) After the Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with Hungary, the staff of the Hungarian Embassy have been ordered to return home. The interests of the country's nationals have been entrusted to the Japanese Embassy for care. Before his departure, Hungarian Minister Ronggert also asked the Japanese Embassy authorities to handle the closing of the Hungarian Embassy. The Japanese Embassy has recently declared that it will temporarily take care of the interests of Hungarian nationals until the diplomatic representative of a third country formally accepts the Hungarian mandate to handle consular affairs. Regarding this matter, it is generally believed that diplomatic representatives of various countries regard this Hungarian mandate as a difficult task. Poland and Hungary maintain friendly relations and could have accepted the Hungarian mandate, but relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have recently improved significantly, and the two sides are conducting negotiations to discuss the signing of a trade agreement. Poland does not want to offend the Soviet Union by taking care of the interests of Hungarian nationals under such circumstances. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### The Lao Hu Kaiwen Store in this City Sells an Effective Hemorrhoid Medicine

The Lao Hu Kaiwen stationery store of Guanghu Clan, located next to Cai Tongde on Henan Road, Baoqiu Field in this city, sells a tested prescription hemorrhoid and fistula pill, which is very effective in treating all new and old hemorrhoids and fistulas in men and women. It is said that this medicine is formulated with a tested ancient prescription, is mild in nature, and works quickly. It has been tested by many patients and has been effective in curing the disease, and the number of people cured is difficult to count. Therefore, it is very different from ordinary hemorrhoid medicines on the market. The main functions of this medicine are to treat hemorrhoids, fistulas, anal swelling and pain, milk-shaped and rooster comb-shaped hemorrhoids, oozing pus, pain or itching, and malignant hemorrhoids such as fistula tubes and pus and blood in the stool can be eradicated as scheduled. The Guanghu Clan's Hu Kaiwen store, opposite the Shangwu Yinshuguan, also sells it and has detailed instructions on file.

### Britain and France Make Contact - Trying to Mediate the Spanish Civil War - Rumors of a Tendency to Recognize the Rebel Government - Peace Terms Rejected by Franco

(Paris) According to news reports, Berat, the unofficial French ambassador to the Nationalist Spanish capital, visited the Nationalist Foreign Minister in Burgos twice yesterday. Today he is heading back to France to meet with French Foreign Minister Bonnet. At the same time, there are rumors that British Minister to Spain Stevenson, French Ambassador Henry, and Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Vayo met in Perpignan. Therefore, the general public believes that this recent development may lead to hope for peace. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

(London) It is claimed here that the British and French governments have now taken steps to try to end the Spanish war. Responsible figures are keeping silent on this matter. Regarding rumors that the Spanish government has asked Britain to intervene and explained to Downing Street the conditions under which the Spanish government is willing to end the war immediately, the authorities here neither deny nor confirm this. London newspapers reported yesterday that Franco rejected any truce conditions, insisting on the unconditional surrender of the government forces. Political figures believe that this news is probably reliable. London is now actively contacting Paris on this matter, trying to avoid further pointless bloodshed. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

Perpignan - Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Vayo met with British Minister Stevenson and French Ambassador Henry this afternoon. Before the meeting, reporters visited British Minister Stevenson at the British Embassy in Amélies-les-Bains. Stevenson denied that Republican Prime Minister Negrín had asked him to discuss peace terms with General Franco, saying that this was contrary to Negrín's declared will to continue the war in central Spain. However, he added, "Since I arrived in Spain in October, I have been trying to find a way to peace. I have not yet discussed this with the Spanish government. Henry and I will meet with Vayo in Perpignan this afternoon. That's all I can say for now." (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

(London) Britain and France once attempted to mediate the Spanish war, but because the conditions were not met by either side, and neither side was willing to surrender, peace hopes have not yet been realized today. Rebel leader General Franco insisted that the government forces surrender unconditionally. Within the Spanish Republican government, opinions are divided into two factions. Republican President Azaña fled to Paris yesterday, advocating unconditional surrender to avoid prolonging the war, but government military officials opposed his proposal. Republican Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Vayo proposed a three-point peace plan, supported the military's proposal, and believed that the war should continue, but this was rejected by Franco. The peace plan proposed by the government military required that all foreign troops in Spain should withdraw first, and then a public vote should be held to determine the future Spanish government, and that an agreement should be concluded by both sides, with no retaliatory actions. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

(London) It is widely rumored here today that the British and French governments will convene a meeting soon to discuss the recent situation in Spain. It is said that London and Paris now both hope to establish diplomatic relations with Franco immediately. The *Daily News* revealed that if the Spanish Nationalist Army government ceases hostilities immediately, Britain will recognize it. An editorial in the *Daily Mail* urged General Miaja not to continue resisting to avoid pointless bloodshed. The newspaper stated, "Britain and France will formally recognize Franco within 24 hours." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

Perpignan - Regarding the French dispatch of a diplomatic representative to Burgos, it is still unknown to the outside world whether it will actually or legally recognize the Franco government. People here point out that if France legally recognizes the Franco government, it will inevitably sever all relations with the Spanish government. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

### British and French Representatives Make Contact - Britain Makes Three Proposals to the Rebel Authorities

(London) Well-informed sources have announced that Sir Robert Hodgson, the British commercial representative stationed in Burgos (the seat of the Nationalist Army government), is scheduled to return to his post within the next week. He will spend a week in Paris on the way, and will talk with British Ambassador to Spain Chilton in Antibes in southern France, before proceeding to Burgos. This trip has three missions: (1) to continue negotiations in the hope of ending the Spanish Civil War; (2) to urge the Nationalist Army government to provide assurances that Italian volunteers will be withdrawn after the end of the civil war; and (3) to suggest to the Nationalist Army government that Britain provide funds to help with reconstruction work. Regarding the first point, General Franco has given British Acting Commercial Representative Coulum a promise that he will avoid bloody retaliatory actions after the end of the civil war. Regarding the second point, France has asked the Nationalist Army government not to allow Italian volunteers to approach the French border, and British Acting Commercial Representative Coulum has also made the same request to the Nationalist Army government, but no answer has been received. It is rumored that the British government intends to send a senior official to Burgos in the near future, whose status is even higher than that of Sir Robert Hodgson, and then formally recognize the Nationalist Army government. Regarding the third point, there are three main conditions for Britain: (a) this loan will be guaranteed by Spanish tariff revenue; (b) the Nationalist Army agrees to send foreign combatants back to their home countries and recognizes Britain's position in Gibraltar; and (c) the Nationalist Army will compensate British ships that have been destroyed by Nationalist Army aircraft in ports controlled by the Spanish Republican government. In addition, Britain can provide short-term credit loans to Spain to purchase various raw materials, but most of the goods needed by Spain should be ordered from Britain. Also, credit loans will not be given to industries in Spain that employ German and Italian technical personnel. In short, the purpose of the above loan is to enable the Spanish Nationalist Army to repay its debts to Italy, so as to eliminate Italian influence and replace it with British influence. Once Sir Robert Hodgson returns to Burgos, he will explain to General Franco the need for the Nationalist Army government to maintain friendly relations with Britain and France, and will again urge the repatriation of Italian volunteers. However, the semi-official Italian newspaper *Il Popolo d'Italia* recently published an article stating that Italian volunteers can only be withdrawn after the Spanish Nationalist Army has achieved complete victory in both military and political aspects, which is quite worrying. The British government has ordered British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine to inquire about the views of the Italian government and to draw its attention to the obligations contained in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

San Sebastián, Spain - French moderate Senator Bérard arrived in Burgos this evening. After a short rest, he visited Spanish Academy Secretary Torres to discuss the issue of transporting valuable Spanish works of art into France for safe preservation. He is scheduled to return to Paris tomorrow morning to report to Foreign Minister Bonnet on his trip and talks with the Spanish Nationalist Army authorities. In addition, many members of the French Parliament arrived in Burgos and Barcelona today to conduct inspections. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### Internal Disagreement Among Various Western Communist Governments Regarding Peace or War

(Paris) This morning, various newspapers here confirmed that the Spanish Prime Minister Negrín had briefly visited French territory and has now returned to Spain. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 7th)

(Paris) Based on recent reports from various sources, the internal situation in Spain appears to be quite complex. The President of the Spanish Republic, Azaña, and Prime Minister Negrín hold differing views on the issue of peace or war. In other words, President Azaña advocates for reconciliation with the Nationalist forces, while Prime Minister Negrín insists on continuing the war, regardless of success or failure. President Azaña's flight to France was unanimously endorsed by his cabinet members. Prime Minister Negrín even escorted him to the French border before returning to the autonomous region of Catalonia to reorganize the army and continue the war. Currently, apart from the militia, very few of the national army soldiers have fled to France. President Azaña is now staying at the home of a relative in Longchamps, Voix province, and is expected to arrive here shortly. (Havas Telegraph, 7th)

Belbinan According to the Spanish News Agency, Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín visited northern Catalonia to inspect the Republican army lines along the Ter River. He expressed great satisfaction with the high morale of the Republican soldiers who are currently engaged in rear-guard actions. Military experts in Belbinan believe that the Nationalist forces are too far from their supply lines, resulting in logistical difficulties. The Republican army has thus obtained a welcome respite to rearrange its lines. It is widely believed that the Republican army may mount a final resistance in the Puigcerdà area. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)

(London) It is reported here that Spanish President Azaña has been secretly working towards peace for several months. He recently visited a village on the Swiss border to see his brother-in-law, the former Spanish Consul-General in Geneva, Rivas Cherif. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)

### Italian Troops Will Not Withdraw from Spain Until Political Victory Achieved, Paving the Way for Demands on France, The United States Worries About the Future of the European Situation

(Rome) Regarding the Spanish question, well-informed sources within the Fascist Party recently declared that even if the resistance of the Spanish government forces is completely broken, it is not certain that the Italian army units will remain stationed in Spanish territory. The reason is that after French Senator Bérard's activities in Burgos, Spain, General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, may be influenced by French power, which must be dealt with. In this way, the stationing of Italian troops in Spain has two advantages. Firstly, Italy's strategic and diplomatic position will be strengthened when it makes demands on France in the future. Secondly, the diplomatic orientation of the Spanish Nationalist government will be guaranteed; in other words, the Nationalist government will not establish friendly relations with France. Italy is aware that all this is inconsistent with the promises made by Prime Minister Mussolini to Prime Minister Chamberlain. The semi-official Italian newspaper, *Il Popolo d'Italia*, stated yesterday that after achieving military victory, the Spanish Nationalist forces must also achieve a complete political victory, implying that it intends to pave the way for Italian troops to remain stationed in Spain. (Havas Telegraph, 6th)

(New York) After the well-known Italian journalist Gayda published an article the day before yesterday, the United States felt uneasy. Gayda stated that Italian volunteers in Spain must wait until the Spanish Nationalist forces achieve political victory in addition to military victory before they can be withdrawn. This is a new explanation of Italy's attitude towards Spain. American newspapers are all asking what kind of impact the collapse of the Spanish Republican government will have. The *New York Times* reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, explaining the close relationship between Britain and France, indicating that the British government attaches great importance to Gayda's above-mentioned statement. The *New York Post* stated that the strength of the Spanish Republican government is dwindling, and its remaining forces on the northern Catalan front are being depleted on the roads leading to Perpignan in southern France. (Havas Telegraph, 7th)

### Spanish Rebel Army Advances Victoriously Along the Coast, Striving to Capture the Entire Region of Catalonia

Salamanca After the resistance of the Spanish government forces in Catalonia completely collapsed, General Franco is now engaged in encircling and suppressing the remaining government troops. The Nationalist forces on the coastal front in the Girona area have recently established positions on the left bank of the Tana River to control key points. Nationalist planes yesterday bombed Alicante and Cartagena, destroying one government cruiser and one destroyer each. Figueras also suffered considerable damage from multiple bombing raids. The Nationalist forces operating in the Puigcerdà area are advancing rapidly eastward along the Berga Highway, gradually approaching the French border. Despite the poor weather yesterday, the Nationalist forces continued to make progress, capturing many rugged mountainous areas. The Nationalist forces along the coast have already crossed Palamos and are advancing eastward towards Bisbal. This alone clearly demonstrates General Franco's strategy to capture the entire region of Catalonia. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 7th)

### Tens of Thousands of Refugees Cross the Border into France in Crowds, the Scene of Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young is Extremely Miserable, Soldiers are Disarmed and Sent to Detention Camps

(Paris) According to official statements, 40,000 Spanish refugees and soldiers have crossed the border into France in the past 24 hours. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)

Belbinan Nationalist forces have reached the outskirts of Andulas. It is estimated that 50,000 to 60,000 government troops are entering France every hour. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)

(Paris) According to an agreement negotiated between representatives of the French government and the Spanish government, the Spanish government militia began withdrawing into French territory from the village of Perthus this morning, in batches of 5,000. They were escorted into the country by French army gendarmes, disarmed, and then taken to concentration camps in Le Boulou and Arles-sur-Tech. The Spanish militiamen entering the country looked miserable as they were escorted by the French army, which saddened onlookers. The total strength of the Spanish forces on the French-Spanish border is approximately 110,000 to 120,000, of which 90,000 have retreated into French territory in Perthus, Cerbère, and Maureillas-las-Illas. The remaining 20,000 to 30,000 are still in the Spanish territories of Bellver and Ripoll, continuing to mount a final resistance. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 7th)

La Bourboule Long lines of Spanish refugees are crossing the border into France. Exhausted and hungry, they struggle to walk. The roadside trenches two miles outside the border are full of all kinds of military equipment, as Republican army deserters abandon machine guns, light machine guns, heavy pistols, and other firearms by the roadside and flee. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)

(Paris) According to official sources, no less than 130,000 Spanish women, children, and elderly have sought refuge in France in the past week. 110,000 of them have already been sent by the authorities to designated locations for accommodation. The government authorities expect that in the coming days, another 100,000 to 140,000 Spanish refugees and soldiers will continue to arrive in France. The total number of Spanish refugees in France will then increase sharply to 300,000. To accommodate these refugees, the authorities have established reception centers in various parts of the interior. Soldiers and able-bodied men among the refugees are sent to a large detention camp in Algiers, which can accommodate 100,000 people. So far, the Spanish refugees have been able to maintain discipline and no incidents have occurred. (Havas Telegraph, 6th)

### Opposition to President Roosevelt's Foreign Policy in Congress, the Momentum of the Opposition is Not Great

(Washington) The movement in Congress opposing President Roosevelt's aid to Britain and France to rearm has suffered a slight setback today. Although isolationist Republicans and conservative Democrats have tried their best to attack President Roosevelt, prominent Republicans are clearly unwilling to criticize the government's foreign policy. This is because the government's military preparedness plan and foreign policy have made a very good impression on the public, making it inconvenient to oppose them. The Senate has now adjourned and will resume debate on foreign policy issues on Thursday. (Associated Press Telegraph, 6th)

### Pittman Agrees to Stop Shipping Military Materials to Japan, Which Will Help Amend the Neutrality Act

(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said today that he fully agrees with the Secretary of State's recommendation that merchants voluntarily stop exporting aircraft. "Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, and I believe that we should not supply military materials to countries that violate treaties." Pittman's remarks are highly relevant to the current efforts in Congress to amend the Neutrality Act, and can at least provide a legal basis for President Roosevelt's tough actions against aggressor nations. At the same time, observers believe that even if the Neutrality Act is not amended, the voluntary cessation of arms exports by American merchants can also have a real effect. On the one hand, President Roosevelt's plan to help Britain and France rearm has kept the British arms industry busy, leaving no spare capacity to work for aggressor nations. Furthermore, the same voluntary cessation method can be applied to other arms industries besides aircraft. (Associated Press Telegraph, 6th)

### Italian Supreme Defense Council to Discuss Reorganizing Military and Economic Institutions, Appointed a Committee to Draft Wartime Organization Law

(Rome) The Supreme Defense Council will meet at 4 pm today to discuss the reorganization of national military and economic institutions. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 7th)

(Rome) The Italian government has appointed an advisory committee to discuss and draft a wartime organization law and a neutrality organization law. The committee held its first meeting yesterday, which was personally attended by Prime Minister Mussolini, who delivered a speech explaining the reasons for the Fascist government's drafting of the new wartime organization law. He stated that although Italy intends to take into account various international conventions related to the methods of using various armed forces, they have long been ignored in practice. Therefore, Italy should formulate a complete set of laws regarding war and neutrality within a short period of time, and its content will be more comprehensive than that of other countries. (Havas Telegraph, 8th)

### Dutch Foreign Minister Advocates Improving Relations with Germany

The Hague Foreign Minister Patijn recently submitted a summary to the Upper House, strongly arguing that the Netherlands needs to maintain good relations with Germany. If the major powers are not determined to maintain international order according to law, the Dutch foreign policy should not be based on the League of Nations. As for Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, in addition to containing various sanctions, it also stipulates that member states' troops should be provided with transit facilities if they resist aggressor nations in accordance with the Covenant. In the Netherlands, if a neighboring country becomes an aggressor nation, it must refuse foreign troops to pass through its territory to assist the invaded country, because the passage of foreign troops is very likely to cause war and cause the Netherlands to become a battlefield. Regarding the relationship between the Netherlands and Germany, German leader Hitler stated in a speech on January 30th that Germany is willing to maintain good relations with the Netherlands. The Dutch government should also avoid any actions that may hinder this good relationship. When the Dutch people criticize the international situation, they must do so with a moderate attitude, otherwise, the harm it causes may be beyond their imagination. "At this time, ideological tendencies and political tendencies are intertwined and mutually agitated. If we want to restore normal relations between nations, we must be moderate." The Dutch nation greatly admires Germany's efforts to improve itself and its national strength since the European War. As for the Dutch Jews residing in Germany, the government cares about these Jews just as it cares about other overseas Chinese. So far, it is fortunate that no Dutch Jews have had their property confiscated or been deported by the German government. (Havas Telegraph, 6th)

### Opening of the Palestine Conference at St. James's Palace, British Prime Minister Chamberlain Delivers a Welcome Speech, Hoping for Understanding Between Arab and Jewish Nations to Lay the Foundation for Peace

(London) The Palestine conference opened at 10:30 this morning at St. James's Palace. According to the scheduled procedure, British representatives first spoke with Arab representatives and then with Jewish representatives. In addition to Prime Minister Chamberlain, the chairman of the conference, British attendees today included Foreign Secretary Halifax, Under-Secretary Butler, and Colonial Secretary MacDonald. On the Arab side, in addition to the absence of "moderate" representatives, the attendees included representatives from Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Transjordan, and local Palestinian Arab representatives. Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech, saying that he welcomed the political leaders of the Arab people of Palestine and the representatives of neighboring countries. "It is even more gratifying that these countries are willing to cooperate with us to seek a wise solution to the current difficulties to protect the rights and status of the Arab people of Palestine. This discussion should be thorough, frank, and free, in order to achieve the most satisfactory result. In order to conform to this principle, the British representatives do not want to be the first to propose any scope of discussion, nor do they offer their own opinions, so that the Arab and Jewish nations can have a full opportunity to explain their wishes." In short, what Britain seeks is to maintain peace and hopes that a permanent foundation of peace can be laid in Palestine as soon as possible. "Gathering together today is the first major step in establishing a relationship of understanding. It is important to know that although our current responsibilities are difficult, if we can work together harmoniously, everything will be solved easily. It is hoped that those who are present today will concentrate their energy and spirit, conduct a precise and accurate review of the actual problems of the current situation and the main circumstances of various facts, and respect and understand each other's situations and views. Eventually, they will understand and complement each other," he said. Prince Muhammad Abdu Munam, the chief representative of Egypt, immediately gave a reply, saying that he hopes that security can be restored in Palestine and that various current issues can be resolved in a friendly manner. (Havas Telegraph, 7th)

(London) The Arab delegation, composed of representatives of the Grand Mufti and representatives of various countries around Palestine, was previously received by Chamberlain in the Queen Anne drawing-room, the famous one leading to the venue. The British side tried its best to separate the representatives of both sides attending the meeting to avoid conflict, because the Arabs refused to sit in the same place as the Jews. Therefore, the British Prime Minister met the Jewish delegation alone in the banquet hall on the other side of the venue. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)

### Representatives of the Arab Higher Committee Drafted a Proposal Containing Four Demands, The Two Arab Delegations Show No Possibility of Approaching Each Other

(London) Representatives of the Arab Higher Committee are now engaged in final preparations to formulate demands to be submitted to the Palestine Conference opening here tomorrow. In short, their demands are the following: (1) Recognition of Palestine's complete independence; (2) Replacement of the mandate system with a treaty; (3) Abolition of the Balfour Declaration; (4) Immediate cessation of Jewish immigration. The representatives have received many telegrams from groups in Egypt and Palestine, especially emphasizing the following two points: (1) Self-Defense Party representatives can only speak for their own party; (2) The Higher Committee is the only group representing Palestine. Therefore, the telegrams have made the Grand Mufti Party's attitude towards the Self-Defense Party even tougher, and the possibility of the two Arab delegations approaching each other seems hopeless at present. At the same time, the Indian Muslim League has telegraphed its London representative to provide assistance to the Arab demands and issued a statement of sympathy and support for Palestine's independence demands. A copy of the statement has been submitted to the Secretary of State for India, who promised to convey the contents of the statement to the government. Nashashibi, the chief representative of the Arab Self-Defense Party, recently told a Reuters interviewer that he should feel that the British government is indeed genuinely intending to establish peace in Palestine. The Self-Defense Party delegation is willing to accept any proposal that can promote Palestine's independence. The party represents at least 75% of Palestine's important interests and represents more than 50% of the people. Regardless of the outcome, the Self-Defense Party delegation will pretend to be a country and do what it should do, without involving personal ambitions. The Self-Defense Party will fully cooperate with the government in order to obtain a solution. According to news last night, the Jewish permanent negotiation delegation includes Weizmann, Brodetsky, Grian, Hertock, and Goldman, and other representatives will assist from time to time. (Reuters, 7th)

### Arabs Declare a Three-Day Strike, Crowding the Grand Mufti

Jerusalem Well-informed observers view the three-day strike announced yesterday in Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine as a very cunning movement to crowd the Grand Mufti. The purpose is self-evident, which is to oppose the delegation of the Arab Self-Defense Party led by Nashashibi to London. The organizers of the strike did not show their hand until the delegation departed for London, so that Nashashibi's accomplices were still unable to defend themselves due to fear of resistance. This movement also shows the British government that the Arab people are united and willing to be behind the Grand Mufti. The English accountant of the Palestine Railway Haifa Station, Mr. Yang, was shot and slightly injured yesterday. Not long after, a Jewish bus was ambushed, killing one person and injuring five others. In addition, a loan car near Lydda derailed. Because of this, the military commander has banned Arab trade exports and imports in Jaffa until the section of track is repaired. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)

### Burma Will Have a New National Flag

(London) Burma will soon have its own national flag, and in accordance with the status allowed by the British government after separating from India in 1937, it will become an autonomous unit of the British Empire. The Burmese national flag has a blue background, with the British national flag in the upper left corner and a peacock in the right half, drawn in gold. The peacock pattern is taken from the silver coins cast and issued during the reign of King Mindon in 1852. Since 1852, the peacock has implicitly become the national emblem of Burma.

### Uprising of the Puppet Army in Xuzhou

(Huaiyin) The Japanese army in Xuzhou attacked east in three routes, all forcing their way to the west bank of the Jun River. After Xu Miaokun led more than a thousand troops to revolt, the puppet troops of Li Guanying on the northern route disintegrated. The troops of Liu Fulong in Nanjing also began to brew an uprising and are now showing signs of collapse. Only the Japanese army on the central route still intends to attack east alone to cover the Longhai Railway, but they have been blocked head-on by the Chinese army. The bandits and puppet troops were supplied by the Japanese army with a large number of bullets, clothing, cash, and military maps. Li and Liu, the rebels, were unable to support their troops because Wang and others in their troops fled to Tianjin with the money. The Japanese army suffered a huge deception and does not trust the puppet organizations. Xu Yankun has now led his troops to Huaiyin to report on the events, and the authorities have given him a special reward. (Telegraph, 7th)

### From Chongqing to Chengdu: The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is Under Construction, Neijiang Produces Extremely Abundant Sugar

Chengdu Correspondence, Xikang is located in the western frontier and possesses wealth surpassing the southwest. The central government, in an effort to develop it, specifically established the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee in Kangding in the 24th year of the Republic [1935]. Three years later, preparations were completed, and the newly appointed members of the Xikang Provincial Committee gathered in Kangding. On New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], the provincial government establishment ceremony was held. After the fall of the capital, the reporter rushed to the war zone, traversing six provinces for nearly a year. After the abandonment of Wuhan, I escaped to Chongqing. Now that the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun, the development of the southwest cannot be delayed. Xikang is a virgin land in the southwest, and before its development, it is urgently necessary for Chinese people to go and investigate in order to understand it. Therefore, I decided to go to the province to carry out investigation work, and incidentally inspect the Sichuan border, and make the findings public to the people of the country, so that it can serve as a means of production. On the morning of December 26th, the reporter took a long-distance bus from the Sichuan Highway Bureau from Chongqing, and set off west along the Chengdu-Chongqing highway. The situation seen along the way is recorded as follows.

Departing from Chongqing In recent months, the Sichuan Highway Bureau has seen an increasing number of passengers traveling west by bus. In order to maintain order, it has specifically stipulated that passengers must pre-register and pre-purchase tickets, and board the bus in order. The reporter purchased a ticket and waited for as long as twelve days before finally boarding the bus on the morning of the 26th. There were more than twenty passengers, sitting in rows of five according to their assigned seats, and the seats were small and crowded. At eight o'clock, the bus departed from the Chongqing station. At that time, the cold wind was sharp, and the cloudy sky was misty. The entire city of Chongqing was shrouded in thin clouds and thick fog. Due to the continuous rainy days, the road was muddy. The bus sped along the road, splashing cement everywhere. In the suburbs, green trees and bamboo leaned against the villages and hills. Along the way, diligent and simple villagers carried goods to the market in an endless stream. When the bus arrived at Xiaolongkan Station, soldiers came forward to check the passenger manifest. Further ahead, the road gradually entered mountainous terrain. The highway was built along the mountainside, and the bus sped around the mountains. Sometimes it spiraled upwards, sometimes it meandered downwards. Sometimes traveling on the ridge, sometimes driving at the foot of the mountain. Rice paddies and villages were all within sight. It is said that this section of the mountain road was built by German engineers in those years. The project was arduous and took a long time to complete. After passing Qingmuguan, the highway gradually became flat. Many workers were seen doing earthwork and crushing stones on the roadbed of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The bus passed through Bishan County and then arrived at Laifengyi Station. The driver and passengers got off the bus and had lunch in a small restaurant. After the meal, the bus continued to move forward. After passing Yongchuan, a female passenger got off the bus. When arriving at Anfu Town, it was heard from the station staff that Japanese planes attacked Sichuan and bombed Hechuan County. When the bus passed through the territory of Longchang County, male and female elementary school students stopped the bus on the highway to solicit donations for national salvation. At about 3 p.m., the bus arrived at Beimu Town and transferred to a ferry to cross the river. In the heart of the river, there were iron bridge piers built by the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Bureau, totaling five spans. The bridge deck materials have been transported, and the bridge will be erected next year. At about 4 p.m., the bus arrived at Neijiang County, and the passengers got off the bus. Stayed there that night.

A Glimpse of Neijiang Neijiang is a relatively prosperous county in southern Sichuan. Although the urban area is not large, the roads are clean and tidy, and the city buildings are prosperous. Commerce surpasses neighboring counties. The reporter and two middle school students from Chengdu, who were colleagues, stayed at the Wansheng Hotel on Jiaotong East Road. After washing up, I went out to the main street for a tour. I saw electric lights shining brightly and pedestrians bustling about. The most lively place in the county is Zhongshan Road. There are bookstores selling new culture medical books and sound movie theaters. There are several banks and all kinds of other shops. Tea houses are especially numerous. The reporter then went to the county government to visit County Chief Luo Rongli. Luo was out on business, and Secretary Yao Songshou received him. When asked about the local situation, he said that the total population of Neijiang County is about 500,000, and the urban area accounts for one-tenth. There are a total of more than 400 elementary schools. The county seat has a junior high school. The main product is sugarcane. Due to the widespread planting, the production of rice is relatively small, and it is not enough to meet the demand for food. It all depends on the supply from other counties. Because the county produces a large amount of sugarcane, the output of sugar is also large. However, the cracking method is still the old method. It seems that new methods should be used to improve it in order to seek large-scale production and sales. There are five banks here: China, Juxingcheng, Chuan Salt, Chongqing, and Chuan Kang. In addition, there is the Neijiang Local Court located in the county government. The national salvation organization has a mobilization committee, and the people's anti-war emotions are strong. Then returned to the residence to sleep. The next morning (December 27) at 7:30, take a bus to Chengdu.

Arriving in Chengdu It is well known that Sichuan Province has layers of mountains and dangerous roads. However, the Chengdu-Chongqing line only has undulating hills and uneven mounds, not like the high mountains and large mountains of eastern Sichuan, which are continuous and towering. Therefore, most of the Chengdu-Chongqing highway is flat and easy to travel. After the bus departed from Neijiang, it turned northwest and drove forward. There are many sugar canes in the fields on both sides of the road, and farmers are harvesting. There are piles of sugarcane leaves exposed on the road, ready for use as fuel for livestock. Further west, the roadbed is uneven. Because the slope goes up and down, the bus travels sometimes slowly and sometimes quickly. In addition to the patches of sugarcane in the fields, there are wheat and broad beans, peas, radishes and other crops. Entering the territory of Zizhong County, there are more and more sugar canes. At about 10 o'clock, the bus arrived at Qiuxi River, where it had lunch. After the meal, continued to move forward. Arrived at Linjiang Temple in Ziyang for a rest and to repair the machinery. At 2 p.m., the bus arrived at Luohai Township in Jianyang County. The bus engine suddenly broke down, and the passengers all got off the bus. The workers repaired it for about an hour before continuing to drive. After the bus passed Chadianzi, it gradually entered the mountains. The highway winds and the bus moves forward in twists and turns, sometimes along the mountainside, sometimes around the mountains. It turns and turns, and finally reaches the top of the mountain. Looking down from the window, the abyss is deep and secluded, which is frightening. At that time, the evening smoke rises everywhere, and the twilight is vast. The bus passed Longquanyi, and the night had already begun. Looking at the lights of Chengdu in the distance, I knew that arrival was imminent. At 5:40, the bus arrived at the East Outer Station and stopped. The two-day journey came to an end. The reporter plans to rest in Chengdu for a few days and then go to Kangding.

### Guangdong Military Commanders Hold Guerrilla Warfare Meeting

Shantou Correspondence, Zhang Fakui, commander of the Fourth War Zone, completed his inspection of the northeastern Jiangxi war zone. On the 25th, he held a conference of commanding officers in charge of guerrilla warfare throughout the province in Wengyuan to discuss the names, organization, funding, and weapons of the guerrilla forces in various regions. Yu Hanmou, Li Hanhun, Cai Tingkai, and the central government's special envoys Chen Cheng, Luo Zhuoying, Wu Qiwai, etc., all sent representatives to participate, or personally attended to provide guidance. The guerrilla commanders of various regions who had previously gone to Shantou to go to Wengyuan included Ye Ting, Deng Yanhua, Zhang Wodong, Liu Zhilu, and Weng Zhaoyuan. Those who set out from various places included Li Fulin, Wu Guanqi, Zhang Huichang, Li Wuzi, Feng Zhuoxun, Zhang Junsong, Tan Qixiu, Hu Wencan, Ma Yi, etc., totaling more than 100 people, all leaders of the armed forces of the Guangdong people. It is reported that after the abolition of the Guangdong Provincial Self-Defense Team Command Committee, the command committees of various districts and counties were dissolved and renamed guerrilla command headquarters. The county government also set up command posts. Each county pre-selected several mountainous areas as guerrilla bases, and all the local team armed forces were reorganized into guerrilla forces, with uniform organization and supplies. The purpose is to cooperate with the regular army in combat. After this Wengyuan conference, the armed forces of the people of Guangdong are expected to be fundamentally renewed, and close ties will be established between the military and political grassroots.

### Japanese Warships Bomb, Imperial Airways Mail Plane Encounters Danger, Captain Returns to Hong Kong, Truth Revealed

Hong Kong Correspondence, A few months ago, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane "Guilin" flew from Hong Kong to Hankou and was tragically attacked by Japanese planes over Zhongshan County at the mouth of the Pearl River, resulting in the destruction of the plane and the loss of life, creating an unprecedented tragedy. The pain is still in our minds. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army, which recently invaded southern China, fired on the Imperial Airways plane "Gielandia" flying from Hong Kong. Fortunately, no tragedy occurred. It was found that the Imperial Airways plane "Gielandia" was attacked by Japanese artillery on the morning of the 27th of last month, over the sea of Wanshan Islands. Afterwards, because the Hong Kong authorities kept the matter secret, no one knew the details. Yesterday (2nd) afternoon, Wilson, the captain of the "Gielandia" plane who had encountered danger at that time, returned to Hong Kong in another plane, the "Danae". The detailed process was finally made public. It is reported that at 7 a.m. on the 21st of last month, the Imperial Airways Hong Kong-Manila mail plane "Gielandia", piloted by Captain Wilson, took off from Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon. When the plane flew to the sky over Wanshan Islands, about 250 miles from Hong Kong, Wilson looked down from the plane and saw two fishing boats burning on the sea. The flames spread everywhere, and the fierce flames soared into the sky. They burned and drifted, and the situation was extremely tragic. A Japanese warship was slowly advancing behind the fishing boats, seemingly still monitoring the burning. Wilson thought that this kind of incident was commonplace in the South China Sea, so he did not pay attention to it. Unexpectedly, the plane advanced only a few miles. In the south of Wanshan Islands, another Japanese transport ship was discovered. Wilson was staring down, when suddenly a ball of smoke and fire came out from the side of the ship. It was then that he knew that the ship had fired at the plane. Without changing his expression, he slightly moved the plane upwards, raising it from a height of one thousand feet to fifteen hundred feet. However, the Japanese warship continued to fire. The first shell passed over the top of the plane and fell into the sea. The second and third shells followed. Fortunately, none of them hit. As for the fourth shell, its range was just the height of the plane, and it exploded with a bang. Fortunately, the distance from the fuselage was relatively far, and it was not damaged. At that point, Wilson fully accelerated and flew forward quickly. After escaping the danger, he immediately sent a telegram to inform the "Danae", which had taken off half an hour later than the "Gielandia", instructing it to quickly change its course and never pass through Wanshan Islands again. After receiving the telegram, the "Danae" immediately bypassed Wanshan Islands 40 miles south to avoid being attacked again. After this incident occurred, the Hong Kong authorities did not make any public statements, so it is not known whether a protest has been lodged with the Japanese. However, it is heard that Imperial Airways may temporarily change its route in the future to avoid incidents.

### The Jiangsu Construction Department Plans to Set Up a Shipping Management Office and Formulate Organizational Rules

Huaiyin Correspondence, The Jiangsu Construction Department has learned that after various shipping companies in the province have obtained routes from the department, they operate freely. The departure times are often not connected, which is inconvenient for merchants and travelers. The transportation of passengers and goods has never been regulated, and supply and demand are difficult to balance. It is urgent to reorganize it in order to provide relief and meet practical needs. It has specially prepared the draft of the organizational regulations and budget for the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Shipping Management Office, which has been submitted to the provincial government meeting for amendment and approval. Director Xu of the department has also been appointed as the director of the office. The Huaiyin Hebei Bank of Communications warehouse has been selected as the office address, and it will be formally established soon. It is learned that the organization of the office is divided into three sections: general affairs, transportation, and inspection, to carry out the affairs. Temporary offices have been set up in Hexing Town in Shanghai and Taixian County. Additional offices will be set up in other places as necessary.

### Japanese Warships Bomb Dinghai, Several Shops are Destroyed, "Li Bao" Wheel is Searched En Route

Ningbo Special Dispatch, Three warships of the Japanese Fourth Fleet arrived at the waters of Datoutou in Dinghai on the morning of the 5th, one after another. They lowered a small motorboat to chase sailing boats and shot at them with rifles. The army and police on the shore immediately retaliated with machine guns. The motorboat scurried back to the ship. The Japanese warships then bombarded the shore with fierce artillery fire, totaling more than ten rounds, and then stopped. At 9 p.m., they fired more than 20 rounds again without being retaliated against. At about 8 a.m. on the morning of the 6th, they fired two shots at the shore. The Tongshoutai Sauce Garden, Yangchun Restaurant, and Dongyue Temple in front of Datoutou were destroyed by artillery fire. It is not known whether there were any casualties among the people. The Portuguese merchant ship "Li Bao" set sail to Ningbo at 6 a.m. on the 6th. It was obstructed by Japanese warships, and was released only after a motorboat was sent to board the ship for inspection.

### The Yellow River Breach is Temporarily Difficult to Block, Dredge the Subei Waterway to the Sea

The Central Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Start Work First, The First Phase of the Project Requires 400,000 Yuan

Taixian Special Dispatch, Since the breach of the Yellow River in Yu, flowing down to the south, the Lixia River area, such as Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, Jiangyan, Taixian, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an and other counties, have all suffered greatly. The gentry and officials of the above-mentioned counties, because it is winter, and the accumulated water in the lower reaches has not yet receded. If no measures are taken to cut off the source of the Yellow River and dredge the waterway east of the Fan Gong Dike into the sea, then when the peach flood arrives, the entire northern Jiangsu will inevitably be submerged by half. They jointly telegraphed the National Government and relevant ministries and councils. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has repeatedly appealed. The Jiangsu Provincial Government also knows that if the upstream flow is not cut off and the river into the sea is not dredged, the catastrophe in northern Jiangsu will be unavoidable. It has repeatedly reported the situation to the central government and requested that measures be taken to block the breaches at the Zhaokou in Zhongmou, Henan and the Huayuankou in Zheng County to cut off the source. On one hand, it organized the Lixia River Waterway Dredging Project Commission in Dongtai, and appointed Han Guojun as the chairman. It also convened the first standing committee meeting in Dongtai to discuss the dredging project plan.

The Construction Procedure is Divided into Three Phases

The construction procedures have also been agreed upon. It has been found that there are five major ports east of the Fan Dike. In recent years, the Chuan Dong Port, also known as the Xingchuan Port, has been opened, totaling six ports. The Suyang River has the most unobstructed drainage, followed by the Xinyang Port and the Doulong Port. The Wangjia Port, the Zhu Port, and the Chuan Dong Port are the next. All six ports are currently flowing water. It is difficult to cut off the dam and make large diversions. The only way is to dredge the tributaries in order to discharge more cubic meters of water, which can reduce the flood by one cubic meter. As for the construction procedures, they are divided into three phases, depending on the amount of funds available, in order of priority. The first phase is the most urgent. The Eight Hundred Wen Yin River and its upstream second Maoyou River flow out of Wangjia Port. The fourth Maoyou River flows out of Shiwan Port, so it is to divert the water from Doulong Port and return it to the sea in different ways. Doulong is located in the middle of the five major ports, and the main stream, which receives many tributaries on the left, is mostly curved, making it difficult to collect. It is advisable to seek to reduce its flow or cut off its bends to make it faster and straighter. In addition, the Xichao River diverts the water from the Wuyou Chuan Chang River and merges with the Sheyang River estuary to return to the sea. Chuan Chang is the key to the waterway to the sea, and it is advisable to open more routes to prevent it from being blocked. This is the first phase of the work that must be done. The other two phases of work are detailed in the plan. The total cost of the project is estimated to be over one million yuan, and the first phase also requires more than 400,000 yuan. In terms of its effectiveness, if the Yellow River does not come and the post dam is blocked, the accumulated water in the lower reaches can gradually be reduced, and the people's fields can be dried up, so as not to miss the spring plowing.

The Central Government Allocates Funds to Subsidize Dredging

The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the two breaches of the Yellow River at Huayuankou and Zhaokou have already been ordered by the Central Government to be closed due to special circumstances. In the future, the main flow of the Yellow River will change its course from here, seizing the Huai and entering Jiangsu. The section of the Huai River downstream into the sea has collapsed a lot, and the quicksand has also silted up the riverbed. The Yellow River swirls and wraps around the Lixia River area, failing to flow smoothly into the sea, resulting in floods in Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an, and Yangzhou counties, and causing serious disasters. Chairman Han believes that since the root cause cannot be cured, the symptoms must be treated first. He prepares to dredge the Lixia River waterway into the sea. The Provincial Government previously telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, requesting a subsidy of 100,000 yuan for the project to start work. Yesterday, the Minister Weng Wenhao telegram (23rd) was received, stating that the case of blocking the breach of the Yellow River was previously submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan for discussion and a public resolution, and that the provincial government should also discuss the case together. It was resolved that the waterway dredging project should be investigated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a subsidy should be given at its discretion. Because the dredging project is of vital importance, and according to the previous order, the subsidy of 100,000 yuan should be allocated to assist. In addition to responding, a telegram will be sent requesting that someone be sent with the seal to the Ministry to discuss the receipt.

Wu Zhihui and Others Telegraphed Their Opinions

Wu Zhihui, Chen Guofu, Niu Yongjian, etc. telegraphed Chairman Han, and also told Han Zhilao, saying that the Yellow River blockage project may be difficult to realize, and it is planned to ask the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee to handle it again. However, this year's Yellow River flood may converge in northern Jiangsu, and it is hoped that the dredging project to the sea will be rushed to avoid the permanent sinking disaster in Huai'an and Yangzhou counties. It is also said that Shen Baixian is now preparing to propose a northern Jiangsu water control plan, and will request that it be adopted. Yu Jingtang, a member of the Central Executive Committee and former director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, once sent a telegram to Han Zhilao, which read, "I have received all the telegrams. I have discussed the matter of water discharge with Guofu, Chuqiang, and Yushou. We all feel that it is difficult to achieve success in treating the root cause due to environmental conditions for a while. We are discussing other methods and will jointly respond in a telegram within days. Recently, I have repeatedly consulted with Junti Baixian. We all believe that the current northern Jiangsu flood should be quickly blocked and the two new dams should be sealed to cut off the flow. Build three river grass dams and open the Changzhuang active dam to force the flow into the sea. Dredge the blocked parts of the lower river leading to the sea to facilitate drainage. However, increasing the size of the port leading to the sea is a huge project with little effect. For the sake of next year's major flood, it seems more feasible and urgent to strengthen the western embankment of the Grand Canal from Baoying to Shaobo, so as to increase the storage of floodwater in Hongze Lake. The Hongze Lake embankment itself, in addition to adding stone work, does not need to be strengthened for the time being. This is Junti Baixian's opinion, and I am sending it to you in advance for reference."

### Yixing Under the Rule of the National Army: Improving Governance and Enhancing Self-Defense (Continued)

Abolishing Unfair Taxes and Stabilizing Finance: Education and Judiciary Have Returned to the Old Norms

Sorting out public funds and public assets: The public funds and assets of the local area after the war were chaotic, either embezzled by unscrupulous individuals for personal gain, or misappropriated by local authorities. A method of sorting them out has been drafted and distributed to various districts for active rectification. In the future, the Finance Committee will be responsible for handling it.  Balancing prices: All kinds of essential goods are strictly prohibited from being inflated in price, reducing the burden on the military and civilians, and eliminating the phenomenon of hoarding for profit. At the same time, except for the consumption goods of cigarettes, which are subject to a small inspection fee in accordance with provincial orders, all other taxes on various essential goods are exempted. Stabilizing finance: War zones are full of traitors, deliberately spreading rumors in an attempt to undermine China's legal tender policy. This has been thoroughly destroyed, enhancing the credibility of legal tender.  Prohibiting the sale of Japanese goods: Certain parties are transporting large quantities of Japanese goods to the interior, carrying out economic aggression. Merchants are now strictly prohibited from selling them, and business registration is being conducted for control purposes. If found, they will be severely punished.  Sorting out land tax registers: The land tax registers of the entire county have been assigned to specialists for sorting and moving to safe locations to ensure the property rights of the people.  Abolishing unfair levies and miscellaneous taxes: The county has repeatedly experienced turmoil, and there is a lack of local leadership, leading to a loss of system and chaotic social order. Local ruffians and informal guerrilla units have taken the opportunity to set up checkpoints and levy taxes, making life difficult for the people. Since County Magistrate Shao took office, all of these have been abolished to relieve the people's suffering.

People's Self-Defense

(C) Self-Defense:  Organizing Standing Teams: In the past, the county government's direct armed force was the special task force of the People's Self-Defense Force. Now, in accordance with provincial orders, it has been reorganized into a standing squadron. Three squadrons have been established, and the fourth squadron is being expanded. Discipline is clearly defined, and it has gained the trust of the people.  Organizing National Self-Defense Corps: The entire county is organized into eight district brigades, and each district brigade is divided into eight teams: (1) Work Team, (2) Iron Shoulder Team, (3) Relief Team, (4) Intelligence Team, (5) Disciplinary Team, (6) Messenger Team, (7) Propaganda Team, (8) Demolition Team. Each township mobilizes more than 300 people on a regular basis.  Conducting Firearm Registration: The purpose of firearm registration is to count and protect the people's armed forces, allocate ammunition, and defend the homeland. The public is enthusiastically registering.  Recruiting Soldiers: This time, the county government was ordered to recruit soldiers, and it has been transferred as scheduled. It is rare for Yixing people to go out as soldiers, but this time, young men throughout the county have enthusiastically enlisted.  Destroying Highways: All highways within the county have been completely destroyed. Young men enthusiastically participated in the work. During the most tense period, more than 10,000 young men were mobilized at the same time.  Establishing Sentry Communication Network and Receiving Stations: Sentries are densely deployed in important towns within the county, and receiving stations are set up to facilitate the transmission of information. A total of 88 stations of all levels, including general and branch stations, and 7 receiving stations have been set up throughout the county. As for communication matters with other counties, a communication network has been organized. There are close ties with Jiangyin, Wuxi, Wujin, Aoyang, Gaochun, and Jintan counties.  Constructing Defensive Works: Following the orders of the garrison commander, the people were mobilized to construct various strong defensive works.  Efforts to Eliminate Traitors: The leading traitors, Zhou Shichang, Luo Zhiying, Li Ya'er, Xiang Penggui, Li Songbai, Hong Lao Hong, etc., have all been successively captured by the county government and sentenced to capital punishment, greatly pleasing the people. The self-defense forces in various districts and the standing squadrons do not distinguish between day and night, assisting the garrison in defense, and launching guerrilla attacks at any time, repeatedly making contributions. (D) Education: Yixing's education was originally developed, but unfortunately, after two invasions by the Japanese army, all construction within the territory was destroyed, and education was also greatly impacted. Now, after active rectification, it is gradually returning to the old norm. Currently, there are: One secondary school with four branches, totaling eight grades; Seventeen complete elementary schools with thirty-six grades; One hundred and seventy-nine primary schools with two hundred and fifty-five grades. (E) Judiciary: In order to protect human rights and maintain judicial dignity, the establishment of a Judicial Section was approved by the Provincial Government and the Supreme Court, effective from November 21, 27th year. Judicial police officers have been appointed separately, and various judicial papers have been printed in accordance with regulations. Civil and criminal lawsuits are handled in accordance with the proper procedures, which is no different from before the war. In addition, the county government also publishes the Yixing Daily to promote the significance of resistance against Japan, in order to achieve the task of spiritual mobilization. (The End)

### Bandit Suppression Period in Linhai

Linhai Correspondence: The people of this county are strong and brave, and there have always been many bandit troubles. During this extraordinary period, the banditry is especially rampant. Since County Magistrate Cao took office, he has personally gone down to the villages for inspections. He has drafted a plan for bandit suppression and carried out zonal extermination. In recent days, thanks to the effective command of the bandit suppression officers in various districts and the valiant efforts of the soldiers, the number of bandits killed and captured and the refugees rescued is countless. However, the original plan was to suppress bandits for one month, from January 16th to February 15th. In order to completely eradicate them, County Magistrate Cao has reportedly requested an extension of two months to ensure complete eradication.

### Customs Revenue of Shanghai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Jiaodong: 150 Million Intercepted; Unauthorized Reduction of Tax Rates Benefits Japan; Funds for Customs-Secured Debt are Unfunded

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, North China and Shanghai, unfortunately, have successively fallen into war zones.

### Japan Illegally Inspects and Detains Foreign Vessels; Various Consulates Have Protested

Japanese Navy Claims Inspections are Appropriate; Prevent Chinese Vessels from Hanging Foreign Flags for Protection

New Voice News Agency reports: Foreign vessels sailing along China's coast and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are frequently subjected to illegal inspections and detentions by Japanese warships, causing significant losses to foreign vessels. The consuls of the countries to which the detained foreign vessels belong have protested to the Japanese authorities. However, according to the response from the Japanese naval authorities, regarding the issue of inspecting vessels flying the flags of third countries, such inspections are not an unusual or serious matter. It does not seem excessive for the Japanese side to inspect vessels flying foreign flags. They firmly believe that after the war, all Chinese merchant vessels are using foreign flags for protection. For example, the Ada, a vessel flying the Hungarian flag that was recently detained by the Japanese navy in Xiamen, is worthy of research as to whether it belongs to Hungary.

The Continental Daily reports:

The Hungarian wooden merchant vessel Ada, weighing 137 tons, was still detained by the Japanese navy at a certain pier in Xiamen Port last night (6th). According to a Japanese navy spokesman last night, the Ada vessel is staying there pending the completion of a thorough investigation of the procedures of its owner. According to inquiries from shipping circles in this port:

The captain of the Ada vessel is Norwegian, Steen, and there are 30 to 40 Chinese crew members. The vessel's agency in this port replied to inquiries yesterday afternoon, denying that the vessel was carrying passengers and expressly stating that it only had a special permit to transport goods. The vessel was originally named Tongli (transliteration) and was built in Wenzhou in 1935. On October 27th of last year, it was purchased by a Hungarian named Komor. After installing a motor, it was managed by the

new owner.

The reporter asked the spokesman: If the Ada vessel changed ownership on this day and is operated by people from a third country, does it comply with the Japanese navy's regulations? The spokesman replied that the Japanese navy will decide its attitude towards this incident based on the authenticity of the change of ownership and other factors. It has been rumored that Chinese-owned sailboats and other vessels are flying the flags of third countries, so the Japanese navy reserves the right to investigate the

identity of these vessels.

If it is determined that the owner is completely foreign, it will be released immediately. The spokesman replied again that the Japanese authorities have not yet demanded compensation for time and other losses for detaining any foreign vessels and investigating their owners. The current detention of the Ada and other vessels has no special meaning and does not indicate a "change of policy," but is merely a "fixed policy" consistently clarified in the declaration issued by the Japanese navy to Chinese vessels a few months ago.

### New Commander of British Troops in Shanghai

Reuters, London, 7th: The War Office has announced that it has appointed Colonel Simmons, currently stationed in Palestine, as the commander of the British troops in Shanghai, effective June 5th.

### Second Batch of US Relief Wheat to Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Quantity Larger, Approximately 3,000 Tons

A large batch of US relief wheat for China, previously 2,600 tons, was transported to Shanghai. According to shipping industry news, its second batch of relief wheat has also been shipped from the United States to Shanghai on a Wei Li Han Company cargo ship. The quantity is larger than the last time, approximately 3,000 tons, and will arrive in Shanghai within a few days.

### Complex Issues Require Time to Resolve; Hongkou Still Difficult to Open

Rumors of the Opening of Broadway Road; Investigation Proves it is Untrue

Negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side on the issue of opening Hongkou have lasted for more than a year without results. Yesterday, rumors suddenly spread that the area around East Broadway Road in Hongkou will be officially opened during the Lunar New Year, allowing residents to freely move in and reside there, etc. After reporters inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Council, they learned that this rumor is not true. The official opening of Hongkou is, in fact, still premature. Although the negotiations between the two sides are still progressing smoothly, there is no actual decision. The Shanghai Municipal Council believes that this matter is complex and there are many difficulties, and it will take time to resolve it.

### Japanese Come to Shanghai to Seek a Living, Holding High Hopes

Few Find Employment; Residents' Association Responds

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports: According to Japanese sources, Japanese people who came to Shanghai from Japan with only travel expenses to seek employment are now finding it difficult to fulfill their wishes. Only about three-tenths of them are employed. When their travel funds run out, these job seekers have no choice but to apply to the employment agency of the Japanese Residents' Association. Therefore, the department has been unusually busy recently. According to figures released by the department, 296 men and 68 women applied to the department in December last year. Only 102 men and 8 women were employed. In January, there were 228 men and 44 women, and only 85 men and 18 women were employed. Among the various occupations handled by the department, drivers, interpreters, shop assistants, secretaries, nurses, telephone operators, and cooks are the most numerous.

### Redemption of Unified Class A Public Bonds; Lottery Drawing the Day After Tomorrow; Payment of Principal and Interest of the Revival Bond at the End of the Month

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Requesting Permission for Raw Lacquer to be Transported to Shanghai

Shanghai Commerce is Concentrated in the Concessions; Raw Lacquer is Not an Item that Benefits Japan

After the customs of Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces were ordered to prohibit the transport of tung oil, timber, cotton, raw lacquer, etc., to Shanghai, the chambers of commerce and industry associations in various places cabled requesting a lifting of the ban. The raw lacquer and other industries in Shanghai previously sent personnel to the interior to purchase native goods and transport them to Shanghai. Recently, due to the customs' prohibition order, they could not be released. Now, the Raw Lacquer Industry Association has specially reported to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that Shanghai commerce is concentrated in the concession areas. Since the withdrawal of the National Army to the west, the commercial activities in Nanshi and Zhabei that could be relocated have been moved to the safety zones of the two concessions. Raw lacquer is necessary for the coating of residents' daily utensils and is not an item that benefits Japan. Therefore, it has cabled the Ministry of Economic Affairs, consulting with the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to inspect and release the goods, in order to maintain the circulation of commodities.

### Japanese Garrison at the Intersection of Shangchuan Road and Caojia Road Annihilated

Chinese Troops Attack at Night, Cutting Military Telephone Lines; Only Two or Three Japanese Troops Escape

A fierce battle occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops at the intersection of Caojia Road and the town of Jinjia Bridge on the Shangchuan Railway line in Pudong at around 9:00 PM the night before last. The battle at Caojia Road was fierce, with booming artillery fire lasting for two hours. Of the Japanese soldiers guarding the town, only two or three escaped alive. Six or seven were killed on the spot,

and the rest were captured, almost all annihilated. Four puppet "police" also died from bullets. This was the first most glorious victory for the Chinese troops since the August 13th Memorial Day and National Day Memorial last year. At 9:00 PM that night, more than 100 Chinese troops, using light and agile night marches, suddenly appeared around Caojia Road Town. First, they cut the Japanese military telephone lines and then advanced to Cao Town from the east and west, surrounding the area near the station.

Japanese stronghold. In the eyes of the Japanese army, the town was more important, so more than 20 soldiers were regularly stationed there day and night. At that time, several sentries were lying in ambush inside the sandbag defenses, and the rest were sleeping. In the darkness, the Chinese troops fired concentrated machine gun fire, and the Japanese sentries quickly returned fire. The remaining Japanese soldiers woke up in fright and scrambled to fight back, but the Chinese troops were heavily surrounded on all sides. The Japanese army dragged out small steel cannons, regarding them as a relied-upon weapon, and frequently opened fire to show force. For a time,

the sound of artillery boomed, alarming those far and near. The eight puppet "police" (the puppet "police" there had already been issued guns) were also forced to fight. After about two hours of fighting, seven or eight Japanese soldiers and four puppet "police" were killed. Because the telephone lines were cut, there were no reinforcements for the Japanese army. Fighting until their voices were hoarse and exhausted, the Chinese troops bravely charged into the Japanese stronghold. Fourteen wounded Japanese soldiers were captured on the spot. Only two or three uninjured soldiers took off their uniforms and escaped in the confusion. After the Chinese troops obtained a

major victory, they destroyed the Japanese fortifications and triumphantly withdrew with the prisoners. At the same time, at around 9:00 PM in the Jinjia Bridge area, dozens of guerrillas attacked the town. There were only eight Japanese soldiers stationed in Jin Town. One was killed on the spot, and the rest fled back to Yanpu Bian Gao Miao Town. The Chinese troops did not pursue and retreated immediately. After dawn yesterday morning, the Japanese army's Kawashima Zhihiro headquarters in Chuansha was greatly alarmed, but because the situation in Chuancheng was tense and there were fewer than 100 Japanese soldiers stationed there, it was impossible to dispatch troops. As a result,

there were no troops stationed in Cao Town. They urgently requested 20 soldiers from the 70-man Ogawa unit of the Japanese guard force at the Nanmatou in the South Huangpu, who reluctantly took two small steel cannons and several machine guns and boarded a small boat. At 11:00 AM, they were transported to the Gaomiao ferry to disembark and then took the Shangchuan train to Caojia Road to take over the defense. Therefore, the situation on Shangchuan Road was tense yesterday. In the past, each bus had at least 200 to 300 passengers, with similar numbers going up and down. But yesterday, each bus had only 20 to 30 people, and the total business for the day was less than one-tenth of the usual.

### Flour Mills and Grain Merchants Purchase 100,000 Tons of Foreign Wheat; Transported to Shanghai in Batches; Third Batch Changed Ports Yesterday; Expected to be Fully Transported Before the End of May

Shanghai is the center of the national flour industry and is no less than an area where wheat from all over the country gathers. After the war, the Chinese government banned the transport of wheat to Shanghai, and wheat in the war zone was under Japanese control, making transport to Shanghai difficult. Flour mills in the concessions had no choice but to order from foreign countries due to the shortage of raw materials, totaling approximately 100,000 tons, which were transported to Shanghai in batches. The details are as follows:

Wheat Shortage: Flour mills are the main customers of wheat. Therefore, in addition to wheat purchased through introductions from trading organizations, Shanghai factories also directly purchase wheat by setting up wheat purchasing offices in various wheat-producing areas. After the war, the Chinese government banned the export of wheat and re-export to occupied areas. As a result, wheat from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and other provinces could not be transported to Shanghai, and it was difficult for manufacturers to purchase wheat in the war zone around North China and Shanghai. As a result, all flour mills within the concessions were in a panic due to a shortage of raw materials, and all flour

production could not be fully started.

Ordering Foreign Wheat: Shanghai Fuxin, Fuxin, and other flour mills, as well as grain merchants dealing in wheat, had no choice but to order foreign wheat from foreign countries, totaling approximately 100,000 tons, entrusted to Daufu Foreign Firm and others to handle, and transported to Shanghai in batches by American ships. The first batch of 8,353 tons, loaded on the Rugely wheel, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. The second batch of 7,750 tons, loaded on the Harmatris, arrived in Shanghai on February 5. The third batch of 8,383 tons, loaded on the Riler wheel, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, berthing at responsibility Pu River No. 14 and 15 floating cylinder,

shipped in batches. A total of 24,486 tons of foreign wheat in the first, second, and third batches have arrived in Shanghai. The fourth batch of 8,893 tons, loaded on the JantZe, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of February. It is reported that a total of 100,000 tons of foreign wheat will be transported to Shanghai in 10 to 12 batches, and will be fully arrived by the end of May. Most of these foreign wheat is used to supply flour mills such as Fuxin and Fuxin in the concessions for flour production, which is the first sign of manufacturers ordering foreign wheat after the war.

### Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Sends Condolences to Mr. Little

Mr. E.S. Little served as a director of the Shanghai Municipal Council many years ago. Unfortunately, he passed away in New Zealand three days ago. The colleagues of the bureau were deeply saddened upon learning of this. Yesterday, the chairman of the bureau, Fanklin, sent a letter to his son to express condolences and show mourning.

### Soybean and Rice Industry Association Makes Every Effort to Stabilize Rice Prices; Japanese Mass Purchases Reduce Stockpiles Day by Day; Authorities of Both Concessions Attach Great Importance

National rice in the war zone is subject to mass purchases by North China merchants colluding with the Japanese side, and transported to Shanghai for loading on Japanese ships for private export. As a result, stockpiles in the war zone production areas are decreasing day by day, and rice prices are rising. Fortunately, there are sufficient stocks of rice in Shanghai, and there is no immediate fear of shortages. However, if this continues for a long time, it will be affected. Yesterday, it was learned from the rice market that the price of rice in Shanghai has been rising due to the scarcity of arrivals and the approaching Lunar New Year. The price of top-grade white rice has risen to twelve yuan and eight jiao. The Soybean and Rice Industry Association has ordered the market management committee to make every effort to stabilize rice prices and find ways to dredge the source. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Board of Directors attach great importance to the price of rice in Shanghai, as it concerns people's livelihood, and have sent personnel to investigate rice stocks within the boundary to avoid the same unfortunate event as at the end of the previous year.

### Various Transportation and Sales Offices in Wenzhou Cable Requesting Exemption from the Prohibition of Exporting Six Kinds of Native Goods; Adjustment Office Orders Transportation and Sales Offices to Collect as Usual to Maintain the Market

After the Ouhai Customs in various counties under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou received instructions from the Ministry of Finance prohibiting the export of goods, the various transportation and sales offices requested the authorities to consider accommodating and handling the matter, as it concerned the future of their business. After discussing relief measures, the various transportation and sales offices decided to cable the Ministry of Finance, requesting that native paper, timber, planks, fresh eggs, charcoal, and domestically sold tea leaves produced in various places under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou be exempted from the prohibition of transportation. It has been requested that the wartime property adjustment office forward it to the Ministry of Finance for verification. Now, the adjustment office has ordered the various transportation and sales offices to continue collecting various goods as usual to maintain the market.

### Japanese Attempt to Seize: Cheng Kee Shipping Six Vessels Anchored in Port Damaged by Storms; Rumors of Sale in Shanghai Not Confirmed

The main office of Cheng Kee Shipping Company is located in Yantai, with branches and offices in various coastal locations. It has a total of 24 ships, including Gan Li, Kun Li, etc. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the coast has been blockaded by Japanese warships. All of the company's ships have been forced to cease operations. With the exception of Hong Li, which was seized in Qingdao for blockade purposes, six ships including Feng Li, Sheng Li, and Mao Li are anchored in Hong Kong. Rumors circulated that the six vessels anchored in Hong Kong had been sold to the Japanese. Crew members had reportedly agreed to resign and telegraphed for appeals. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with maritime circles yesterday and learned that Cheng Kee Company has a branch office in Shanghai, located on Rue du Sacré-Cœur in the French Concession. The manager, Wang Bofen, is a member of the Shipping Industry Association. He had not received any reports from the head office regarding the sale of the six vessels anchored in Hong Kong to the Japanese side. However, according to speculation, it is definitely not true. The Japanese have repeatedly attempted to seize the aforementioned six vessels anchored in Hong Kong without success. Some of the vessels were damaged during a typhoon while anchored in Hong Kong and are currently undergoing repairs. The tonnage of the six vessels ranges from 1,800 to 3,200 tons each.

### Trade Association Forms Fundraising Committee: Fundraising to Proceed; First Meeting Held Yesterday; Procedures to be Drafted

Refugee Products: Citizen Shen Linxi suggested yesterday to the Refugee Relief Association that they implement a practical plan to assist refugees outside of the shelters by accepting their products. The methods include: Accepting these products through established refugee product sales outlets, or having the Association commission enthusiastic relief-minded businesses as agents; Selling the products, retail or wholesale, with the Association acting as an agent, taking a reasonable handling fee, giving a portion to the commissioned sellers, and using the remainder for refugee shelter donations; The acceptance and sale of these products will be publicly announced in the newspapers once the preparatory procedures are completed.

Collecting Medicine for Relief: The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association issued an appeal to its members, stating that since the war began, countless compatriots have been displaced and become refugees. In Shanghai alone, there are hundreds of thousands. They often suffer from hunger and cold, leading to illness, which can be seen everywhere. Many die because they have nowhere to get treatment or lack medicine. Although various charitable organizations are providing assistance to refugees with illnesses, and various sectors of society are providing relief to refugees in need, we know that the need for relief, especially medical care, is still pressing, both in the interior and in the city. Refugees are all descendants of the Chinese nation, all part of the nation's strength. How can we turn a blind eye to their suffering? Our relief efforts cannot be a one-time or isolated event. The new pharmaceutical industry in this city has a considerable presence. During the war, our members have fulfilled part of our duty to help refugees, but it is still not enough. For the sake of humanity and the future of our country, we, the new pharmaceutical industry, should more actively and broadly engage in relief efforts. At the same time, based on the principle advocated by our supreme leader of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength," we, the new pharmaceutical industry, should each do our best to serve the country and strive together for a bright future for the nation, which is also striving for the future of our own industry. Therefore, we have launched this "medicine collection for relief" campaign to harness the power of our new pharmaceutical industry to help refugees and fulfill our duty as citizens to the country. We, the members of the new pharmaceutical industry, are all patriots with a strong sense of national consciousness and a strong sense of humanity and justice. We believe that this "medicine collection for relief" will receive widespread support and promotion. We extend our hands warmly, looking forward to the enthusiastic participation of our fellow members of the new pharmaceutical industry.

Verifying Donations: The Refugee Relief Association sent a letter to the hotel, restaurant, and Western restaurant associations yesterday, stating that their efforts in handling refugee relief funds since the fifth [month, year unspecified] have been commendable and deeply appreciated. The Association has been in contact with municipal authorities in the concessions and will conduct its own audits to establish direct contact for administrative purposes and avoid procedural difficulties. Starting February 1st, the Association will dispatch Yan Yilin, Wu Jiaqi, Zhang Zhongyu, Yao Qiuyuan, Zhang Bofang, Yuan Hongjun, Zhang Xingfu, and Li Ziyang as auditors to various locations to verify donation amounts. They request that the respective associations send representatives to assist and inform their members to provide assistance and convenience as needed. Furthermore, the Restaurant Association has collected 50,596.23 yuan in refugee donations since collecting the 105th [iteration, year unspecified] donation, until the end of January. In order to encourage fundraising efforts by its members, the association has requested the Association to award the best performers after the fundraising campaign is concluded.

### Japanese Financial Difficulties: More "Yen" to be Issued; Continuing Issuance of 300 Million or 500 Million Yen; Fierce Debate Over Increasing Reserve Funds

According to the "Continental News," the "Japan Chronicle" reports that a proposal to further amend the Bank of Japan Law will be submitted to the current session of the Diet. The new bill seeks to authorize the Bank of Japan to continue issuing banknotes worth 300 million or 500 million yen. In the last session of the Diet, the limit had already been increased from 1 billion yen to 1.7 billion yen. With a gold reserve of 80.1 million yen, the bank could issue banknotes up to 2.5 billion yen without paying special taxes. However, Japan established a foreign exchange program in July last year and withdrew 300 million yen from the gold reserve. Therefore, today the maximum amount of banknotes the bank can issue without paying taxes is 2.2 billion yen. By the end of last year, the issued banknotes had exceeded the limit by 600 million yen. Since the beginning of this year, the Bank of Japan has rapidly withdrawn the issued banknotes, but in view of the continued increase in military spending, it is widely believed that the amount of currency in circulation will gradually increase. Therefore, the financial authorities believe it is necessary to increase the limit for secured reserve funds. There are differing opinions regarding the amount of the increase. Some believe that since the reserve has been reduced by 300 million yen, the reserve and banknotes should be increased by an equal amount. Others insist on a substantial increase. The financial authorities oppose any drastic increase, as it would easily lead to inflation. The general opinion is to stipulate an increase of 500 million yen. In that case, the new limit would be 2.2 billion yen, or a total of 2.7 billion yen including the gold reserve.

### Japanese Newspaper Reports: Accuses Concession Authorities of Applying Pressure; Claims Japanese Citizens Encounter Difficulties Purchasing Gasoline; Chinese Drivers Also Subjected to Discrimination

The "Continental News" reports that yesterday (February 6th), the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" claimed that Chinese chauffeurs employed by Japanese citizens are subjected to unreasonable and slow pass inspections, and merchants refuse to sell gasoline to them, indicating "pressure" applied by authorities in the two concessions. It is often heard from Japanese citizens traveling south of Hongkou that they have encountered such "ill-treatment," and Japanese automobile businesses also complain of suffering such "ill-treatment." The newspaper cited a specific example, stating that a Chinese chauffeur employed by Japanese architect Okano, residing at 502 Rue de Dieppe, was stopped and interrogated by a patrolman in the French Concession, who then tore up the chauffeur's pass. The search ended thereafter. The newspaper concluded that if such a situation continues, Japanese residents in Hongkou may be forced not to drive their cars into the concession area.

### Quanguang Silk Factory: Labor Strike Escalates; Direct Labor-Management Negotiations Fail; Decision Made to Petition Ratepayers' Meeting

Following the strike by all workers at the Quanguang Silk Factory on Route Kaufmann in Western Shanghai, direct negotiations between labor and management failed. The labor side claims that the management disregarded government labor protection laws, took advantage of the situation, continued to arrest worker Wan A’tu, and continued to dismiss workers Wang Zhengdong and Li Yuanfu, blatantly threatening a return to work. This provoked the anger of all workers, who decided to immediately petition the Shanghai Municipal Council Ratepayers' Meeting and other organizations, demanding justice and assistance.

### Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to French Municipal Council Requesting Exemption from Increased Pawnshop Tax

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stated that according to a report from the Pawnshop Association, starting from January of this year, the Municipal Council's Tax Bureau suddenly increased the monthly business tax for pawnshops within the concession by 30% to 50% of the original amount. There was no prior notification, and the increase was arbitrary. This move is unfair. In recent years, the pawnshop business has been slow, and expenses have increased. They are already struggling to maintain operations. Once again, they are being burdened by heavy taxes. How can they bear it? They requested that measures be taken to negotiate an exemption. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the interest rates charged by pawnshops have always been limited and cannot be developed in an abnormal manner by taking advantage of the situation. This is a factual situation. After August 13th [likely referring to the Battle of Shanghai in 1937], the Municipal Council added a 10% surtax for defense purposes, which the industry has already struggled to bear. Now, another 30% to 50% increase is truly unsustainable. Citizens should pay taxes fairly and equitably based on their ability to pay. This principle should be considered by the Municipal Council. Therefore, based on the above situation, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, requesting that the newly proposed tax increase be exempted.

### Wanxian Red Swastika Society: Efforts in Relief Work; Relief Work Commenced in Guanchang and Shashi

### Japanese Daizhi Bus: Intercepted in Nanxiang; Passengers Afraid to Ride

A bus owned by the Japanese Daizhi Company, operating on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, was suddenly intercepted on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at around 3:00 PM near Nanxiang Station, which belongs to Jiading County, by dozens of guerrillas from Deng Jinglie's troops who were lying in ambush by the side of the road. Dozens of shots were fired, shattering the bus windows. The Japanese soldiers escorting the bus, seeing the unfavorable situation, returned fire while ordering the driver to accelerate and escape. The passengers inside the bus all lay down on the seats at the time, avoiding injury. Since this incident, passengers are afraid to ride the bus for safety reasons, and business has sharply declined.

### British Yongzhen Vessel Detained: Japan Protests to Britain; Claims Interference with Qingdao Customs Duties

The Yangzhen vessel, owned by the British Xia Laochen Foreign Firm, was loaded with goods in Shanghai and sailed to Funing Hexingzhen on January 24. It was suddenly searched on January 27 by the Haiyan vessel, a patrol boat from Qingdao Customs, in the Sheyang River, six [Chinese unit of distance] from Lianyungang off Hexingzhen.

### Two Assassination Cases Yesterday: Zhou Jitang and Gu Chongxi; Both Killed by Gunshots

Zhou Was the Head of the Puppet "Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui Tin Foil Tax Bureau"; A Japanese Pass and Other Items Were Found on Gu

From 9:10 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday, two more assassinations occurred in the Shanghai Public Concession. One victim was Zhou Jitang, the head of the puppet "Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui Tin Foil Tax Bureau," and the other was a Cantonese named Gu Chongxi. The details of each case are as follows:

Zhou Jitang:

Zhou Jitang, a native of Liyang, was 37 years old. Because he had lived in Suzhou for a long time, he always claimed to be from Wuxian. His wife, Sun, is 29 years old. They lived at No. 8 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road. It is said that he obtained the position of head of the puppet "Tin Foil Tax Bureau" purely due to the recommendation of Yan Jiachi, the puppet "Deputy Minister of Finance." In addition, he also served as an advisor to the puppet "Salt Affairs Inspection Office." Since taking this puppet position, Zhou has extensively collected money and extorted merchants, causing general business people to suffer greatly. Yesterday, at around 9:10 AM, Zhou Jitang received a phone call at home instructing him to go to the puppet "Bureau" quickly to handle important official matters. At the time, Zhou was wearing a fancy Western suit, with a gray squirrel and otter fur collar overcoat. He boarded his own car (license No. 3358), driven by his chauffeur, Li Jinsheng. When passing Gordon Road on Xinzha Road, three men suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Two of them drew out handguns and approached Zhou from behind, shooting at him. One shot hit Zhou in the back of the neck, and he immediately bled profusely and fell onto the car. The chauffeur, Li Jinsheng, experienced a near-death experience and fled in terror. The assassins remained calm and walked forward. After confirming that Zhou was no longer breathing, they left a note reading "You are a traitor" on Zhou's car and then escaped. Shortly after, the patrol officers arrived after hearing the alert, but the assassins had already disappeared without a trace. They reported to the police station and summoned an ambulance to take Zhou to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, because the injury was to a vital spot, he died soon after. The bullet remained near his nose. The hospital transferred the body to the coroner's office. Police detectives found many cards with his aforementioned puppet titles, a round-trip Wuxi permit issued by the Japanese, 160 yuan in cash, and a checkbook from a major bank, among his belongings. Furthermore, it is rumored that when Zhou's body arrived at the [missing character] hospital, an old woman accompanied him, but left without saying goodbye. Therefore, her name and identity are unknown. Everything is under investigation by the police.

Gu Chongxi:

Approximately from 11:40 AM yesterday, after the Zhou Jitang case occurred, another bloodshed case happened at a restaurant on Nanjing Road. It is said that at around 11:30 AM, seven Chinese men went straight to the second floor and found seats to eat. One of them was wearing a Western suit, speaking Cantonese, and was about 40 years old. The others were all speaking Min dialect and were all adults. They sat at table number 29. The Cantonese speaker instructed the waiter to prepare a 5-yuan meal. After speaking, he got up and went to the telephone by the stairs to make a phone call. It is said that the number he dialed was 93260 (East Asia Hotel). While he was on the phone, a man in a Zhongshan suit suddenly drew out a handgun and ran forward, shooting at him. The bullet hit the man in the Western suit in the head, and he fell to the ground. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the shooter left a letter next to the injured man and beckoned to the others at the table. They all rushed downstairs. Upon reaching the ground floor, another shot was fired as a warning. The bullet pierced the display window glass and landed on a pile of glutinous rice cakes on the counter. They then calmly escaped. The Laozha patrol station received the news and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate and search, but found nothing. Only a letter with the words "Fosheng Electrical Company, Zhabei Road" written on the cover was found at the scene. They urgently summoned an ambulance to transport the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, he died en route due to serious injuries. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for autopsy. Police detectives found six business cards with the name "Cen Dongdao" written on them, with "Dongdao Society, Sangguang Town, Shiba District, Tokyo" and "No. 505 Desiwei Road, Shanghai Peace Manor, Telephone 45927" printed on the bottom left corner. In addition, there was a permit issued by the Japanese, with the name Gu Chongxi on it. His relationship and puppet position are currently under investigation.

### Flower Club "Sailing Vessel" Cracked Down on Aixi Road: Two Flower Club Criminals Sentenced; More Than Ten Gamblers Fined

At No. 56, Lane 1337, Aixi Road, Gu A'er and others recently established a "sailing vessel" gambling den to lure gamblers to a flower club. Their gambling tactics were more sophisticated than any other recently arrested "sailing vessel" criminals. Therefore, they collected gambling money three times a day, morning, noon, and night, often amounting to 400 to 500 yuan. It was not until the day before yesterday that patrol officers from Chengdu Road became aware of this and sent a large team of Chinese and Western detectives, driving armed cars, to search and arrest. As soon as they entered the door, they were spotted by Ma Lesheng, hired by Gu as an assistant. He immediately threw the flower club papers into the stove to burn them. The detectives stopped him, but most of them had already turned to ashes. Only 60 to 70 sheets remained unburned. Gu and Ma, along with sixteen men and women who were gambling, and the gambling money, were taken to the police station. According to their confessions, the main flower club was located in Caojiadu, and the other three people in charge have escaped. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the Police Station filed a lawsuit according to law, requesting that they be severely punished. Judge Meng ruled that Gu A'er be sentenced to ten months' imprisonment, Ma Rongsheng to eight months' imprisonment, and the remaining ten be fined 20 yuan each or sentenced to 20 days of labor each. The gambling money and flower club papers were confiscated.

### Co-Heir Burned to Death: Relatives Accuse Factory Owner of Death by Negligence

Liu Qizhou, owner of the Yongfeng Wenji Hardware and Electrical Factory on Weihaiwei Road, has recently been accused of death by negligence and other charges by Wang Haiqian, who retained a lawyer and filed a case with the criminal division of the First Special Court. The plaintiff stated that his son, Qiaosheng, 16 years old, was an apprentice in the defendant's factory. At around 5:00 AM on December 24th last year, a fire broke out in the factory. Qiaosheng heard the alarm and immediately called his companions to report to the factory owner, Liu Qizhou (because the Liu family also lived in the factory). Liu ordered Qiaosheng and others to move important books and documents from the accounting room, back and forth several times. On the last trip, he was lost in the smoke and burned to death (four other apprentices were also burned to death). Afterwards, Liu hired workers to retrieve four bodies. Upon hearing the news, the plaintiff went to the factory, which was already a pile of rubble. The body was sent to the coroner's office and placed in the Xihai Funeral Home, but he refused to claim it. Qiaosheng was the co-heir of the plaintiff and his brother's families, and his 80-year-old grandmother was still alive. Upon hearing the tragic news, she was overwhelmed with grief. The defendant knew that the fire was already dangerous, yet he still asked them to move items, resulting in this tragic death. This constitutes a violation of Articles 282 and 491 of the Criminal Code, and it is requested that the defendant be ordered to pay 400 yuan per year until the age of 60, totaling 17,600 yuan. Yesterday morning, the case was interrogated by Judge Chuan. The defendant retained Lawyer E Sen to defend him. As a result, Liu Qizhou was found not guilty, and the attached civil lawsuit was dismissed.

### Gathering in Tea House: Plotting Illegal Activities; Detectives Arrest Suspects; Handguns and Bullets Seized

Zhou Honglin, a Chinese detective in the general inspection department of the Public Concession police, learned that several members of a robbery gang were planning to gather at the Jubao Lou teahouse at No. 411 Shanhaiguan Road yesterday to plot illegal activities. He reported this to Liu Shaokui, the chief Chinese detective, and together with Chinese detective Zhu Shuling, they rushed to arrest three men from Jiangbei, Lu Yuanyu, Hu Debiao, and Yan Deyin, on the 6th. A large-caliber "lotus seed" handgun and three bullets were found on Lu's person. Later, Chen Xianghui, an accomplice, was arrested at the intersection of Kade Road and Xinzha Road. It was found that they had robbed property from No. 51, Lane 417, Xiaoshadu Road, and No. 403, Xinjiapo Road, and the Yihe Pawnshop. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested a postponement of the hearing, stating that further investigation was needed to apprehend other accomplices. After a brief hearing, Judge Feng ordered that they be detained temporarily and the hearing be postponed.

### From a Young Age, Engaged by Matchmakers; Now Seeking to Dissolve the Engagement: Zhu Qiutao Dissatisfied with Fiancee; Jurisdictional Issues Require Evidence

Song Xiuzhu, younger sister of Song Zhenhua, a post office employee from Chuansha working in the French Concession on Rue Massenet, was betrothed to Zhu Qiutao, a fellow townsman with the surname Zhu, by her parents through matchmakers when she was young. At that time, Qiutao was only ten years old. Both children were ignorant and never expressed any opinions. Later, as they grew older, they maintained regular correspondence and never showed any dislike. Now that they are both adults, Zhu Qiutao

Suddenly Raises Objections

Repeatedly seeking to dissolve the engagement. However, due to the other party's disagreement, the matter remained unresolved. After the war, the counties in Pudong fell into enemy hands, and the Zhu family moved to No. 11 Kangti Lane, Kangti Road, in the French Concession of this city. Recently, they learned that the fiancee, Song Xiuzhu, had also sought refuge in Shanghai and was living with her brother at No. 512 Xin Dagulu in the International Settlement. Consequently, they hired lawyer Qian Zheng to file a petition with the First Special District Court, seeking

Mediation to Annul the Agreement

However, the mediation failed because Miss Song could not be served with the summons. Lawyer Qian then represented his client in filing a lawsuit against Miss Song, seeking confirmation that the engagement was invalid. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni opened the court to summon the defendant. Miss Song Xiuzhu still did not appear in court, but her lawyer appeared and stated that the case's jurisdiction

Still Had Issues

And requested that this point be investigated first, because the defendant still resides in her hometown with her widowed mother. However, the plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendant's lawyer was engaging in

Empty Claims

Saying that there was a witness who could prove that the defendant was indeed living with her brother, Song Zhenhua, on Xin Dagulu. Zhang, who lived in the same house as the plaintiff, testified in court that he had gone to Song Zhenhua's residence and saw Song Xiuzhu in the house. The court then ordered the defendant's lawyer to present evidence regarding the jurisdictional issue and adjourned the hearing to February 14th.

### Pudong Wharf Laborer Shot and Killed; Japanese Troops Indiscriminately Fired on the Innocent

Wang Quansheng, a native of Shandong, was 48 years old. He had been working as a laborer at various shipping wharves in Pudong. He lived at No. 25 Renheli, Xicun Lane, Zhoujiadu, Pudong. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 8:00 PM, during the Japanese troops' curfew hours, when people were prohibited from traveling at night, Wang was passing by the entrance of Xicun Lane, Zhoujiadu, near his residence. A Japanese soldier spotted him and, considering his appearance suspicious, opened fire without asking any questions. He was shot in the waist and fell to the ground. Wang, though wounded, crawled back to his residence. Due to the late hour and the Japanese troops' curfew in the area, and the lack of nearby hospitals, his family only managed to help him cross the river to Shanghai the next day and hire a car to take him to Yihe Hospital at No. 200 Rue Albert in the French Concession for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 5:00 PM. The hospital reported the death to the French police as usual, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, the French police reported the case to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor went to the hall, confirming that the deceased, Wang Quansheng, died from a gunshot wound. Wang Liu, the deceased's wife, filed a report requesting to claim the body for burial after signing a guarantee.

### Robbery in the Village of Fahua: Several Homes Robbed in One Night

### Village Woman Seduced into Adultery; Accuses Foreman of Abandonment; Demanding Payment for Living and Educational Expenses for Mother and Daughters; Foreman Denies Allegations, Court Orders Out-of-Court Mediation

Liang Lu (also known as A Yi), a 32-year-old Guangdong woman residing at No. 361 Beijiangxi Road, recently hired lawyer Gan Lin to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Liang Deqiang, a Cantonese man residing at No. 72 behind the Daxin Company on Rue Lloyd, of seduction and abandonment. The grounds for the lawsuit were that the plaintiff was an uneducated, old-fashioned village woman with limited knowledge. Over ten years ago, she came to Shanghai with relatives and was

Seduced Into Adultery

By the defendant, who was from the same hometown, and began cohabitating. They had a daughter. However, the defendant became bored over time and abandoned her once. The plaintiff, without means of support, formally married Gu Tingguang, a fellow townsman. However, the defendant, who was a foreman at the Ruirong Iron Factory in Yangshupu, became jealous upon learning of the plaintiff's marriage and wanted to rekindle their relationship. Relying on his large group of followers and ample resources, he repeatedly threatened and beat the plaintiff's husband, threatening to kill him. The husband,

Unable to Endure the Suffering

Reached a settlement through mediation, with the defendant providing funds for him to return to Guangdong to avoid conflict. She then resumed cohabitation with the defendant, bearing one son and two daughters. Besides one son and one daughter who died young, there are now a seven-year-old eldest daughter and a three-year-old youngest daughter. If they could live together from then on, it would have been somewhat comforting. However, the defendant relapsed and, in August of the lunar calendar this year, abandoned her again, leaving the mother and three daughters without regard for their livelihood. For months, they have been displaced and suffered greatly.

Lives in Danger

The defendant's actions constitute crimes under Articles 293 and 294 of the Criminal Code. She also requested that the court order a one-time payment of 3,360 yuan, the minimum living expenses of ten yuan per month until she reaches the age of sixty, and child support of five yuan per month for both daughters until they reach adulthood, totaling 780 yuan for the eldest daughter and 1,020 yuan for the youngest daughter, for a total of 5,160 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng summoned the plaintiff, Liang Lu, and her two daughters to court. She testified as before. The defendant, accompanied by a lawyer, also appeared in court and

Denied the Allegations

Stating that the plaintiff and defendant were originally from the same hometown and known to each other. After she came to Shanghai, she first cohabited with Lu Ning for several years, and then became acquainted with Gu Tingguang. Gu, being a small vendor, had insufficient income, so the plaintiff would occasionally borrow money from the defendant. Later, the defendant refused, leading to the lawsuit out of resentment, etc. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Huang ordered the case to be rescheduled to the 16th for both parties to mediate out of court. If mediation fails, further review will be conducted.

### Former Capital Ballroom Accused in Two Cases

When Yongbo youth rich businessman Chuan Xuelin, namely Chuan Zhuangnian, and his fellow townsman Zhang Shaozong, namely Jiang Xiaozhong, jointly opened the Dujing ballroom on Malong Road in the French Concession, Zhang Qian was appointed manager, Chuan served as an assistant, and lawyer Ji Chao was appointed legal advisor, also entrusted with handling litigation matters during the business operation. Nearly 500 yuan of public expenses were not paid, because the ballroom closed after operating for less than two months. The attorney's fees owed to Ji were not paid, despite repeated letters requesting payment, Now, lawyer Ji Chao has filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special Court, requesting mediation with Chuan Xuelin and Zhang Shaozong, seeking payment of the legal fees. The court accepted the petition, and yesterday morning, Judge Chen opened the court for mediation. Because the opposing parties, Chuan and Zhang, did not appear, the court ordered the mediation to fail and instructed the petitioner to formally file a lawsuit. Chuan and Zhang were also sued in the Second Special Court for owing debts to the La Dahua Ballroom, which they have not paid. The original and defendant parties have been served summonses and are scheduled to be heard in the Seventh Court tomorrow.

### Barber's Late-Night Noise Leads to Murder; Five Individuals Involved Arrested; Awaiting Autopsy Before Further Interrogation

After finishing work on the evening of the 4th of this month, barbers from a barbershop at No. 665 Hankou Road began singing in various dialects, creating excessive noise. Workers from the Cuihua Printing House, located behind the barbershop at No. 28 Yideli, Zhejiang Road, intending to rest and sleep after a day of hard work, were disturbed by the singing and questioned them, saying that they should not be making such merry at night and disturbing people's sleep. The barbers, unwilling to back down, argued and insulted each other. The barbers then rushed into Cuihua Printing House, leading to a major brawl. After the police arrived, they were all arrested and taken to the Laozha police station, where they were scolded by the police chief and released. However, Lin Fusheng (also known as Lin Shiji), one of the barbers, suddenly felt injured afterward and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, he died on the night before last. Five barbers and printing house workers who were related to the case, including Mei Chunhua, Wang Delin, Lu Ziquan, Yang Sanduo, and Zhu Shengzhang, were arrested.

### Fake "City Government Secretary" Kidnapped; Still Missing Yesterday; Two Strong Men Helped Him Into a Car; So-Called Captain is a Fang

Tang Wenwu, the fake "City Government Secretary," who is over fifty years old, originally lived in Fanli, Pudong. After the fake "City Government" moved to Jiangwan, Tang also moved to Hongkou. The day before yesterday morning, Tang and Chen Boqiao, a fake official from the fake "Social Affairs Bureau," were next to the fake "Bus Stop" north of the Waitanyuan Bridge, planning to take a bus to the fake "City Government," when two strong men suddenly approached Tang. They claimed to be dismissed fake "Guard Team police officers" and said that, according to orders from above, they requested he accompany them for a conversation. Tang asked what it was about, but the two men did not answer. They only produced a letter from their sleeves and handed it to Tang to read. After Tang finished reading, he tried to escape, but the two strong men drew their guns, ordered him to stop, and helped him into a car that was parked on the side of the road, which then sped away. Although Chen, the fake official, was not kidnapped, he was glared at, scaring him into running away. Since this incident occurred, the fake "City Government" and other collaborators have become panicked. As of last night, the fake "Secretary" was still missing. It was reported that when the incident occurred, the two strong men said, "Our Captain Fang wants to see you." Therefore, it is known that the so-called captain is named Fang. The Japanese and puppet authorities have been investigating for two days without any leads.

### Police Bust Large-Scale Coal Thieves; "Floating Dock" Intercepted in Suzhou Creek; Large Quantities of Stolen Coal and Account Books Seized

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the westward relocation of the National Army, more than ten fugitives from Tongzhou, including Mu Jiang, Zhu Xigen, and Zhong Agen, seized the opportunity to organize a large-scale theft operation at No. 7, Lane 476, North Suzhou Road.

The original letter stated, "To whom it may concern, I found a check on Avenue Edward VII yesterday. I do not know who lost it, and I dare not take what is not rightfully mine. Therefore, I am enclosing it to you. After announcing it in the newspaper, please deposit it into the refugee fund to help the refugees. I am enclosing the check and ask your newspaper to announce it. Sincerely, Cifu."

This newspaper believes that we cannot simply send the found check to the refugee fund. We must seek the issuer's consent to be legal. However, after investigation, the "China United Business Company" has ceased operations, so this check has become waste paper and cannot be donated to refugees. We hope "Cifu" will come to the office to retrieve the check and send it to the police.

### Paramount Department Store Scheduled to Open on the 10th; Hosted Press Last Night

The Jing'an Temple Paramount Department Store, appearing in a new form, is scheduled to officially open on the 10th of the month (the day after tomorrow). The opening ceremony will be extremely grand. Currently, the interior of the department store is being renovated day and night, and the garden layout is also gradually taking shape. Mr. Yang Cunguo, the manager of the department store, hosted a reception for reporters from major newspapers in Shanghai last night at the Atlantic Restaurant, with about fifty people attending. The event was a great success, and it ended around 9:00 PM. The department store will host a banquet for participating manufacturers at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA tonight, and a banquet for related parties tomorrow night. The following is a transcript of the speech given by Mr. Yang at the beginning of the Paramount Department Store project: The motivation for establishing Paramount Department Store may not be clear to the outside world, who may think this is a speculative business. However, since the War of Resistance began, we have felt the decline of people's livelihood and the abnormal state of commerce. Shanghai now presents a special prosperity, but this is partial and deformed. In particular, consumers feel that their purchasing power is insufficient, which proves that the current prosperity will not last forever. In this concept, we decided to establish this Paramount Department Store. We will cooperate with producers and consumers with 12% sincerity, and at the same time establish a strict lineup of national products, use the lowest-waste price to suit the consumer's purchasing power, and use the most sophisticated goods to meet the needs of all Shanghai people. We also know that the western district is Shanghai's residential area, but the shops are unusually scattered. Occasionally, you have to drive to get what you want. The loss of this car is already considerable, especially in the Caojiadu Robertson Road area. In the case of buses and trolleybuses, it is difficult to get to the east district to buy an item, so we selected the vacant land next to the Paramount Ballroom next to Jing'an Temple and built such a Paramount Department Store. This is the transportation hub, which can bring a lot of convenience to the residents of the western district. Now, the shops participating are the most famous manufacturers, so it can be said that the goods are noble, but the prices are civilianized. We admire Mr. Kuang Zhongmou's perseverance and the spirit of the Penglai Market he hosted. Now that Penglai Market has become a trace of the past, it is really a pity and the most painful thing, so we will move forward with extremely firm aspirations to follow in Mr. Kuang's footsteps and create a new force for the Chinese cargo industry. It is by no means a temporary speculation, especially in this turbulent era. We think that the business community needs this driving force even more.

They arrived in Hanoi on the 23rd and, at the invitation of our Consul and Vice-Consul in Hanoi, competed against local players on the 24th.

### West Youth Basketball: Guoguang Lost to Mai Linghong Yesterday

Chizhi Easily Defeats Zhendan; Youlian Reverses the Situation and Wins

In the three West Youth basketball games last night, Chizhi played against Zhendan first. Zhendan has been repeatedly defeated and is no match for Chizhi. However, their skills have improved recently, and they posed a considerable threat to Chizhi in the first half, trailing by only seven points, 18-25. In the second half, Chizhi performed better and ultimately won 57-32. The match between Mai Hong and Guoguang followed. Mai Hong has been victorious in every match and is considered one of the two giants in the Chinese and Western teams, while Guoguang is one of the three musketeers of the Chinese teams. It was expected that Mai Hong would win against Guoguang, but everyone anticipated a fierce battle. However, Guoguang performed poorly last night, and Mai Ling took advantage of the opportunity, scoring every shot and soaring to a 46-17 lead in the one-sided first half. After switching sides, Guoguang tried hard to rally, and the game became intense, with both sides attacking swiftly. However, due to the excessive points lost in the first half, Guoguang suffered a crushing defeat of 42-75. In the last match, Youlian played against Tianxing. Tianxing led 21-14 in the first half and finished with a total score of 47-38, but Youlian reversed the situation and won.

### Finance: Many Eager to Take Profits; Cash Prices Rise and Then Retreat

Highest Point Reached 2065 Yuan; Over 1200 Taels Traded

Yesterday's cash gold bar market saw volatile fluctuations, with the general trend being strong at first and then weakening. Initially, the momentum from the previous day continued, and news of continued tightness in foreign exchange, coupled with initial reports of strong buying interest in securities, pushed the opening price to 2065 yuan, nearly breaking the high of 2068 yuan on November 28th of last year. Later, however, currency exchange businesses suddenly acted on behalf of clients holding actual capital, trending towards profit-taking, and securities firms also switched from buying to selling, resulting in a sudden sense of oversupply and a price drop. Subsequently, a certain currency exchange business unexpectedly resumed buying, and a certain gold firm continued to purchase aggressively. However, sentiment was affected by news that HSBC was maintaining the bond price at 8 1/8 pence for the British gold market, leading to widespread profit-taking. The securities firms were also very active in short selling, preventing the price from rising. As a result, the price only rose by 3 yuan. The volume of central gold transactions remained high, but there were no significant fluctuations. Trading was brisk, with 1240 taels traded. Jewelry gold prices were raised by 1 yuan in the morning due to the initial strength of the cash gold bar market. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline.

Cash Gold Bar Market Sees New High Price

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially continued the momentum from the previous day, and foreign exchange rates were also reported to be tight. This strengthened market sentiment, and buyers bid 2065 yuan. A small number of sellers bid 70 yuan. At that time, the jewelry firms suddenly dumped their holdings, selling 50 taels to the securities firms at 2065.9 yuan, the opening price, which was 11 yuan higher than the previous day's high. Although foreign exchange rates continued to weaken after the opening, profit-taking emerged. A certain currency exchange business first sold 70 taels on behalf of a client to a certain gold firm at 60 yuan. It also sold 50 taels each to currency exchange firms, securities firms, and jewelry firms, all at 60 yuan. Subsequently, another currency exchange business also sold on behalf of a local client, selling 50 taels each to a certain firm and to fellow businesses at the same price. After this, buyers became scarce, and the price broke below the 60 yuan mark. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a currency exchange business, and currency exchange businesses traded 50 taels among themselves, both at 56 yuan. At that time, a certain gold firm resumed buying, and the price gradually recovered. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels from a securities firm at 58 yuan. A currency exchange firm bought 50 taels from a jewelry firm at 59 yuan. The gold firm then bought 100 taels from a currency exchange firm at 58 yuan. Later, the currency exchange firm sold 50 taels to a jewelry firm at 57 yuan. Another currency exchange firm bought 50 taels from a jewelry firm at 59 yuan. Finally, a gold firm bought 50 taels from a currency exchange firm at 58.5 yuan, the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, news that foreign exchange rates had stopped tightening and begun to strengthen, and that HSBC was maintaining the price of British gold at 8 1/8 pence, slightly weakened market sentiment. However, a certain currency exchange business suddenly resumed large-scale buying. Fortunately, securities firms, jewelry firms, and currency exchange firms were still willing to sell, so there was little change. A certain currency exchange business bought 50 taels from a fellow business at 57 yuan. It then aggressively bought over 200 taels at 57 yuan and 56 yuan, all supplied by securities firms. Later, the securities firms sold 50 taels to a certain currency exchange business at 55.5 yuan, the lowest price. After this, the gold firm resumed buying, and the price stopped falling and began to rise. The gold firm bought 50 taels from a fellow business at 57 yuan. Finally, a certain currency exchange business bought 50 taels from a fellow business at 2057 yuan, the closing price for the evening, 3 yuan higher than the previous day. The price difference for the entire day was 9.5 yuan. The selling price for cash gold at gold firms was 2065 yuan, and the buying price was 2050 yuan. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.

Jewelry Gold Rises to 209 Yuan

The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. When the cash gold bar price broke through the 60 yuan mark at 9:42 AM, the jewelry firms also raised their prices by 1 yuan. Datonghang and Lao Qingyun changed their prices to 209 yuan, while Xinhanghang changed theirs to 207 yuan, buying at 201 yuan.

Pure Gold Continues to Shrink by One and a Half Pence

A London telegram on the 6th reported that British pure gold continued to shrink by one and a half pence per ounce, falling to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold also decreased to 1211.9 yuan. The listed price for Customs gold also decreased slightly by 0.2%, a decrease of 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard spot gold price also fell by 1 yuan, to 1207.4 yuan.

### Japanese Currency Sells Well; External Demand Remains High; Boycott is Just Empty Talk

Yesterday, British pure gold continued to fall by 1.5 pence, and the British-American exchange rate rose by .06875. Foreign exchange rates continued to decline due to strong demand in North China and insufficient supply from banks. The cash gold bar market opened strong, but subsequent profit-taking by gold firms and jewelry businesses caused prices to gradually decline. Later, prices rebounded as firms bought at low prices. Observing the future, gold prices may still experience turbulence. British gold pounds and gold notes were heavily sold, but strong demand continued, and trading was brisk. Japanese gold notes are widely used in the market. There have been reports of a boycott to show retaliation, but most people in the industry are foolish and pursue profits. This talk is probably just idle chatter from patriotic individuals. Public association trading was still strong. Litong sold US gold notes to Yongsheng for 200 yuan. Chengtai sold British gold notes to Tongjin for 100 pounds and also sold British gold notes to Santaijin for 100 pounds. Jindada sold British gold pounds to Hongchangjin for 100 pounds. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British gold pounds rose by 2 jiao and 5 fen, British gold notes rose by 2 jiao and 1 fen, US gold notes rose by 2 fen, Hong Kong notes rose by 7 li, French franc notes rose by 5 hao, Singapore notes and Dutch notes each rose by 2 fen, Canadian notes rose by 2 fen, and Philippine notes rose by 3.5 fen. Italian notes fell by 1 fen. Only US gold pounds, Annam notes, rupee notes, German gold notes, Australian gold notes, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.

### Significant Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Rates; Heavy Settlement Volume and Influx of Outsiders; Tight to Loose, British Tight and American Flat

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw heavy settlement volumes from major oil and shipping companies, along with continued buying activity from Japanese banks. Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and Chinese yarn and cloth businesses also suddenly began buying, leading to potentially tight conditions. The British gold rate once fell to 8 1/8 pence, and the US exchange rate also weakened to 15.84375 yuan. However, the market eventually loosened as foreign banks competed to supply currency. As a result, the British rate tightened by .03125, while the US rate remained unchanged. However, there were significant fluctuations throughout the day, and trading remained brisk. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to decline by .00375 due to weak selling interest from currency exchange businesses and strong buying interest from foreign banks.

In the early morning, London's large bills, both near and far, were flat, and New York's silver prices remained unchanged. London's raw gold continued to shrink by 1.5 pence. The British-American exchange rate was up 5.6 cents, the British-French rate was up 10 centimes, and the British-Shanghai rate was down .0625. The American-British rate was up 5.6 cents, the American-French rate was up .25, and the American-Shanghai rate was down 1 jiao and 9 fen. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks opened early, and the spot selling prices were: British exchange 8 1/8 pence, American exchange 15.9375 yuan, up .03125 from the previous closing price for both British and American. After the opening, Chinese yarn and cloth businesses first bought HSBC British gold at 8 1/8 pence. Then, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and Asiatic settled with HSBC Huabi British gold at 8 1/8 pence, weakening the market to 8 1/4. The HSBC listing was unchanged, and there were no changes in the silver balance tax. After that, a certain shipping company and Japanese banks bought and settled HSBC American Bank Huabi American exchange at 15.9375 yuan, tightening the market to 15.9. Then, Texaco and Mobil also competed to buy profitable American Bank American exchange at only 15.9, tightening the market to 15.84375 yuan. Later, a certain shipping company bought HSBC British gold at only 8 1/8 pence, making the market quite tight. Finally, currency exchange businesses sold Dutch and Hong Kong exchanges to Ander at 54.5 yuan and .00625. The trend then gradually flattened.

Later, the Ge-Yangxing shipping company bought profitable Macalari British gold at 8 1/8 pence. Later, the market loosened slightly as foreign banks continued to supply currency and buying and settlement activity decreased. HSBC sold British gold to a shipping company at 8 1/8 pence. Following that, Dutch and American banks also sold American exchange to a shipping company at 15.9. Because foreign banks were eager to buy and currency exchange businesses were unwilling to sell cheaply, the Hong Kong exchange rate was slightly higher. Huayi bought Hong Kong exchange from a currency exchange business at 54.7. At the close of the evening, the bank selling prices were British exchange 8 1/8 and American exchange 15.9, down .03125 for British and flat for American from the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was down .00375. A record of the day's trading is listed below.

### Discount Rates Lower

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills and notes became progressively lower. In the morning, it was as low as 34.75 yuan per 1000 yuan, 35 yuan at noon, and it fell again in the afternoon, dropping to a low of 34.5 yuan at one point. Finally, it was 34.75 yuan, down another half yuan from the 7th.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Both Flat

A London telegram on the 6th reported that India was buying and the mainland was selling, with buyers being content and the market stable. The market was slightly sluggish after the close. The long-term silver contracts, both near and far, were unchanged. A New York silver telegram reported that the American silver price remained stable. Also, a Bombay silver telegram reported that the Indian silver market was calm, with both spot and near-term contracts unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Trend Lower Again; Foreign Bonds Continue to Rise; Huashang Cement Pays Dividend of 16%; Anglo-German Continued Loan to Issue Principal and Interest

In the securities grey market, the rumors of the previous day and the inability to confirm the new loan continued to prevent morale from rising. It was widely rumored that a certain major player had been selling off hundreds of thousands in the past few days, all transactions by a certain politician. With such a large outflow of spot goods, reliance on small retail investors for absorption was deemed insufficient. With the Type A lottery approaching, the market was unable to make a strong recovery, and the prospects seemed difficult to be optimistic about. Most major players were waiting for an opportunity to take action and sell at high prices. If the market experienced several rounds of pressure, recovery would be doubly difficult.

The market activity yesterday was mostly dull, without breaking out of the sideways and weakening trend. Initially, number 20 helped major players cover short positions, and Tian Sheng also bought, making the market seem relatively strong. Later, however, the market suffered a setback due to heavy selling by Tongkang. The results at midday were mixed, and morale was weakening. The market was even weaker in the afternoon, with only Xinfeng Yong slightly covering short positions. On the selling side, numbers 7, 35, and Runli had a dominant position, and the market price became unstable and began to weaken. With the lunar year ending in a few days, most people were watching and waiting. The results yesterday showed a uniform decline of 4 to 5 jiao, with a total transaction volume of approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock transactions were not numerous. There was a transaction of 100 Zhabei Water and Electricity shares at a price of 6 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 fen. Huashang Shanghai Cement Company began paying dividends for the year 1937 starting yesterday (the 6th), including official bonuses and 8% annual interest, for a total annual interest rate of 16%.

London's listed market prices for Chinese foreign bonds on Monday, the 6th of this month, continued to rise slightly, increasing by 1/2 pound and 1 pound. Bonds that increased by 1/2 pound were British Indemnity Bonds, British-issued bonds, with a price of 48 pounds. Bonds that increased by 1 pound were German-issued Hukuang Railway Bonds, with a price of 21 pounds. Bonds that increased by 1/2 pound were the Longhai and Jinghu Railway Bonds, with the former priced at 13.5 pounds and the latter at 22 pounds. The rest were unchanged. Market activity included 2,000 pounds of German-issued British Indemnity Bonds, with a transaction price of 44 pounds, up 1/2 pound from the previous week's selling price. Actual British supply and demand was also very active. 4,500 pounds of British-issued Central Indemnity Bonds were sold at 49 pounds, 1 pound higher than the market price. Also, 1,000 pounds of German-issued bonds were sold at 45 pounds and 9 shillings, 1 pound and 5 shillings higher than the transaction price. Also, 2,000 pounds of Russian-issued bonds were sold at 43 pounds and 15 shillings, 1 pound and 5 shillings higher than the previous offering. 3,000 pounds of Sino-French American Dollar 5% Bonds (equivalent to 15,000 US dollars) were sold at 68 British pounds, a parallel market price of 63.875 US dollars. 5,000 pounds of German-issued Tianjin-Pukou Railway Reissued Bonds were sold at 16 pounds and 5 shillings, 5 shillings higher than the market price. 2,500 pounds of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds were sold at 18.5 pounds, a parallel market price. 3,000 pounds of non-German-issued Hukuang Railway Bonds were sold at 21.5 pounds, 1/2 pound lower than the market price. Also, there was a bid to buy 1,000 pounds at no more than 18 pounds, with the two sides fearing a close alignment. The general trend of the market was that upper-end bonds were slightly firmer, but lower-end railway bonds remained weak.

Principal and Interest of Anglo-German Continued Loan. According to a Reuters report from London on the 7th, the 41st lot of Anglo-German 4.5% Continued Loan of 1898 bonds drawn (drawn in London on January 3rd of this year) had a total principal to be repaid of 670,225 British pounds. The 82nd coupon had a total interest to be paid of 82,499 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence. All payments are scheduled to begin on March 1st at the HSBC Bank in London.

London's listed market prices for British-owned Jardine Matheson stocks on Monday, the 6th of this month, showed that HSBC shares were priced after deducting a dividend of 3 pounds. The new price for British-registered shares was 81 pounds and 15 shillings, and the new price for Hong Kong-registered shares was 83.5 pounds. The Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares rose by 9 pence to 17 shillings and 3 pence. The rest were unchanged.

A Table of Chinese Government Bonds compiled by the Shanghai Main Branch of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the third revised edition of 1939, has been published. It contains detailed information on over 130 types of central, provincial, municipal, and corporate bonds, and includes an article on China's new government bonds of the past year. The content is rich, and the figures are accurate, making it an important reference material. Those interested in domestic and foreign bonds can request it from the Trust Department Service Section of the bank.

### Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Factories Open Sales at High Prices; Another 3200 Bales Yesterday

Recently, the yarn market has not actively risen, but the trend is exceptionally stable. Once it fluctuates within the 400 yuan range, South China's demand for coarse and fine yarn continues unabated. At the same time, the financial community has a strong concept of stockpiling cotton textiles due to the abundance of liquid funds, and the market has been swept clean of all floating chips, making the market increasingly solid. As for the yarn factories, they are opening sales continuously at high prices, keeping pace with the times, and the forward sales for March and April of next year are also surging. The situation and quantities of each yarn opened by various factories yesterday are listed below.

### Large Firms Return to Purchase, Double Horse Yarn Reaches Peak Again: 406 Yuan

The yarn market initially rose, then weakened, with a tight trend. This was mainly because the actual demand was still not weak, but it was less than the previous day. Therefore, when the rise was excessive, some people who had made profits came to sell their holdings. For a time, the chips were slightly loose, and the market price immediately decreased. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn reappeared at 406 yuan, meeting the peak price of January 15th. Because of this, the short-term speculators took the opportunity to exit and prices fell back. At the same time, factories opened sales one after another due to high prices, without interruption throughout the day. It was found that the Xinsheng Yarn Factory, a newly established factory with approximately ten thousand plus yarn spindles, yesterday opened a large sale of one thousand bales at the Yarn Industry Association, with a price of 390 yuan, for a three-to-four-month term. Purchasers paid a deposit of 30 yuan per bale, and the initial receipt of 30,000 yuan in deposit money caused many parties to relax a little. However, according to the market, a Mr. Wu suddenly came to purchase several hundred bales of 20-count Double Horse spot yarn, and the market situation stabilized again. It was also said that this firm successively absorbed about 6,000 bales of cotton yarn, all with advances paid at the warehouse, resulting in considerable profits. It was found that their purchase price started at 318 yuan and continued to buy until now. According to this, the profits should be considerable.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning with very enthusiastic sentiment. Because the demand in the Nanhua area was frequent the previous day, people's confidence was strong. Spot traders were unanimously optimistic. Double Horse opened up by two yuan, reaching 406 yuan. A rough transaction was done at 407 yuan, and transactions among peers were extremely lively. Shortly after, it was heard that various factories had opened sales of about two to three thousand bales, causing the market sentiment to flatten out a bit. The selling price of Double Horse suddenly fell, with the lowest price reaching 403 yuan. Then, Mr. Wu entrusted others to suddenly buy, and the market price gradually recovered to close at 403.5 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume in the morning totaled 1,578 bales, compared to 245 bales the previous day, totaling 1,823 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day, Shepherd rose by 3.5 yuan, Heavenly Maiden rose by 0.5 yuan, Double Globe rose by 2.5 yuan, Special Golden City remained flat, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 3 to 4 yuan. The purchase volume of each group is listed on the left:

The supplementary record of the afternoon closing transactions the day before yesterday is as follows:

The Japanese yarn market remained dull as before, and the market conditions did not differ much from the previous day. Due to the previous squeeze in the transaction of raw hides for the next month, everyone was cautious and dared not try, and it was completely in a state of stagnation. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 329 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 323.5 yuan.

### Cotton Transactions Become More Sluggish

In the foreign cotton market, New York cotton prices remained sluggish as all firms adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the unresolved issue of Washington loan cotton sales. Yesterday, New York initially rose due to good overseas cotton prices, which caused firms to have a small amount of trading. Later, some southern firms covered their sales, and the New Orleans group sold, and cotton prices weakened at closing, falling by one or two points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by sixteen points. Yesterday, the exchange rate contracted, converting into legal tender, and the price of American and Brazilian cotton rose by 0.6 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 0.5 yuan, and Egyptian cotton fell by 0.4 yuan.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, it is feared that there will not be much transaction volume within the year. Yesterday, only Anda ordered 200 bales of Indian cotton Bellas, with a delivered factory price of 72 yuan. This cotton can be used for spinning 24-count yarn. On the Japanese factory side, only Gongda imported 300 bales of Brazilian cotton. The cotton prices yesterday are listed below:

The local cotton business is becoming increasingly depressed. All parties are preparing to end the year, so transactions are completely in a state of stagnation. Factory sentiment is particularly scattered, and there is nothing exciting in the market. The market situation is dull and stable. Once business starts, the market will continue to rise. Recently, the foreign exchange rate has tightened, and the combined price of foreign cotton has risen slightly. The source of goods from the Subei area is still slightly weak. The goods arriving at the wharf include 2,789 bales of Tong cotton, 150 pieces from Beisha, and 220 pieces from Baimao. The spot cotton transaction record is listed on the left:

### Piece Goods: Too Much Stock in Haiphong, Fewer Orders from Sichuan and Yunnan, Sluggish Transactions in Eastern Goods

National cloth, white goods, and fine cloth are slightly firm, while fine twill and coarse cloth are trending towards stability. The morning market price of Dayu fine cloth from Yong'an Factory was 12.65 yuan, and it rose by 0.05 yuan in the afternoon, opening at 12.7 yuan. The Guangdong and local wholesale firms purchased one hundred and several tens of pieces of Dayu and Fugui brands. There were only sporadic transactions in coarse cloth and coarse twill. The Fujian group purchased fifty to sixty pieces of colored cloth, woolen cloth, and serge. New orders from the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shantou groups have also become scarce. More than one hundred pieces of spring-colored cloth, fine cloth, and fine khaki were transacted, and the appetite for imports has weakened. It is said that due to too much stock in Haiphong and only one ship scheduled within the year, there is a deliberate wait-and-see attitude.

The spot market for fine cloth and fine twill in Eastern goods is gradually weakening, so yesterday's selling prices of various brands were unremarkable. Transactions with local customers were rare, but the opening prices of futures were gradually rising. This is because the sentiment of the industry is trending higher, and the appetite for imports in March and April is very strong. Although the price is 0.3 yuan higher per piece than the spot price, there is still no sign of hesitation. Dongmian and Ito firms continued to order about one thousand pieces of fine cloth such as Longtou and Laba yesterday. The selling price of Longtou for the far month was 12.1 to 12.15 yuan, and Laba was even sold at 11.85 to 11.9 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Filaments Surge, Overseas Sales Sluggish

The overseas silk market has continued to rise. Yesterday, the near-term in New York rose by three points, and the far-term rose by five points. Other Chinese and Japanese raw silk rose sharply by one point across the board. The morning market price of Yokohama spot was 940 yuan, and the afternoon price was 950 yuan. The far-term was 917 yuan, and the afternoon was 910 yuan. In the Lyon silk market, Chinese and Japanese raw silk rose by 1.50 to 2.50 francs each.

In the local silk market, due to the excessive surge, there were fewer transactions. On the foreign firm side, the French firm was quiet, and the American firm was quite interested in purchasing. The asking price of White Factory Grade 7-8 yesterday was 1,520 yuan. The foreign firm may absorb at a market price of 1,500 yuan flat. However, because the user RR has already opened a new offer of 1,500 yuan, the market price of Grade 7-8 must be between 1,520 and 1,540 yuan, considering the foreign firm's expenses. Therefore, overseas sales were temporarily tight yesterday. Filature silk is still popular for domestic sales. Overall, various raw silks seem to be advancing day by day in mid-February, with little possibility of falling.

Yesterday, one hundred and six pieces of Lake silk and forty-one tons of tea were shipped to Europe.

### Grains: Flour Market Brewing, Wheat Shows Stability with Underlying Looseness

The factory prices in the flour market continued to be unchanged. The customer sales market is still active in the southern group, followed by the northern group. Each factory is selling out the goods yet to be delivered, due to the current flour shortage. Although foreign wheat has arrived, it is still being unloaded, so the factories have no intention of devaluing sales. Only the buyers intend to bargain slightly. As a result, Grade 2 flour still maintained the original price of 4.8 yuan, with 15,000 to 16,000 bags jointly purchased by the North and South groups. There were also more than 8,000 bags in the local retail market. The market is still brewing.

The wheat market has entered a state of apparent stability with underlying looseness. It was found that there are not many sources of goods. The sellers are stubbornly insistent due to high costs, while the factories have nine ships of foreign wheat already ordered. Apart from the recent arrival of two ships, there is one more ship expected to arrive around the 20th of this month, and the remaining five ships are expected to be shipped to Shanghai successively in March. Therefore, the need for domestic wheat is even weaker. Fufeng Factory did not handle a single bag, and Fuxin Factory only responded to 200 bags of Jiangbei wheat, with the price still at 6.6 yuan. Although it has not declined, it is feared that the overall situation will not remain stable for long. The Shanghai wheat market will be almost entirely taken over by foreign wheat.

### Dumi and Kehsien Rice: Hoarders Continue to Purchase

Yesterday, the source of domestic rice saw only two to three thousand bags of Grade 2 from Hexia and Chelin buns, of which eight hundred bags came from Baimao and one thousand and one hundred bags came from Youpu. The opening of the morning market showed some sluggishness, and then, due to the scarcity of sources, people's confidence strengthened immediately, and the sales market in this street was active again. Hoarders purchased one after another, and sellers took the opportunity to call for higher prices. The situation at that time was quite chaotic, so as a result, although the market was tight overall, there were considerable differences in the prices of thick and thin japonica rice, with increases ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The supply and demand of Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian were similar. Although the sales channels for substandard rice seemed to be sluggish, the owners mostly insisted on pushing up prices due to the scarcity of goods, resulting in a fixed situation and a hidden increase of 0.1 yuan.

The retail stores and hoarders on this street for Kehsien rice continued to be strong. The total transaction volume throughout the day was still around 2,000 bags, and the market showed tightness again by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. When the price of Ben Jian soared in the afternoon market, the selling price of Kehsien rice was also called high by more than 0.1 yuan. However, a new batch of goods arrived in Shanghai by train, and many speculators and retail customers took advantage of the high prices to sell off, so the market price was not able to rise again. The asking price for Nanjing Special High Kehsien rice was still being pushed up, with high-quality goods opening at 11 yuan, and high-quality Wuxian rice not opening. The price of bulk goods varied from 10.05 yuan to 9.89 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Actual Sales of Yellow Soybeans Still Acceptable, Continued Exports of Raw Kernels and Soybeans

Recently, although there have been few transactions in the miscellaneous grains market, most of them are actual sales. Monthly demand is strong, so the market sentiment is particularly good. Yesterday, it was calculated that the local and Xiamen groups handled more than six hundred bags of Chongming Sand Yellow, and the market price rose again by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan, to 7.75 to 7.6 yuan. Also, 50 bags of Wujiang Picked Silkworms were transacted on this street, with a price of 6.12 yuan, and four bags of Chongming Sand Red, with a price of 6.75 yuan. Although the prices of the above two types have been slightly reduced, they are still in a more superior position compared to the quality of the goods.

Yesterday's soybean exports included 249 tons to Mumbai, 21 tons to Colombo, and 46 tons to Kedah (Singapore).

Also, yesterday 25 tons of raw kernels were shipped to Le Havre (France), and imports included 850 bags of raw kernels and 270 bags of peanuts from Weihaiwei.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Coarse and Car White, Spot Shortage

Yesterday, due to the impending closure of foreign sugar and the storage of unsold sugar, the spot supply was extremely short, resulting in an abnormal concentration of power. The association's posted price for 24 Dutch coarse white, goods at the local warehouse rose by another 0.05 yuan to 24.2 yuan. The price for re-exported goods was 16 yuan, and there were no sellers, and later a price of 16.2 yuan was called. Taikoo Car White B goods delivered at the West Warehouse rose by another 0.25 yuan, with a transaction at 23.7 yuan, and later a price of 23.9 yuan was called. The Chaozhou group posted a price of one hundred plus bags of cotton red, with the Jiate brand at 15.3 yuan, the next grade at 14.7 yuan, eighty bags of semi-Southern Blue at 13.4 yuan, and one hundred plus bags of Hainan Red at 12 yuan.

### Dried and Preserved Fruits: Quanzhou Round Longans Continue to Open a Batch

According to news from the production area of Quanzhou large-bubble dried longans, shipments to Shanghai are difficult to calculate, so the source is scarce. However, as the total closure date approaches, buyers are unwilling to increase prices any further. After discussions between the two sides, the transaction of eight hundred boxes will still be conducted according to the original price. The future market will wait for the spring offer to be opened.

### Metals: Thin Tinplate, Spot Supply to Be Cut Off

The sales markets for thin tinplate are mainly the cigarette, biscuit, and can factories on this street. Apart from Tianjin, which has some designated orders, other groups have very few transactions. The grades are divided into regular and substandard grades. Regular goods are divided into 175 sheets and 195 sheets. The price of 175 sheets is 120 yuan per box, and the price of 195 sheets is 130 yuan per box. Substandard goods are divided into with and without lining. Goods with lining are sold for 118 yuan per box, while goods without lining are sold for about 110 yuan, which are all 5 to 10 yuan higher than the previous market. However, the current spot supply in the market is very scarce, and buying sentiment is still strong. If there are no goods arriving this week, it is feared that the market may face the worry of being cut off within the year.

### Coal: Hongji White Coal, Another 2,000 Tons Arrive

During the winter, Fireplace white coal is generally a peak selling season. The population of the isolated island has increased sharply this year, and the demand is even greater, resulting in thriving customer sales and demand exceeding supply. Currently, Boadelta Trading Company has a large batch of Hongji white coal arriving, totaling 2,000 tons, being transported from the Yangjingbang by trucks to the warehouse. Yi Taixing and other managers are selling it. The colleagues are splitting the price, with the unified lump at 45 yuan per ton, the screened lump at 47 yuan, and the broken lump at 49 yuan. Same industry warehouse is sold by themselves, customer delivery, plus 4 yuan of handling. It is said that this batch of goods will not continue to arrive within the year.

### Woolen Cloth: Sales Are Weak, but Prices Remain Firm

Yesterday's woolen cloth market sales were weak, and spot wholesale transactions were also rare. There were not many transactions from customer groups, and small customer groups transporting goods to the Wenzhou port still had some orders, while the Western-style clothing group had scattered needs. Therefore, for the goods price, the market was mostly high. This is because the goods at the bottom are extremely scarce, domestic and foreign pricing are reported to rise, and people inside and outside the industry are enthusiastically absorbing and financing them, which has led to this situation.

### The Most Suitable Modern Building Material: Reinforced Concrete

— Yiqun

Reinforced concrete has been around for less than a century since its invention, and its widespread use has surpassed all other building materials. The meaning of "reinforced concrete" is quite obvious: adding steel bars to concrete is like adding sinews and veins. Concrete is made by mixing cement (commonly known as foreign ash, cement), sand, and gravel, adding water, and allowing it to solidify. However, lime can also be used instead of cement, and cement is divided into natural and artificial, as well as quick-setting and slow-setting. Sand is mostly a natural product, with uniform particles and sharp edges being the best. If necessary, stone chips can also be used instead. Crushed hard igneous rocks are the best choice for gravel. Other good quality limestone and sandstone can also be used. Naturally formed crushed gravel or pebbles are more commonly used. In areas where stone materials are very scarce, crushed bricks can also be used in small pieces, often for secondary projects. Other materials that use cinder instead of stone blocks are mostly used for foundation or paving projects. As for water, only clean water is needed, free of oil, acidity, and organic matter. Ordinary reinforced concrete is composed of cement, sand, and gravel, because the strength is often insufficient if other materials are used, which is not suitable.

Concrete not only uses a wide variety of raw materials, but also has different proportions of cement, sand, and gravel. Cement is generally used as the standard, and the amount of sand and gravel is several times that of cement, all measured by volume. For example, 1:2:4 concrete is composed of one part cement, two parts sand, and four parts gravel, and the rest can be deduced accordingly. The more cement content, the greater the strength. However, the mixing quality of sand and gravel also has a great relationship, and the amount of water added cannot be ignored. Therefore, the strength of concrete cannot be determined solely by its composition, and it can only be obtained by conducting on-site tests.

The steel bars used in reinforced concrete are generally rolled from steel billets of various grades, with medium-grade steel being the best. The surface of the steel bars can be divided into smooth and deformed types, and the cross-section can be square or round, with a total of eleven standard sizes. The finest is 1/4 round steel bar, and the thickest is square steel bar. Small-diameter thin steel bars are commonly used for steel bars and hoops. Deformed steel bars are made by twisting the steel bar around its longitudinal axis or casting bamboo-like protrusions on the surface to enhance the bonding force between the concrete and the steel bar, which is widely effective. When reinforced concrete is used for building floor slabs and paving surfaces, mesh steel plates and steel wire fabrics are also used instead of steel bars, with good results.

Reinforced concrete occupies an important position in construction because it has special advantages, which can be described as follows: Steel bars are materials that can withstand tensile force, while concrete has strong compressive resistance. Therefore, the combined use of the two can give full play to their respective strengths and synthesize extremely strong buildings. Not only is it difficult for brick and stone work to compare, even those that used to be constructed entirely of steel and iron, such as bridges and water towers, can also be built with reinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete is not only strong, but also durable. Once built, it almost does not need to be repaired. It is not as easy to rot as wood, nor does it need to be painted like steel and iron, and it is best used in humid areas and places with sudden climate changes. Wooden piles used in foundation projects are now often replaced with reinforced concrete piles, for this reason. The most important requirement for high-rise buildings is fire resistance. Reinforced concrete can not only build beams, columns, and walls, but also the internal floor slabs and handrails of houses can be made of reinforced concrete, so fire can be absolutely avoided and it is the safest material. Reinforced concrete can be formed into various shapes with formwork, from large structures such as hundred-foot-high dams to small structures such as pipes and ditches a few inches in diameter, almost all of which can be made of reinforced concrete. And it can be formed as a whole, making it completely free of gaps, so it is especially effective for water conservancy projects. The materials used for reinforced concrete, except for a small amount of steel bars, can all be obtained locally, requiring extremely low costs. Even if it needs to be transported to the work site from a slightly further location, it is also because each material is easy to transport, not as heavy as whole blocks of huge stones or large steel parts, so the required transportation costs are lower. Our country is extremely lacking in building materials. If wood and steel are used, they must all be supplied from foreign countries, and the amount of leakage is self-evident. If reinforced concrete is used, only steel bars need to be sourced from other countries. Other materials such as sand and gravel are everywhere, and the quality of domestic cement is not inferior to the standard regulations and can be adopted.

Reinforced concrete projects are not without considerable disadvantages, such as the need for specially made wooden formwork, so the materials and handling of the construction have extra huge expenses. Also, if the arrangement of steel bars and the mixing of materials all rely on proper handling, then the harm will be unimaginable. However, the templates can still be moved to other places after being removed. As for the technology required to handle reinforced concrete projects, it is far less complicated than brick and stonework and steelwork. Ordinary workers can do it with a little training.

In summary, it can be seen that reinforced concrete is the most excellent building material. In any aspect, it is mostly advantageous and has few disadvantages, and the cost is always lower than other materials, which is deeply in line with economic principles. Therefore, its widespread use will only increase.

The general implementation of reinforced concrete projects: the left is a square column, the right is a round column, the upper middle is paving a road, and the lower middle is building an arched culvert.

### The Danger of Low-Voltage Electricity

— Xiaonan

Be Careful When Bathing

Most workers believe that if a person does not have heart disease, they will not be fatally endangered if they touch 110 volts or 220 volts of high-voltage electricity. However, according to the report published by Mr. H. W. Arlin of the Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States, if the body of the person being electrocuted is wet, then even a low voltage of 12 volts can be fatal. If it exceeds 12 volts, needless to say. So it is extremely dangerous to reach out to turn on the light switch when we are bathing.

### Food Musings

— Xinqiu

The structure and function of the human body are very similar to a delicate and complex machine. Humans need to take in food, just like a machine needs to add coal. However, the food we ingest either increases heat, compensates for physical constitution, or is stored for future use, which is very complicated. The general characteristics of animals are often determined by heredity, but the food they ingest also has a significant relationship. If a person can usually only grow to a height of five feet and eight inches, no specially made food can ever make them exceed this number. Conversely, if the food is not nutritious enough, this person will not be able to reach a height of five feet and eight inches.

On average, each person consumes about fifty tons of food in their lifetime. And ingesting seventy pounds of food can grow one pound of meat on the body. We absorb about three thousand calories of heat per day. Healthy people convert 30 to 40% of these "thermal energy" into "kinetic energy." Humans use food not only to transform it into energy or store it, but also because of imperfect digestion and absorption, it is discarded from the body. Therefore, on the one hand, we attach importance to the nutritional value of food, but whether digestion and absorption can be fully carried out is also an important matter.

The necessary food raw materials for humans can usually be divided into four categories: protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals. Carbohydrates often become starch and sugar, and the main function is to produce energy. In metabolism, it and fat can interact to some extent. In healthy people, roughly 40 to 50% of the energy from the entire diet comes from carbohydrates, and 30 to 35% comes from fat. Fat often forms a protective layer around the nerves. It is the cushion of the nerves. Lack of fat in the human body will not only make it easy to become weak, but also cannot obtain sufficient fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, etc., which has extremely great danger in physiology. Protein is the element that forms the basic protoplasm of cell life. Its molecules are very complex, but only a few chemical elements are included in its composition. Most proteins contain about 51 to 55% carbon, 7% hydrogen, 20 to 23% oxygen, 1.53 to 2% sulfur, and some even contain small amounts of phosphorus or iron. Plants can form amino acids to form life-sustaining proteins, so most of the protein needed by animals is taken from plants. When pure carbohydrates and proteins are oxidized in the body, roughly each gram can generate four calories of heat, and animal or vegetable fats can generate nine calories. Water only makes up most of the weight of food, and it cannot generate any energy. The chemical composition of various human foods can represent a cross-section of various substances on earth. Not only do various elements exist in food, but they must also form a way that is easy for the human body to absorb. If it is said that the body lacks iron, then you can never directly eat iron ore to compensate for this defect, because these elements must wait until after special composition before the body can absorb and utilize them.

It has now been proven that the condition for individual health must have at least 50% of minerals. According to this standard, the average adult must obtain 0.68 grams of calcium per day. Calcium is very important for the preservation of teeth and bones, and phosphorus is also very important. Iron is the essence of blood, and the index of anemia is based on the content of hemoglobin. The human body has about 3% of blood cells that are continuously destroyed. If there is no iron compensation, then the number of blood cells will become abnormal and anemia will occur. It can be seen from this that minerals in food are also a major element in physiology.

Usually, the degree of digestion of food, mixed food is often higher than that of pure food. The purpose of cooking food is to shorten the digestion time and make it easy to absorb. The time to pass through the entire digestive tract is in the range of twelve to forty-seven hours, and excessive or insufficient is an abnormal phenomenon. When cooking vegetables, it is best to pay attention to the amount of water to avoid the loss of minerals and vitamin C.

Life is maintained by food, and health is enhanced by various nutrients. The close relationship between food and the body is really worth paying attention to.

### Killing Insects with Death Rays

— By 吾昔

Works like a Flashlight

A few years ago, there were rumors that some country had invented a death ray that could wipe out all living beings in the area it shone upon. This was truly absurd and not worth a laugh. Now, the most powerful death rays invented by scientists can only kill small animals.

Leray Corporation of America has recently manufactured a death ray lamp called the infrared lamp, which can kill ticks, fleas, and other cold-blooded small animals that parasitize dogs, cats, and birds. It can also kill pests that harm plant seeds, cloth, wood, and other materials. It is said that the rays emitted by this lamp can also kill bacteria, so it can be used to remove plant pathogens.

Currently, the application of this death ray mainly focuses on removing pests from livestock. The illustration in this article was taken at Abercrombie & Fitch, a sporting goods company in New York City, USA. The company uses this lamp to demonstrate the irradiation of customers' dogs every day, and the results of killing insects are quite good.

Of course, irradiating a dog once will not remove all the pests on its body. However, this is not because the power of the death ray is insufficient to kill them immediately, but because these small animals often leave the dog's body at short intervals; especially when the dog is full and drowsy, they leave the "group" more frequently. Therefore, there are many pests in the dog kennel; if you want to clean the dog kennel, you can use the dog as bait to lure and kill them.

The method of using this death ray lamp is as easy as using a flashlight. Just hold it close to the dog's body and use the other hand to turn the dog's hair over so that the ray hits the dog's skin. However, in order to calm the dog, the lamp must be pre-irradiated several times, each time for a short period, until it is no longer frightened by the lamp. Irradiating each part of the dog's body for a fraction of a second to four or five seconds can kill all the pests in that part.

### Long-Distance Wireless Typewriter

— (葉人)

This wireless typewriter was originally invented in Germany, and now it has been adopted by both Britain and the United States. It can transmit text to distant places and print it out. Inside the transmitter, there is a rotating cylinder with all the letters on a standard typewriter keyboard. When the sending operator types a letter, the cylinder rotates, converting the symbol into a heavy impulse and transmitting it. On the receiving end, the procedure is exactly the opposite, and the received message is printed letter by letter on a strip of paper. The following picture is a photograph of several strips of printed paper received.

### World Science News

Coal-Made Stockings

Readers have probably seen this argument in the newspapers. Just by having all the women in the United States not wear Japanese silk stockings, we can give "the friendly nation's economy a blow. It can be seen that a mere stocking is also worthy of our attention.

Recently, a certain chemist invented a method to extract a synthetic fiber from extremely common raw materials such as coal, air, and water. In addition to being used for making stockings, it can also be used to make products, brush bristles, and plastics.

This fiber is called "Nylon" and can be drawn into fine and glossy silk. It is as strong as steel and has more elasticity than natural fibers. It is said that this is the first time in human history that an organic woven fiber has been made from minerals.

Currently, this new synthetic material has been used to make bristles for toothbrushes, but its most promising use is in making extremely thin, strong, very elastic, and not easily loose socks. Other possible uses include making sewing thread, woven fabrics, tennis racket strings, fishing lines, as well as transparent wrapping paper and clothing.

The End of the Electric Spark Transmitter

Due to international agreement, all communications from high-power electric spark transmitters will be prohibited from 1940 onwards. Electric spark transmitting stations with a power of 300 watts or more will cease operations from January 1 of that year. The United States has had this firm position since 1927 because such high-power electric spark transmitting stations are sufficient to disrupt international broadcasting. However, despite the opposition of the United States, the telegraphic transmission of low-power transmitters may still be maintained, but only limited to three frequencies, namely 375 kHz for direction finders, 425 kHz for commercial communications, and 500 kHz for distress calls (SOS) in the event of an accident.

Extracting Livestock Feed from the Air

德化舉家 recently gave a presentation at a gathering in貝勞愛斯, describing various novel inventions. Among the most notable were reports on obtaining livestock feed from the air and using noise to assist in the transformation of metals. It is claimed that livestock feed that can greatly increase the amount of butterfat in milk can now be manufactured by extracting nitrides and carbides from the air. Furthermore, certain noises can be used to promote chemical changes in metals, such as a special hard aluminum that could not be manufactured in the past but can now be made. There is also a new substitute for rubber called "Buna" that can maintain its elasticity down to -60 to -70 degrees Celsius, whereas ordinary rubber would already be brittle as glass at this temperature.

Discovery of Three New Vitamins

In medicine, we already know the importance of vitamins to the human body, but how many types there are, we cannot make a definitive statement at this time because the discovery of new vitamins is progressing with each passing day. Recently, three scientists at the 理化硏究所 in Tokyo, Japan, discovered two new vitamins, naming them vitamin L1 and L2. Their report was published in the Japanese magazine "Science." It is claimed that both of these vitamins are essential for mother rats to produce milk to feed their young. Yeast in baking powder is the source of vitamin L2, while vitamin L1 is obtained from beef liver. Another new vitamin, D3, was discovered and extracted by Professor Adolf Windaus and his colleagues at the University of Göttingen in Germany. Its function is to prevent rickets in children, and its effectiveness is greater than vitamin D2. Fish oil contains this substance.

### Introducing "Natural Teaching Materials"

— 士心

"Natural Teaching Materials" edited by Mr. Chen Heqin. There are ten types in total. Those that have been published include "Daily Water," "Study of Light," "Strange Magnets," "Mother of Machines," "Changes in Weather," "How to Learn Photography," "Road and Bridge Construction," "How to Prevent Infectious Diseases." Those that are already in print include "Air Pressure," "Our Eyes," "Food and Nutrition," "Airplanes," "Who Makes Food," "Our Clothes," "Our Homes," "Ships and Submarines," and "How Fire Starts." All are simple booklets that use simple language to describe scientific facts. High school and junior high school students are easily interested in this. The editor's purpose is to use ordinary, common things, that is, all natural phenomena, to add scientific explanations so that readers can obtain common scientific knowledge. In each booklet, there is an "Introduction" to arouse students' motivation to pursue and explore interest in science, an "Observation Experiment" to allow students to come into contact with common scientific phenomena, and explain the methods, "Reference Materials" to make it easier for readers to find reasons and supplement their lack of knowledge. There is also a "Test Question" to explore the knowledge and experience students have gained. There is also a "Reference Book" to allow students to browse more and have a more thorough understanding of what they have learned. Their knowledge will therefore be enriched. Mr. Heqin has been engaged in education for more than 20 years. He specializes in primary and secondary school education. His knowledge and experience are rich enough to be called a giant in this field. Now that he is the editor of this book, and there are experts in various fields to assist him, its content should be exquisite and its format perfect. It is most suitable for high school and junior high school students. These small booklets, printing and binding, are all refreshing to the eye. Young students who want to obtain ordinary scientific knowledge should not be without a copy in hand.

### New Invention of Handheld Television

— (British Daily Telegraph, 采)

The art of television is truly one of the most recent and novel inventions, with a complex structure that is not easy to use at first. But now there is the invention of a handheld television. When in use, there is no need for a darkroom. In terms of appearance, the device is similar to a telephone handset, and it weighs less than two pounds. The user holds the machine close to the side of the head, with one end being an earpiece that covers the ear for listening to sound, and the other end being an eyepiece through which a small television screen can be seen. The transmitted image is projected onto it, and the size of the picture is only one inch square. Thus, when we talk to friends over long distances, we can not only hear but also see them.

I wasn't an optimist before, I was even a pessimist. But since the "August 13th Incident," I have gradually changed, and now I have become a complete optimist.

Some people will definitely say that my life was too difficult before, so I was pessimistic. Now, if I am not a "nouveau riche," maybe I made a fortune from the "national crisis," so I am getting what I want and I am optimistic about everything. This is indeed very reasonable, because there are many people who are complacent there for this reason.

However, the change in my views, although also due to the change in my environment, the two ways of changing are exactly the opposite of what most people think. My life was not very luxurious before, but it was still quite comfortable. Now, although I am not reduced to sleeping on the streets or relying on refugee shelters, I have indeed reached the point of being stretched and short-handed. However, I was pessimistic before, and now I am optimistic.

Before, I always felt that I was drifting around, with nothing to rely on. I would shed tears when I saw flowers, sigh at the moon, and groan without any illness all day long, as long as I had time. I really thought that life was empty, society was chaotic, the country was hopeless, and the world was forever chaotic. I firmly believed that I was wasting my life. I resented life. Now, I am very different. Since being baptized by artillery fire and being impoverished, I have been busy all day long, and I have realized the true meaning of life from my busyness. I believe even more that my life is not in vain. I can do some things, even the most trivial things, that will leave some achievements in human history. Society will always be stable one day, and the country and the world have even more reasons to be optimistic!

In nearly twenty months of the War of Resistance, if one is not insane or has ulterior motives, which descendant of the Yellow Emperor does not have a firm concept of victory in his heart! Therefore, some setbacks and some divisions are just the necessary processes before victory. Recently, "Mr. Party Discipline's" proposal for peace negotiations does not need to be pessimistic, because in this way, the central government can be clarified, and some dross can be eliminated so that it will not destroy the overall situation from within. Therefore, regarding the War of Resistance, as long as we persevere to the end, the final victory is absolutely no problem, so why shouldn't we be optimistic!

As for the world, it is naturally a time when the forces of darkness are rising, hindering the progress of mankind. But this is only temporary, just like the last rays of the setting sun, and there is no need to worry about it. In the five thousand years of human history, we can see many dark periods, but the world today has indeed progressed. This is precisely the spiral progress, although there are places that go backwards, but generally speaking, it is still forward. Darkness is only the prelude and harbinger of light. And on average, although "the general trend of the world, one unification, one chaos," after all, there is more governance than chaos. The difficulties that the world is currently encountering will soon pass. There is really no need to worry about anything!

"Born in adversity, die in ease," this sentence is the best annotation of my personal transformation from pessimism to optimism. "Adversity builds a nation," "A country without external enemies will always perish," this sentence is the best explanation of why the country and the world are worthy of optimism. I am optimistic, let us all be optimistic.

However, we should pay attention that the so-called optimist is not to take pleasure in oneself and stand by and "watch." Rather, it requires us to maintain a happy and encouraging heart, and use a lively and self-strengthening force to strive forward in personal, national, and all things!

### In the Twilight

— 洪熖

The fields were quiet, and the north wind was blowing gently. The setting sun crawled to the edge of life, its face flushed, glaring at the earth.

A Fu, Xiao Lu, and Lao Liu, three children walked slowly to the town, humming in unison the song newly made by Lao Liu—a young and strong northeastern man:

When we mention the events of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China,

It will make even iron men shed tears;

Our fields are trampled by the enemy,

Thirty million compatriots become cattle and horses!

We are forbidden to speak our own language,

We are driven out of our own homes.

We can no longer hear the sobbing cold tide of the Heilongjiang River,

We can no longer see the shining snow on Changbai Mountain!

But, we don't need to complain,

We will never let the enemy's flag fly for long,

We will repay eye for eye and tooth for tooth!

Compatriots, unite,

Use bloody battles as our answer!

Use bloody battles as our answer, answer!

Humming repeatedly, they were only three li away from Xicun!

"Lao Liu! What do you say, what should we do if we encounter a search? What about those few guns?" A Fu suddenly asked the brave villager softly, stroking the slightly raised thing on his left chest.

"Fool, what are you afraid of! If they don't give us trouble, then that's it, let them live a few more hours! Otherwise, huh! If they're impatient to live, we'll send them back!" Lao Liu answered straightforwardly.

"However, this may be a bit inconvenient for our mission:" Xiao Lu said coldly.

No one else continued to speak, and the air in the four gardens also became quiet.

Suddenly, A Fu grabbed Lao Liu's sleeve, stopped on the road, and gently nudged forward with his mouth: "Hmph! Be careful! Here they come!"

About ten zhang ahead on the road, two figures were holding two Type 38 rifles, walking this way with a carefree and laughing manner.

"Don't mind them, let's keep walking forward carefully! The sun is going down soon!" Lao Liu said nonchalantly.

Closer, the two sides were only a zhang apart!

The two figures were swaggering and squirming as if they were drunk. When they saw the three heroic partners on this side, they hurriedly picked up the Type 38 rifles with bayonets attached, muttering in their mouths:

"Stand still! Stand still! What coming West! Guerrilla team."

"Damn it, Grandpa has to do it himself!" Lao Liu cursed secretly, and immediately winked at Xiao Lu and A Fu.

The two immediately took a step forward, stood in the middle of the road, and raised their hands. Lao Liu also followed suit, but stood a little further behind.

"Hahaha...!" The other side nodded triumphantly, both holding their rifles in one hand and searching Xiao Lu and A Fu's bodies with the other.

Unexpectedly, Lao Liu snatched the shiny bayonet, and then nimbly stabbed the head of the one searching Xiao Lu with a knife. He fell!

The other one was about to turn around and run, but A Fu had already grabbed him. He wanted to shout, but Xiao Lu had already covered his mouth with one hand! His face turned red, struggling desperately!

Lao Liu made a hole in the top of his head like the previous one, cursing hatefully in his mouth:

"You little bastard, delaying Grandpa's time! Today Grandpa has to kill a few more of you to feel good! Hmph! You're happy!"

The setting sun, with a dazzling red face, was almost at the horizon, but before setting, it still reflected a ray of twilight.

### Each Displaying Their Abilities

— 麗華

### Profile of Dictators (Part II)

— Translated by 哲非

Mussolini

Mussolini trained the people of Italy as he willed, and the King of Italy looked like a lackey in front of him, but Mussolini could not (perhaps did not want to) be led by the nose by Donna Rachele, Mussolini's wife.

Mussolini's father used to open a wine shop next to his blacksmith shop, and Donna Rachele used to wipe the glass there. Her habits have not changed to this day. "Donna" is a title of honor that only ladies of the A-level white-collar class can use.

Mussolini moved his wife to the vast Torlonia Villa, located in the suburbs of Rome. But she was not happy, so she chose a simple house at the entrance as her residence. She took care of her "tiger" here, who returned to his lair at night after robbing and plundering outside during the day.

Only one Roman journalist was fortunate enough to have an interview with Donna Rachele. She said that her husband could roam around like a tiger during the day, but he had to return home like a tame cat before half past eight. It is said that Mussolini once said to this interviewer, "If Donna Rachele wants it that way, I will definitely return home like a tame cat."

Mussolini proposed to Rachele at the age of twenty-five with a violin. The Roman newspapers once fully discussed his violin skills. Now all of Italy believes that he is a great violinist. But Donna Rachele has established the law that this "great man" must leave his sword, violin, and speeches in the office.

Donna Rachele did not want to interfere in her husband's politics. But within the family she managed, she would not allow any competitors. After feeding the chicks in the morning, she would take a basket and walk from the small street to the market, and people would not be too surprised at her. The merchants in the market all knew that she was a shrewd shopper.

Donna Rachele never appeared with her husband in public places. She did not find it surprising that her old friends came to see her. She visited them without formally notifying them in advance.

Except in cases of serious matters, Mussolini was always home for dinner at half past eight at night, and spent the evening at home. Even his enemies admit that his wife never did any cronyism for her friends. Everyone knew that she helped the poor "comrades" in need, but she never asked her husband to help them. She secretly helped them with her own resources.

### Hesitation

— 抱一

A sheep separated from the flock, a rudderless boat, drifting aimlessly in the boundless life, unable to grasp anything real. Sorrow, anger, and hesitation surrounded me, and what I heard and saw were all miserable scenes!

I don't want to live like this anymore. Living like this, I deeply believe that my life will be senselessly ruined. I want to drive away the enemies surrounding me. I want to break through all the dark environments. I want to seek a straight path from the midst of hesitation and reach an ideal and happy place.

But, the ideal's strong enemy, it doesn't let me go at all, it is more ferocious and arrogant towards me, using more cruel means to intensify its oppression on me. The whip of life lashes me ruthlessly, leaving no room and giving me no chance to breathe. The treacherous nature of human relationships everywhere uses vicious methods to control me. My fragile soul cannot withstand such blows and oppression, and I cannot help but feel pain and shed tears!

However, relying solely on tears still cannot escape the realm of hesitation. This is tantamount to surrendering to the dark environment. This is clearly the victory of the environment, and the pain of oneself is not relieved in the slightest. This, apart from showing utter cowardice, has no other positive actions to replace the struggle.

I know that pain is spiral, and in the process of life, it is endless. Those who do not understand the view of life divide pain and happiness into two parts. In fact, pain and happiness are eternally linked together; without pain, one would not know happiness; knowing pain, then one can appreciate happiness.

I want to rouse myself from the abyss of pain: I want to use the greatest determination to overcome the dark environment, not be pessimistic, not hesitate, and wholeheartedly walk towards the ideal happy place. The mistakes of previous life concepts and the loss of the courage to fight must be greatly changed from today onwards. That is to use strong perseverance and decisive determination to replace pessimism and hesitation to stabilize the future prospects.

### In the Flames of War

— 周燕

"You are going to the front. This time, it is to strive for the victory of the country, and I don't hope that you can come back. But before you leave, we should all arrange things properly. If the war approaches here, what should our family do?"

Commander Ye frowned and scratched his knuckles loudly again.

"I don't see any railways or highways here, and it's not a military strategic location. Even if the war approaches, it doesn't mean it will reach here. At most, it will be surrounded. That bomb just now was actually because everyone was crowding and clamoring, so it was mistaken for our troops gathering here, and it was thrown down. So, really, there's nothing to worry about. If the situation really becomes critical in the future, then try to hire a boat and go to Taihu Lake to take refuge."

"It would be best to tell Fang Jun not to go back to the army," Mrs. Ye said with a worried and self-righteous tone: "There must be more guns and bombs on the front line, how can people feel at ease!"

"Bah! You really have a woman's perspective. Fang Jun is no longer a member of our family, but a member of the country. How can you let him not go back as you please?" Old Mr. Ye kept shaking his head and said.

"If I am ordered to fight as a guerrilla, then I may come back here again." Commander Ye said with an uncertain tone, and a desire to defend his hometown clearly flashed in his eyes. "But the situation here is very bad, it is really not suitable for officials to use as a guerrilla base. To the east is the Sujia Road, and to the north, 北　平 has also blocked it off. Once these transportation lines are occupied by the enemy, it will be very difficult for the guerrillas to operate and obtain supplies."

Old Mr. Ye listened blankly, and he didn't even notice that the paper coal in his hand was about to burn to his fingertips.

"According to what you said, then this place is really not good, we should evacuate as soon as possible."

"That's right, evacuate as soon as possible." Mrs. Ye agreed very much and echoed.

Commander Ye hesitated.

"Evacuate, this is not something we soldiers should say. And now it is a full-scale war of resistance, and no place in the country can be exempt from the war. It is the same no matter where you evacuate. My opinion is that everyone should not move for the time being. Look at the future situation, either stay here, or retreat with our troops." (7)

### Demon Song

— 金丁

Tao Xingzhi's Recent Work Mr. Tao Xingzhi, a life educationist, has always advocated pragmatism. Eight years ago, when he was in charge of Nanjing Xiaozhuang Normal School, he cooked rice, picked manure, and did everything himself with the students. He often said: "The experience gained in life is true education, living education." Therefore, his educational goal is "life education," which is "the unification of teaching and learning."

When the guns of the "August 13th" national War of Resistance sounded, Mr. Tao stood on the front line of the times, doing the life of a cultural warrior. Recently, he wrote a vernacular poem and sent it to "Mother of the Guerrilla Team" Zhao Lao Tai Tai, the words are clear and smooth, and it can be said that both women and children can understand it. Now, I will copy it below for wide dissemination:

"A monster comes out of the East Sea, an old lady comes out of China!

The old lady catches the monster, the monster is scared!

The old lady has a famous saying, saving the country is paramount!

Don't die in bed, die in battle is fun!"

### The Pu Shan Villa for Burying Corpses

— New Dream

After the War, the Lumberyard Moved to Gordon Road and Continues to Work Hard: 60,000 to 70,000 Corpses and Coffins Have Been Buried From August 13th to the Present

Pu Shan Villa is a charitable organization dedicated to burying the dead. It has a long history in Shanghai. Recently, due to a shortage of funds, it held a fundraising theatrical performance at the Golden Theatre. All the participants were famous figures, pavilions, socialites, and the Le Shan She opera troupe.

We know that the main charitable work of Pu Shan Villa before the war was to provide coffins and burial services. With the outbreak of the "August 13th" incident, due to the crowding of refugees and the frequent tragic events, the work of providing coffins and burial services became particularly urgent. During the war, we saw burial vehicles with blue crosses on the streets, which belonged to Pu Shan Villa.

After the war moved away from Shanghai, the population in the concessions was so large that the work of Pu Shan Villa was as busy as during the war, burying corpses every day. It is said that from "August 13th" to the present, Pu Shan Villa has buried 60,000 to 70,000 corpses and coffins. This number is enough to shock you, isn't it?

Poor people who die without being claimed are taken away by Pu Shan Villa, placed in a thin wooden coffin, and buried in the outskirts. Most of these coffins are donated by philanthropists. It is said that a donation of ten yuan can provide a coffin from Pu Shan Villa, and many grandmothers and wives in mansions believe that providing coffins is a great act of charity and often donate. However, after "August 13th," too many refugees and civilians died, resulting in an increase in the expenses required by Pu Shan Villa, which often felt insufficient.

What particularly shocked us was the prevalence of scarlet fever in Shanghai during the spring and winter of last year, which caused unprecedented misfortune for children, and countless numbers died. Poor families wrapped their dead children tightly in cotton quilts or straw mats and left them by the roadside or at the entrances of alleys, and some used small coffins. Pu Shan Villa collected and buried these dead children every day.

At that time, the Pu Shan Villa's blue cross corpse collection trucks patrolled the streets, and small straw bundles and small coffins piled up like a mountain on the truck. The heads and small hands of the dead children were exposed, causing a sense of inexplicable sadness to those who witnessed it. Recently, smallpox has been very prevalent again, and straw bundles and small coffins abandoned on the streets and alleys can be seen everywhere. Although not as many as last year, Pu Shan Villa's corpse collection trucks still collect half a truckload of children's corpses every day.

These corpses are taken to the outskirts of Shanghai for burial, mostly in the Hongqiao area. The concessions have become "isolated islands," and nothing is free. Problems arise when people die at home, and coffins cannot be easily carried out of the concessions. Wealthy families can pay to keep them in funeral homes or coffin storage places, but poor people cannot afford to spend more money for the dead. However, Pu Shan Villa can solve this problem for you, transporting the coffin outside the concessions for burial. Each coffin has a mark at the burial site so that it can be dug up according to the mark if you want to transport it back to your hometown for burial after the war is over.

The lumberyard of Pu Shan Villa was originally in Nanshi, and the office was in Ren Liu Tang on Sixth Road. After the war, the lumberyard moved to the concessions, near Gordon Road and Connaught Road. It is surrounded by fences, and inside is a large open space filled with painted and unpainted wooden coffins. Many carpenters are busy working, nailing the coffins together and painting them, with a blue cross printed in black ink. At the same time, every day, seven or eight burial workers wearing blue cross vests sit on trucks to collect and bury corpses. The trucks leave in the morning and return at night. We should express our sincere respect and offer assistance to these burial workers who work for charitable causes and urban sanitation.

### Year-End and New Year

— Written by Xue Sheng

### The Eve of the Closing Period

— New Bright

Customs Are Hard to Change, Year After Year: Shanghai's Financial Market Remains Stable

I really don't know why, once Chinese people get into a certain habit, it's not easy to get rid of it. For example, the abolition of the lunar calendar. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the government has announced that we should use the Gregorian calendar, but until now, most families, especially those in business and farmers in rural areas, are still using the lunar calendar, and they seem to be even more inseparable from it, refusing to abandon or forget it at all. Therefore, we can very strangely say: "Every Chinese person will celebrate at least two year-ends and two New Years."

Not long ago, we had already celebrated a year-end and a New Year—the Gregorian New Year. The enthusiastic and crazy celebrations at that time are still deeply imprinted in our minds. And in the blink of an eye, another year-end, along with another New Year—the lunar New Year—is about to come before us in the shortest period.

The Shanghai Money Industry Association has already decided that February 18th of the Gregorian calendar—December 30th of the lunar calendar (New Year's Eve)—will be the closing period for the 27th year of the Republic of China. Also, the four days of the 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd—the first, second, third, and fourth days of the lunar New Year—will be the settlement period, and all banks will be closed during this period to handle the closing.

Of course, because Chinese people especially love the lunar calendar, the situation of the past Gregorian New Year will ultimately be inferior to the upcoming lunar New Year. Except for a very small number of modern families, most Shanghai people like to celebrate the lunar New Year. Their busy and tense preparations for the New Year are really shocking to us. Regarding the Gregorian year-end and New Year, people can generally say: "We are old-fashioned; we only celebrate the lunar New Year," to搪塞 (搪塞 tángsè: to evade; to stall; to prevaricate; to make excuses), but for this lunar year-end and New Year, they have no choice but to prepare for it. Even people who struggle to make a living in difficult circumstances all year round plan to make the most of this lunar closing period.

These days, which are precisely the "closing period," people's lives are many times more tense than usual—wealthy families, of course, need not be said, are busy sending New Year's gifts and preparing New Year's goods such as New Year cakes, fruit plates, and lucky envelopes, tailoring new clothes and shoes for the New Year…etc., they are really having a great time. Even ordinary middle and lower-class people are tidying up old things, cleaning rooms, and cooking some New Year's dishes… preparing to have a few days of fun after the closing period.

Among them, the busiest are still those merchants and shops. All industries are handling things according to the decisions of the Money Industry Association, preparing everything in this closing period that has not yet arrived but is about to arrive; they are distributing lists of accounts in this city as soon as possible, and setting deadlines for repayment; they are also separately dispatching commissioners to other cities to collect accounts, and the responsible managers must allocate "头寸 (tóucùn: short-term capital)" in order to safely get through this closing period. There are also "谢年 (xiè nián: thanking the gods for the year's blessings)" and "盤貨 (pánhuò: stocktaking)…" In short, everyone is busy during this period, and there is no free time at all.

According to people in the business field, after the war in Shanghai, due to the increase in population and the destruction of factories in various rural areas, various shops and factories have successively crowded into the concessions, causing the abnormal development of Shanghai. Regarding Shanghai's financial market, it is still as stable as usual, and there is no sign of chaos. Therefore, everyone can expect that no unfortunate events will occur during this year's closing period.

Episode 3: Welcoming the Remains and Commemorating the Old Righteous Man; Opening Literacy Classes for Little Teachers

He Liyu was very quick-witted and smiled, saying, "Oh! I know! I know you and Mr. Lin are getting married soon. When exactly is it? Of course, we have to come to the wedding banquet!" Jin Danyu said, "It's next month. That's why I hope you'll come earlier." He Shuangyu said, "Of course! We will definitely come. We won't be going back to Guangdong for the time being. Even our father will be delayed for several months and come to Shanghai. Once you set the date, just send us a message, and we'll come right away. You can't not tell us!" Jin Danyu said, "If I wasn't going to tell you, I wouldn't be saying it now. At that time, I'll have a month's leave, and I'll go out to play with you all." He Liyu chuckled and laughed, saying, "Will you still be going out to play with us then? You'll have someone else to go out to play with." She pointed at Lin Jiancheng and laughed. She then asked, "Where are you getting married? What kind of ceremony will there be?" Danyu said, "There's no ceremony. We'll just register at the Municipal Government Marriage Bureau. But we're thinking of hosting a dinner in the evening, but we haven't decided on a place. There are many friends…" She pointed at Lin Jiancheng and said, "They're all his friends! They want us to have a dance party, but we haven't agreed. It's too wasteful! Although we've both studied abroad, we can't learn from the foreigners. The extravagance and vanity of foreigners are truly the crisis of capitalist countries!" Lin Jiancheng said, "Speaking of the extravagance of foreigners, I remember an incident. It was probably in 1938! China was at war at that time, and I was only fifteen years old. In order to know the current affairs, I was reading the newspaper every day. On that New Year's Eve, a news report from New York said that the average price of a main course that night was thirty US dollars per person. At that time, the exchange rate between China and the United States was one US dollar for six Chinese legal tender. When I calculated it, a main course costing thirty US dollars per person was equivalent to one hundred and eighty Chinese legal tender per person. Just imagine: one hundred and eighty yuan just to eat one main course, which scared my childish heart at the time. Because at that time, there were many refugees in China who had nothing to eat. Many relief organizations were raising funds there, and just one dime a day was enough to live on. Then one hundred and eighty yuan for one main course could feed one thousand eight hundred people for a day. The calculation wasn't wrong. Later, after I went abroad, although I never ate a main course costing thirty US dollars, I think it was just ordinary. Would it stay on my palate forever after eating it? Thinking about our past hardships, we can't bear to be extravagant now." (34)

### Film News from Hong Kong

— Nie Ge, reporting from Hong Kong

Li Li from Peiping, starring in "A Great Beauty" produced by Lianyi Film Company, has been completed. Li received a reward of (Hong Kong dollars) 2,500 yuan. The film is jointly performed by Shanghai stars Zhang Yi, Yao Ping, Jiang Junchao, Bai Lu, and Hong Kong stars. In addition to the Mandarin copy, a Cantonese copy is also produced. The film is scheduled to be released during the Lunar New Year. The copy released in Hong Kong is in Mandarin, and the Cantonese copy is sold to various ports in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. It was previously reported that members of the China Art Troupe participated in the film, which is incorrect. Li was staying at the Six Nations Hotel when she came to Hong Kong and has recently moved to the New Asia Hotel in Kowloon, across the sea from Hong Kong. It is rumored that she is going to Shanghai to resume her career as a dancer, but it remains to be verified.

National Defense Films Emerge One After Another

The state-run film production organization, the China Film Studio under the Third Hall of the Military Commission, has been working harder to produce national defense films since it moved from Hankou to Chongqing. Since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the studio has produced six newsreels on the military situation on the front line, entitled "Special Edition of the Anti-Japanese War." The first five episodes have been shown in Hong Kong, and the sixth episode will also be released soon. The feature films with national defense content that have been shown in Hong Kong include "Defend Our Land" (directed by Shi Dongshan, starring Shu Xiuwen and Wei Heling), "Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls" (written and directed by Yuan Congmei, starring Gao Zhanfei, Li Lili, and He Feiguang), and "Eight Hundred Heroes" (written by Yang Hansheng, directed by Ying Yunwei, starring Yuan Muzhi, Chen Boer, Chen Shufan, and Hong Hong). According to Luo Jingyu, the technical section chief of the studio, the new films currently being produced or planned by the studio include "The Last Drop of Blood" (written and directed by Hong Shen, starring Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and Tian Fang, with He Feiguang and Chen Tianguo), "China's Roar" (written and directed by Yuan Muzhi), "China's Childhood" (written by Yang Hansheng, directed by Shi Dongshan), "The Women's Army" (written by Sun Shiyi, directed by Yuan Congmei), "Anti-Japanese March" (written by Tang Yu, jointly directed by Ying Yunwei and others), "Long Live China" (adapted by Wang Wei, directed by Shi Dongshan), and "Creation" (written and directed by Yuan Congmei). In addition, the studio has decided to establish a branch in Hong Kong. The first film is "South China Sea Storms," written and directed by Cai Chusheng, starring Li Lili, Zhang Yi, Jiang Junchao, etc. Li Lili has arrived in Hong Kong from Yuyu via Haiphong, and the start of filming is near. Cai Chusheng specially went to Hong Kong's coastal fishing area to investigate the lives of fishermen to write the script for "South China Sea Storms," because the main description of "South China Sea Storms" is to reveal the struggles and hardships of fishermen's lives, and to infuse it with national defense consciousness, making it a more advanced work than Cai's famous work "Song of the Fishermen."

After Situ Huimin came to Hong Kong, he cooperated with Cai Chusheng to produce "Blood Splattered on Baoshan City," which was highly praised by the media when it was released. Recently, he completed another film, "Guerrilla March," which, as the name suggests, is another national defense film full of national consciousness, starring Zhang Yi and Jin Ling (formerly known as Rong Xiaoyi, a member of the Plum Blossom Dance Troupe), etc. There are two songs in it, co-written by Ren Guang and An E.

Cinematographers Rush to the Front Line

The famous director Sun Yu is now working as a screenwriter and director at the Luqing Central Film Studio. The Central Film Studio is also a state-run film production organization, affiliated to the Film Section of the Central Propaganda Department. The feature films recently produced by the studio include "Chinese Sons and Daughters" (written and directed by Shen Xiling, starring Bai Yang, Yue Dan, Shi Chao, Gu Eryi, and Wei Heling), "The Nation's Mother" (written and directed by Pan Jinong, starring Zhao Dan and Wang Ping), "Ten Thousand Miles of the Long Sky" (written and directed by Sun Yu, starring Gao Zhanfei and Bai Yang), "Wandering Children" (written and directed by Yu Zhongying, starring Mou Ling), and "Bloody Battle in the Isolated City" (written and directed by Xu Suling, starring Bai Sen and Bai Yun). In addition, cinematographers were assigned to the front line to film newsreels about the Anti-Japanese War. Those assigned to Jiangsu and Zhejiang include Ye Jiong and Lian Cheng, to Anhui and Jiangxi include Luo Jinghao and Yu Jianzhong, to Kangzang include Li Xixun, to Xinjiang include Zong Weigeng, to Guangdong and Guangxi include Huang Tianpeng, to Hunan and Hubei include Tong Zhen, and those stationed in Chongqing include Qiu Yiyi, Hong Weilie, Chen Weimo, Wang Yusheng, and Wang Letian. According to Mr. Li Gongge, the representative of the studio in Hong Kong, the newsreels that the Central Film Studio has shown in various places in the past have been very popular with audiences, and the business income is not only sufficient to cover the usual expenses, but also has a surplus, which is enough to show a glimpse of the people's spirit.

### A Record of the Test Screening of "Tears of Flowers"

— Tianma

"Tears of Flowers" is Mr. Yu Ling's new work. Since the news of the play being handed over to the "Shanghai Drama and Art Society" for rehearsal was revealed, all parties have paid considerable attention to it. Yesterday morning, the play was test-screened for the first time at the Carlton. The setting was a picture of the lives of men and women in a dance hall between May and August 13, 1937.

The Opening Was Delayed by Forty-Five Minutes

In order to entertain the press and relevant parties, this rehearsal was held in the morning at the Carlton. Watching a free show is quite interesting. In the small theater, the seats below were already seven or eight full before ten o'clock. There were reporters, playwrights, and cultural figures inside. Mr. Yu Ling was still in his artistic nature, with dark crystal glasses perched on a head of disheveled hair. The set and makeup time was too rushed, so the opening was delayed by forty-five minutes.

Interesting Things

The first act was set against the background of a dance hall in Shanghai. The audience seemed very familiar with the Lambeth Walk music. Lan Lan's "Dance Girl's Song" was emitted by the loudspeaker in a loud voice, which was quite pleasant to listen to.

In the third act, at the moment Mimi committed suicide, Lan Lan raised a bottle of LaSalle's medicine and poured it into a glass to drink, and suddenly a clear "Beef Juice" sound was heard from the stage, and then everyone laughed. Xia Xia hurried up to stop her from committing suicide. By accident, the glass fell on the stage, and "Beef Juice" splashed open, soaking a large area of my black coat in the front row. The glass was broken, and fortunately the "Beef Juice" was not real LaSalle.

It's Hard for the Actors

There are not many actors in the whole play, but because it is necessary to suit the plot, the male actors are wearing white serge suits, but the female actors are wearing thin cheongsams, which are not warm enough anyway. As a result, the red frozen ears and slightly trembling silver teeth had a slight effect on the vocal cords when singing. Friends sitting next to the radiator could not take off their winter coats. Isn't it hard for the actors?

Three Acts Were Performed Out of Four

As I guessed, the Carlton had to open a movie at 2:30, and the four acts could not be finished anyway, and at the end of the third act, the clock pointed to 1:30. A midget gentleman with glasses walked out from behind the curtain to report the reason for the suspension. In fact, there were also a few friends who couldn't stand the hunger and had already slipped away. Originally, if you want to see a neat or purely hot drama, the experience that the performance will get better and better in the final performance is often as real as it is!

### One of the Lyrics Scolding Wang Jingwei (Xipi Erliu Ban)

— Edited and Printed by Zuili Pavilion

Before I speak, I can't help but feel angry. I scold Jingwei, the traitor who sells the country. The late Premier treated you with such trust. I originally hoped that you would abide by his will and complete the cause of the revolution early. If all of China were unified, how fortunate it would be. You should have resolutely implemented the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. Who knew that your desire for wealth and power would grow day by day. Sometimes south, sometimes north, you were used to bragging, flattering, and being completely inconsistent, to the point that even you couldn't explain why. The enemy and I have long established a sea of blood and hatred. But you are confused and unable to distinguish right from wrong, recognizing the thief as your father. What is your motive? A traitor like you is hated by everyone. Even with this mask on, you can't hide your true identity. Stop dreaming and being indecisive. Just roll, roll, roll, roll to a foreign country and be your vagabond!

### Two of the Lyrics Scolding Wang Jingwei (Erhuang Kuai Sanyan Ban)

Fellow countrymen, it's okay if we don't mention Wang Jingwei, but mentioning this traitor Jingwei makes people hate him. Fellow countrymen, listen carefully. Since ancient times, good men should value integrity. Moreover, he is a learned person. The enemy and I have forged a bond of life and death. If I don't resist the enemy, the enemy will swallow me. The people of the whole country are united, fighting him with all their might. This is the traditional spirit of our people. Who knew that the traitor Jingwei was inherently inferior. The idea of seeking peace shook the world. For the sake of the country, he should have presented his case to the court. Why did he sneak out of the Houzaimen? The traitor didn't learn from Han Wudi, exhausting himself for the country. Instead, he learned from the traitor Qin Hui, surrendering to the Jin people. The traitor usually talks about ancient and modern times, source by source, but it seems that he has never read the Juxian Yiweng. It doesn't matter if he earns a bad reputation in this world. I'm just worried that after his death, when he arrives in the underworld, what face will he have, what words will he use, to face the predecessors? Traitor!

### Chaplin's Debut Sound Film "The Dictator" to Begin Filming Next Month

— (Reuters, Hollywood, 7th)

Prepared for Release in Early Autumn

The famous film star Charlie Chaplin, who has always been known for producing silent films, will now be the speaking protagonist in his new film "The Dictator." According to Chaplin, "The plot and dialogue have been completed, and filming can begin on March 15th. I hope to have it ready for release in early autumn." Chaplin added, "The plot is naturally related to dictators, but its primary purpose is to make people laugh. The current political situation is particularly suitable for comedic material. Those who possess excessive dignity and power will ultimately be the target of others' ridicule." It is reported that this film is Chaplin's first performance in a sound film, in which he will play two roles, one as a dictator and the other as an inmate in a concentration camp who resembles the dictator in appearance.

### Gao Baisui

— Wang Hongni

Gao Baisui, courtesy name Bosui, is from the old capital. He is the son-in-law of the famous Kun actress En Xiaofeng and the husband of En Weiming. He studied at Fuliancheng in his youth and showed considerable promise. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, he went south and joined Tianchan, privately imitating Zhou Xinfang's style, combining the strengths of both the Jing and Qi schools. His art was a great success. As the only direct disciple of the Qi school, he excelled in both costume dramas and combat scenes, which were exceptionally intense and well-received by southern audiences. (The picture shows Gao as Zhang Xiu in "Battle of Wancheng.")

### A Brief Account of the Zhou Shoutong Amusement Fair at the Carlton One Evening

— Hai Sheng

Mr. Zhou Yihua, the manager of the Carlton Grand Theatre, celebrated his thirtieth birthday the night before last with a grand theatrical amusement fair. Guests entered with tickets and were only required to donate one dime each to the refugee relief effort. When the reporter arrived, the orchestra and balcony were filled. Li Peilin and Zhang Huicong's "Four Plates Mountain" had already been performed, and Hu Tiwei and Jin Suwen had already sung half of "The Peach Blossom Face." Tiwei is, after all, a playwright, and his scholarly disposition suited him perfectly to play Cui Hu, embodying the refined and romantic scholar. Ge Cijiang helped him with this play, so Lao Ge was backstage managing the scene.

Zhang Wenjuan and Jiang Yunxia's "Pinggui Returns to the Empty Kiln" featured the two as veteran partners. There is no need for me to introduce their artistic skill. In my opinion, they should have sung a different kiln scene, as Yunxia boarded the Moufu ship at one o'clock yesterday afternoon to join a troupe in Ningbo. However, it was not Xue Pinggui saying farewell to Wang Baochuan, but Wang Baochuan saying farewell to Xue Pinggui. This pair of old partners was forcibly separated!

Zheng Guoyi, Tang Yunshang, and Chen Tingchao's "Crossing the River for the Banquet" featured Zheng as Liu Bei, Tang as Kongming, and Chen as Lu Su. In addition, the performer Yu Zongying played Zhao Yun, and Zhang Jinmin played Zhou Yu. Tang and Chen were making their debut on stage, and the audience gave them enthusiastic support. Almost every line they sang or spoke, and every gesture they made, was met with thunderous applause. Guoyi's few Tan-style (谭派) lines were also quite moving.

The grand finale was "The Auspicious Union of Hongluan." Hu Tiwei's portrayal of Mo Ji captured the poverty and sourness of the destitute scholar vividly. Wang Xichun's Jin Yunu was truly a petite and charming young lady. Her glamorous appearance could be described as outstanding among female performers. Wu Tianchang's Jin Song was played very comically, wearing a pair of black glasses, which made him resemble Zheng Zibao, the Master of the Plum Blossom Pavilion. He was, after all, an old hand at this and played the part very naturally. When Xichun finished reciting the line, "Why bring a young, hungry, and cold person into the house?", he said, "You are a kind-hearted girl. Next year, I guarantee you will become exceptionally popular and marry a young, handsome, and learned good son-in-law." The foster father was taking advantage of his foster daughter, and Xichun was both happy and embarrassed. The audience could not stop laughing. This evening of merriment continued until after twelve o'clock before everyone dispersed.

### Secret Histories of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden of the Former Capital (99)

Two Male and Two Female Leads Engage in Real Fights and Curses Over Theatrical Jealousy

Jealousy is originally a characteristic of women, but in theatrical troupes, there is a strange phenomenon of jealousy over roles. When this jealousy arises, it is exceptionally intense. If not handled well, it can lead to real fights and curses on stage, with everyone fighting to the death. As the saying goes, "When two tigers fight, one must be injured." Therefore, the result is always that one person suffers a great loss and takes a tumble before the matter is resolved. Since the founding of the Republic, I have witnessed three such incidents, each involving a pair of performers in the male, female, and painted-face roles, totaling six famous actors. These six famous actors are He Yueshan, Gai Jiaotian, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Hao Shouchao, and Hou Xirui. Coincidentally, there were two male leads, two female leads, and two painted-face roles. I will describe each one in detail below, which will also show that the theatrical virtue of the famous actors of recent times is far worse than that of their predecessors.

More than twenty years ago, there was a brave martial actor in Shanghai named He Yueshan. He wielded real knives and spears in his performance of "The Iron Rooster," as if his life depended on it. When it came to his short-play skills, apart from the elderly Li Chunlai, he could be considered unparalleled in Shanghai. Moreover, he had good stage presence, and his singing was acceptable. Sometimes, he even boasted about his versatility and performed the old female role in "Fishing for a Golden Turtle" in drag. This was similar to the late Lü Yueqiao and the living Chang Ruiting, both of whom sang the old female's tune in the Yi character tone with falsetto voices. However, performers should avoid being too self-satisfied and arrogant and should not try to take all the roles for themselves. Cheng Changgeng, the former head of the Sanqing troupe, was certainly capable of performing famous plays outside of the male role, but he always kept that in reserve. Only when someone in the troupe became conceited would he show his skills and perform a demonstration to let the conceited actor see what he was capable of, so that the conceited actor would give up such bad ideas and focus on performing in the troupe. This was a true skill of the troupe leader in managing colleagues. He never used this to show off his uniqueness, because theatrical virtue requires leaving opportunities for others to earn a living. He Yueshan, because he did not understand the advantages and disadvantages of this, angered Gai Laowu, who saw the injustice and knocked Yueshan down on the stage, causing him to spit blood. From then on, he never recovered, and his reputation declined. This was also the retribution for his boasting about his versatility.
