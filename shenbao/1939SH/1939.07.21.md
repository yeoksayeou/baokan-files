Pingjiang: Chinese troops attacking the Nanlinqiao area in southern Hubei have made continuous progress in recent days. On the 17th, part of the Chinese army thoroughly destroyed the highway near Nanlinqiao in more than ten places. The main force then crossed the highway and advanced towards Tingsiqiao. (20th dispatch)

Miluo: On the evening of the 17th, Chinese troops attacked the Japanese army in the Yanglousi and Shuipu area. The Japanese resisted stubbornly at Luomaqiao, Kangwangqiao and other places. The Chinese army bravely charged, and after two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was overwhelmed, abandoning more than 30 bodies and retreating. The Chinese army has recaptured these areas and is currently advancing. (20th dispatch)

Yichang: The Chinese army launched an attack from the front of the Hanyi Road. A certain unit has advanced to Liujiaji, north of Yanmenkou, and encountered the Japanese army several times along the way, resulting in fierce battles. Many Japanese soldiers were killed and many supplies were captured. Currently, the Chinese army is taking advantage of the victory to pursue the retreating Japanese army to the north. In the Zhongxiang area, the Chinese army is approaching the outskirts of Yangzi. There is a lot of panic within the Japanese army, and they have no ability to resist. Yangzi is expected to be taken soon, and Zhongxiang is essentially surrounded by the Chinese side. (20th dispatch)

Miluo: On the evening of the 18th, a certain advanced detachment of the Chinese army launched a multi-pronged attack on Yanglousi on the border of Hunan and Hubei.

Liuhuang: On the 18th, the Chinese army launched a second major counterattack, fiercely attacking Chaoan City, with forces launching from the southeast and west, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army defending the city. The Chinese army killed many Japanese soldiers, with most of them wounded or killed. The Japanese then set fire to civilian houses to obstruct the advance of the Chinese army, while fleeing towards the northwest of Zhaohulu Mountain and Jinshan. The Chinese army is concentrating its forces to attack. Another main force of the Chinese army advanced southward, reaching the area of Fuyang Gezhou, cutting off the connection between the Japanese army in that area and Shantou. (20th dispatch)

Xingning: Ten Japanese planes took turns bombing various places in Haifeng on the morning of the 20th, dropping bombs like rain, and machine guns swept back and forth non-stop. Then, several Japanese warships shelled Shanwei, launching dozens of motorboats carrying hundreds of Japanese soldiers, forcibly landing. The Chinese garrison immediately resisted bravely, and after several hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and the Chinese army also made heroic sacrifices. Eventually, due to the rapid arrival of Japanese reinforcements, by 2 p.m., all the Chinese fortifications were destroyed by the concentrated fire of the Japanese warships. In addition, with no defensible terrain on the coast, they had no choice but to retreat slightly to more favorable terrain to continue their resistance. The Japanese army is now advancing towards Yaowei, 25 miles from Haifeng, and Chinese reinforcements are heading separately to block them. (20th dispatch)

Zhaoqing: At dawn on the 19th, more than 300 Japanese and puppet troops from Sanshui and Xinan launched a fierce attack on Yangmei along the Sishui "Siihui to Sanshui" and Luxi "Lupao to Xinan" roads, encountering Chinese guerrilla teams.

(Luoyang) After the fall of Changzhi, part of the Japanese army reached the area south of Changzhi at dawn on the 14th, and was blocked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Yicheng seemed to have the intention of crossing the Qin River and invading Jincheng Gaoping. More than 1,000 Japanese troops who invaded westward from Nakamura (southeast of Yicheng) have been ambushed by the Chinese army at Baihualing since the 13th, retreated to Maweigou, and most of them detoured to the vicinity of Yujingshan northwest of Dongfeng, and are engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. In recent days, more than 5,000 Japanese troops have gathered near Qinshui, busy preparing rear transportation, and planning to continue their advance. (19th dispatch)

(Luoyang) The Qinshui area, Yancheng fell on the morning of the 15th, and subsequent troops increased to more than 3,000. On the 17th, they forcibly crossed east in the vicinity of Zhenwang (east of Qinshui) and Runcheng Town (east of Yangcheng). By the evening, more than 1,000 people had crossed, and some were continuing to invade eastward along the Qin Gao and Yang Jin highways. More than 3,000 Japanese troops from Jingchangzi invaded Hengshui Village from the west on the 14th, and have now penetrated into Nankongtan. In the northeast and east of Qinshui, the Chinese troops are confronting the Japanese army separately in the Qinshui area and on the south side. (19th dispatch)

(Luoyang) Three to four thousand Japanese troops from Zhangma and Nakamura invaded eastward from the 14th and were intercepted by a certain unit of the Chinese army near Nanyang Village. Until the 17th, the Chinese University launched a counterattack, selecting many daredevils to rush directly into the village and recapture Nanyang Village Jiaokou "northwest of Dongfeng" in one fell swoop. The remnants of the Japanese army collapsed towards Dongfeng. The Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unstable foothold and pursued them near Dongfeng, fighting fiercely until noon, occupying the line of Tianjiazhuang "southeast of Dongfeng" and the upper and lower Lotus Mountains "south of Dongfeng", cutting the Japanese army into several sections and continuing to encircle and annihilate them. More than 60 Japanese troops from Qinyang advanced from Daxiakou Village "north of Lanche Town" to the line of Huajian Shiling "south of Lanche" on the 16th, attempting to occupy Jincheng. After being intercepted by a certain unit of the Chinese army in the middle, the fighting lasted for a day and a night, and is still in stalemate. (19th dispatch)

### British Cabinet Considers Expanding Loans to China Due to Further Depreciation of Chinese Currency; Amount of Stabilization Fund to Be Increased

(London) Due to the further depreciation of the Chinese currency, the British Cabinet is considering expanding the £5 million loan to China for the stabilization fund to £10 million. According to financial experts here, if Britain does not continue to support the Chinese currency, Japan's continued monopoly in North China and the Yangtze River basin will proceed smoothly. However, the occurrence of this situation during the British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo is quite embarrassing for Britain. (19th Associated Press dispatch)

(Hong Kong) The rumor in Shanghai that Song Ziwen, chairman of the Bank of China and former Minister of Finance, will soon hold an important position in the Chinese government has not been confirmed here. Song's secretary declined to comment on the matter when visited by Reuters. Well-informed sources here indicate that this rumor is a hope, as the legal tender can be stabilized if Mr. Song resumes his government position. (20th Reuters dispatch)

(London) The Financial News commented on the recent depreciation of the Chinese currency today, mentioning the question of whether Britain should continue to support it, stating that the stability of the Chinese currency is undoubtedly in the interests of British trade. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon had confirmed this policy just a few days ago. The rapid exhaustion of the original £10 million fund may prove to be the cause of the current situation, as the foreign exchange obtained from exports is now gradually falling into the hands of the Japanese. A large portion of the original fund has actually been handed over to Japan, and another large portion has been used to facilitate foreign exchange speculation and the export of capital. Although this second loophole has now been closed, it is still necessary to implement stricter controls on imports to ensure that they are not paid for in Japanese currency. If this can be done, then continued assistance may achieve its purpose, as the situation of the Chinese currency has not yet fallen into chaos. Therefore, it is hoped that a solution can be found in the midst of the difficulties. Judging from the critical tone of the Japanese side, if the British side retreats slightly during these Tokyo negotiations, it will be regarded as a sign of British weakness. (19th Reuters dispatch)

### Arita Listens to Military's Breath, British-Japanese Talks on the Verge of Rupture; Many Discrepancies in Opinions Between the Two Sides; Future Depends on Today's Negotiations; Ambassador Craig Sends Secretary to Tokyo

(Tokyo) According to sources in diplomatic circles, the British-Japanese conference is in danger of breaking down today because the Japanese side insists on discussing general abstract principles before discussing the Tianjin issue. During yesterday's talks, Arita left the meeting room from time to time to exchange views with representatives of the military, and therefore firmly insisted that Britain must recognize its past attitude in China, which was not a neutral attitude, and must guarantee that it will cooperate with Japan in the future. However, Craig replied that his government has not been given the power to admit mistakes and provide guarantees, so the talks have reached a deadlock. Unless the attitudes of both sides change, the talks will inevitably fail. It is said that Craig is extremely pessimistic about future talks, and the British side has prepared for the breakdown of the conference and the actions after the breakdown, such as the withdrawal of expatriates from Tianjin, etc. (20th Associated Press dispatch)

(Tokyo) The Kokumin Shimbun expressed dissatisfaction with the general discussion of the background of the Tianjin situation, saying that the general issues should include Britain's attitude towards the whole of China, not just Tianjin. The Miyako Shimbun said that the future of the Tokyo talks is bleak and there is little hope. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that the negotiations are now almost at a standstill. (20th Reuters dispatch) Foreign Minister Arita met with Prime Minister Hiranuma today to report on his meeting with British Ambassador Craig. According to Japanese sources, qualified Japanese observers claim that the Japanese government now firmly demands that Britain must recognize Japan's military, political, economic and other measures in the war zone. Therefore, the British-Japanese talks seem to be on the verge of rupture. (20th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Regarding the negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities in Tokyo, the Foreign Office received a detailed report from Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and will issue further instructions today to enable the Ambassador to continue talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita tomorrow. (20th Havas dispatch)

(Tokyo) It is known today that Alan, the secretary of British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived in Tokyo on the 10th of this month to assist Ambassador Craig in the British-Japanese conference in the capacity of advisor. (20th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) This morning, Japanese newspapers commented on yesterday's meeting between the British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister, saying that judging from the situation of yesterday's talks, many differences of opinion have become clearer. It is said that the British Ambassador has frankly accepted some points from Foreign Minister Arita, but has expressed strong opposition to other points that he believes affect Britain's prestige. Therefore, tomorrow's negotiations are extremely important, and the success of the Tianjin incident conference depends on the extent of Britain's concessions to the various demands made by the Japanese side to the British Ambassador. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the various requirements are as follows: (1) Britain recognizes the state of war within China; (2) Britain ceases all actions that are hostile to Japan under the pretext of protecting its interests; (3) Britain does not obstruct the means that the Japanese army considers necessary to maintain peace, order and survival. (20th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie stated the following three points during his second talk with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday: (1) Britain is willing to consider all Japanese demands related to the Sino-Japanese conflict, but must avoid the impression that Britain is surrendering to Japan; (2) Britain will consider the changed situation in North China and decide on measures to resolve various disputes; (3) No unilateral demands should be made in the current negotiations. Foreign Minister Arita also stated the following two points to the British Ambassador: (1) Japan demands that Britain cease all activities that hinder Japan's military activities in China; (2) When discussing basic principles, Japan will not consider any compromise plans or mutual concessions, but requires a clear "yes" or "no" from the British side.

### British MP Demands Economic Sanctions Against Japan; Chamberlain Meets US Ambassador

(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Conservative MP Sir Milner Ward asked about the issue of Japan's discrimination against British commercial interests in China, saying, "Japan's actions to hinder British commercial interests in China are becoming more and more serious. The government should notify the Japanese authorities and inform them that if the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is not lifted and the discrimination against British trade in China is not stopped, Britain will take economic measures against Japan. I wonder if the government has this intention." Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied, "British-Japanese negotiations have begun in Tokyo, and the government hopes to resolve the various outstanding issues concerning the Tianjin incident through negotiations." (19th Havas dispatch)

### Order on Yunnan-Burma Highway Good; Impressions of US Representative

(Chongqing) Arnold, a representative of the American Motor Company, recently arrived in Chongqing after traveling for twelve days on the new Yunnan-Burma Highway in the rain. He said that the traffic maintenance on the new highway is better than expected. The Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau now dispatches teams to patrol the road day and night in sections, so even though it is raining and the soil is collapsing, vehicles are still coming and going. The farmers along the road have all been trained, so when there is a landslide, they can gather hundreds of farmers within two or three hours to clear it completely. The Bureau also has resident labor teams stationed at key stations along the road to prepare for emergencies. The Southwest Transportation Company currently operates 1,000 trucks between Myanmar and Kunming, averaging 60 to 100 tons of cargo per day. After the rainy season, the tonnage is expected to triple. It seems that China can ensure victory in the battle against rain. (20th Reuters dispatch)

It is heard that the purpose of this case is to create a reserve team that does not hinder the usual work of the British. (20th Reuters dispatch)

They are still fiercely pursuing the Japanese army. (20th dispatch)

Editorial

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo

Regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo concerning the Tianjin incident, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hachiro Arita, held their first round of talks on the 15th of this month. The content of the talks was not announced, only stating that both sides declared their respective positions. According to a Tokyo dispatch, they held their second round of talks on the morning of the 19th. According to general observations, the current discussion between the British and Japanese sides concerns the scope of the negotiations. From the perspective of public opinion in both countries, Britain only hopes to treat the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin as a local issue and discuss a solution, attempting to maintain all its interests in Tianjin through a neutral stance. Therefore, it only proposes the extradition of the suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xi-geng and the improvement of concession administration as the basis for negotiations. However, Japan hopes to resolve all Anglo-Japanese disputes in China through these negotiations, demanding that Britain recognize the new situation in the Far East created by Japan. In other words, it is tantamount to demanding that Britain recognize Japan's victory over China. The victory has already been determined, and at the same time, it has already defeated Britain, and Britain should abandon its interests in China. The aims of both sides can truly be said to be poles apart!

To give an example: Party A says I want to buy a base, and Party B says I want to repair a house. These two are fundamentally not about the same business, so how can a deal be reached? But Party A and Party B actually exchange greetings and intend to start bargaining. Isn't this a joke? What Britain and Japan want to resolve is not the same issue. The so-called scope of negotiations has not been determined, but in reality, the issues for negotiation have not been determined. So what is there to negotiate about? Yet negotiations have begun. This is also a joke. Jokes are unfolding one after another, but some people have a different understanding. When the Tokyo negotiations were first announced, Germany, Italy, and Japan all called it the "Munich Conference of the Far East," implying that Britain would inevitably make concessions. This statement exposed their extravagant hopes. Also, because Britain, under the pressure of Japan's military blockade, did not adopt effective resistance measures but instead demanded peaceful negotiations with Japan, it has already made significant concessions in practice.

However, this cannot be regarded as a change in Britain's Far Eastern policy. Britain's Far Eastern policy is a part of its national policy. Any country that possesses an independent national character will never have its national policy changed due to the interference of other countries. Britain will not hastily change its national policy due to Japan's various insults, oppressions, and attacks, just as China's resolute resistance is for the sake of national independence and national character, unwilling to change its own national policy under the oppression of other countries. This can be seen from the British government's repeated declarations, which can lead people to believe that Britain, even in its current difficult situation, will ultimately not change its Far Eastern policy.

Moreover, in terms of realistic interests, Britain also has no possibility of changing its Far Eastern policy. In this round of Japan's war against China, its military target is China, but economically, Britain is also one of its targets. In China's industry and mining, there are many British investments. Most of China's shipping belongs to British merchants, and China's foreign trade is mostly with Britain and its affiliated colonies. If Britain recognizes Japan's so-called "new situation in the Far East," it must abandon these interests in China. Even, in order to satisfy Japan's desire to complete its continental policy, it must withdraw its forces from various places in the Far East. Recently, there was an anti-British movement in Guangzhou to reclaim Kowloon, and leaflets inciting Indians to oppose the British were also discovered in Hong Kong. If Britain's interests in China cannot be protected, it is feared that its influence in other parts of the Far East will also be difficult to maintain. This is not just a matter concerning the prestige of the British Empire.

In this round of negotiations, Japan is in a relatively advantageous position in terms of the situation. Not only do the anti-British movements in Japan and the occupied areas of China demonstrate Japan's capabilities, but Japan's complete prohibition of British economic activities in the occupied areas and its formal and informal blockade of concessions in various places are even more signals hoping for concessions from the British side. If Japan's demand for Britain to "recognize the new situation in the Far East" is only considered in terms of each individual part, it is indeed possible to adopt a tough stance. However, Japan's true intention may not be to hope to completely achieve its goal. The reason for making excessive demands is probably just a kidnapping-style bargaining policy. Its demand that Britain recognize the new situation in the Far East created by Japan single-handedly is a huge bargaining chip. As long as Britain is willing to concede an inch, it will be the basis for Japan to gain a foot of progress, and Japan will also be willing to temporarily end this negotiation. Then, it will implement its consistent policy, treating the clauses in the agreement that are beneficial to Japan as a legal basis and implementing them earnestly. The so-called Shanghai Customs Agreement signed by Britain and Japan last year is an example. Japan used the provisions of the agreement to control the Jianghai Customs, but it has never fulfilled the debts that the agreement stipulated should be paid to Europe and the United States. Japan's policy of gradual encroachment to gradually reduce the influence of various countries in China is a relatively safe method. Therefore, in this negotiation, Japan may not insist that Britain recognize the new situation in the Far East. If Britain makes concessions on other points because Japan will not insist on this point, it will be helping Japan's strategy. We believe that the experienced and prudent British will not fail to see this point and end up falling into a path of chronic self-destruction!

### Soviet Union Retracts Japanese Protest, Soviet-Japanese Relations Worsen Again, Soviet Union Plans to Abolish Japanese Rights in Northern Sakhalin, Japanese Naval Authorities Claim They Still Have the Capacity to Deal With It

(Moscow) According to sources close to the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Soviet government is currently considering canceling Japanese special rights in northern Sakhalin. If this materializes, then the Japanese "observers" on the island may be eliminated. (Haidao Telegraph, 20th)

(Moscow) According to Japanese sources here last night, the dispute between the Soviet Union and Japan regarding oil and coal rights in northern Sakhalin is more serious than the border war between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia. The Soviet court sentenced the Japanese transferee to a fine of 374,000 rubles on July 11 for failing to fulfill its obligations to Soviet workers. Japan protested to the Soviet government and demanded a reply by noon yesterday, which was rejected by the Soviet Union. The deadline for paying the fine expires at midnight today. Japanese sources with good information claim that if the Japanese company does not pay the fine tonight, the company will face the danger of being confiscated by the Soviet Union. The Japanese government believes that this dispute is related to Japan's prestige, and Japan may be forced to take "serious measures" after the deadline to maintain its prestige. (20th)

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Navy Department, Vice Admiral Kanazawa, issued a statement saying that the Japanese naval authorities are increasingly concerned about the Soviet Union's continued threats and attacks on Japan's fishing and coal rights in northern Sakhalin. If the Soviet Union believes that Japan is currently too busy dealing with the China incident, then it is mistaken. Japan is by no means without the capacity to pay attention to Sakhalin. (Haidao Telegraph, 20th)

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Navy Ministry stated today that the Japanese Navy is extremely concerned about the Soviet government's unreasonable oppression of Japanese fishermen in the North Sea and Japanese oil and coal concession rights in northern Sakhalin. The Soviet Union and Japan are currently conducting serious diplomatic negotiations on this matter. (Reuters, 20th)

### Tianjin Concession, Blockade Procedures to Be Intensified, Film Actors and Actresses Banned from Entering

(Beiping) The Tianjin Police Bureau has reportedly ordered the police to prohibit film actors and actresses from entering the concession, which is part of the procedure to strengthen the blockade of the Tianjin concession. (Reuters, 20th)

(Chongqing) An English-language newspaper published here this morning commented on the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo, saying that Britain does not need to make concessions to Japan on fundamental issues in this negotiation. If Japan does not abandon its policy of forcing Britain to cooperate with Japan in its aggression against China, then the Tokyo conference can be broken off at any time. If the interests on which Britain's rise and fall depend must still be protected, then the Chamberlain government cannot tolerate a second Munich failure. (Reuters, 20th)

### Mengzi Customs, Restrictions on Imports, Rejection of Luxury Goods

(Kunming) The Mengzi Customs has been ordered to reject luxury goods from entering the country from today. All foreign tobacco and alcohol, cosmetics, paper, clothing, silk goods, cotton and wool fabrics, canned food, seafood, sugar and vegetables, lace, buttons, toys, musical instruments, bird's nest, etc., are all on the banned list. However, it is still questionable how effective this regulation will be. (Reuters, 20th)

### Japanese Political Parties Actively Inciting Anti-British Sentiment, Encouraging Chinese Employees Hired by the British to Resign, Japanese Residents in Pingri Hold Mass Meeting, Mobs in Jinan Attack British Industries

(Beiping) The New People's Society, a political party organized by the Japanese, is currently using all methods to incite anti-British sentiment. Its most recent actions include publishing a half-page advertisement, asking Chinese people employed by the British to resign immediately, and Chinese landlords to take back all houses rented to the British. Those who do not comply will be regarded as "disrupting the efforts to establish a new order in East Asia" and will be dealt with accordingly, and their families will be punished. This intimidation has already had an impact on more restless Chinese employees. At the same time, newspapers controlled by the Japanese continue to attack British church schools, accusing them of "cultural aggression." According to Japanese sources, "after the Chinese authorities in Kaifeng issued an ultimatum," 21 British people in the area left the country on July 17. Japanese residents in Beiping held a mass meeting late yesterday and passed a resolution to "expel the British from Asia." (Reuters, 19th)

(Beiping) Japanese sources reported that mobs in Jinan attacked British industries. It is said that a large number of Chinese mobs entered the office of a British shipping company yesterday and destroyed all the furniture and equipment inside. When two other British firms were attacked by the mobs, they quickly closed their doors and windows, "but there was no major damage. At that time, Japanese military police arrived and dispersed the mobs." Japanese sources also said that six British residents in Kaifeng who were threatened by local Chinese authorities and ordered to leave the country on July 19 are currently preparing to go to the coast. However, this statement has not been confirmed. (Reuters, 19th)

(Tianjin) The Japanese here plan to organize a large-scale boycott of British goods movement from today to threaten British merchants who are already unable to move. The method is that the New People's Society, directed by the Japanese, will organize an anti-British boycott committee and send inspectors to be stationed at the entrances and exits of the concession to prevent British goods from entering and leaving the concession, and to carry out publicity campaigns to boycott British goods, advising shops not to sell British goods. If there are losses, they will be compensated by the "official". A disciplinary committee will be established to punish those who knowingly violate the rules. (Associated Press, 20th)

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the Tianjin Anti-British Movement Committee has now drafted measures to boycott British goods, including the appointment of inspectors and special agents to promote the boycott. The task of the inspectors is to urge all shops and warehouses to stop selling British goods. However, the committee will compensate for the trade lost by the shops. It is reported that the committee has suggested organizing a special control agency for the sale of British goods. (Reuters, 20th)

### Hong Kong's Trade with China Greatly Reduced

(Hong Kong) According to official government statistics, Hong Kong's trade with China in the first six months of 1939 has been greatly reduced, with a total reduction of 100 million yuan, mostly due to the Japanese seizure of Guangzhou and Jiangmen and restrictions on the Chinese coast. However, the impact of the occupation of Shantou is not yet included. (Reuters, 20th)

### Issue of Amending US Neutrality Act, Roosevelt Still Plans to Take Action, Only Hoping That Europe Will Not Go to War Within Months, President's Debate with Isolationists

(Washington) Supporters of the government are excited again today, believing that President Roosevelt will eventually take action on the Neutrality Act to align it with his foreign policy. It is also clear that the Republican Party does not dare to use the issue of neutrality as a point of contention between the parties. Government circles feel that if the President presents the case to the people in a calm and impartial tone, he will undoubtedly gain approval. Senator Vandenberg, the designated Republican candidate in the presidential election, declined to comment. It is said that Vandenberg does not want to involve the neutrality issue in the election campaign, because the President's foreign policy has won the support of a majority of people who do not belong to any party and the majority of important newspapers. Congressional representatives have different opinions on the President's decision to abandon the struggle to discuss the Neutrality Act in this congressional session. Many supporters of the government believe that although the President will give speeches to the public and explain the Neutrality Act issue during his tour of the West, he will not engage in a propaganda campaign for his policy, as President Wilson did for the League of Nations.

(Washington) According to political figures, the meeting that President Roosevelt convened with Vice President Garner, Secretary of State Hull, and the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties in the Senate at the White House last night was extremely complicated. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull had a verbal battle with Republican Senator Borah. Borah said that his views on the European situation were very different from those of the President and the Secretary of State. Then, many different opinions were expressed and questioned each other until Vice President Garner spoke. Garner then asked Senate Democratic Leader Barkley if he was confident that the Senate would overturn the decision of the Foreign Relations Committee and submit the Neutrality Act issue to discussion in this session. Barkley replied in the negative. President Roosevelt then asked Barkley to publicly declare in the Senate that the Senate was responsible for the Neutrality Act issue. Borah immediately protested, saying that the Senate was originally responsible. "Fortunately, the United States is not ruled by people like Hitler." Another Republican Senator, Austin, said that if war breaks out in Europe, the Senate can quickly revoke the arms embargo clause. At this point, President Roosevelt expressed his intention to give multiple speeches, publicly raising the Neutrality Act issue in order to appeal directly to public opinion. Borah also replied that he was not afraid of the President's strategy. (Havas, 19th)

(Washington) Presidential Secretary Early said that if a European war breaks out during the congressional recess, the President will convene a special session of all members of Congress to decide on the actions that the United States should take, and said, "I am sure that President Roosevelt will pray to Congress with unprecedented sincerity that no new crisis will occur in Europe before the reconvening," but according to recent intelligence from Europe, there is a high probability of a crisis occurring within the next few months. (Associated Press, 20th)

(New York) President Roosevelt's decision to postpone the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment was recently commented on by the New York Times and the New York Evening Post. Both said that if war breaks out in Europe, the United States will definitely assist the democratic countries in resisting the dictatorial countries. The New York Times stated, "To put it bluntly, President Roosevelt's failure this time is enough to encourage the aggressive countries to use war and the threat of war as a means of conquest, because if the military equipment and ammunition needed by a certain country for legitimate defense during wartime are supplied by the United States, it must wait until Congress reconvenes in January of next year before there is a legal way to implement it. Does the American people want to maintain peace or can they maintain peace in a large-scale European war? Regarding the first level, there is no doubt. Regarding the second level, we can answer with considerable confidence that the majority of the American people all believe that if the European countries are caught in the vortex of war, it will be difficult for the United States to stay out of it." The New York Evening Post agreed, briefly saying, "Senator Borah's victory yesterday was a reality, but if war breaks out in Europe within a few months, then Borah's victory will be in vain. The American nation will have to deal with various practical problems at that time, and the disputes of the past few weeks will definitely not have any impact on the solution of these practical problems. This can be asserted." (Havas, 19th)

(Washington) The current Congress will announce its recess in two weeks and will reconvene in January of next year. As soon as Congress adjourns, President Roosevelt will set off on a tour of the country, giving multiple speeches along the way to guide public opinion and make it clear that the Neutrality Act urgently needs to be amended. A White House spokesman recently said that President Roosevelt believes that the international situation may become tense before Congress reconvenes, so he retains the right, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, to convene Congress to hold a temporary session if he believes it is necessary for the international situation, in order to amend the Neutrality Act. (Havas, 19th)

### New Guns Installed on British Military Aircraft

(London) British destroyers and fighter planes have now been equipped with motorcycle guns. Britain has always kept the new equipment secret, and the outside world initially knew nothing about it until Aviation Minister Sir Kingsley Wood made a public announcement in the House of Commons that fighter guns were already being manufactured on a large scale in this country. The guns are being manufactured in large quantities in new British armories and were developed from the Hispano-Suiza motorcycle gun. The gun was originally manufactured in France, and the motorcycle gun is built into the aircraft engine and can fire one-pound shells at the same speed as a machine gun, nine hundred rounds per minute. The gun's magazine can hold armor-piercing shells, explosive shells, tracer shells, and signal shells. (Associated Press, 20th)

### US-China Bill Stalled, Discussions Abound in the United States

(Washington) After President Roosevelt decided to postpone the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment issue, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the government will definitely gain increasingly strong support from public opinion for the Neutrality Act plan, so it will be easier to pass when the case is discussed after Congress reconvenes in January of next year. "If any other government takes aggressive action during the US congressional recess, the attitude of US congressmen will naturally change. If a major war breaks out as a result, President Roosevelt will definitely convene Congress to hold a temporary session to discuss the Neutrality Act issue. At that time, the government will also ask Congress to transfer the necessary powers to be able to respond to the situation." Florida Democratic Senator Pepper also said that he agreed that the Neutrality Act issue depended on public opinion. Rhode Island Democratic Senator Green said, "Postponing the discussion of the Neutrality Act issue until the next session of Congress is a major blow to peace-loving people in the country and peace-loving countries around the world." (Havas, 19th)

(Washington) After President Roosevelt decided to postpone the submission of the Neutrality Act issue to the next session of Congress for discussion, observers recently commented, saying that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull both believed that a crisis would occur in the European situation in a short period of time. If the United States could revoke the arms embargo clause at this time, it might have a good impact and eliminate the scourge of war. However, isolationists such as Senator Borah believe that the claim that a European war is about to break out is an exaggeration, so they advocate that it is not appropriate to take action at the moment. In short, this decision was made because public opinion was not fully prepared and failed to urge Congress to pass the plan proposed by the government. This is also admitted by Democrats. As for the reason why members of Congress opposed the President, the root cause lies in domestic political issues, not party issues. This can be seen from the fact that the arguments put forward by Secretary of State Hull are exactly the same as those made by former Republican Secretary of State Stimson when the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred in 1931. (Havas, 19th)

(Washington) After President Roosevelt decided not to ask Congress to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment issue during this session, US newspapers all recognized that the psychological impact of this matter was more serious than the actual impact, and feared that the totalitarian countries would regard it as encouragement and resume their aggression. The New York World-Telegram, known for its opposition to the "New Deal," also published an article this morning, warning German Führer Hitler not to misunderstand the attitude of the United States. It said, "The power of US public opinion can make Congress reconvene quickly and revoke the arms embargo clause. Führer Hitler must understand this before instigating a European war." In addition, political commentator Lippmann raised several questions to the State Department: (1) Do we want Singapore to belong to Britain or Japan? (2) Do we want the British fleet to withdraw from the Far East and the rubber, various metals, and kerosene produced by British India and the Dutch East Indies to become the assets of Zhou Xin country? (3) Do we want to sit idly by and watch the British Isles become a tiny dot on the world map, the British fleet being sunk or captured by Germany, and watch Hitler and Mussolini become the masters of the two continents of Mo Fei and exert pressure on Latin America? "If the above questions can be answered, then the whole problem can be clarified." (Havas, 19th)

### Roosevelt Convenes Refugee Relief Conference, Invites Representatives from Britain, France, Brazil, and Other Countries to Discuss in Washington

(London) After the International Committee for the Relief of Refugees held a meeting here this afternoon, it issued a formal communiqué, which briefly stated that US President Roosevelt has invited representatives from Britain, France, Brazil, Argentina, and other countries to go to Washington in early September of this year to hold a conference to discuss international refugee relief issues. In addition, the chairman of the committee, British representative Lord Winterton, proposed that the principle decided at last year's Evian Conference, namely, that governments should not directly assist refugees with cash, be modified. Regarding this point, representatives from other countries said that they needed to consult with their respective governments for a solution. According to reports, the International Committee for the Relief of Refugees is currently studying the transfer of Jews to various places in South America, Dutch Guiana, British Guiana, Central America, Santo Domingo, and British Northern Rhodesia in Africa. To date, private organizations in various countries have donated a total of £15 million for the relief of Jews, of which £10 million is in cash and the rest is in goods. (Havas, 19th)

(Havas dispatch, 19th)

(New York) Yu De, the former chairman of the American Aircraft Manufacturers Association, recently submitted a report on the global aviation market situation, stating that in 1938, Germany and Italy sold more aircraft and aviation materials to eighteen countries than the United States. In addition to selling on credit and signing barter agreements, the governments of the Axis powers also sent aviation groups to visit various countries. They also sold more aircraft and aviation materials in six Latin American countries than the United States. However, in terms of total exports, the United States still ranked first, with total exports of aircraft engines and various parts totaling $68,209,050. Next was Germany, with $27,0183,501; third was the United Kingdom, with $26,501,340 (Note: Germany surpassed the United Kingdom, making it the first runner-up); fourth was Italy, with $8,821,493; and fifth was France, with $3,752,208. The combined total for Germany and Italy was $36,004,994, while the combined total for the United Kingdom and France was only $30,253,548. Germany's exports of aircraft and parts to Japan were worth $4,303,544. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### *The Times* Comments on Anglo-American Goods Exchange Agreement

(London) *The Times* commented on the Anglo-American goods exchange agreement, stating that the International Rubber Regulation Committee will discuss the matter at its meeting next Tuesday. The implementation of this agreement will require the release of more rubber, so the issue of the quota permitted for the last quarter of this year will inevitably arise. Although rubber producers are willing to cooperate with each other in practical ways to create a reasonable emergency reserve, they may demand guarantees to prevent any abnormalities in labor or market conditions. According to the Anglo-American goods exchange agreement, the United States will supply 600,000 bales of raw cotton to the United Kingdom in exchange for rubber of equivalent value. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### U.S. and Belgium Negotiate Barter Agreement

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull announced at an intelligence briefing yesterday that the United States and Belgium are currently negotiating to establish a similar barter agreement to the one recently signed between the United States and the United Kingdom. Business sources claim that the agreement in this plan stipulates that the United States will exchange cotton, wheat, and corn for rubber and tin from Belgium and its colonies.

### Soviet Supreme Court Deprives Former Envoy to Bulgaria of Citizenship

(Moscow) The Soviet Supreme Court held a trial on the 17th regarding the case of Raskolnikov, the former Soviet envoy to Bulgaria, who deserted his post and fled. The outcome confirmed that the official had indeed deserted the Soviet Union and fled, joined the party of enemies of the people, and refused to return to the country for questioning. The court, in accordance with Articles 319 and 320 of the Russian Federation Code of Criminal Procedure, as well as the Soviet law promulgated on November 21, 1929, on punishing Soviet foreign officials who desert their posts and join the party of enemies of workers and peasants, sentenced Raskolnikov to deprivation of citizenship, making him a person without legal protection.

### German Fleet to Sail to Danzig, Intending to Provoke Poland; Danzig Guards Fire at Border, Polish Official Killed

Warsaw: According to information obtained by German sources here, the German government plans to dispatch several warships to the Free City of Danzig this month without notifying the Polish government in advance, intending to provoke Poland into taking action so that Germany can intervene under the pretext of self-defense. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

(London) Opposition Liberal Member of Parliament, Mander, asked Foreign Secretary Butler in the House of Commons today whether he thought it appropriate to send British and French troops to Danzig "to show our determination to take a firm stand." Butler replied "not appropriate." Mander further asked whether Germany was concentrating artillery in Danzig that could threaten Gdynia. Butler said that the information he had received did not confirm this claim. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Danzig: A Polish customs officer was shot and killed this morning near Bostelau by a German Danzig customs officer. The incident is currently under investigation. According to the German customs officer, he opened fire in self-defense. The Polish diplomatic representative here protested to the Danzig Senate yesterday against Danzig's restrictions on the rights of Polish customs officers and obstruction of the performance of their duties. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Danzig: After investigation into the case of Polish customs officer Butsenwicz being shot and killed by a German Danzig customs officer this morning, it is reported that the Danzig Senate has expressed its condolences to the Polish Commissioner. Danzig newspapers claim that the incident occurred on Danzig territory, but Polish officials insist that Butsenwicz was shot nine yards inside the Polish border. According to unofficial Polish sources, Colonel Subokinski, the Polish Commissioner in Danzig, was arrested but then released. It is said that Subokinski was arrested on a military motorboat and released after the police who boarded the boat warned him that he had violated the regulations of the Free City regarding the passage of military vessels in the area. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Warsaw: Regarding the incident that recently occurred on the border between Poland and the Free City of Danzig, the official circumstances are now announced as follows: This morning at 10 o'clock, a Danzig customs officer and two members of the National Socialist Party entered Polish territory at the border checkpoint in Tlerzyński. A Polish border guard, Pułtycki, came out to stop them and was shot and killed. The perpetrators then fled back to the Free City. After the Polish authorities heard the news, they sent personnel to investigate. At 1 p.m., a representative of the Free City Senate expressed apologies to Trzciński, the Polish High Commissioner to the Free City. All afternoon newspapers in the Free City reported that a Polish official had been shot and wounded, but concealed his death in order to lessen the importance of the case. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(Berlin) Semi-official sources here recently received news from the Free City of Danzig, claiming that a customs officer of the city was ambushed and shot by a Polish civil servant in the town of Pissterau on the border. The customs officer, for self-defense, immediately returned fire and killed the person who shot him. The authorities of the Free City of Danzig immediately sent personnel to the scene to investigate. In addition, the semi-official German News Agency received a detailed report stating that a customs officer of the Free City of Danzig was patrolling the border area when suddenly a Polish civil servant opened fire on him from the Polish border for no reason. The customs officer immediately returned fire, wounding the civil servant. He intended to step forward to check on him and provide assistance, but two other Poles arrived, so he retreated back into the territory of the city to avoid causing other incidents, and immediately reported the information to his superiors. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### Romanian Ports Willing to Be Used by Poland

(London) It is rumored that if Germany and Poland go to war in the future, and the Polish port of Gdynia (on the Baltic Sea coast) is blockaded by Germany, Romania is willing to allow Poland to use its ports on the Black Sea coast. Diplomatic circles here are very interested in this statement, and it is said that Dutch experts studied the possibility of developing the Romanian port of Caratz (on the Danube River) and the port of Constanța (on the Black Sea coast) into free ports for use by all countries several years ago. Since Romania has a treaty of alliance with Poland, it is logical that it would allow Poland to use its ports on the Black Sea coast. However, under the current international situation, discussing this issue would make Hungary feel deeply uneasy, which would be inappropriate and not what Romania and Poland would want. (Havas, 19th)

### Germany Firmly Opposes Any Compromise Solution

(Berlin) The government authorities are extremely indignant upon learning of rumors that Germany has a tendency to seek a compromise on the issue of the Free City of Danzig and have denied it. They stated that any compromise solution will be firmly opposed by Germany, and the purpose of all these rumors is simply to complicate the issue of the Free City of Danzig. The newspapers here today vehemently attacked Poland, and the general public widely spread rumors that the situation in the Free City of Danzig will become tense again in the coming weeks, and that all German cars and trucks will be requisitioned by the government on August 6. Foreign observers said that Berlin is scheduled to hold an air defense exercise at the end of this month, and high-angle guns will be installed on all major buildings at that time, and these rumors have probably arisen as a result. (Havas, 19th)

### Commander-in-Chief of the German Army Speaks in Tanrenburg

(Berlin) General Bai Luosizhi, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, gave a speech to students of the military academy in front of the Hindenburg Memorial near Tanrenburg, ten miles from the Polish border, today, saying, "We do not shy away from war, but we are even less afraid of it." Bai also solemnly declared the Germanic nature of East Prussia, in response to those who wish to seek to establish rights there, stating that soldiers are unwilling to reprimand such errors with words alone. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### German Newspapers Comment on the Polish Territory Issue

(Berlin) Regarding the statement made by Polish military inspector-general General Smigly to British and American reporters that "Poland is determined to defend Danzig by force, even without allies," the Berlin newspapers have written articles commenting on it, declaring that "if Europe wants to complete the work of appeasement, it must first avoid the threat of Polish belligerence." *Münsen City National Daily*, which has close ties with Göring, further attacked Poland's past territorial claims, stating, "The truly Polish territory within the Polish Republic is no more than one-third of the entire territory, and out of 33 million people, only 22 million are purely Polish. The other 11 million, or one-third of the total population, are recognized by the Poles themselves as other ethnic groups, including 4.5 million Ukrainians, 2.5 million Jews, 1.5 million Belarusians, and 1.5 million Germans. Since Poland has so many foreigners residing within its borders, like former Czechoslovakia, is it not difficult to expect them to live in peace and tranquility?" (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

### Britain Provides Concrete Suggestions for the Tripartite Mutual Assistance Agreement; Explains the Meaning of Direct and Indirect Aggression; and the Military Constraints It Is Willing to Accept

(Paris) Regarding the ongoing negotiations in Moscow, the right-wing newspaper *One Day News* recently reported that after exchanging views with the French government, the British government has decided to send new instructions to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, which will define direct and indirect aggression and determine the guarantees that should be given to each country's independence, which are related to the survival interests of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, the military constraints that Britain is willing to accept in the mutual assistance agreement will also be explained. The moderate newspaper *Order* reported that it is not enough for peace-loving countries to simply unite, they must also contact the United States and the Soviet Union, on the one hand, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and France should establish a mutual assistance agreement, and on the other hand, the United States should supply the United Kingdom and France with military supplies. Fortunately, the United Kingdom and France are strong enough to control maritime traffic, so there is no need to worry about the interruption of supplies. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(London) Reuters' diplomatic correspondent learned that the British government is currently considering the report received today from Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, from Moscow regarding his talks with the Soviet Foreign Minister. However, it may not issue any response tonight or may need to consult with the French government on its observations before issuing it. This is expected to be delayed only briefly. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

(London) Observers here mostly believe that Europe will fall into crisis again after the German autumn harvest. On the other hand, the threat to British interests from the Japanese is also becoming increasingly serious, so political circles here mostly hope for the early conclusion of an alliance between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the British Foreign Office also hopes that the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo will not break down, fearing that after the breakdown, the Japanese side will intensify its anti-British movement and cause Britain's prestige in the Far East to be completely swept away. As for the hope that the United States will abandon its isolationist policy and jointly sanction aggressors with Britain, this expectation has now been abandoned. The British government will submit new suggestions to the Soviet Union within a month to make it easier for the Soviet Union to accept. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)

(London) When the House of Commons meets this month, several members will raise questions about the progress of the negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The government has received a report after Sir Seeds, our country's ambassador to the Soviet Union, and the French ambassador to the Soviet Union continued talks with Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov on the 17th of this month, and has exchanged views with the French government." Labor Party Member of Parliament Dalton then asked, "After the British and French governments repeatedly sent instructions to their ambassadors to the Soviet Union, is there now more hope of an agreement being reached than there was a week ago?" The Prime Minister replied, "An agreement has not yet been reached." Labor Party Member of Parliament Ward King further asked, "Is it the Prime Minister's intention that the current negotiations can achieve success before Parliament adjourns for the recess, so that it can be announced to Parliament in a timely manner?" The Prime Minister replied, "I sincerely hope that it can be so." (Havas dispatch, 19th)

(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, it has recently been reported by well-informed sources that the British government will give its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, further instructions, but the content is currently uncertain. Since the Soviet Union raised the issue of the definition of "indirect aggression," the British and French governments have repeatedly exchanged views, believing that the arguments for replying to the Soviet Union should be carefully considered in terms of wording to avoid causing misunderstandings. French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Corbin spoke with Foreign Office officials twice today and had several long-distance telephone conversations with Paris. Diplomatic circles here still hope that the tripartite agreement can eventually succeed, but Conservative Party members believe that the current negotiations should not be allowed to drag on for so long, and there is similar sentiment in the opposition. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 19th)

### British War Office Establishes Middle East Military Region

(London) The War Office recently announced the establishment of a "Middle East" military region and transferred Lieutenant General Wawell, the current commander of the British Southern Military District, to be the commander of the "Middle East" region, whose task is to arrange defenses in the "Middle East" region and to adjust the actions of British troops in the region after the outbreak of war.

### Polish Boycott of French Brandy Carries Political Meaning

Warsaw: Polish tavern owners recently boycotted the famous French wine "Three-Star Brandy" for patriotic reasons. Since then, tavern customers will no longer have the pleasure of drinking brandy. The owner of the French Three-Star Brandy factory is also the publisher of the French left-wing newspaper *沃弗萊报* [*Voltaire*], which recently published an article by Congressman 蒂特 [Ti Te] on the Danzig issue, entitled "France Should Not Shed Blood for Danzig." The wording of the entire article strongly opposed France assisting Poland for the Danzig issue, and Poland therefore launched a movement to boycott French brandy. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

### British Fleet to Visit Eastern Mediterranean

(London) Naval Secretary Shakespeare declared in the House of Commons yesterday that British warships will visit various ports in the Eastern Mediterranean in the near future. The warships that recently visited the Greek capital will proceed to visit various ports of that country. At the beginning of August, the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet will travel to Istanbul aboard his flagship. Several other warships will visit Smyrna. As for whether British warships will visit Romanian and Bulgarian ports, although it has not yet been decided, it is being considered. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

### Obstacles Arise in British Financial Negotiations with Poland and Turkey; Difficulties in Fact Regarding the Purchase of Military Supplies

(London) Regarding the matter of the British government granting Turkey a credit loan of 30 million pounds, negotiations have recently been conducted between the two sides in the Turkish capital. It has recently been learned that difficulties have arisen, and the situation is the same as the negotiations being conducted between the United Kingdom and Poland. Therefore, if the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Poland can achieve satisfactory results, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Turkey can also be resolved accordingly. According to the original agreement, Turkey should use the funds loaned by the United Kingdom to purchase military supplies from the United Kingdom or France, but because the United Kingdom and France are unable to fully supply Turkey's needs for the time being, the country wants to quickly purchase military supplies, so it plans to use part of the funds to order ordnance from the United States and other neutral countries, which is the source of the current negotiation difficulties. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

(London) The Polish financial delegation originally reached an agreement with the British government on a loan and was scheduled to sign an agreement on the 14th of this month. However, because Poland wanted to use a portion of the funds to purchase ordnance from the United States to meet urgent needs, while the United Kingdom insisted that all the funds be used in the United Kingdom, the opinions could not be reconciled. Until noon today, Colonel Kok, the chief representative of Poland, received instructions from his government to return to his country immediately, so he took a route through Paris and returned to Warsaw. Polish sources here recently explained that as long as the British attitude does not change, the financial negotiations between the United Kingdom and Poland will not be able to continue. This can be seen from Colonel Kok's order to return to his country. Regarding this matter, French representatives have been working hard to mediate between the United Kingdom and Poland in order to find a compromise. Although Colonel Kok has left the United Kingdom, it is not certain that the current negotiations will come to a standstill. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(London) Naval Minister Lord Stanhope recently announced in the House of Lords that the House will adjourn on August 4, but there are still many issues on the agenda, and adjournment can only be implemented after several bills proposed by the government are passed. If a financial agreement between Britain and Poland can be concluded in a timely manner, it should also be submitted for a vote. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(London) Colonel Kok, the chief representative of the Polish financial delegation, who had originally been ordered to return to his country, received instructions on the verge of departure to postpone his departure. The British and Polish sides then reopened negotiations. Colonel Kok has held talks with William, a representative of the British Treasury, and will meet with Sir Lees-Rose, the British government's economic advisor, tomorrow. It is reported that General Ironside, the inspector-general of the British overseas garrison, has submitted a report after holding talks with Polish military authorities, praising Poland's strong military strength and solid defenses, but noting that its financial strength is very weak and needs to be remedied. The British government authorities may therefore change their attitude, leading to the hope that the British and Polish sides will be closer. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### British and Polish Staff Talks; Plans to Formulate Action Plan; Poland Hopes Britain Will Supply Military Supplies

(London) According to the *Daily Telegraph*, as a result of the staff talks conducted by Ironside, the British Inspector General of Overseas Colonial Forces, in Poland, a concrete plan of action has been formulated, but its content is still unknown. *Daily Mail* reported that the Polish authorities explained to Ironside Poland's need for military supplies, including heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, small cannons, and machine guns, all of which it hopes the United Kingdom will transport in large quantities. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 20th)

Warsaw: General Ironside, the British Inspector General of Overseas Military Forces, continued talks with the Polish General Staff yesterday. At noon, he visited Polish President Mościcki, who then hosted a banquet, and those invited to accompany him included Polish military inspector-general General Smigly, Foreign Minister Burke, and other senior military officers. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 20th)

### Germanic Group in Hungary Demands Increased Representation in Parliament

Budapest – The German minority within Hungary today issued a thirteen-point demand, one point of which requires that there be at least fifteen German members in the Hungarian parliament. Currently, there are only four. Although Hungarian newspapers have all criticized this demand, they consider it more moderate than the seven-point program released last autumn.

### Japanese Provocation of "Anti-British" Sentiment in North China; Church Properties Attacked; Most Chinese Unwilling to Participate in this Movement

The Tianjin correspondent of the Continental Daily reports on July 10: According to investigations disclosed here, although the Japanese have consistently strived to stir up "anti-British" sentiment in the occupied areas from the Shandong and Hebei coasts to the mountainous regions of Shanxi, the Chinese people not only remain indifferent to this movement but also harbor animosity towards it. Due to their specific circumstances, although their antipathy is deeply rooted, they are bound to

express it passively. They do their best not to actively participate in this movement, but they are often unable to avoid it, particularly in more important cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Qingdao. In these cities, the Japanese and their agents are conducting extensive inspection campaigns, compelling residents to participate in anti-British demonstrations and parades. As far as the Chinese are concerned, there are many reasons why they are hostile to this movement. Regardless of past Sino-British relations, the Chinese have recognized in recent years, especially since the Chinese currency reform of 1935, that Britain has been one of China's

greatest friends. Britain was the first to assist in maintaining the stability of China's new currency. However, according to those returning from traveling in the west and south, the Japanese are not discouraged by the Chinese people's hostile attitude towards the movement they have launched. The Japanese are redoubling their efforts everywhere to "eliminate all British interests in China." They are clearly determined to make the Chinese resent the British people. In pursuing this goal, they fabricate lies and rumors, aiming to "poison" the hearts of the people. According to

foreign travelers in Beijing, Chinese-language newspapers in Beijing (all controlled by the Japanese) and Japanese-owned Western newspapers are prominently publishing anti-British propaganda, detailing all anti-British demonstrations and parades, as well as speeches by participating Japanese and Chinese puppets. Several days ago, the Japanese made a surprising accusation against certain British expatriates in Tianjin, claiming that they were "engaged in espionage activities, supplying bandits with weapons and equipment." Although there is no evidence at all, newspapers controlled by the Japanese have directly published this news. Furthermore, someone associated with the Shanxi Church has arrived here, forcefully claiming that the Japanese in that mountainous province have just begun a thorough campaign to "eradicate all church influence in the province." In the few towns truly under Japanese control,

church properties are often attacked, and almost all Christian institutions in the province are plastered with paper and cloth banners inscribed with anti-British slogans. One of the banners hanging on the wall of a church in Taiyuan urged the public to reenact the Boxer Rebellion. A foreigner arriving from Qingdao also claimed that there is also a fierce anti-British movement there, launched by high-ranking Japanese civilian and military officials, aiming to destroy British interests in the city.

Tombstone of Han Shizhong Destroyed by Hurricane

Suzhou Correspondence: The tombstone of Han Shizhong of the Song Dynasty is located in the Xili area of Lingyan Mountain in Mudu Town, Suzhou Prefecture. It has a history of over 700 years. The stele is 22.5 feet high, with the inscription "Tablet of the Founding Merit of Zhongxing Zuoming Dingguo Yuanxun" bestowed by Emperor Xiaozong, with characters 1.2 feet in diameter. The stele surface contains three thousand nine hundred small characters, arranged in eighty-eight lines, each line with one hundred and fifty characters, written by Zhou Bi of the Song Dynasty. The text was drafted by Hu Xiong by imperial order. The height of the stele forehead and the number of characters are the first monument to record deeds. This time, it was suddenly blown down by a hurricane, and the ancient stele was cut into four sections, including one section of the stele top and three sections of the stele body. The giant tortoise under the stele was also broken due to the collapse of the stele. The destruction of ancient monuments that are nearly a thousand years old by wind is indeed a loss to our country's culture.

### Violent Wind and Rain Turn Chongming into a Waterlogged Land; Japanese Troops Board Ships and Leave Shanghai

Chongming Correspondence: Chongming is isolated in the sea and is often hit by hurricanes. Fortunately, the disasters are minor. On the 12th, a violent wind suddenly rose, accompanied by torrential rain that did not stop for one day and three nights. The sea embankment outside Nanmen was in disrepair due to war and was badly damaged. Unexpectedly, this time, the violent wind and rain caused it to collapse completely, and the sea water rushed straight to the county seat. The suburbs have become a vast ocean, and most of the houses in the city have collapsed. The number of dead and injured is impossible to count. The northeast is a coastal area with a lower terrain, so the disaster is particularly severe. In low-lying areas, only the rooftops can be seen. Many ships in the sea were overturned by the wind. Not only is the entire county's agricultural production completely hopeless, but also the lives and properties of the people have suffered immeasurable losses. The Japanese garrison force and pacification team stationed in Chongming City, Toda Division, also boarded ships, left the city, and went to Shanghai.

### Chongqing Evacuates Population, Builds Suburban Urban Areas; Measures to Control Food Supply Being Drafted

Chongqing Correspondence: In order to thoroughly evacuate the people from the urban area of Chongqing, the highest authorities ordered the four banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank, to lend ten million yuan for the construction of suburban urban areas. Currently, twelve construction sites have been selected, and it has been decided to complete three districts in the first phase. The construction funds, amounting to three million yuan, have been disbursed as loans by the four banks, and the engineering work is currently underway. In addition, in order to ensure that the supply and demand of daily necessities such as grain and flour are balanced, the municipal authorities here have decided to implement control over the grain supply in the urban area. Detailed measures are currently being drafted and will be implemented in the shortest possible time.

### Letter

Having read the news column of the tenth day of this month in your esteemed newspaper, which described the desolation of Dinghai after its fall, stating that the Japanese army's invasion of Dinghai and its subsequent loss within a few hours was truly beyond general expectations, and that according to relevant sources, one of those who guided the Japanese army in attacking the city was the son of a Mr. Lu, the owner of the Xinyi Zhai pharmacy in Nancheng, I was greatly astonished. I have been in Shanghai since last winter, and this spring I took up the position of accounting at the Huaxing Chang Copper and Iron Machinery Foundry, without ever stepping out of Shanghai. The section reported is clearly untrue. Moreover, although Xinyi Zhai was opened by me, my surname is Fang, but it was falsely stated as Lu. This matter concerns my reputation, so I am writing to inform you and request that your newspaper make a correction. Respectfully, Fang Rongfu, July 19th.

### The Evolution and Opinions on the Compilation of Curriculum in Chinese Universities (Part 1): The Curriculum of Universities in the Late Qing Dynasty Was Without System; The National Government Began to Organize After Its Establishment

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education issued an article on "The Evolution and Opinions on the Compilation of Curriculum," which is excerpted below:

The curriculum of schools above the Chinese specialized level was not so chaotic from the beginning. The economics, politics, literature, natural sciences, agriculture, industry, commerce, medicine, and eight disciplines of universities and higher agricultural, industrial, and commercial schools, and the curriculum of advanced normal schools in the late Qing Dynasty, were all detailed in the officially approved school regulations. After the revolution, the regulations for specialized schools promulgated in the first year of the Republic of China and the regulations for universities promulgated in the second year of the Republic of China also had special articles stipulating the subjects of each type of school. What was stipulated may not have been entirely appropriate, and no dates for modification or revision were set, which was somewhat rigid and could not be improved with the evolution of the times. However, the establishment of courses in each school was followed, so that no names were cleverly established and there was no system. Examination was easy and the level was relatively uniform. To seek improvement, there was also a basis. This unified curriculum system has been implemented for twenty years since the establishment of universities in our country.

In November of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the reform plan of the school system was promulgated, the spirit of which was to promote the spirit of civilian education, adapt to the needs of social evolution, seek the development of individuality, and leave more room for local flexibility. Therefore, it advocated the "elective system for universities." As a result, the unified curriculum system of schools above the specialized level was fundamentally shaken. In February of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education, based on the principles of the new school system, formulated and promulgated the regulations for national universities. Article 6 stated that "the duration of study in national universities shall be four to six years, and the curriculum may use an elective system." Regarding the power to formulate curriculum, Article 7 of the regulations stated: "Each department and each department and graduate school of a national university shall establish a professors' meeting to plan the curriculum and its implementation. Each shall be organized by the full professors of the department and graduate school." The same article also stated: "When each department plans the curriculum, lecturers shall also be present." Since the curriculum of each department was formulated by each school itself, it was difficult to avoid each school setting up courses based on personnel, cleverly establishing various names. Due to the different concepts of the principals, the objectives of setting up courses were different. The worst result was that there was no main test, copied from the east, patched from the west, and arranged in a scattered manner. The curriculum of each school evolved into the phenomenon of division and complexity described in the previous section. Moreover, due to the impermanence of personnel changes, the opening of courses was often in a state of change and uncertainty, which became more fragmented.

The spirit of the new school system was originally to promote the spirit of democracy and give excellent people the opportunity to develop freely. However, as a result, universities with insufficient talent were prone to simple curriculum facilities that could not meet social expectations and the level of great efforts. Universities with abundant talent had the disadvantage of tending towards specialization and difficulty in curriculum development. Therefore, in the thirteenth and fourteenth years of the Republic of China, the most developed universities in China were also the most criticized. In May of the seventeenth year, the first National Education Conference declared: "University education should determine standards and improve the level. We resolve to ask the University Council to promulgate the university graduation examination and degree awarding regulations. After that, when each university handles graduation, it should hold a comprehensive examination of the students' past courses. Those who pass will be given certificates and will not be awarded degrees. All bachelor's and master's degrees must be awarded by the University Council after passing the examination or review by the University Council." The declaration also said, "We stipulate the standards for the curriculum, teachers, and equipment of private schools, and engage in active guidance, rewards, or prohibitions." It expressed dissatisfaction with the level of universities and wanted to make partial regulations on university curriculum.

In August of the eighteenth year, the Ministry of Education promulgated university regulations, and then stipulated the basic subjects that should be set up in the first grade. Article 8 of the regulations also stated: "The curriculum distribution and curriculum standards of each college or department shall be determined separately."

In July of the nineteenth year, the regulations for the drafting committee of university curriculum and equipment standards were promulgated. From that time on, the Ministry of Education has been hiring experts to start sorting out the university curriculum. During the era of former Minister Zhu Jia-hua, great efforts were made. In August of the twentieth year, former Minister Zhu reported in the memorial weekly report of the Central Party Headquarters, criticizing the phenomenon of university curriculum focusing on advanced courses and neglecting basic courses, saying, "In the Department of Economics, the Outline of Economics may not be available, but Marx's Capital must be available. In the field of literature, courses such as the History of Literature are not important, and the works of various famous writers must be set up as special courses. In the Department of Geology, there must be a special professorship in paleontology, as for ordinary geology, it does not matter if someone who studies prospecting or civil engineering is called to teach it. In physics, ordinary physics can be ignored, and Einstein's theory of relativity must be available, no matter how the teachers and scholars are. Even the calculus of mathematics can be handled casually by finding someone to take on the task." At the same time, former Minister Zhu pointed out the phenomenon of repetition in the university curriculum, saying, "For example, in the Faculty of Law, if there is already a Chinese Diplomatic History and Unequal Treaties, there is no need to set up another course, because what is there to talk about in Chinese Diplomatic History after the Unequal Treaties are removed? Isn't this redundant to set up such separate courses?" There are also some courses that are not necessary for this department, such as the Geology Department setting up many mining and metallurgy courses, and the Chemistry Department setting up many chemical industry courses. If we take a closer look at the curriculum of domestic universities, we can point out a lot of courses that do not need to be opened separately."

### Unified Enrollment for National Colleges; Principles for Distributing New Students

Electricity Celebration Communication: The Ministry of Education held a unified enrollment for national colleges and universities in the 28th year. On the 8th, the Unified Enrollment Committee registered in the local United Daily to announce the key points of the enrollment brochure in advance. Regarding the principles for distributing the admitted students, the committee has also formulated preliminary distribution methods, so that candidates can refer to them when filling in the desired schools and departments when registering. The distribution principles are recorded as follows: (1) Admitted students will be distributed according to their first choice, regardless of the examination area, in accordance with their grades, and in the order of tons. (2) When the first choice school of the admitted students is full, they will be assigned to the colleges and universities in the examination area and nearby areas according to their second and third choice departments, still in the order of grades. (3) When the first, second, and third choice colleges of the admitted students are full and cannot be assigned, the Ministry will refer to their examination results, examination area, and desired department, and assign them to corresponding colleges. (4) If the desired department is full in all colleges and universities, the characteristics of the examination area and results of the students may be taken into consideration, and other departments with the same nature may be assigned.

### Private Schools in the French Concession Apply to Authorities for Recordation; Request Exemption from Suppression

Since the August 13th Incident in the French Concession, it has been heard that a small number of residents have set up private schools on their own to maintain their livelihoods and enroll students, and there are now no fewer than thirty or forty of them. Recently, because the patrol room has occasionally taken measures to suppress them, it is known that the teachers of each private school have jointly applied to the French Public Works Bureau for recordation and requested that the patrol room personnel be notified to exempt them from suppression, so as to maintain their livelihoods.

Yesterday's results:

China wins Golden City 13 to 7 China Agriculture wins China Enterprise 13 to 4 Dingkang wins China Exchange A 13 to 4 To Whom It May Concern: Our team is a team organized by the school. We registered for this year's China Youth-sponsored Invitational Volleyball Tournament under the names of Xuanlu, Bluestar, and Minfeng, in order to seek progress in technology. However, the grouping regulations and methods recently announced by the China Youth authorities suddenly divide the ordinary and school groups, and set up two championships, which is obviously different from the competition regulations announced by the association when our team registered. After the announcement of this method, it had a great impact on our team, and we immediately raised questions to the association orally in order to seek a fair solution, but unexpectedly, we have never been understood by the association. Under these circumstances, our team has no choice but to withdraw from the league. Xuanlu, Bluestar, and Minlu Women's Volleyball Team Sincerely.

### 1939-40 Men's Basketball Rule Changes

— (Translated by Qu Honglu)

Important basketball rule changes for this season, reviewed and approved by the American National Board Rule Committee, are listed below. Although not yet officially announced, they have generally been passed. Translated excerpts are as follows:

(1) The distance from the backboard to the baseline (end line) is changed to four feet (translator's note: the old rule was two feet or four feet). The maximum and optimal court length should be ninety-four feet, and the distance between backboards is eighty-six feet. (All American schools unanimously approved the change of the distance from the backboard to the end line to four feet, so the Rule Committee has passed this rule.)

(2) After a technical foul free throw, regardless of whether the shot is made or not, the penalized team throws the ball into play at the center line (division line). If it is a personal foul, the penalized team captain has the right to waive the free throw and choose to have their team member throw the ball into play at the center line. If the free throw does not decide the outcome, this rule applies to the last free throw. Double fouls are not included in this example. (The American National Association of Basketball Coaches, in view of the fact that in extremely tense games, the team trailing in the last moment often intentionally fouls, hoping to gain possession of the ball after the free throw. This behavior is detrimental to the true meaning of sports, hence this change.)

(3) If a player shooting the ball is fouled or obstructed from behind by an opposing player, regardless of whether the ball goes in the basket, two free throws should be awarded. (This rule is intended to avoid all kinds of unsportsmanlike and morally crude behaviors.)

(4) Any player on a team can call a "timeout." In other words, calling a "timeout" is limited to the captain alone.

(5) Each team gets one additional "timeout" in each "overtime period."

(The rules committee believes that the "overtime period" is not part of the game time, so in addition to the five "timeouts," one more "timeout" should be added for each "overtime period.")

(6) The words "or backboard" (Dr. Backbord) in Rule 14, Article 9 are deleted.

(Translator's note) In addition to the above six important changes, there are many wording changes, which cannot all be detailed one by one. The rules adopted by the China National Amateur Athletic Federation are those approved by the World Games, and their effective period is from 1936 to 1940. This article is based on the rules approved by the American National Basketball Rules Committee, which are also the rules adopted by the YMCA.

### Stabilizing Foreign Exchange is the Priority

— Hou Ji

The Shanghai foreign exchange black market once sharply contracted on the 18th of this month, but unexpectedly tightened severely in less than three days. Speculators initially targeted futures, considering the limited supply of spot goods as a backup. The futures market, threatened by seven or eight contracts, fluctuated even more sharply, with increasingly disparate bid-ask spreads. Drastic fluctuations in futures affected the stability of spot prices, and in turn, instability in spot prices exacerbated the tightening of futures. These formed a cause-and-effect cycle, repeatedly exacerbating each other, resulting in another surge in commodity prices as expected, which will likely cause even greater difficulties for the people's livelihood. I believe that the current issue should no longer aim for high exchange rates but seek ways to stabilize exchange rates. This is similar to the silver price problem in the past: the concern is not high prices but instability. The level of the exchange rate is merely a reflection of the purchasing power of the legal tender (fapi). Although it is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, it is not the root cause of the current public anxiety. We appreciate the past achievements of the national government in maintaining foreign exchange, and we also consider stabilizing exchange rates as an urgent priority. Stabilizing exchange rates even one day earlier can curb the outflow of capital and eliminate the panic in the financial market. The facts of the past two years are clear, and there is no need for further elaboration. Some commentators attribute the instability of the foreign exchange black market to the manipulation of speculators, but they do not realize that without resolving the issues of "North Banknotes" and "futures exchange," there can be no stability, even without speculation.

"North Banknotes" refers to banknotes issued in North China. At the beginning of this week, the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank in Shanghai refused to accept these banknotes. However, small amounts are still allowed to be exchanged for Shanghai banknotes to avoid greater losses for merchants and ordinary people. Based on the information we have received from Tianjin, stopping the use of these banknotes is unlikely to be effective. Although the Tianjin branch of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank have gradually reduced the acceptance of Shanghai remittances, limiting the daily total amount to 5,000 to 10,000, the fees are still extremely low, charging only one yuan per thousand as a handling fee, equivalent to the official exchange rate. The low fees are enticing, and the Tianjin banks are willing to do whatever it takes to get a slice of the pie. The amount of funds remitted to Shanghai accumulates to a considerable sum throughout the year, mostly used to purchase foreign exchange for arbitrage. Given these facts, the effect of Shanghai stopping the use of "North Banknotes" is limited. If Tianjin can restrict the remittance of "North Banknotes" to Shanghai, or outright refuse to accept Tianjin remittances, then the "North Banknote" problem in Shanghai can be easily resolved, and the foreign exchange market in Tianjin can also change its old ways. The constraints on the Shanghai foreign exchange black market can also be somewhat adjusted. This is one point.

The so-called "futures exchange" refers to the futures market in the foreign exchange black market. The origin of forward exchange rates is attributed to the theory of interest rate parity and the theory of purchasing power parity. Although these can have a regulatory effect on the market in normal times, they have become tools to damage finance today. In recent years, changes in exchange rates have been more sensitive in forward exchange rates, and spot rates are affected by this with every step. The importance of futures exchange is evident. Last winter, speculators heavily arbitraged between the spot and three-month forward markets in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government ordered the suspension of forward Shanghai remittances, and the exchange market stabilized. Then, why can't Shanghai follow the example of Hong Kong and quickly suspend the futures market in foreign exchange on the black market, reduce the activity of speculators, and alleviate the threat to spot foreign exchange? This is the second point.

In summary, although these may not be profound theories, addressing the issues of "North Banknotes" and "futures exchange" is a practical approach. These two issues are the main problems in the financial market today. Without resolving these issues, the foreign exchange market will be unstable, the panic in the market cannot be eliminated, and future disasters will continue to escalate.

### Finance: The Exchange Market is Unstable and Tense, the Trend of Contraction is Increasing, Japanese Merchants are Engaging in Fierce Grabbing Again, the Closing Price of British Gold is Four Shillings and a Half, the US Exchange Rate is 8.625 Yuan, the Tightening Continues After Market Close

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The initial announcement of HSBC's listed prices at 9:30 AM showed no changes. It was not until the second announcement at 9:50 AM that the British exchange rate was reduced by 25, the US exchange rate was listed at 9.4375, and other currencies also dropped uniformly. However, at 2:30 PM, the listed prices were removed. Due to the Japanese banks (reportedly settling military expenses) again engaging in grabbing in the informal market for British and US exchange rates, various import firms in Shanghai became alarmed and rushed to buy. Chinese merchants and speculators also secretly engaged in activities to grab the exchange rates, causing the tightening trend to erupt again, presenting a state of "having prices but no market." The situation was extremely chaotic, and everyone in the market was shocked and stunned. Initially, the opening price for British gold was 5 shillings and 0.03125, and the US exchange rate was 9.8125. HSBC was willing to supply slightly lower prices, and therefore foreign firms made some settlements. However, at 9:50 AM, HSBC's listed prices suddenly dropped sharply, with British gold at 4 shillings and 75, and the US exchange rate at 9.25. At these prices, HSBC was quite willing to discuss transactions. Additionally, Hong Kong sent a cable offering to sell, and the market stabilized immediately, fluctuating until noon, with the British exchange rate loosening to 4 shillings and 8.4375, and the US exchange rate also at 9.4375. In the afternoon, because HSBC had no intention of supplying, and under the unfavorable atmosphere, the grabbing trend rose again. HSBC removed the listed prices, only quoting the alarming and expensive prices of 4 shillings and a half for British gold and 8.75 yuan for US dollars (compared to the previous day, British gold tightened by half a shilling, and the US rate contracted by 9.375), making it extremely difficult to find sellers. As a result, the closing price for British gold reached 4 shillings and a half and the US exchange rate was 8.625 yuan. After the market closed, the trend continued to tighten, shrinking to an unprecedented record of 4 shillings and 25 for British gold and 8.25 yuan for US dollars. Futures were not considered at all due to the spot market conditions, and the tightening trend was similar. The transaction volume was very sparse, and the swap market disappeared invisibly. The transaction volume for spot goods was also very low throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, there was no market to speak of, and banks did not open, and the state of unease can be imagined.

HSBC's Listed Prices Show Another Contraction

The morning opening showed that the large and small London strips remained flat, the New York silver price was stable, London raw gold rebounded by half a shilling, the exchange rate for British against the US dropped by 1.5 cents, against Shanghai dropped by 3.75, against France remained unchanged. The US against British contracted by 0.0625, against Shanghai dropped by 0.26, and against France dropped by 1.25. The central bank's listed prices for each exchange rate remained the same. Banks' spot selling prices in the morning were 5 shillings and 0.03125 for British gold, and 9.8125 yuan for the US exchange rate, the same as the previous afternoon's closing prices. After opening, there were many foreign firms settling payments, but HSBC was only willing to maintain the listed price, and other foreign banks had no intention of selling, causing the market to tighten slightly. Foreign firms absorbed HSBC spot British gold at 5 shillings, and spot US dollars at 9.6875. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes, and the silver balance tax was still waived. After this, the grabbing intention of foreign firms became more intense, and Japanese banks also began to follow suit and grab fiercely. Additionally, Sassoon, a Western merchant, also aggressively absorbed from the futures market. However, HSBC, seeing this situation, stopped supplying at the listed price, making the market even tighter. At 9:50 AM, HSBC's second announcement of listed prices reduced British gold by 25 to 4 shillings and 75, and the US exchange rate was reduced by 4.375 to 9.25, and all other currencies were also uniformly contracted, creating a new unprecedented record. At this time, HSBC was still willing to maintain its second revised listed price, selling spot British gold at 4 shillings and 75, and spot US dollars at 9.25 to foreign firms and Japanese banks. Later, a sudden Hong Kong cable offered to sell, and other foreign banks also slightly sold, so the situation stabilized. Hong Kong Electric, East Asia and Macquarie Banks successively sold spot British gold at 4 shillings and 8.125 and 8.4375 and spot US dollars at 9.375 and 9.4375 to foreign firms and some banks. It was already noon, and it was difficult to get Hong Kong exchange rate quoted and had to be delayed to the noon closing. Banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 8.43275 for British gold and 9.4375 yuan for US dollars, compared to the morning opening, British rate tightened by 1.875, the US softened by 3.75.

In the Afternoon, it has Become a "Having Prices, No Market" Situation

In the afternoon, because there was no intention to supply after the market opened, and with the Hong Kong telegram stopping sales, and with various unfavorable atmospheres, Chinese silk and cotton merchants and foreign firms began to scramble, and the tightening wind became fierce again. It was also heard that HSBC had removed the listed price and did not see a subsequent listing, only quoting British gold at 4 shillings and a half, and the US rate at 8.75 yuan, but the position was very small, so the black market presented a situation of "having prices but no market" due to the disappearance of sellers. Until the late closing at 3 PM, banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and a half for British gold and 8.625 yuan for US dollars. As a result, compared to the afternoon closing of the previous day, British rate tightened further by 5.3125, and the US softened further by 1.1875 yuan. (It was heard that the dark market after the closing of the British market weakened to 4 shillings and 25, and the US continued to tighten to 8.25 yuan.) Finally, there was a slight recovery to 4 shillings and 375 for the British and 8.5 yuan for the US.

Tianjin British Exchange Rate Advances to Four Shillings

Tianjin, 20th Dispatch: The exchange market opened weakly today, tightening another 25 for British exchange rate, to 2 shillings 75 (according to yesterday, the lowest trading price for Tianjin British exchange rate had shrunk to 3 pence 8125), and contracted by 0.4375 for the US rate, to 7.3125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by five yuan, to 135 yuan. "Joint banknotes" on the dark market are more expensive by one yuan.

### Banknote Exchange – Overcrowded Beyond Belief

Since the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank started exchanging banknotes issued in North China, only ten yuan were allowed, one bill per person. If someone was discovered to be trying to exchange a second bill, they were turned away immediately. The exchangers were unusually crowded, and detectives were stationed to maintain order, queuing up in single file. According to one gentleman who went to the Bank of Communications on Avenue Joffre yesterday, from the time he joined the queue to the time he exchanged ten one-yuan bills, it took twenty-five minutes, which was considered relatively quick. Another gentleman went to the Bank of Communications at the intersection of Route Haug and attempted to exchange ten yuan. The crowd was so dense that it stretched from the bank entrance through Jing'an Temple Road, Yu Yuan Road, and Jiaozhou Road, end to end. After standing in line for two hours without being able to exchange, he returned dejectedly. It is now unimaginable that in this era of prevalent paper money, we are seeing a resurgence of the crowding and rushing to exchange banknotes (for silver dollars) of yesteryear.

### Eliminating Discounting of Drafts

— Yu Zhen

Remittance drafts were originally cashed the next day, with value equal to cash. After the Shanghai Incident of 1937 (year 26 of the Republic), following the Ministry of Finance's announcement of measures to stabilize finance, silver firms, in order to facilitate the capital activities of industry and commerce and increase their funds, requested and received approval from the Ministry of Finance to supplement the measures. This stipulated that remittance drafts should only be remitted to other firms and should not be used for cash payment or purchasing foreign exchange. Therefore, remittance drafts after August 13th (8/13 Incident) were actually legal tender (fapi) deposits. Over time, due to the widespread use of legal tender and restrictions imposed by the financial stability measures, it was not easy for general depositors to obtain cash, so they began to pay a discount fee to convert the remittance drafts into legal tender. In 1938, the highest discount rate reached 79 yuan. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank then intervened through the Bankers' Association to stabilize the price at around 50 yuan by adjusting funds between firms. After the Ministry of Finance announced new restrictions on withdrawals in Shanghai on June 23rd this year, the discount suddenly rose sharply, reaching a reported but untraded price of 200 yuan. Formal transactions began on the 23rd, with prices between 120 and 130 yuan. Because of rumors that new remittance draft rules would be implemented starting July 4th, the closing price on June 30th dropped to 72.5 yuan. When silver firms opened for business on July 4th and the new remittance draft rules were implemented, it only affected the internal operations of silver firms. Foreign banks still did not accept them, so the discount actually increased by 20 yuan, with prices in the 90s of yuan. As of the 14th, it stayed between 95 and 100 yuan. On the 15th, due to strong demand, the price reached 106 yuan. On the 17th, it rose to 109 yuan. On the 18th, because Hong Kong no longer supplied foreign exchange at 6 shillings and 5625, the foreign exchange market and gold were rising, and the demand for banknotes increased, so the discount rose to 137.5 yuan. On the 19th, the price reached as high as 165 yuan. On the 20th (yesterday), because cash skyrocketed and foreign exchange contracted again, the demand for banknotes was even greater, and the discount had risen to 200 yuan. One yuan of remittance draft was only worth 83 cents of legal tender. There has been no news of the three banks intervening to maintain the price. Currently, remittance drafts require collateral to be obtained from the bank's reserve. If the price continues to fall, it may harm the entire Shanghai financial system. In my humble opinion, remittance drafts should not be allowed to be discounted, and legal tender should be supplied to meet the legitimate needs of industry and commerce. The exchange should strictly limit the amount of remittance drafts that firms can obtain later, and implement tightening measures. Silver firms should also refuse requests from general depositors without legitimate purposes to pay out the remittance drafts in one go. In this way, the illegitimate transactions of discounting may gradually be eliminated.

The Frenzied Purchase Reaches Boiling Point

Since this morning, initially securities brokers and money changers had strong buying intentions for gold bars (ten taels per bar), bidding as high as 3,220-3,230 yuan. However, sellers remained passive. Suddenly, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had softened, and the buying increased, with everyone rushing to bid, raising the price significantly and it opened at 3,300 yuan. A securities broker absorbed 50 taels from a certain silver firm. Then, the silver firm continued to dump, coupled with a certain gold shop competing to release its stock on behalf of speculators, causing the price to drop by 60 yuan. A money changer sold 20 taels to a cash firm, with the price of 240 yuan being the lowest for the day. A certain money changer then began to aggressively buy, and the supply from sellers decreased, immediately pushing the price back up, and breaking through the 3,300 yuan mark. A certain money changer bought 50 taels from a fellow firm, with the price being 320 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that HSBC's second listed prices were announced, uniformly contracting, which strengthened people's conviction, and sellers became more reluctant to part with their gold, expanding the rising trend. A certain money changer continued to aggressively purchase more than 300 taels, and another money changer also aggressively bought over 100 taels. The price was pushed up by 110 yuan, breaking through the 3,400 yuan mark. A certain money changer bought 50 taels from a securities broker, with the price being 430 yuan. Most of the gold was supplied by a certain gold shop (on behalf of speculators) and jewelry shops. There were many limited price sales, so retail investors and jewelry shops rushed to sell, immediately dropping the price by 35 yuan. A cash firm sold 50 taels to a certain jewelry shop, with the price being 395 yuan. Later, a foreign bank entrusted a certain silver firm to absorb over 200 taels, and a certain gold shop on behalf of speculators also bought more than it sold, restarting the rising trend, leaping another 85 yuan. A certain gold shop (on behalf of speculators) bought 50 taels from a money changer, reaching an astonishing peak of 3,480 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that Hong Kong was selling foreign exchange, so the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the gold price also dropped by 30 yuan. A certain money changer sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop, with 450 yuan being the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the buying became more intense, and the market opened 50 yuan higher, with money changers trading 50 taels among themselves, with the price being 500 yuan. A certain money changer then aggressively bought over 100 taels, pushing the price up to 550 yuan. Later, because cash firms slightly sold, the price once dropped to 525 yuan. Rumors then arose in the market, coupled with news that foreign exchange was tightening sharply due to lack of support. General speculators became agitated and wildly bought and indiscriminately purchased. Jewelry shops also aggressively bought on behalf of wealthy individuals. Although a certain silver firm released its stock on behalf of a foreign bank, the amount was insufficient to quench the thirst and suppress the momentum. The price then broke through multiple hundred-yuan marks from 3,600 yuan to 900 yuan and 4,000 yuan, and the rising trend was rare. Later, a certain gold shop also aggressively purchased on behalf of its customers, and the jewelry shops also continued to buy, pushing the price higher. As a result, the closing price reached 3,955 yuan, an unprecedented record, an increase of 755 yuan compared to yesterday. It has now risen consecutively for three days, totaling an increase of 1,336 yuan, with a difference of 675 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash firm's gold bars was 10 yuan higher than the spot price. The spot price was around 50 yuan lower than the listed price.

Ornamental Gold Suspends High at 400 Yuan

The exchange rate for gold jewelry in jewelry stores did not initially change. Until 9:45 AM, it was raised by 10 yuan, then raised by another 5 yuan at 9:50 AM, another 5 yuan at 10:05 AM, another 5 yuan at 11:36 AM, another 5 yuan at 2:00 PM, another 5 yuan at 2:10 PM, another 5 yuan at 3:00 PM, sharply increased by 15 yuan at 3:05 PM, another 5 yuan at 3:15 PM, and jumped by 10 yuan at 3:35 PM, and then increased by another 5 yuan at 3:50 PM, totaling an increase of 75 yuan. There was no decline in between. The Dah Tong firm has raised its gold price to 400 yuan, and the Xin Tong firm to 398 yuan. There was no fixed price for buying, which has created a new peak since the market began.

Pure Gold Returns by Half a Penny

London, 19th Dispatch: The price of English pure gold returned by half a penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pennies, so the buying price of Chinese cash at the central bank also returned to 1,212.3 yuan.

### Startled at the Mention of Tigers – Gold Knocks on the Door of 4,000 Yuan Mark – Rising for Three Consecutive Days…1,336 Yuan – Within a Single Day…Rising 755 Yuan

Yesterday's spot market situation for gold bars, following consecutive days of skyrocketing and soaring indefinitely, created a shocking record for the gold market. Those who heard about it were startled. The reasons for this are nothing more than the prevalence of rumors in the market, but everyone has different opinions. Here are a few points: (1) It is widely rumored that the British attitude is trending towards softening, and the Tianjin Incident has been left to the Japanese; (2) Rumors of the resignation of certain officials in China have resurfaced in the market. There are countless other baseless rumors, but none are worth a knowledgeable person's consideration. The market immediately jumped 100 yuan higher in the morning, opening at 3,300 yuan. Later, as money changers released their stock on behalf of foreign banks to make a profit, the price once dropped to 3,280 yuan. However, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate continued to contract, so the buyers rallied again, causing the price to skyrocket to a high of 3,480 yuan. Near noon, the arrival of Hong Kong telegrams selling foreign exchange stabilized the foreign exchange market, and the gold price also dropped to a closing price of 3,450 yuan. In the afternoon, the rumors mentioned above suddenly arose, and it was further rumored that the supply of foreign exchange was about to be suspended, and people became more confused. The fervor of wealthy merchants and businessmen buying gold had reached a boiling point. They bought whatever was available and aimed for 4,000 yuan. As a result, the market became turbulent, and the closing price jumped to 3,955 yuan, only 45 yuan away from 4,000. Transactions were very active, with a total volume of around 4,000 taels for the day. Jewelry stores also raised their gold prices eleven times in a row, for a total increase of 75 yuan, creating a record high of 400 yuan. Customs gold remained flat, and British and Chinese pure gold both rose again.

### 1,000 Yuan in Remittance Drafts - Exchanged at an 80% Rate

Yesterday's discount rate for remittance drafts, due to the increasingly widespread use of cash, caused the rate per 1,000 yuan to rise from 170 yuan in the morning to as high as 200 yuan. It only slightly decreased in the afternoon, with a rate of 190 yuan, which was 35 yuan higher than the previous day. The money market's interest rate remained unchanged, with both morning and afternoon markets listing 0.16.

### British and American Gold Coins - Jumped by Seventeen or Eighteen Yuan

Yesterday, the price of pure English gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies decreased by 0.0625. Foreign exchange in the local port, foreign banks and Japanese banks speculators were all absorbing, and the supply from foreign banks could not keep up. The HSBC listed price was contracted, and the market was weak, and violent fluctuations occurred throughout the day. The evening closing price for English exchange was 4 shillings and 375, shrinking by 6525 compared to the previous day, and the American exchange rate was 8.625 yuan, a dramatic drop of 1.1875 yuan. The price of gold bars was high at the opening because the remittance draft market was unusually tight, and people's minds were disturbed. The high price of 3,300 yuan was made, and customers, cash firms, etc., absorbed it very smoothly, and the changes became more and more intense. The noon closing was 450 yuan. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was even higher, and the opening price was 3,500 yuan. It was heard that remittance drafts were even tighter, and people's hearts were in a state of panic, with a sense of insecurity and a lack of security. The speculators manipulated it, and the wealthy people viewed the legal currency as a worn rag, and the funds were exhausted, and the market price soared. The evening closing price was 3,955 yuan, a sharp increase of 755 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the sharp drop in the value of paper money, the sharp rise in the price of gold was affected, and the gold price soared unanimously. There was no supply in the market, only the sporadic sales of foreign soldiers and Jewish refugees. There were few public transactions. Shixiang sold the Longchang Jin American dollar bill for 300 yuan. Yesterday's market prices, the price of British gold rose by 18 yuan, the price of British gold ticket rose by 8 yuan and 80 cents, the price of American gold rose by 17.5 yuan, the price of American surplus tickets rose by 3.2 yuan, the price of Hong Kong tickets rose by 45 cents, the price of French franc tickets rose by 34 cents, the price of Singapore tickets rose by 55 cents, the price of Dutch tickets rose by 40 cents, the price of Annam tickets rose by 30 cents, the price of Roby tickets rose by 35 cents, the price of Canadian tickets rose by 1.8 yuan, the price of Philippine tickets rose by 1.1 yuan, the price of Italian tickets rose by 30 cents, the price of German gold tickets rose by 50 cents, the price of Australian gold tickets rose by 3.5 yuan, the price of Swiss tickets rose by 50 cents, and the price of Japanese gold tickets rose along with it, 1 yuan and 11 cents in the evening market, and the price of Korean tickets was 88 cents.

### Securities: The Mystery of Principal and Interest Unveiled; Public Bonds Plunge

The securities gray market saw another alarming drop yesterday, triggered by a telegram from Chongqing announcing the suspension of principal and interest payments. This officially revealed the mystery and surpassed the sharp price drop on June 22nd due to the Chongqing telegram, hitting a new low. Class A bonds plummeted by over seven yuan. In reality, what the spokesperson said was merely a rehash of old news. This newspaper has repeatedly elaborated on this matter. The so-called suspension of principal and interest is intended for external purposes, in order to maintain uniformity. Therefore, banks were separately instructed to offer discounting services. If discounting is available, bondholders can still receive principal and interest, albeit with a loss of interest. It is reported that many short sellers in the market borrowed heavily from relatives and friends to deliver, and even students were heavily shorting. Their sole goal was to await the emergence of large institutional bulls, repeatedly spreading rumors. In reality, the large bulls had already distributed their holdings. If they were to cover their short positions, the rebound would be astonishing. Yesterday's trading saw an initial sharp drop of two or three yuan due to selling by Yuan Da and No. 16 companies. Songmao acted on behalf of a major institutional investor to sell, and No. 35 and Lianyi also sold on behalf of clients, pushing the market price down another two or three yuan. Later, Dian Yuan, Tiansheng, Tongshun, Hengfu, and general retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, allowing prices to recover by varying amounts of one, two, or three yuan. The market stabilized considerably after the close. Ultimately, prices fell by two yuan six and a half cents to four yuan and a half cents compared to the previous day. The total turnover was estimated at over 1.1 million yuan. A summary table is provided below.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Industry Is Dazed and Manic; Treated Like Foreign Exchange; Double Horse Yarn Jumps 20 Yuan; Spot Transactions Decrease Instead

The yarn market continues to rise, with the upward trend intensifying. The continuous shrinking of foreign exchange rates, coupled with soaring gold prices, has dragged the yarn market into a vortex. Generally, cotton yarn is treated like cash and foreign exchange. The prevailing mentality is to correlate changes in foreign exchange rates to the yarn market, thus expanding the range of yarn price fluctuations. As for actual transactions by trading houses, amidst this crazy and distorted situation, the upward trend is so drastic that they are dazed and confused, unsure of where to start, with no standard to follow. Consequently, spot yarn transactions have decreased significantly, and the situation appears passive instead. After the close, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was pushed to 545 yuan, and those holding the goods were still unwilling to sell. From a psychological perspective, the market is bullish, but this situation is excessively heated.

Current Yarn Market Conditions: At the opening of the market this morning, traders gathered and unanimously expected prices to rise. Prices remained firm, with opening prices increasing by 5 yuan. The selling price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for foreign godowns was 526 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 519 yuan. The situation was still calm at this time. Shortly afterward, buyers surged again, and the market price tightened further, because although gold prices were high, the high discounting rate for banknotes somewhat evened things out. By 11 o'clock, the market situation suddenly changed, and buyers swarmed in, claiming that the shrinking trend of the British exchange rate had started again, breaking through 5 pence, and gold prices had reached a new high. Therefore, the selling price jumped 10 yuan in an instant, but there were very few sellers. The closing price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for foreign godowns was 540 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 530 yuan. It is estimated that less than 1,000 bales were traded in half a day, with fellow traders accounting for 665 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 20 yuan, and Shepherd rose by 7.5 yuan. The quantities purchased by various trading houses are listed on the left: Hong Kong: 280 bales; Fellow Traders: 665 bales; Mainland: 50 bales; Total: 995 bales.

The Japanese yarn market has also risen, but actual demand is scarce due to the financial tightening. However, in anticipation of the shrinking exchange rate for next month's goods, speculative buyers have flocked in, pushing up market prices. The current asking price for 20-count Yueqin yarn is 417 yuan, a rise of 3 or 4 yuan.

Banknote Funds Are Dwindling; Cotton Merchants Are Settling Prices for Forward Contracts; Only Three Transactions in Foreign Cotton

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was weak in the morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported declines. There was significant hedging selling in the South, and there was no improvement in the middle of the day. In the third session, trading among traders increased, and there was also a lot of short covering. As a result, the market price rebounded by 10 points, resulting in the highest closing price. The closing price in India fell by one rupee, but the forecast was for a rise of over two rupees, offsetting the fall and still resulting in a rise of one and a half rupees. The price in Egypt fell by 5 points.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: No new transactions have been reported for several weeks. Since the sharp contraction in exchange rates on Tuesday, wealthy individuals have rushed to purchase foreign exchange, resulting in large sums of banknotes being transferred to banks on the Bund. At the same time, the demand for banknotes has increased daily, while the funds available have dwindled, causing the discounting rate to rise sharply and leading to increasing financial difficulties. Aware of this situation, traders who had previously placed orders, fearing that they would have difficulty raising funds when the goods arrived, and considering that they could still make a substantial profit before the goods were shipped, settled prices with foreign firms, which was the best policy.

Another report: Transactions in native cotton have ceased again. In general, the chaotic situation has made negotiations difficult, and the parties have been unable to reach an agreement. However, Indian cotton traders still conducted two trades, with prices increasing by 3 yuan. Hong Tong Factory purchased 130 bales of 32-count to 40-count Brazilian cotton for 140 yuan, which was the factory-delivered price including exchange costs. Other manufacturers showed little activity. Due to the storms and two hurricanes in Northern Jiangsu yesterday, shipping was suspended, so no goods arrived in Shanghai. The current situation of spot cotton is as follows: Hwui Si Teng: 110.00; Middle traders: 200 bales; Banknote settlement Brazilian cotton: 140.00; Also 130 bales; Exchange plus Bailuo to: 100.00; Also 100 bales; Banknote plus.

### Piece Goods: Public Sentiment Is Volatile; General Public Is Stockpiling Cotton Cloth Again

Native Cloth

Yesterday, foreign exchange rates contracted again, and discounting rates rose sharply. Public sentiment in the market was volatile, and the atmosphere of stockpiling spot goods in the hope of mitigating currency devaluation became increasingly prevalent. Native cloth transactions still typically use exchange rates for pricing. With the discounting rate currently soaring to 200 yuan, native cloth is now generally cheaper than Dongye cloth. Therefore, it has aroused the interest of general stockpilers, and stockpiling has become enthusiastic again. Spot demand has also rebounded. The asking price for coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill has increased by 5 cents to 20 cents per piece. Colored cloth, colored twill, printed and dyed goods have all seen increases in raw material and bleaching costs, and asking prices have also increased by 10 cents to 25 cents per piece. British merchants' spot prices for various goods remain unchanged. Sales to stockpilers are the strongest, with an estimated 200+ bales of fine twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth sold, as well as 100+ cases of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, woolen fabric, and printed flannel. Dyeing factories purchased 200+ bales of grey cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang traders purchased 100+ bales of fine twill, and 100+ cases of colored cloth and colored twill. 2000+ pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached goods were sold. Sichuan and Yunnan traders purchased 100+ bales of blue cloth, colored twill, printed goods, and woolen fabric.

Dongye Cloth

The market for white cloth has continued to be robust due to trading between insiders and outsiders. Fine cloth and fine materials have trended upward again. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is currently priced at 14 yuan 40 cents for spot goods and 14 yuan 60 cents for forward contracts. In the afternoon, actual sales of grey cloth also started, further bolstering the market momentum. Although the spot discounting rate is rising to around 200 yuan, spot and forward orders for fine cloth and fine twill still amounted to an estimated 1,000 pieces throughout the day.

### Oil Cakes: Oil Is Extremely Expensive

Raw Oil: Hong Kong is actively procuring supplies, and with gold prices rising steadily, the market has been strongly encouraged and prices have surged again, rising by 50 cents to 1.67 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Japanese Side Madly Scrambling Again; Black Market Foreign Exchange Tightens Again; Gold Prices Soar Near the 4,000 Yuan Mark; Small Denomination Banknotes with Place Names in North China Are Still Accepted for Redemption; Speculators May Face Dire Losses

After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee restricted the supply of foreign exchange to prevent arbitrage, the Japanese bank's scrambling caused the black market exchange rate to contract again. Due to speculators' manipulation, gold prices have soared to new records. The discount on exchange rates has risen to a staggering 200 yuan. The entire Chinese financial system has been affected. The details are recorded as follows.

### Exchange Market Received Another Shock Yesterday

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury*, the exchange market in Shanghai received another shock this morning (20th). The market opened at yesterday's (19th) closing rate, but the demand for foreign exchange from various buyers was very strong, while the supply from exporters and speculators was quite limited. As a result, the exchange rate continued to fall. At around 10 a.m., the telegraphic transfer rate for U.S. dollars was 9.6875 yuan, but it shrank to 9.25 yuan at noon. The telegraphic transfer rate for British pounds also fell from 5 and 1/4 pence to 4 and 3/4 pence within two hours, meaning that 10.81 yuan in legal tender was needed to exchange for one U.S. dollar, and 50.50 yuan in legal tender was equivalent to one British pound. The exchange rate for U.S. dollars in exchange shops once rose as high as 11 yuan in legal tender to exchange for one U.S. dollar.

### All Parties Are Concerned About the Natural Level

Neither Hong Kong nor Chongqing has issued any news regarding the intentions of the central government or the Equalization Fund, so the market remains completely unaware of what will happen. The question of greatest concern to the public is what exchange rate the Equalization Fund will recognize as the new natural level of legal tender, and how it will resume selling foreign exchange, as well as the circumstances under which foreign exchange will be sold in the future. From the perspective of China's legal tender reserve, the current exchange rate in Shanghai seems to be indeed devaluing the value of legal tender.

### Foreign Exchange Reserves Are Exceptionally Ample

At the beginning of this month, the total amount of currency in circulation issued by the central government's banks was 200 billion yuan. According to reliable sources, its foreign exchange reserve is equivalent to 20 million pounds sterling based on its parity to this circulating currency amount. At the current exchange rate, these 20 million pounds are sufficient to cover foreign exchange and parity requirements, reaching about 15% of the total value of legal tender. This figure further convinces people that the Shanghai market seems to be under heavy pressure from foreign exchange buyers. Speculators may suffer significant losses if they rashly purchase foreign exchange.

### "Hongkou Currency" Finally Collapses

As for the "Hongkou currency," the Chinese side has finally achieved its goal. This morning, the Huaxing Bank has ceased to follow the legal tender exchange rate for the Huaxing currency and has set a rate of six pence, which is one-quarter higher than the legal tender. Therefore, the "Hongkou currency" has superficially abandoned its parity with the legal tender. However, the Shanghai public has no intention of exchanging "Hongkou currency" at a discount to legal tender. The Japanese yen rose sharply for the first time this morning amidst the current devaluation of legal tender. Its market price was 1.04 yuan in legal tender for buying and 1.035 yuan for selling. Ten-ounce gold bars rose to an even higher level again this morning, opening at 3,300 yuan and closing at 3,450 yuan in the black market at noon, the highest price seen in many years.

Japanese Side Madly Scrambling Again

After the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, the foreign exchange market gradually stabilized because the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) continued to supply as much foreign exchange as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries. Yesterday morning, HSBC quoted British pounds at 5 pence and U.S. dollars at 9.6875 yuan, the same as the previous day's quoted prices. Later, the Japanese bank started scrambling again, causing the market to become tense again. At 9:50 a.m., HSBC lowered its quoted prices, with British pounds at 4.75 pence and U.S. dollars at 9.25 yuan. As a result, public sentiment was volatile and the market became chaotic again. Subsequently, Hong Kong allowed for supply and sale, and public sentiment became more stable and the market price gradually eased.

French Exchange Rate Stabilized

The Ministry of Finance continues to maintain its original policy for statutory foreign exchange rates. Therefore, yesterday's statutory foreign exchange rates at the Central Bank were 1 shilling 2 and a half pence for British pounds and 30 U.S. dollars. As for the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's decision to restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, the intention is to prevent certain parties from engaging in speculative arbitrage. Therefore, the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market has no impact on the overall currency credit. At the same time, the national financial system remains stable, and the foundation of various banks is becoming increasingly solid. Moreover, unlimited supply of foreign exchange to regions that are beyond the reach of wartime political power is detrimental rather than beneficial to the war of resistance.

Prevent Speculative Arbitrage

For the import of non-prohibited goods, applying to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase statutory foreign exchange proves that the Chinese government still supplies foreign exchange at the statutory price for legitimate needs, and does not change its policy due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market. As for the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's policy towards foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, it is not that it is not supplied at all, but that it is restricted to prevent certain parties from engaging in speculative arbitrage. Therefore, British HSBC and other banks still supply as much foreign exchange as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries, but purchases must be made with a purchase order. The restrictions on swaps are intended to eliminate the manipulation of speculators.

Redemption of Small Denomination Banknotes

Regarding the issue of banknotes with place names in North China (Tianjin), the reporter from *New Voice* learned from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications yesterday that their branch offices, in addition to telegraphing their head offices for instructions, have already consulted and reached a proper solution. Today, they have decided to redeem these banknotes at face value, but in order to prevent large-scale transfers to Shanghai to arbitrage foreign exchange, they have to impose appropriate restrictions on large amounts. Today, the Shanghai branch offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are redeeming small amounts of banknotes as much as possible, which proves that these banknotes are still valid. It has now been decided to continue redemption, and it is hoped that all sectors will not refuse to accept banknotes from Zhejiang Xingye, China Industrial, Communications, Ningbo Commercial, Agricultural Commercial, Agricultural and Industrial, and Zhejiang localities.

Gold Prices Soar

After the black market for cash soared due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, reaching new records, speculators rushed to buy gold. Yesterday, the black market closed at an astonishing 3,955 yuan, an unprecedented level in history. Major silver shops changed their listed prices in the afternoon, with major shops listing 400 yuan and new shops listing 398 yuan. General observations suggest that due to the manipulation of speculators, the cash price may break through the 4,000 yuan mark. In addition, the discount on exchange rates continued to soar due to the need for cash among speculators who requested discounts from small money shops using exchange rate bills. Yesterday, it rose to a staggering 200 yuan.

Silver Industry Regular Meeting

The Shanghai Banking Association held a regular meeting of its Executive Committee at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Wu Yunji, Ye Fuxiao, Lin Kanghou, Pan Jiufen, and others attended. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunzhai and recorded by Gu Chengan. In addition to reporting on the association's activities for the week, the meeting adjourned at 2:30 p.m. According to the association's secretary, speaking to the *New Voice* reporter, there were no proposals at yesterday's Executive Committee meeting. Rumors that the association discussed: The sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market; The redemption of banknotes with place names in Tianjin; were not true, because the association had no need to discuss the above two issues.

Financial Stability

The *New Voice* reporter learned from the silver and money industry yesterday that since the Ministry of Finance restricted withdrawals and deposits, the run on banks has subsided, rumors have disappeared, and public sentiment has stabilized. The new remittance system of the Bank Association's Joint Reserve Committee, which took effect on July 4th, has been quite effective. The market has suddenly become flexible, and various industries have indirectly and directly benefited greatly. The various interest rates of the silver and money industry remain unchanged. The four-bank discount committee of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank continues to do its utmost to regulate the financial affairs of the industry. Therefore, the financial market remains stable as always. The soaring cash prices, falling securities prices, and sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market are all caused by the manipulation of speculative elements.

### Japan Claims British Troops Wounded Workers; All Utter Nonsense; British Side Thoroughly Investigated and Found No Such Thing; Japan Even Considers It Intentional Insult

According to *North-China Daily News*, a Japanese news agency reported that since the British military authorities refused to acknowledge that a sentry from the Eastern Surrey Regiment stabbed a Chinese railway worker on Sunday morning, the Central China Railway Company has threatened to refuse to provide convenience to the British and British goods. The reporter asked an official at the British Consulate yesterday (19th) about this matter, who said that the British military authorities had conducted a thorough investigation and found no stabbing incident. The Japanese news agency also said that the Railway Company claimed that the British military authorities' refusal to acknowledge the incident was "intentional insult," while British Major Ashmore called the Japanese side's accusation "utter nonsense." According to Inoue, Deputy Director of the Business Department of the Central China Railway Company, the company believes that the railways are the transportation lifeline for building a new China, providing rapid and safe transportation to Chinese, Japanese, and third-country nationals and their goods. Therefore, the company believes that the unjustified injury of a worker is most regrettable. This kind of action is actually hindering the duties of those engaged in building a new order in East Asia. The Central China Railway Company has the intention of making a request through established channels, and the attitude taken by the British authorities will determine what steps will be taken. If it is discovered that the British intend to be hostile to the establishment of peace and order in Central China, the company may be forced to refuse to transport the British and British goods. It is reported that the Japanese side has not lodged a protest with the British military or consular authorities yesterday. An official at the British Consulate said that if such a protest arrives, we will take appropriate steps.

### Securities Gray Market Plunges Yesterday; But the Four Banks, for the Sake of Stabilizing the Market, Will Allow Discounting and Collateralized Lending Starting from the End of July

Since the Ministry of Finance issued a notice on January 15th stipulating the method of paying off domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties after the interception of customs duties, it was unavoidable to temporarily suspend the payment of principal and interest due on the seventh installment of the 1926 National Unification Public Bonds due on July 31st. However, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank, for the sake of stabilizing the market, will allow the discounting and collateralized lending of principal and interest coupons. The four banks will issue "discount certificates," which will be processed starting from the end of July. The Shanghai Securities Gray Market was triggered yesterday morning by a telegram from the Chongqing Ministry of Finance spokesperson stating that the National Unification Public Bonds were suspending principal and interest payments. General retail investors became panicked, and selling pressure suddenly intensified, causing prices to fall. The closing prices are recorded below: National Unification Class A: 52.80 yuan, down 9.60 yuan; Class B: 44.40 yuan, down 3.05 yuan; Class C: 43.05 yuan, down 3.40 yuan; Class D: 42.00 yuan, down 3.90 yuan; Class E: 43.35 yuan, down 2.65 yuan.

### Hurricane Sweeps Through Western Shanghai, Fortunately Not a Direct Hit; Wind Force Diminishes After Landfall; Surprising Rapid Change in Wind Direction; Significant Tidal Surge in the Huangpu River Floods Roads

The Xujiahui Observatory reported at 6:00 AM yesterday that after making landfall in Hangzhou Bay, the hurricane had advanced to 119 degrees east longitude and 30 degrees north latitude, heading north-northwest. The wind force had gradually diminished after landfall. Shanghai was not directly hit by the hurricane, which passed near Hangzhou, west of Shanghai. However, due to the influence of the hurricane, the weather changed abruptly, with showers and strong winds. The Jianghai Customs and the signal tower on Lan Road had displayed two red lights, representing two black balls, from the night before, warning ships not to enter or leave the port.

Black Ball Lowered, Navigation Resumes

After the hurricane passed west of Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs and Lan Road signal tower hoisted one black ball yesterday morning, warning ships to remain on alert. By 2:00 PM yesterday, the black ball was lowered, and ships in the Huangpu River fully resumed navigation. Vessels from the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Northern and Southern routes, as well as ships on the lower Yangtze River, all entered and left the Huangpu River as usual. Fortunately, Shanghai was not directly hit; otherwise, the high tide in the Huangpu River yesterday morning would have caused significant losses to the city. However, some warehouses were flooded, causing minor water damage to a small amount of goods.

To Dissipate Between Nanjing and Wuhu
The Xujiahui Observatory reported at 6:00 PM yesterday that the hurricane had advanced to 118.40 degrees east longitude and 31 degrees north latitude, heading west-northwest, and was expected to dissipate between Nanjing and Wuhu. The wind force had diminished to level four to five, and it might dissipate there. The Hangzhou Bay area in Zhejiang, as well as areas near Hangzhou, were hit by the hurricane, resulting in substantial local losses.

Huangpu River High Tide Almost Reaches the Bank

Due to repeated strikes by the hurricane, the tide level of the Huangpu River was also significantly raised. The high tide at 3:15 AM today measured a significant 11 feet 2 inches. The high tide at 4:00 PM this afternoon was 9 feet 6 inches. The high tide at 4:02 AM tomorrow (the 22nd) is expected to be 11 feet, and the high tide at 4:55 PM tomorrow is expected to be 9 feet 4.4 inches. The height of the Bund embankment is 13 feet, so the high tide is very close to the bank.

Low-Lying Roads Become a Vast Expanse of Water

After a period of storms and rain, lower-lying areas such as Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Fuzhou Road, Nanjing Road, Yinhua Street, Zhejiang Road, Guizhou Road, Guangxi Road, Avenue Edward VII, Xinzha Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, Ximen Road, Route Cardinal Mercier, Avenue Foch, and Route Paul Henry Vignon, were flooded due to the rainwater not draining in time and the backflow of the Huangpu River's high tide, turning them into watery expanses. This was especially severe in western Shanghai and had not receded completely last night.

Outbound Sea Shipping is Hampered

The two black balls on the Jianghai Customs clock tower were removed yesterday, and the hurricane warning was lifted. However, the southeast wind remained strong, and the waves in the Huangpu River were still turbulent, preventing a full resumption of shipping. The situation of various ships yesterday is recorded below. The Shandong ship from Qingdao only entered the port around 5:00 PM. The British Sudan, returning to Shanghai from Tianjin, and the Blue Funnel Line's Antenor, arriving in Shanghai from Liverpool, had not reported entering the port to the customs by 6:00 PM. However, the company stated that they had not received any delayed telegrams and expected them to arrive in Shanghai last night or this morning. The Sudan was originally scheduled to depart for Europe today, but due to the delay, the return trip to Europe would also be postponed by one day. Ships traveling on the lower Yangtze River had not arrived in port by 8:00 PM yesterday. Only the Japanese Da Hua ship returned to Shanghai from Xin Gang at 5:10 PM yesterday and docked at the Bund No. 3 wharf. Ships returning to Shanghai last night are expected to depart as usual this morning. If they could not return to Shanghai last night, there will be no ships for export today. Jardine Matheson's Tung Wah ship could not return to Shanghai yesterday due to the storm and is now scheduled to enter the port tomorrow. The Ewo ship, originally scheduled to depart for Beisha yesterday morning, is sheltering from the storm in Shanghai and is now scheduled to depart tomorrow morning. The French Messageries Maritimes' General Joffre, arriving in Shanghai from Marseille, was not affected by the hurricane and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 5:00 PM this afternoon as scheduled, docking at the Hongkou Gonghexing wharf. The connecting ferry carrying passengers will disembark at the New Customs wharf around 6:00 PM this afternoon. The American President Lines' President Coolidge departed at 5:40 PM yesterday afternoon for Hong Kong and Luzon. Jardine Matheson's Fu Sheng also departed for Hong Kong yesterday morning. The Taikoo Jinan and Jardine Matheson's Kuei Sheng were scheduled to depart yesterday according to the schedule, but due to the hurricane report in Kobe, Japan, passengers and cargo could not be loaded as scheduled, so they were rescheduled to depart today. The Shanghai-Ningbo route's De Ping and Hana were originally scheduled to depart this morning, but were also delayed by one day due to the hurricane and the failure to load passengers and cargo. Passengers traveling on these two ships must board the ship tonight. It is also reported that the Moufu ship sailed to Jintang Island to shelter from the storm the night before due to the large storm surge outside Zhenhai. Yesterday afternoon, it had sailed back to the outer blockade line and is expected to return to Shanghai from Zhenhai with miscellaneous cargo on the 23rd.

The Fate of An Li Passengers is Uncertain

The Swedish Ruifeng Foreign Company's Xin An Li steamer departed from Shanghai for Dinghai on the 6th of this month, but was stopped by a Japanese warship in the Daishan waters. The compradore Kuan Chunsun and four crew members were detained for several days. After negotiations between the company and the headquarters of the Japanese Third Fleet, permission to resume navigation was granted. Therefore, a Tong was released on the 16th and hired three Hengfeng tugboats to tow three sailing boats, carrying more than 100 passengers and a large amount of local produce, to Shanghai. On the 18th, the tug arrived in the Tongsha waters. Due to the hurricane, the ship cables broke, and one sailing boat, carrying Tong and more than 30 passengers, drifted away and their fate is unknown. The remaining passengers and crew arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM the night before. It is reported that the company is now seeking assistance from all parties to search for the missing crew members and sailing boat.

Part of the Japanese Telegraph Line is Interrupted

According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post", the wind force of this hurricane shifted north, but its speed of movement was quite surprising. The hurricane has already traveled a long distance over land and may have lost much of its intensity. Therefore, Nanjing should not be as severely affected as coastal towns. According to Japanese newspapers, the tail of the hurricane broke part of the Japanese government's telegraph line between Shanghai and Nagasaki, and telephone services between Nanjing and Shanghai were also interrupted due to the strong winds. Japan-China Airlines flights were all ordered to be suspended yesterday (the 19th). There were no reports of damage to any airports.

### Affected by Foreign Exchange and the Hurricane, Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday; Reduced Rice Reserves Are a Natural Phenomenon; Trend Remains Stable in the Absence of Special Circumstances

After the Concession authorities stipulated a maximum price for domestic rice from the 17th of this month, with the highest grade of white japonica rice not exceeding 20 yuan and the highest grade of Kehsien rice not exceeding 16 yuan, all domestic rice was traded below the price limit. Starting yesterday, due to the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange, the quoted price of foreign rice increased, and grain merchants have stopped ordering. At the same time, due to the hurricane, it is feared that the early rice crops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces will be affected, causing rice merchants to refuse to sell, and prices are expected to rise. As a result, the price of all rice in the market increased by 20 to 30 cents, and the genuine top-grade white japonica rice and Kehsien rice are not being sold in the market.

The Guild Announces the Total Amount of Rice Reserves

The Bean and Rice Industry Guild announced yesterday that the total amount of rice reserves in Shanghai is 300,481 bags, a decrease of 44,421 bags compared to last week. The warehouses storing the most rice are those of the Bank of China, China Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Shanghai Bank. It was also learned from rice industry groups that the early rice crops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces were slightly affected by the hurricane, while the late rice crops were not affected because they were not yet mature. The transportation of Kehsien rice from Wuhu to Shanghai has recently been obstructed by the Japanese, and merchants are currently negotiating for a solution.

Rice Reserves Still Sufficient for Three Months

According to rice industry insiders, the decrease in rice reserves is a natural phenomenon that occurs every year during this period. As for the total rice reserves in the city, including those in rice shops and those purchased and stored by citizens, it is estimated to be close to 300,000 bags. Based on the monthly consumption, the current rice reserves are still sufficient for three months.

### The New Fourth Army in Western Shanghai Has a Strong Military Appearance

A unit of the New Fourth Army, active in the Suzhou-Changzhou area, has been ordered to station in the guerrilla area of western Shanghai. This unit of the New Fourth Army arrived by roundabout routes, numbering more than a brigade, led by its commander. The soldiers wore steel helmets, cloth uniforms, and straw sandals, and were well-organized and formidable. The weapons they carried, rifles, were all Type 38 rifles manufactured in Showa 10 (1935), and light and heavy machine guns and small steel cannons were also manufactured in a certain country, all captured from the Japanese army. However, the Mauser pistols and hand grenades were the latest Chinese-made models. The average age of the soldiers was between sixteen and twenty-five, with no old or weak individuals. They arrived in the towns of western Shanghai on the 15th of this month.

### The Coolidge and a Japanese Ship Collide; Both Ships Sustain Minor Damage; Due to High Winds and Waves

The Continental Daily reports that the President Coolidge collided in the Huangpu River with the Japanese cargo ship Nisshin Maru shortly after arriving here from Japan yesterday (the 19th). Two passengers on the President Coolidge were nearly injured. The incident occurred at 1:45 PM. The giant trans-Pacific liner President Coolidge was turning around to point its bow south. It is reported that both ships sustained minor damage. The Japanese ship immediately

sailed into the sea after the collision, while the President Coolidge is scheduled to continue its voyage to Hong Kong at 5:00 PM today (the 20th). According to an eyewitness who spoke to a reporter last night, the President Coolidge was hit in the mid-section of its hull. One of the large steel plates on the promenade deck was dented, and part of the first-class dining room and one of the lower cabins were also damaged. When the two ships collided, two passengers on the President Coolidge were in their cabins. Although the cabin windows were pierced and the glass shattered, both managed to avoid injury. When the President Coolidge was

completely stopped near buoy number twelve, the Japanese ship Nisshin Maru was five hundred yards away, drifting downstream. Its engine had apparently been turned off. Another Japanese ship, Nagasaki Maru, was not far away, entering the Wusongkou a few minutes after the President Coolidge. However, it had sailed to the American ship in the Huangpu River before. The wind was strong at the time of the incident. The Japanese ship Nisshin Maru was sailing against the wind and eventually sailed near buoy number twelve, realizing it had lost control and collided with the President Coolidge. The

damage to the Nisshin Maru was mostly on the bow, thirty feet or more above the waterline. Although there was a slight commotion on the President Coolidge, everything was under perfect control. Engineers from the President Lines were immediately dispatched to board the ship for investigation. According to them, the ship sustained minor damage and should not be prevented from sailing south. According to President Lines personnel, the ship may sail to Hong Kong for necessary repairs.

### Copper Auxiliary Coin Vouchers to be Issued Soon; Shipped to Shanghai by Ship in Early Next Month

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Guild, and other public organizations telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to consider Shanghai's economic situation and promptly print and ship auxiliary coin vouchers to Shanghai for circulation. Upon receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Finance immediately instructed the Central Bank to entrust the Hong Kong Book Bureau to print new auxiliary coin vouchers, with a total issue amount of 2 million yuan, including denominations of one, two, and five cents, to be issued in four batches. It is learned that the first batch of 500,000 yuan of the new auxiliary coin vouchers will be printed and completed and can be shipped to Shanghai by ship from Hong Kong in early next month to begin distribution.

### White Russian Summer Resorts Repeatedly Obstructed

The Continental Daily reports that the White Russian Emigration Committee on Rue Molière is now openly assisting Japanese ships, placing various obstacles in the way of White Russian immigrants applying for passports to travel to various ports in the occupied areas on non-Japanese ships. The common practice is to not approve passports for White Russians who want to go to Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places for summer vacation, or who want to embark on British ships or

other foreign ships. They are sometimes forced to wait two or three weeks before the necessary documents are issued. Moreover, the committee openly tells most White Russians that this delay is because they want to travel on non-Japanese ships. There are also several White Russians who have applied for the approval of passports and want to embark on non-Japanese ships. The committee openly tells them that

it is better to travel on Japanese ships. Otherwise, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain passport approval. Yesterday (the 19th), it was learned that this action by the White Russian Emigration Committee, although not having a major impact on the shipping of third countries, also has slight signs of an anti-British movement being carried out by the Japanese, because British shipping companies are

more affected by this action than all other shipping companies. Most of those who go to Qingdao and Yantai for summer vacation this summer are White Russians. Although few of them travel in first class, the income from carrying passengers to these resorts from White Russians is also quite considerable.

### Rear Admiral Hepner Unwilling to Express His Feelings; Only Smiles and Says He Had a Comfortable Voyage; To Cruise in North China After Taking Office

Rear Admiral Hepner, the new commander of the Asian Fleet, arrived in Shanghai on the 19th with his wife and two daughters on the President Coolidge to take office. Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the outgoing Asian Fleet, General Glassford, commander of the Yangtze River Patrol, and Yarnell's chief of staff, Colonel Connell, were all at the dock to welcome him. After landing, Rear Admiral Hepner and his wife

accompanied Yarnell in the same car to the 13-story building on Avenue Albert for a rest. Chief of Staff Colonel Karle, who will replace Connell, came with Rear Admiral Hepner. Hepner's inauguration ceremony will be held together with the handover ceremony. When reporters asked him about his feelings and opinions about this trip, Hepner repeatedly shook his head and smiled, saying that he had

no feelings and no plans to announce, only saying that he had a comfortable voyage. Hepner graduated from the Naval Academy in 1899. From 1920 to 1922, he participated in the Spanish campaign and served on the British Channel Fleet. From 1922 to 1927, he was promoted to fleet commander and led the team in the

largest river in the United States, the Mississippi River. In 1929, he was promoted to rear admiral and was responsible for the defense of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In 1935, he served as the chairman of the General Board of the Navy Department in Washington. He recently left office. Rear Admiral Hepner's trip is his

second visit to China. His first visit to China was fifteen years ago, when Rear Admiral Hepner was serving as the commander of submarines of the Asian Fleet stationed in the Eastern seas. The submarine carried him from Manila to Qingdao. Rear Admiral Hepner is scheduled to take office on the 25th of this month and will cruise in North China in early next month.

### Exemption from Taxes and Unified Purchase; Exports Break New Records; However, Imports Continue to Increase in Occupied Ports; But the Mainland Can Save More Than Ten Million Pounds Annually

A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications yesterday that Shanghai's situation is special. The requirement to sell foreign exchange for export goods to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications has not yet been implemented. Therefore, the import of necessities can be applied for foreign exchange from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, but no orders have been received from the Ministry of Finance or the head office. It was also learned from the Customs that since the occupation of Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs has not implemented the requirement to settle foreign exchange for export goods, and the prohibition of imports of luxury goods and non-essential goods due to environmental reasons. Therefore, the import of luxury goods from the occupied areas remains the same. However, these luxury goods are only allowed to be sold in the occupied areas and are absolutely prohibited from being re-exported to non-occupied areas.

Promote the Export Trade of Local Goods

In order to promote the export trade of local goods, the method of settling foreign exchange and receiving exchange rate differences for export goods is stipulated, allowing local goods to be freely transported and sold to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. However, the foreign exchange obtained from the export of local goods should still be sold to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. In addition, the provinces are instructed to make efforts to increase production, exempt export taxes on local goods, and provide insurance and facilitate transportation. The four categories of tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals are purchased by the two regulatory agencies as much as possible, and designated new transportation lines are used to transport them to the port for centralized export. The export of local goods in the first few months of this year has increased to 83,541,327 yuan, creating the highest new record since the war. It is expected that the export value will further increase in the future.

Restrict Imports and Reduce Trade Deficit

After adjusting international trade and promulgating the method of prohibiting the import of goods, all designated luxury goods and non-essential goods, totaling 234 tariff items, are prohibited from import, as well as re-export to non-occupied areas, with the aim of reducing the trade deficit. Because the trade deficit of each port has increased sharply, taking May as an example, the trade deficit was as high as 90,585,697 yuan. Now, all ports in the non-occupied areas have been ordered to implement the import ban, so the trade deficit figures may gradually decrease, so that the whole price trade can be balanced and the adverse trend of international balance of payments can be reversed. This method is a necessary measure during wartime. After the ban, more than 23 million yuan, or 13 million pounds in gold, can be saved each year.

### Bank Employee Gambling and Embezzlement Sentenced

Fang Shanle, an employee of the Guangdong Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road, was heavily in debt due to gambling. He had no choice but to engage in private malpractice. In the past year, he embezzled approximately 40,000 yuan through fraud. After the bank discovered it, it reported it to the General Inspectorate. Chinese Detective Jiang Shangpei arrested Fang and sent him to the First Special Court. Attorney Ru Baoyi of the Inspectorate prosecuted him for embezzlement. After the trial was concluded, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict in the Criminal Court One yesterday morning. Fang Xile was sentenced to eight months in prison as a warning. In addition, in the civil lawsuit, Fang should return 38,728.7 yuan to the Guangdong Bank.

### Gang Robbery of Female Fortune Teller; Principal Offender Continued to be Apprehended; Three Offenders Tried Together

Jiang Tianzhen, a female fortune teller who was once a dancer, is 23 years old and a native of Hangzhou. After studying with female fortune teller Ling Qing, she has been offering her services at Room 511 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road for six years. However, Jiang was often coveted by bandits because of her modern attire and dazzling diamond rings. At 7:45 PM on the 8th of last month, a Liu, a guest from Room 316 of the Far East Hotel, summoned Jiang Tianzhen to tell his fortune. Jiang

went in full dress. After the fortune telling, she was threatened with a gun by people in the room and tied to a water pipe.

### Disputes Over Garbage Dumping; Puppet Side Uses the Excuse of Increased Population in the Concession; Demands an Annual Subsidy of 80,000 Legal Tender

In the past two weeks, Zhu Zengji, a garbage contractor in the French Concession, has been negotiating with the puppet side in the central area of the city on the issue of subsidies for garbage dumping, but there has been no good result. Before the war, all the garbage in the French Concession was barged from the Bund outside Xinkaihe to various places in Punan or Xinlonghua for dumping, and the contractor subsidized the municipal authorities with 20,000 national currency annually for sanitation fees. Recently, the puppet side discovered that there was profit to be made, and immediately imposed duress, prohibiting the garbage from being transported to the above-mentioned places for dumping. The contractor had no choice but to negotiate, accompanied by Russian policeman Yang Gaosiji. It is reported that the puppet side used the excuse of a sharp increase in the population of the French Concession, demanding an annual subsidy of 80,000 legal tender before dumping could be allowed. Russian policeman Yang was turned away for his dissatisfactory remarks, resulting in no outcome. In recent days, the two districts of the Public Concession and the French Concession have been obstructed by the Japanese puppets, and all the ships of neighboring farmers coming to Shanghai to purchase night soil fertilizer have been banned, causing a brief wave of unrest. Fortunately, the night soil contractor managed to sell it at the night soil factory.

As a result, Zhu was injured. After the incident occurred, the French police received a report and ordered an investigation. The results showed that Wu had committed an act of bodily harm, so they filed a public prosecution against Wu in the Criminal Court Eight of the Second Special Court in accordance with the law. After Judge Qiu conducted the interrogation, a verdict was announced yesterday, stating that Wu Xiquan committed bodily harm and was fined 10 yuan. If he refuses to do labor service, one yuan will be calculated as one day. However, considering that he is a first-time offender, he is granted a two-year probation.

She was discovered and rushed to a hospital in western Shanghai for treatment.

### Adventurous Sailing Ship Meets the Coolidge Liner in the Pacific Ocean; Coolidge's Captain and Anderson Stop Ship to Reminisce; Crew and Passengers Exchange Gifts of Objects and Books; Taiping Encountered Hardship but Continues Adventurously

The Continental Daily reports that the American mail steamer President Coolidge arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 19th) from Kobe, bringing news of its encounter at sea with the sailing ship Taiping, which had departed from Shanghai bound for San Francisco. Last Thursday, while en route from Honolulu to Yokohama, the Coolidge sighted a sailing ship flying the American flag in the distance. As it approached, they saw six people on board, one of whom was recognized by Captain Kolsmede of the President Coolidge. This person was Captain Anderson, who, in April, along with his Russian wife, four crewmen, and

a dog and a cat, had set sail from Shanghai in a 45-foot sailing ship bound for the Golden Gate Exposition and had encountered repeated misfortune. At the time, the Taiping was located at 34 degrees 43 minutes north latitude and 155 degrees 01 minute east longitude. A month earlier, Captain Kolsmede had met Anderson in Kobe and given him directions for his voyage, hence their acquaintance. When the President Coolidge was about 100 yards behind the Taiping, Captain Coolidge hailed loudly. Anderson heard him and waved in response. The Coolidge then stopped and gradually approached

the small sailing ship. At that time, the Taiping had been drifting in storms for seven days, with both food and water running low. The crew and passengers of the Coolidge enthusiastically gifted them with books, newspapers, candy, meat, flour, eggs, canned goods, and even frozen meat. They also filled the Taiping's seven water tanks with drinking water. According to Anderson, after the Taiping entered the sea, it had encountered two cargo ships passing nearby. The ship was not equipped with a radio and had drifted sixty miles off course. Captain Coolidge then redirected the ship,

heading east to avoid the storm and estimating that it would take 45 to 55 days to reach the United States, as Captain Anderson did not intend to sail to Honolulu or other islands. After docking alongside the Coolidge for an hour and a half, the Taiping set sail in a gentle breeze, with the passengers of the Coolidge cheering them on. The Taiping is equipped with a 14-horsepower auxiliary engine and carries enough fuel to operate day and night for twelve days, with a sailing rate of four and a half nautical miles per hour. Anderson and his wife originally set sail from Shanghai on April 7 with three Chinese and one Russian crew member.

However, the Chinese crew members all suffered from seasickness, and two of them died. Anderson then returned to Shanghai and hired two Norwegian sailors, for a total of six people, and set sail again on April 22. En route to Japan, one of the crew members fell ill but recovered. On April 28, the Taiping docked in Japan for repairs, but when leaving Kobe, the crew member's illness recurred, forcing him to return to Shanghai alone. Anderson then found a replacement in Kobe. When the Taiping encountered the President Coolidge at sea last week, it had already

been at sea for 29 days. Anderson has 31 years of sailing experience. This time, he is determined to sail to the United States and exhibit his sailing ship at the Golden Gate Exposition and the New York World's Fair. If he cannot reach the New York fair before it closes, Anderson also intends to sail to New York and then to the World Games held in Europe in 1940. Recent attempts to cross the Pacific before the Taiping include: (1) American Dr. Petersen's Hermel Hermel; (2) Mr. Nichols's Merlin, the boat was lost, but all on board were rescued; (3) Russian adventurer Zachinko's boat, which was lost, but all on board were rescued; (4) American Heileburg's Sea Dragon, which was also lost.

### Jiang Jianqiu's Romantic Theft Case; Female Performer Appears in Court for Confrontation; Hearing of Jiang Jianqiu Suddenly Prohibits Public Attendance; Defendant Retracts Confession and Denies Knowing This Woman; Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 27th

Jiang Jianqiu, a romantic thief from Jiangxi, caused a sensation in society. He usually acted lavishly and repeatedly impersonated the owners of major stores, using fraudulent means to deceive women, defiling them and stealing their property. He was apprehended by the Public Concession police and brought to the First Special District Court for prosecution, where he was sentenced to five years in prison. Later, the police found that the suspect had committed similar crimes within the concession, so they sent detectives to bring Jiang back into custody and send him to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. During the court hearing, in addition to confessing to opening rooms with Zhou Jinxiang, the concubine of a wealthy family, Li Didi, Zhu Xiuxia, Xing Sannan, a prostitute from Han Zhuang, Liu Jindi, and female guides Chen Lingyang and Chen Lijun, and stealing ornaments, he also

implicated three female performers, Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, and Yao Yuchan, claiming to have had relationships with them and given them property. The case was originally concluded by Judge Qiu Huanhan, pending sentencing. However, for the sake of thoroughness, it was deemed necessary to conduct a detailed investigation and cross-examination, so the closing arguments were revoked and a new trial was ordered. Summons were issued to the three female performers, Mao, Yu, and Yao, and all the victims to appear in court on time for questioning. These details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning marked

the date for the reopening of the trial. Since the case occurred, it has attracted considerable attention from the public, who all wanted to see the demeanor of the romantic thief and to catch a glimpse of the faces of Mao, Yu, and Yao. Therefore, before dawn, the court opened its doors, and those who came to observe filled the seats. Mao Jianqiu, accompanied by her father, Mao Yunke, arrived at the court and sat silently in the waiting room. Mao wore a blue cloth cheongsam, without any makeup, appearing very quiet. At 8:30 a.m., Judge Qiu began the trial in the eighth court, first ordering the hearing of other minor cases. At 10:30 a.m., he began the hearing of this case, ordering the defendant Jiang Jianqiu to be brought before the court. Jiang appeared composed, wearing a monk's collar short-sleeved striped shirt and pants, with a fierce face, high cheekbones, and a short stature. After providing his year of birth and place of origin, the prosecuting attorney from the police, Gu Shouxu, stated the case and charged him with crimes such as theft and fraud. Detective Sui Wenzhi, who handled the case, reported that, except for the female performer Yu Guifen, who had recently married and was on her honeymoon, and Yao Yuchan, who was currently in Nanjing and

could not be summoned, Mao Jianqiu, Chen Cuiyang, Chen Lijun, and Chen Wangshi had all complied with the summons and presented the stolen goods, including two women's spring coats, five long-haired tiger绒 women's coats, nine gold rings, and five watches. First, the victim Chen Wangshi testified that she lived at 27 Pi Shao Nai Road and that in March, while passing through Fa Da Road, the defendant stole a watch from her and requested its return. Next, Chen Cuiying and Chen Lijun testified that they were employees of the Yang Guifei Xiang Society and admitted to having opened rooms with Jiang and having been cheated out of their property. During the testimony,

their demeanor was light and cheerful, eliciting laughter, which was stopped by the bailiff. When questioned, Mao Jianqiu testified that she was 22 years old, from Xiangyang, Hubei, and worked as a performer. She also stated that according to the report, the defendant testified in court about having opened a room with Jianqiu on March 18, but she was sick and on leave on March 17 and entered the Sino-Western Sanatorium for treatment until February 21, when she returned to the stage. She also presented medical prescriptions and other evidence in court. At this point in the questioning, the court suddenly announced that the case involved public morals and prohibited public attendance. Upon hearing the announcement, the observers reluctantly left one after another. At that time, the weather turned unfavorable,

and a heavy rain poured down, soaking everyone. Afterward, it was heard that the defendant suddenly retracted his previous confession in court, claiming that he did not know this Mao Jianqiu and that the Mao Jianqiu he knew was taller than her (referring to the female performer) and was someone's concubine. Then, according to the female performer, she did not know Jiang, and she had never worn a diamond ring. After questioning, the court ruled that the case was clear and ordered closing arguments. The lawyer for the French Concession authorities, Gu Shouxi, argued that the defendant should be punished according to the three crimes of theft, fraud, and robbery. The defendant was then asked if he had any final statements, and the court ordered the closing arguments to be concluded, with sentencing scheduled for the 27th. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Publication of "International Financial Market" - Translated by Liu Kongjun -

"International Financial Market" was originally written by John T. Madden and Marcus Nadier, professors at New York University in the United States, and published in 1935. It is based on field investigations and studies of the changes in the gold task and the reasons for its collapse after the major changes in the international financial market from 1931 to 1935, and describes the organization and operation of international financial centers. Therefore, the entire book starts with gold and the gold standard, and then discusses the international market, as well as the financial organization and operation of major international financial markets around the world, such as London, New York, and Paris, and the reaction of the post-war economy. The collapse of the gold standard in the past ten years has been traced back to its causes and effects. Translated into a book by Mr. Liu Kongjun, it is published by Zhengzhong Bookstore. Mr. Liu works in the banking industry. With his knowledge and experience, the translation of this book is clear and concise, so it avoids the dryness of financial books at the moment.

### Silk and Satin Bureau Shareholders Collude with Employees to Embezzle Woolen Serge; Report Plane Bombing Cargo during Shipment from Songjiang to Shanghai; Major Shareholder Reports Arrest and Detention for Investigation

Zhang Zhongchi of Songjiang invested 30,000 yuan with Chen Fangping, Chen Huanglong, Chen Jishi, Chen Qiyin, Zhang Chenshi, and others in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China to open the Yuanda Silk and Satin Bureau in Miaoyan Temple, Songjiang. Zhang invested 15,000 yuan, and the rest was invested by Chen Fangping and the other five. Over the years, due to effective management, the business flourished and there was an annual surplus. In the 26th year of the Republic of China,

after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Japanese aircraft bombed Songjiang. Zhang Zhongchi was deeply afraid that the goods would be damaged, so he hired two gasoline boats to entrust Chen Fangping's employee Yang Shutang to transport woolen serge worth more than 60,000 yuan (currently worth about 100,000 yuan) to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, after Chen and Yang arrived in Shanghai, they suddenly reported to Zhang Zhongchi that the goods sent to Shanghai had been

bombed and completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft when passing through Zhujing. At the time, Zhang also thought that the facts were possible, so he did not doubt it. But recently, Zhang suddenly heard that the goods had not been bombed and were transported to Shanghai by Chen and Yang, who embezzled them and sold them one after another for personal gain. Therefore, he immediately began investigating and discovered that after Chen and Yang arrived in Shanghai, they opened a room at 31 Datong Hotel, 4 Lane 21, Hubei Road, and lived there. The hotel

accountant proved that when Chen and others came, they brought a large number of packages, all with the word "Yuanda" on them, which filled a room. After four days, they moved away, which further proved the fraudulent behavior of Chen and Yang. Therefore, on the 19th, he reported to the Laozha Police Station, and Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan investigated and confirmed the facts. That night, at 11:30 p.m., Chen Fangping and Yang Shutang were arrested at 67 Lane 613, Xiafei Road,

and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that the case still needed to be investigated in detail, so he requested that the two defendants be detained for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, both defendants still insisted that the goods transported to Shanghai had indeed been bombed. The court then ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and rescheduled for questioning in a week.

### Wide Bravery

— Geng Zhi

On the streets of the city, I often see such comedies: the one with big fists and thick arms, grabs the skinny "chicken ribs" and beats them hard; a large group of people, even carrying guns and sticks, confront one or two people with no weapons; a young and strong lad beats an old man with gray hair and bloodies his head, or beats a "ugly duckling" with feathers still growing, making them cry; a man, a real man, slaps a woman to the ground and kicks her against the wall… I always applaud these heroes who have the upper hand and gain the advantage, and secretly praise them, saying: How brave, truly rare, and these heroes are indeed capable, often able to fulfill their desires, no matter how the opponent evades or begs for mercy, they will always thoroughly "punish" them, giving the bystanders a good time: Brave warrior! Brave warrior! How can the people live without brave warriors!

In other places, I have also seen another kind of warrior: cursing at people, standing in their own place, saying to the other party, "If you have the guts, come over here"; on the one hand, they roll up their sleeves, take off their shoes, and make all kinds of poses of preparing for battle, waiting for the other party to do the same, and then "I will not offend others unless others offend me", and then, after three rounds of drums, they do not see the clash of weapons, and then they withdraw their troops, thus preserving the great courage of "seeming weak", each with their own merits; in case the other party does not know what is good, does not understand this trick of mutually praising each other to become famous for bravery, and actually acts aggressively, jumping forward and wanting to get their way, our warriors, although using the best of the Thirty-Six Strategies, will still turn around and say, "If you have the guts, stand there and don't run, wait for me to go back and call my brother!" Thus, the high arrogance still surpasses the other party, and the name of bravery can be preserved forever!

It seems that the reason why bravery is bravery, with the above people, we can already see more than one aspect of it, and there is no need to ask more people, right? Therefore, the conditions for bravery that have been passed down throughout history can be seen to be all wrong. If you don't believe it, you can explain it as follows:

"Reflecting on oneself and shrinking", wanting to enter the "millions of people" with bare hands is just like an ant, trampled to death, why bother; "not scratching the skin" will have the pain of broken skin and bleeding, "not escaping the eyes" will have the danger of having your eyes poked out, isn't that wrong; if "the brave" is "not afraid", wouldn't they become an unfilial son, because "the body and hair are received from parents", they should "not dare to destroy them", wouldn't they be self-inflicted madmen, because "those who know fate do not stand under the rock wall"; the "great courage" of calming the world with anger is, after all, just talk, because anger is not originally "courage"; "Greeks meet Greeks", how can there be so many "Greeks" for you to "meet", and you must "meet your opponent" to play chess, which is naturally extremely stupid…

Therefore, the warriors that have been passed down throughout history are also deceiving people. If you don't believe it, please see: Jing Ke, who assassinated the King of Qin, had to hide the dagger in the picture, and Zhuan Zhu, who assassinated King Liao, had to hide the sword in the fish intestine, inevitably concealing and sneaking; "taking the head of the general from a million troops is like taking something out of a bag" "My brother Yide, although he flaunted his might on Changban Bridge for a while, the result was still "burning the bridge and retreating"; all the way to the "Baturu" of the Qing Dynasty, although it was a well-deserved "brave title", those who had this "brave" title were actually a few "old guns"; plus the Western Mr. Don Quixote, how heroic and self-satisfied, but he fought against "windmills", and compared to A Q, who claimed "the old man beats the son", wasn't he just as good at self-deprecation, giving people a bad impression…

The so-called natural and righteous bravery is only the various things I said at the beginning; the so-called true, non-negotiable warriors are only the several heroes I said at the beginning. To sum up, bravery is: the strong bullying the weak; the many abusing the few; the young and strong deceiving the old and weak; men bullying women… warriors are: robbers; thugs; hooligans; bums… From now on, our concepts of bravery and warriors must be completely changed. If I am not seeing too little and being surprised, then I am ignorant of the truth, and naturally the disaster of not recognizing Mount Tai with my eyes is even greater.

Confucius even scolded Zilu, who was fond of bravery, saying, "I will not associate with those who wrestle with tigers and cross rivers, and die without regret." Now, in the international community, it is also popular to annex the weak and break the old saying that "winning is not martial." My words are the bravery I am promoting, so what is wrong with it!

### Rapid Shoal

— Xu Qing

The young people are singing again, the melody divided into two parts. Some have only sung to the end, while others have started again, cycling endlessly.

The helmsman, with his goatee, impatiently tapped the deck, then, as if showing off, said:

"Look, the rapid shoal is just ahead, you need to be quiet! Everyone crowded together, the bow won't be able to lift up in a bit!"

His words dampened the singing, bringing it to an end.

"Alright! Who doesn't know that!"

"You don't put in the effort yourself, and you blame others. If we don't get to the market tonight, we'll be hungry tomorrow morning!"

This complaint stirred resentment in the pole-pusher at the bow:

"It's truly unjust! Everything has its time! Just because you haven't studied, do you think you can become an official?"

"You guys--" The youngest one stopped before he could finish speaking. Then everyone fixed their eyes on what lay ahead.

A surge of panting like the sound of pine trees shattered the sudden silence. The river spread into a rapid current two hundred yards wide, with the feet of two mountains stretching straight into the river. A line of reefs further blocked the current, causing the waves to roar madly.

The flat-bottomed boat moved upstream along the edge of the rapids, the sound of the water transforming from panting to thunder.

"Ah yo, ai ya!" A mournful cry trembled, a sturdy waist braced against a pole, the bow of the boat suddenly lifted toward the rapids, and then the entire vessel plunged into the roaring current.

On the shore: The trackers, backs arched like two herons, stepped on a rock, trod through a thicket of thorns, the fierce sun scorching their dark purple backs and shoulders, the tow rope constantly whistling.

"Ah yo, ai ya!" This time, the deep, solid shoulders lunged forward, the pole bending into a semicircle.

"Ah yo, ai ya!" The long chorus from the shore lightened the burden, as if in a trance.

"Everyone lean to the sides! We're almost through the rapids!" The helmsman's voice was hoarse.

The rapid shoal was passed, the river again weaving a light, blue dream.

The pole-pusher put down his pole, collapsing with exhaustion, and took up his bamboo pipe to smoke languidly. The helmsman stroked his beard, silently. The trackers waded through the water, heedless of their wet feet as they strode onto the boat. The young passengers broke the silence once more.

"Hey! Boatman! Say 'Get up!' alright? Ah yo, ai ya! Who hurt you?"

"Alright! Whatever you say!" A smoke ring puffed from the big mouth.

"Shen Chun'gen! Can you sing?"

The loyal tracker nodded.

Thus, the passionate singing rose again, refined and crude blending together.

The river was clear and smooth, and a newly brimming song flowed from the boatmen's mouths:

"...Forward! Advance!"

"Get up!..."

Cycling, cycling.

### Graduation, Then to the Front!

— Written by Wu Yun

### Joy (3)

True and great joy comes from communion between God and man. When it is said that man has communion with God, at first hearing, it sounds illusory, but it is actually very real. Why? Because man's communion with God is due to man's faith. It does not require knowledge, learning, material things, diligence, or seeking. It only requires faith, true and unfeigned. God immediately communes with man. This is the closest and most real thing, not empty talk. Some people say: "I believe in the existence of God, and I believe that God is the only true God. I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and (perhaps) I also believe that Jesus is the Word made flesh (even less certain). Why do I have no joy?" I say that even demons believe. Your faith is on the same level as the demons' faith. The true God has no relationship with you. Even if there is a relationship, it is only God's wrath that is constantly upon you. You only have worry and fear; how can you have joy? If you take such belief as faith, it is simply self-deception. At best, the result of self-deception is merely to anesthetize yourself. Anesthesia is temporary, not permanent. The joy, if any, is fleeting, coming and going suddenly. This kind of joy is neither true nor great. The true and great joy I am talking about comes from faith. Faith communes with God. The true meaning of faith is trust; trust is obedience. If you have faith but do not obey, that is the faith of demons. What is obedience? It is doing what God says, word for word, step by step. Where is God's word? In the Bible. Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God? Do you truly wish to obey God's word without deceiving yourself or others? Then I can guarantee that you will receive joy from heaven.

### Red Devil Vasika

— Written by Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou

"Marriage...is that possible? I haven't been to church in three years...this is terrible! Oh, you've found a good wife! Do you think I'll bear you children?"

The thought of children made him laugh inside. Vasika looked at her face and said nothing more...

"Ah, where are you taking me? Look...it's all the same. You're taking me somewhere to kill me, right? Aren't you a famous weirdo?"

"Shut up!" Vasika said softly.

But as she recalled everything that had happened in the past, she began to enumerate his cruelties.

"Please be quiet!" he begged her, but she ignored him, so he croaked:

"I told you to stop talking!"

That night they didn't say another word. In the night, Vasika talked in his sleep, guttural sounds and groans coming from his broad chest. He bit his teeth and patted his chest from time to time, waving his right hand back and forth in the air.

Ajiusniya woke up and stood by his bed, watching his face in terror for a long time. Finally, she woke him up:

"What's wrong with you? Is the devil tattooing your neck?"

"Yes, I had a dream!..." Vasika said weakly, "Give me some water."

After drinking the water, he shook his head and said:

"No, no, I won't open a den,...I should just do business,...a den is useless..."

"Do business..." she said as she thought, "Yes, opening a store, that's good!"

"Together, okay?" Vasika asked softly, as if trying to convince her.

"Are you telling the truth?" Ajiusniya cried, taking a few steps back from his bed.

"Ajiusniya, Seminovna!" Vasika raised his head from the pillow and said in a trembling voice.

"Then, you..." (Thirteen)

Old News Re-Copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (1936)

(From the Shen Qing Tongzhi Eleventh Year edition of this newspaper)

### Li Guangzhao's Falsified Timber Price Case

The Emperor wanted to build the Yuanmingyuan and needed to procure a large amount of timber. The former Minister of the Internal Affairs Department, Cheng Ming, the former acting Director of the Internal Affairs Department, Gui Bao, and the Internal Affairs Department candidate Secretary, Cheng Lin, knew a timber merchant in Beijing named Li Guangzhao, and immediately brought him to see the officials. According to Li, if they went to Sichuan and other provinces to fell trees in the mountains, with a labor cost of 3,000 taels of silver, they could claim a value of 50,000 taels of silver. Thus, they ordered him to go and fell the trees, and he went to Beijing with Cheng Lin of the three men. Later, when he arrived in Hubei, he learned that felling trees in the mountains would take three years to leave the mountains, and the labor cost was too high. He went to Guangdong and Hong Kong to buy foreign timber. At that time, the French merchant Bovieley had timber for sale. Li hesitated at first because he had no money, but Cheng Lin wanted to use this to fill a vacancy, and said that he could borrow from his relatives, so they immediately decided to buy. Cheng Lin first took a sample of the timber back to Beijing, and Li went to Fuzhou to negotiate with Bovieley, agreeing to buy three ships of timber, totaling 35,000 foreign feet, at a price of one yuan and five jiao five fen per foot, totaling 54,250 silver yuan. They signed a contract, stating that the timber would be delivered and paid for in Beijing. If there was any delay, the daily ship price would be increased by 50 silver yuan. Li arrived in Tianjin in May, and Bovieley smuggled the first ship of timber. Li immediately went to Beijing to report the number of timber in the Internal Affairs Department, falsely reporting more than 55,500 foreign feet, worth more than 300,000 taels of silver. Because Cheng Lin had nowhere to borrow, and lacked funds to pay, the delivered timber was also unsuitable. He and the foreign merchant accused each other. It was found that he had carved the title of "Li, Imperial Envoy for Mining and Transporting Timber for the Yuanmingyuan" and made items such as "Imperial Decree for Purchasing" flags. A copy of the foreign language contract was also found. After translation, it contained the words "Li, Supervisor of the Yuanmingyuan, on behalf of the Emperor of the Great Qing, signed with so-and-so." According to Li, there was no such sentence in Chinese, and the foreign language was a mistranslation. However, the Chinese contract is now missing. After investigation by the Directing Governor Li Hongzhang, it was confirmed that he had falsely reported the timber price and was fraudulent and illegal. He also impersonated the supervisor of the Yuanmingyuan and cheated everywhere. He intends to submit a memorial requesting the death penalty with reprieve.

Spring and Autumn

### Squeezing and Exchanging

— Luo Lin

"The use of North China currency is banned!" Tens of thousands jostle at the bank doors.

On the sixteenth, a "rumor" suddenly arose in the market that Shanghai would stop using currency with North China place names. However, a "rumor" is, after all, a "rumor." Didn't it also spread widely last year, and later it was still usable? So everyone didn't quite believe it. On the seventeenth, the "rumor" grew larger and larger, and everyone began to panic. On the afternoon of the seventeenth, all banks uniformly refused to accept it, and the "rumor became a fact." There was considerable panic and confusion in the market. The morning newspaper on the eighteenth also published it openly, and the whole city immediately erupted in commotion. Everyone immediately busied themselves checking their legal currency, picking out the North China notes. Fortunately, the banks were still willing to exchange them, otherwise, wouldn't we be ruined?

The banks that issued North China currency included the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Merchants Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the China Land Reclamation Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Four Banks, the Hebei Provincial Bank, and the Dazhong Bank.

Exchange Locations

The Bank of China is on Avenue Joffre; the Bank of Communications is at Jing'an Temple; the China Merchants Bank is on the Bund; the China Land Reclamation Bank is on Sanma Road; the Four Banks are on Sichuan Road... no need to list them all one by one, they are all handled in their head offices.

Pilgrimage to Various Banks

Next to the Bank of China on Avenue Joffre, there is a long alley. People exchanging money lined up in a snake-like queue, four or five zhang long each queue, with four or five queues in succession. Strict order must be maintained, with no rushing or pushing. A large number of bank staff maintained the "queues." At first, the Bank of China only had one window handling the exchange. No matter how fast the clerks were, for every one that left, two came. It was really too late. The scene of everyone scrambling to exchange for legal currency when it was first implemented was still vividly before my eyes. Around half past eleven, there were still several hundred people. Seeing that this was really not right, they added another window, increasing the number of staff at each window. It was still too late!

The Bank of Communications at Jing'an Temple had no alley to line up in. Everyone crowded at the entrance, fighting and grabbing, and the order was quite bad (queues were also formed in the afternoon). There were also quite a few people at the Farmers Bank of China and the Bank of Agriculture. Other commercial banks, such as the China Merchants Bank and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, originally issued fewer notes, and there was not much in circulation outside, so there was no such crowding.

Numerical Limits

Each bank only exchanged its own issued banknotes, and the amount was also limited. The Bank of China stipulates a maximum of one hundred yuan per person. Therefore, some people with a large amount kept coming again and again, anyway, the clerks were busy and didn't recognize you. Banknotes were insufficient, and wooden boxes of banknotes were transported in by trucks.

Other banks also had limits, varying from fifty to one hundred yuan. None of the large ones exceeded one hundred yuan. The banknotes paid out were all one-yuan notes, as there was a contraction in the circulation of large denomination legal currency.

Temporary Business

Where there is food, there is an unconstrained imagination, and no opportunity is missed. A group of people had teamed up to do this once-in-a-millennium good business. They crowded in front in groups of three or four, and could exchange money for you, charging between three and five fen per yuan. Those who didn't want to crowd were happy to save effort. But you had to be careful. If you blinked, and didn't watch them closely, both the people and the legal currency would fly away. Go negotiate with the ghosts! Brothers of the "three hands" were displaying their supernatural powers, and wallets disappearing from pockets were everywhere. You had to be careful.

Noble ladies;

### Beware of Counterfeit Stamps

— Tang Kemin

Because of the shortage of fractional currency, stamps have become the only substitute in the market. Everyone is consistently using them, still maintaining the overall market, preventing the villains from realizing their conspiracy to cause trouble. Who knew they would rack their brains and calculate on stamps. Recently, I used a five-cent counterfeit stamp, because its color was about the same as the real one, and the amount was small. Inadvertently, it slipped into my pocket. Later, when I got home and looked at it, I determined that it was fake. Five-cent stamps are green. The fake one is a deeper color than the real one. The portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen on the stamp face is larger. There are more patterns in the two pillars on the sides. The paper is thinner than the real one, the printing is poor, and the glue on the back has no stickiness. With the above many flaws, it is undoubtedly fake. From this, we can see a glimpse of the villains' intentions. These small denomination stamps circulate on the market, and people mostly don't pay attention. The most pitiful are the general peddlers. They earn very little from transactions of one or two cents. If they use a few fake ones, wouldn't they be working for nothing for a day? Readers, please beware of these counterfeit stamps, and at the same time, I hope the authorities will pay attention.

### Watermelon Supplement

— Simon

The article "This Year's Watermelons" published on the 19th was drafted and sent by the author before the first typhoon occurred. However, after a typhoon, an abnormal change occurred in both the melon fields and the melon market. I should add a supplement, lest readers consider it inaccurate.

First of all, after a rainstorm, the melon vines in the melon fields were blown off by the wind, and a year of harvest suddenly became a year of famine. Although the early-ripening melons had already been sold for money, the late-ripening melons were greatly discounted, and the second-crop melons were even worse. Therefore, the farmers who grow watermelons are all wearing mourning faces. We only need to see that the watermelon boats have not arrived at the Old Zha Bridge these days to know that the watermelons have been hit by the wind and rain. In a few days, when it clears up, the weather will be hot and there will be less wind, and it is inevitable that the price of watermelons will be unusually high.

At the same time, watermelon vendors are also complaining about the weather and blaming others, shouting that they are unlucky. The windy and rainy, Lesser Heat weather is so cool that no one is asking about the watermelons they brought in. Moreover, the watermelons brought in a few days ago were very expensive. If they want to sell them these days, they have to reduce the price. They are unwilling to lose money, and they want to put them at home and wait for the weather to get hot before selling them at a good price. Watermelons are not like other things, they will rot if they are left for too many days, and the weather is always not hot, as if deliberately fighting against the watermelon vendors.

In short, two typhoons have overturned the entire watermelon market.

### Biographies of Female Storytellers

— Shen You

During that time, both Zhu Youxiang and Shi Yuelan received poems from the literary guests of Bangjiang. The poem praising Youxiang says: "Innocent and naive Zhu Youxiang, the pipa and small clapper make melodious sounds. She is also娇憨and truly reliable, It is good that she is restrained by her mother's side." The poem praising Yuelan says: "Elegant and dignified Yueran, The demeanor of a great lady sits in the book hall. A song of陽春causes everyone to listen attentively, Do not regard her as an ordinary example." Both can be used as supplementary explanations. In addition, the "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Songs" praise female storytellers, in addition to Yuan Yunxian, Yan Lizhen, Chen Yue'e, Zhu Sulan, Xu Yayun, and Xu Shiyu, and also mentions the following four:

Wang Lijuan - Heaven has repeatedly sent a fairy to掌书, Wang Lijuan should be the leader. A kind of elegant and high style, Why must we let Cheng Lian move emotions?

Wang Youjuan - Youjuan is extremely intelligent, Her light smile and frown are even more pitiful. Her weak constitution cannot withstand being too thin, Do not let her stand in the wind, so fair.

Qian Yaqing - She assists in pouring wine while 按拍at the banquet, The oriole's voice echoes around the painted beams. Yaqing is especially good at singing refined songs, The pipa accidentally touches and attracts Zhou Lang.

Chen Aiqing - When she casually plays the sandalwood zither, she has emotions, The strange sound emits a heartbreaking sound. Why does someone especially like to sing the songs of Ba, Do you know there is an Aiqing in the bookstore?

As for the fair Gong's "Ding Chou Shanghai Bookstore Fairy Beauty List," it mentions twenty-eight people. The ones that also appear in the works of Shiping Sou and Bangjiang literary guests are Zhu Zilan, Chen Yue'e, and Chen Zhixiang. The twenty-five who have not been seen before. This is also an indispensable historical material for the study of female storytellers. The original text of Gong's publication was published in "Shen Bao," and it is strongly suspected that it is Wang Tao's so-called "Washer of Ears on the Wu Song River." The full text of this "Book List" is now recorded below:

### Spring Shen Bamboo Branch Words

— Xiang Lan

Spring Shen is good, a refuge like a paradise, Singing and dancing is still peaceful, while The flames of war spread across the mountains and rivers, Ignoring the sound of battles.

Spring Shen is good, Making a fortune from the national crisis, Foreign exchange is privately operated by three hands, Hoarding grain does not save thousands of disasters, and The profiteer smiles.

Spring Shen is good, The gambling den is like a demon palace, The traffic is busy day and night, Calling "Lu" and drinking "Zhi" compete for dominance, and A single throw is an instant of ruin.

Since the national army retreated to the west, On the Spring Shen River, ladies are like clouds, But they only seek safety for the moment, and There are many who ignore the sound of artillery fire. Recently, prices have soared, manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, and The foreign exchange black market is actually self-operated by the silver industry. It is a pity that those who make money from the national crisis go in and out recklessly, and all are sent to the demon palace. It is rumored that those who are keen on gambling are generous and spend hundreds of gold without stinginess. In the bustling summer heat, I compose a vulgar poem to express my feelings.

Random Notes on Performers

### Silver Dream (Part 1)

— Recorded by Xin Shi

—Narrated by Silver Star Miss Li Hong—

Editor's Introduction: Li Hong, a Cantonese, is now eighteen years old. Because she has lived in the North for a long time, she speaks fluent Mandarin. She entered the silver screen in her early years and became famous for her starring role in "First Love." Although she has only acted in four films, including "Tears of Love," "Demon of Desire," and "Lin Chong," she has already gained an excellent reputation and her artistic career is progressing rapidly. She has already achieved a very superior position in the film industry.

Three years ago, I often had silvery daydreams. Besides studying at school, I was single-mindedly looking forward to trying the flavor of the silver screen. It's really funny, I was indeed a standard movie fan.

Under a suitable opportunity, I really realized my dream and started working in the silver screen. Now, this life is like a dream, and two years have already passed. However, what kind of flavor is it exactly?

Starting at the Beginning

In 1936, I was lecturing at Jinling University in Nanjing, and I was a sophomore in the Physics and Chemistry Department. At that time, the state-run Central Film Studio was recruiting actors to prepare for the filming of "Secret Code." I went to take the exam in order to realize my dream. Although "ambition came to fruition" due to the obstacle of my height not being very suitable for the tall male lead Gao Zhanfei, after being admitted, I still didn't go to the set to film.

Trying Acting in Plays

Several colleagues in "Zhongdian" initiated the organization of the "China Drama Society" to perform plays. Because I had no films to shoot at the time, I was happy to join, hoping to gain some experience. The first play was "Thunderstorm," and I was responsible for the role of Sifeng. This role cannot rest from beginning to end, and the performance is extremely demanding. My physique was not very good, and at that time, I was still suffering from an uncured illness. My companions were very worried, thinking that I could at most muddle through two shows, and there was no possibility of lasting. Who knew that "Thunderstorm" was performed for a month, and I became more and more excited as I performed, and my illness was completely gone. Many people joked with me about this. "You were born to do this business." It's true, I decided to become such a laborer from then on.

First Taste of the Flavor

While "Thunderstorm" was being staged again. An official from Yihua Company happened to be watching the play and appreciated my performance, saying that I was quite suitable for filming. Therefore, through an introduction, a deal was reached. After "Thunderstorm" finished its one-month run, I hurried to Shanghai and entered the silver circle. At that time, "First Love" was being filmed. At first, I thought it wouldn't be too difficult. Unexpectedly, the first taste of the flavor was beyond my expectations. The more anxious I was, the more difficult it was to act well. There were really too many NG shots. The most interesting and inexplicable thing was a performance of sleeping in bed with my eyes closed. No matter how I filmed it, I couldn't get it right. I don't know if it was because the lights were too strong, but the more I wanted to close my eyes, the more they opened. Up to now, similar performances still cannot close my eyes, and I can only find a way to avoid them, or reshoot the back view. This is really incomprehensible and extremely strange.

### My View on Chaozhou Opera

— Shizhen

Normally, Chaozhou opera is not performed in Shanghai. It only comes for a limited engagement every three or four years, so it attracts many Chaozhou opera enthusiasts. Its ticket prices are not lower than those of ordinary Peking opera (Chaozhou opera tickets are generally around one yuan), but how much do Chaozhou people long for the opera of their hometown!

This time, the troupe is "Old San Zheng Shun Xiang," which is very famous in Chaozhou. They came once three or four years ago, and the popularity of their performances broke the record for Chaozhou opera performances that year. However, this time it is indeed not as good as the last time. The performers in the troupe are not as complete as last time. The voices, acting, and appearance are all worse. The most regrettable thing is that Cai Yongsheng, the genuine young male lead from before, used to win praise every time he performed. His voice was clear and graceful, and his demeanor was elegant and unrestrained. Since returning home, his voice has deteriorated, and now he has been reduced to a supporting role. What a pity! The current leading female role, Qin Wen, has a high voice, but her acting is stiff and not as good as Weng Binglin (another female role). Other noteworthy performers include Ke Jinxiang, Lin Runqiu, and Huang Wucheng.

Although some of the plots are in line with the times, most of them are obscene and very illogical. This is the biggest shortcoming of Chaozhou opera. Finally, I would like to say to "Old San Zheng Shun Xiang," strive to select plays with national significance and in line with the times. (End)

### Random Musings by the Fence (Part Two)

— Yu Tang

I initially thought that the Golden Theater was small and acoustically good, so singing with Ju Peng's resonant voice would be sure to sound great. But after listening several times in a row, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. Sometimes, I had to concentrate fully to hear even a single word. The reason is still Ju Peng's deliberate pursuit of perfection. He painstakingly projects each word from the back of his throat, but also focuses all his attention on "playing" those delicate little tunes. He doesn't have enough breath, so neither the words nor the tunes can reach far. In addition, the accompanying erhu's tone is very weak. The more it tries to follow and match, the more clumsy and cumbersome it seems, making the listener restless. Just think, besides the words and tunes, what else is left in Ju Peng's performance? As for his appearance and movements, apart from a few people who are fascinated by his antiquarian charm, that expressionless face, like a puppet, causes laughter in every scene. One thing I want to defend him for is that no one can hear Ju Peng's good singing, but the few applause he gets are precisely for his most unbearable poor melodies.

Cao Cao's Empty City, Running the Slope, and Hong Yang Cave are all Ju Peng's masterpieces, and also plays that I am familiar with. The models of the predecessors have been admired for a long time, and I dare not criticize them in the slightest. I admire his attention to detail and authenticity, but I have always believed that his excessive focus on cleverness is a bad transformation. Ju Peng may think that he can increase his "immediate" reputation by doing so, but on the contrary, this will affect his future status. The Golden Theater's continuous full houses are the result of people's fascination with Ju Peng's early excellent records, not to "see" Ju Peng on stage today. Many people like to follow trends and admire chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, but they may not all be able to appreciate the beauty of the chrysanthemum.

Mr. Su Shaoqing felt refreshed after listening to Ju Peng's "thief" in Empty City and "leisure" in Hong Yang Cave, thinking that even if the whole play was terrible, these two words alone would be enough to enjoy. This is a kind of humor and also an artist's prejudice, not enough to talk to ordinary people. Finally, he said that he had a thousand words to say to vent his feelings, and I am eager to read this great article, which will surely scratch many itches. Ju Peng has a very rich knowledge of old plays. He told me that he planned to write something for fellow enthusiasts to pass on to future generations. For eight years, he has been too lazy, and I guess he hasn't written a single word. Mr. Su is said to have his "incendiary pen" about to burst, and I hope he doesn't also become lazy and have a miscarriage. Because his article will definitely give Ju Peng's art a definite evaluation.

### Iron Voice, Steel Throat: Talking about Yue Di

— Liu Zhengzhu

Who doesn't know Qiu Yue Di when you mention her? She is the younger sister of the famous female performer Meng Xiaodong and the niece of the renowned teacher Qiu Yuexiang. Not only does she have a family tradition of learning, but she also has a gifted voice. One song from her can amaze everyone. Among the female performers of late, she can truly be called outstanding. She currently belongs to the Era Theater and is already recognized and praised. In the past, the little girl inevitably had a bit of a pretentious air because she was not deeply involved in the world. Now, she has completely changed her attitude. Whether it is treating people or handling affairs, she is always polite and courteous. Therefore, there are also many people who support her. It can be seen that when performing opera, the content must be genuine, and personal relationships must also be paid attention to. Last Saturday night, she performed "Ascending to Heaven" and the complete "Catching Cao, Releasing Cao" (from the court to the inn). Performing two such difficult and tiring plays at the same time is not easy to find among female performers today. Therefore, when "Ascending to Heaven" first appeared on stage, everyone applauded spontaneously. Yue Di was also particularly energetic that night. Her singing was full of ups and downs, and every note resonated in the clouds. The flavor was mellow and rich. The rapid triple beat, in three-three time, at three o'clock and three minutes, was accomplished in one breath, like a waterfall hanging from a cliff, rushing down thousands of miles, without showing any signs of exhaustion or hoarseness. It was truly commendable. In "Catching Cao, Releasing Cao," her slow singing when listening to his words and her original singing in the inn were sweet and clear, like pearls rolling on a jade plate. The whole play was full of wonderful melodies, which were enough to evoke deep emotions and dispel all worries. The audience applauded every sentence, so calling her an "iron voice, steel throat" is not an exaggeration. Her acting is also free and easy to watch. It is a pity that her pronunciation is still not strong enough, and her dialogue has a slightly feminine tone, which is a bit of a flaw. However, flaws do not obscure the jade, and we should not be too critical. Given time, she will surely reach perfection. In short, Yue Di is a newly discovered piece of beautiful jade. Cutting and polishing still needs a good craftsman, and diligent study and research are promising for Yue Di. Yue Di, please strive for it.

(10) Shanghai Opera

Shanghai opera used to be an art form appreciated only by some native Shanghainese, but in recent years, it has "no distinction between north and south." The ladies and gentlemen living in Shanghai all love to run to Shanghai opera theaters. The reason is simply that it is easy to understand and popular.

Some short comedies that make jokes, like "Comparing Begonias," which depict the innocent feelings of young children, are very thought-provoking.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Because of Ju Peng's popularity, I think of Guan Dayuan's decline.

In recent years, the performers who have been singing repeatedly are none other than Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Yang Shisen, and the junior Ma Lianliang Li Shengzao, the junior Li Shengzao Sha Shixin... Everyone knows that Shanghainese have an old problem of loving novelty. As the saying goes, "A new toilet will be fragrant for three days." It's no wonder everyone feels that the above-mentioned people are too poor and not rare enough. Ju Peng has not come to Shanghai for ten years. In terms of his qualifications and seniority, he can be considered the oldest ancestor of learning Tan among the above-mentioned people. Moreover, his prices are lower than Ma and Tan's. At the same time, he also brought a newly emerging Hou Yulan, an old beardsman who has become new, and a brand new female performer. As a result, the Shanghainese went wild. In addition, the Golden Theater's publicity was effective. Every day, the newspapers published words such as "half a month reservation," so the audience became more and more crowded. According to many people, Ju Peng has been getting "stage laughs" almost every day since he took the stage, when singing, acting, and swinging his headdress. Even in "Er Jin Gong," he actually got a full house of stage laughs (stage laughs are a kind of tolerant ridicule, different from booing and heckling). The ending of that sentence should have gone up, but because Ju Peng was weak, he had a bit of a yellow accent, as if the spring of a record player had loosened, so he got a big stage laugh. However, it was instantly silent, which proves that the audience was very tolerant of his decline. Everyone felt compassion and love for him, and couldn't bear to make him too embarrassed. Therefore, Ju Peng's popularity this time (in terms of box office) is actually due to the words "old brand."

When it comes to the existing Tan school beardsmen who can sell the old brand, even Shu Yan and Xiao Pei, including them, can't sell as well as Guan Shengyi's eldest son, Guan Dayuan. When Lao Tan and Liu Hongsheng had not yet retired from the opera stage in the early years of the Republic of China, Dayuan was already famous. Although he is eight or nine years younger than Xiaochen, the timing of their fame is about the same. Therefore, thirty years ago, "Old Scheme Gains Advantage" and "Baida Company" had recorded their "Crying Spirit Tablet" and "Pan Guan" and other records. From this, it can be proved that if he had not been famous very early, he would never have been asked by the record company to record. As for his experience of learning art since childhood, I will describe it briefly as follows. — (64) —

### Introducing "The Three Musketeers"

The New China Company's annual production of the slapstick comedy "The Three Musketeers" is scheduled to be screened at the Jincheng Theater this Saturday. It stars the three treasures Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, and Liu Jiqun, who play chivalrous musketeers who eradicate evil and support the good, with loyalty shining in their hearts. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the performance is hilariously突梯, making people laugh until their stomachs hurt. Imitating Liu, Guan, and Zhang in the bamboo forest, they wear opera costumes and swear brotherhood. The three of them drive a broken-down Austin around the world. Yellow cattle pull the car, patrolling the downtown area. The musketeers turn into ghosts and fall into the beauty trap. The three treasures perform all kinds of anecdotes vividly, not at all inferior to the Western Laurel and Hardy and other comedy stars. The film is directed by Chen Yiqing and took seven months to produce. There are also dozens of stars, such as Zhang Zhizhi, assisting in the performance. Its value is certainly not comparable to ordinary crudely made slapstick comedies.

Due to space limitations today, "Chess Garden" will be suspended for one day. (Editor)
