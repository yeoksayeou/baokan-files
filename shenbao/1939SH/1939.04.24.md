Editorial

### The Obligation to Pay Taxes

Recently, in the local news columns of Shanghai newspapers, there have been occasional discussions of stamp taxes and income taxes. Although I am not thoroughly familiar with the current tax situation in Shanghai, I feel compelled to offer some general reflections.

Most people do not clearly understand the nature of taxation. Consequently, they often equate government taxation with official extortion, and see their personal tax payment as akin to being skimmed off in a gambling pool. It is not that they do not recognize the legality of taxation, but in their minds “legality” is nearly synonymous with “coercive authority.” Nor is it that they do not accept that paying taxes is a duty—in their view, performing a duty is almost the same as suffering an injustice. These misconceptions have complex roots and cannot be corrected overnight. Therefore, new taxes are very difficult to implement effectively; Shanghai’s stamp tax has long been notorious for its difficulty, and the even newer income tax faces greater resistance still. Moreover, in these extraordinary times, though the legal basis for taxation in Shanghai remains unchanged, the perception of government authority and coercion, or of tax duties as grievances, differs from the past. Hence, revenue from stamp and income taxes has sharply declined.

What I wish to emphasize is the fundamental point that while the government is represented by officials, government and officials are not the same; and taxation and extortion are not synonymous. Citizens have a legal obligation to pay taxes, but fulfilling that duty is not realized through government authority or official coercion, but through the spontaneous sense of responsibility of the people. Authority and coercion by officials become necessary only because people fail to perform their duties. Thus, in times of peace, government authority and official enforcement go unchallenged, and people dutifully comply—this is taken for granted. But in exceptional circumstances, when government authority and enforcement falter, yet people still fulfill their obligations, that is the truest sign of patriotism. This spirit is not limited to taxation alone. In matters of national unity, it is not solely the armed forces that preserve unity at all times, but the entire populace’s heartfelt support; in legal governance, it is not only the courts enforcing laws, but the willingness of all citizens to abide by the rule of law; in loyalty to leadership and obedience to central authority, it is not coercion that matters but voluntary support and obedience of the people. In each case, these outcomes arise not from authority or coercion, but from a sense of duty.

The concept of duty has an intrinsic moral value far beyond coercion. If a task is carried out only under coercion, without any sense of duty, it is done reluctantly, concerned only with its burdens, not its significance. Why? Because there is no sense of duty. Those unaware of duty pay taxes only under coercion; once conquered, they become docile subjects, forced to pay tribute to foreign rulers just as they did to their own state. Patriotic citizens, however, when they retain their freedom, do not feel coerced in their payments but fulfill their obligations willingly. Duty is not determined by circumstances; the relationship between state and citizen can be compared to that of husband and wife. The husband owes duties to his wife, and the wife owes fidelity to her husband—this is duty. Such duties must be upheld even when the couple are apart; the husband owes his responsibilities even when powerless, the wife her fidelity even when absent. If, when the husband is weak, the wife fails to remain faithful, or vice versa, their relationship cannot endure. The same is true of state and citizen. If, when the state’s power wanes, citizens fail to perform their duties, that is a disgrace to the people and a betrayal of patriotism.

In view of the above, though Shanghai citizens have repeatedly demonstrated patriotism, reports of sharply falling tax revenues reveal a contradiction that cannot resolve itself. Are there still those who confuse government taxation with official extortion and lack an inner sense of tax obligation?

### Chinese Society for Land Administration Holds Fifth Annual Meeting; Over Seventy Attendees; President Chiang Delivers Encouragement

(Chongqing) The fifth annual meeting of the Chinese Society for Land Administration opened in Chongqing at 8 a.m. on the 23rd, chaired by the society’s director, Xiao Zheng. Minister Chen Lifu addressed the gathering, noting that land administration is fundamental to achieving local autonomy. Tasks such as population surveys, conscript training, land registration, reclamation of wasteland, development of transportation and production all depend on the careful research of the delegates to guide government policy. At 2 p.m., the first plenary session discussed China’s postwar land policy. On the morning of the 24th, the second plenary session will address land and economic reconstruction in Southwest China, with the closing ceremony in the afternoon. (23rd dispatch)

(Chongqing) On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese Society for Land Administration held its opening ceremony for the fifth annual meeting at Sichuan East Normal School. Presided over by director Xiao Zheng, President Chiang delivered an address of encouragement. The Central Executive Committee sent Minister of Social Affairs Chen Lifu to the meeting, and representatives from the Ministries of Education and Interior also attended. Land administration agencies from each province were represented, bringing detailed reports. As of last night, over seventy individuals had registered, including noted figures such as Ji Yu, Zhu Zongliang and Li Jinglu, along with more than ten institutional members. Special delegates in attendance included Zeng Jikuan, Academic Dean of the National Northwest Agricultural College; Gao Xin, Director of the Guangdong Land Administration Bureau; Tang Qiyu, Director of the Jiangxi Reclamation Office; Zhu Ping, Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial Land Reporting Office; Tang Huisun, Director of the Yunnan Reclamation District of the West China Reclamation Company; and Zhang Daochun, representing the Shaanxi Provincial Civil Affairs Department. The society received over fifty papers and essays, which have been compiled into conference proceedings and special publications, providing valuable reference for future land administration research. In his address, President Chiang quoted from the Book of Rites: “Goods that the evil man loathes to abandon on the ground need not be hoarded for oneself; powers that one loathes not to exert upon the body need not be used for oneself.” These words capture the essence of developing land resources and maximizing livelihood benefits. The party’s principle of equal land rights, as proclaimed in its founding program under the National Reconstruction Guidelines, and the concrete methods laid out in the Local Autonomy Implementation Law, demonstrate that land is the foundation of the people’s livelihood and must be used and distributed effectively. Monopolization of land leads to neglect, social inequality and hampers economic progress. Only by wholeheartedly studying and devising sound policies can we ensure that the plowman never lacks his tool, fulfilling the decades-long party advocacy on land reform. This will not only secure food and arms and aid the current war effort, but victory will present an excellent opportunity for thorough implementation of the land policies of the principle of livelihood. I urge you to respond to the times, examine good laws, carry out focused research and formulate concrete proposals. After this meeting, continue sectional studies. Outline overall plans, detail specific policy measures, draw on past lessons and offer practical methods. I hope you will diligently fulfill this mission. (22nd dispatch)

Xingji – On the southern section of the Tongpu railway, operations continue to proceed smoothly. Japanese forces in the areas of Hejin, Jingshan, Xinjiang, and Fencheng, repeatedly attacked by Chinese units, have concentrated their troops to hold defensive positions. The Japanese at Hejin are reportedly in a state of panic and have recently blocked off all mountain passes with stringent security measures. Fierce fighting persists east of the railway line. Japanese troops from Linfen attempted to reinforce eastward but were intercepted northwest of Fushan by a Chinese detachment. Over 700 Japanese infantry and cavalry reinforcements dispatched from Linfen were engaged in four hours of combat, leaving more than 100 Japanese dead. The exhausted Japanese then withdrew southward. Chinese units are now coordinating a sweeping operation in the Fushan area. (23rd dispatch)

### Chinese Forces Recapture Wangyu

Earlier, on the morning of the 18th, more than 300 Japanese soldiers attacked Luohan but were intercepted from multiple directions by Chinese units, encircled on three sides, and engaged in six hours of chaotic fighting, leaving over 100 bodies on the field. Survivors scattered around Zhongli, still seeking to operate.

The Japanese disintegrated and fled in disarray. At dawn on the 19th, Chinese units launched surprise attacks on Japanese forces in Wenshui and Jiaocheng, achieving further success. More than ten breaches were made in the Wenjiao highway by Chinese demolition teams, severing Japanese communications and causing great alarm. The Japanese holding the Xinyi area have been under sustained attack by Chinese forces for several days and have suffered heavy casualties. On the night of the 19th, Japanese units launched a two‑pronged assault on Yangpo and Yinjia but were engaged in all‑day fierce fighting by a Chinese unit and ultimately failed, retreating back to Xinyi.

### Two Major European Diplomatic Efforts: Tireless Maneuvering for Influence; Small Countries Assure Germany They Feel No Threat; Hitler to Use This to Deflect Roosevelt

(Berlin) Germany is now planning a powerful diplomatic campaign, especially in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, aimed at consolidating the totalitarian nations’ bloc and defeating the democratic “peace bloc.” Senior officers from Germany, Italy, and Spain are said to be convening a general staff conference, though this has not yet been confirmed. German officials admit that they have discussed President Roosevelt’s peace proposal with the relevant countries. The National Socialist Party also acknowledges that Führer Hitler intends to use the small countries’ replies to Germany as his response to President Roosevelt at the Reichstag session scheduled for April 28. (23rd AP)

(Berlin) Observers here have claimed that in his address to the Reichstag on the 28th, Hitler, replying to President Roosevelt, will declare that Europe’s small nations have assured him they feel no threat from Germany. Romania’s Foreign Minister Qiafengge, when consulting Germany recently, officially stated that if his country’s border security and sovereign independence are guaranteed—regardless of the guarantor—they would be welcome. Hitler is also expected to assert that bilateral agreements are more effective than multilateral ones, though such a policy in the Balkans has been obstructed by the Balkan Entente. Consequently, Germany and Italy plan to act together in this region, seeking to draw Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Hungary into an Axis group to undermine the Entente. When Yugoslavia’s Foreign Minister Markovitch visited Berlin before the 26th, German authorities certainly urged concrete cooperation with Germany and Italy; Germany is the primary market for Yugoslav exports, accounting for fifty percent of them. In the future, a conference of Danubian and Balkan nations backing the Axis might be convened, though this remains uncertain. (23rd Havas)

(London) Speculation has begun here about what stance Hitler will take next Friday when replying to President Roosevelt’s appeal for peace. According to information obtained by Reuters’s diplomatic correspondent, aside from the outlook for German‑Polish relations, there is little basis for firm conclusions. The Sunday Times’s correspondent in Warsaw reports that Germany plans to apply significant diplomatic pressure on Poland to prevent it from aligning with the Western powers. (23rd Reuters)

(Warsaw) Partial mobilization in Poland is still underway, with estimated daily costs exceeding 40,000 pounds sterling. Residents of the Free City of Danzig expect its status to change soon, but Polish public opinion remains entirely unwilling to make concessions. Ethnic Germans in Poland have been arrested for offenses against the state. Estonian Army Commander‑in‑Chief General Letonna arrived in Warsaw on Tuesday for talks with Polish General Staff officials; originally scheduled to depart today, he has extended his stay to April 24. (22nd Reuters)

(Paris) Since the German government instructed its envoys in European capitals to inquire whether their host nations felt threatened by Germany, local political circles have commented that Berlin is essentially seeking certificates of “good neighborliness” from each small state to thwart Anglo‑French efforts to form an anti‑aggression bloc. This tactic is likely to backfire. The Soviet government’s counterproposal to Britain yesterday advocated mutual security commitments explicitly targeting Germany. Should the small countries now declare absolute confidence in Germany, they would remove any need to join collective security arrangements. Germany’s line of questioning thus aims to forestall these alliances. The British and French have seen through this strategy and, while they continue to seek Soviet cooperation to maintain European order, they do not demand guarantees from small states that they cannot provide—such demands would only expose them to greater threats. Moreover, Italy is working to draw Yugoslavia and Hungary into its orbit, and Germany is active in Turkey, both aiming to undermine the Balkan Entente. Yet Romania and Greece are firmly guaranteed by Britain and France, and Turkey is in active negotiations with them, so Germany’s efforts are unlikely to prevail. In short, Britain and France are fully aware of all Axis maneuvers and will not ignore them. (22nd Havas)

### Various Countries Submit Replies to Germany

Athens – Prime Minister Medaxasas told a Havas reporter that the German government inquired whether Greece felt threatened by Germany. “I replied that our country has never been threatened by yours, and there is no concern for our friendly diplomatic relations,” he said. Rumors that Bulgaria harbors territorial ambitions are groundless. (22nd Havas)

Belgrade – Officials here declare that Germany did not formally ask Yugoslavia whether it felt threatened, but their envoy Ambassador Hiren did seek opinions informally. Since Germany annexed Austria and thus became Yugoslavia’s neighbor, bilateral relations have improved. (23rd Havas)

Helsinki – The German government posed two questions to Finland: (1) whether it had prior knowledge of President Roosevelt’s telegram to Germany and Italy, and (2) whether Finland felt threatened by Germany. The Finnish government replied that it had not been threatened and was unaware of Roosevelt’s telegram in advance. (23rd Havas)

Stockholm – German Minister Prince Witt, citing President Roosevelt’s telegram, asked Foreign Minister Sandler whether Sweden felt threatened by Germany. Sandler immediately replied, “No.” No official communique is expected. (23rd Havas)

### Netherlands Determined to Defend Its Independence

The Hague – Political circles here have declared that the Dutch nation, known for its courage and endowed with patriotic zeal and creative spirit, is determined at any cost to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This stance is the strongest barrier against aggression. Should the threat of war become more pronounced, the government stands ready to place the country under a wartime regime. The colonies will assist in manpower and supplies—especially petroleum—to support national defense. Military observers estimate that full mobilization would field a well‑trained army of some 300,000. Although the Dutch fortifications cannot match France’s Maginot Line, the country’s extensive inland waterways form natural barriers; in an emergency, large areas can be flooded within hours to halt an enemy advance. (22nd Havas)

### Britain, France, and Germany Pursue Diplomatic and Economic Measures Toward Romania; Romanian Foreign Minister Travels to London

(London) The Times reports that Britain’s security guarantee to Romania is unilateral and does not envisage a mutual defense pact. Additionally, the British government has dispatched an economic mission to negotiate with Romanian authorities and may extend a credit of £2.5 million, though this remains unconfirmed. (23rd Havas)

(Bucharest) The British commercial delegation is due here on Monday. Meanwhile, the Germans are pressing to implement the recently signed German‑Romanian economic agreement, putting Bucharest’s officials and business community in a difficult position. Huldart, who led the German economic mission for that agreement, has returned here, joined by two German business delegations of fifteen members each. Today’s news indicates that the German automotive engineer Bischsgna will arrive soon to study the feasibility of constructing military roads. Under the agreement, a joint German‑Romanian company has been formed to develop oil fields; the first region has been designated, and five Romanian representatives departed today for Berlin to survey methods for adjusting Romanian commercial operations in Czechoslovakia. (22nd Reuters)

(Bucharest) French petroleum representative Vinje signed a contract on the 31st with Romanian Economy Minister Puirihua, under which Romania will sell France 700,000 tons of petroleum annually. He then concluded an additional contract for 400,000 tons of petroleum and by‑products, to be delivered by March 31, 1940. Under these agreements, Romania will receive 500 million francs in cash—equivalent to one‑quarter of its annual petroleum export value. Political circles here comment that foreign powers’ attempts to expand their influence in Romania’s oil industry will be checked. Presently, ninety percent of Romania’s oil sector is controlled by British, French, Belgian, and American interests. (22nd Havas)

(Bucharest) Romanian Foreign Minister Qiafengge held talks last night at Lugoj with Ambassador Dattelesco, concluding early this morning. He then boarded a ship for consultations in Britain. Ambassador Dattelesco has returned to Paris. (23rd Havas)

(Brussels) Romanian Foreign Minister Qiafengge completed his consultations here last night and departed for London. Before leaving, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pierlot hosted a farewell banquet for him, attended by Economy Minister Sabro and the Romanian Minister to Belgium, Radulesco. (23rd Maritime Telegraph)

(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Qiafengge is expected to arrive in London on Sunday afternoon, where British Foreign Secretary Halifax will meet him at Victoria Station. The two will begin talks on Monday morning, with Britain’s guarantee to Romania a key agenda item. (22nd Reuters)

### Nordic Countries Determined to Remain Neutral

Stockholm – Prime Minister Hansson declared today that the peoples of the Scandinavian countries will maintain strict neutrality should a war erupt among the great powers. (23rd Reuters)

Stockholm – Today marks the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Swedish Social Democratic Party. Its leader, Prime Minister Hansson, delivered a speech stating that, given the present European situation, the nation unanimously advocates a policy of neutrality. “Our country supports international cooperation but opposes joining any alliance,” he said. Above all, Sweden will remain neutral to avoid being drawn into the vortex of international conflict. All Nordic nations share this aspiration and will assist each other to overcome the difficulties arising from the international crisis. (23rd Havas)

### U.S. Resolves to Provide Ample Financial Aid to Britain and France; Economists Predict They Can Sustain for Two Years

(Washington) Treasury experts have submitted a report to President Roosevelt outlining measures should war break out in Europe. Key recommendations include: (1) If war erupts suddenly, suspend trading on exchanges for several days to allow markets to stabilize. (2) If the European situation deteriorates, the U.S. government, under the “business as usual” principle, will ensure that gold flows among Washington, London, and Paris remain uninterrupted, maintaining existing currency agreements. Furthermore, if Britain and France wish to draw on assets held by their citizens in the U.S., the Treasury will facilitate such transfers, although congressional approval of a special bill will be required. Economist Gardiner, writing in the Wall Street Journal, expressed optimism that Britain and France—holding substantial gold and dollar reserves in the U.S.—will not face immediate financial shortages. They can import necessary war materials for two years without borrowing, and having already stockpiled large quantities of food and armaments, they are well prepared and unlikely to panic as they did in 1914. (22nd Havas)

(Washington) President Roosevelt today authorized the War Department to place orders with six private factories for various military supplies, both to train workers and to ready the facilities for conversion to armaments production if needed. The factories will install machinery and equipment for manufacturing gas masks, semi‑automatic rifles, searchlights, antiaircraft gun components, and dual‑purpose 75mm shells, among other items. (22nd Havas)

(Washington) The punitive duties on German imports to the United States took effect last night. These duties aim to penalize Germany for violating American neutrality and engaging in aggression in Europe. It is expected that German exports to the U.S. will come to a complete standstill. Over the past two weeks, large shipments of German goods were sent to the U.S. in an attempt to evade these duties. (23rd AP)

### China, Having Already Ordered Large Batches of Aircraft from the U.S., Also Buying Massive Quantities of Military Uniform Cloth; Contract Signed for Fifty-Four High‑Speed Aircraft; Further Purchase of Twenty Million Yards of Madayuan Cloth from Manchester

(New York) Regarding the New York Times report that China is purchasing US$7–15 million worth of fighter planes from the United States, the Chinese Embassy in Washington professes ignorance and the American Aircraft Materials Export Company declines to comment. According to an Associated Press investigation, two weeks ago a representative of United Aircraft, Pederson, signed a contract in Chongqing with Dr. H. H. Kung, China’s Minister of Finance. After Pederson’s return to the United States, he met in Los Angeles with Mr. Neitman of the American Aircraft Materials Export Company and with officials of the China Aviation Power Company. In addition to fifty‑four high‑speed Seversky single‑seat fighters, the deal includes aircraft materials valued at some US$3–4 million and an unspecified number of Ryan trainers for novice pilots. (23rd, AP dispatch)

Manchester—According to last night’s local reports, the Chinese government intends to purchase twenty million yards of military uniform cotton cloth from various mills here, at a cost of about £500,000. It is said the government has already placed an order for £30,000 worth of uniform cloth. (23rd, AP dispatch)


### Anti‑Aggression Front: Does It Include the Far East? Heated Discussions in London and Paris; Soviet Ambassador to Britain Returns to His Post

(London) Whether the Far East will be included in the Anglo‑French‑Soviet anti‑aggression pact remains a matter of speculation. According to reports from Paris, none of the information received here yesterday has been confirmed. Commentators generally expect that once Soviet Ambassador Maisky returns to London, Prime Minister Chamberlain may outline the progress of the negotiations early this week. (23rd, Reuters dispatch)

(Paris) After two days’ study of the Soviet counter‑proposal, Britain and France have decided to set aside for now a broad collective security plan and instead seek to form a tripartite alliance with the Soviet Union. It is said the Soviets wish the United States to be included in a collective security system for the Far East, and Americans, eager to secure their markets there, would be unlikely to refuse such an arrangement. France, however, is less optimistic about American participation. (23rd, AP dispatch)

(Paris) Prime Minister Daladier yesterday discussed the Soviet counter‑proposal with Foreign Minister Bonnet. Bonnet then promptly summoned Soviet Ambassador Suritz, who urged that France reply to the Soviet proposal as soon as possible. (23rd, Havas dispatch)

(Moscow) British sources here report that Soviet Ambassador Maisky, after returning from London on official duties yesterday afternoon, held talks with Britain’s Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps. The contents remain undisclosed. Ambassador Maisky is scheduled to depart again early tomorrow morning to convey the Soviet government’s views on the anti‑aggression bloc to the British authorities. (23rd, Havas dispatch)

(London) Well‑informed political circles here claim that Britain’s implementation of limited conscription has become inevitable and the Cabinet is expected to make a firm decision within the next week. Sir William Strang, a government foreign policy adviser who spoke in Paris with the French authorities, has returned to report to Foreign Secretary Halifax that French public opinion is astonished Britain has not yet introduced conscription under the current circumstances. In addition, Lieutenant‑General Sir John Gort, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, has told Prime Minister Chamberlain that without bolstering the army, Britain will be unable to fulfill its recently accepted military obligations. Meanwhile, the War Office has begun recruiting volunteers to double the reserve forces, but results have been disappointing, making it clear that conscription can no longer be postponed. (22nd, Havas dispatch)

(Paris) The right‑wing French Social Research Party convened an extraordinary meeting here. Its leader, Colonel Raoul‑Lacour, spoke, warning that if war breaks out France should not cooperate militarily with the Soviet Union, which should at most supply raw materials and semi‑finished goods. Contrary to rumors of advanced Soviet weaponry, American aviator Colonel Lindbergh last year pointed out the poor quality of Soviet aircraft. Once war begins, the Soviets would deploy most of their forces against Japan, having neither the time nor the capacity to aid France. Moreover, Romania and Poland would not permit Soviet troops to enter their territories. Thus, Soviet troops cannot venture abroad, and material aid cannot be relied upon. France’s only recourse is to import raw materials and semi‑finished goods while maintaining a benevolent neutrality toward the Soviet Union—this should set the limit of any Soviet assistance. (22nd, Havas dispatch)


### Italian Troops in Spain to Withdraw Next Month

Madrid—Officials here report that Germany’s Condor Legion and the Italian volunteer “Corps” are scheduled to withdraw in the latter half of next month. The weapons they used—aircraft, anti‑aircraft guns, tanks, transports, and rifles—have been purchased by the Nationalist government in cash and will remain in Spain. (22nd, Havas dispatch)

Burgos—Authorities here declare that all rumors of foreign troops entering Spain are false, as are reports concerning Gibraltar and Tangier. These baseless stories serve ulterior motives. In truth, Spain has resolved to focus solely on its great task of national reconstruction. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)


### Hungarian Authorities to Visit Berlin

Budapest—Last night it was announced that representatives of German and Hungarian industry will meet in early May to discuss how to eliminate trade barriers between the two countries. The greatest current obstacle is the distorted trade balance: Hungary supplies Germany with large quantities of agricultural products whose value far exceeds the industrial goods it imports from Germany. The aim of these talks is to find improvements that protect Hungarian agriculture without harm. (21st, Havas dispatch)

Budapest—According to local reports, Prime Minister Darányi and Foreign Minister Sárközy will depart on the 28th of this month for Berlin. They are to hold separate talks with Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and are expected to stay in Berlin for four days. (23rd, Havas dispatch)


### Japan Utterly Bankrupt, Forcing People to Save; Many Tokyo Women Reluctant to Serve as Nurses; Shortage of Ordinary Factory Workers

(Tokyo) In the last fiscal year, Japan’s Ministry of Finance launched a national savings campaign, aiming for ¥8 billion daily to fund the enormous costs of the China war and to support industrial expansion. So far, the total saved is ¥7.2 billion—still short of the target. Public subscriptions to government bonds have been disappointing, prompting the authorities to issue an additional ¥500 million in banknotes, further driving up prices. This year the government asks citizens to save ¥100 billion to cover ¥60 billion in government bonds and ¥40 billion for industrial expansion. The Mainichi Shimbun warns this amount may still be insufficient, estimating bond issues alone could reach ¥75 billion. The paper urges the government to adopt stronger measures to boost savings and avert harmful inflation. The Kokumin Shimbun reports that the Finance Minister plans to enforce compulsory savings in the 95,000 munitions‑related factories across Japan, deducting a fixed sum from the pay of any employee earning above prewar wages. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Official surveys show that of Tokyo’s 33,205 qualified female nurses, only 22,618 are practicing. The remaining 10,587, though urgently needed, have left nursing for marriage or other work, or remain idle due to low pay. With dysentery and other illnesses spreading this spring, authorities hope to remedy the nursing shortage by relaxing the strict qualifying exams to encourage more women to enter the profession. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Due to the war in China, Japan’s merchant fleet faces severe crew shortages. Newspaper classifieds are filled with requests for sailors. The Education Ministry is tapping maritime schools to train naval personnel. The navy still needs an estimated 1,000 new officers. Overall, Japanese merchant seamen now fill only 70 percent of the demand. Similar shortages afflict other factories and shops; munitions factories, offering better pay, attract workers away from ordinary factories, causing panic among non‑defense industry workers. Still, Japan added one million tons of merchant shipping last year. (23rd, Reuters dispatch)


### Soviet Invention: New‑Type Aircraft

(Moscow) A new sports aircraft designed by Soviet engineer Shelomeytin has been test‑flown by Soviet hero Golovin. Reportedly of excellent quality and significant for aviation sports, the aircraft is a long‑wing monoplane powered by a single 40‑horsepower motor yet able to fly up to 5,000 kilometers. (22nd, TASS dispatch)


### Palestine Question: Britain Asks Egypt to Mediate

(London) After the failure of the London Round Table Conference on Palestine, the British government, seeking a peaceful solution, has drafted a new plan entrusting Egypt to negotiate with Palestinian Arab representatives. Responsible sources here declare the plan has likely been accepted by the Arabs, and once international conditions stabilize, it will be published in the form of a white paper. At the same time, Britain is in talks with Jewish leaders to encourage their cooperation. Informed sources say the British proposal contains two main points: (1) Palestine is to enter a transitional period of several years before full independence; (2) during this period, there will be one Administrative Council and one Legislative Council jointly organized by Arabs and Jews; although Arabs will outnumber Jews, on matters affecting both communities, the Jewish representatives or the British High Commissioner will have a casting vote. Regarding Jewish immigration to Palestine, the British authorities regard it as a critical issue to be administratively resolved. (22nd, Havas dispatch)


### National Political Participation Congress Postponed

(Chongqing) The National Political Participation Congress, originally convening every three months, will hereafter meet every six months. The next session, initially scheduled for May, has been moved to August. (23rd, Reuters dispatch)


### Covenant Oath Ceremony

(Hong Kong) On the morning of the 23rd, teachers and staff of the Hong Kong Chinese community held a National Covenant Oath ceremony at Wan Chai’s Tung Chi College, supervised by Chan Chak and Lo Yik‑kwan. (23rd dispatch)


### Forty‑Four Foreigners Depart Hankou

(Hankou) Forty‑four foreigners (including men, women, and children) who have long planned to leave for Shanghai and Jiujiang will board the American ships “USS Isabel” and “USS Arkaba” today. Most are Americans, but the party also includes Russians, Swedes, and Norwegians. (23rd, AP dispatch)


### Roosevelt, Son of Former U.S. President, Arrives in Chongqing

(Chongqing) Today, Quentin Roosevelt, son of former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, flew in from Lanzhou. According to Mr. Roosevelt, his trip to China is to collect materials for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. When asked by an AP reporter about Soviet influence in Lanzhou, he said he made no special investigation but observed there was no unusual Soviet presence there. (23rd, AP dispatch)


### Government to Restrict Government‑Funded Overseas Students

(Chongqing) Today the Chinese government announced it will limit the number of government‑funded students studying abroad. The new regulation aims to reduce consumption of China’s foreign exchange reserves and to cultivate specialists in military, mechanical, scientific, and medical fields needed during and after the war. Henceforth, students who are not pursuing these subjects must be recalled or have their stipends suspended, except in cases of exceptional academic achievement. Since the outbreak of war, the number of Chinese students abroad has fallen dramatically—from 894 in 1936 to 360 in 1937, and just 59 last year. (23rd, AP dispatch)


### South China Morning Post: Central News Agency Ordered to Cease Providing Articles

(Hong Kong) The Central News Agency’s Hong Kong branch has been ordered to stop supplying articles to the South China Morning Post as of the 23rd. (23rd dispatch)


### A Certain Theater in Hanyang Bombed – Many Casualties

(Hankou) Today a Hanyang theater, reopened under Japanese patronage, was bombed, resulting in numerous casualties. A Russian conductor and two Filipino musicians hired for the reopening were also injured, though their wounds are not serious. No Japanese patrons were harmed. (23rd, AP dispatch)


### Italy Courting Yugoslavia to Join Anti‑Communist Bloc and Improve Relations with Hungary

(Belgrade) Some 10,000 youths from various Yugoslav organizations and parties held a rally at the university today, passing a resolution favoring a democratic national government and urging it not to hide secret contacts with aggressor states under the guise of neutrality. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)

(Belgrade) Political observers expect Germany and Italy to invite Yugoslavia to join an anti‑communist bloc, signaling their desire that Yugoslavia not join the Anglo‑French anti‑aggression front. They predict that during Foreign Minister Marković’s visit to Berlin on April 26, Germany will apply pressure. However, responsible sources here doubt Yugoslavia will allow itself to be drawn into such a vortex. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)

(Venice) After talks between Italy’s Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslavia’s Foreign Minister Marković, a joint communique stated that, in light of the international situation and the recent events in Albania, the two countries discussed all related issues. It affirmed their special friendship and agreed that Yugoslavia should develop sincere political and economic cooperation with Italy and work closely with Germany. It also opened a path to better understanding between Yugoslavia and Hungary. (23rd, Havas dispatch)

(Venice) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković and Italy’s Foreign Minister Ciano met for two and a half hours, then toured by motor launch and attended a banquet hosted by Ciano that evening. Responsible sources say the two discussed Europe’s political situation and exchanged views on matters of direct mutual interest. In an interview with the semi‑official Italian news agency Stefani, Marković said relations between the neighboring countries are rooted in common ground. His visit to Ciano was a routine matter intended to reaffirm mutual trust. (22nd, Havas dispatch)

(Rome) Commenting on the talks between Foreign Ministers Ciano and Marković, Premier Mussolini’s spokesman Gaeta wrote in the Italian daily Popolo d’Italia that the discussions could yield two outcomes: (1) Yugoslavia might soon join the anti‑Communist International, drawing closer to the Berlin‑Rome axis; (2) it could also sign a friendship treaty with Hungary. (23rd, Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković is now in Venice meeting with Italy’s Foreign Minister Ciano. Berlin newspapers lead with this news, variously headlining it “Extremely Cordial Talks” or “Yugoslavia Maintains Good‑Neighbor Policy.” The Lokal Anzeiger reports Marković will soon visit Berlin. The Börsen‑Zeitung, citing Rome, says the two foreign ministers had three purposes: (1) to discuss Italy’s pending reply to President Roosevelt’s telegraph, with Ciano seeking to understand a neighbor’s views; (2) to discuss issues concerning the Danube region and the Balkans; (3) to plan steps following Italy’s annexation of Albania toward closer ties with Yugoslavia. The Deutsche Tageszeitung adds that once Marković visits Berlin to hold talks with German authorities, he will proceed to Budapest to sign a consultation agreement; Bulgaria is also said to be ready to join. The Volkswart calls Marković’s imminent trip to Berlin evidence of Germany and Italy’s united policy on the Danube region and the Balkans. (23rd, Havas dispatch)

### The Rebirth of Changsha

— Changren

After Scorched Earth, a Brand‑New Appearance / Buildings Rapidly Rebuilt, People Returning

Changsha dispatch. On the highway from Hengyang to Changsha, only a handful of military vehicles move. At the ferry crossing near Xiangtan—on the eve of Changsha’s great fire—over six hundred vehicles once jostled here awaiting the southward crossing; now only the one we occupy reaches the northern bank. The willows along the roadside and the peach blossoms before the villages almost smile at the farmers driving their oxen to spring plowing. The people of eastern Hunan and from all over the country are intensifying production to support the war and answer the enemy.

Though fierce battles have erupted along both banks of the Xiang River, the front at the Hunan‑Hubei border remains calm. In March, Changsha has already risen from scorched earth. Like the European cities after World War II as depicted by H. G. Wells in The Shape of Things to Come, the people, emerging from devastation, are reconstructing everything from the ruins. Yet it is not so desolate or bleak, for the great Chinese nation is supremely resilient and inventive. I saw Changsha burned only four months ago; now I behold its new face. I admire the courage of the Hunanese, who, barely a hundred kilometers from the front lines, are racing to build a new Changsha.

Once home to over sixty thousand dwellings and several hundred thousand people, Changsha, after the great fire, retained only some ten thousand houses and thirty thousand inhabitants scattered across the east, south, and north. Now new homes rise amid the rubble, and the population has multiplied tenfold, with returning residents still streaming back. Thatched and plank shacks form only a small fraction; well‑finished city houses with decorative doors are gradually increasing. Around South Zheng Road, all the shops one expects in a city are in place. Except for banks and pawnshops, jewelers now outnumber tobacco shops—remarkable though they are far less ostentatious. In fact, they have become Changsha’s financial masters, replacing banks and pawnshops: many people exchange their gold ornaments there for cash, using the proceeds to rebuild homes and businesses. Since society rests on economic foundations, the Central Bank’s Changsha branch will be established in early April. Changsha will undoubtedly grow stronger and more stable through these financial activities.

All the larger hotels were destroyed; in their place over four hundred “large hostels” have sprung up—Sanhe (“Three Harmonies”) is the largest, with thirty to forty rooms; most range from six to fourteen or fifteen rooms. The proprietors of these large hostels are, for the most part, fortunate small citizens with some property. Many shop clerks now happily fill the role of “tea hosts.” Almost every household is a shop, or at least maintains a stall in front. The appearances are quite respectable. Even in the best weather, city dwellers cannot forget air raids. Under Japanese military command, the “flying thieves” target peaceful civilians in crowded areas. Changsha’s more than two hundred thousand evacuated citizens cannot satisfy their bloodlust.

Old department stores sell their remaining stock under the label “temporary shops.” Here “temporary” means until new buildings are completed. New stores often adopt optimistic names reflecting people’s hopes for victory. Yet there are inevitably some “wavering elements”: one eatery called itself the Speculative Pavilion—I suspect its owner has already prepared to leave Changsha at any moment. Prices here are higher than in Hengyang, while in Guilin they are much lower. Most daily necessities come from Wenzhou, rarely from domestic factories. Many brands have sprung up overnight, and a number of trademarks bear hints of the “Red Sun.”

Electric lighting and telephones will soon be restored. Government offices and residences with essential telephone needs already have military lines. Four daily papers—Central Daily (broadsheet), Frontline Daily (four‑page), People’s Daily (small format), and New Citizen Evening News (eight pages)—are in circulation. Recently the papers organized charity sales to benefit troops at the front, with subscribers paying thirty yuan per copy.

Changsha’s night market, though less extensive than before, mirrors daytime crowds. Since electric lights are still being installed, a few shops jointly maintain kerosene street lamps every twenty or so houses; the streets are thus brighter than before. In secluded alleyways, residents group five households to set up a glass‑enclosed kerosene lamp: though dimmer, it greatly aids pedestrians. Some impoverished folks steal kerosene late at night—no light, just oil. On some lamps I have spotted humorous inscriptions in ink or chalk, such as “Back again?” or “Stealing oil—watch out for your wife!” Lamp owners mostly laugh it off, for by the time a kerosene lamp burns through the night, little oil remains to be stolen.

Prostitutes are parasites feeding off military and official circles. In wartime, some women, left without means of support, have been forced into this trade. The provincial government has designated several alleys—such as East Great Thatch Alley—for registered prostitutes, who hang green triangular lights outside their doors at night. But only one hundred and one registered, fearing too much exposure would hurt business. These alleys were once homes of the local elite; now they have been converted into restaurants and inns. In the guest registers of these inns, more than half the names read “Ms. Chen Yanqiu” or “Ms. Xiao Hongyu,” with the annotation “long stay”—a crafty form of advertisement. Before the Lunar New Year, playing cards in hotels was permitted; now it is forbidden. After the Changsha city government merged with the county government, the police bureau came under provincial authority, with a municipal affairs section handling urban administration; the county government manages military service, townships, mutual aid groups, relief funds, grain reserves, and so on. Previously, Changsha city drafted two hundred young men monthly and Changsha county one thousand. After the fire and population dispersal, returns have begun, and recruitment for the conscripts missing in November and December last year has started. The county originally had over a thousand mutual aid units and ninety thousand conscripts; now only seven hundred such units remain. On average, two men drawn per unit per month are sent to the front. To date, fourteen thousand men have been dispatched. The annual relief fund for families of the war dead amounts to over one hundred thousand yuan. However, due to frequent unit reassignments and changing designations, and because many officers have been transferred or killed, families of conscripts often cannot ascertain their loved ones’ fate or obtain proof of death to apply for relief. This issue, affecting future conscription management and common across the nation, should be addressed urgently. As for food, the fire caused massive losses, and with citizens scattered and many troops stationed locally, shortages have become problematic. The provincial and county governments are issuing passports to allow people to transport their rice stocks from neighboring counties for redistribution.

The Rice and Salt Monopoly Office has been reorganized into military‑civil cooperation stations. In northern Hunan there are four stations organized by the Political Department of the Ninth War Area and three by local civilian groups. Their main tasks are to procure fuel, rice, oil, and salt for passing troops, preventing soldiers from buying directly from civilians and causing trouble. Each station also maintains a transport detachment of dozens, composed of local students and conscripts, responsible for carrying wounded soldiers. But the army’s transport needs often exceed these detachments. Initially, the county government could provide dozens or even hundreds of carriers, no problem. Later, however, some units forbade carriers from returning home after reaching certain points, making recruitment difficult. The people often praise well‑supplied armies as good armies. When the 89th Division passed through Changsha, needing no civilian carriers, several farmers spoke highly of it. Yet when working locally, civilians readily volunteer; for example, thousands serve as carriers on Changsha’s nearby defensive works. Road and railway sabotage likewise relies largely on their efforts.

March in Changsha has already risen from scorched earth, for the great Chinese nation is the most resilient and inventive of peoples.

### The Process of the Chinese Army’s Recapture of Zengcheng / Zengcheng Retaken, Renewing the Threat to Guangzhou / Fierce Fighting Over Several Days Inflicts Heavy Casualties on Both Sides / Japanese Send Large Reinforcements but Are Also Repulsed

Hong Kong dispatch. Zengcheng, east of Guangzhou, west of Huiyang and Boluo, and north of Shilong station on the Canton–Kowloon Railway, commands the throat of traffic on Guangdong’s East River. It was the Japanese army’s only outer stronghold around Guangzhou. The Japanese, deeming the city crucial, deployed large forces inside and built formidable defenses around it, threatening the Bei River area and Conghua. Several months ago, the Chinese army’s fierce counteroffensive on the East River recovered Huiyang and Boluo and advanced on Shilong, directly threatening Guangzhou. However, because the Japanese garrison in Zengcheng held firm, the advance on Guangzhou stalled, and East River forces could do no more than maintain positions at Huiyang and Boluo. This spring, after reorganizing command and reinforcing weaponry, the East River Chinese army, in coordination with Guangdong’s northern forces, resumed attacks on Zengcheng. Unless this city fell, the Chinese would have no possibility of threatening Guangzhou. Yet for months the counterattacks made no progress, chiefly because Japanese‑held positions and unusually robust fortifications around Zengcheng made any assault difficult to succeed. Moreover, the Japanese garrison at Zengcheng and Shilong—numbering two to three thousand troops—was supported by fully mechanized units. Even if the Chinese broke through at one or two points, they dared not push deeply alone.

Only recently, as battles in Jiangmen and Xinhui intensified and the front expanded, Japanese forces had to be drawn away to reinforce those sectors, reducing the Zengcheng garrison. Still, a regiment‑sized force with mechanized troops and artillery remained. Sensing the moment, Chinese command detached two divisions from the Ninth and Twelfth Army Groups, advancing in northeastern prongs. Simultaneously, part of the East River guerrilla units joined. The northern prong advanced from Conghua; the eastern prong crossed the river clandestinely near Gouzitan. By the morning of the 13th, Chinese forces had captured outer positions at Zhuguling, Shetoulng, Jiaoshiling, and Pengwu, completing the encirclement of the inner defenses. That afternoon at six o’clock, both prongs launched simultaneous assaults on the city’s outskirts, pounding the walls. By the early hours of the 14th, Chinese units had reached Zengcheng’s East and North gates. The Japanese fell back within the walls, relying on the fortifications. But under relentless attack, they were driven to desperate last stands. Most of their force attempted a breakout under covering fire from heavy artillery but were repelled by the Chinese, suffering heavy casualties. Intense hand‑to‑hand combat raged. By dawn on the 14th, Japanese fatalities exceeded 400. At this point, the Guangzhou garrison received news and urgently dispatched a large detachment to reinforce Zengcheng and lift the siege. The advance party—four to five hundred infantry and artillery—met prepared Chinese positions on the morning of the 14th; fierce shelling from the previous night into morning repelled them. Inside Zengcheng, Japanese morale and combat power were exhausted. The Chinese then sent a civilian‑clad vanguard into the city for street fighting. Fires broke out across the walls, and with concentrated gunfire and artillery, by evening the entire Japanese garrison had been annihilated. Japanese casualties were severe; Chinese heroic losses were also not few.

### Guangdong Province—Comprehensive Military Chronicle of the Entire West River Line / Jiangmen and Xinhui Reduced to Guerrilla Warfare, Japanese Probing at Shanshuikou Eases / West River Chinese Forces to Launch Major Counterattack

Hong Kong dispatch. In early April, the battle for Jiangmen and Xinhui raged for several days, but disrupted communications left many reports unverified. Two days after Xinhui fell, I traveled from Macau by steamer past Bieyúshā to Shanshuikou, where I met the commander of a brigade in the First Guerrilla Zone. He provided a firsthand account of the battle at Xinhui and an overview of the military situation in the upper West River basin. I record the following as a true field chronicle:

Recollections of the Xinhui Battle

Xinhui’s fall was not due to any lack of bravery among its defenders, but to inferior weapons and overwhelming enemy strength. The garrison—fewer than three thousand men—comprised only the guerrilla units of Li Wuzhi and Zhou Hanling, part of Chi Zhongkuan’s Security Battalion, and local militia. From the first shots on North Street to the city’s fall, no regular army units joined the fight, for Xinhui and the Four Counties were designated a guerrilla zone, with guerrilla warfare as the chief tactic: small forces wearing down the enemy without large numbers. The entire front was divided into three segments: from Tangxia’s North Street to Shuinan (first segment), Jiangmen to Lile (second), and Gongzhou Road to Huicheng (third). In the first segment, centered on Shuinan, fierce fighting at the East Fort in Tangxia’s North Street lasted ten hours, destroying the fort and forcing defenders back to Shuinan, where after another full day of combat they retreated into Jiangmen. In the second segment, centered on Lile, as the first segment withdrew, no troops remained to defend Jiangmen; guerrilla units dispersed to the heights around the city, holding out another day and night while Japanese land, sea, and air forces bombarded Lile, destroying the village and Chinese positions, which then fell back to Huicheng. During the fiercest fighting, neither side entered Jiangmen, so no street battles occurred; only after Chinese forces withdrew from the outskirts did the Japanese occupy Jiangmen. Reports that the city changed hands twice are untrue. In the third segment at Huicheng, fighting raged another day and night under heavy air strikes and cavalry pursuit. Outnumbered, the Chinese held on nearly a week before withdrawing to new positions at Shanshuikou on the 6th. At that point, a fresh army corps arrived to relieve the guerrillas, taking turns holding the line. Currently, the vanguard still holds Daze, Siqian, Fenshui, and Jiangkou. Over ten days, the front has seen no major changes. Japanese casualties exceed 500; Chinese losses are only about a hundred. Fortunately, Jiangmen proper was spared scorched‑earth tactics, thanks to Li Wuzhi’s planning, earning the populace’s gratitude. Recently, wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported back to Guangzhou, where the China University Hospital and the North Army Hospital have been converted into convalescent centers. Military police now search households daily for youths aged fifteen to twenty for blood draws to transfuse the wounded, prompting most local youths to flee the city.

The Situation at Shanshuikou

Shanshuikou lies at the junction of Xinhui, Queshan, and Taishan counties, under Kaiping’s jurisdiction. It is eighty li east of Xinhui, seventy li south of Taishan, over sixty li west of Kaiping, and seventy li north of Heshan. It commands the highway through the four counties of Xin, Heshan, Kaiping, and Taishan, and river routes linking northward to Changsha, Xinchang, Dihai, and Sanbu, and southward to Macau, Yamen, Jiangmen, and Sanmen. Its convenient transport and thriving commerce make it one of the Four Counties’ trade hubs. If Shanshuikou falls, the Japanese can invade west toward Sanbu, south to Taishan, or circle north behind Heshan, imperiling Zhaoqing. After the Huicheng withdrawal, defenders rushed to fortify this position, and reinforcements gathered from all directions to hold it firmly. From the 10th to the 15th, Japanese forces repeatedly attacked from Huicheng toward Daze and Shanshuikou, aiming to break the road defenses and seize this stronghold, but were repulsed each time. After the 16th, the situation eased somewhat, as Japanese troops at Jiangmen were recalled to reinforce the increasingly tense fronts at Dongbei, Jianghua, Conghua, and Zengcheng, relieving pressure on the Four Counties. The Chinese now prepare a counterattack toward Xinhui, fixing Japanese forces and aiding the northern front’s troops.

Bandit Troubles in Muzhou Township

Muzhou lies upstream from Bieyúshā, the waterway that all vessels must traverse to reach Macau from Jiangmen and the Four Counties. After Xinhui fell, refugees—whether by ferry or hired boat—headed for Macau, but many were robbed or killed by bandits at Muzhou, losing clothes, silver, and jewelry. Refugees felt utterly helpless. Zhao Shibei, former head of the Guangzhou District Court and a Xinhui native, after dismissal settled in Limen. On the 12th, unable to find lodging in the countryside, he and his family and neighbors rented two covered boats for Macau, only to fall victim to bandits at Muzhou. Muzhou has long been plagued by brigands; though one pacification occurred years ago, current disorder has overwhelmed authorities, letting criminals exploit the chaos to pillage. Inland civilians, already suffering war, now face bandits with no refuge—a plight without end. Attacks on other river ferries continue to be reported.

Stability in the West River Military Situation

On the north bank of the West River, from Longshan through Jiujiang to the Sanshui River mouth, Japanese forces now occupy the territory. Yet the south bank, from Shaping in Heshan via Sanzhou, Gulou, Fuwan, Jinli to the Zhaoqing Gorge, shows no Japanese presence. According to a Heshan county official, since the Jiangmen battles began, there has been no fighting in the Shaping, Gubu, or Gulou areas. The defensive line there, with strong troop concentrations facing the Japanese across the river at Jiujiang, held firm. During the fiercest fighting at Xinhui, Japanese warships—over ten in number—concentrated at Jiujiang and once attempted to cross at Shaping to attack, but were repelled by Chinese forces and never returned. Thus Shaping, Gubu, and Gulou remained secure throughout. The front is very stable. Recently, Chinese forces in the upper West River have launched successive advances toward the Sanshui River mouth, coordinating with the North River army’s movements in preparation for a general counteroffensive. Consequently, the Japanese along the north bank of the West River are no longer as active as before and are shortening their upstream defensive line, withdrawing to the Sanshui River mouth and Makou. Thus the West River Chinese forces may soon achieve new progress.

To date, several thousand students have received relief. Loan disbursements amounted to 71,200 yuan in the 26th fiscal year and 207,300 yuan in the 27th fiscal year. The same principles will continue to apply going forward.  
(3) For overseas students whose provincial sponsorship has been cut off or whose family income in the war zones has been severed, three months’ living expenses (600 yuan in national currency) have been advanced. Those who have studied abroad for three years are provided return travel expenses of 700 yuan for government-sponsored students and 600 yuan for self-funded students. To date, 267 students have received assistance (49 in Britain, 83 in Germany, 78 in the United States, 38 in France, 4 in Italy, 12 in Belgium, 2 in Switzerland, and 1 in Denmark). Of these, 150 received three months’ living expenses and 117 received return travel expenses.

### Lingnan University After Relocating to Hong Kong Resuming Classes: Borrowing University of Hong Kong Facilities to Plan an Annam Branch

(Hong Kong dispatch) After relocating to Hong Kong last winter due to the war, Lingnan University, under President Li Ying-lin’s active planning, has shown vigorous development. The current situation is as follows:

(1) Overview of Each College  
The university, now in Hong Kong, is using University of Hong Kong facilities. All students in the Colleges of Arts, Science, and Engineering, as well as first-year students in the College of Agriculture and first- through third-year students in the College of Medicine, attend classes in the HKU buildings. Second- through fourth-year agriculture students do practical work at the Chang Garden in the New Territories. Fourth-year medical students attend lectures alongside HKU medical students at Queen Mary Hospital; fifth- and sixth-year students, pending hospital internships, have not yet resumed classes—some follow Dean Huang in Shaoguan for service, others study in Shanghai. Currently, the university offers one hundred academic programs in Hong Kong, seven to eight fewer than before. Engineering experiments use HKU laboratories; science experiments use HKU’s hydraulics testing plant and chemical laboratories; biophysics and biology experiments are likewise conducted there. Additionally, a site on Caine Road has been rented to house agriculture practice facilities using orchard land, with additional practice grounds at Lai Chi Kok Garden. Medical students have excellent internship opportunities at Queen Mary Hospital. As for library resources, departmental reference books are on loan and displayed at the Fong Ping-shan Chinese Library’s east reading room, and arrangements have been made with HKU’s Western Library to lend materials to Lingnan students. Physical education has been emphasized; during the Hong Kong period, programs have been adjusted to suit local conditions, focusing on indoor sports and outdoor activities (including excursions and visits) to integrate physical training into student life.

(2) Student Enrollment Statistics  
This semester, the university has over 600 students:  
   • College of Arts: 237 (8 in Chinese Language and Literature; 28 in Western Languages and Literature; 35 each in History & Political Science and Sociology; 39 in Commerce; 81 in Economics; 11 in Education)  
   • College of Science & Engineering: 132 (8 in Biology; 41 in Chemistry; 11 in Physics; 72 in Civil Engineering)  
   • College of Agriculture: 113 (29 in Animal Production; 84 in Crop Production)  
   • College of Medicine: 70  
   • Graduate Institute: 11 (6 in Physiology; 5 in Chemistry)  
Of these, three-quarters are male and one-quarter female.

(3) Concurrent Operation of Social Education  
In accordance with the Ministry of Education’s “Regulations on Concurrent Social Education for Schools at All Levels,” the university has organized social education work in four groups (Social Survey, Civic Education, Agricultural Extension, Wartime First Aid) covering thirteen projects, staffed by faculty and students from each college.

The university already has branches in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore. It has now accepted a request from the Lingnan University Alumni Association in Indochina to establish a branch in Annam for the education of local overseas Chinese children. Mr. Situ Wei was specially dispatched to plan all details, and the branch is now fully prepared.

### American School for Girls Physical Education Department Initiates Girls’ Play Day: Avoiding Competitive Athletic Strain; Invites All Girls’ Schools in Shanghai to Participate

Recently, the American physical education community has recognized that competitive sporting events can harm girls’ health, given physiological differences between males and females. They have therefore promoted more social and playful activities, leading to the emergence of “Play Day.” On a warm, breezy day, girls from various schools gather to participate in performances, games, and ball sports, aiming to cultivate body and mind, foster relationships, and eliminate the psychological tension of competition—truly an activity worthy of encouragement. The American School for Girls’ Physical Education Department has thus decided to invite all girls’ schools in Shanghai to participate in the first Shanghai Girls’ Play Day on May 27 at their campus. Invitations have gone to Western schools (English Concession School, Western Girls’ School, North Fourth Girls’ School, Sacred Heart, Loreto) and Chinese schools (Zhongxi, Works Girls’ High School, Chongde, Qixiu, Qingxin, Moor, etc.). A grand occasion is expected. This afternoon at 5:00, the school hopes each invited institution will send at least one representative to an organizational meeting at the American School for Girls, where the Shanghai Girls’ Secondary Schools Athletic Federation will be established to coordinate various girls’ sports activities.

### All Shanghai–Zhejiang Traffic Cut Off; Blockade Enforced at Mouth of the Ou River; Vessels Between Shanghai and Wenzhou Return One After Another; Japanese Warships Still Anchored Offshore with No Movement

Off the mouth of the Ou River in eastern Zhejiang, four Japanese warships suddenly arrived the day before yesterday, intending to reconnoiter Wenzhou. Three Japanese aircraft then flew over the city district and dropped bombs. As the situation grew increasingly tense, the Wenzhou–Taizhou Defense Command ordered all steamers anchored outside Wenzhou to depart the Ou River by yesterday afternoon and barred any vessels from entering, declaring a blockade of all traffic. The steamer Mo Fu, which set sail for Shanghai yesterday morning, and four steamers bound from Shanghai to Wenzhou—the Te Ping, Ha Na, Fei Kang, and Hai Fu—all turned back. Yesterday, however, the Japanese side remained inactive. Should the situation relax, it is hoped that the blockade will be lifted at once. The following reports summarize each development:

Authorities Announce Blockade of the Ou River

After repeated harassment by Japanese warships and aircraft along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, Chinese military authorities, aiming to strengthen defenses and consolidate local security, had previously proclaimed blockades at the mouths of Dinghai, Haimen, and Zhenhai. To maintain Shanghai–Zhejiang traffic, however, the Ou River at Wenzhou had remained open for navigation. With the sudden arrival two days ago of four Japanese warships at the mouth of the Ou River, anchoring offshore at Wuli and even bombarding the Huanghuaguan Fortress, followed by three Japanese aircraft bombing the urban district (the reports of bombings were confirmed by inquiries to various shipping circles; yesterday’s report of inaccuracy was false), the situation in Wenzhou turned sharply tense. Yesterday, local shipping circles received orders from the Wenzhou–Taizhou Defense Command instructing all steamer companies to direct ships anchored outside Wenzhou to depart the Ou River at noon on the 23rd (yesterday) and to bar any incoming vessels. Thus, the Ou River was officially declared closed to traffic.

Steamer Mo Fu Sets Sail from Wenzhou for Shanghai Yesterday Morning

The steamer Mo Fu, owned by the German firm Lihe & Co., departed Shanghai for Wenzhou on the 10th of this month and arrived there on the 21st, where it was loading cargo. It had been scheduled to return to Shanghai today. Upon receiving official notice, it departed the Ou River early yesterday at 10:20 a.m. and returned directly to Shanghai. Company headquarters received a wireless report from Captain Mr. Berg, stating that the vessel is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning.

All Steamers Bound for Wenzhou Ordered to Return

Although Shanghai’s various steamer companies had received word two days ago of the impending closure of the Ou River, no formal order had yet been issued, so the steamers continued their scheduled sailings. The Te Ping, Ha Na, Fei Kang, and Hai Fu all departed yesterday morning before 9 a.m. for Wenzhou. Around 10 a.m., upon receiving word of the traffic closure, each vessel was instructed via wireless to reverse course and await further orders. Since the blockade was not yet fully confirmed, they were told to anchor offshore outside Wusong and await developments. By 4 p.m., the blockade was fully confirmed, and the Ha Na, Hai Fu, Fei Kang, and Te Ping all departed from Wusong in succession, returning to Shanghai.

Steamer Bao Li Still Anchored Offshore at Wuli

The steamer Bao Li, operated by the Italian firm Yihua & Co., sailed from Shanghai for Wenzhou at 4 p.m. on the 20th and arrived offshore at Wuli on the morning of the previous day, only to be intercepted by Japanese warships, boarded, and inspected. The boarding party declared that there were military operations in Wenzhou and that no vessels would be allowed to enter, so the Bao Li remained at anchor offshore awaiting developments. A reporter from Modern News inquired of the company yesterday, and the captain, Mr. Reggini, reported by telegram that the Bao Li was still anchored at Wuli. However, due to the weekly holiday, Mr. Reggini was not in the office, so details remain unclear until today. According to Chinese staff members, the vessel is expected to return to Shanghai.

Situation Between Wenzhou and Ningbo Remains Calm

The four Japanese warships anchored offshore at the mouth of the Ou River bombarded the Huanghuaguan Fortress in Wenzhou on the day before yesterday, but after a fierce counterattack by Chinese garrison forces, the Japanese ships failed in their attempt. Yesterday, Wenzhou remained peaceful all day; Japanese warships and aircraft were inactive, and local order remained serene as ever. In Ningbo, although several Japanese aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights the day before yesterday, no bombs were dropped, and commercial activity continued normally. The German steamer Ender, which remained in Ningbo to load cargo, will return to Shanghai within days upon receiving approval.

All Shanghai–Zhejiang Traffic Completely Cut Off

Since the outbreak of hostilities, Chinese military authorities had designated the Ningbo mouth of the Yong River, the Wenzhou mouth of the Ou River, and the Jiaojiang River at Haimen as open ports for navigation, resulting in frequent shipping and bustling cargo traffic. With the successive blockades of the Jiaojiang and Yong rivers, only the Ou River remained open, and the number of available vessels had been reduced to five following the internment of Portuguese steamers. Now that the Ou River has also been closed, all shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been completely suspended.

If Tension Eases, Blockade May Be Lifted Soon

According to inquiries by Modern News reporters, beginning yesterday the Wenzhou–Taizhou Defense Command ordered all ships barred from entering or leaving the Ou River purely to strengthen fortress defenses and prevent further Japanese harassment. Shipping observers believe this blockade is temporary and not intended to seal the river entirely. Since Shanghai–Zhejiang traffic now relies solely on Wenzhou, a prolonged closure would have severe repercussions. It is therefore anticipated that, if tensions subside even slightly, the river will be reopened and navigation restored at once.

### Intervention in Flag Displays Case; External Authorities Have Submitted the Matter; Verbal Protest Lodged at French Embassy; Confiscated National Flags to Be Returned Today

Regarding the dispute over the French Concession authorities' intervention against citizens displaying national flags, apart from negotiations conducted by the Taxpaying Chinese Merchants Association, various local organizations jointly petitioned the Chongqing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting it lodge a protest with the French Embassy in China and secure assurances that citizens would retain the freedom to display national flags in future. Yesterday, these organizations received a reply from external authorities, stating that, concerning the Shanghai French Concession's intervention in the flag displays case, a verbal protest has been delivered to the French Embassy, demanding that citizens’ freedom to display national flags not be interfered with hereafter. Additionally, the seized national flags from various shops, following negotiations by representatives of the Concession’s Taxpayers’ Association, have been approved for return by the French authorities. However, as of the afternoon before last, they had not yet been returned. Operations at French offices were suspended yesterday due to Sunday observance, so the Taxpayers’ Association will continue its efforts today to recover the flags.

### Customs Again Raises the Issue with the Japanese Side, Requesting Return of Seized Anti‑Smuggling Patrol Vessels; Japan Agreed in Principle, but Timing Unknown

All twenty‑plus anti‑smuggling patrol vessels belonging to the Jiangnan Customs were seized by the Japanese Navy following the withdrawal of Chinese forces from Shanghai, severely affecting customs anti‑smuggling operations. According to reliable outside sources, British Taxation Commissioner Rockford recently negotiated with the Japanese side, requesting the return of the seized patrol vessels. The Japanese have agreed to return them, but when this will occur remains unknown, as Japanese diplomatic “promises” have an uncertain record of fulfillment.

### Japanese Troops Reinforce Shanghai Suburbs

Two weeks ago, the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai redeployed Japanese‑collaborationist troops from Shanghai’s defenses to reinforce counter‑guerrilla operations along the Yangtze and in South China as well as along the Beijing–Hangzhou highways, leaving suburban Shanghai thinly defended. Yesterday morning, two transport ships sailed from the mouth of Suzhou Creek to the Yangshupu dock, carrying over 1,000 Korean soldiers by way of Taiwan. These troops were then distributed by military trucks to garrisons in southern Shanghai, Zhabei, and central Hongkou. After unloading the Korean soldiers and military supplies, the two transports are reported to be loading grain for shipment back to Japan.

### Pudong River Barrier Not Yet Blown; Remains Subject to Intermittent Blasting at Any Time, Without Time Restrictions

At Shiliupu, over a dozen vessels previously sunk to block navigation have remained unremoved by the Japanese, who have resorted to periodic bombardments for several months. Every three to five days, faint explosions can be heard from both the Pudong and Puxi riverbanks, but the charges are small and barely audible. Two crane ships are stationed there to recover iron parts and plates from the riverbed for shipment to Japan, a sizable salvage operation. Although some foreigners reported hearing blasts between 6 and 7 p.m. yesterday, a reporter who inspected Shiliupu did not hear any explosions. Ferry services across the Huangpu River continue as usual, with no suspensions. Ferrymen reported that the demolition teams work only during daylight and depart before dark, and there is no fixed schedule for blasting.

### Foreign‑Operated Buses in Hongkou Face Japanese Harassment; If Carrying Chinese Passengers, Will Be Subject to Inspection by Japanese Troops

According to the English‑language American Evening Post, citing the Japanese‑language Continental News Agency, three unauthorized public buses have recently been operating clandestinely between Yangshupu and the Waibaidu (Garden) Bridge. After ten days of operation, Japanese military police discovered them. On April 7th, they spotted a Ford‑model bus numbered 1930 traveling along Broadway Road and Yangshupu Road, which the authorities believe to be privately operated by foreign‑owned factories for employee transport. Shortly thereafter two more similar buses appeared. Plainclothes Japanese military police, accompanied by a Chinese individual, boarded one bus and charged a fare of six cents per passenger, whereas the Japanese‑owned China Central Metropolitan Bus Company charges ten cents for the same route. Investigation reveals that these buses have no operating license but have been “tacitly permitted” by the Public Concession Police Division’s Huishan Precinct to operate within its jurisdiction. Because the drivers are Westerners, the sentries along the route assume the operation is legitimate foreign business and allow the buses to pass without inspection. Japanese army and navy authorities now take a severe view of this matter and have announced that any public buses carrying Chinese passengers will be subject to inspection.

### Bailianjing Area Unsettled; Ferries Turned Back; All Ferry Landings Sealed

Except for the ferries at Zhoujiadu and South Bund, which continue to operate normally, the Bailianjing Six‑Mile Bridge ferry, recently resumed service, was repeatedly turned back by military personnel on the morning of the 23rd when attempting to depart the Concession. It is reported that the Bailianjing Six‑Mile Bridge area remains highly unsettled, with all ferry landings sealed and operations halted, making crossings difficult. At the ferry landings at Zhoujiadu, South Bund, and the main dock, security has been tightened and passengers are subject to strict inspections.

Imitation Water Patrol Training School May Collapse

The Water Patrol Training School organized by the Collaborationist Reorganizing Government’s Pacification Ministry, located within the Nantang Jiangnan Shipyard, had been actively recruiting cadets and was scheduled to open on the 1st of next month. However, on the night of the 22nd it was attacked by a team in plain clothes, resulting in the deaths of the collaborationist drill officers and several collaborationist policemen. By the time Japanese military police arrived, the assailants had vanished. It is now widely believed that this blow may cause the collapse of the training school.

Guo Bridge Ambush Kills Japanese Second Lieutenant

On the afternoon of the 22nd, a Japanese military patrol set out from Beiqiao along the Shanghai–Minhang Road and, near Tsüanqiao, was suddenly ambushed by guerrillas lying in wait in the fields. The Japanese troops panicked, abandoned their weapons, and fled. Three Japanese soldiers were killed in the engagement, including Second Lieutenant Otani.

### Collaborationist Envoys to Japan to Return to Shanghai Tomorrow; Rumors Say Chu Xiao’an and Gao Guangwu Are Also on Their Way; Collaborationist Authorities Preparing Precautions

The so‑called “Shanghai Mayor” collaborator Chu Xiao’an and “Nanjing Mayor” collaborator Gao Guangwu departed for Japan aboard the Japanese liner Nagasaki Maru on the 28th of last month to attend the so‑called “East Asian Cities Conference” and report on collaborationist political affairs. Their absence has now reached over twenty days. It is reported that they have boarded the Japanese liner Shanghai Maru for the return voyage from Tokyo to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive tomorrow at 2 p.m. Collaborationist authorities are preparing security measures to guard against any incident. It is widely rumored that the two “mayors” will swap posts next month, with Gao taking up the Shanghai position, while other collaborator appointments are expected to be finalized by month’s end.

### Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association Informs Members to Stand Firm to Prevent Divide‑and‑Rule, So as to Avoid Being Defeated One by One

The Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association issued a circular to all member firms yesterday, stating that the collaborationist authorities, coveting the fresh pork trade, have established a “Livestock Market” in Hongkou in an attempt to monopolize the business. Although this represents an unprecedented crisis for our industry, the Association, as leader of the trade, must redouble its efforts. It is currently devising strategies to counter this threat, but unity is essential to repel the aggressors. All members must remain steadfast, regardless of any violence or sacrifices, to secure final victory. On the 17th of this month, the Association issued a detailed statement of its position, and in order to prevent any divisive actions, this supplementary circular is issued. We trust that all members will unite, share the same purpose, and weather this storm together, and not be swayed by any entreaties to avoid being defeated in detail.

### Situation in Northern Jiangsu Favorable; Chinese Forces’ Fierce Attack at Rugao; Suburban Strongholds Recaptured One After Another; Haimen’s Third Factory Briefly Attacked

Since the Chinese military unit under General Chen Caifu launched its counteroffensive in the Dailuoqi and Haichong areas of northern Jiangsu, the situation has become tense. In recent days, many residents from Haimen, Qidong, and Rugao have fled to Shanghai. According to passengers arriving in Shanghai yesterday from Rugao, Rugao County Town is now completely encircled by Chinese forces, who have occupied all major suburban strongholds and are aggressively pushing against the city walls. The Japanese garrison, reliant on the city defenses, is said to be in a state of panic. The Tongru Highway has been damaged and is impassable to motor traffic. At Haimen’s city defenses in the north of Jiangsu, once guerrilla forces reclaimed the area, they renewed a fierce blood fight against the Japanese at the Third Factory. Shipping sources report that on the 21st Chinese troops briefly assaulted the Third Factory but withdrew after Japanese reinforcements arrived and their objectives were met. The two sides remain in standoff. In the suburbs of Qidong City, fighting has occurred for several consecutive days. Shipping between Shanghai and Beisha ports has plummeted due to the conflict, leaving companies operating at a loss and suspending services, resulting in a complete halt in operations.

### Five Members of Japanese Marine Corps at Yangjing Attempt to Avoid Combat, Flee Before Reinforcements Arrive, Abandoning Helmets and Rifles

The Fourth Battalion of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces stationed in the Yangjing district of Pudong recently received orders to dispatch a company from the Tianzhang Paper Mill in Lujiazui to the front lines three days ago, scheduled to depart at 2 p.m. However, that morning five soldiers deserted en masse, only discovered missing at roll call, leaving behind their helmets and rifles. A search party was dispatched, and two were apprehended in the rural area outside Pudong Avenue, but three remain unaccounted for. The company did not depart until 8 p.m., by which time the two captured soldiers were sent to Hongkou, and the whereabouts of the remaining three are still unknown.

### Zhejiang–Jiangxi Line Shortened Compared to Before; Operation Schedule Reduced to Two Runs Daily

Despite Nanchang becoming a guerrilla-held area, the Zhejiang–Jiangxi Railway remains operational to maintain transport to Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong. However, the section near Nanchang is effectively impassable, so the route has been shortened, terminating at Jinhua in Zhejiang Province and at Guixi in Jiangxi Province. For travel from Jiangxi to Hunan or Guangdong, a new route established by Jiangxi Province is now in use. Consequently, most rolling stock has been redirected from the Zhejiang–Jiangxi line to the Hunan–Guangxi line. Passenger services on the Zhejiang–Jiangxi route have been reduced from four to two daily trips.

### Post Office Announces Suspension of Parcel Shipments North of Jinan

After resuming acceptance of large and small parcels to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, Shanghai’s Post and Telecommunications Administration has been overwhelmed by the volume of shipments, resulting in packaging rooms piled high. To clear the backlog, the Administration has issued a notice suspending the acceptance of parcels and heavy packages destined for Jinan and the areas of Shandong Province north of Jinan. The notice states that, effective immediately, all parcels and heavy packages addressed to Jinan or any locations in Shandong Province north of Jinan will be temporarily suspended.

### Reports of Wang Jingwei’s Apostate Allies Planning to Establish a “Republic News Agency” to Disseminate Poisonous Propaganda and Seduce the Public; Chinese People Aware of Their Concealed Intents and Will Not Fall For It

Since Wang Jingwei’s defection and betrayal of the nation, there has been widespread outrage across the country, with petitions to the Central Government demanding severe punishment. Refusing to repent, Wang and his cohorts have recently arrived covertly in Shanghai and taken refuge on Dixiwei Road in Hongkou. They intend to collaborate with the puppet “Central China Reformation Government” to realize their puppet regime’s dreams, and have resumed activities in the press, planning to establish the Far East Daily. They have also been organizing a “Republic News Agency” to spread poisonous news and narcotize the public mind. However, the Chinese people are fully aware of their duplicitous intentions and will not be ensnared. Their efforts amount only to the fruitless toiling of traitors’ minds. (Modern News)

### Xujiahui Observatory (1)

—by Tang Minghe

(1) Establishment

The Xujiahui Observatory was founded sixty-five years ago. It is the earliest modern scientific observatory in the Far East. Why call it “modern scientific”? Because as early as the seventeenth century, in Beijing, Jesuit missionaries such as Matteo Ricci, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, and Ferdinand Verbiest had introduced Western mathematics and astronomy to China. In the late Ming and early Qing eras, an observatory was established in our ancient capital. Those who have visited the Beijing Palace Museum may still recall the instruments on display there.

In the late nineteenth century, as Shanghai’s treaty port began to flourish and foreign shipping increased, these vessels were often destroyed by typhoons. East Asian typhoons had wreaked much devastation, and in recent years continued to menace the region, as seen in the great calamity in the Philippines. At that time, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Catholic priest Deehevreus to establish an observatory to forecast typhoons.

The priest agreed, but stipulated that the observatory must transmit telegraphic reports freely, since an observatory must exchange meteorological data with others. The proposal was approved by the telegraph authorities, and in 1873 the Far East’s first modern observatory was founded in Xujiahui, Shanghai.

(2) Development of Meteorological Forecasting

The primary work of the Xujiahui Observatory has been meteorological reporting, which has provided significant contributions to the maritime community. It maintains close contact with over fifty meteorological stations (some in the Pacific Ocean, some at Chinese coastal customs posts, some at inland government stations, and others abroad), as well as commercial and naval vessels at sea. Each day it receives over two hundred weather reports from various locations and broadcasts its own four times daily.

When a typhoon approaches Shanghai, the observatory dispatches a priest to the signal tower on the Bund outside the French Concession to await inquiries from ship captains. When the typhoon arrives, the warning sirens on the Bund can be heard. In recent years, warnings have been transmitted by wireless telegraph, reducing reliance on wired telegraph.

Over the past fifty to sixty years, at least fourteen hundred typhoons have been recorded along the Chinese coast, and thanks to Xujiahui’s warnings, countless ships have been spared disaster. Naval vessels, shipping companies, and mariners have all expressed their gratitude to the observatory. If you visit the Xujiahui Observatory and enter the building, you will see a photograph of the British warship H.M.S. Kent hanging on the wall, with a note of thanks from the ship’s captain in the corner. That is only one of many commendatory items displayed there. Because the reporter paid special attention to that photo and read the inscription aloud, it is cited here as an example.

Standard Time

The Xujiahui Observatory also performs the work of calculating standard time and broadcasting it by wireless telegraph. Time can be determined with an accuracy of one hundredth of a second. Transmissions occur daily at noon and at 9 p.m., allowing ships in the harbor to correct their chronometers.

The observatory now houses two new astronomical clocks in a temperature- and pressure-controlled vault; their daily error does not exceed one hundredth of a second. In addition to timekeeping and broadcasting, they are used for research. In 1926 the International Astronomical Union designated three locations on Earth to serve as standard time reference stations. Xujiahui Observatory is one of them, along with Algiers in Africa and San Diego, California in the United States, and has been in operation since October 1926.

Xujiahui was also the earliest center for geomagnetic research in East Asia, due to the presence of naval facilities in Shanghai. In 1877, instruments were moved to Cajabachang for magnetic observations. Over the past fifty to sixty years, detailed records of geomagnetic variations have been kept. In 1922 the Chinese government instructed Customs and Japanese scientists to jointly survey coastal geomagnetic conditions, utilizing instruments and technicians largely supplied by the Cajabachang Geophysical Department.

The Xujiahui Observatory is also equipped with seismological instruments. Although these were installed later than the others, they are highly sophisticated. There is one Wiechert horizontal seismograph and one Galitzin vertical seismograph. Thus, Xujiahui holds a vital position in global earthquake research. Over the past ten years, the most important records have been the two major earthquakes in North China.

### Balanced Fund Steering Committee Established　Legal Currency Value Increasingly Stable　International Trade Improving with Ample Cash Reserves　Replenished Foreign Exchange Fund Strengthens Wartime Effort

After the Ministry of Finance secured a loan of ten million pounds from the four banks—British HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, China & Japan, and Bank of Communications—it organized the Balanced Fund Steering Committee. The legal currency’s value has become more stable; the foreign exchange fund is increasingly well supplied; the entire financial system is more secure; the war effort is strengthened; and international trade with China is being favorably impacted. Public sentiment is recorded as follows:

Careful Legal Currency Issuance Policy  
The legal currency issuance policies of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank have been especially cautious. The issuance volume in June of the 26th year stood at 1,007 million yuan, and in June of the 27th year at 1,727 million yuan, an increase of 300 million yuan. Some assert this as proof of inflation. In fact, after the war’s center shifted inland, provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan adopted the legal currency; commercial credit contracted, prompting direct cash transactions. Counterfeit money flooded occupied areas, intensifying hoarding of legal tender. Disruptions in supply and demand drove prices upward, necessitating additional cash for transactions. These factors all justified the increase in issuance. In Shanghai, contraction of currency manifested in high remittance discounts. Therefore, the government has never overissued legal tender, enabling it to maintain its value.

Popular Support and Ample Reserves  
Since implementation of the legal currency policy, the people have unanimously expressed support. The ups and downs of the legal currency directly affect personal wealth, arousing strong emotions. Except for a tiny number of unscrupulous speculators, everyone wishes for a solid monetary foundation, seeing benefit for both country and self. Exchanging legal currency for foreign exchange is deemed shameful. Cash reserves of legal tender have remained above sixty percent at all times. Our nation’s US dollar holdings in the United States, as of the end of last June, are estimated at 84 million dollars; this serves as our foreign exchange reserve, stabilizing the value of the legal currency around current exchange rates, preventing wild fluctuations. Domestically, roughly half of remaining silver reserves can still be mobilized, enabling issuance of an additional 200 million yuan of legal currency, while maintaining current exchange rates for over two years.

Effective Management and Improved Trade  
After the Central Bank began overseeing foreign exchange approvals, it supplied legitimate commercial needs to the fullest, denying applications from speculators. Channels for capital flight have been closed. Export proceeds in foreign exchange are sold to government banks at legal rates. Imports of foreign goods have declined amid rising prices, benefiting our country’s balance of payments. The government has vigorously promoted wartime thrift; for several months, a trade surplus has even appeared. Overseas Chinese, in patriotic fervor, have sent increasing remittances, preventing sharp shifts in the international balance of payments. Though indirect, these measures robustly support the value of legal currency.

Cooperation of Domestic and Foreign Banks in Preservation  
During the war, our banking sector’s assistance to the government in stabilizing finance is undisputed. Allied banks have likewise collaborated to uphold foreign exchange. Whenever foreign exchange markets wavered, domestic and foreign banks led by example, dumping large quantities of foreign currency, which restored stability to legal currency values. Last October, when Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another, the legal currency exchange market remained entirely unaffected. On the contrary, funds that had fled to Hong Kong began flowing back to Shanghai, causing the legal currency to appreciate. This thwarted the Japanese puppet authorities’ numerous attempts to undermine the currency. Within occupied areas, the legal tender continues to circulate, its value surpassing that of counterfeit bills.

### Reception for French Envoy Gossmer by the French Community

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily of the 23rd, a tea reception was held last evening (the 22nd) at the French General Association to honor the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Gossmer. Attended by many guests, they were received by the Association’s chairman, Lawyer Dashang. Speeches were made on all sides, exchanging mutual respects. Ambassador Gossmer’s address earnestly urged unity among the French community in Shanghai to endure these difficult times. He stated that, though he had previously served while residing chiefly in Peking and was not yet familiar with Shanghai, he greatly admired the work of the French community here. It was also reported that at last night’s tea reception, the French Consul General Baudais, due to other commitments, was absent.

### French Concession Authorities Allow Expansion of Factory Zones to Pijiahuizhi Road but Ban Night Operations; Manufacturers Petition Electricity Company for Rate Reductions

The French Concession authorities, seeing factories from the war zone moving into the Concession to resume operations, designated more remote thoroughfares—Kangdi Road, Xuehuali Road, Fuliuli Road, South Jinshenzufu Road, Yalbei Road, Ladu Road, and others—as factory zones. After the war, commercial development became irregular: old factories gradually increased and new ones were added, causing original factory areas to become cramped. Factory owners jointly requested relaxation of restrictions from the Concession authorities to maintain industrial development. This request has been granted, extending factory zones westward to Xujiahui, Qiqi Road, Betang Road, north of Jinjqiao Bridge, and along Xujiahui Road. Factories using electric machinery are permitted to set up there; handcraft workshops not using electric machines remain unrestricted.

Residential Zones Ban Night Operations  
Since the newly authorized factory zones fall within predominantly residential areas where many non-Chinese reside, the authorities have ruled that factories established in the Xujiahui area may not operate at night, to avoid noise. Both the National Products United Association of the French Concession and the Chinese Merchants’ Association petitioned for concessions, but no amendments could be made.

Manufacturers Seek Electricity Rate Cuts  
Recently, the French-owned Water and Power Company abruptly increased electricity rates by 25 percent, severely burdening factories. Factory owners have verbally requested rate reductions but received no reply. They have now formally asked national product associations to negotiate with the company to rescind the increase. We ourselves will likewise petition the company to lower the proposed hike to sustain industry and commerce.

### Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting through the Ages Replaces Works; Closes Tomorrow at Six

The exhibition of Chinese calligraphy and painting through the ages, held on the fourth floor of Daxin, was organized to raise funds for medical relief. Thanks to enthusiastic contributions from major Shanghai collectors, over three hundred priceless works were gathered. Due to space constraints, not all could be displayed at once. Two rotations have already occurred, but many pieces remain. To satisfy art lovers, a third rotation will begin today, replacing most previously displayed works and fully exhibiting the remaining 120-plus pieces. Among them: Mr. Cao Youqing’s Song Dynasty “Xisai Fishing Villa Paired Poems”; Mr. Wu Hufan’s Ming Dynasty Tang Yin’s “Burning Incense in Silent Contemplation”; Wen Zhengming’s “Tiger Mountain Bridge”; Qiu Shizhou’s “Gate of Eternal Spring”; Qing Emperor Yuntian’s “Green-and-Blue Landscape”; Mr. Li Bake’s Ming Shen Shitian landscape; Mr. Xu Junqing’s Ming Lu Zhi’s “White-Headed Wren”; Mr. Pu Xiyuan’s Ming Yang Wenzu’s “High Escapist at Mountain Villa”; Mr. Ding Huikang’s Ming Liu Wan’an’s “Green Peaks and Curled Branches”; Dong Qichang’s “Scenes at She Mountain”; Qing Shi Xishang Ren’s “Sound of Springs and Pine Rhythms”; “Feimeng” host’s Qing Mi Bijiang couple’s collaborative flower paintings; Mr. Liu Haisu’s Qing Shi Daoji’s “Pure Fragrance Together Brushed”; “Plum Clear Pine” and others; Mr. Peng Gongfu’s Cha Shibiao landscape album; Mr. Wang Jiquan’s Qing Wang Hui’s imitation of Juran landscape scroll; Mr. Sun Bangrui’s Qing Tang Yusheng’s “Dai Chunshi Landscape Scroll”—all masterworks of their authors. For those seeking an abundant display of Ming and Qing art, this rotation is the richest. The exhibition will close tomorrow at 6 p.m., making today and tomorrow the final opportunity.

### Yingkou and Ningbo Associations to Procure Imported Rice to Aid Hometown; First Batch of 50,000 Dan Sold at 2 Yuan Loss per Dan

The Ningbo Overseas-Residents Association in Shanghai, to relieve rice shortages for their native towns, has decided to purchase 100,000 dan of Saigon rice, first procuring 50,000 dan to ship to Ningbo for relief. Based on current foreign exchange rates, they will incur a loss of 2 yuan per dan; this deficit will be subsidized jointly by Shanghai and Ningbo parties.

### Adopted Son’s Wretched Ways; Sues Foster Mother for Embezzlement after Squandering Money—Dispute Resolved, Repentance Repeated

At No. 509 Metcalfe Road, in the Shunkang South Trading Store established by fund collection during his lifetime by Ningbo native Chen Yongkang, Chen’s wife Ms. Hu bore no children. In earlier years the couple adopted a son named Nanshan, now twenty years old. He has spent his life wasting money and consorting with disreputable associates.

Gambling and Dancing  
His chief pleasures, after his father’s passing, grew ever more debauched. Once his funds were exhausted, he first surreptitiously took money from the household. When his mother prevented further theft by strict watch, he turned to stealing cash from the Tonghe Trading Company, where he worked. He was discovered and fired, then expelled by his mother. Soon Nanshan begged relatives to mediate, professed repentance, submitted a written apology to his mother, and was allowed home as if once again store proprietor. Yet his innate vice being inborn, once well fed he relapsed into old habits and chose to wander.

Suing Mother for Alimony  
At a winter session, he filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against his foster mother Ms. Hu, seeking division of the inheritance (i.e., Shunkang South Trading Store). During pretrial inquiries, since the plaintiff was under the age of legal majority, lacking legal capacity to sue, the case was not decided on its merits; the court merely advised both sides to settle privately. On the 11th of this month, Chen Nanshan suddenly turned himself in at the Gordon Road police station, accusing his mother Ms. Hu of continuing to misappropriate part of a 5,000-yuan inheritance (again referring to the trading store) since his father’s death in the 23rd year of the Republic. The local sub-prefect assigned Chinese and Western detectives to investigate; they found the store operations intact, all property in Ms. Hu’s control; and that she would not allow her son to eat or sleep at the store, letting him roam freely. Relying on the complainant’s statement, the public prosecutor brought charges of “misappropriation of inheritance” against Ms. Hu. A summons was issued. Yesterday morning the defendant appeared before Division Eight, where Procurator Zhong Qing examined the case. After police attorney Zhang Shizhu presented the facts, during which Chen Nanshan testified that he was unemployed and had nowhere to live, lodging at Baoyu Li in Dongxinqiao, and now demanded to return to his mother’s home. He added that last year in his civil case he had made the same request but was not admitted by the defendant; at that time Magistrate Xu even ordered his arrest, which he reported to the station. Upon questioning, Ms. Hu recounted her son’s past misbehavior; her defense attorney Li Gengxiang produced Nanshan’s repentance letter, civil court verdict, and store account ledgers. After mutual debate, Magistrate Zhong acquitted Ms. Hu.

### Robbery and Assault at Cigarette and Tobacco Shop; Three Thieves Sentenced Separately

Shibulin (30), a Jiangbei barber who recently lost his livelihood, conspired with fellow countrymen Wang Guisheng and Yang Chunlin. On the evening of the thirteenth, at 7:45 p.m., they armed themselves with a water pipe repurposed as a pistol and stormed into the Yongshengxiang Cigarette Shop at No. 280 Yanshan Road. They struck proprietor Yuan Jinbo on the head with the pipe, causing him to fall in agony. Seizing the opportunity, the trio snatched over one hundred yuan worth of cigarettes and legal tender, then fled. Pursuit by Chinese detectives Lu Yisheng and Liu Changgen of Yangshupu police station, in conjunction with Wangshipu station’s Huatian substation, led to the arrest of Shi, Wang, and Yang near Nos. 10 Yanshan Road and Qiqihar Road in Funning Road. They were brought to the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, under Magistrate Jiang Shuzi in Division Three, station counsel Zhang Tianyin charged them, invoking Articles 228 and 229 of the Criminal Code for armed robbery in concert and seeking severe punishment. The defendants pled guilty but requested leniency. Magistrate Jiang sentenced Shi Bulin to five years’ imprisonment; Wang Guisheng and Yang Chunlin each received two years and six months, as a deterrent.

### Concealing a Pistol, Turned Over to Police—Robbery Charge Actually a Dispute; Awaiting Witness Testimony

Zhang Ruquan, from Xuzhou, was arrested by Putuo Road police station and delivered to the First Special District Court after being found early on the 6th at 3:30 a.m. carrying a revolver without ammunition, bearing the old stamp of the municipal Public Security Bureau. He was accused of robbing the property of Ma Eryan Chenglong, resident of No. 137 Xiaoda Road, Jiangbei. Zhang initially confessed, was remanded, and yesterday morning was brought before Division Three. Station counsel Zhang Tianyin stated that in pretrial detention, the defendant denied committing robbery, claiming the matter arose from a gambling quarrel. Both alleged victims failed to appear in court today; thus the charges of robbery and illegal possession of a firearm cannot be adjudicated. Zhang testified he had known Ma for years; they sold fish near the Concession’s large clock. On that occasion he was gambling at Ma’s house; the pistol he carried unloaded was found on a battlefield, he claimed. The court rescheduled for the 27th to summon the Yans and Ma Eryan and further investigate. The defendant remains detained.

### Gamblers Taken from Den; Whereabouts Unknown

At the Dongzhen Deji gambling den in West Shanghai, authorities of the Concession, acting on tip-offs about stolen goods, searched the premises with Japanese officials, seizing a pistol and, by informant identification, detained eight tea servers and other staff. More than several days have passed since their arrest; the den’s operators have reportedly approached Japanese authorities seeking their release, to no avail. The current location of the eight detainees is unknown.

### Puppet “Police Bureau” Demands Housing Tax

The city’s puppet “Police Bureau” has for days dispatched large numbers of puppet policemen to homes inside and outside the old city walls, forcibly collecting housing taxes: an estimated 5 yuan per three-story building, 3.50 yuan for a single foreign-style house (storefront), 2 yuan for a single-story house. Those failing to pay after three levies are detained at the “Police Bureau” until paid. Since most residents inside and outside the old city walls lack real estate and are laborers, many have been arrested for nonpayment. Unoccupied houses are sealed by the puppet police.

### Evacuate Concessions Promptly or Face Death Without Compensation

Yesterday, the puppet “Shanghai Municipality” issued two “secret orders,” respectively delivered to various puppet “departments and subordinate organizations,” ordering all puppet officials to evacuate the foreign concessions promptly, declaring that it “will bear no responsibility for relief.” After the puppet Foreign Minister Chen Lu was assassinated, a similarly worded “secret order” was issued; this second puppet “order” indicates that puppet personnel do not take the puppet “municipal government” seriously.

### Factory Owner’s Wife Caught in Adultery Twice; Husband Seeks Divorce; Court Grants Divorce in Part, She Appeals, Husband Seeks Dismissal

Modern lady Zhao Lianying is the wife of Ningbo native Zheng Yanling, owner of the Weishun Knitting Factory on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. After ten years of marriage, they have been before the court more than ten times. Lianying, now thirty and charming, soon after marriage committed adultery with her brother-in-law. Her husband discovered this, and she voluntarily wrote a repentance letter. Zheng, concerned about his reputation, did not pursue the matter. Unexpectedly, her licentious nature persisted, and she later engaged in an inappropriate affair with a factory employee. In May of last year, Zheng again discovered her misconduct; she asked to write another repentance letter, which he permitted, hoping for marital harmony. Nevertheless, Lianying continued secret rendezvous at inns with her lover. In the autumn, Zheng, with no alternative, reported her to the Concession police, and she was brought before the Second Court and sentenced to four months’ imprisonment. Her appeal was denied, and the verdict became final. Because of her continued amorous indulgence with no sign of remorse, Zheng filed for divorce in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court. The initial trial granted the divorce, but Lianying, dissatisfied, appealed to the Third Branch Court. Yesterday, presided over by Chief Judge Xia with magistrates and clerks in the Third Court, both parties were summoned. Appellant Zhao Lianying testified that she did not deny repeatedly committing adultery nor denies having given two repentance letters and serving a criminal sentence. She argued that, having been forgiven by her husband via repentance letters, under the law adultery no longer constitutes grounds for divorce; moreover, Zheng’s domicile in Ningbo, not Shanghai, meant the divorce should have been filed in Ningbo court; the original trial ignored jurisdiction, rendering the verdict illegal, and should be overturned. Respondent Zheng Yanling testified that although his registered residence is Ningbo, he has resided in Shanghai for many years operating the factory and regards Shanghai as his permanent domicile; the trial magistrate’s decision to grant divorce conforms with law; Lianying’s repeated adultery, which she admits, naturally precludes lifelong marital unity. He requested the court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the original verdict. After oral arguments, the court adjourned debate and concluded the hearing, scheduling judgment for April 26.

### “Lieutenant Xu” Betrays and Surrenders, Illegally Arrests Innocent Villagers, Seizes Large Stockpile of Arms

Xu Fugui, a Shandong native, formerly served as a company commander in the Tax Police Regiment during Shanghai’s wartime. After the National Army withdrew west, Xu and several dozen soldiers stayed in the countryside west of Shanghai. Last year Xu led his men to join the Zhejiang-Jiangsu Action Committee’s Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, commanding the Sixth Battalion under Jin Fuxiang as second company commander and deputy battalion adjutant, earning him the nickname “Lieutenant Xu.” Recently, stirred by a certain collaborator, Xu, succumbing to greed, defected midstream and joined the West Shanghai Garrison under Japanese Captain Sakei, serving as chief warrant officer. Currently stationed in Caohejing Township near Jiangsu Second Prison, he and his dressed-as-civilians Japanese-Chinese troops have conducted dragnet searches for guerrilla forces in West Shanghai, arresting innocent villagers indiscriminately. Unable to endure this harassment, villagers last night (the 21st) around 9 p.m. Xu, with his civilian-clad Japanese-Chinese forces, went to the Catholic Church at the eastern end of Qibao Township, arresting 23-year-old Songjiang native Zhou Yueming, a performer of boat-people lyrical tunes, and nineteen-year-old Wu Fengying (aka Ada), granddaughter of Wu Youshan and daughter of milk-seller Hu Ki Yu in front of Zhenqian in Xujiahui Township. They also seized a pistol from the Wu family. Later, they searched a certain surname Qiao’s hall and unearthed more than forty rifles and two boxes of ammunition, reportedly arms buried by the Sixth Battalion’s Jin Unit. Verification is pending.

### Japanese-Puppet Forces Unearth Hidden Weapons

At Caohejing Township in West Shanghai, Japanese authorities, having bribed ruffians disguised as soldiers to track guerrilla activity, have left signs of puppet personnel all around the township. Led by the puppet police commandant stationed in the prison, they first excavated previously hidden arms. Yesterday morning, puppet forces and puppet police unearthed over thirty rifles and pistols. Reports say that in recent days Japanese-puppet forces have captured a considerable quantity of weapons.

### Attempted Rape of Young Woman; Defendant Denies Rape

Jiang Laixiang, daughter of Jiang Liankui from Nantong, nineteen, was to be introduced to a prospective suitor this February. In early March, her cousin Lu was entrusted to bring her to Shanghai, to stay with relatives and procure trousseau fabrics and furnishings. En route, Lu handed her off to countryman Qian Haihai, who failed to deliver her to her relatives and instead took her to his home on Kennaihai Road and raped her. Her brother Jiang Hukuan in Shanghai learned of this and reported to the police, who sent detectives to Yong’an Street to arrest Qian Haihai, rescue Jiang and return her to her brother. Meanwhile Qian was sent to the Second Special Court, charged with violating the family. During multiple hearings, he flatly denied having relations with the girl and was remanded for further investigation. As previously reported, yesterday afternoon at the resumed hearing, only the plaintiffs Jiang Hukuan and his sister Laixiang appeared; Qian Haihai again denied the rape, testifying that he had met the girl years ago at the Concession near the big clock selling fish. He claimed they lodged at the port hostelry one night, then took the ferry to Shanghai; the girl refused to stay with her aunt and temporarily stayed at his house; later Lu came to Shanghai and rented a house with him, and the girl stayed with Lu, having nothing to do with him; they needed Lu to appear in court to clarify the matter, and so forth. Upon questioning, the girl admitted that Lu entrusted Qian to bring her to Shanghai. The court adjourned to the 27th to subpoena and reexamine, and Qian remains in custody.

### Factory Worker Severely Scalded

Early yesterday at about 5 a.m., factory worker Diao Jinguang, 18, from Anhui, employed at the Dagong Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 1001 Huade Road in Hongkou, accidentally fell into a large cloth-boiling vat. He was immediately scalded and cried for help. Another worker rescued him, but he sustained severe burns all over his body. An ambulance was summoned, and he was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Reports say his life may be in danger.

### Man Hangs Himself to Death

Late the night before last, during curfew hours, an unnamed man of about forty, appearing to be a businessman, quietly went to the back gate of No. 86 Garesché Road in the French Concession and hanged himself from an iron bar in a window using a cloth strip. Not until about 5 a.m. yesterday did a sixteen-year-old maid named Cheng, employed at No. 86, open the back door to empty the chamber pot and discover the body. Police were summoned and pronounced him dead. He likely killed himself due to economic pressure. The case was reported to the Xafly Road police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Red Cross funeral parlor’s subsidiary hall for autopsy, awaiting retrieval by the Second Special Court for legal inquest.

### Elderly Man Run Over and Injured by Vehicle

Chang Tingquan, 58, a Jiangbei resident at No. 6, Lane 87, Jing’an Temple Road, yesterday at 8:20 p.m., while crossing the intersection of Hede and Fuxu roads in West Shanghai, was struck by a speeding military vehicle number 6980. He could not evade in time, was knocked down, and his left leg was run over and severed. He bled profusely and fainted. Nearby police recorded the military plate number and summoned ambulance No. 83, which rushed him to the hospital.

### Low-Pressure Trough Moves Toward Japan; Shanghai Weather Clears Up

Our city has recently been disrupted by a southern low-pressure trough, causing extremely unsettled weather and unceasing spring rains. Though such patterns often occur in spring, the duration this year has been unusually prolonged. Until the day before yesterday, as Yangtze River basin pressures rose, Shanghai’s weather cleared up, and the low-pressure trough moved on toward Japan, bringing clear skies to our city.

### Kidnapped by Female Bandits in Pudong’s Jinjia Lane and Ransomed

Jin Xiaoshi, over sixty, a woodworker living in Jinjia Lane, Pudong Township, was abducted by female bandits under the ringleader Jin Fengying. Yesterday he was ransomed for 260 yuan in foreign currency and released. This incident reveals the active state of bandit and puppet forces, making life intolerable for people in occupied areas.

### Dense Defensive Works Along the Zhabei Concession

In various locations along the Zhabei concession, defensive works have recently been arranged with unusual thoroughness. Whether along the river or at key road junctions, substantial installations are in place. Yesterday afternoon at around 2 o’clock, an observer conducted a special inspection and recorded the following:

At the west end of West Suzhou Road, on the north bank of the New Bridge by the Sampan Factory, there were originally defensive works erected by Chinese troops. These have now been extensively overhauled by Japanese soldiers: dilapidated sandbags and the like have been replaced with gravel and cement mortar, with small firing ports left both above and below for mounting machine guns or light artillery. The positions afford clear views both eastward and westward. Two Japanese soldiers stand guard at the bridgehead, rifles at the ready. On the southern bank toward the concession, the iron gates remain closed and no American troops are present—only a single Chinese constable guards beneath the bridge. On the north bank of the Suzhou River along Guangfu Road, the open ground to the east is piled high with yellow sand and stones. It was reported that because yesterday was Sunday, no one was working; normally transport vehicles arrive continuously to load and carry the materials. Along the riverbank at points such as the Meiyuan Road intersection, Huasheng Road intersection, New Zha Bridge, Chang’an Road intersection, and from Wuzhen Road Bridge to the new Garbage Bridge, dense sand fortifications have been erected. At the Manchuria Road intersection (the corner by Jiangsu Bank), a new cement bunker has recently been built facing the concession. Along Northwest Tibet Road at intersections such as Arabaisi Road, Mongolian Road, the terminus of Northwest Tibet Road, and Xinjiang Road, similar defensive works stand ready. At the Xinjiang Road–Rehe Road junction, yet another new cement bunker has been constructed. Looking west from the Gansu Road–Haining Road intersection, aside from a few sandbag emplacements, the roadway itself has been painted green. On North Zhejiang Road, near the Ai’erjin Road intersection on the Chinese side, entrances at Huaxing Road and North Zhejiang Road are blocked with sandbags. Along the boundary road to Baoshan Road, aside from the fort at the Baoshan Road intersection—which was long ago completed—another new fort has been finished opposite the North Railway Station on Kenenghai Road.

### Overworked Japanese Police: Hongkou District Unsafe, Recent Burglary Rings Rampant

Within the heavily guarded Japanese area of Hongkou, a series of major thefts has recently occurred, deeply worrying the Japanese authorities. The Japanese Consulate Police Station has mobilized all its officers to intensify investigations. After several days of detective work, at 11 p.m. on the 21st they arrested two specialized tobacco thieves, Qiu Sanbao (34) and Gu Youguang (25). The pair revealed that their accomplices were hiding at No. 1014 Aidoya Road. On the 22nd, Japanese police, together with the detention bureau, raided that address and apprehended Yu Hongzhang (26) and Chen Zaiyou (22). According to Japanese-language newspapers, Qiu and his associates are also suspected of involvement in arson.

### Wenzhou Blockade: Charcoal Prices Spike by About One Dime per Basket; Fuel Supplies Unlikely to Run Short

Charcoal is one of the city’s primary everyday fuels alongside briquettes and white coal. Normally it is gathered from various parts of eastern Zhejiang at ports from Ningbo to Wenzhou and shipped by steamer to Shanghai. Since the Ningbo–Shanghai service was suspended, shipments have continued in steady stream from Wenzhou. Yesterday word reached Shanghai that Wenzhou has imposed a blockade and halted steamers, making supply sources difficult. As a result, charcoal merchants have taken the opportunity to raise market prices by about one dime per basket. However, supplies of white coal remain ample, so fuel shortages are not expected.

### Boundary‑Crossing Robbery on Balinan Road: Woman Shot in Chest While Pursuing Thieves Who Fled With Stolen Goods Despite Her Calls for Help

At No. 23 in the cross‑boundary zone of Balinan Road (near Yidingpan Road), at about 7:15 yesterday evening, while the householders were dining around the table, several thieves suddenly burst in to rob them. The bandits produced firearms and ordered the men and women not to move, forcing them to hand over valuables. After searching for about half an hour, they withdrew to make their escape. But the housewife, Ms. Gu Cui, age 27, unable to bear seeing her possessions stolen, immediately gave chase and cried for help. The thieves, in a panic, turned and fired a shot, which struck her in the chest. She collapsed at once, and the bandits escaped with the loot. Afterwards, her family appealed to the concession authorities for assistance and called for an ambulance, which transported her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. It is understood that the wound is in a critical area and her life hangs in the balance; the loss is considerable.

### Exhibit of Calligraphy and Painting Through the Ages: Reflections After Viewing

— Zhaoping  
— Enough to Arouse National Consciousness —

An exhibition of Chinese calligraphy and painting through the ages was held on the fourth floor of the Daxin Building to support the medical relief movement. I managed to visit twice and encountered many priceless works by masters who have reached the highest pinnacles of the art—works on which millennia have already passed judgment. I need not expound on their artistic merits here. What I wish to discuss are the exhibition’s manifestations of spirit in various respects.

Collectors’ Spirit Manifestation  
Chinese collectors have long been prone to hoarding secretly and taking pride in it without sharing their treasures. At this exhibition, however, contributors such as Pang Xuzhai, Pu Xiyuan, Wu Hufan, Liu Haisu, and Ding Huikang—all renowned collectors—loaned works by celebrated masters from the Song dynasty (Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, Mi Fu, Cai Xiang), the four masters of the late Yuan (Huang Gongwang, Wu Zhen, Wang Meng, Ni Zan), the four masters of the Ming (Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, Qiu Ying), and the famous “Four Wangs” of the Qing dynasty—each with masterpieces fully representative of their eras and careers. It was unprecedented in previous calligraphy and painting exhibitions to see such renowned collectors openly offering such famous works. The reason lies entirely in these major collectors’ enthusiasm for public welfare, enabling them to break the old habits and display such openness. I hope all collectors in society will take this exhibition as an example, generously share their treasured collections, and hold public exhibitions. Such actions would be immeasurably meritorious in promoting academic culture and benefiting society.

Artists’ Spirit Manifestation  
Individual art reflects the artist’s spirit, and a nation’s art reflects its national spirit. Thus, an artist’s achievements naturally embody not only their personal spirit but also the eternal spirit of the nation. At a time when our country faces crisis, when rivers and mountains are shattered and our valiant soldiers are shedding blood for the final victory, yet on this isolated island many sing and dance in oblivion, living anesthetized lives; and many secretly bend the knee to serve the enemy, tasting the flavor of slavery, nearly extinguishing the national soul. This exhibition, held in such an atmosphere, although primarily aimed at advancing medical relief, carries two profound meanings: first, by presenting works of past masters, it affirms the national soul and awakens us to the heavy responsibility of carrying that soul forward, never again to live in drunken dreams; second, among the works are many by loyal and righteous heroes whose virtues blaze like the sun. It is not merely their achievements that are on display but their characters. When we view the calligraphy of Huang Daozhou of the late Ming or the paintings of Ni Yuanlu, we are reminded of their loyalty, courage, and unyielding integrity, which instantly stirs our spirits and makes us feel that, even if we cannot all become battlefield heroes, we must at least preserve our personal integrity, striving to be people of unwavering principle. Thus, on this isolated island and in a time when the government calls for a nationwide spiritual mobilization, this exhibition not only celebrates the great national spirit but also showcases the greatness of individual moral character—truly providing the spiritual nourishment most needed by those on this island today.

Audience’s Spirit Manifestation  
Both times I visited, the exhibition hall was packed. In these hard times when a meal is not easily come by, people still willingly spend money—to appreciate and study such rare artistic works, yes, but fundamentally driven by a desire to contribute to medical relief for compatriots in need. The audience’s enthusiastic response exemplifies this spirit of benevolence and mutual aid. With such spirit, what cannot be achieved?

### Proceedings of Our Publication’s Second Symposium on Balancing Commodity Prices (Record of the First Session) – Why Are Prices Soaring?

Date    From 10:00 a.m. on the 16th of this month

Location    Conference Hall, Fifth Floor, Shen Bao

Attendees    Cheng Shaode; Zhang Sumin; Yu Dingyi; Wang Haibo; Zhang Mumin; Nie Guangdi; Wang Yutong; Zhu Sihuang; Wei Youqi; Wang Fuli; Shi Huikang; Zhang Wuyun; Zhao Jianzi; Shen Zhenyi; Zhang Yifan (Li); Xu Dingchen (Li); Wu Guanzhou (Li); Li Quanshi; Liu Xingchen; Pan Yangyao; Sun Liyu

Zhang Yifan: I am deeply honored that you gentlemen have sacrificed your rest time to attend our paper’s symposium on the issue of commodity prices. With prices soaring so dramatically, the problem no longer concerns only consumers feeling the strain—producers feel the pressure too. It affects not just the livelihoods of our people but also the fate of the entire national economy and our wartime economy. Our citizens, for the sake of the country, are willing to endure any sacrifice. Yet within reason, we must strive to minimize waste of our nation’s economic strength. The central government has already resolved to implement plans to stabilize domestic prices; but Shanghai’s situation is unique. Apart from each private sector assuming its wartime duty and jointly undertaking price‑stabilization work, we seem left only with watching prices continue to rise. In wartime Shanghai, though its economic position has fallen somewhat from pre‑war levels, its influence over the country’s economy remains formidable. We can see from many facts that Shanghai’s prices govern those in the interior—cotton yarn is one example. Shanghai’s special circumstances render central policy less effective. Up to now, the private sector’s response to high prices has been purely passive endurance. Though admirable in spirit, it is too passive and ultimately too dangerous for the future. Thus, from the standpoint of our citizens and of the academic community, we must devise and promote solutions. That is why our paper has so earnestly centered this symposium on the issue of price stabilization. We believe that in today’s Shanghai, to balance prices we need the concerted effort of all industries—only then can we achieve anything. In drawing up our invitation list, we gave this much thought. Each of you is an expert who has conducted specialized research on various industries, on particular goods, and on general pricing. Not only do you all possess rich experience, you also have broad economic learning. In addition, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Zhu Boquan, Mr. Yao Qingsan, Mr. Pan Hengqin, Mr. Liu Tiesun, Mr. Xie Juzeng, Mr. Zhu Gengxin, and several others, though unable to attend today due to other engagements, have submitted written opinions, for which we are deeply grateful. Now, I invite each gentleman to take the pulse of our prices:

Wei Youqi: I believe today’s domestic price surge can be observed from two angles. In urban areas—namely the treaty ports—transportation remains largely unobstructed, so material allocation is comparatively easy, unlike in the interior. The causes of rising urban prices are: (1) the black‑market exchange rate has depreciated, and since most urban goods relate to foreign exchange, this invisibly drives up prices; (2) inland transport is cut off, so local produce cannot flow freely into Shanghai; (3) other factors, such as increases in certain weaving‑duty surcharges, also play a role. As for the interior’s price surge, it is mostly due to insufficient supplies and maladjusted distribution—other causal factors are relatively minor. Wartime price rises, whether or not beneficial to daily life, arguably create a favorable environment for domestic industrial development. Regarding price balancing, in Shanghai it seems not yet feasible; in the interior the focus must be on economizing and expanding local productive capacity. Private self‑regulatory methods can only involve economizing campaigns—this is indeed what civilians should undertake in wartime.

Zhang Wuyun: Since the war began, prices have continued to rise. Many analysts attribute this entirely to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange; in fact, price increases are not uniform. Rice, for example, has not soared greatly, and cotton yarn fluctuates independently of foreign exchange. In Shanghai there are four primary causes of rising prices: First, reduced production—pre‑war inland cotton‑yarn mills have all shut down, and even in the Yangshupu district only foreign firms are operating. As a result, all regions rely solely on the yarn mills within the Shanghai Concessions, and if transport is unobstructed, yarn prices shoot upward. At one point, a single bale reached 500 yuan; only when river transport was blocked did prices fall. Other manufactured goods show the same trend. Second, diminished supply—cotton cannot arrive in Shanghai from the occupied interior, and massive Japanese purchases further push the price up; the same applies to beef hides, tung oil, and others. Before the war reached Shanghai, rice once surged above 20 yuan per dan due to blocked supply; though government controls proved ineffective, once supply lines reopened last year, wholesale prices hovered around 12 yuan, lower than the controlled price. This shows how supply interruptions relate directly to prices. Third, population changes—since the war, Shanghai has become a refuge for displaced people, greatly expanding consumption of all goods, driving up prices of vegetables, medicines, and so on. Fourth, the emergence of a black‑market for foreign exchange—exchange rates have fallen to about eight pence, so import prices rise, and export goods also climb since exchange conversions become profitable, as with raw silk and cocoons. These four causes together have produced today’s soaring prices. Broadly speaking, foreign‑exchange fluctuations are not the sole driver; the intrinsic supply‑and‑demand dynamics of each good sometimes lie beyond exchange‑rate influence. Overall, reduced production is the greatest single cause of price rises; the others follow in importance.

Cheng Shaode: The impact of currency on Shanghai prices is relatively small because, after the war, Shanghai’s currency supply has not significantly increased; during certain periods it has even contracted, due to the implementation of financial stabilization measures that restrict money shipments to Shanghai. Judging by currency circulation: both the volume of market tokens and their velocity are well below pre‑war levels. Pre‑war, Shanghai Bank bill‑exchange totals reached up to 30 million yuan daily; now the high is only around 10 million. Shanghai prices may not be directly driven by currency supply, but there are two indirect effects: (1) the fall in foreign exchange raises import prices, indirectly lifting domestic prices; (2) increased population coupled with scarce goods—currency and goods out of balance, so prices rise proportionally. Yet this is not solely due to money supply. As for the causes of Shanghai’s price surge: (1) supply controls and shortages; (2) increased transport and handling charges; (3) higher production costs; (4) foreign‑exchange depreciation raising import costs, indirectly affecting some domestic goods; (5) merchant speculation; (6) market psychology. From the experts’ earlier reports on various goods’ price rises, we can condense our conclusions into these points. Remedies rely partly on public opinion campaigns and partly on industry associations’ self‑regulation. Yet they can only curb speculation and market panic; they cannot effectively address the other causes of price increases.

Wang Yutong: Wartime domestic price surges—especially those in Shanghai—stem primarily from abnormal supply and demand. Government controls on foreign exchange have sparked violent black‑market fluctuations, fueling distorted price rises. According to our surveys: (1) Of twenty‑four major agricultural products, twenty‑two have risen in price, most notably green tea, tobacco leaves, tung oil, raw silk, and more recently linseed and soybean oils; (2) Of nine important industrial goods, imports—such as pigments, chemical raw materials, hardware, and paper—have surged most severely, followed by cloth and cotton yarn; (3) Of seven key mineral products, none have escaped rises, especially coal, which has shot up 150 percent, and other rates range from 10 percent to over 150 percent. There are five principal causes, of which the fifth is most striking: (1) transport blockages hindering smooth supply; (2) large quantities of goods stranded in war zones or the interior, creating shortages; (3) production areas destroyed and supplies cut off; (4) government controls on foreign exchange, a shrinking official market, and merchants seizing opportunities for speculation; (5) the recent runaway surges in linseed and soybean oils, where supply authority lies not with us but with others. Rogue elements in the trade have fanned the flames of speculation for profit.

Zhao Jianzi: The earlier analyses of high prices have been very thorough, and I greatly admire them. From an economic perspective, current price surges can be classified into (1) currency causes and (2) commodity causes. According to the quantity‑theory of money, if fiat‑currency issuance doesn’t expand, its value shouldn’t fall. In China, from the introduction of the currency law until the control of foreign exchange, issuance steadily increased yet the currency didn’t depreciate—this reflects the abolition of old notes and their replacement with new currency. Simultaneously, the price index rose—not due to monetary expansion but because of global price increases. Wartime issuance did climb, but this is unrelated to today’s price surges, since Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and even parts of Sichuan adopted the new currency, expanding its circulation area; issuance grew only in step with demand, not due to so‑called inflation. In occupied zones and the interior, many notes were destroyed by shelling. After the war, commercial credit halted and cash transactions resumed, also increasing currency circulation. In sum, post‑war currency issuance rose because of an expanded circulation area, but this cannot be taken as proof that currency expansion caused soaring prices. So where do post‑war price surges come from? As earlier speakers said: commodity supply–demand imbalances, merchant hoarding, transport blockages, delayed shipments, and so on—they all fall under commodity causes. Additionally, I believe taxes and public levies—such as taxation and military‑risk surcharges—have also driven prices upward.

Zhang Sumin: Shanghai’s price rise differs from that of the interior. Domestic goods there have risen due to supply–demand imbalances: raw materials have decreased or inland sources have dried up. Imported goods have climbed because domestic currency has depreciated against foreign exchange. There has been no real currency inflation in Shanghai; the financial authorities have pursued a contractionary policy, as is well known. In the interior, price rises also stem mainly from supply–demand imbalances. Manufactured goods there historically depended on Yangtze‑region factories; after that region’s occupation, supply was cut or transport made difficult, so prices rose. Local staple products don’t necessarily rise in their home region but do rise elsewhere due to transport difficulties. As for imported goods inland, strict government controls have all but ended civilian imports, save for military supplies. Major inland export products—like tea leaves and tung oil—are fully monopolized by the government for export, leaving little for civilian use, so their domestic prices have risen; yet regulated prices are hard to enforce. Because the price problem is complex, controls must be implemented separately by commodity. In Shanghai, aside from rice, which the Concession authorities regulate, other prices are beyond their reach. In the interior, various localities have indeed implemented price controls.

Pan Yangyao: Prices in both the interior and Shanghai have risen over the past two years, with the interior surging more sharply. Causes are: (1) transport difficulties, where freight sometimes costs several times the product’s value; (2) exchange relations—strict Ministry of Finance controls on foreign remittances are necessary to prevent capital flight to occupied areas. Currently, the China–Central–Agricultural Bank limits remittances to 5,000 yuan per branch per day. Thus, when local merchants ship goods inland and remit funds back to Shanghai, not only is the exchange rate over 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan (about 110 yuan on drafts, 160 yuan on telegraphic transfers) but the process is very difficult—raising prices. (3) The interior also imposes trade controls and levies on incoming goods, invisibly pushing prices up. (4) Military aircraft attacks create transport hazards, reducing inland shipments and inviting speculative markups by those risking the journey. (5) Beyond exchange controls, the government has placed many commodities under direct regulation; merchants, finding no profit, avoid trading these, thinning supply and creating upward pressure. (6) Many factories’ raw materials rely on foreign exchange; as the exchange rate falls, their costs rise. In Shanghai, a sudden doubling of population and skewed social developments further complicate price rises. Still, since interior remittances have been restricted, merchants find it unprofitable to send goods inland, and instead bring interior goods out-of-region—this has unintentionally limited further price increases, though the effect is slight.

Nie Guangdi: Many causes underlie post‑war price surges; your broad analyses have been very thorough. I would like to add one point. While supply–demand imbalances are certainly the primary cause, transport blockages and shipment difficulties that hamper cargo delivery also readily spur price rises. Take agricultural products: one region may have abundant output, depressing prices there, while another region, in urgent need and faced with supply obstructions, sees prices skyrocket—but because transport is so difficult, no equilibration occurs between the two regions. High interior exchange costs affect all inland freight costs. For example, Chongqing’s remittance charge to Shanghai is over 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan; when merchants purchase goods in Shanghai to ship to Chongqing, they must add this 10 percent surcharge to their costs, thus raising selling prices. Furthermore, along the route various levies and surcharges, plus insurance for transport and military‑risk fees, accumulate—how can prices not soar? A previous speaker mentioned foreign‑exchange effects; this is indeed a factor, but I think its impact on domestic raw materials is small, and on manufactured products greater; imported foreign goods need not be said. For instance, in many rice‑producing regions, pre‑war rice sold for 7 or 8 yuan per dan and now remains about the same—it has not risen simply because our currency’s foreign‑exchange rate is tighter. By contrast, after the July 7 Incident, cotton prices in the Longhai Railway region collapsed for lack of buyers, yet yarn and cloth from Shanghai and Hankou mills continued climbing. Supply–demand relations are paramount—but mill machinery parts and hardware must be paid for in foreign exchange, so manufactured‑goods costs rise correspondingly. Thus, I believe foreign exchange influences domestic prices chiefly in an indirect manner. Currency effects on prices are significant, as several colleagues noted. Although government issuance of new currency has increased post‑war, market token circulation in Shanghai is not only below pre‑war levels but appears tighter. Yet people, fearing inflation or mistrusting the new notes, have hoarded many goods; merchants have meanwhile stirred speculation for profit, causing many items to rise, as our chairman said—a purely monetary form of price hike. Thus, I think in Shanghai hoarding by outsiders and speculative manipulation by insiders greatly influence many price increases. Regardless of all causes, letting prices run rampant is wrong and seriously affects social stability and common livelihoods. Shanghai, with over 5 million residents, has many latent problems. We should seek a plan to curb these price surges.

Li Quanshi: To balance interior prices, we must resolve transport‑line issues. To balance Shanghai prices, population must be dispersed. Expecting industry associations to self‑regulate is like “negotiating with a tiger.” They are busy profiting from national calamity—who will forego a chance to get rich? Regarding luxury goods, we might as well let their prices rise; when they become too expensive, people naturally economize and prices will fall. In fact, any efforts to artificially balance them are futile.

Zhang Mumin: Stable prices greatly benefit the populace. But political power is indispensable. Since Shanghai cannot wield political authority, cooperation among all parties to implement autonomous regulation is necessary. Yet the core cause of Shanghai’s price surge is speculative manipulation. Regulated by merchants and self‑regulating by merchants, such efforts will have little effect. In truth, we might just let Shanghai’s prices rise naturally, because the concentration of population in Shanghai is itself unreasonable. However, if essential daily‑use goods remain expensive, the economic future of this society is in grave danger.

Wang Haibo: Wartime price surges have many causes. For example: Shanghai’s transport to the interior is cut off—that’s a transport cause; the new currency has fallen to eight pence on the black market—that’s a foreign‑exchange cause; Shanghai’s sudden population rise to 5 million—that’s a population cause; higher freight, insurance, and interest rates—that’s a cost cause; the large demand for military supplies—that’s a military‑needs cause; merchants hoarding for speculation—that’s a manipulation cause; plus factory destructions, shifts in manufacturers and laborers, government controls on goods in occupied zones, myriad levies on transport, and so on. Analyzing these, we can list perhaps twenty causes. Yet by standard economic classification, they fall into three categories: (1) surging demand—including population, military needs, and hoarding; (2) sharply reduced supply—including destroyed factories, halted production, transport blockages, and lost production areas; (3) breakdowns in the medium of exchange—namely, currency value collapses. In peacetime, demand and supply determine prices and can balance each other; but in wartime, demand keeps rising while supply rapidly falls, so the two cannot balance, and prices soar. In this severe situation, a third factor emerges: faults in the exchange process. We know that the medium of exchange and the standard for measuring prices is money. When war causes money to collapse, prices naturally rise. As for which cause is strongest, one cannot generalize—they interact in complex ways. In studying them, we can use three criteria: (1) by commodity category—imports are most hit by foreign‑exchange, interior goods by transport blockages, occupied‑zone goods by levies and controls; (2) by region—Shanghai and the interior differ: Shanghai prices rose quickly, the interior more slowly, even falling in some areas; (3) by time—depending on military events and public psychology: when military fortunes improve, prices stabilize; when fortunes decline, prices change rapidly. Price research requires time and detailed analysis; my observations are naturally shallow. But broadly, I hold that price surges stem from three root causes: (1) surging demand; (2) plunging supply; (3) currency‑value collapse. These three factors ebb and flow with time and commodity. Therefore, in our research we should analyze according to those three standards—by category, by region, and by time—to reach more accurate conclusions.

Zhu Sihuang: We cannot generalize about causes of price rises—differences in region and commodity type are vital. For example, Shanghai prices are inevitably influenced by currency conditions, while special forces or unique causes can also disturb the market. Inland price rises stem mostly from transport blockages, so imported goods cost less in Shanghai than inland, whereas domestic goods cost less inland than in Shanghai. Another important point: in normal times, price stability is maintained by a balance of supply and demand power. When prices fall, demand power dominates; when they rise, supply power does. Now that price rises are under way, the power of suppliers—hoarding, speculation, and manipulation—is the major factor driving prices still higher. Regarding currency, we see how such speculation gains force: normally in inflation, people’s incomes rise, stimulating daily necessities demand and raising prices. China’s wartime currency cannot be said to inflate massively, but the tightening of black‑market exchange does reflect some inflation. Yet Chinese incomes have shrunk with widespread pay cuts, reducing consumption. On one hand, military needs force savings; on the other, inflation encourages hoarding and speculative manipulation. In both goods and financial markets, speculators make great fortunes at national expense, pushing prices ever higher. Thus, from the currency side, consumers are far weaker than suppliers in wielding price control. So in Shanghai today, the most noteworthy cause of price rises is the power of suppliers—hoarding and speculation.

Zhang Yifan: Observing the separate price indices by category, though the rates of increase vary, the consistent trend is upward. Aside from speculative items—such as cash, government bonds, and certain yarns and cotton bales—whose price curves show some fluctuations, other categories have risen in a straight line. Even those with curved trends—aside from securities—when compared month to month or quarter to quarter, continue rising step by step. Broadly speaking, import prices rise linearly, and domestic‑product prices rise in a curved manner. Explaining this by the fall in exchange rates is reasonable: once black‑market rates began to drop and then steadied around eight pence, import prices initially rose in a straight line and should have later shown variation. But did they? I hope that those present who have specialized research on various commodities can offer detailed reports.

Liu Xingchen: Domestic price trends differ greatly across regions—in cities they generally rise, in rural areas they generally fall. The inability of goods to flow freely is a wartime phenomenon, and among all factors, transport plays the greatest role in price changes. Allow me to report on interior prices based on my knowledge: in Henan, eggs now sell at 150 per yuan, fish at 10 jin per yuan… (Editor’s note: Mr. Liu had a detailed report and analysis, regrettably omitted here in full; we apologize and hope Mr. Liu will forgive us.)

Wang Fuli: The commodity with the sharpest price surge today may be cotton cloth. A single piece of 20‐count “Jincheng” cotton cloth now costs 520 yuan, more than double pre‐war prices. Foreign‑exchange contraction, transport difficulties, rising costs, and so on all play a role. But the largest cause is greatly reduced textile‑mill output—mills have shut or been destroyed, cutting production and creating shortages. I will submit a separate written report on the wartime damage to China’s textile‑manufacturing equipment and the current situation. Here I only urge everyone to pay attention to the fact of this production shortfall.

Nie Guangdi: Shanghai and the interior cannot be compared—Shanghai’s circumstances are unique. In a warring nation, major commodities would all be government‑controlled; but what of Shanghai? Has it ever functioned like a city fighting for its life and death? Ordinary merchants, feeling their own safety assured, pursue profits without regard for national interest or public livelihood. Within the Concessions, the Chinese government lacks authority and cannot implement controls. The Concession authorities have at least limited rice prices, but on essential clothing and housing they let prices soar unchecked. Public transit fares—trams and buses—have fortunately not risen much, and even if they did, what recourse would ordinary citizens have?

I have said before that merchant speculation is a major cause of price rises. Take cotton cloth: Shanghai remains a production center, and merchants exploit the interior’s urgent need by selling at high prices. Before Guangzhou’s fall, mills could net over 200 yuan profit per piece; now they clear 70 to 80 yuan. Cloth traders shipping inland naturally add their own margin; when supply is scarce they even monopolize for speculation. Compare the price of one piece of 20‐count cotton cloth in Shanghai and in the interior: in Shanghai it now sells for about 390 yuan, in Kunming around 700 yuan, in Chongqing 850 to 860 yuan, and in Wanxian 950 yuan—more than double Shanghai’s price. Even accounting for costs, the freight and associated fees from Shanghai to those interior destinations are staggering. For example, shipping one piece of 20‑count cotton cloth to Kunming incurs approximately:
  
  Freight (loading and unloading)    59.50 yuan  
  Taxes and levies (rebated tariff, unified tax, consumption tax)    55.10 yuan  
  En‑route losses (damaged bales, broken yarn)    8.00 yuan  
  Warehouse rent and insurance    3.70 yuan  
  Remittance fees and interest    93.50 yuan  

Assuming a base cost of 395 yuan, the total landed cost in Yunnan is 615 yuan; at a selling price of 700 yuan, the merchant nets 85 yuan. Shipping to Chongqing adds at least another 150 yuan in freight and handling, yet even at today’s market price, there remains profit to be made.

Yu Dingyi: The causes of price rises are extremely complex. We must view wartime vs. pre‑war, interior vs. Shanghai, domestic vs. foreign goods, domestic vs. export, regulated vs. unregulated—all together and separately. First, pre‑war price rises stemmed mainly from monetary reforms; post‑war rises stem from the expanding war, causing production halts, supply‑demand imbalances, transport difficulties, and cost increases—so price rises are an inevitable result. Second, interior price rises spring primarily from transport barriers creating shortages, while Shanghai’s rises result from concentrated population and surging demand. Superficially both are due to supply‑demand relations, but essentially they differ: if interior transport improved and freight fell, and if Shanghai’s population were dispersed, price rises would immediately halt. Third, locally produced and consumed goods mostly haven’t risen—like interior agricultural products and Shanghai tobacco and soap—yet when exported they soar; only in overly concentrated cities like Chongqing, Kunming, and Shanghai do even local sales see rises. Fourth, comparing domestic and foreign goods, the former soar because production falls short, the latter because of exorbitant exchange rates; domestic goods are also pushed higher by foreign‑goods price rises, though to a lesser degree. Fifth, regulation or laissez‑faire affects trends—Shanghai rice once climbed to 20 yuan but, upon setting a 14 yuan ceiling, stabilized. Other necessities poised within the purchasing power of the public still trend upward. From these analyses, we see that production declines, transport woes, population concentration, foreign‑exchange highs, supply‑demand imbalances, and rising costs have all come together to produce today’s unprecedented price surge. To balance prices proactively, we must focus on boosting productive capacity and improving transport—without goods to ship, or the ability to ship them, people naturally resort to speculative hoarding. Passively, we must advocate economizing and vigorously implement price‑control policies—the former is easy to promote, the latter more difficult but not impossible; Shanghai’s rice‑price cap is one example. Similar controls on other necessities are indeed necessary. As for luxury goods, we might temporarily let them rise, allowing their own high prices to impose a natural limit. Additionally, harnessing public‐opinion power to launch economizing campaigns and promote price controls on necessities should yield results greater than the effort invested.

Shen Zhenyi: If we compare the rise rates of various commodities, agricultural and industrial goods have risen most sharply. Based on my data:

(1) Among agricultural products, tobacco leaves and tung oil have soared over 200 percent since mid‑April this year compared to pre‑war levels; tung oil up 188 percent; green tea up 150 percent; dried cocoons up 120 percent; raw oil up 93 percent; cotton (lint) up 84 percent. Other items—beef hides, sesame, timber, etc.—have risen between 77 percent and 53 percent, while about ten products have increases below 50 percent.

(2) Among industrial goods, raw silk has jumped 161 percent; pigments 88 percent; in hardware, lead wire 70 percent; in chemical materials, caustic soda nearly 97 percent; in textiles, fine cloth 55 percent. Eleven other industrial items have rises below 47 percent.

(3) In mineral products, coal has the highest increase—from 118 percent to 138 percent; diesel 71 percent; kerosene 64 percent; tin 67 percent; antimony 60 percent; gasoline, litharge, pig iron, etc., have risen between 16 percent and 33 percent.

Summarizing these key agricultural, industrial, and mineral items: of those above 200 percent, all are agricultural; between 150 percent and 200 percent, two agricultural and one industrial; above 100 percent, one agricultural and two mineral; above 50 percent, seven agricultural, six industrial, and five mineral; the rest are under 50 percent. Among these high‑rise items, many are export goods—like tung oil, raw silk, tea, hides, and antimony—which benefit exports and we won’t dwell on them here. But coal, linseed and soybean oils, cotton, cotton yarn, cloth, sesame, pulses, etc., are daily necessities central to people’s clothing and food, yet they too are climbing. The recent surge in raw and soybean oils is particularly alarming, greatly aggravating the hardships of daily life—especially for the many unemployed Shanghai refugees on this island. The impact on social order and stability is alarming and merits our deepest concern.

### Sexual Knowledge Can Guide Us into the Paradise of Love!
— Dr. Yang Daonan, Medical Graduate of the Russian Workers’ University

The famous Italian scholar Hitchmaund once said, “If we wish to step securely into the paradise of love, we need a certain knowledge of sex to guide our progress.” Such knowledge concerns the healthy secrets of marital happiness that every young person needs upon reaching physiological maturity.

The field of sexual health is indeed vast. Among its many aspects, the study of venereal diseases and all knowledge regarding sexuality are especially important because they are closely related to our daily lives.

In the modern society of surging new trends, young people lacking sexual knowledge often overindulge to their detriment, causing needless troubles and sinking into suffering. This not only damages their own health but also jeopardizes the love between husband and wife. Young people ought to pay the utmost attention to this matter.

If one understands that semen is life and health is love, one will know that excessive indulgence is unwise. Therefore, hygiene during adolescence must not be ignored. Normal development generally occurs because the adolescent glands secrete a fluid that promotes whole‑body metabolism and benefits genital development. But if one injures oneself through overindulgence or sexual debauchery, one loses this secretion. As a result, metabolism slows, development halts, and sexual function weakens, leading to premature ejaculation, impotence, and recurrent suffering. The wife then resents and curses you, and looks down on you; a once joyful union goes bankrupt—this misery is self‑inflicted!

When I was in America, I learned that these conditions can only be reversed by actively using endocrine therapy. After returning home, I achieved remarkable results in clinical practice. Among endocrine treatments, the best is the testicular essence preparation “Butikang,” because its effects are long‑lasting. After taking it, sexual function immediately becomes vigorous, neurasthenia is relieved, development is promoted, and whole‑body nutrition improves. In clinical trials, the drug begins acting within sixty minutes, and within twenty‑four hours it works on spermatogenesis and blood enrichment. For women, “Butikang” regulates menstruation. It is likewise a wonder for couples weakened by illness.

### Cough Suppression and Tuberculosis Treatment
— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

One should know that today’s cough, if not treated quickly, becomes tomorrow’s pulmonary tuberculosis. Although modern scientific therapies can curb it, time and money spent on treatment inevitably increase greatly. The ideal approach is to treat the cough itself. If one misses treatment during the cough stage and lung disease then flares, the medicine “Bufei Nair” has a special effect on pulmonary disease. Its plant‑based formula has a pure and excellent bactericidal action against tubercle bacilli. This remedy is the result of many years of research by Dr. Tumai, who used precious mineral and plant ingredients, repeatedly tested on animals, and improved step by step. Therefore, “Bufei Nair” has exceptionally pure efficacy. Its rapid cough suppression and phlegm‑liquefying action are not merely temporary anesthetic effects.

Modern Medicine

### Controlling the Rampant Gonococcus
— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American MD

The aggressive and rampant gonococcus has cost countless lives and ruined many marriages. In medicine, no researcher has failed to seek a specific cure for gonorrhea, yet none succeeded. This is because most scholars, not understanding the gonococcus’s life conditions, relied on incorrect theories and superficial techniques that could never achieve the goal.

In fact, the pathogen in gonorrhea is the diplococcus, which is highly resistant, able to withstand high heat and low cold, and has weak antitoxic defenses. Thus gonorrhea patients often feel helpless. But this difficulty has now been completely solved. Based on bacteriology and immunology, Dr. Peter learned how the gonococcus lives in the human body and, using a non‑specific therapy of protein mixed with a yellow pigment, created the specific anti‑gonorrhea drug “Klininon.” After taking it, within hours the body’s cells produce an anti‑gonococcal phagocytic action that rushes to the infection site to surround and destroy the bacteria. Where ordinary patent medicines fail, “Klininon” achieves a fundamental cure. Through repeated trials, I have never been disappointed. Used together with “Anti‑Gonorrhea Wash” for urethral rinsing, and in women with gonococcal leucorrhea to cleanse the discharge, the damaged vagina quickly recovers. Even the most stubborn gonorrhea can then be eradicated. Since returning from America, I have cured countless cases. I sincerely offer this experience to sufferers.

### On Women’s Masturbatory Practices
— Dr. Zheng Ting, German MD

Many young people, because of physiological needs, poor environments, and weak willpower, stray into sexual paths and fall into the bad habit of masturbation. Among physiologically mature women, cases are not few, yet female masturbation has received virtually no study. Women’s physiological differences mean its harms are less evident than in men, so women may indulge excessively. Their greater sense of shame leads them to keep silent about the damage. Consequently, some regard female masturbation as unbelievable. But these skeptics usually lack study of physiological hygiene. Medical experts have long known that female masturbation is rising and see it as a major threat to women’s health and happiness.

Women masturbate mostly due to sexual dissatisfaction or genital inflammation. The greatest harm is enlargement of the labia and damage to the clitoris, leading to anorgasmia. Uterine inflammation, physical weakness, breast atrophy, loss of beauty, and menstrual disorders also follow excessive masturbation. Its severity rivals male damage from nocturnal emissions. I earnestly advise self‑stimulating women to stop immediately. They should take the female form of “Butikang” to enhance health and beauty and regulate menstruation. This ovarian endocrine remedy is superb for rejuvenation. Men harmed by masturbation can take the male “Butikang” to replenish losses; those with nocturnal emissions may also take “Neers Emission Tablets.”

### Hazards of Leukorrhea and Prostatic Fluid
— Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic... No. 9 Ningbo Road, at Sichuan Road Junction

Everyone knows that life begins with the sperm produced in the testes; sperm are the fundamental element of biological life. But another substance is of equal importance: prostatic fluid. In prostatitis, sperm depend on this fluid; without it, they lose motility and perish. Thus prostatic fluid is second only to sperm in reproductive importance.

Gonorrhea’s virulent pathogen and widespread toxins easily invade the prostate, causing gonococcal prostatitis, which risks infertility. This demands urgent treatment. In over twenty years of clinical practice, I have developed special expertise in treating gonococcal prostatitis. The prostate is a key organ in the genital tract but, with proper treatment, is not difficult to cure. I routinely apply German electrotherapy to deliver bactericidal action directly to the lesion and use the holy cure for gonorrhea, “Klininon,” to eliminate gonococci at their source within the tissues. Because “Klininon” is a protein‑yellow pigment complex, it has an anti‑gonococcal phagocytic function that mobilizes all cells to surround and destroy the bacteria, leaving none to escape. Thus prostatitis‑induced reproductive dysfunction is completely cured, and the prostate regains its secretory function, ending the agony of infertility. In over twenty years, I have never failed. Clinic hours: 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; closed Sunday afternoons. Effective immediately, twenty patients are accepted daily; fee per patient: ¥0.5.

### Finance: Stability of British Fine Gold

In the spot cash and dark‐market gold markets, due to the weekly holiday and recent market quiet, only one or two members attended, and none had buy or sell positions, so there were no price calls. It is reported that money‐exchange houses also saw little activity; the price remained stuck around ¥2,070.

Jewelry gold at pawnshops remains at the original selling price: major firms at ¥210 per tael, new firms at ¥208, purchase at ¥202.

London, 22nd: British fine gold per ounce remains unchanged at £7 s 8 d½.

### Long‐Dated Silver Futures Further Contraction

London, 22nd: In the silver market, U.S. merchants are buying, Indian traders and speculators are selling; trading is limited and the market is calm. Do not touch near‐dated silver futures; long‐dated contracts contracted further by 0.0625. New York: U.S. spot prices remain flat. Bombay: Indian silver market turns stable; both spot and futures unchanged.

### List of Clearing Banks

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee’s Bill Exchange Office has flourished. Previously, interbank settlements in Shanghai relied on money houses’ transfers. With the Exchange Office, banks exchange bills directly, simplifying procedures. To facilitate the trade, it also handles transfers for money houses, other financial businesses, and nonbank bills. Many banks not yet members open accounts with the Exchange Office for convenience, and some money houses do likewise to process bill collections. Below is a list of current clearing banks, agent clearing banks, branches, and commissioned banks:

### Grain: No Significant Movement in Local Rice

Yesterday, mills supplied Japonica rice from lower‑river regions (23 loads), Carriage Wheel Baozi, Su group sent over 2,000 bags; Kunshan group 500 bags; Changzhou group 250 bags. Arrivals remain sparse, and as storerooms continuously release stocks, inventories grow thin. Sellers hold firm, but buyers, enjoying warm weather, hesitate to purchase heavily. Thus street‑level demand is ordinary, speculators receive little inquiry, and prices for thick or thin Japonica rice stay fixed. High‑grade Dosha Japonica remains similar; trade continues moderately; market tone is slightly calmer, with no significant shifts.

### Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Trading Booms with Over 2,000 Bags Opened

Yesterday the sugar market remained firm; domestic sugar trading was very active, with over 2,000 bags opened. Premium three‑spike sugar sold at ¥24.80 and ¥24.20 per bag; refined ICE sugar at ¥14.00; next grade at ¥23.10; high‑grade white at ¥22.00—a total of over 1,000 bags. Ordinary foreign sugar at ¥17.00, next at ¥16.40—over 200 bags; ordinary brown sugar at ¥15.00 and ¥14.70—700–800 bags; 200 bags of Huangjiang green sugar at ¥14.80–14.90. Prices of foreign sugars saw little change due to the weekly cycle.

### Coal: Lesser‑Quality Anthracite Coal Trading Slow

Lesser‑quality anthracite coal, due to scant arrivals last winter, sold briskly at elevated prices above premium Huángméng coal. But recently prices have fallen, and trading is slow. Sellers move stocks downstream; dealers cut prices. At Hongji No. 1 terminal, lesser coal sells at ¥44 per ton; Henan coal at ¥42; Haifeng coal at ¥43—all delivered to foreign warehouses, with additional handling fees.

### Dried Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Now for Sale

Western sea cucumber has recently arrived steadily. A batch was opened for sale: grade A jade at ¥133; second‑grade jade at ¥123; No. 1 jade at ¥110; No. 2 jade at ¥108.60; No. 3 jade at ¥89.60; grade A red at ¥119; second‑grade red at ¥115; No. 1 red at ¥106; central red at ¥86.60; small red at ¥62.20; central bare at ¥158–139; central small bare at ¥116.60; small bare at ¥109.20–104.00. Also a batch of Annan shrimp tails sold as gold hooks at ¥124 per box. It is reported that 3,400 packages of raw starch were imported earlier.

### The Answer of Europe’s Small Nations to Germany
— Mao Lie

Many state affairs are managed by officials who fancy themselves supremely clever, enough to deceive the whole world, yet their results reveal their true intent, obvious to everyone. At the time they provoke universal laughter, and in the future will be endlessly ridiculed—their folly is boundless! I mention only one case: Germany’s questions to Europe’s small nations cannot but prompt such thoughts.

The answers from these small states are in no way surprising. As the Havas Agency in Washington reported: “These small nations, under the threat of a strongman’s gun, were compelled to comply; their replies are surely insincere.” The Paris United Press telegram added: “If they dared give any definite answer to Hitler’s questions, it would be courting trouble.” Clearly, Europe’s clever people are not only Hitler; the leaders of the small states are no fools—they understand that provoking direct trouble is unwise. Yet their “satisfactory” replies to Hitler are no different from no reply at all.

Of course, with these replies, Hitler can address Roosevelt, claiming Roosevelt overstated matters and misdirected concerns, thus avoiding a direct response to Roosevelt’s inquiry. But what will observers think? Will they share his view?

We believe Roosevelt’s proposal was genuinely constructive: he suggested convening an international conference to discuss world affairs fairly, not to pressure Hitler. His questions—whether Germany and Italy would guarantee no aggression for ten or twenty‑five years—were frank and required no evasive detours. Yet Mussolini and Hitler both evaded direct answers. Who still believes they have any sincerity? Who still values their words?

Hitler’s questions, and his possible future response to Roosevelt, may seem clever to him and help his policy. But through this episode, the small nations will surely awaken: under the threat of a gun, they could only yield to the aggressor’s demands; now they will urgently seek stronger defenses and united resistance. And the United States will clearly see that the two fascist states have no remorse but continue aggression; America will thus cooperate even more closely with democratic allies. Trying to outsmart others may yet backfire—perhaps this is the only tactic left to today’s fascist dictators.

### Foolish (Part II)

— Green Leaf

They burst into the ancestral hall and encountered no enemy. When they turned to leave, both front and back doors were sealed by the enemy’s curtain of fire. They had no choice but to stay inside, shifting from attack to defense.

The captain said to the men: “Someone must have leaked our plans. They slipped out ahead of us and have come around to encircle us. What we need most now is to notify our ambush teams at once so they can strike from the rear. Then we will sally out from here in concert with them, trap the enemy, and finish them off.” He then asked, “Which brother is willing to go?”

The gunfire outside was even more intense than inside, for there were several machine guns out there, and the rattle of light field guns mixed in with the rifle shots.

“I’ll go, Captain.”

The captain, hearing that, knew at once it was Wang Benzhong.

“You won’t succeed—you still don’t know how to fire your rifle.”

“I can stab with my knife.” Even in the midst of their peril, everyone couldn’t help but laugh.

After Wang Benzhong volunteered, no one else volunteered to go, so the captain allowed him, giving him some last instructions and calling two brothers to help him climb out over the courtyard wall through a skylight. He hoisted himself onto someone’s shoulders, climbed the wall—unheeding the bullets whistling overhead—slipped quietly to the ground with his knife in hand, and crawled toward the wheat field.

Behind the ancestral hall ran a small river, and on the northwest corner of the hall was a small wooden bridge. Following the captain’s orders, he did not cross the bridge but forded the shallow river. Once ashore, he dashed off toward the stone bridge where most of the ambush was set up, some two or three li away from the wooden bridge. This was the main road into the city, hence the greatest concentration of hidden forces.

He found the squad leader and delivered the captain’s orders. The squad leader immediately sent three men out to alert the other ambush positions to attack in unison, then led his men in a forced run toward the ancestral hall.

At that point, Wang Benzhong had no further instructions. The captain had told him only that much; nothing about his personal role afterward. Naturally, he should have followed the squad leader, but they ran so fast in the darkness that in the blink of an eye he was left behind, alone.

From far off the roar of rifles and cannon made a tremendous din. Clutching his knife, he thought for a moment, his mind turning over something, and decided not to run. After another moment’s thought, he turned back toward the stone bridge and sat down there.

Three or four hours of fighting passed, and dawn was breaking in the east. The gunfire gradually thinned, as if the battle were drawing to a close. Wang Benzhong sat dimly aware, still on the bridge, not moving.

Suddenly, in the faint morning light, he saw figures rushing toward him. He dropped to the ground and peered closely. As they drew nearer, he recognized two men in yellow uniforms. He felt a surge of excitement, gripped his knife tighter, and prepared himself.

When the two yellow-clad soldiers had climbed five or six steps onto the bridge, Wang Benzhong rose silently behind them. As soon as he could reach them, he swung his knife at the neck of the man in the rear. With a fierce blow, the man toppled completely into the river; whether head and body were separated, he could not tell. The front soldier heard the noise and turned—but by then Wang Benzhong had drawn his knife back and thrust it into the man’s abdomen. The soldier collapsed on the bridge, and before he could struggle, Wang Benzhong kicked him into the river as well.

“Damn it, I got them after all.” Wang Benzhong said this as he stepped off the bridge back to his hiding place.

Then he killed three more in the same way—first two at once, then one by one.

When daylight was fully up, he saw his own main force rushing along the road, so he went to meet them. The captain, seeing him, asked:

“No Japanese got through?”

“None,” Wang Benzhong said. “Not a single one.”

“That’s strange. Folks say they saw several of them coming down this road—where have they gone?”

“Captain, they all ended up in the river.”

“What?”

When Wang Benzhong explained, no one could keep from laughing—laughing at how clumsy his story sounded—actually quite clever—and laughing at his accomplishment.

The captain, assured none of the enemy had slipped past, ordered everyone to rest for a while.

“How did you end up hiding here?” the captain asked.

“Because you only ordered me to deliver the message, not to return,” Wang Benzhong stammered shyly. Again there was a burst of laughter.

“You’ve done a fine job; today this is your first great feat.”

“Captain,” Wang Benzhong seemed embarrassed, hesitating over his words: “I really am clumsy—I don’t know how to fire a rifle, only how to stab with a knife. Otherwise...”

His words were lost amid the laughter.

“You’re not clumsy,” the captain hurried to say. “You’re not clumsy—don’t say so!”

From then on, Wang Benzhong acquired a nickname: “Wang Not-Clumsy.”

### Salvation Song Ensemble on the Mainland (Woodcut)

### Silent Wilderness

— Ping

The wind whispers,  
Stars scatter;  
In the silent wilderness  
A single voice is heard—  
Melancholy, forlorn.  
I start in wonder:  
Is it a wanderer with nowhere to rest?  
A drifter in pain and without support?  
Wounded soldiers bidding farewell?  
A lonely soul weeping in tears?  
I urge you:  
Let not your lofty aspirations die,  
No need for tears;  
Stand instead at the forefront of the battle line!  
Vivacious,  
Seize the helm of this era,  
Stride forward in unison—  
Strive! Strive!

### The Untold Story from “The Divine Comedy”

— Yang Yanqi

Dante journeyed through Hell.  
I have also seen stories of hell on earth.

Time: a desolate midnight. Midnight’s atmosphere is already bleak, and with a few drops of drizzle it grows even more somber.  
Place: beside a deserted street. The leaves of the locust trees tremble, rustling like the sighs of ghosts.

I walk at an unhurried, unhurried pace along the roadside. It is still winter; winter’s raindrops are the cruellest things, striking an unprotected head, disheveling one’s hair, dripping down the temples in a tiny waterfall all the way to the eyes. My coat collar is turned up high, yet it cannot block the sharp wind and rain of the winter night. Coldness wants to shake me, but I remain still—walking at that same unhurried, unhurried, moderate pace.

As I round a corner, it grows darker. The streetlamp’s weak glow, shy at my approach, hides behind its gray glass shade, showing only half its light. In the lamp’s glow, I see rain turning into streams of silver threads, slanted in the wind. This is glass, not rain, I think.

There is no one at the street corner; only my own soul remains.

The tree shadows, in the faint light, spread across the ground in patches.

The sky has no color, only black, dark, an emptiness as far as the eye can see.

From afar comes a dog’s bark, breaking the momentary stillness, yet it cannot dispel the bleak air. On this cold, dark, quiet street there is only the lonely figure of a man. Who would have thought that apart from me, there are two hundred million souls in the world!

Look: ahead, at the base of a high gray wall, in a recessed gateway, a dark silhouette flickers. It moves toward me. Yes—a person.

In the tranquil air, there is a stir. In this still realm, two living bodies, two souls.

I look into the light. The figure stands distinctly before me. His face, however, is half-hidden by a leaf that masks the glow so I cannot see him clearly. Only on the dark shape I discern a mass of black hair, a few strands falling over his forehead.

A chill runs through me—let me go. I quicken my stride, take larger steps.

Suddenly, the sound of footsteps behind me, following in my steps. It is the man in black, panting, following me. He utters no sigh, only his footsteps echo faintly in the wind-and-rain’s soft ensemble.

“You still come! My lost life!” He slaps my shoulder and shouts.

I panic and can only laugh.

“My lost life!” he cries, his bloodless throat almost spitting sparks.

“Drunkard!”

“I’m not drunk! I only want the life I lost! My soul! I want you to save me, save me! Return my life, my soul.”

I laugh again and again.

Suddenly, a crumpled piece of white paper is pushed into my hand. In the dim light of the streetlamp, I look. As I read, he slips away, leaving only the echo of his footsteps.

I lean forward under the lamp’s faint glow. On the paper, in bold characters:

“Hongkou Pass Permit.”

It turns out...

Once more the street holds only me, the wind painted by rain, the lamp rendered thin.

### What We Should Do

— Hong Zhong

Ever since Shanghai became an isolated island, our citizens, though threatened by the invaders, have not forgotten the nation or neglected the resistance. For example, the fervor for rescue work, the enthusiasm for donating to relief funds, and the development of wartime culture all clearly demonstrate this. Yet some among us have unconsciously drifted into corrupt ways of thinking and behaving. Some still lack confidence that the resistance will prevail: they feel despair upon hearing news of a city’s fall, and elation at reports of our victories. Others adopt an “let the Communists handle it” attitude toward the war, caring not at all about saving the nation but only about their own temporary safety, forgetting the peril that threatens them personally. They are selfish and self-serving, clinging to life by any means, without a unifying faith or coherent action to aid the country.

The significance of national spiritual mobilization is profound and far-reaching: it aims to correct all irrational beliefs and habits that impede the war effort. It can be said to be the timeless principle of nation-building. Now that our resistance has entered the second phase, shifting from defense to offense, it ought to be fully embraced by the whole country.

This war is the war of a national revolution; it carries the two great purposes of revolution and reconstruction. To align ourselves with the national policy of resistance and state-building, our daily lives and spiritual endeavors must be both combative and constructive.

Every point laid out in the National Spiritual Mobilization Charter should be put into practice. We must adopt “the nation above all, the people above all, military affairs first, victory second” as our sole objective. We must reform our past life of drunken reverie, cultivate a vigorous and dynamic spirit, break down selfish, self-interested motives, and correct mixed and misguided thoughts. In our everyday lives we must put each of these into action.

Until final victory is achieved, we must continually and honestly examine ourselves; we must cleanse ourselves of past flaws during this war; our national spirit must advance with the wartime progress; we must lead serious and disciplined personal lives, uphold the principle of resisting to the end; we must align our words and deeds so that our ordinary way of life truly reflects the realities of wartime living.

In today’s campaign of national spiritual mobilization, every one of us on the isolated island must at least do the following: affirm our conviction that resistance will prevail and state-building will succeed; refuse to buy substandard goods; donate generously to relief funds; and launch anti-sabotage efforts.

Mass Weekly

### Mass Weekly to Be Published Separately

— Qin

Since Mass Weekly first appeared in this newspaper on December 5, 1938 (Republic Year 27), twenty issues have now been published.

In these twenty issues, pieces such as “National Heroes,” “Stone Boy,” “Yuan Chonghuan,” “Popular Songs,” “Wen Tianxiang,” “Hua Mulan,” “General Knowledge,” “Newspaper Literacy,” “Refugees’ Songs,” “Everyday Life Knowledge,” “Please Do Not Spit,” and others have all aroused readers’ enthusiastic sympathy. And in each issue, readers’ contributions as well as the advocacy of thrift and relief efforts, the enhancement of production work, and so on have had a tremendous impact—something of which this magazine can be proud.

However, space in the magazine is limited, and not all submitted manuscripts can be printed, often disappointing authors. Also, since this magazine is a supplement to Shenbao, there are plans to launch other weeklies. Therefore, this magazine will in future be published independently, which we believe readers and authors will welcome.

As this magazine is the people’s publication, we hope the public will continue in the same spirit as before to support it, so that it may grow even stronger. The editorial staff will follow the people’s lead, work together, and press onward!

Finally, we must express our deep gratitude to Shenbao for its resolute and enthusiastic cooperation with the Refugee Association, which has helped this magazine gain popular favor.

### Aid for Refugees (Broadcast Ballad at No. 1 Shelter on Dunxin Road)

— Fei

A thunderclap splits the blue sky;  
Half a year passes in an instant.  
Every province, every city struck by calamity,  
Pitiful cries fill the land.  
Some families are torn apart, kin scattered;  
Some flee for long, bereft of funds.  
Drifting without home or hearth,  
No one to borrow from, tears streaming.  
Rumbling tummies cannot be sated,  
Shivering bodies lack clothes,  
In every street corner they linger.  
Watching strangers become hungry ghosts,  
Their bones destined for mass graves.  
Such misery is beyond words,  
Such fate defies description.  
Thankfully, many kind souls,  
Rise without hesitation to compassion.  
They form refugee relief societies,  
Tireless, undaunted by hardship.  
Committees from every trade appeal,  
All sectors solicit donations.  
“As grains unite to form a tower,”  
“From the smallest scrap one makes a quilt.”  
Some come from associations with pledges,  
Some from funeral rites funded by provinces.  
Some save daily spending,  
Some shun alcohol and tobacco,  
Some children, full of resolve,  
Set aside their candy money each day.  
Truly, saving one life is merit,  
Better than building a pagoda atop a stupa.  
Now refugees have a place to rest,  
Thanks to your boundless blessings.  
When the household chants poems and the zither is plucked…

### The Importance of Public Health on the Isolated Island

— Yucai

Public health concerns the health of many, and is even more important than personal hygiene, for personal uncleanliness harms only the individual, but public uncleanliness harms many. Thus, while living in public spaces, we must attend to personal hygiene and also to public health—that is our responsibility. Especially on this isolated island of five million residents, public health matters more than food. Here are a few everyday ordinary things for all citizens to note. This is meant to inspire further reflection: we must each strive to be mindful at all times and places.

Do Not Spit in Public  
Spitting is a bad habit among our people; it spreads tuberculosis and causes great harm. A “No Spitting” campaign was held on March 26th by the Women’s Youth Association and other health groups. The results, though positive, are far from complete, since habits are hard to break. The fundamental remedy is to strengthen our bodies so the lungs grow robust and naturally produce less sputum.

Do Not Urinate in Public  
Urinating in public is truly indecent. In hot weather, every lane reeked of stench—highly unsanitary. If you must relieve yourself in public, always use the latrine. At the same time, we hope authorities will increase the number of public toilets—this is also a proactive measure.

Do Not Discard Fruit Peels or Rubbish in Public  
Littering fruit peels or paper scraps spoils the city’s appearance and is unsanitary. Banana peels, melon rinds, and the like are especially slippery and can attract mosquitoes, spreading disease.

Human life is fundamentally communal—our interests and well-being are intertwined. What benefits others benefits me; what harms others harms me. Therefore, anything that is beneficial to others we should pursue as we would our own benefit. This is both hygiene and public welfare.

News Reporters: News reporters are directly the providers of news for newspapers, and indirectly the megaphones for the people’s knowledge. Yet most reporters today, due to life’s pressures, occasionally become blinded by money, accept bribes from private individuals, and betray their mission. Thus their accounts of the news are often biased and cannot be recorded completely objectively. Even the more objective reports inevitably bear some slant. Only the reader’s discernment can see through it. There is another role called a “visiting correspondent,” whose duties are similar to those of a news reporter, except that they mostly gather news from the area where the newspaper is based.

News Agencies: The names of news agencies appear everywhere in newspapers. Usually at the start of each item you see the name of a certain agency—indicating that the item was issued by that agency. There are many agencies: Reuters, Agence Havas, TASS, the Associated Press, United Press, Huitong Agency, and Domei Agency. These news agencies are well‑organized; besides dispatching domestic and foreign news, they also supply intelligence directly to their governments. Naturally they are organizations representing their governments, and their tone of reporting is aimed at serving their governments’ interests. Our country’s news industry is underdeveloped and there are very few agencies. Not only is international news supplied by the major news agencies above, even domestic news is often issued on our behalf. For example, you may see “Central News Agency, [Place] [Date], Reuters wire.” This shows that Reuters’ international dispatches are translated into Chinese and then handed over to the Central News Agency for release. As a result, the supply of news is smooth but inevitably distorted or confused, misleading the facts. There is no avoiding it, and it is not a good arrangement. As for each agency’s standpoint and purpose in reporting, they differ. A single news item may have several different presentations by different agencies. Readers who do not understand the details will surely be perplexed. We will provide a detailed explanation on this point later.

Special Correspondents: A special correspondent is a reporter sent out by a newspaper on a particular assignment. For example, those dispatched to foreign locations to gather news, or those sent to report on international conferences and other major domestic and foreign events, are all special correspondents. Overseas dispatches in newspapers are the manuscripts sent by these special correspondents. Newspapers also often have what they call “exclusive telegrams” from our paper, which refer to the telegraphs sent by our own designated correspondents. Their duties are not the same as those of special correspondents.

Authorized Telegrams: When a major incident occurs in the country, newspapers often publish authorized telegrams. The issuer of an authorized telegram is either an organization or a prominent person; its significance is directly related to current affairs, so it is extremely important. Speaking of newspaper news, everyone knows there are many categories: international news, domestic news, social news, local news, economic news, cultural news, and so on. Each type of news occupies its own section in the paper, and a reader can easily find whichever category they wish. However, each category has some aspects that are difficult to understand; without explanation, full comprehension is hard to achieve.

International News: Publishing foreign reports in one’s own country’s newspaper is called international news. For example, current items such as the fall of Czechoslovakia, the peace negotiations in Spain, and the Soviet‑Japanese fisheries dispute are all international news. Today the world’s democratic countries and fascist countries hold two opposing interests and viewpoints, and socialist countries are in absolute conflict with fascist countries. The fall of Czechoslovakia and the civil war in Spain are steps in fascist aggression—Japan’s invasion of China is the same. The Soviet‑Japanese fisheries dispute, meanwhile, is one form of confrontation between socialist and fascist countries. Such descriptions follow the current controversies, but in reality the world now has only two opposing camps: (1) socialist societies; (2) capitalist societies. Fascism is merely the vanguard of capitalism attacking socialism. They were originally united. Judging by current events, fascist countries not only aim to assault socialist countries, but also to redraw boundaries among major powers, thereby creating a conflict between the front of aggression and the front of democracy. This cannot be summarized in a few sentences; we will discuss it in detail later. In short, in today’s world, whether socialist or capitalist, their struggles affect our nation and our lives. We must study international news to find our path to survival amid complex global issues. Therefore, international news is extremely important.

Domestic News: News about events occurring in our own country—whether in one province or another locality—that affect our interests is called domestic news. For instance, reports on the battles in Nanchang, fighting in Hangzhou, and various clashes between Chinese and Japanese forces across the country are all domestic news. Regardless of distance, they are all current events unfolding within China’s interior; thus they are domestic news. Some papers append a “lengthy dispatch” at the end of a news item, providing a more detailed account for readers to peruse.

Social News: The social news section covers items related to contemporary society, such as landlord‑tenant disputes, accidental fires, kidnappings and ransoms, property conflicts, rape, abuse, suicide, opium, gambling, and the like. The writing is colloquial, and the events described are all tied to present‑day society, so novice readers generally enjoy them. However, with society’s downturn, some papers sensationalize social news with material catering to low tastes—stories of monsters and demons, anecdotes about prostitutes, catching adulterers and taking them to court, etc. These are called “soft news,” meant only to entertain the leisured elite and of no benefit to ordinary laborers. Therefore, we would do well to ignore such news in the future. Instead, we should read the social news that expose injustices and call for reform, which have real meaning. From these we can glean not just factual insights but also understand the truth and the root causes.

Local News: Newspapers often have a “city news” heading, and naturally there should also be “local news.” However, in practice, some papers do not distinguish local news from domestic news; others combine it with social news; still others do not call it “local news” but label it “county reports” or “regional dispatches.” Each paper’s editing style differs, so the labels vary. In our view, despite the different names, local news remains important because it reflects the conditions of a given locality.

Economic News: No matter what paper you pick up, there is usually a special column for economic news. But this type of economic news only covers market conditions for rice, wheat, silk, tea, tung oil, sugar, and the like, as well as foreign exchange rates, premiums and discounts, bonds, and gold quotations. News on absorbing silver or stabilizing silver currency is given separate coverage. Generally speaking, this division is unreasonable, so economic news today is inseparable from business news; we will explain this to readers later. Moreover, economic news is full of technical terms that laypersons find hard to understand. Here we might as well mention a few: borrowing 100 foreign dollars and paying daily interest is called “foreign discount”; a bill payable the next day is called a “tom”; a bill payable on the same day is called a “spot”; exchanging large silver coins for small coins is called “arbitrage”; futures trading—buying now and selling later—is called “long” or “bull”; selling now and buying later is called “short” or “bear.” This column includes: (1) financial markets, subdivided into domestic and foreign exchange, gold market, silver market, securities market, etc.; (2) commodity markets, subdivided into rice market, flour market, miscellaneous grains and oil cake market, silk and tea market, cotton market, yarn and fabric market. In addition, there is the benchmark gold price, calculated in national currency. Price changes depend on the silver price: if silver rises, gold falls; if silver falls, gold rises. Securities include both government bonds and stocks; rumors or changes in the situation can cause prices to drop. Regular readers of this section are traders, but ordinary people should also pay attention at all times, because the rise and fall of money prices inevitably influence daily commodity prices. Thus economic news relates not only to our everyday lives but also to the nation’s economic lifeblood, and everyone must understand it.

Refugee Ballad

### Everyone Weighs In

— Gong Chang

Old Chen meets Old Zhang;  
Everyone weighs in:  
“On August 13th the fighting began,  
Chickens flew, dogs scrambled up the walls.”  
Your family fled, scattering like crows;  
Mine was burned, leaving only ashes.

Old Sun meets Old Tang;  
Everyone weighs in,  
Talking straight from the heart,  
Their eyes brimming with tears:  
Your son fell under the gun,  
My child perished by the bullet.

Old Li meets Old Yang;  
Everyone weighs in:  
Living in a camp for displaced people—  
Is that better than returning home?  
Your roof tiles now pave the road;  
My fields are fenced off by the mills.

Old Xu meets Old Wang;  
Everyone weighs in:  
Relying on others won’t last long—  
A man must strengthen himself.  
You have the skill to save the nation;  
I have the means to defend my home.

Old Zhou meets Old Yang;  
Once more they weigh in:  
For now, we endure a hard life,  
And then we will plan again.  
You say even stones have their day;  
I say refugees may yet find a good outcome.

### Responsibility

— Nan Jizhe

Why we must assist refugees has already been stated; how to assist refugees has already been explained; what refugees themselves ought to do has already been covered. In short, all actions must be proactive! Proactivity is different from passive charity. Passive charity is purely an obligation; proactivity becomes a responsibility. In helping refugees, we bear the responsibility of turning them into non‑refugees; as refugees, we bear the responsibility of becoming non‑refugees ourselves. Each fulfills their duty, and thus the refugee problem is completely solved!

### A Week of Combat

— Wu Guang

Guangdong

The Chinese forces in Guangdong have been exceptionally successful this week, recapturing large amounts of territory and sending successive reports of victories along every front. Victories in Guangdong and Hubei have invigorated all sides. The current situation on each front continues to unfold; the fruits of Japan’s efforts over recent months have been entirely swept away, and signs of new victories have already appeared. The situation by region is summarized below:

Guangdong Chinese troops, displaying extraordinary courage, encountered the Japanese at every turn this week and advanced with remarkable speed. In the Dongjiang area, they attacked from multiple routes towards Zengcheng, first seizing key points around the city, then charging straight in. After fierce street fighting, they fully recaptured the city. In the Beijiang area, after taking Huaxian, Chinese forces joined with other units to push on toward Guangzhou. Reports indicate they are only twelve miles from Guangzhou, and the sound of artillery can already be heard from inside the city. Their progress is noteworthy. West of the river, Chinese forces have drawn near Sanshui, and Foshan is under siege. In short, the operations in this sector have completed the encirclement of Guangzhou, and the Japanese forces trapped within are in a state of panic.

Henan

In eastern Henan, Chinese troops recently made a swift assault into Kaifeng, skirmishing with Japanese forces for days before seizing this crucial central plain stronghold. This week, buoyed by their momentum, they have pushed south toward Nanguan. The Japanese, pressed for time, relocated over two thousand reinforcements along the Longhai Railway to respond. However, these reinforcements were ambushed by Chinese forces at Zhangzhuang, resulting in brutal fighting and significant Japanese casualties. Simultaneously, another Chinese contingent took advantage of the situation to capture Tongxu County, cutting the Longhai line and severing the Japanese front from its rear. Chinese forces besieging Xinyang in southern Henan are converging on the city. Though the Japanese garrison resists tenaciously, their position is untenable.

Hubei

In northern Hubei, to defend the strongpoints of Yingshan and Anlu, Japanese forces launched several flanking counterattacks against the Chinese troops encroaching on these county seats. Chinese units blocked them at multiple points, and after days of fierce combat—even despite the Japanese use of poison gas—the attackers could not advance. At dawn on the 17th, the entire Japanese front collapsed and fled; after a vigorous pursuit, both towns are now under Chinese siege. Around Zhongxiang in central Hubei, Chinese forces have successively retaken the surrounding areas. During the week, the Japanese in the city made several sorties but were driven back each time. West of Yuekou, Japanese reinforcements advancing via the Heiliu Ferry to aid Zhongxiang were ambushed before dawn on the 17th. After two days of bloody fighting, by the evening of the 18th the Japanese forces had been annihilated.

Shanxi

In southern Shanxi, Chinese units launched a rapid large‑scale sweep against Japanese garrisons in Xiaxian and Wenxi counties, inflicting a severe blow. The Japanese attempted to send reinforcements from Anyun, but these forces were intercepted and attacked en route, and the remnants retreated the same way they had come. In Jinzhong and Yicheng, over two thousand Japanese troops launched an offensive against Chinese lines, but using maneuvers and tactical feints, Chinese forces split them into segments and defeated them one by one. The remaining Japanese withdrew into their towns, which were then captured in the ensuing pursuit. In western Shanxi, around Lishi and Zhongyang, Chinese forces have attacked vigorously all week, achieving notable successes. Japanese attempts to cross west of the river have been repelled.

### Pre-War Shanghai Municipal Construction (II)

— Linlang

(2) Libraries and Museums. These two institutions serve as spiritual nourishment for urban residents and mark the first step in cultural development. The Shanghai Municipal Government specifically constructed one library on the Right Fu South Road and one museum on the Left Fu South Road. All the buildings are extremely grand. Construction began in October of the 23rd year and was completed in January of the 25th year. Each of the library and museum measures 350 feet north–south by 550 feet east–west. Well‑maintained roads surround the entire complex. The buildings are two stories high, with a central section rising in the style of a Beijing city gate tower. Interior designs vary with purpose. Both natural and artificial lighting are abundant. Externally, the two structures present a plain and simple yet solemn appearance—harmonizing traditional Chinese style with practical needs to create a unique aesthetic. The exterior walls are faced with artificial granite, giving them a solid, refined look. The museum has virtually no windows above the ground floor. Exhibition halls rely entirely on natural light; the design ensures that visitors cannot see the light’s source, and walls receive more light than floors. Wherever paintings hang, light enters from high side windows, so that visitors standing below are not overexposed to brightness, yet the finest details of the wall displays are fully revealed. Air‑conditioning units at the foundation level keep rooms warm in winter and cool in summer, maintaining a proper temperature and fresh air. Thus, despite the lack of upper‑floor windows, visitors feel perfectly comfortable. The library contains two large reading rooms, each 32 by 86 feet. The floors are laid with cork, ensuring quiet footsteps that do not disturb others. The stacks are located at the rear of the building, isolated by fire doors, and can hold up to 500,000 volumes. The floors are made of glass bricks supported by steel frames, providing excellent illumination. Two summers ago, when the Municipal Government held its tenth‑anniversary celebrations, the literature and art exhibition and the municipal exhibition were held at the museum and library respectively.

(3) Hospital and Public Health Laboratory. In the central district on Huayuan Road a large hospital and public health laboratory occupy over eighty acres. Work began in December of the 23rd year and was finished in May of the 25th year. The initially completed hospital buildings measure 277 feet long and 53 feet wide, totaling about 12,000 square feet. The structure has four stories, with the central two stories raised to the height of a six‑story building; total volume is about 555,000 cubic feet and total floor area about 49,000 square feet. Under normal conditions it accommodates 150 beds, with capacity for an additional 50 in emergencies. The ground floor houses boilers and electrical machinery; the first floor contains administrative offices, X‑ray rooms, special consultation rooms, outpatient clinics, reception rooms, an information desk, a pharmacy, a laboratory, and emergency rooms; the second floor is for the surgical department and the men’s operating theater; the third floor houses obstetrics and gynecology and the children’s ward; the fourth floor is for staff quarters and the kitchen. All hospital facilities are remarkably complete. East of the hospital stands the public health laboratory on about fifteen acres. The three‑story building measures 134 by 49 feet, with a volume of roughly 220,000 cubic feet. The first floor includes an information desk, reception rooms, doctors’ offices, the director’s office, a library, administrative offices, a materials room, and a sterilization chamber; the second floor has vaccine and serum culture rooms; the third floor contains chemical laboratories, research rooms, an exhibition hall, and an auditorium. For practical use, the interior is equipped with gas, vacuum, compressed air, high‑frequency, direct and alternating current, high‑pressure steam, and electrically refrigerated installations.

Municipal Parks  
In the city center, the “Shanghai First Park” was the inaugural public park. Construction began in January of the 21st year, was halted for about five months by the “January 28 Incident,” and by the end of the 22nd year the main landscaping was substantially complete. Further enhancements thereafter resulted in beautiful grounds. The park lies in the western part of the central administrative area, between Guohe Road, North Guoji Road, Zhengtong Road, and Zhengtong Road, covering about 340 acres. The park divides into five areas:  
- Main Gate Area (southwest corner), the principal entrance, with grand scenery and a shallow sandpit for children’s play.  
- Flower Garden Area (west).  
- Woodland Area (center), the largest section.  
- Sports Field (east), featuring ball courts, a 400‑foot running track, and seating for 7–8,000 spectators.  
- Lake and Island Area (southeast), connected to the Qiu River, offering boating, fishing, and lotus gathering—the park’s most scenic spot.  

Initial landscaping focused on earthworks for the Sports Field, the largest task, carried out in three phases at a cost of over 23,500 labor units and moving more than 10,000 cubic feet of earth. The field was turfed, and flower beds planted around its perimeter. Horticultural works included planting over 30,000 trees and saplings, more than 60,000 flowering plants, and thousands of square meters of lawn. Besides four wooden and stone bridges, there is one stone arch, one artificial stone hill, and one artificial earth hill.

Water, Electricity, and Transportation  
(1) Tap Water. In the city center, tap water is supplied by the Zhabei Water and Power Company. The network comprises 5,400 meters of 600‑mm diameter mains and 27,860 meters of 100‑mm diameter pipes as laid out by the Public Utilities Bureau. The first phase, about 25 kilometers, is complete. Remaining sections can be installed on demand; any user guaranteed by the Municipal Government may extend mains without paying extension fees. Thus, city‑center residents benefit more from tap water than those in other Shanghai districts.  

(2) Electricity and Street Lighting. Initially, electricity came via a 6,600‑volt line along Gongnong Road, connecting northwards to the Zhabei Water and Power Company’s Jiansongqiao Plant and southwards to its Pingliang Road substation (which receives power from the Shanghai Power Company). Therefore, the city center is doubly supplied, eliminating fears of prolonged outages. By the summer of the 26th year, about 8 kilometers of high‑voltage lines and 13 kilometers of low‑voltage lines in the first phase had been installed, and streetlights erected wherever lines ran. Streets are fully lit at night, ensuring safe travel.  

(3) Telephone. The city center’s telephone service was initially routed from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau’s Zhabei branch to the Jiangwan branch, then along Tiyuhui Road, Xiangyin Road, Songhu Road, and Sanmin Road on fifty-pair cables into the district. Twenty-five pairs went to the Municipal Government’s exchange for external trunk lines; the remaining twenty-five served other local users, connecting via the Jiangwan exchange to the Zhabei branch. By the 26th year, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau had established area exchanges with 400 automated lines linked to the Zhabei branch, forming a comprehensive network.  

(4) Public Buses. The primary transport in the city center is public buses operated by the Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company. Services began in spring of the 23rd year. By the 26th year, Routes 4, 5, and 6 ran between the center, North Station, Leping Road, and the Zhabei Water and Power Plant. Route 4 (Zhabei Beijing–Shanghai Station to the city center) is about 10.5 kilometers long; a round trip takes about thirty minutes, including seven minutes of stops, at an average speed of 27 km/h. Twelve buses provide a departure every five minutes. For shorter trips, well‑equipped rickshaws are available.  

Qiujiang Wharf  
For decades, wharves and warehouses have lined both banks of the Huangpu River for mooring and cargo handling. However, the river’s narrow, shallow waters, despite dredging, still hinder deep‑draft vessels, and loading/unloading remains difficult. Since launching its “Prosperous Shanghai Plan,” the Municipal Government has focused on port development and modern wharves. On the plan’s adoption day in the 23rd year, the Central Bank decided to invest in Qiujiang Wharf and its warehouses. On September 4th they formed the Qiujiang Wharf Design Committee. In August of the following year, with designs completed, the committee became the Construction Committee and building began. Groundbreaking was on June 20th of the 25th year. The project had three phases; the first phase was completed in summer of the 26th year and officially opened on June 12th. Thus the Qiujiang Wharf, unrivaled in the Far East, was revealed to the world. The first vessel to berth was the state‑owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Fairness; soon after, the Nippon Queen, one of the largest Far East liners, made its inaugural stop on the 13th. Sadly, after the August 13th incident, this much‑anticipated wharf suffered bombing damage, becoming a battlefield—tragic indeed! The following records its construction process and warehouse details:

(1) Location and Works. Qiujiang Wharf lies on the west bank of the Huangpu River at No. 90 Shangzi, north of the Qiu River mouth. Approximately 800 acres of shoal and 300 acres of adjacent land were acquired and raised to 19.5 feet above Wusong datum, yielding a shoreline about 3,000 feet long by 1,000 feet wide for wharf and stacking facilities. Work proceeded in three phases. The first phase built two 590‑foot wharves; two two‑story reinforced‑concrete warehouses; and two iron‑roofed flat warehouses, at a cost of 5 million yuan. These occupy the southern third of the site. Plans call for a straight wharf 3,000 feet long, eight four‑story steel‑frame warehouses, three iron‑roofed flat warehouses, and a southern barge port. About 1,000 feet inland runs Pu West Road, the north–south artery, and Wuqian Road, the east–west artery connecting to the city center. A public wharf of 350 feet lies at the north end of the district. Hoisting cranes and light‑rail tracks on the wharf decks in front of each warehouse handle cargo. Land alongside Pu West Road is reserved for travel agencies, shipping companies, freight forwarders, motor transport firms, hotels, and related agencies.

(2) Combined Rail, Water, and Air Transport. As Shanghai is the major hub for Yangtze River cargo distribution, the wharf plan includes rail lines before and after the warehouses connecting to the Songhu railway, linking to all trunk routes (Beijing‑Zhejiang, Pingjin, Guangdong, etc.) for intermodal transport. Imports can be unloaded to trains for inland delivery; exports loaded from trains directly onto ships for overseas shipment without intermediate stacking, saving time and costs. These tracks span about nine kilometers, estimated to cost 750,000 yuan. Thousands of acres around the wharf are designated for an airport, with a separate seaplane anchorage on the river, enabling water‑land‑air intermodal freight transport.

(3) The Wharves. The two 590‑foot wharves completed in the first phase each have 50‑foot‑wide decks equipped with mooring piles and cross piles for barges. Decks house rotating cranes; lower decks allow small boats to operate at low tide. Whereas other Shanghai wharves can only host vessels with up to 30‑foot draft, Qiujiang Wharf’s straight shoreline, wide river front, and deep water accommodate vessels with up to 33‑foot draft—no tide waiting, no danger, even the Queen Mary can dock here safely.

(4) Warehouses. The two first‑phase reinforced‑concrete warehouses measure 220 by 130 feet; upper floors for long‑term storage, lower floors for short‑term storage. The iron‑roofed flat warehouses, each 220 by 80 feet with three bridges to the wharf deck, serve as temporary short‑term storage. Total capacity is about 15,000 tons. Hoisting cranes on the decks lift cargo directly from ship holds to any warehouse floor. Inspection cranes in front of the lower floors lift goods to upper floors. Rear freight elevators enable one‑way internal flow.

(5) Transportation. The city center’s public road network designates two main arteries: Pu West Road (north–south) from Yangshupu along the Huangpu west bank parallel to Gongnong Road, ending at Wusong; and Wuqian Road (east–west) from the northern edge of the first wharf area across Gongnong Road to the city center. These roads, costing 150,000 yuan, were built jointly by the Central Bank and Municipal Government. Upon opening, three bus routes served the wharf: 1) Wuqian Road to Gongnong Road to Yangshupu Road; 2) Wuqian Road through the city center to Qimei Road in the International Settlement; 3) Wuqian Road through the city center to Jiangwan Road to North Sichuan Road. Bus trips take no more than twenty minutes.

(6) Other Buildings. First‑phase construction also includes an office building between the warehouses; staff dormitories for forty people; and a 257,400‑square‑foot open cargo yard.

(B) Other Construction  
Shanghai’s construction proceeded in two parts: new works in the city center district and the renovation or expansion of existing facilities in Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts. Section A above covered the large, meticulously planned new projects that founded the New City. The following summarizes the reorganization and expansion in the older districts over the ten years from the 17th to the 26th year. Projects are listed without further classification into civil works and utilities. City‑center projects are omitted here.

City Divisions  
To promote balanced municipal development, the Shanghai Municipal Government, after studying various needs and field conditions, divided Shanghai into the following districts:  
(1) Administrative District: the central portion of the city center district.  
(2) Industrial District: both banks of Wusong and Unzao Bays; south of Guohuo Road in Nanshi; Zhabei along Liuying River and Hengbang River; and the Pudong area from Qingning Temple south to Yangsigang Bay.  
(3) Residential and Commercial District: within Shanghai South City Temple; south of Yuyuan Road in the west; north of Qiaoqiao Road; west of Haige Road; and east of Kaixuan Road.  
(4) Oil Depot District: Gaoqiao and Sha areas.  
(5) Timber Industry Area: from the southern end of the North Piao Coal Mine Company along the river to Jiangshan Road.

Roads and Drains  
(1) South Shanghai District: most streets were unpaved. Over the past ten years, the Municipal Works Bureau has successively opened and improved main roads. Eastmen Road, Heping Road, and Liming Road from Eastmen Road to Damaitou Street now have drain pipes and asphalt paving. Other roads with drains include Lujiahong Road, Xietu Road, Zhizaoju Road, Dapu Road, and Luban Road.  
(2) Zhabei District: roads here were also mostly unpaved. Asphalt resurfacing and water‑pipe installation were carried out on Datong Road, Gonghe Road, Hengfeng Road, and the southern section of Baoshan Road. After the January 28 Incident, the district’s roads were almost entirely destroyed. The Works Bureau rebuilt all routes according to plan and resurfaced the northern section of Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, Baoxing Road, Baochang Road, Hongxing Road, and Baoyuan Road with asphalt. Utility lines were upgraded and paved. Streets in Jiangwan and Wusong were also overhauled.  
(3) Pudong District: Pudong Avenue was opened and Chunshan Street and others were reorganized. Over ten years, 84,171 meters of asphalt roads, 3,915 meters of small‑block stone paving, 5,098 meters of gravel roads, 213,125 meters of unpaved roads, and 222,071 meters of coal‑scoria roads were laid. Drains totaling 189,508 meters were installed.

Bridges and Wharves  
(1) Bridges: Shanghai’s urban waterways are led by the Huangpu River, followed by the Wusong River and Unzao Bay. To enhance cross‑river traffic, 258 bridges were built over ten years at a cost of over 938,000 yuan. Major bridges include Hengfeng Bridge, Wuzhen Bridge, Caojiadu Bridge, No. 3 Zhongshan Road Bridge over the Wusong River, and Unzao Bay Bridge.  
(2) Wharves and Quays: construction of wharves and quays along the Huangpu and Wusong Rivers has been a key project. Over ten years, ninety‑four wharves were built at a cost exceeding 320,000 yuan. New quays totaling 3,771 meters cost about 279,000 yuan.

Municipal Buildings  
(1) Administrative offices: the city government and various bureau office buildings in the city center district. (See Section A, “Construction in the City Center District.”)  
(2) Cultural and educational facilities: sports grounds, gymnasiums, swimming pools, libraries, museums, the zoo, the botanical garden, and newly built schoolhouses.  
(3) Public health and public facilities: the municipal hospital, South Shanghai municipal hospital, Public Health Testing Institute, North Shanghai District health office, municipal infectious disease hospital, municipal first cemetery, various vegetable markets, Wusong Park, First Park, and Wenmiao Park.  
(4) Welfare for the common people: three commoner residences on Quanjiaan Road, Xietu Road, Jiaotong Road, etc., and four commoner villages on Zhongshan Road, Qimei Road, Pushan Road, and Taipingqiao Road, totaling 1,848 rooms. Over the past ten years, newly constructed municipal buildings cost a total of 4,999,148 yuan and 6 jiao 8 fen.

Spring and Autumn

### Encouraging “Marriage and Childbirth”

— Liufeng

Aggressors (whether German, Japanese, or Italian) not only lack raw materials but also lack people. Although they constantly claim, “Our population is too large! Our small countries cannot hold so many people, so we have no choice but to expand abroad!”—such statements are merely a fine excuse for seizing foreign lands! Anyone who believes this is truly the biggest fool in the world.

I say aggressors are short of people because they always encourage their own citizens to marry and have children. In Germany, a married man supposedly finds it very easy to get a job. In Italy, giving birth to two children earns rewards; if one has three, four, or five, I imagine the Prime Minister will deliver yet another startling speech to the masses, and “special rewards” go without saying.

Now I hear that in Japan the director of the so‑called “Life Affairs Division” of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Takashima, has proclaimed: his goal is “six children per household in Japan.” He further states that “an agency for encouraging childbirth and for national population control will soon be established, and among the many ‘rear‑echelon plans’ proposed for national welfare in this critical period, increasing the Japanese population is the most important.” Therefore, “it is proposed that Japan follow the German and Italian example in giving state subsidies to encourage marriage and childbirth.”

These three aggressive countries are not only united in ideology but also seem to feel the need to “standardize” marriage and childbirth. But, to the sorrow of our “ally,” aren’t there already far too many of those “marrying and childbirth” men driven to the “continent” to engage in “heroic deeds”? These “warriors” not only waste their bullets but also, when seeing Chinese “flower girls,” waste much of their spirit. At least while they live that’s something—but once they turn into “ashes,” marriage and childbirth are out of the question! This is a grave concern for the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which points out “a conspicuous cause of the low birthrate is that since the war began in 1937, Japan has lost 500,000 men in battle.” Although this figure from the ministry is not entirely reliable, 500,000 is no small number. If these 500,000 able-bodied men could be “produced” en masse like weapons in an arms factory, the results would surely be considerable, right?

Second, aiming for “six children per household” as Life Affairs Division Director Takashima’s “goal” is also quite difficult. Given the rising cost of living in Japan today, the real incomes of both salaried and working classes have fallen drastically since the incident (i.e., the war). Though the state economy is very tight and subsidies to encourage marriage and childbirth have been proposed, supporting “six children” is a huge burden. Moreover, in current Japan parents must even pay several dozen yen of national debt per infant. Who would willingly increase their burden—and that of their children—by having more offspring?

As for so‑called “bride schools” (a bride being a new wife), even if they offer some kind of “crash course,” children must still spend ten months in the womb—that is a very long “time”! And raising a child to sixteen or seventeen to become a young soldier takes even longer!

“A state subsidy to encourage marriage and childbirth along the lines of Germany and Italy” can do nothing now—it will take sixteen or seventeen years to have an effect. How is that any good?

### A Sketch of General Zhao Tong
— Zhou Yizhi

The young General Zhao Tong abandoned civil engineering to lead a guerrilla detachment and resist the Japanese forces. As a result, his enemies placed a 100,000‑yuan bounty on his head, yet he continued to carry it with him through every perilous mission.

Like an elusive shadow, General Zhao, a youthful leader of the Chinese guerrillas who constantly plagued the Japanese around the suburbs of Beiping, deftly evaded their searches and slipped out of North China. At the end of last year, this courageous young man appeared in Chongqing, the wartime capital of China, to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang and other military and political leaders, to report on guerrilla activities, and to seek their guidance.

General Zhao is only twenty‑seven this year, of modest height and build, and gives the impression of a gentle, diligent university student. Today, he commands tens of thousands of brave men operating in the western hills beyond Pingxi. The Chinese people hold him in high esteem; by contrast, his enemies greatly fear him.

One morning last October, he bade farewell to his brothers and traveled from Beiping to Chongqing. Disguised as a cabbage peddler, he passed through the city gates under the watchful eyes of Japanese military police, who searched him and then let him go. Had they recognized him as Zhao Tong, they surely would have celebrated, for his head was worth 100,000 yuan!

General Zhao’s men often slipped into the city aboard Japanese military trucks driven by Chinese drivers. He, however, chose a different path. Because Japanese spies were everywhere in the city, keeping close watch on this key figure, he once sought treatment for his nose at Union Hospital inside the city. There, under an assumed name, he slept in a comfortable bed for several months, and then recuperated there for another two weeks. Each day, an attractive nurse would come to his bedside to inform him of the guerrillas’ movements in the Western Hills. Little did she realize that he was their true commander.

When he was discharged for the fourth time, he donned a gleaming silk robe and, from a careful distance, resembled a theatrical performer. Thanks to this clever disguise, he safely reached Tianjin, from where he boarded a steamer to Shanghai, and shortly thereafter arrived in Hong Kong. Upon his arrival, his agent in Beiping sent word that, not long after he left the city, the Japanese had received intelligence on his whereabouts in Beiping. They searched the entire city and, within two or three days, arrested and interrogated many young Chinese men in hopes of discovering him among them.

As for the value of his head, in 1933 it was only worth 3,000 yuan, when he and a few comrades first organized the “Northeast Youth Iron‑Blood Army” in Manchuria. He had been a second‑year student at Northeastern University, studying civil engineering and planning a career in that field after graduation. Now his agent, Mr. Pan Junxi (phonetic), still leads some five thousand of his old troops in ambushes against the Japanese in the southern mountain regions of the Liaodong Peninsula, keeping the enemy constantly on the defensive.

In April 1936, Zhao Tong left Manchuria for Beiping. At that time, the Japanese were pressuring the Chinese authorities in North China to “self‑govern” and break away from the Central Government. He and his comrades foresaw that this would lead to conflict, so they began studying the terrain around Beiping, especially mapping out the rifles hidden among the villages, identifying key military positions, and gauging public sentiment.

### Impressions of “Ride A Crooked Mile”
— Bai Hua

In “The New Water Margin,” Yakintay Milov’s portrayal of a straightforward, magnanimous pirate drew considerable attention. His style was reminiscent of Wallace Beery’s. Unsurprisingly, after the sensational success of “The New Water Margin,” he now stars solo in “Ride A Crooked Mile.”

How fitting then that in “Ride A Crooked Mile” he plays the Cossack leader McBarren, a character ideally suited to his manner! Crude yet generous, McBarren has no recollection of having married a Russian woman (Manri) twenty years ago, nor of having a twenty‑year‑old son. Yet when he learns that his son is likewise “brave, spirited,” and very much his father’s son, his paternal instincts are stirred, prompting him to “turn over a new leaf” (he is a cattle rustler who has settled in America). What a lovely character! But just as he prepares to take his son—originally named Meng Gaomao but now called John, since he disliked his given name—on a world tour, the authorities uncover evidence of his cattle thefts and he is imprisoned. John joins the U.S. Cavalry to assist his father’s escape, thinking it a sound strategy, but once the plan is under way he feels that a soldier’s duty is “to serve one’s country loyally,” and that “loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fully realized.” This story is truly moving. I introduce it because it reminds me so much of Beery’s “Companions of the Soil” and “Son of a Bandit,” and personally I have a great fondness for such films.

Moreover, on a higher plane, nowadays we should encourage those sons who denounce their criminal fathers, like “the sheep‑thief’s son who reports his father.”

As for the staging of “Ride A Crooked Mile,” the director crafted Milov’s character with exceptional care, especially in the first half. Scenes like: at the cattle ranch, his men inform him that a woman wishes to see him; the meeting with his wife; the encounter with his son; the father‑son sparring; the trial of the horses—through these many scenes, McBarren’s character is developed with remarkable precision and a great sense of humor. Take the horse‑testing scene: (1) the father vaults onto a horse; (2) as if unskilled, the son lies low on the horse’s back; (3) McBarren spurs his mount off at speed, showing his riding skills; (4) seeing his father disappear in the distance, the son leaps down, leaps onto another fierce horse, catches up, and displays all kinds of equestrian tricks. Not only is it entertaining, but the son’s character also emerges clearly.

The introduction of the Russian woman, Trina, also reveals the director’s cleverness. Having first depicted the horseriding trial, the director repeats her singing voice while the father and son rest, thus orchestrating the meeting between John and Trina. Later, at the banquet, when Trina stands to sing, John immediately joins in with a stirring Cossack song—the transition is tight and cohesive. In the second half, because the narrative alternates between McBarren’s imprisonment and John’s service in the U.S. Cavalry, it inevitably slackens a bit. But the scene in the cellar where McBarren escapes prison and John is sent to capture him remains strong. When McBarren finally says, “Now we’re enemies!” and knocks his son unconscious with a punch before fleeing, the natural flow of father and son’s natures is still deeply moving.

“Ride A Crooked Mile” may be a supporting feature, but compared with last issue’s “The Black Umbrella Bandit” or other frivolous song‑and‑dance pieces, it is by no means unworthy.

Chapter Eight: Illusion or Reality—Life Is a Stage; Knowing When to Advance and When to Halt, Everywhere Is Home

Mrs. Suliya, upon hearing this, immediately agreed to donate ten transport trucks for use in China as quickly as possible. On another occasion, a female friend of hers in Northwest China—possibly associated with the Eighth Route Army—reported a shortage of medical supplies, and she personally donated $10,000 worth of medicines. She has made many such donations. Now she has proclaimed a grand vow: “Any profits earned in China shall benefit China. I do not wish to extract Chinese money and take it back to America, for I already have ample wealth, and so does America.” Jin Danyun heard her say this in person, and Mrs. Suliya spoke highly of Jin Danyun, even inviting him to serve as her consultant. On this trip to China, her investments hinged on two ventures, both inspired by her previous donations. One was the establishment of an automobile manufacturing plant; the other, the founding of a pharmaceutical company. Reflecting on the prewar era, when China could not build its own cars and had to import every vehicle—imports that numbered a truly significant amount each year—Mrs. Suliya realized that as roads multiplied, so did the need for vehicles, yet domestic production was nonexistent. Building more highways simply meant more sales for foreign manufacturers. Even wartime needs for trucks to transport the wounded were met with shortages. After the war, several Chinese automobile companies sprang up. This new auto plant was set up by Mrs. Suliya in partnership with several Chinese friends, with total capital of ten million yuan, half of which Mrs. Suliya provided. In the past, foreign‑run businesses in China were often labeled by nationality—American firms as “American Commercial” or British as “British Commercial”—but such designations are now obsolete. Except for a few industries that the state must manage as national enterprises, all private and civilian businesses, regardless of the proprietor’s nationality or capital, are free to operate under Chinese protection, making national labels unnecessary. Mrs. Suliya’s automobile plant focuses exclusively on producing new‑model public vehicles, not private carriages for leisurely personal use. In recent years, as cars have found ever‑wider applications, almost every field requires motor vehicles. (94)

### Anglo‑Prussian Marriage

(From the April issue of the 11th year of Tongzhi of Late Qing)

Britain and Prussia are indeed nations united by marriage. The Prussian Crown Prince married the eldest princess of the current King of England more than ten years ago. Their harmony is as perfect as lacquer and glue. During the Franco‑Prussian War, wounded soldiers from the battlefields were admitted to the Military Medical Bureau for treatment, where the Crown Princess personally visited them and even prescribed decoctions and medicines. The soldiers, moved by gratitude, pledged their loyalty without hesitation, willing to sacrifice themselves. The kingdom extolled her as the Wise Princess, celebrating the Crown Prince’s good fortune in having such a capable consort. Now, Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia, has come of age—her beauty rivals jade and her countenance outshines snow. The King of England plans to marry her to his second prince, the same young prince who once toured Hong Kong and Shanghai. Recently, the King himself visited Berlin, the Prussian capital, likely for this purpose. This truly cements the friendship of the two nations and promises a century of harmony.

### Students of the Western Studies Institute Pay Courtesy Call on the American Consul

The students of the Western Studies Institute are scheduled to depart for the United States on the eighth of this month. Early the day before, they all went to the American consulate to pay their respects to the consul. Over forty sedan chairs from the institute halted outside the consulate. The students alighted and, accompanied by escorting officials including Justice Ministry Director Chen Lanbin, filed in single file, wearing dignified hats and footwear. They dressed in black gauze‑collared robes with open fronts, belts with hooks at their waists, straw hats and pointed boots, pouches and fans at their sides—fresh, neat, and impressive, clearly future talents in administration and strategy. Once inside the hall, they stood in rows, two abreast, presenting an orderly scene like egret lines or phoenix ranks. The American consul, his countenance bright, received them with warm words of encouragement. In essence, he said: “You students, born and raised in China, are traveling far overseas to master the ways of Westerners. This unprecedented undertaking also attests to the Qing Emperor’s dedicated governance reforms, opening a new chapter in a thousand years of history…” The students sat in a circle, listening with joyful expressions. When he finished speaking, they bowed and withdrew. They then proceeded to the circuit intendant’s office to pay their respects; the circuit intendant’s exhortations of encouragement were much the same as those of the American consul.
