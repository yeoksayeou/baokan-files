Du Ping's Commentary

### The Current Situation in the Mediterranean

Although British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier have jointly issued a declaration resolving to use force to guarantee the independence of Greece and Romania, Italy has not shown any restraint and is planning to divide the territories of Greece, Romania, and Bulgaria, attempting to establish a Macedonian regime and further seize the interests of Britain and France in the Mediterranean.

The Mediterranean is an inland sea surrounded by the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a vital transportation route between Britain and its colonies in India, East Africa, Australia, and the Far East. To ensure the safety of this route, Britain has not only built a large naval base on Malta and stationed a strong fleet, but also controls the eastern and western gateways of the Mediterranean: the Strait of Gibraltar and Port Said, the exit of the Suez Canal. Therefore, Gibraltar, Malta, and Port Said have become Britain's military strongholds in the Mediterranean. Not only that, but it also occupies an absolute advantage in the eastern Mediterranean: Greece is politically close to it, and Cyprus, south of Turkey, is its colony. Extending further, its influence can extend eastward through Palestine and into various parts of the Near East, such as Iraq, Persia, and Arabia on the Red Sea. In recent years, to strengthen its power in this area, it has been building strong naval and air force bases in Cyprus, Port Said, and Alexandria at the mouth of the Nile.

France is also an important country in the Mediterranean. The western Mediterranean is its only transportation route between the mainland and its North African colonies. Toulon, Corsica, and Bizerte are its military bases, and it has also made considerable efforts in its operations there.

Italy stretches across the Mediterranean like a "boot." It has a network of military bases in the central Mediterranean. After the European War, it made every effort to expand its influence in the Adriatic Sea to enhance its basis for development in the eastern and western Mediterranean. Its war against Abyssinia was the beginning of its expansion of power in the Mediterranean. After annexing Abyssinia, it actively fortified Pantelleria, located between Sicily and French Tunisia, with the aim of using it as a base for submarines and aircraft to cut off Mediterranean traffic when necessary. At the same time, it strengthened its military deployments in Libya and completed the Tobruk naval port. In this way, it can connect with the Dodecanese Islands to the northeast and consolidate the connection between Sicily and Pantelleria to the west, effectively controlling the central Mediterranean and the sea route from Malta to the Suez Canal. As a result, the communication between the French mainland and its North African colonies, as well as British influence in the eastern Mediterranean, have been threatened. Not only that, but it also colluded with Germany to launch the Spanish Civil War. After Franco's victory, it concluded a military alliance with him, stipulating that Germany and Italy would provide funds to carve out 80 square kilometers of land in the Pyrenees Mountains to establish naval and air force bases for use by Germany and Italy. More recently, it annexed Albania, dominated the Adriatic Sea, and coveted the various islands of Greece. Its influence is rapidly developing in the eastern Mediterranean.

The rapid expansion of Italy's power is, frankly speaking, caused by Britain's policy of appeasement. Because Britain in the past did not support a system of collective security and wanted to seek security for its interests in the Mediterranean through appeasement. But the result of appeasement not only failed to stop the aggression but made the actions of the aggressors even more radical. Now, even its own interests in the Mediterranean are seriously threatened. After many setbacks, Britain has gradually awakened. This can be demonstrated by its joint declaration with France, resolving to use force to guarantee the independence of Greece and Romania and to maintain their interests in the Mediterranean. But in a situation where for every foot the righteous advance, the wicked advance ten, relying solely on diplomatic declarations without practical action is still insufficient to stop the aggression of the aggressors. Now, Italy is dreaming of the glory of the ancient Roman Empire, attempting to establish a Macedonian regime with the Mediterranean as its lake; and in the western Mediterranean, Hitler is remotely echoing this, relying on the rights conferred by his military alliance with Franco, he will send a part of the fleet into Spanish territorial waters to threaten Gibraltar. Let us see how Britain and France will maintain their interests in the Mediterranean!

### A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Xi'an Amidst the Sound of Japanese Bombing; Many Buildings in the City Destroyed; All Businesses Change to Trading at Night; Japanese Aircraft Scatter Terrorist Leaflets; Causing Deep Resentment Among the People

(Xi'an) - After leaving Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, for four weeks, this reporter has returned and sees that the appearance of the entire city is no longer what it was before. This reporter first visited Xi'an in early March when the city had not yet been affected by the war. The streets were crowded with people, and the shops were well-stocked with goods, with prices much lower than in Chongqing. This time, upon arrival, the reporter went to the Xi'an Guest House established by the China Travel Service, intending to book a room. The manager kindly replied, "I am very sorry, but after Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and destroyed the kitchen three days ago, we no longer offer Western food." This was the first sign of the war that this reporter encountered. Less than five minutes after returning, the familiar air raid siren sounded again, and the residents rushed towards the city walls. Shortly afterward, an emergency siren sounded loudly. Within a few minutes, two formations of Japanese bombers flying at a high altitude dropped bombs over the heart of the city. They exploded on the ground with a deafening sound. Afterward, from the burning buildings, two plumes of thick smoke rose. After the air raid, this reporter inspected the commercial area that had been bombed. What was destroyed in the buildings and shops since the previous visit made this reporter shudder. The walls of the destroyed houses and shops were spotted with shrapnel, which was everywhere. The preaching hall of the British Baptist Church was destroyed by a light bomb in this air raid. Fortunately, Bishop Douen was not in the church at the time. The next day, the house of a Chinese pastor was bombed and completely destroyed. In this air raid, the houses of the National League of Nations epidemic prevention team stationed in Xi'an were also hit by bombs, causing this disaster. On the surface, it makes a deep impression, but in reality, the destruction of the entire city must be far more than one-tenth of the total industry. The day after this reporter returned, there were 17 Japanese aircraft in the air raid, 16 of which dropped bombs, and the other scattered leaflets claiming that "China will become Bolshevistic." The leaflets were printed with crude cartoons depicting a weak Chinese person under the control of the cruel Stalin. The leaflets also urged the Chinese people to turn to their "only true friend," Japan. However, the people were unmoved by it. Their homes and livelihoods had been destroyed by bombs just minutes before, and the sadness and anger in their hearts can be imagined. How could words move them? Public morale does not seem to be affected by these air raids, because the residents are accustomed to air raids, and although they respect and stay away from them, they never feel pain because of them. At night, when everyone believes there is no danger of air raids, the whole city resumes activity. Shops open for business, the streets are crowded with people, and the restaurants are full of customers. According to the views of a certain Chinese official whom this reporter met, Japanese air raids are not so much to destroy special military targets as to be part of a general policy of terrorism. Some Chinese leaflets are distributed to Chinese people in the occupied areas, printed by lithography, with a map of China, in which all important cities are hanging Japanese flags. Other major cities, such as Chongqing, Guiyang, and Kunming, have a large bomb dropped on them, and the Chinese residents below are surrounded by smoke. A certain high-ranking Chinese military officer told this reporter that Japanese air raids on undefended cities in China have caused the people to feel deep resentment towards any actions of the Japanese army in China and are of great benefit in inspiring support for the government's resistance against Japan in the more remote provinces. Even the uneducated can understand the meaning of the bombs dropped on their hometowns. This reporter once passed through a small village in Shanxi. A Chinese person whose patriotism was superior to his knowledge of English posted English translations of Chinese slogans everywhere on the walls, stating that Japanese air raids on undefended cities are the most brutal act of mankind, and that the entire Chinese nation is fighting for the freedom, equality, and independence of its country with its own blood. The grammar may have minor flaws, but the emotions are clear. The residents of Xi'an are now busy rebuilding the bombed houses, and most of them are building with bricks instead of wooden structures. Those whose glass windows have not been shattered are protected by brick walls, with only the doors open. Xi'an now works at night. Because of the fear of air raids, all industries are trading behind closed doors, and no lights are allowed outside. Therefore, shop owners can only post notices outside the door or send people to guide customers so that they know where to go. At the same time, various official activities are now scattered in various places so that in case of an air raid, the "nerve center" of the province will not be shut down for two or three hours. The British Baptist Hospital, which was hit by two bombs on March 7, is now operating in two parts. All patients have been moved outside the city, and foreign doctors take turns on duty in the city hospital because all the equipment of the hospital cannot be moved. Although only two people were killed in the air raid on the 7th, the equipment in the hospital was greatly damaged. One of the two operating rooms, the pathology laboratory, and the X-ray room were completely destroyed, and even the microscopes were almost destroyed. According to a certain doctor, a new X-ray bulb that the hospital had been waiting for for several months had just been transported and installed. The next day, it was attacked. After the rescue work began, it was discovered that this X-ray bulb was completely intact in the rubble of the X-ray room, but the X-ray machine had been shattered. Before, there was a machine without a bulb, and now there is a bulb without a machine. (Dispatch from Reuters Special Correspondent, 13th)

### Chiang Ting-wen Talks About How Japan Has Failed to Invade Xi'an, Is Now Devoting Itself to Political Education, and Has a Good Relationship With the Communist Party

(Chongqing) Chiang Ting-wen, Chairman of Shaanxi Province and Commander of the Tenth War Zone, told a Reuters reporter today, "I do not believe that the Japanese army intends or is able to cross the Yellow River and invade Xi'an in the near future. If the Japanese army wants to continue to advance westward in North China, its strategy will be to advance from Hankou, passing through Xiangyang. However, this route is mountainous, and the Japanese army must fight through mountains and ridges, and at the cost of outweighing the gains, capture Xi'an. We have been preparing fortifications for several months, and the Chinese army has deployed defenses layer by layer. The Japanese army cannot fly over. A foreign military expert recently visited our defense area and said to me upon his return, 'If the Japanese want to seize Xi'an, they are incredibly foolish.' Since the war has not yet extended to Shaanxi Province, the commander of Shaanxi Province often sends troops to other places to assist in the war. Shaanxi Province has sent 250,000 new recruits. We are now devoting ourselves to political education and economic development. We are currently adopting the Baojia system as a medium for conscription and promoting political education." Commander Chiang Ting-wen continued to talk about economic development, saying that this year's wheat harvest is expected to be extremely abundant, and cotton production is also considerable. It is a pity that there are not many yarn factories, so the authorities are now encouraging the use of handlooms. The prevalence of the cooperative movement in Shaanxi Province is a feature of economic development. The provincial government has issued loans of 6 million yuan to expand industrial cooperation, and local banks have also allocated 4 million yuan for their expenses. In addition, the central government has supplemented loans for textiles, soaps, and munitions, etc. Production is now increasing day by day, and transportation is also rapidly improving. In the past twelve months, 3,000 kilometers of new roads have been built, and the new railway will be completed in eight months. The required rails are taken from the Longhai Railway east of Zhengzhou. The Chinese army has demolished the Longhai Road for strategic reasons. The relationship between the National Army and the Communist Party is quite good. When asked about the special area of the Communist Party in northern Shaanxi, Commander Chiang Ting-wen replied, "Ten years of discord cannot be eliminated overnight. However, the current situation is indeed satisfactory. In the eyes of the central government, the so-called Communist Party Special Area does not exist. We believe that the current environment allows the Communist Party to exist, but we hope to make the Communist Party understand that communism cannot be applied to China. We hope that it will change its policies, but if it does not change, we have nothing to fear." (Reuters Telegraph of the 13th)

### The Problem of Amendment of the American Neutrality Act; Pittman Advocates Enacting New Laws on the Sino-Japanese Problem; Undersecretary of State Welles Speaks, Advocating American Aid to Invaded Countries

(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated today at the committee's discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment that he would very much like to "enact new laws" outside the Neutrality Act for the Sino-Japanese problem "in order to prevent Japan's aggression in China and Japan's discrimination against American interests." Pittman praised China's "arduous, unyielding, and historically rare spirit of hard struggle," and recognized that the current American Neutrality Act does indeed have biases and injustices in its treatment of China and Japan. However, it is difficult to legislate to be fair everywhere, so he advocated enacting new laws for the Far East in order to restore justice. According to Pittman's views, it can represent the diplomatic policy of the American government, so his attitude is very noteworthy. (American Associated Press Telegraph of the 14th)

(Washington) Senator Pittman, the Democratic Senator who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that he agreed with the view that Japan's policies were destroying the Nine-Power Treaty. The signatories to the treaty all guaranteed to respect China's territorial integrity. At a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee studying the Neutrality Act, Mrs. Wright, a spokesperson for ten women's groups, said that the United States possessed "terrible power," and that strict neutrality restrictions had relaxed and that the restrictions had silently colluded with the aggressor. Pittman then said that the United States could take economic measures to force Japan to end "the destruction of American rights in China." He had a clear idea of these means.

Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Today is the 196th anniversary of the birth of the late President Jefferson. It is also the 120th anniversary of the founding of the University of Virginia (founded by the late President Jefferson). The school authorities held a celebration. Undersecretary of State Welles also came to participate and gave an important speech, pointing out the crises that the current neutrality law could cause, and advocated amending it so that all countries suffering from aggression could benefit from it. He said, "If the late President Jefferson were alive, he would also see that certain national leaders are unwilling to resolve international disputes in a fair and peaceful manner, but instead want to drive millions of lives into a vortex of a world war. The horror of this war is far from comparable to the wars of the Napoleonic era. The leader of a certain great nation (referring to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini) made a statement a few days ago, saying that to maintain culture, there must be war. How can this view be accepted by the nations of the world? What is expected from the situation is that certain nations are following the orders of a few people, stepping forward to an abyss of uncertainty, and will not stop until they are completely wiped out, which is puzzling. At this time, world peace is completely indivisible. If any country uses aggression against a peace-loving nation, even if it conquers it, our country's geographical distance from it is the same, and the impact it feels is the same. In essence, if the world order is disrupted, and human principles and international relations regulations are destroyed, our country's interests will also be harmed as a result. As far as convening international conferences is concerned, all participating countries must have the sincerity to maintain peace, and there is reason to believe that all the constraints accepted by all countries will be complied with in the past, and then there is hope of success, otherwise it will be futile, why bother? The responsibility of our government lies in maintaining peace in our country, and what the people expect from the government is to strengthen defense so that it can resist foreign attacks and win victory. However, if we act in accordance with the current neutrality law, once a war breaks out abroad, the warring countries will not be able to purchase from the United States the goods necessary for their self-defense. Is this the way to maintain peace? The late President Jefferson issued a ban on the export of arms during the Anglo-French War in 1807, hoping to maintain neutrality. By 1811, he had to revoke it. Afterwards, the United States still went to war with Britain in 1812, which could not be avoided. "If Jefferson were resurrected, he would also think that maintaining neutrality could not be achieved by passing a piece of legislation. It was like this in 1807, and it is no different in 1939. Logically speaking, all countries that are at risk of being attacked, whether in peacetime or in wartime, should be allowed to purchase from our country the goods necessary for their self-defense, including military fire. This is the best way for the American people to protect peace. Conversely, if we prevent peace-loving countries (these countries do not threaten our country's security and interests) from purchasing necessary goods to prevent the aggression of other countries, it is to encourage a certain country to pursue a hegemonic policy, which is of no benefit to our country's interests and world peace." (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)

(New York) The Institute of Public Opinion recently conducted another public opinion test. The question was whether the current neutrality law should be amended so that the United States could supply arms to Britain and France in the event of a war in Europe. The test results showed that 57% approved and 43% opposed (Havas Telegraph of the 14th)

### Roosevelt's Speech: Cooperation Among American Countries; Efforts to Promote Common Civilization; This Undertaking Has Now Been Completed

(Washington) President Roosevelt recently delivered a broadcast speech today, explaining the results of cooperation among the countries of the American continent in maintaining peace, as well as the future relations between the American continent and the European continent. He said roughly that the American republics have been working hard to promote common civilization under the peace system for more than half a century. This undertaking has now been completed. The countries of North and South America have formed an important cooperative group, and in a troubled world, they are in a calm state. Now the old world has become an old-fashioned duel arena again. What can we rely on to protect ourselves from the tragedy that has occurred? I think the answer to this is very simple, that is, since the countries of the Americas became free and independent countries, a novel and powerful ideal has arisen accordingly, and the governments of the countries of the Americas have gradually been united. Now, it is required that the relevant authorities of each country pursue a common goal. The Pan-American Congress is held every five years and has been carried out smoothly. However, if other parts of the world want to hold similar meetings, they must first engage in a great war, and only after the warring countries are exhausted can they convene a meeting to seek to restore their devastation. A few days ago, the highest authority of a certain great power delivered a speech, saying that the country has become a "prisoner" in the Mediterranean. A few days later, the head of another great power heard that one of its neighbors had concluded an agreement with another neighbor to defend its independence on its behalf, and pointed out that this agreement was a threat," a "siege." It is known that in the world, there has never been a precedent for a peaceful country to be surrounded, threatened, or imprisoned by other peaceful countries. According to our experience, we also firmly believe that it is impossible. When the Pan-American Peace Conference was held in the capital of Argentina in 1936, we agreed to consult each other in the event of a threat of war. Last summer, when I visited Canada, I declared that if the country was attacked, the United States would provide assistance. Last December, when the Pan-American Peace Conference was held in the capital of Peru, the countries of North and South America also issued a joint declaration, declaring that they would work together to defend the territorial integrity of each country. All of this is for the sake of defending peace, and we have no provocative concept. If others do not attack the American continent, then the above-mentioned resolutions and declarations will be useless. (To be continued) (Havas News Agency Telegraph of the 14th)

### Forty German Warships Went to the Atlantic for Exercises and Will Go to Spanish Ports; All Sectors in the United Kingdom Value This Greatly

(Berlin) Official sources recently issued a bulletin stating that forty German warships, including two battleships, two cruisers, two destroyer flotillas totaling six ships, two submarine flotillas totaling ten ships, and twenty other auxiliary ships, are scheduled to sail from the ports of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven to the Atlantic Ocean at 6 p.m. today to conduct spring cruises, and will anchor in the ports of Spain and Portugal, the ports of Spanish Morocco, and the international neutral territory of Tangier. German fleets go to the Atlantic Ocean for spring cruises, which is a traditional practice, but it has been interrupted since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. There is no other intention in restoring it now. As far as those familiar with the news know, German warships will cruise in the Atlantic Ocean and will not enter the Mediterranean Sea. (Havas Telegraph of the 14th)

(Berlin) Official sources here said that the German naval spring exercises will be held in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Spain, but Reuters learned that one or two ships may enter the Mediterranean Sea at that time. (Reuters Telegraph of the 14th)

(London) Official sources recently announced that the German government has notified the governments of the United Kingdom and France that the country's naval spring exercises this year will be held on the sea off Spain for a period of one month. The participants in the exercises include three "Deutschland-class" cruisers, submarines and auxiliary ships, which will sail from their bases to West Country on the 18th of this month. Naval figures here recently commented that if naval fleets of various countries are greatly mobilized, they must notify each other. This is an international practice. The competent authorities here said that at a time when the situation in Europe is serious, Germany's move has great significance both politically and militarily. It has recently been rumored that when Spain joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, an annex was signed allowing Germany to use the country's naval bases. Judging from this incident, it seems to be credible. Although it is inconvenient to make a judgment on the future impact, it should be closely watched. As far as the defense of the British port of Gibraltar is concerned, the government has recently taken special technical measures to renovate the Jin Cheng Tangchi, which is extremely solid. We are not afraid of attacks from the sea or from the land. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)

(London) The matter of forty German warships going to cruise on the sea off Spain was recently commented on by diplomatic figures here, who said roughly that Germany's intention was to threaten General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish National Army, to make the National Army government more subservient to the military alliance treaty after joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, or at least want the National Army government to agree to threaten the traffic lines on the Atlantic Ocean in wartime. This attempt is indeed fraught with crises, but experts believe that, apart from submarines, German warships cannot actually do much even if they use the ports of the West Country. If General Franco openly sides with Germany, Italy and Er in the future, if a war breaks out, the German warships anchored in the ports of the West Country will be immediately blockaded by the British and French fleets, making it impossible for them to cross the minefield. In essence, German warships will find it very difficult to compete with the British fleet. At most, they will only attack the traffic lines for transporting food to Britain and France in wartime. (Havas Telegraph of the 14th)

### Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army in West Country Postpones Entry into Madrid

Burgos: General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, was originally scheduled to enter Madrid on the 2nd of next month in a triumphant ceremony. It is now heard that the date has been changed again, and the date has not been determined. It is generally believed that the date will be postponed to the 15th of next month. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has provided assurances to the United Kingdom, stating that the country's volunteer soldiers will return to their country immediately after General Franco enters Madrid. (Havas Telegraph of the 14th)

### British Engineering Teams Deploy Defenses North of Gibraltar; There Are Also Military Operations Within the Spanish Border

Gibraltar: More than 100 British engineers are currently engaged in building obstacles on the main road north of Gibraltar. Cars and buses are not allowed to enter or leave the fortress area after sunset. This is a precautionary plan. Since April 8, there have been military activities in Algeciras, Spain, and other Spanish places connected to Gibraltar. Every day, we see ground artillery and tanks being transported to the Spanish city of La Lina, and hundreds of Italian soldiers have arrived there. (Reuters Telegraph of the 14th)

Gibraltar: The port of La Linea in southern Spain (adjacent to the port of Gibraltar) has been under strict guard for days, and a large amount of military fire has been transported from the port of Cadiz, including field artillery, machine guns, tanks, and ammunition. There are also two to three thousand National Army troops who have been arriving there since the 11th of this month, most of them stationed in the bullring. Residents there who came to this port all expressed their unease about this move. In addition, many large transport ships have recently been traveling between the ports of Ceuta and Melilla in Spanish Morocco in North Africa and Algiers in southern Spain. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)

Gibraltar: After the Spanish National Army government concentrated troops in the vicinity of this port, the military authorities here have also taken appropriate precautions to be vigilant. Two hundred sappers have been working overnight to build solid obstacles on the northern highway 200 meters from the British-Spanish border. It is heard that the authorities of the Spanish port of La Linea have ordered the requisition of all kinds of vehicles in the city. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)

Gibraltar: The army attache and naval attache of the French Embassy in Spain arrived here this afternoon from the Spanish city of Burgos. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)

(Paris) Political figures here recently declared that it is disturbing to feel that Spain may once again become the center of international incidents at this time. Although the Italian government has provided assurances to the United Kingdom, stating that it is willing to withdraw volunteer soldiers from Spain as soon as possible, the information received here is to the contrary. For example, the Spanish National Army government has taken military measures near the British port of Gibraltar and in Spanish Morocco, one; one-third of the German fleet has sailed to the sea off Spain, two; German newspapers have suddenly advocated that Spain's position is very important, three; foreign troops and ordnance continue to arrive at the port of Cadiz in southern Spain, four; although the Spanish National Army government has issued daily communiqués denying this, the news that comes is often contrary to this communiqué. Since the National Army government joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, German newspapers have taken the opportunity to exaggerate their wishes for Spain. It is estimated that the recent developments in Spain are a response by certain countries to the security of Greece and Romania guaranteed by the United Kingdom and France, with the obvious purpose of planning ahead and seeking a base in wartime. The United Kingdom and France should pay close attention to it. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)

### Fascist Party of Italy Approves Annexation of Albania

(Rome) The Albanian National Assembly yesterday resolved to offer the Albanian crown to Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia. The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party, meeting at 10 PM tonight, concluded after twenty-five minutes and immediately approved the acceptance. Afterwards, Party Secretary Starace read a public statement to over forty thousand citizens, stating briefly: 1. The Italian and Albanian nations, based on generations of friendship, have established a deeper and more certain relationship. The Supreme Fascist Council welcomes this historical event with a heroic attitude. Fascist Italy, with its strong soldiers and sharp weapons, will surely protect the brave Albanian nation, respect its religious beliefs, and lay the foundation for civil progress and social justice to achieve peace. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

(Rome) After the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party adjourned, Prime Minister Mussolini addressed the crowd, saying that the historical events that have occurred in recent days are the result of our will, confidence, and strength. We will treat those who treat us with friendship with a friendly attitude, and we will respond to those who are hostile to us with a clear and resolute hostile attitude. The crowd then shouted various slogans such as "Down with France", "March on Paris", "Tunisia", and "Corsica". The Prime Minister then continued, "We are carrying out great work every day. We hope that the countries of the world will not interfere. We only know how to move forward and never look back. This has been the case in the past, and it will be the case in the future. This is what all countries in the world should understand." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

(Rome) The Fascist Professional Association Parliament is scheduled to formally convene tomorrow to approve the title of King of Albania to King Victor Emmanuel III. At that time, the Albanian delegation will also attend and present the crown to the King. Foreign Minister Ciano will also deliver an important speech explaining the situation in Europe. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Göring to Visit Rome, Italian Authorities Anticipate

### German and Italian Policies Unaffected After Anglo-French Declaration, Poland, Greece and Romania Express Welcome, British Newspapers Mostly Disappointed with Inadequate Appeasement

(London) Rome and Berlin's initial reaction to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today suggests that both Italy and Germany remain steadfast and without regrets. Upon receiving news of Britain's guarantee of assistance to Romania, the people of Rome were overjoyed, and officials expressed their gratification. Everywhere, cries of "brave" were heard. The Hungarian view is that the British Prime Minister's remarks neither reduced nor increased the severity of the international situation, and they felt that the situation remained quite serious, with everything depending on the subsequent actions of Italy and Germany. German officials will not issue criticisms until they have carefully studied the full text of the British Prime Minister's remarks. However, foreign news agencies published an officially authorized declaration condemning many points in the British Prime Minister's statement and severely criticizing British propaganda methods. Italian political circles, based on brief reports of the British Prime Minister's remarks, expressed the opinion that the British Prime Minister's words, properly interpreted, acknowledged that Italy's occupation of Albania did not violate the Anglo-Italian Agreement and made the same observation regarding the situation in the Mediterranean. They expressed doubts about Britain's ability to implement its guarantees to Romania and Greece, as well as about Britain's guarantees to Poland. They also believed that Italy's guarantee to Greece made Britain's guarantee to that country superfluous. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

(London) After Britain and France simultaneously gave guarantees to Greece and Romania, diplomatic circles here have stated that these unilateral guarantees may be converted into mutual assistance agreements, but this is not important at present. Britain, France, Greece, and Romania have thus united, and the ongoing negotiations between the related countries can now focus on Turkey alone, and the mutual assistance agreement signed between Greece and Romania can be extended to other countries in the Balkan Peninsula. In practical terms, the guarantees given by Britain and France to Romania depend on whether British and French warships can freely pass through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits of Turkey, which is why Britain and France are eager to reach an agreement with Turkey. As for Bulgaria, it has desires regarding Romania's Dobruja province (which originally belonged to Bulgaria), and therefore remains resentful. Although the British government cannot force Romania to reach an agreement with Bulgaria, Turkey, which maintains friendly relations with both countries, is expected to mediate. In addition, some countries in the Balkan Peninsula remain wary of the Soviet Union. The British government now intends to advise these countries to sign sky agreements with the Soviet Union, without establishing general mutual assistance agreements, in order to avoid the possibility of Soviet troops passing through these countries. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

(London) Although all newspapers praised Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration yesterday, conservative newspapers still felt that the government's actions were slow and insufficient. Left-wing newspapers said that Prime Minister Chamberlain only briefly mentioned the Soviet Union when answering questions from opposition parties. The newspapers also welcomed the declaration made by French Prime Minister Daladier and said that the British government's provision of guarantees to Romania was insisted upon by France, so this decision was made only at the last moment. The Labour Party's Daily Herald reported that "the government is considering various emergency measures. Once these measures are put into practice, it will be necessary to convene all the countries concerned, including the Soviet Union, to hold a meeting. The true defensive front of peace-loving countries, working together, will be realized in a timely manner." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

(Washington) Political figures here have expressed satisfaction with the declarations made by the British and French leaders yesterday, saying that the resolute attitude of the leaders of the two major democratic governments is proof that the era of concessions symbolized by the Munich Agreement has indeed ended, and that there is hope for the establishment of "true peace". The US government also took this opportunity to emphasize that the US, Britain, and France all have the responsibility to contain aggression, showing that their ideals are consistent. The newspapers also added favorable comments, saying that Britain and France have decided to reorganize the collective security system. The Democratic New York Times reported, "If Britain and France can truly ally with the Soviet Union to assist small countries, the new collective security system will be strengthened. Looking back at the US Congress, it should promptly revise the Neutrality Act to help the democratic countries of Europe. "The Republican New York Herald Tribune, speaking of the lack of sincerity of the dictators, stated, "The promises provided by Italy are worthless, and no different from the promises provided by its partner, National Socialism. Looking ahead, the establishment of peace in Europe is a long way off. As for whether it can survive for the time being, it also depends on whether the German-Italian axis can temporarily stop its activities." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

(Paris) Diplomatic circles here attach great importance to the fact that Britain and France have given guarantees to Romania, saying that the Romanian government was deeply afraid that Germany would use the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France as an excuse to take action. Therefore, Britain and France gave Romania unilateral guarantees before its Foreign Minister Gafencu went to Berlin to strengthen its position. This is a worthwhile thing to do. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

(Berlin) Regarding the British Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that Britain had provided unilateral assistance guarantees to Romania and Greece, political figures here believe that Britain is continuing to pursue a policy of encircling Germany. German political figures pointed out that Germany and Romania already had an economic agreement in place, and Italy and Greece had exchanged notes, so the motivation for Britain's guarantee was not out of a love of peace, but based on Britain's military interests. It has been more than a day since Britain sought naval bases in the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. If a war were to break out, Greece would conclude an agreement with Britain to provide the above naval bases for use. This is the old trick of the Allied Powers forcing Greece to join World War I. In 1915, after British and French troops landed in Salonika, Greece still refused to participate in the war. Thereupon, the Allied Powers announced a blockade and occupied the ports of Athens and Piraeus. King Constantine was forced to abdicate, and the Greek army was disarmed. Then Greece participated in the Allied forces in the war. From this point of view, Greece's acceptance of the guarantee this time is probably considered better than being forced to comply, thereby avoiding a second British "aggression." (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

The Romanian capital's newspapers attached great importance to the declaration issued by the British and French leaders guaranteeing Romania and Greece. The newspaper Universul stated that "to this day, Britain and France have accepted military constraints, thereby establishing a collective security system to resist aggressive policies. This move is purely defensive and has no provocative or aggressive implications. Since our country's policy is to maintain its territorial integrity and sovereign independence, there is no reason to refuse such unilateral guarantees from Britain and France. "The newspaper Timpul stated that "the fact that the British and French leaders automatically gave guarantees to our country is a sign of friendship and can only be strengthened by this increased guarantee." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Warsaw: After French Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech yesterday, advocating for the strengthening of the Franco-Polish alliance treaty, the newspapers here unanimously praised it, saying that the European balance of power could be restored and the hope for peace could be increased. The Warsaw Daily reported that "the possibility of Western European countries maintaining peace has not been completely lost, but it has been decided to fight when necessary. This can be seen in the defense preparations made by Britain and France. The diplomatic policies pursued by Western European countries will certainly achieve great success. In short, after the establishment of a large-scale consultation system, the days when aggressors go unpunished will certainly not be seen again today." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Britain Seeks Soviet Participation in Anti-Aggression Front, Plans to Offer Guarantees to Turkey, and Make Poland Also Guarantee Romania

(London) According to a Reuters reporter, although it was generally expected beforehand that Britain and France would immediately guarantee Greece against aggression, it was thought that the same guarantee might not be given to Romania at this time. It is now learned that British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, after lengthy discussions over the past 24 hours, made the decision to also give guarantees to Romania. It should also be noted that Britain and France's guarantees to Greece and Romania are unilateral actions. Britain now expects Poland to join in guaranteeing Romania and is conducting discussions with Warsaw in this regard. At the same time, Britain is also conducting friendly and frank discussions with Turkey. When the negotiations are completed, Britain will issue a statement expressing Britain's attitude towards Turkey if Turkey is attacked. As for Bulgaria, although there are various difficulties, it is possible that it will eventually join the group of powers. If any country that joins is attacked by Germany or Italy, the other countries will provide assistance. It is heard that the question of how the Soviet Union will participate in the guarantee organization is now receiving close attention. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### British Foreign Secretary Speaks

(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax spoke in the House of Lords today, using the same wording as Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons. He said that if the independence of Greece and Romania is threatened and resistance is deemed necessary, Britain will use all its strength to assist. The British government has notified this declaration to the governments directly concerned and other governments, especially Turkey, because the close relationship between Turkey and Greece is well known to the world. He said that France had also issued the same declaration. In mentioning the withdrawal of Italian troops from Spain, he said that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had told British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine on April 9 that when the Italian troops in Spain withdrew, Italian planes and pilots would also leave. Lord Snell, representing the Labour Party, and Lord Lothian, representing the Liberal Party, then spoke in succession, urging Britain to ally with the Soviet Union, saying that this was absolutely essential. When Halifax mentioned the Soviet Union in responding to the debate, he solemnly stated that the British government must deal with all the real difficulties that it did not create, and said that during these weeks of concern, he had made every effort to inform the Soviet Ambassador Maisky of the government's views and had paid due attention to trust in other areas. All these difficulties may also be felt by other countries. Halifax also assured the House of Lords that the government's intention was nothing other than to resolutely unite all those who could respect international relations and matters related to us that needed to be guaranteed to the best of its ability to eliminate various difficulties. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### British Opposition Expresses Disappointment

(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain made a declaration in the House of Commons this afternoon, Opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee spoke after him, expressing disappointment. He said, "Prime Minister Mussolini has deliberately violated the obligations he accepted in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. British policy should no longer be based on this agreement. What we ask for is the implementation of a genuine guarantee policy, not for a week or half a month, but to establish a lasting collective security system. It is a pity that the Prime Minister did not say a word about the Soviet Union's position. How can we establish a collective security system without Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as the axis, thereby uniting all peace-loving forces around this axis? In short, if the government is unwilling to take resolute measures, it will be easier to begin with." Opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair then spoke, also saying that it was necessary for Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to establish a close and resolute cooperative relationship, but it was a pity that the Prime Minister did not say a word about the Soviet Union. For the present plan, our country must reorganize the cabinet. "Former Foreign Secretary Eden and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill were full of sacrifice and were able to adhere to sound and unpopular principles. If they could serve as Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, the British people would receive great encouragement in this dark age. In addition, the cabinet should add a Ministry of Munitions. After guaranteeing the security of various countries in Europe, if we cannot follow up with aircraft, ammunition, and troops in addition to warships in the event of war, then guarantees are nothing but empty words." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

(London) At the House of Commons meeting yesterday afternoon, Opposition Labour Party MP Dalton gave a speech, strongly stating that with regard to the collective security organization, Britain should invite the Soviet Union to participate or sponsor it, but he did not know whether the government had made a proposal to the Soviet government and wanted to hear the details. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon immediately replied that the government had invited the Soviet Union to sponsor the new policy at the beginning of its implementation, and that the government had maintained the closest contact with the Soviet government throughout the negotiations with the countries concerned, "Because where else can we obtain assistance? The matter is very clear. If we cannot understand this, wouldn't we be extremely foolish? In short, we have absolutely no intention of excluding the Soviet Union. We are fully aware of the contribution that the Soviet Union can make to maintaining peace." Therefore, the government does not oppose any proposal that advocates a military alliance treaty with that country. Political figures here attached great importance to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's remarks, saying that Sir Cadogan, a high-ranking official of the Foreign Office, had been in close contact with him before the Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke, so the Chancellor of the Exchequer's wording was very precise. Sir Seeds visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov this morning to explain Britain's intentions and inquire about the Soviet Union's true intentions. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Chamberlain's Declaration Full Text

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered his policy on the international situation to the House of Commons this afternoon after the Easter recess resumed its session. He first addressed the Albanian incident, saying it was difficult to obtain information about Albania. Foreign Secretary Halifax is still awaiting information from the British envoy stationed in Albania. As for the news coming from Italy-Albania, it is contradictory and should be left until the truth of the incident is known before making a judgment. Italy's actions have deeply shocked the world. As far as Britain is concerned, we must ask ourselves how the Albanian incident can be consistent with the Anglo-Italian Agreement. The Prime Minister then quoted the preamble of the agreement, continuing, "I dare to say that Britain and the world both feel that Italy's actions in Albania not only fail to contribute to general peace and security but will also cause continued disturbances and increase international tension." As for the current situation stipulated in the agreement, British Ambassador to Italy, Percy, and Foreign Secretary Halifax, concerned about this point, have stated that the overall situation will seriously involve the entire issue of maintaining the current situation. Maintaining the current situation is one of the important factors in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. The Adriatic Sea is indeed part of the Mediterranean Sea, and the Italian government cannot hastily claim that Britain has nothing to do with it." The Prime Minister recalled that on April 7, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano still claimed that the Italian government intended to respect Albania's independence and integrity, and the status quo in the Mediterranean. On April 9, the British government notified the Italian government that Britain was paying close attention to this and other guarantees but was deeply worried after receiving the news of the sudden Italian military invasion of Albania. If the situation between Italy and Albania was as described by the Italian Foreign Minister, then it was unbelievable that disputes could not be resolved through negotiations. Furthermore, we are even more puzzled as to how the Italian military's landing in Albania can be consistent with the promise to maintain Albania's independence and integrity. Percy told the Italian Foreign Minister that Britain felt that a very clear and full explanation of Italy's intentions regarding the situation in Albania should be obtained to dispel doubts. The explanations the British government has received to date have caused it deep concern and cannot satisfy British public opinion. The Italian Foreign Minister, pressed by Percy, stated that Italy's future intentions would depend on the wishes of the Albanian people. According to recent news, the Albanian provincial government has offered the Albanian King to the Italian King. We must now wait for the Italian government to provide its confirmation of this. Regardless of the outcome, the British government feels that Albania's situation is extremely difficult to reconcile with what was contemplated in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. This not only puts Albania's future in danger, (cheers from the audience) but also causes unrest among all regions bordering Albania and other countries bordering the Mediterranean or in the Balkan Peninsula. The Prime Minister did not want to elaborate in detail to disturb the House of Commons but wanted to present evidence of this fact. On April 11, Italian Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Colonna, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax and informed him of the matters. During this meeting, the British Foreign Secretary told the Chargé d'Affaires that the British government had no intention of occupying Corfu but would take a very serious view if another country occupied it (cheers from the audience). Subsequently, the British Minister to Greece reported that the Greek government had received information that Italy intended to occupy Corfu in the near future. This information was later confirmed by the Greek Minister to Britain. The British Foreign Secretary then informed the Italian Chargé d'Affaires of this news. The Italian Chargé d'Affaires said that he dared to assert that this news was absolutely untrue and was willing to guarantee that this was not the policy of the Italian government. The British Foreign Secretary, while welcoming this guarantee, stated that there should be no misunderstanding between the two governments on this point. This was absolutely essential. On the same day, the Italian Chargé d'Affaires received a letter from Mussolini reaffirming that Italy intended to respect Greece's territorial integrity to the British Foreign Office. (cheers from the audience) I have said several times before that once trust is shaken, it is not easy to restore it. The British government now feels that it is its inescapable duty to ensure that there is no doubt in people's minds about its position. Therefore, I take this opportunity to declare that the British government considers it extremely important to avoid the disturbance of the status quo in the Mediterranean and the Balkan Peninsula by force or the threat of force. The government has therefore decided that in the event of any clear action endangering the independence of Greece or Romania, and if the Greek or Romanian government deems it necessary to resist with its national force, the British government will immediately assist the Greek and Romanian governments with all its strength. (cheers from the audience) We are now communicating this declaration to the governments directly concerned and other governments. I know that the French government is also making a similar declaration. I have one or two more views to inform the House of Commons. As far as I am concerned, the British government's policy of signing the Anglo-Italian Agreement a year ago was quite correct, and no event has made me change this belief. (cheers from the audience) I am doing this not to provoke disputes but to avoid misunderstandings about my attitude today. I am extremely disappointed with Italy's actions in Albania. Today, some will naturally argue that we should declare the Anglo-Italian Agreement null and void, but I do not hold this view. Even today, no one seems willing to take responsibility for doing anything that would increase international tension. Therefore, I believe the general desire is to see the provisions of the agreement fulfilled. In light of recent events, the Italian government must, of course, provide us with the practical evidence we expect, showing that Italy shares this desire. The Prime Minister continued that during recent exchanges of views, the Italian government had told the British government that the Italian troops in Spain would be withdrawn after the victory parade in Madrid. The British government had taken note of this and new assurances and had always regarded the withdrawal of Italian volunteers from Spain as a crucial factor in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. We have been patient for a long time. Although our efforts to eliminate misunderstandings, promote goodwill, and maintain peace have been hampered by many obstacles, I firmly believe that these efforts will eventually bear fruit. The Prime Minister then declared that he had not mentioned the Soviet Union not because he had not maintained close contact with the Soviet representative regarding the situation but out of respect for the wishes of other peoples. We must insist on making concessions so that we are not only capable of defending ourselves but also able to fulfill our duty to assist those countries that encounter aggression or are in danger of losing their freedom and decide to resist. When the Prime Minister spoke, the ambassadors of China, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Poland, France, and Brazil, the ministers of Romania, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Albania, Turkey, Finland, and Peru, the commissioners of Canada, South Africa, and Ireland stationed in London were in the audience. The Duke of Kent was in the House of Lords. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)

### Spanish Civil War Deaths and Injuries Total 1.2 Million

Madrid Since the outbreak of the civil war in July 1936, the number of deaths and injuries is said to be as high as 1.2 million. Among them, about 450,000 are soldiers, and about 750,000 civilians were executed or died in artillery fire. As for the Nationalist forces, due to their superior weaponry, the number of deaths and injuries is only more than 130,000. (Havas dispatch from the 14th)

### Japanese Troops Invade Jiangmen; Chinese Troops Launch Three-Pronged Counterattack; Japanese Army Suffers Heaviest Losses Since Invading Guangdong; Attempt to Land in Taishan by Sending Warships Fails

Hong Kong dispatch: Although the Guangzhou Japanese army has been repeatedly reinforced recently, the reinforcements, having just arrived on transport ships from the south, are then distributed to various locations. Recently, two regiments were divided, invading Xinhui and Heshan by land and water. Those taking the land route mostly advanced from Foshan, Jiujiang, and Shunde to invade the Jiangmen line. Those invading the Jiangmen line mostly concentrated at Zhutoushan by ship from Huangpu, then landed from Beijie to attempt to seize the Ningyang Railway. The battles near Xinhui City have been fierce for days. Jiangmen has undergone several seesaw battles. Since Beijie in Jiangmen has no defenses, even if the Chinese army captures Jiangmen, strategically, it must be abandoned again. The complete recovery of Jiangmen and Xinhui City can only be achieved after the Japanese army's maritime reinforcements are cut off. Therefore, the current battle in Xinhui depends on the transfer of military situation in the east, west, and north of Guangzhou. The Chinese army is currently adopting a strategy of "besieging Wei to rescue Zhao," taking advantage of the Japanese army's attempt to seize Xinhui and the Ningyang Railway, and launching a sudden counterattack on the northeast, west three rivers. In recent days, progress has been quite rapid. It is estimated that the eastern Chinese army, starting from the third day, attacked Zengcheng from Pingfengling, Zhaiding, and Hululing, and successively captured Lizhiao and Longhuzhai. The Japanese army in Zengcheng has been surrounded. The Northern Guangdong army, on the 6th day at dawn, attacked the Xinji Station in the southern section of the Canton-Hankow Railway. The station had strong Japanese fortifications, which were bombed by Chinese aircraft in advance, followed by an infantry assault, recapturing the strongholds between Xinji and Huaxian. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army advanced steadily. On the evening of the 6th, they once stormed Jiangcun. Jiangcun is only tens of miles away from the northwest suburbs of Guangzhou. Guangzhou citizens faintly heard artillery fire. The Japanese army in Guangzhou hurriedly dispatched reinforcements and densely shelled Jiangcun, while the Japanese army from Huaxian outflanked the northeast of Huaxian. For strategic considerations, the Chinese army temporarily withdrew from Jiangcun that night to attack the Japanese army in the northeast of Huaxian with all its strength. The Japanese army eventually retreated to Longkouzhuang. Also, Shijiaoxu and Yangcun, south of Huaxian, were all recovered by the Chinese army. As for the Guangdong army on the west river front, they launched simultaneous attacks on the evening of the 5th. The Japanese army responded in a panic. On the 6th, they finally could not hold on. Makou, Rongkou, Yangmei, and the old Sanshui County seat were successively recovered by the Guangdong army. Guanyao in Sanjiang, Nanhai County, which is located at the hub of the northwest rivers, usually had six to seven hundred Japanese troops. That night, more than half of them were wiped out by the Guangdong army. Since the Japanese army entered Guangdong, the above-mentioned several battles have been the most severe losses suffered.

The Japanese army, which has been invading Xinhui for days, has not only made no progress, but also suffered from the failure of the Japanese army in the east, west, and north rivers. Most of them have no intention of fighting. The hardware products looted from Jiangmen and Xinhui a few days ago were moved away by ships. In addition to the raw materials for hardware, there were also five to six hundred Japanese soldiers killed, all of which were transported by boat from Beijie to the cremation area for cremation. Since Jiangmen was subjected to war, many shops have been destroyed by bombing, and those that still exist have either been looted or closed. Jiangmen Inner River is a waterway that must be passed through by the five counties. At this moment, due to military relations, the land routes from Jiangmen to Heshan or from Xinhui to Taishan Kaiping have been destroyed. Refugees from Xinhui are now fleeing to Lilexu in the southwest of Jiangmen, and then from Lilexu to Zhongshan County, and then from Zhongshan to Macau by land. If they go to Siyi from Macau without passing through Jiangmen, they can only follow the waterway to Sanjiang Longshuikou in Xinzeng, and then follow the land to Gongyibu in Taishan. The Japanese army believes that the coastline of Taishan is very long, and giant ships can berth near Shangchuan and Xiachuan Islands. Recently, they plan to land in Guanghai to contain the Guangdong army aiding Jiangmen from Siyi. In recent days, more than 20 Japanese warships, more than 10 rubber boats, and six or seven speedboats were suddenly anchored on the sea surface at the junction of Chixi and Taishan counties. About five to six hundred Japanese marines on board the ships sent more than a hundred soldiers on the evening of the 5th of the month, riding speedboats and armored fishing boats to the coast of Guanghai, attempting to sneak across. At the same time, Japanese warships fired artillery at the shore. On the afternoon of the 6th, the second invasion occurred. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers, under the cover of naval artillery fire, rushed to the coast of Guanghai Shadi. At first, the local national team maintained a tight guard. When the Japanese soldiers approached the shore, they fired a barrage of artillery fire. After about an hour of standoff, the Japanese soldiers, knowing that China was prepared, took boats and retreated. At this moment, the local defense army has destroyed the coastal highway to prevent the Japanese army from landing and attacking Siyi. (April 8)

### Situation After the Fall of Wuhan (Continued) - Talks by Returnees from Wuhan

Japanese Soldiers are Lewd and Weary of War

The enemy has established many brothels in Hankou to comfort the imperial army. Each prostitute has to have relations with more than 40 Japanese soldiers every day. Japanese soldiers line up to go to the brothels every day, and each person holds a wooden token. The prostitute then collects the wooden tokens and goes to the Japanese military camp to collect money. In addition, incidents of rape and shooting occur frequently every day.

The airport in Hankou is two or three times larger than before, and enemy planes are often parked there. Their military supplies are mostly placed along the riverbank, but they are often moved. According to the porters, the ammunition boxes are very light, and so are the oil tanks. I don't know why.

Shenjiamiao and Hanzheng Street are designated as refugee areas. The food supply in the refugee area is often not up to date. The refugee area in Wuchang is the Wenhua University. Some refugees have run out of food. Bishop Meng of Huazhong University distributed rice to the refugee area, saying to the refugees, "This rice is not distributed by us, but was left to you by your chairman when he withdrew from Wuhan. He instructed me to distribute it to you now. You must never forget your chairman." The refugees were very moved when they heard this.

From many places, we can see the anti-war situation of the enemy army. Once, a Japanese military policeman in the refugee area said to a few refugees, "If you want to die, you die ten minutes before us. Now you are surrounded by three circles." As he spoke, he drew three circles with his hands. The first circle indicated the refugees, the second circle indicated the Japanese army, and the outer big circle indicated the encirclement of our army. As he spoke, he wiped a gap in the second circle with his hand, saying, "We will die here in the future." In addition, Japanese soldiers often asked the refugees, "Do you have a wife? Do you have children? Do you have parents?" They took out photos of their wives to show everyone. They all knew that they were sent to Central China to fight and had no hope of returning.

The Ugly Types of Traitors are Revealed

What makes us sad and indignant is that on the New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, a child was brutally killed by Japanese soldiers for singing the "March of the Volunteers" on the street. Again, on the day the maintenance association was established, Japanese soldiers distributed five-color flags and sun flags on the street to celebrate. A group of children, moved by patriotic indignation, broke the paper flags. After being discovered by Japanese soldiers, they were also brutally murdered.

A week after the Japanese army invaded Wuhan, a "Wuhan News" was published, which was the enemy's propaganda newspaper. There is also an irregular newspaper that is often found on the market, called "Li News." The content inside is aimed at the Wuhan News. No one knows where the Li News is published. There is also something that excites us: some children who sell newspapers, when they meet Japanese soldiers, shout, "Wuhan News, Wuhan News," but when they enter the concession gate, they jump up and shout, "The Central Army has surrounded the Wuhan newspaper, the guerrillas have entered the Wuhan... newspaper." From this, we know how much the refugees in the occupied areas are looking forward to us fighting back. Several times when our planes bombed the South Lake Airport in Wuchang, Xujiazha, and Luojia Mountain, the compatriots said, "As long as we see our planes come to bomb, we are willing to be bombed to death." From this, we can see that the sons and daughters of our Chinese nation will never surrender to the enemy.

The current traitor organizations and responsible persons of the maintenance association in Wuhan are mostly people who used to be active in the Wuhan business community. The manager of the game hall is the chairman of the maintenance association. People like Yang Huiting, Li Ding'an, and Jin Longzhang are all important responsible figures of the maintenance association. There is also an "Association of Students Returned from Japan," which is also the most powerful traitor organization. What we need to pay attention to is that some of the people who used to do salvation work in Wuhan have now become traitors. This is something that we must pay the most attention to in the future. (The End)

### Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce Criticizes Japanese Methods of Oppressing Foreign Businesses; Marshall Lists the Facts to Prove Japanese Discrimination Against Third-Country Nationals

The Continental Daily News reported that Sir Marshall, Chairman of the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech at the Chamber's annual meeting last night (the 13th), strongly denouncing Japan's oppressive measures against foreign businesses in the occupied areas, saying that "military needs" or consideration for the welfare of foreign shipping cannot now be recognized as valid reasons for blockading the Yangtze River and prohibiting foreign merchant ships from navigating. Other significant observations made by Marshall were: (1) Regulations promulgated by Japan due to military actions, such as those implemented in Qingdao and the Yangtze River, discriminate against third-country nationals; (2) Although protests have been lodged, it seems that Japan has not yet understood its obligations to third-country nationals; (3) Trade with various ports along the Yangtze River estuary has proceeded normally, but Japan has recently used commercially rare means to deprive British ships of trade; (4) Japan, while claiming that it earnestly hopes to revive its invaded areas, refuses to return privately-owned factories to their legitimate owners; (5) The "North China Customs Permit" regulations are discriminatory and close the open door. Trade in North China has virtually come to a standstill.

Japanese Discrimination Against Third-Country Nationals Marshall's speech first explained the Chamber's work in the past year, mostly related to issues arising from the Sino-Japanese War. He then said that in the past year, as battles continued on the front lines, the Japanese army has occupied North China, Central China, and South China. The most important ports and commercial markets have made it impossible for the National Government to utilize most of its customs revenue. The regulations promulgated by Japan due to military actions discriminate against third-country nationals. Judging from simple telegrams regarding the Central China Development Company, Japan's attempt to monopolize has become a reality.

North and East Areas Remain Closed Indefinitely Sixteen months have passed since the outbreak of the war in the Shanghai area, and restrictions are still imposed on Chinese people entering the North and East Areas, preventing them from rebuilding their industries in these two areas. The British-owned tram and bus companies, which have the privileges of the Municipal Council, are also unable to operate in these two areas, but the Japanese bus company, which has not obtained any legal rights, operates on the north bank of the Suzhou River.

Monopolizing the Yangtze River to Promote Japanese Goods Trade in Shanghai depends on free access to the interior. Any obstruction to the Yangtze River basin, Sichuan, and North China ports would be a fatal blow. War naturally obstructs trade routes, but "military needs and consideration for the welfare of foreign shipping cannot now be recognized as valid reasons for completely blockading the Yangtze River and prohibiting foreign merchant ships from navigating." In the past, Japanese merchant ships have been carrying goods to and from the ports along the Yangtze River. Japanese shipping companies have published advertisements in Chinese newspapers to transport goods to the interior. Japanese or Sino-Japanese joint ventures have also been opened in various ports along the Yangtze River. This is a very important matter for British merchants and British shipping. British trade and navigation have temporarily come to a standstill, while Japan has temporarily monopolized trade and navigation on the Yangtze River. Protests have been lodged against this in the past and will continue to be lodged in the future, but it seems that Japan has not understood its obligations to third-country nationals. At present, there is no satisfactory solution in sight.

Complete Domination of Inland Waterway Transportation Trade between the ports along the Yangtze River estuary is now proceeding normally, but Japan has recently used commercially rare means to prevent Chinese boatmen from approaching British ships, thus depriving British ships of trade. Japan's monopoly of inland waterway transportation also has a significant impact on British trade. Japan's control over all inland navigation in China is using discriminatory means, which directly violates the treaty rights enjoyed by Britain.

Illegal Confiscation of Chinese Factories One of the main features of 1938 was the establishment of a large number of factories in the Western District, demonstrating the courage and determination of Chinese industry. Although their factories in Yangshupu and other industrial centers have been lost, they have not hesitated to re-establish businesses in areas where they feel they can be free from interference. Although most are small-scale, they are progressing smoothly and will expand and lay a solid foundation. Many important factories of Chinese merchants in the Eastern District have been destroyed or stolen. If they have started operations, they are not managed by the original owners. It is heard that in Wuxi and Changzhou districts, which were formerly important industrial centers, many undamaged machines have been transported away by the Japanese army. Japan, while claiming that it earnestly hopes to promote the revival of its invaded areas, refuses to return privately-owned factories to their legitimate owners unless on the condition that they be jointly managed by Japanese and share the profits. Although Japan denies confiscating privately-owned factories or having the intention of confiscating them, the facts are all there. Whether confiscated or not, Japanese have forcibly occupied many factories and started operations without obtaining the permission of the original Chinese owners.

Many Goods at Wharves Go Missing Goods stored at Japanese wharves and China Merchants Bureau wharves could not be shipped out due to the war. Most have now been returned to their legitimate owners, but some have gone missing. Since the beginning of the war, both wharves have been under the control of the Japanese army and navy authorities. The Japanese authorities are therefore directly responsible for the disappearance of the goods.

The National Government Repays Foreign Debt In May 1938, the British and Japanese governments concluded a treaty stipulating that the customs revenue of the occupied ports should be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank in the name of the Superintendent of Customs to repay a portion of the foreign debt. It should be handed over when needed and stipulates that the National Government should pay Japan's funds. Because the National Government did not join the treaty and did not approve it, although the customs revenue has been deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, the treaty has not been fulfilled as far as the repayment of foreign debt is concerned. However, the National Government still repaid all foreign debt until December 31, 1938, when it announced that it would no longer fully repay foreign debt from January 1, 1939, and would use a percentage of the debt service payments from the revenue from the ports still under the management of the National Government and deposit it in the Central Bank.

Important Railways Operated Arbitrarily As a result of the Japanese army's invasion, China's important railways have been occupied by Japan, which are currently operating them. Japan disregards the fact that most of these railways are pledged to foreign bondholders and refuses to allow the representatives of the bondholders to investigate the condition of their property or manage a portion of it. Japan is now operating these railways, taking all the revenue, causing the bondholders to be temporarily deprived of their legitimate rights.

Issuing Banknotes to Control Foreign Exchange On February 11, 1938, the "United Reserve Bank," controlled by Japan, was established in North China. On March 10 of the same year, it issued banknotes with insufficient reserves. On March 11 of this year, the "Provisional Government" of North China promulgated regulations intended to force North China to use "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, which could not be freely converted into foreign exchange, in order to drive out legal tender with definite foreign exchange value. To facilitate the repayment of its wishes, the Customs forbade the export of certain major export commodities from North China. They must be exchanged for "United Reserve Bank" banknotes at the rate of one shilling and two pence per foreign exchange through the Yokohama Specie Bank before they can be exported. This rule automatically establishes a financial monopoly favorable to Japanese banks in North China. Although exporters are affected first, importers of foreign goods other than Japanese will soon be affected as well. There is no guarantee that the foreign exchange obtained from the export of goods can be used as capital for importing goods. The regulations are indeed discriminatory and violate the principle of the open door. The direct impact has been that trade in North China has virtually come to a standstill.

All Policies Are Clearly Exclusionary Judging from the news received from North China and Central China last year, the experiences in this port, and the news about the Central China Development Company, it is clear that Japan is adopting a policy that is favorable to Japan and the Japanese people. Japan claims that foreigners do not understand its intentions, but if these intentions maintain friendship, then there is no reason for the so-called misunderstanding on the part of others. Marshall then made a brief review of the work of the British Chamber of Commerce in the past year, followed by speeches by George, the Honorary Vice President of the Chamber, and the British Commercial Counsellor stationed in Shanghai.

### Regular Chinese Army Closes in on Shangnan Line; Heavy Fighting East of Zhoupu Yesterday Morning; Regular Army Enters Tangkou, Threatening Shangnan Road

Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, guerrilla warfare suddenly erupted in the countryside east of Zhoupu, the terminus of Shangnan Road. The guerrillas engaged in fierce combat with the mixed Japanese-puppet troops. The sound of gunfire and cannons reverberated far and wide. Along the banks of the Pu River, rumors spread that the ambushed guerrillas were also about to rise in response,

Further Tightening the Situation

Two to three hundred Japanese marines and army troops mobilized on Pudong Avenue to set up defenses and guard the area. The Dongchang Road ferry to the opposite bank was also temporarily closed, severing both land and water transportation. A large number of vegetable vendors and Chinese workers employed in Puxi were blocked from returning to Pudong. Subsequently, after completing their mission, the guerrillas retreated to their original base. The fighting subsided at 7:30 AM.

At 8:00 AM, water and land transportation resumed. The guard troops on Pudong Avenue also completely withdrew. Japanese troops at the Shangnan border divided up and searched civilian houses, but found nothing. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Shanghai Ferry Company's Zhoujiadu-bound "Chunjiang Maru," while waiting to load the last batch of passengers to Shanghai at Zhoujiadu, was unexpectedly seized by the Japanese when it sailed to Beishou Nanmatou (three miles from Zhoujiadu).

Temporarily Seized for Troop Transport, all passengers were driven ashore. As of 6:00 PM in the evening, the vessel had not yet returned, and its destination remained unknown. However, it is widely believed that this emergency measure was taken in response to the guerrillas in the Shangnan area. Furthermore, it is learned that Tangkou Town in Pudong, previously occupied by the loyal and patriotic army of Fan Gencai, is now being fiercely attacked by the puppet Nanhui "Self-Defense Corps,"

seeking to seize the tax checkpoint. The puppet troops suffered considerable casualties but remained undeterred. The day before yesterday, they gathered Japanese and "puppet" troops and advanced by land and sea, resulting in fierce fighting. Fan's troops, outnumbered and outmatched, retreated to Lujiahui. Just as the puppet "army" was feeling triumphant, Xu Xinzhou, commander of the Second Regiment of the 45th Brigade of the regular army, personally led his troops to arrive, completely driving out the Japanese and "puppet" troops.

Completely Expelled. The area is now under Xu's control, and Fan's troops have been incorporated into his ranks. Fan himself has gone to Tianmashan. It is said that the fighting has now closed in on the Shangnan Railway.

### Shanghai Volunteer Corps Inspection Ceremony

Chinese Unit to Participate in Full Tomorrow Afternoon

The Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps holds a full corps inspection every year in April or May as an important ceremony marking the end of the annual training. It is now learned that this year's grand review of the corps has been scheduled for tomorrow (the 16th) afternoon. At that time, members of the corps from all countries will participate in the ceremony to demonstrate their proficiency. It is planned that at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of that day, all units will assemble inside the Racecourse. At 2:45 PM, they will form ranks and set off. The review stand will be set up in front of the Shanghai Club on Jing'an Temple Road. The inspection will be conducted by the Commander of the British Forces in China and the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The route of the march will be from the west entrance of the Racecourse, proceeding along Jing'an Temple Road, Xieqiao Road, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road, and a section of Route Tenant de la Tour. It is reported that our Chinese translation team of two squads, with all team members, will still be led by the Chinese Battalion Commander Chen Shixia, Major, and officers Li Yushu, Zhou Qingen, Wang Tingkui, Xu Shaomei, Xia Zaiyu, Zhong Yuting, Zhang Tinggui, etc. The enthusiastic atmosphere at that time can be anticipated.

### First Issue of Construction Bonds, 30 Million Yuan, Already Issued; Banks Accept Mortgages to Help Complete Construction; National Debt Fund Management Committee Manages Funds

In order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and develop the Southwest and Northwest regions, the National Government has approved the issuance of 600 million yuan in national currency of the 28th Year Construction Bonds of the Republic of China, to be issued in two tranches of 300 million yuan each on April 1st and August 1st, respectively, with an interest rate of 6% and a term of 25 years. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles in Shanghai yesterday that the first tranche of the construction bonds has been issued, designating the surplus profits from already established and newly established state-run enterprises and other construction projects, as well as the construction project funds levied from the salt tax, as the fund for principal and interest repayment. The Shanghai National Debt Fund Management Committee will manage the funds. The paying agents are the Central Bank and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications entrusted by it, as well as the Central Trust Bureau. If the designated funds for the bonds are insufficient, the national treasury will allocate the amount required to cover the shortfall. Although the bond face value stipulates full issuance, it is reported that there are no temporary plans to sell or solicit subscriptions from various parties. However, cash is being mortgaged to various banks. Because the government maintains consistent creditworthiness and continues to pay principal and interest on the domestic debts secured by salt tax and customs revenue on time, and because the bonds are reliably guaranteed and the proceeds will be used to complete construction projects, the banks have indicated their acceptance of mortgages to help the government complete domestic construction.

### Negotiations to Unload Cargo Fail; All Portuguese Shipping Halted; Portuguese Merchants Angrily Request Urgent Telegram to Tokyo to Protest; Puppet "Maritime Affairs Bureau" Seizes Opportunity to Covet

The case of Portuguese merchant ships being detained by Japanese warships, totaling as many as ten thousand ships, is extremely serious. The Portuguese Consul visited Miura yesterday, requesting that the cargo be unloaded first, but the Japanese side evaded the issue, and no progress was made. At present, all shipping operations of Portuguese shipping companies have come to a complete standstill, resulting in significant losses. Portuguese merchants yesterday appointed representatives to visit the Portuguese Consul General, requesting that he urgently telegram the embassy in Japan to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government. The "Deyao" and "Awei Mali" ships were delayed in arriving in Shanghai due to circumstances. The details of each situation are described below.

Negotiations to Unload Cargo Fail. Ten Portuguese ships arbitrarily detained by Japanese warships, including the "Tangbei," "Tangqiao," "Meida," "Libin," "Baode," "Lude," "Dade," and "Fulu," are currently anchored in the center of the Yangshupu River at buoys 16 to 19 and are being monitored by Japanese troops. The above-mentioned ships are either sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou or from Wenzhou to Shanghai, carrying cargo such as textiles, sundries, foreign goods, and eggs, paper, sugarcane, and fruit transported from Wenzhou to Shanghai. Some of the cargo, such as eggs and fruit, has been stored for too long and is about to rot. Therefore, the company sent a representative, Mr. Pilila, to negotiate with the Japanese naval intelligence department, requesting permission to unload the cargo first. However, the Japanese side evaded the issue, saying that it would take a few days, and no progress was made. The Portuguese Consul General also visited Japanese Consul Miura again yesterday morning, but it is reported that there were no results.

All Portuguese Shipping Halted. A reporter from the Xiandai News Agency learned from shipping circles yesterday that there are nine Portuguese merchants engaged in shipping operations in the city, including Zhengde Shipping Company, Meili Shipping Company, Huamei Shipping Company, Kangsheng Shipping Company, Atlantic Shipping Company, Gosi De & Co., and Liuzhou Company, with a total of more than 20 ships, sailing on routes such as Shanghai-Zhejiang, Shanghai-Fujian, Xingang, and Beisha. Since the incident of Japanese warships detaining a large number of Portuguese ships occurred on the 5th of this month, due to the seriousness of the issue, all Portuguese ships that have not been detained have temporarily suspended sailing in order to avoid accidents until the case is resolved. As a result, all shipping operations of Portuguese merchants in Shanghai have come to a complete standstill. Although the losses of the shipping companies are clearly estimated, they are very large.

Representatives of Portuguese Merchants Visit Consul General. All Portuguese merchants in the city believe that the detention of the ships has not been resolved, shipping businesses have come to a complete standstill, and even the Portuguese flag on each ship has been forcibly removed by the Japanese side. Regarding the national honor, it is considered to be a great shame. Therefore, they have held several meetings to discuss countermeasures. Representatives were appointed to request the Portuguese Consul General. Yesterday morning, Pilila, the manager of Zhengde Company, also visited the Portuguese Consul General, requesting that the details be telegraphed to the embassy in China as soon as possible to lodge a protest with the Japanese side. At the same time, he telegraphed the Portuguese ambassador to Japan, lodging a serious protest with the Tokyo government, so that the case could be resolved as soon as possible. It is also learned that Portuguese Consul General Elwes has recently been appointed by his government to be transferred to New York as Consul General. He was originally scheduled to depart on the 13th of this month to take up his new post. However, due to the unresolved Portuguese ship detention case, he has postponed his departure in order to focus on handling the matter.

"Deyao" and "Awei Mali" Delayed in Arriving in Shanghai. After a large number of Portuguese merchant ships were detained, all other ships were also suspended. Only the "Awei Mali" ship of Gosi De & Co. continued to sail. The "Awei Mali" ship sailed to Xingang as usual at 10:00 PM on the 12th. The "Deyao" ship, represented by the Italian Yihua Foreign Firm, sailed to Beisha as usual on the morning of the 12th. Both ships were scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday. According to company sources, the "Awei Mali" ship was delayed in arriving in Shanghai due to encountering wind at sea. The "Deyao" ship also did not arrive in port due to damage to its machinery.

Puppet Organization Attempts to Covet. According to a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency, the puppet "Weixin Government Ministry of Communications" recently established a "Maritime Affairs Bureau" in Shanghai in order to seize the authority to manage shipping and register civilian ships on the Huangpu River, thereby increasing revenue. The address of the "Bureau" is 55 North Sichuan Road. It is reported that the "Director" is Zhou Fushi, a disgrace to the shipping industry. After a large number of Portuguese ships were detained, Zhou made a statement to those close to the Portuguese merchants, saying that if they registered with the "Maritime Affairs Bureau," the ships could be expected to be returned, intending to induce cooperation and covet their property. However, the Portuguese merchants believe that each ship was legally purchased from Chinese merchants and that the property rights could not be falsely accused by the Japanese side. Therefore, they decided to continue negotiations through diplomatic channels and ignore the inducements of the puppet organization.

### Guerrilla Commander Chen Caifu From Tonghai Area Feigns Surrender, Luring and Killing Japanese Troops, Killing Over a Hundred at Feast

According to talks with Tongzhou customers, Chen Caifu, the guerrilla commander from the Tonghai area who was recently recruited by the Japanese army, has been trusted by the Japanese side after being appointed as the Tongzhou Police Chief by the Japanese side. However, Chen's surrender to the Japanese side was actually for a different purpose, as he planned to stage a shocking anti-Japanese masterpiece. It turns out that after Chen was entrusted with the important task of Tongzhou police affairs by the Japanese side, he obeyed the Japanese military authorities in everything. On the surface, he also actively engaged in recruiting guerrillas in the Tonghai area. Therefore, Chen's trust in the Japanese side increased with each passing day. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Chen suddenly captured two bandits from the countryside near Tongzhou. After confirming their guilt, Chen ordered the two to be beheaded and their heads displayed to the public. At the same time, he posted two criminal charges, falsely claiming that the two criminals were guerrillas who had not been recruited and were plotting to attack the Japanese army, etc. Chen also feigned loyalty to the Japanese side, falsely claiming that the two criminals were the most powerful in the guerrilla team and had repeatedly refused to surrender, so he tried to capture them. He originally planned to send them to the Japanese army for interrogation, but because it was inconvenient to escort them along the way, he ordered them to be beheaded, etc. After this performance, the Japanese side's belief in Chen became even stronger. Chen took advantage of this opportunity to invite Japanese military officers to a banquet at a certain place outside Tongzhou City. A total of more than 30 Japanese military officers and 60 armed Japanese soldiers arrived. Chen slaughtered pigs and sheep that night, seemingly to reward the troops, but secretly deployed more than 400 plainclothes armed guerrilla members around. After the Japanese army arrived at their destination, they saw nothing unusual, so they set up their guns and rested, waiting to eat. Unexpectedly, before the pork and mutton were brought to their mouths, a signal was given, and ambush troops came out from all directions, annihilating all the Japanese troops on the spot and capturing many weapons. After the Japanese army in the city heard the news, they mobilized a large number of reinforcements to rush to the scene, only to find the bodies of most of the Japanese soldiers, while Chen and his troops had retreated far away. After the news spread, the people in the Tongzhou area were greatly relieved. It is now heard that Chen has received an order of commendation from the highest military authorities of China, helping Chen to carry out his mission from beginning to end and kill the enemy to achieve results.

### Ministry of Finance Instruction Urges Prompt Payment of Profit-Seeking Income Tax; In Extraordinary Times, National Responsibility Should Be Expressed Through Eager Contributions

The Ministry of Finance issued Instruction No. 7636 to urge the payment of profit-seeking income tax for the 26th and 27th years. The instruction states that regarding the deadline for filing and paying profit-seeking income tax, Article 8 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the income of the first category, items A and B, shall be reported by the taxpayer to the主管征收機關 (responsible collection agency) within three months after the annual tax settlement, according to the prescribed format. In addition, Rule 26, Paragraph 10 of the Implementation Rules stipulates that the payment deadline for the first category, items A and B, shall be from March 1st to the end of May, or from August 1st to the end of October each year, depending on the annual settlement period of each industry. This payment deadline was previously clarified by the Ministry in an explicit order as the final deadline that must not be exceeded. Before this deadline, after receiving the payment notice from the competent collection agency, the taxpayer should follow the instructions and report and pay the tax and should not delay intentionally. On March 5 of the 27th year, the No. 1605 instruction was issued to all income tax offices for compliance. Now that the tax collection period for profit-seeking income tax in the 27th year has arrived again, and that important cities in the rear have been ordered to evacuate their populations, there is deep concern that businesspeople in various industries may misinterpret the regulations and intend to delay payment, which would not be a prudent way to handle tax revenue. Therefore, the previous order is re-emphasized, urging each taxpayer to be clearly informed that they must pay taxes promptly after the settlement is completed and the payment notice is received, without delay, so as not to affect treasury revenue. Additionally, they are instructed to intensify investigations, reviews, and tax collection, so that taxpayers can express their responsibility to serve the country eagerly during the war of resistance. In addition to separate orders, they are urged to comply strictly with the above-mentioned handling matters. Upon receiving this, it is hereby notified for verification, hoping that it will be communicated to the businesses of each industry so that they will report and pay income tax at the time of settlement. In this extraordinary period, they should contribute eagerly to fulfill their responsibility to serve the country.

### Large Number of Japanese Troops Arrive in Shanghai, Totaling Over 6,000; Marched from Suzhou Yesterday

Yesterday afternoon, troop movements were seen in the Hongqiao district, the largest since the end of the fighting in the Shanghai area.

### After the Death of Fengxian Gentryman Chen Bo'an, Siblings Dispute Inheritance; Concubine Ms. Li Seizes Property; Wife and Children File Criminal Suit

Chen Bo'an of Fengxian was a well-known local gentleman and merchant, and his wealth was considered the greatest in the county. In addition to real estate in his hometown, he had substantial deposits in major banks in Shanghai, and operated a pawnshop in the concession area. Chen had two wives, one being Ma Wenyun, who bore five children: Jun Gai, Jun Hui, Jun Ting, Jun E, and Jun Qu. They have all grown up and are serving in the business and academic worlds. The other wife was Ms. Li, who bore two sons: Jun Fu and Jun Tan. They are currently still in school. The "813"

Incident occurred the year before last. Fengxian, located on the coast, was subject to enemy occupation. Chen Bo'an therefore first led Ms. Li, Jun Fu, and Jun Tan, bringing with them property deeds and valuables, to seek refuge in Shanghai, lodging in a hotel. The rest of the family was scattered. Chen Bo'an, not long after arriving in Shanghai, due to old age and weakness, and unable to bear the hardship of displacement, fell ill at the hotel. In October, his son Jun E, born to Ma, arrived and saw his father's

critical condition. Fearing that the property would be difficult to verify after his death, he asked his father to invite Zhu Youqing, a relative in Shanghai, to the hotel, so that Zhu, in his capacity as a notary, could open a detailed inventory of the property evidence in the carried boxes, for future reference. However, when Jun E invited Zhu on that day, Bo'an had already been sent to Renji Hospital by Ms. Li, and died shortly after, so Zhu did not have time to handle the matter by the sickbed. Therefore, Jun E placed a seal

on all the boxes, which were still kept by Ms. Li and her son. Subsequently, Ma and her other four children, Jun Gai, etc., arrived in Shanghai and jointly inspected the items in the boxes with Ms. Li and her son, only to discover that the seal of that day had been removed and the property deeds in the boxes were all gone. Thus, a lawsuit over the inheritance arose between the Chen siblings. Because 593 Lafayette Road and 338 Avenue Joffre, where both parties resided, as well as the Baoda Pawnshop on Jin Shen Fu Road, were located in the French Concession, the case was accepted by the Second Special District Local Court.

After the first trial judgment, the losing party was dissatisfied and is still appealing to the Third High Court branch. Recently, Ma's children learned that Ms. Li's side had engaged in other acts of property seizure, and that these acts occurred in the Public Concession. Therefore, they led their four sons and one daughter and hired lawyers Gao Junxiang, Zhu Sifu, and Sha Yankai to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court against Ms. Li, her sons Jun Fu and Jun Tan, and her relatives Yang Jinglu and Yang Yaozhang (also known as Yang Shuzhen) for

criminal seizure. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing opened the court to summon and question them. The defendant's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, appeared in court and stated that Ms. Li was ill and that her two sons were young and still in school, so they could not surrender themselves at this time. He requested a postponement and, in order to clarify the contents of the case, requested that the case file be collected from the Third High Court branch for review. The court then briefly questioned the plaintiffs Chen Jun Gai, Jun E, and Jun Qu, who had appeared in court, about the types of property stored in the boxes and the reasons for not opening an inventory. The court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the 24th of this month.

### Sailing Ship "Taiping" Departed Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Expected to Arrive in San Francisco by the End of July

The Westerner couple, the Andersons, previously sailed to San Francisco, USA, non-stop, with companion Zelek Kevitani and three Chinese sailors, aboard the Ningbo-style sailing ship "Taiping." Unexpectedly, after departing Shanghai on the 7th and sailing for two days, they suddenly returned to Shanghai last Sunday. The reason for the sudden return is unknown. It is said that there was a mechanical failure. One theory is that a companion changed their mind at the last minute. It is now learned that the Anderson couple has decided to continue sailing to the United States on the original ship. It is heard that they departed Shanghai yesterday morning. If they do not encounter any accidents on the way, they can arrive at the Gold Island near San Francisco by the end of July this year to participate in the World's Fair being held there.

### Metropolitan Ballroom: Eviction Lawsuit Occurs; Hengye Company Orders Eviction, Ballroom Authorities Refute with Reason

The land at the site of the current Metropolitan Garden Ballroom at the intersection of Gordon Road and Jing'an Temple Road was originally vacant land owned by the American company Puye Real Estate. On May 7, 1935, Metropolitan signed a lease agreement with Puye Company for this vacant land to build a ballroom. At that time, it was stipulated that the monthly rent would be 700 national currency units. If someone later wanted to lease the land at a higher price, Puye Company would provide proof and notify the Metropolitan authorities. If Metropolitan wished to continue leasing, they would have to increase the rent to the amount offered by the third party. This contract was an indefinite contract. Metropolitan,

Since signing the contract, immediately constructed buildings and laid out gardens on the vacant land, spending no less than 100,000 gold units. By May 1938, the ownership of the land was transferred from Puye Real Estate Company to the British company Hengye Real Estate Company, and the lease agreement with Metropolitan was also transferred simultaneously. There were no disputes until last year when there were disagreements among the shareholders of Metropolitan, and some shareholders withdrew. Manager Jiang Yaozhang then

Recruited new shareholders to join. At this time, Hengye Company suddenly notified Metropolitan in October of last year that from January 1, 1939, the monthly rent would have to be increased to 850 yuan. Jiang Yaozhang had no objection to the rent increase, but felt that the indefinite term of the lease was inappropriate. Therefore, he immediately entrusted British lawyer Mr. Rickes to negotiate with Hengye Company Manager Smith to establish a fixed-term contract of three years. Hengye then

Proposed several conditions that Metropolitan should comply with. Hengye notified that from January 1, 1939, the rent would be increased to 850 yuan, and Metropolitan must be organized as a British Limited Company. If the market price fluctuates, use nine pence as the standard to determine rent increases or decreases. These conditions were repeatedly discussed, and Metropolitan accepted them one by one. Just as they were about to revise the contract, Hengye Company suddenly notified in writing on December 28 of last year, stating that according to the previously agreed contract, if both parties

Wished to terminate the contract, they could give notice three months in advance. Now, based on the contract, our company is limiting Metropolitan to return the leased land by March 31, 1939, and demolish the buildings on the land to restore it to its original condition. Metropolitan believed that Hengye Company was going back on its word and that there was obviously another motive. Therefore, in addition to complying with Hengye's previous notice to increase the rent to 850 yuan, they also expressed opposition to the eviction. After the deadline of March 31, Hengye immediately hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Metropolitan to recover the leased land and restore it to its original condition, and also applied for

Permission for provisional execution. Yesterday, Judge Ni Zheng'ao of the Special Court held a hearing to summon the parties. Metropolitan retained lawyers Chen Tingrui and Wu Linkun to appear in court to defend their case. Their reasoning was roughly as follows: Although the contract signed by the original and defendant parties in this case appeared to be an ordinary agreement on the surface, the actual land leased by the defendant at that time was only vacant land. Later, buildings were constructed on the land, so it was actually a superficies right under Article 834 of the Civil Code. According to the provisions of superficies rights, the contract can only be terminated if rent is owed for more than two years. The defendant has never been in arrears with any rent, even when the war broke out and the ballroom closed

to be used as a wounded soldier hospital, the rent was still paid. And recently, the plaintiff notified of a rent increase, which was also complied with. Moreover, after the plaintiff proposed the rent increase, the defendant not only agreed but also negotiated a fixed-term lease with the plaintiff. The defendant also endured and reluctantly accepted the various conditions proposed by the plaintiff. At that time, there were more than a dozen letters exchanged between the two parties. However, the plaintiff even published articles in newspapers to undermine the defendant's business, which was obviously for another motive. According to a publication in a certain tabloid, it was said to be due to the

Message that some of the shareholders who withdrew wanted to excavate the land. Combined with the plaintiff's fickle behavior, it is sufficient to prove that the plaintiff's lawsuit was instigated by a third party. In short, the defendant has not been in arrears with any rent, and has even complied with the rent increase, so it has not violated any legal or contractual provisions. As for the plaintiff's reliance on the three-month notice requirement in the contract, it should be known that this clause is a procedure for terminating the contract, not a reason for terminating the contract. If

If this condition is considered a reason for terminating the contract, then Metropolitan could just finish building the house today, and tomorrow the plaintiff could notify them to move out in three months. Wouldn't that be childish? Therefore, we should ask the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit and order them to bear the litigation costs. As for the provisional execution, the defendant is not in arrears with rent and has a deposit of 2,100 yuan, so we also ask that it be rejected together, and submit various evidences for examination. Judge Ni, after reviewing the case, declared the debate closed and scheduled a date for the judgment to be announced.

### Loan Unsuccessful: Plot by Monk of Tu Hai Temple

Kong Ci, the abbot of Fuguo Temple at 4725 Robison Road and a native of Taizhou, loves to drink. He often keeps a wine bottle in his meditation room. Before going to sleep, he must drink several cups of yellow wine. At around 6:00 PM on the 12th, Kong Ci entered the meditation room, took out a full wine bottle, and poured the yellow liquid into a cup, disregarding the different color of the wine. He drank it and

Tasted bitter. He felt very strange and puzzled. He then spat out the wine and poured the remaining wine in the bottle onto the ground elsewhere. He then went to a nearby wine shop to buy some to drink. The taste was the same. The next day, he learned from a visiting monk named Guangyu that the monk Zhaokong, a native of Taizhou in the temple, had been wanting to return home for two weeks, but his request for a loan of 80 yuan was not granted

Building resentment. He put medicine into the wine bottle in Kong Ci's meditation room, plotting to harm Kong Ci's life. So, yesterday, he reported the situation to the Putuo Road Police Station in charge, who dispatched detectives to arrest the monk Zhaokong. They found a glass tube containing

Powder under his bed. They took the person and the item to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and said that the defendant claimed at the police station that the powder was fruit salt, which would cause people to

Have diarrhea. It was not poisonous, but just a joke with the abbot monk Kong Ci. This case is requested to be postponed and the powder sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council Laboratory for testing. Then, Abbot Monk Kong Ci and Monk Guangyu testified about what happened. When questioned, the defendant's confession was hesitant. Judge Huang Risheng ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### Another Elimination of Traitors Case in Suzhou: Puppet Civil Affairs Secretary Assassinated; Shot Dead by a Strong Man While Flaunting in a Chartered Car

Another assassination occurred in Suzhou the day before yesterday. The assassinated person was Yao Zhian, secretary of the puppet "Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Provincial Government." Yao lived in Minle Lane, Bifengfang, Lindun Road in Suzhou City. At 9:30 AM on the 13th of this month, Yao was riding in a chartered car from home to the puppet "Department" to work when he reached the intersection of Lindun Road and Guanqian Street. Suddenly, a strong man jumped out from the roadside and fired at Yao. Four shots were fired at the time, two hitting Yao's chest. He immediately splattered with blood and fell from the car to his death. The assassin, seeing that his goal had been achieved, left calmly, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, the Japanese and puppet authorities in Suzhou immediately imposed martial law and searched the area, but found nothing. According to reports, Yao, also known as Ji'an, was originally a teacher at an elementary school in Suzhou. After the establishment of the puppet "Suzhou Autonomous Association," Yao, a poor and humble scholar, suddenly became a member of the "Association." After the puppet "Association" was disbanded, Yao took the current puppet position.

### Case of Shooting Xi Shitai: Dying Words of a Hero; Three People Participated in Killing Xi, the Shooter Was a Fugitive Named You

According to the "North-China Daily News," Peng Fulin (23 years old), the suspect arrested in Baolong Hospital after the assassination of Xi Shitai, secretary of the puppet "Dadao Municipal Government" "Public Security Bureau," on Tuesday morning, died of his injuries yesterday (the 13th) afternoon at 3:00 PM. It is said that as Peng was about to die, he summoned detectives to his bedside and admitted to being one of the three people who shot and wounded Chinese Constable No. 730 who was chasing him. It is said that Peng also claimed that only three people participated in the shooting, one of whom is at large. Another suspect is now being held at the Central Police Station. His name is Zhao Baisheng (transliteration), and he also admitted to being one of the terrorists, saying that he was assigned to keep watch and signal when Xi left the alley to notify the others. However, he did not carry any weapons. The person who actually killed Xi was named You Dechang (transliteration), whom he had only met a few days ago. Zhao also stated during interrogation that he did not know where the assassination order came from. Detectives from the Public Concession and the French Concession are still investigating in order to capture the person named You and obtain more detailed information about the masterminds of the terrorist act. According to the investigation so far, it seems clear that the three people involved in the shooting on Tuesday were indeed members of a group that wanted to eliminate Xi. Also, Peng Fulin was unconscious after entering the hospital, so he could not be interrogated. However, he regained consciousness for about half an hour before his death, and the detectives at his bedside were able to hear his last words. Zhao Baisheng was also at his bedside at the time. Peng denied shooting Xi, but admitted to shooting at the Chinese Constable and being one of the three terrorists.

### Former Local Bully of Fahua Town Suddenly Arrested

Wang Xinda, a native of Fahua in western Shanghai, was a "big shot" in the eastern and western towns of Fahua and had considerable potential influence. In 1927, he was arrested by the Public Concession Police on suspicion of kidnapping and sentenced to five years in prison by the former Provisional Court. After serving his term, he specialized in being a "big shot" in the Fahua area. Since the outbreak of the August 13 Incident two years ago and the westward shift of the war situation, there were rumors that a puppet organization appointed Wang as the chairman of the Fahua Maintenance Association. Wang opened a gambling den called the Dali Company Club in Fahua. On the third day of the first lunar month of this year, the guerrillas sent people to search Wang's home in Fahua East Town and confiscated a pistol. Wang was not at home at the time and was not arrested. From then on, Wang moved to 39 Haigeli, Haige Road in the French Concession for safety reasons, living in seclusion. It is now heard that at midnight on the 12th, the French Police sent detectives to arrest Wang Xinda and take him back to the police station to await investigation. The reason for his arrest is said to be related to the case where his sister, Wang Guizhen, colluded with her lover, Tao Boqing, to murder her former lover, Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Sanzi, on the 20th of last month. Whether this is true remains to be confirmed.

### Case of Murdering One's Husband: Trial Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

The Adulterous Woman's Brother Released

Pang Kaibao, a road worker from Jiangbei, had an affair with Zhang Er Guniang, the wife of Dou Youqing, a fellow townsman living in a bungalow on Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu. The adulterous couple actually took advantage of Dou Youqing's deep sleep in bed at around 1:00 AM on February 21st and hacked him several times in the temple with a sharp ax, killing him. They then carried the body to a deserted pond nearby and used a rope to tie the body around the waist, one end using a lead bucket filled with stones to sink it. After the case was discovered, the suspects were arrested, including Zhang Youfu, the brother of the runaway Zhang Er Guniang, and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng went to court to conclude the investigation. Pang Kaibao was returned to custody, and a date was set for sentencing. Zhang Youfu was found to be unrelated, and the police's request for his release was approved.

### Petty Official Embezzlement Case: Appeal Overturns Previous Confession

Mao Zhenyu, a native of Taicang, is 23 years old this year. He has been a petty official at the Tongfa Public Customs Brokerage at 78 Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession for more than seven years. His monthly salary is only seven yuan. In recent years, Mao has been forging receipts from Taikoo Company and other companies, adding hundreds of digits to deceive the brokerage's accounting department and obtain money for personal use. He also relied on this income to marry last year, spending 2,000 yuan. It was not until the beginning of last month that Xiao Zhemian, the Guangdong owner of the brokerage, discovered that he had embezzled more than 3,000 yuan. He also found 13 forged receipts and reported them to the French Police, who detained Mao and prosecuted him in the Second Special Court according to law. Mao also confessed to embezzling about 2,000 yuan. The first instance sentenced Mao to one year in prison. Mao was dissatisfied with the verdict and retained lawyer Zhang Shibeng to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, the collegial panel held a hearing. Mao's grounds for appeal overturned his previous confession, denying forging receipts and embezzling. He said that he resigned at the end of last year because his salary was low. At that time, he checked the accounts with the accounting department and found no errors. Later, he was suddenly accused of embezzlement. He was forced to confess at the police station. The court reviewed the confession and decided to postpone the hearing for further questioning after summoning witnesses. Mao was still remanded to the detention center.

### Commercial Printing House: Labor Dispute Resolved

The Workers Put Forward Three Conditions That the Capital Accepted; Work Resumed Yesterday Morning

The Swiss-owned ABC Commercial Printing House on Sichuan Road in this city has more than 100 workers. All wages are calculated on a piece-rate basis. After the August 13th Shanghai War broke out, the capital reduced the daily working hours from eight and a half hours to seven and a half hours due to sluggish business, and wages were calculated at a 10% discount. Recently, the workers, seeing that the factory's business has returned to normal and that the cost of living, clothing, food, and housing has soared, felt that it was difficult to maintain their livelihoods and made a request to the factory, but to no avail. Therefore, they all announced a strike the day before yesterday afternoon, putting forward the following conditions for improving treatment: (1) Restore working hours to eight and a half hours; (2) Wages must no longer be discounted; (3) The capital will provide additional subsidies. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, representatives such as Xu A'gen were sent to negotiate with the factory manager in person. As a result, the capital fully accepted the first two items.

### Ministry of Education Convenes a Training Discussion Meeting Minister of Education Chen Publishes Training Proposals and Passes a Motion to Implement a Tutoring System

(Special dispatch from Chongqing) From March 31st to April 1st, the Ministry of Education convened a training discussion meeting, gathering the directors of education departments from Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, and other provinces, as well as the training directors from universities across the country. The agenda was as follows: the first day, 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, speeches and training reports; 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, training reports; the second day, 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, group discussions; 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, plenary session; 7:00 PM, closing ceremony. On the first day, Minister Chen Lifu personally presided over the meeting and delivered a speech on education in our country, lasting four hours.

Chen's Speech

Chen's speech mainly stated that the biggest shortcomings of our country's people are two: one is a lack of organization, and the other is a lack of enthusiasm. Because there is no organization, everyone is selfish and self-interested, and the country presents a chaotic phenomenon. Because there is no enthusiasm, everyone is lifeless, and the country presents a dull state. To remedy these ills, the only way is "rites" and "music." Rites and music are to complete moral education. If rites and music are not practiced, morality will be lost, and rewards and punishments will not be clear. Rites are about order and solemnity, with layers of control from top to bottom, division of labor and cooperation from left to right, and neat steps. Rites are also about standardization and unification. According to this standard, school training should be strictly implemented. Music is about being lively and vigorous, the education of the seven emotions, but not being unconstrained, still having discipline, and receiving considerable adjustments in spirit. The spirit of rites is like a father, father-style education, rigid, deciding on outlines, containing the nature of should and should not. The spirit of music is like a mother, mother-style education, soft, verbose, containing why should be so and should not be so. The education in foreign churches is the education of rites and music. Without rites is like without a father, then it is an orphan; without music is like without a mother, then it is a grieving child. Our country has not practiced rites and music for a long time, and has become a nation of orphans and grieving children. Therefore, rites and music should be remedied from the root, otherwise, we are truly disloyal subjects and rebellious sons.

Chen's training proposals are: (1) One central belief: "sincerity"; (2) Five relationships: "ruler and subject, father and son, brothers"; (3) Three key points: "wisdom, benevolence, courage"; (4) Six methods: "rites, music, writing, mathematics, archery, charioteering"; (5) Eight steps: "investigation of things, extension of knowledge, sincerity of intention, rectification of the heart, cultivation of the person, regulation of the family, governing the state, pacifying the world." Then, he elaborated on the meaning of sincerity, the six arts, wisdom, benevolence, courage, and the five relationships, and the listeners were all moved. Following Chen's instruction was Vice Minister Gu Yuxiu, who explained wisdom, benevolence, and courage with unique insights. Gu said that wisdom is creation, benevolence is service, and courage is sacrifice. He cited many scientists who created and sacrificed for the benefit of the public. The inventor of the long-distance telephone died of starvation, which is the most prominent example.

After the two finished speaking, someone asked whether the school motto should be unified. Minister Chen said that the ministry had already ordered the schools, but now Chiang Kai-shek's intention is to set "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace" as the "national motto" and "rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame" as the "school motto."

Group Meetings

After the schools and departments reported on the implementation of training and the difficulties encountered, group discussions were held. They were divided into two groups, one for colleges and universities, convened by Director Wu Junsheng, with participants including Zhang Dingyi, Zhou Shang, Jing Yunjie from the Ministry of Education, and representatives from various schools such as Cha Liangzhao, Yuan Dunli, and Wang Shulin. The other group was for secondary schools, convened by Director Gu Shusen, with participants including Zhong Daozan, Dai Yingguan from the ministry, and representatives from departments and schools such as Zheng Tonghe, Zhang Zhihan, and Wang Jiesan. The proposals discussed by the two groups were the same: (1) the issue of implementing the tutoring system; (2) the issue of social service; (3) the issue of standards for assessing conduct; (4) the issue of student attitude.

Important Resolutions

The important resolutions of the plenary session were as follows: (1) How to effectively implement the tutoring system: 1. Create public opinion; 2. Pay attention to the distribution of teachers' work; 3. Stipulate simple forms; 4. Hold a entrustment ceremony. The tutoring system in secondary schools should be different from that in universities, with separate male and female tutors, and with class as the unit. Schools with more than 25 students per class should set up group tutors, and branch schools should set up branch school tutors. (2) Omitted. (3) How to implement social service and labor service: 1. Determine the scope of service, such as those related to the War of Resistance, production, education, and hygiene; 2. Determine according to local conditions and the location of the school; 3. Utilize summer and winter vacations; 4. Need supervision, etc. (4) How to stipulate the standards for assessing conduct: 1. The ministry should set standards; 2. Determine the method of criticism; 3. Should be based on physical fitness, character, scholarship, and service. At the closing ceremony, Minister Chen delivered a speech, lasting one and a half hours, and the meeting concluded successfully.

### Reading Notes on the Exhibition of Chinese Paintings of Past Dynasties (1)

— Shi Chongpeng

The exhibition of Chinese paintings of past dynasties promotes the relics of ancestors and elaborates the national culture. It is of profound significance and has a major mission. The reporter has already published an article on personal feelings in the "Chunqiu" column of this newspaper. Now I will write down the impressions of the visit for the correction of readers.

(1) Tang Zhou Fang's "Washing Infant Picture" The oldest in this painting exhibition is Zhou Fang's "Washing Infant Picture." Zhong Lang was originally good at figures and ladies, and his paintings are of divine quality. He was once ordered to paint murals in Zhangjing Temple, which were the best at the time. This painting is a two-foot horizontal scroll, painted with color on silk. There are five ladies in the picture, with beautiful eyebrows and delicate features. The folds of the clothes are like Cao Yi's coming out of the water and Wu Dai's wind. There are also five babies, either bathing, holding, lying, standing, or sitting, each with its own posture, exquisite and lively, and the charm is beautiful and lovely.

(2) Five Dynasties Guan Tong's "Heavy Rivers and叠 Mountains" Although landscape painting originated in the Northern and Southern Dynasties and flourished in the Tang Dynasty, the one who achieved great success and reached the peak was Guan Tong, a disciple of Jing in the Five Dynasties. However, except for a few pieces collected by the Palace Museum, Jing Guan's works are rarely circulated. This is an eight-foot large painting, ink and color on silk, with a majestic momentum, highlighting the vast Fan Li, and it is indeed a good construction in Chang'an. At the lower left end, there is an inscription by Ye Gongchuo, "The only Guan Tong work in the world." Ye is a master of appreciation, so it is not a false reputation.

(3) Ninth Dynasty Person's "Revealing Bowl Picture" Cao Zhongxuan and Zhou Wenju were good at Buddha statues and ghosts in the Five Dynasties. This painting may have been done by the hands of Cao and others, a three-foot horizontal scroll, painted with color on silk. There are countless gods in the landscape painting of the gods, which are meticulous and unprecedented. The blue and green landscape setting, the hills and ravines are strict, and the colors are bright and beautiful. It has not changed after more than a thousand years. It is really precious. There are inscriptions by Zhang Shen, Gao Qi, Qian Pu, and others.

(4) Five Dynasties Zhong Kui's "祉衮 Picture" Painted with color on paper, more than three feet high and less than two feet wide. In addition to Zhong Kui, there is also a lady and plum blossoms. Wu Hufan's inscription says that the brush is extremely ancient, like the Dong Yuan school.

(5) Song Shi Huichong's "Huaxi Meeting Bird Picture" Painted with color on silk, more than three feet high and one foot wide. Huichong was originally known for water birds, and this painting is even more meticulous. Wang Shimin praised it as rare and precious.

(6) Song Huizong's "Snow Parrot and Danli Picture" Among the emperors of the Song Dynasty who were good at painting, there were also Renzong, who was good at Buddha horses, Qinzong, who was good at figures, and Gaozong, who was good at landscapes, not only Huizong alone, and the most passed down is Huizong. This painting is painted with color on silk. There is a white parrot on a lychee tree in the picture. The lychees are unusually bright red, reflecting the white parrot. The brush is also strong and beautiful, which is a fine product of Huizong.

(7) Song Liu Songnian's "Fishing Music Picture" Painted with color on silk, more than three feet high and one foot wide. A large pine tree is shaded on the hillside by the water's edge. Three fishing boats intersect and gather. The peaks rise steeply, and the treetops are mossy like Fan Kuan's method. The water waves under the mountain are patterned. The fishermen are leisurely. Songnian originally belonged to the strict court style, but this painting shows vitality in the meticulousness.

### More Schools in Hong Kong

The number of schools has reached 850, and more than 3,000 Chinese teachers are registered.

The development of schools in Hong Kong has suddenly accelerated, reaching as many as 857. A total of 2,209 Chinese teachers applied to the Hong Kong Education Department for registration last year, and another 231 have been added this year. It was previously rumored that the Hong Kong Education Department would restrict the increase in the number of teachers, raise the standards for assessing teachers, and restrict the registration of teachers from the mainland to Hong Kong to avoid competition with the original teachers in Hong Kong, which would affect teachers' salaries. It is now learned that this is not true.

### School News

Dazhong Middle School Dazhong Middle School on Niuzhuang Road has recently moved to its new school building at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Hardoon Road due to the large number of students and insufficient school buildings. The location is a residential area, quiet and free from noise, and the transportation is also convenient. Moreover, the school building is a single building, and there is a wide courtyard inside the front wall, which can be used for students' extracurricular activities. The classrooms and dormitories are very spacious, and the books and instruments are placed in another room, which can be used for students' reference inside and outside the classroom. It is said that the school will expand enrollment after the summer.

A virgin's heart is bright, pure, and most beautiful. Sometimes, in her graceful ideals, there appears a wonderful family, clever children, and a happy married life... But once married, these beautiful ideals often become like fleeting dreams, disappearing, leaving behind only emptiness and sorrow! Such women probably constitute the majority in today's society.

Marriage, to put it bluntly, is a desire for comfort and joy because of feelings of loneliness in body and mind. Indeed, when a beautiful and affectionate woman marries a strong and virile man, because of the wonders of nature, he brings joy to me and also joy to you. Their love will surely be infinitely tender and sweet, giving birth to clever children, organizing a happy family. Their lives are fresh and rich; their future is bright and vast; because they are encouraged and nourished by love, and driven and promoted by healthy vitality, this is truly glorious and happy! Why is married life often filled with sorrow? According to our physiological research, it is mostly due to physical or mental defects. And these defects are mostly found in men. Therefore, when a young woman chooses a partner, she should be realistic, get rid of vanity; property, status, family background, etc., are not the most important conditions; the most important thing is physical health. Because physical health is the ironclad guarantee of marital happiness.

Why do men often have physical and mental defects? This is mostly due to early years of masturbation and nocturnal emission, or post-marital debauchery and excessive labor, which damage sexual function, causing spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, infertility, neurasthenia, etc. Then, in married life, he cannot bring joy to his wife, and in his career, he cannot strive and achieve. Therefore, how can the wife not feel disappointed and saddened! As a result, all kinds of tragedies in the family are enacted, which is also a very common occurrence! At the same time, if these diseases are not treated for a long time, they will lead to premature aging or even endanger life! The only remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, is to take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisulin," which is the most effective treatment. This agent is replicated using scientific methods from the reproductive gland hormones extracted from strong animals such as gorillas and sea dogs. Therefore, the quality is precious and the efficacy is great. After taking it, it can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves in one day and night. If you continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating and regaining youth. However, those who have nocturnal emissions must also take "Himitoshigu Jingpian" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop emissions, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect is even faster.

Beauty and Health

### The Value of Beautiful Breasts

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Aesthetic concepts have changed, no longer valuing the face but the breasts. If the breasts are shriveled due to illness, heavy makeup is in vain!

In the past, men looked at women, they only looked at the head and feet, so-called "cloud-like hair and mist-like hair are all suitable, golden lotuses captivate the heart with every step," but now men look at women, this kind of wrong concept has been completely abandoned, their two lightning-like eyes are only aimed at the woman's chest. If they see that the woman's breasts are high and undulating when she moves, showing a fully seductive and proud posture, then even if her face is ordinary, they will appreciate and cherish her as if they have discovered a treasure, praising her endlessly. Conversely, if her breasts are shriveled due to masturbation, breast binding, or menstrual irregularities, prolonged leucorrhea, or weakness after illness, resulting in impaired ovarian function, affecting metabolism, and forming a shriveled state, then even if she wears heavy makeup or has a very beautiful face, I can say with certainty that love between men and women is difficult to sustain, because the appearance of the dress is not as precious as healthy beauty. If the breasts are withered, even if the husband does not hate her, she will always feel extremely ashamed, right?!

Therefore, now smart women attach great importance to their breasts. If they are unfortunately shriveled, they will immediately take the ovarian preparation for women "Shengzhisulin" to save them, because this medicine has a peaceful nature and great efficacy. All kinds of women's hidden diseases can be cured for you in a short period of time. If you continue to take it and persevere, it will not only make the shriveled breasts become full and high, but also rejuvenate you, make your cheeks rosy, and add to your beauty.

### Nocturnal Emissions Will Ruin a Young Man's Future

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

A young man is like the sun just rising over the mountains, he should have unlimited future and brightness. In the fire of his life, there is a burning heat, but this heat must be used on a righteous and bright road. If this heat is misused, such as young people suffering from sexual depression, committing masturbation, lustful thoughts, and excessive indulgence, resulting in nocturnal emissions, then the reproductive gland fluid in the body, which dominates our health and lifespan, will be lost in large quantities, so that all kinds of diseases arise, and symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, tinnitus and blurred vision, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, and physical fatigue will follow. In terms of sexual function, because the sexual nerves lose their responsibility, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, infertility, and underdevelopment will also come one after another. Then, in married life, he will not be able to satisfy his wife, and love will be weakened, or even lead to all kinds of tragedies in the family! Young men, whose bodies are already weak, suffer more from this torment, and become prematurely aged, die young, and their future is only hell and death!

The only way to seek remedy is to take "Himitoshigu Jingpian," which can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce wet dreams, and allow for peaceful sleep, so that nocturnal emissions can be cured. If nocturnal emissions have already caused the above symptoms, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisulin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating and regaining youth. However, if patients can come to this clinic in person for diagnosis by expert doctors, and use various treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, complete cure can be guaranteed.

### Principles for a Radical Cure of Gonorrhea

Radically curing gonorrhea is not difficult. In some cases, it is even easier than treating the flu. The so-called "some cases" refers to acute leukorrhea. In acute gonorrhea, if a careful diagnosis can be made to determine the location of the gonococcus, and then treated accordingly, there is no chance of not being completely cured in five or six days, or at most seven or eight days, with an absolute guarantee. However, many doctors always think that gonorrhea in the acute stage does not distinguish between symptoms, and always uses outdated old-fashioned therapies, or takes over-the-counter medicines that are not suitable for the symptoms. This kind of carving a boat to find the sword therapy will repeatedly mislead the acute gonorrhea that could have been quickly cured, reduce the patient's original resistance, and is tantamount to opening the door to invite thieves, forcing the poison inside. If you want to quickly and radically cure gonorrhea, it is really going in the opposite direction. Therefore, those who are infected with gonorrhea for the first time must not treat their own health and happiness as a child's play and use unreasonable treatments.

To radically cure gonorrhea – in the case of acute gonorrhea – the first thing to do is to make a careful diagnosis, such as using a urethroscope to check whether the inflammation has extended to the posterior urethra, and using a cystoscope to check whether it has become cystitis, and using a super-magnification microscope to check whether there are other bacteria mixed in with the gonococcus. All of these are basic conditions for radically curing acute gonorrhea. Then inject a specially made autogenous vaccine to resist and kill gonococcus, and make it produce an immune effect. Furthermore, use the German Filtrin-Flow electrotherapy to directly transmit the bactericidal heat to the gonococcus between the lesions. According to this principle, radically curing acute gonorrhea, and following the symptoms to perform painless and agile surgery, can relieve pain on the same day, clear turbidity and eliminate inflammation on the same day. The speed and thoroughness of the radical cure are above the general muddy water therapy.

Department: Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, and painless new method of circumcision.

### The Key to the European Situation

— Mao Lie

The instability of the European situation is, of course, due to the wolfish ambitions, bared fangs, and rampant ferocity. But Chamberlain's laissez-faire attitude is the biggest reason for nurturing the disease and leaving behind problems. Because I have said long ago that wanting the greedy to know satisfaction and stop at the appropriate point is like seeking the skin of a tiger, which will never become a reality. The only way is to use force to stop its progress, or to surround it tightly, or to strike it head-on. Then it will retreat in the face of difficulty and escape with its tail between its legs.

Now Chamberlain has indeed become somewhat aware and is trying to surround it; but it is still not thorough. The crux of the problem remains, and there will eventually be a day of collapse, allowing the bacteria to wreak havoc. Why? This is also what I have repeatedly said. The European situation cannot be stable without the participation of the Soviet Union. But Chamberlain has never intended to do so. The European situation is currently a stalemate, and it will definitely be a tragedy in the future!

Yesterday's newspaper carried a speech by Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister during the European War, which further strengthened my belief. I fully agree with his observations. He believes that although the current British government is inviting small countries such as Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia to join the anti-aggression group, it will be futile without the support of the Soviet Union. Therefore, he actively advocated: "If Britain and the Soviet Union establish a military understanding, and unite the strength of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and jointly resist any dictatorial country when it launches aggression, the effect will be incalculable." However, he also said: "If Britain and France do not provide practical guarantees and declare that they will not just talk, the Soviet Union will not cooperate." Yes, the Soviet Union is not stupid. Why bother to volunteer and do something thankless? Anyway, the smog in Central Europe will never stain its red flag!

This is the crux of the European situation: the Soviet Union does not participate in any collective action. This is the crux of the crux: Britain and France never want the Soviet Union to participate, so the Soviet Union is left to close itself off and live its life in a secluded paradise.

Why do Britain and France, especially Britain, do this? Do they really not know? No, no; they know very well. But they, especially Britain, as Lloyd George said, always think that with their efforts, everything can be solved easily, and there is no need to consult the Soviet Union. In addition, as I have repeatedly pointed out, they fear the Soviet Union more than they fear Germany and Italy. Therefore, they guard against the Soviet Union more than they guard against Germany and Italy. As for why they do this, the story is long, but to put it in a nutshell, it is just that their selfishness is too heavy and their vision is too short-sighted!

Yesterday, the American "Washington Post" also had a similar comment to Lloyd George. We can take it and learn from it to mutually enlighten.

The crux of the instability of the European situation lies here, and the crux of the instability of the world lies here. I do not have any preference for the Soviet Union, but I cannot help but shout: Without the Soviet Union, what will become of the European situation! Without the Soviet Union, what will become of the world!

### Marrying Off a Daughter

— Ming Zhi

——The Story of the Old Grandmother

Since the last siege, there have been several attacks on Qingzhen. Although the captured towns cannot be garrisoned and must be abandoned, the purpose of depleting the enemy has been achieved. However, we also paid a small price. Wang Mingyuan and his group, along with other groups, sacrificed a total of 100,000 people, and 27 were injured, with varying degrees of light injuries, and lived in the most secluded places in various villages and homes.

This morning, medic Wei Bingcheng was very anxious and came to Wang Mingyuan to discuss. He said, "All the bandages and disinfectants are about to run out, but the place to get these medicines is 20 li away in Xiaozhen. There is no way to get them. What should we do?"

"Send two brothers to go. Wouldn't that be fine?" Wang Mingyuan suggested.

"But there are traces of devils everywhere between here and Xiaozhen, and they guard the canal that must be crossed even more tightly. How can we get back with those medicines on those bridges?"

Wang Mingyuan scratched his head, and suddenly seemed to realize something, happily patted his thigh and said, "I have an idea! Let's ask the old grandmother to go!"

The old grandmother was feeding pigs behind the house. When she heard Wang Mingyuan calling her, she came out. Wang Mingyuan told her the whole story, and at the end added, "It's hard for you to dress up as a beggar again."

"No!" the old grandmother immediately replied.

"What? You don't want to?"

"No," the old grandmother smiled slightly, "First, according to the old method, we have to prevent people from seeing through it; second, this time there are more things and bigger things, and we can't carry them on our bodies. We must find another way."

"Yes, yes!" Wang Mingyuan had to admit. "But then what should we do?"

"You give it to me, I have a way. But you must give me thirty yuan. I have a place to use it."

Wang Mingyuan handed her the thirty yuan without any doubt. Wei Bingcheng told her the place where the medicines were stored.

After lunch, the old grandmother and her son Ahe set off together. She changed her previous dress and wore brand new clothes and shoes, dressing up as a woman from a well-to-do family in the countryside. Ahe pushed the small cart, carrying her.

"You can have things by this time tomorrow." This was the old grandmother's parting words in the crowd's farewell.

They, mother and son, walked ten li or so and arrived at the North Bridge, which had to be crossed. Sure enough, there were several yellow-uniformed people guarding the east side of the bridge. The old grandmother got off the cart where she could see the yellow-uniformed people, and slowly led Ahe's cart towards the bridge.

In front of a yellow-uniformed person, in addition to bowing as usual, the old grandmother automatically unbuttoned her clothes a little, patted and shook them, indicating that she had nothing on her body, and Ahe spread his hands and let them check.

"Where to go?" stiff Chinese.

"To Qingzhen," the old grandmother said with a smile, her demeanor very calm, naturally giving people the power to believe her and not dare to offend her.

"What to do?"

"My daughter is getting married, so I'm going to buy some things."

"Where do you live?"

"Wangjia Village. Please come and drink wedding wine." It was a happy invitation.

The faces of the yellow-uniformed people all relaxed, and one of them waved his hand and said, "Go, go, come back early."

"I will definitely be back tomorrow morning."

They crossed the bridge and hurried to Qingzhen.

Qingzhen is very big, and within the scope of the evil forces, there is still an abnormal hustle and bustle. They used two or three hours to buy a lot of things, including two quilts, a pair of pillows, a chamber pot, a bucket, a washbasin, cooking oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and even toilet paper and soap, etc. For each item, they asked the store for an invoice, and the invoice had the seal of the "Qingzhen Autonomous Association."

As soon as they bought the things, they immediately loaded them on the cart, and in the twilight, they rushed to a small village near where Wei Bingcheng said.

When they arrived there, under the direction of the old grandmother, they invited several women and completed what she wanted to do.

Early the next morning, the old grandmother and Ahe set off back. The cart was full of things except for her seat.

On the west side of the North Bridge, they were again subjected to a search by the yellow-uniformed people. Before they could start, Ahe unloaded everything from the cart and spread it on the ground; before they could open their mouths, the old grandmother pointed to each item and told them:

"This is a quilt; this is a pillow;... this is a pot of soybean oil; this is a pot of soy sauce; this is salt;... these are soybeans, to grind tofu;... all bought in Qingzhen, to marry off my daughter." She also took out the invoice and showed it to them.

The yellow-uniformed people initially checked very seriously, but when they looked at each item, or weighed it in their hands, they felt that there was nothing suspicious, and then they gradually slackened off. At this time, the old grandmother picked up two more things and handed them to them, saying

"This is a pot of wine, to quench your thirst for a while; these are a few packs of cigarettes, to let you blow a few puffs."

When they accepted these things, there was actually a smile on their faces.

"Marrying a daughter... eating wedding wine..." they were learning with stiff tongues.

"Yes, please come to eat wedding wine," the old grandmother said with an extra smile, "in Wangjia Village, twenty li, very close."

In the wisps of smoke they blew out, Ahe re-packed everything and walked across the bridge with his mother.

"You come to eat wedding wine," the old grandmother? said to the yellow-uniformed people on the east side.

As soon as the old grandmother got on the cart, she walked very fast, and sure enough, at the time they left yesterday, they arrived home.

"What? You bought these things back?" Wang Mingyuan asked in surprise.

"Yes; I want to marry off my daughter!" As soon as she said this, she and Ahe laughed loudly.

"Marry off a daughter?" Except for their mother and son, everyone else didn't understand.

"You don't have to ask me, listen to me, you start working," the old grandmother ordered. "First, take apart the quilt."

They took it apart with seven hands and eight feet. Ah, the quilt core inside, except for a thin layer of cotton on the surface, was filled with bandages and rubber plaster in the middle. The other quilt was the same, and so were the two pillows. They understood; they could only laugh.

The old grandmother also directed them to pour the oil, wine, and other items in the pots into other utensils, and a bottle of disinfectant appeared at the bottom of the pots. There was more: under the sugar and salt, they picked out quinine pills and aspirin pills; under the soybeans, they picked out other useful medicines. And these sugar and salt, etc., were all placed in the newly bought buckets, washbasins, and even chamber pots.

"Old grandmother is really a genius!" Wei Bingcheng said, "These medicines can be used for some time."

"Which one is not useful?" Wang Mingyuan also praised and said, "Some are delicious, some are useful, and we should buy more."

"If there are more, we can't push it," Ahe also said with a smile.

Amidst the laughter, they put away everything.

At dinner, they drank the wine that they had obtained, and they were all very happy, cheering and saying:

"Old grandmother is marrying off her daughter, we are drinking, hahaha!..."

### Recover Our Homeland!

### Nostalgia and Literati

— Bao Xiaoyun

At present, almost everyone has this kind of nostalgic psychology, especially our literati.

Literati are people who can move their pens and write, and their status in the crowd is naturally "different," which is obvious. Therefore, everything they are nostalgic for is somewhat different from ordinary people.

When ordinary people often miss their hometown, they can't help but shout a few times, vent some complaints; or put on a bitter face to people, sighing for a while, and sighing for a while; and the more violent ones, can only slap the table and jump their feet, that's all. There is nothing fresher than that.

——But when it comes to our literati, it is not the same. In addition to complaining, jumping their feet, and sighing, they also have writing articles——articles with certain rules——this is something that ordinary people can't do. And it is also the best tool for nostalgia. So our literati can "boast" enough.

If someone really admires it very much, then you might as well call out a few times: "Great literati! Before the literati, there was nothing..."

Our literati are really omnipotent. When "inspiration strikes" and they think of their hometown, they wave a few strokes and write something like poetry, prose, ... There are so many patterns, it can be said that "everything is available," and they are all "perfectly exquisite"!

Sometimes our literati are happy and send their "masterpieces" to newspapers or magazines to be published, so that everyone can appreciate them.

Sometimes, maybe at the beginning of writing, they "frown," but when they finish writing the article, they will "smile happily" to avoid thinking about their hometown again. …

Too much idle talk, in order to "adapt to reality," let's pull it back and talk about current affairs.

Everyone knows: Now is the period of all-out war of resistance, so our literati's writing of nostalgic articles is also different from usual. Usually, writing some poems about "wind, flowers, snow, and moon," writing some "harmless" articles, seems to be okay;——but this is not acceptable today, so in order to cooperate with the war of resistance, no matter what kind of nostalgic article you write, it is best to drag it up to this, to show that our literati are not only nostalgic, but also nostalgic for the country!

From the above point, we can see that the spirit of our literati is indeed "advancing side by side" with the progress of the great era!

Also, what is worth mentioning and worth admiring is that the thinking of our literati seems to be very unified. Why? Because I have seen that nine out of ten articles about this kind of writing are "almost the same." Maybe the form is different sometimes, but the content is always "largely the same."

In short, nostalgia and literati have a close relationship, which no one can deny. They not only have "perfectly smooth" performance methods, but also have the power to make people "feel lingering"!

If there are idle people who, if they are happy, might as well spend some effort to compile all the articles of this kind since the war of resistance into a large series of books, like some essentials, some series, etc. I think there will definitely be business. Perhaps there is not enough capital at the time of publication, then you might as well start selling "pre-orders" and receive cash first, so that it seems that nostalgia can also make a fortune!

### Song from the Heart

— Liu You

Morning, evening—while we are alive, our hearts always emit songs, never ceasing for even the shortest time.

This song, within our hearts, is the soul's high cry, the spirit's shout!

Although the song is beautiful, it is not always the same song!

Sometimes, the piercing sound is like the sorrowful cry of birds and beasts; the sobbing whisper is like the lament of ghosts; sometimes, the earth-shaking sound is like the roar of a tiger or lion, the shocking and fervent cry is like the struggle on a battlefield!

Song, this different song, never ceases.

But this song, even in its weeping, roaring, and frenzied cries, never loses its praise of justice.

No matter when, the song in our hearts constantly shouts: "We are human, we want to enjoy human rights!"

The devil's long howl, the ghosts' screams, cannot suppress the song of justice.

Weeping, shouting, this song from the heart, sings for the survival of humanity, this is greatness.

Song, the song from the heart, can never be silent!

### Securities: Unified A Exceeds 60 Yuan; Foreign Stocks Remain Flat and Weak

The after-hours market for securities yesterday experienced a sudden and dramatic surge, with unprecedentedly good market sentiment. The A shares led the rise most strongly. Anyone with a little calculation knew that A shares were the best. It is evident from our newspaper that most people share this sentiment. Rumors circulated that certain parties had organized a bull company for A shares, but this remains to be verified. However, observing the overall trend, it appears that A shares are leading the way. As A shares rise, other types of shares follow suit. Talk of peaceful atmosphere is still just an embellishment, but the government's newly issued 60 million yuan of construction bonds, still set at 6% weekly interest and fully issued, has dispelled previous concerns about interest rate reductions. The unification of principal and interest of various government bonds is no longer in doubt. This has undeniably strengthened public confidence and provided considerable support for the new loans. Based on this observation, there may be abnormal developments in the future because the A shares have broken through the 60 yuan barrier. Buyers are constantly pushing up the price, which is indeed a good sign.

Yesterday, Tiansheng Jinwei was the strongest buyer, absorbing A shares at any time from beginning to end without any slackening. Yongkang Mao, Dadafeng, and No. 41 also took in shares successively. No. 4 and No. 13 also saw considerable absorption. Tongkang bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon, while Runli sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. Tongde sold throughout the day. Lianhe Defu, Songmao Hengfu, and retail investors all released their long positions. The market still felt a shortage. A shares suddenly surged past the 60 yuan mark in the afternoon, and others mostly followed suit. As a result, all rose, by 7 jiao to 1.5 yuan. The rise in A shares was the most prominent. The total turnover was about 2 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Stock trading: 200 shares of Hanyeping Company stock were traded at a price of 2.3 yuan.

Zhongye Company reported that investors and speculators continued to observe the situation, waiting for the European situation to ease before making decisions. Therefore, transactions were rare, but prices remained stable because the current market conditions were quite sustainable. There was renewed demand for corporate bonds, with large volumes traded. Rubber stocks remained weak, with few sellers, but if higher prices were seen, some sellers might release their holdings.

London British Far East Company stock market prices on the 13th of this month (Thursday) only saw the price of Mecca-Chun Bank continuing to shrink by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with the price at 7 pounds 17 shillings and 6 pence. There were no other changes. The trend remained sluggish, and prices saw little fluctuation. Only the public price of Chris Poole rose by half a pound, with the price at 37 pounds, while the British-German continued loan and British bond tickets continued to fall by one pound, with the price at 67 pounds. All others were unchanged. In the market, 5,000 pounds of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bond was traded, with the transaction price at 26 pounds, an increase of half a pound according to the market. For the supply of British goods, there were 2,500 pounds each of the Huguang Railway Bond German-issued printed bond tickets and winning tickets and sought-after winning tickets, for a total of 5,000 pounds. The selling price was 21 pounds each, an increase of half a pound according to the market.

### Finance: Hong Kong Firms Resume Absorption; Spot Prices Rise Slightly—Approaching the 2,070 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's spot silver after-hours market saw an initially flat and then rising situation. Although a certain silver shop acted as an agent for Hong Kong firms to absorb silver in the morning, the amount was limited, and silver shops were still actively selling, resulting in a balanced supply and demand. Therefore, the situation was quite flat, with very few changes. However, in the afternoon, Hong Kong firms' desire to buy resumed, and sellers were mostly waiting and seeing, resulting in a slight upward price movement. As a result, the price rose by 5 yuan, and trading was thin. The total volume traded in the morning and afternoon was about 400 taels. There were no changes in silver ornaments. Sea gold remained flat. Sino-British pure gold, etc., moved downstream.

Spot silver after-hours market rises by 5 yuan

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially had few supplies or demands, causing a long period without any trading. It wasn't until after 10 o'clock that a money exchange shop sold 50 taels to a silver shop, with the opening price at 2,064 yuan, with no change from the previous closing price. After the opening, a silver shop bought 100 taels from a fellow shop at the same price of 64 yuan. Then, a silver shop did 50 taels with each other, the price was still 64 yuan. Later, a gold shop bought 50 taels from a silver shop for 65 yuan. More than half an hour later, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a silver shop, the price was also 65 yuan, it was already 11 o'clock. Later, due to a greater lack of supply and demand, no transactions were seen, causing the noon closing price to remain at 65 yuan. Afternoon trading was even quieter, and the price rose slightly because a certain silver shop resumed absorbing silver on behalf of Hong Kong firms. The sellers were waiting and seeing, so the market situation became firm. After 2:30, a silver shop bought 50 taels from a gold shop, the price was 69 yuan. Soon after, another 50 taels were bought by a silver shop from a gold shop, the price was the same. After this, no transactions were seen, so the late closing price remained at 2,069 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous closing price. The full-day price difference was 5 yuan. The selling price of spot gold shops was 2,075 yuan, and the buying price was 2,065 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no transactions.

The exchange rate for ornaments has not changed

British pure gold suddenly shrinks by half a penny

A London dispatch on the 13th stated that the price of British pure gold suddenly shrunk by half a penny per ounce, falling to 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence, causing the central bank's Chinese spot buying price to also decrease to 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao.

### British and American Exchange Rates: No Change; Hong Kong Exchange Rate Softens and Then Flattens

The exchange market yesterday, although oil companies, Mobil, and major foreign firms had settlements, foreign firms such as HSBC were still willing to release funds and slightly did some inter-trading of US dollar for June, so the process was stable with few changes. As a result, there were no gains or losses and trading was still brisk. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, it was hard at the beginning, but then it softened because of the news that Hong Kong Telecom was very expensive, and eventually flattened out.

At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar remained flat in the near term, and the long term fell by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained sluggish.

The bank's morning selling price was 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16 yuan 0625 for US exchange, with no changes from the previous closing. After the opening, foreign firms and certain banks hooked up with each other to buy British exchange but because HSBC was still willing to supply continuously, there were no changes. HSBC's listing was not moved. The White Silver Equalization Tax listing also showed no increase or decrease, still levying 5.00 percent. Afterwards, foreign firms continued to buy Dutch, Belgian, and British exchange at 8 pence 25, and also hooked up with a certain bank to trade US dollar at 16 yuan 0625 for June. As a result, the process remained unchanged. At that time, the situation of the Hong Kong exchange rate was quite hard. Foreign firms were willing to sell at 56 yuan 25, but soon because it was heard that Hong Kong Telecom was very expensive, it rose by (3125) against the British and ( )625 against the US, so the sellers' willingness to supply turned weak, and those who were shorting surged, causing the situation to change to softening. Near noon, foreign firms sold Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan to foreign firms. By the time of the noon closing, the bank's selling price was the same as the morning opening.

In the aftermarket, foreign firms continued to hook up with HSBC to buy British exchange at 8 pence 25. Afterwards, oil companies, Mobil, and certain banks negotiated to trade US dollar at 16 yuan 0625. The situation was still quite sluggish. Afterwards, foreign firms also absorbed Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan from certain Dutch banks. The situation was also flat. By the time of the late closing, the bank's selling prices were 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16 yuan 0625 for US exchange. As a result, there were no gains or losses compared with the previous night's closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate also did not change.

Retail investors absorbed slightly. Transactions were sparse, and fluctuations were very narrow. The trend was slightly firm. In the afternoon, Hong Kong and Xiamen firms absorbed slightly. Gold shops and money exchange shops did not supply smoothly. The market price continued to rise.

### Yarn and Cotton: 20-Count Double Horse Yarn: Stockpilers Take Profits; Market Price Fails to Continue to Rise with Coarse and Fine Yarn

Yarn Market: Feels smooth. Although demand in the South is less than that in (omitted text), sporadic transactions are still uninterrupted. Furthermore, the Chaoshan, Hong Kong, and Yunnan regions have recently shipped a large amount of spot goods, so the recent yarn stock is not as loose as it used to be, and the market can be more stable. However, the 20-count Double Horse's rising but soft state is due to the strong consumption, but the production quantity is increasing, and the stockpilers have a strong hold on the goods. Many people are able to profit and sell when the market price rises, so the upward trend has not been actively advancing. The atmosphere in the afternoon of the previous day was exceptionally lively, and the market closed at the peak price. Judging from the past experience of the market, there was no doubt that the market would rise yesterday, but the material felt lower than the price of the previous day. Judging from this situation, the trend of the current yarn market is difficult to predict. In short, it is currently hovering in a solid state, and a new posture needs to be promoted by strong sales, which is difficult to achieve for a while. However, the buying interest in 10-count coarse yarn and 32-count and 42-count yarn is strong and rising.

Current yarn situation: Morning opening, due to rain, the gathering was later than usual, the market situation was flat and weak, the opening price fell by 1.5 yuan, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 394 yuan. The actual demand was not as large as the previous day, and the domestic households who were active in the afternoon of the previous day did not come to absorb, saying that they were waiting for the market price to fall back a bit before re-energizing. There may be some fabrication in this. However, in fact, the 20-count yarn chips are still sufficient. Slightly tired in the middle, the Double Horse price did up to 392 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, and then rebounded at the close. The opening in the afternoon turned to a tight phase, because the price was tired and few people were selling. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 394 yuan 5 fen to 5 yuan. The rising force of 42-count double-strand thread was even stronger. A total of 1,210 packages were purchased by various gangs throughout the day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse and Tiannv fell by 0.5 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 10-count group yarn was firm, but 42-count rose by 5 yuan. The factory opened 100 packages of 20-count Double Globe from Xinyu, with a price of 385 yuan. Today, 900 pieces of exported cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong, 380 pieces were transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 740 pieces were transported to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:

Yunnan 80 Shantou 180

Inland 60 Fellow Traders 530

Wenzhou 25 Quanzhou 5

Jiangxi 75 Hong Kong 185

Fuzhou 45 Tianjin 25

Statistics 1,210

The Japanese yarn market is still extremely chaotic, and the scene in the market is full of smoke. The prices quoted by brokers often differ by several yuan, which is not surprising. It is conceivable that the winnings and losses inside are huge. Yesterday's market price fell by a few yuan. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn for this month was 356.7 yuan. There is no real price opening for Shuiyueyun.

### US Agricultural Relief Fund: There is a Saying That It Will Increase to 400 Million Yuan; Lower-Grade Brazilian Cotton Rises by More Than Three Yuan Per Dan; About 500,000 Bales Have Been Imported From Outside in the Past Year

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was more active yesterday. Shorts slightly covered positions, and fellow traders also traded slightly. Although there was no development news from Washington, Agricultural Secretary Henry Wells petitioned the government, requesting that members of Congress agree with his proposal to ask the government to increase the agricultural relief fund by 400 million yuan, so that cotton and wheat export subsidies could be realized, so that when the world needs raw cotton, loan cotton can take the opportunity to be sold out. This saying has a great impact on the future of cotton prices. Yesterday, New York rose slightly by 4 or 5 pounds, Indian cotton, including predictions, rose by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 10 pounds. The exchange rate was flat. When converted into legal tender, the price of cotton was calculated as US cotton rose by 2 jiao, Indian cotton rose by 3 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 8 jiao.

Shanghai foreign cotton transactions, various factories slightly ordered Indian cotton, and Brazilian cotton transactions were also good, especially for lower-grade Brazilian cotton, because lower-grade Brazilian cotton that can spin 42 counts only sells for more than 73 yuan per dan, which is much cheaper than domestic cotton. Yesterday, a certain bank said that the difference between this lower-grade Brazilian cotton and the higher-grade cotton was too great, and they were deeply afraid that it would be difficult to buy in the future, so they sent a telegram saying that each dan would rise by more than 3 yuan. The converted cotton prices of yesterday are calculated as follows when sent to the factory.

Foreign Cotton Converted Market Price

There is still no development in the domestic cotton business. In fact, there is a shortage of goods. Although the factory has a way to identify it, there is no way to start, so the market has entered a standstill. Shenxin Factory bought 600 pieces of American-style baled cotton, aiming to take its color, which is white, bright, jade, and pure, to mix with Indian cotton for use. Other factories have no movement. Fellow traders are also helpless. The source of northern Jiangsu is blocked again, and it is withering. Only 70 packages arrived at the Tonghua wharf, and 93 pieces arrived in Beisha. Zhejiang cotton is also not allowed to be exported. There are still 20% to 30% of cotton stored in Changshu, Taicang, and other places, but bandits are very rampant in the countryside. Robberies are heard from time to time in transportation. For the sake of their capital, merchants stop moving forward. The cotton market is unimaginable in this chaotic situation. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

In addition, recently, China-England factories have successively (omitted text) the amount of coarse and fine yarn and thread that is close to 20,000 to 30,000 packages, which naturally needs to be replenished with raw cotton. Unfortunately, in this environment, where to start? Therefore, the lack of foreign cotton ordered from overseas must be supplemented to save the situation. According to a certain bank's news, recently, various parties have ordered more than 150,000 bales, each bale of Indian cotton (400 pounds), US cotton (500 pounds), and there is also a saying that from last year to the present, Chinese and foreign factories have purchased about 500,000 bales of foreign cotton, each bale is about 200 yuan in domestic currency, and the outflow of funds is about 100 million yuan.

Indian cotton is also being shipped. It is heard that the British ship Kachichi (transliteration), which will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon, has loaded 548 pieces of cotton from Mumbai, which will be unloaded at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Continue Unabated; Sales in Local Stores Are Amazing

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday the market was firm, and the selling price was up without falling. This is because there is continued demand in South China, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Fujian. The Tianjin gang on the North Road is still actively handling printed cotton cloth. The local dyeing factory also absorbs grey cloth without any slackening. Even the sales volume of the local stores is maintained at an astonishingly high level. Moreover, many of the internal and external stockpilers are buying up various stocks to be sold in autumn and winter. The Tianjin gang has also started early to order six to seven months of woolen cloth and three hundred plus boxes of velvet cloth in July, August and September. Over a thousand boxes of printed velvet have been opened for sale by the local and Sichuan gangs. The original opening price was 2 jiao 8 fen 5 li per yard, but now it has risen to 3 jiao per yard. Yesterday's market showed little fluctuation. Yihua Golden Pagoda bleached cloth was purchased by the Fujian gang for dozens of boxes, and the inventory in the hands of fellow traders is gradually scarce. The price per bolt has been raised by 1 jiao and a half. The transaction of white coarse cloth turned smoother, and the local client gang completed 300 plus packages of transactions. Stockpilers also took in more than a hundred packages. The local dyeing factory purchased and dyed grey fine twill cloth for several hundred packages. Although the Ningbo gang in eastern Zhejiang has stopped operating, the demand in southern Jiangxi, Guangfeng, and Hekou is improving. Yesterday, they continued to handle miscellaneous cotton cloth patchwork pieces for one thousand plus several hundred bolts. The Wenzhou gang only handled coarse cloth, fine cloth, and white goods for fifty to sixty packages.

Eastern Cloth

The white goods market rose slightly. Yesterday, the demand from the local dyeing industry was strong, and they purchased various brands of fine cloth and fine twill for one thousand plus pieces. The North Gang, Tianjin, and Qingdao also handled more than 200 packages of fine cloth. The selling price was raised by about 5 fen per bolt. The shouting price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth in the aftermarket must be 13 yuan, and the actual transaction price was 12 yuan 9 yuan 5 fen. Fellow traders' thoughts are particularly firm. That is, there are also many orders for colored serge and straight tribute. The current selling price of Four Gentlemen serge is 4 jiao 2 fen and a half per yard, and the mutual selling of futures is very lively.

Export

Today (omitted text) pieces of cloth and (omitted text) were transported to Shantou, 200 pieces were transported to Hong Kong, 100 pieces were transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 470 pieces were transported to Haiphong.

### Vienna Velvet Rises Sharply by More Than One Yuan

Three-day Vienna velvet, due to the weather turning hot, the actual sales were creeping, resulting in an increase in the demand from buyers, and its standard market was quite high. Looking back at last year's selling price, it has risen sharply by more than one yuan per yard. According to the fixed rate, it is in short supply. There is a shortage of old stocks, and the cost of new goods has risen sharply, so the rising tide lifts all boats. Compared with other wool fabrics, the sharp rise is even more severe. Although there are many other fabrics that have risen by more than one yuan, they are all double-width. However, this single-width three-day Vienna velvet has risen sharply by more than one yuan. If it is calculated with double-width, wouldn't it have become a soaring of more than three yuan per yard? The momentum of the rise can also be said to be great. Yesterday, the wholesale spot price of Zhen San Tian Vienna velvet was 5 yuan 8 jiao net per yard. It was only sold for 4 yuan 7 jiao and a half last year, and 26 years before the war, it usually only sold for 3 yuan 6 jiao or 7 jiao.

### Grains: Foreign Flour Shouts Higher by Five Fen; Factory Flour Sells Well and Turns Stable; Local Wheat Trading Is Quiet Again

Factory Flour: Gradually turning stable, the sales channels of customers have become active in recent days. The factories originally intended to compete with foreign flour, so they slightly accommodated the factory prices. Later, as the market price of foreign flour has been rising for several days, and the big firms holding the goods are unwilling to easily sell them, the factory prices have also tightened invisibly. The total market transaction volume of Chechuan and each brand of flour combined is five to six thousand bags. Apart from the seven or eight thousand bags of local retail sales, all were handled by the north and south gangs. The factory price of No. 2 flour is 4 yuan 4 jiao for both the local and customer parties, but the factory has already expressed an intention to shout higher.

On the 15th, 2,000 bags of flour were exported to Weihaiwei and 17,500 bags to Yantai.

Foreign Flour: Small scattered orders of foreign flour continue to arrive at the port. Since the Qingming Festival, wood customer transactions have been quite active. The major gangs, such as Yanjin and Qinhuangdao, have already handled and loaded quite a lot, mostly middle-grade brands of Citibank flour. Local customers continue to be active in the overall market, but the floating inventory on the market has gradually felt insufficient. The goods held in the hands of large firms are all intended to be sold when the price is right, so yesterday's spot and wholesale prices have all been shouted higher by 5 fen, including Bat, Double Eagle, and Golden Horse brands, totaling more than 24,000 bags, with a price of 4 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen (cleared by exchange). It is heard that old brands such as Red Sun and Dangtian are selling for 4 yuan 5 jiao and a half cleared by exchange. It is also heard that local retail sales are 4 yuan 3 jiao 8 fen, including delivery fees, delivered by spot cash. The current futures are difficult to approach, and people's hearts are quite solid. The market is unlikely to pass small for a while.

Local Wheat: Trading has become quiet again, because the newly arrived goods were sold out in an instant, the market's supply source is silent again, and the factory stomach is also in anticipation, so the market has stopped again.

### Japonica and Indica Sales Are Sluggish

Market rumor new Saigon rice will arrive

Du Japonica: Yesterday, the source for each gang arrived at the riverbank for only 7 to 8 numbers, and the wheels wrapped two thousand plus bags. The local street and stockpilers' appetite is still sluggish. However, the sellers are quite firm in their thoughts due to the continued scarcity of arrivals and continuous rainy weather, so each commodity has very few transactions. The market is barely presented as a steady situation. If the thick and thin japonica and Duyang Jianpu and Jiantuo prices have not risen or fallen much, the road to change is also astringent, and the market color also bears a tired angle.

Customer Indica: Arrivals have been continuous in recent days, and the only way out is the local street. The market is full of selling pressure, and the market is gradually lowered. At present, peddlers are diligent in transportation, and people's hearts are even softer. Yesterday, the market of Jingwu and each indica continued to be a little one or two jiao, Nanjing Indica 12 yuan eight or nine jiao, Wu Jing Indica is only 12 yuan seven or eight jiao, and two thousand packages were traded. At present, at the time when customers are arriving in droves, there is still a rumor in the market that a new batch of Saigon rice will arrive, so the rear shape is not easy to return to the station. However, the spot of Saigon has been standing for a long time, and the high-quality pagoda brand is priced at seventeen and a half yuan, and the public bureau's repurchased goods are seventeen yuan two jiao and a half yuan.

It was found that 74 bags of corn were transported from Beisha yesterday, and 32 bags of beans were also transported.

### Oil Market: Crude Soybean Oil Subject to Manipulation, Price Rises Again Yesterday by One or Two Yuan

Yesterday, the price of soybean oil rose by one yuan, and peanut oil by two yuan. 30 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were traded (detailed market prices are listed in the market price section), as well as 50 baskets of Yantai crude oil, 900 cans of canned oil, 200 cans of Qingdao canned oil, and 10 barrels of barrelled oil. 800 dan of soybean oil from the Kai Suifeng Factory and 400 pieces of Yanqi oil were opened for trading, along with 80 pieces of Lianqi oil, another 100 large baskets, and 30 pieces of Fengnian oil. Currently, there are more than 300 barrels of Dalian oil available. The current market situation appears to be outwardly tight and inwardly strained, mainly because various sales markets, such as the Han River area, are also concentrated in Shanghai for procurement. This sometimes leads to a situation where one area is prioritized over another in terms of supply. Moreover, the source is also affected by controls, resulting in an unprecedentedly high record. Although the source is nominally controlled, supplies still arrive secretly and continuously. Therefore, the balance of market tightness is entirely manipulated by others, and the market can only be at the mercy of others. Yesterday, at the close of the market, there were rumors that Japanese merchants had opened a forward oil price of 41 yuan, but this has not yet been confirmed. Currently, the spot oil price in Dalian is around 17 yuan, plus additional expenses, which results in a cost that is 20 yuan higher than the selling price in Shanghai. With such a huge profit margin created artificially, how could ambitious speculators not pay attention to it? Therefore, peanut oil also cannot escape this stage. Future potential trends and changes are indeed numerous.

Among oil products, 3,009 pieces of branch and skin oil arrived from Wenzhou yesterday, and 990 pieces of tea oil also arrived.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Opens at 1,100 Yuan, Exceeding the Previous Increase Record; Shanghai Factories Also Rise by 50 Yuan

The foreign silk market continued its upward climb yesterday. New York recent futures rose by four points, and distant futures rose by three and a half points. Spot raw silk in China and Japan each rose by three points. Total transactions for the entire city amounted to 1,480 dan, which can be described as a boom in both price and sales. Judging from this, the US market may rise again in the near future. Yesterday, the Lyon silk market saw Japanese silk rise by three francs, Shanghai silk A-grade rise by two francs, B-grade rise by one franc, and Guangdong silk remain unchanged. The Yokohama silk market saw spot prices rise by ten yuan, opening at 1,100 yuan, and distant futures rise by six yuan, with the trend remaining good.

The local silk market in Shanghai also rose accordingly yesterday. Unfortunately, foreign firms were still demanding high prices, resulting in sluggish transactions. White factory B-grade silk was sold at an opening price of 1,650 yuan yesterday, with 78% quality selling for 1,670 yuan. In the afternoon, there were also transactions at an opening price of 1,680 yuan. Most transactions were for the near term, while May and June futures seemed more stagnant. Furthermore, these prices were about 10 to 20 yuan higher than the previous day. High-grade white factory 20-22 denier silk continued to be traded yesterday, at a price of 1,800 yuan, up 50 yuan from the previous market. However, the volume of transactions was not large and limited to spot goods for this month only. Overall, the Chinese and foreign silk markets experienced a gradual rise throughout the week, culminating in a sharp surge. Moreover, the price of Yokohama silk has exceeded the record of the previous price surge. Therefore, while the Japanese and US silk markets are currently strong, looking back at previous experiences, the current high price record seems to be approaching its limit. Generally, price increases and decreases that exceed normal levels are determined by only two factors: first, a sudden change in supply and demand, and second, a sudden change in currency value. Other factors, such as speculative manipulation and creating disturbances, will inevitably lead to a market reaction. This is because of the lack of a solid foundation.

Tea imports: 104 pieces arrived from Hong Kong on the 14th, and 149 pieces arrived from Wenzhou.

### Imports and Exports: Fresh Eggs and Pottery Arriving Continuously

On the 14th, 1,600 pieces of local paper were imported from Shantou and 3,400 pieces from Wenzhou. There were also 617 pieces of tobacco leaves from Wenzhou, and 4,970 pieces of pottery from Shantou. In addition, 22 pieces of fresh eggs came from Beisha and 2,645 pieces from Wenzhou. On the 15th, 100 pieces of egg yolk and white were shipped to Hong Kong.

On the 14th, 5,130 bags of sugar were imported from Hong Kong and 920 bags from Shantou.

Transportation and Shipping Weekly

### Overview of Changxing Company (Part 1)

— Deng Bingquan

Changxing Company (Canadian Pacific Steamship & Railways) has long been a leader in Pacific shipping. The company's General Manager, Mr. H.B. Beaumont, is capable and accomplished, making this great enterprise a reality and is deeply admired by people around the world. I once met Mr. Beaumont during his travels in the Far East and deeply admire him. Recently, I saw an article written by Mr. Beaumont himself, which I have translated as follows:

Changxing Company's trans-Pacific services began in 1891. Currently, the ships on this route include the Empress of Japan, with a total weight of 26,000 tons, the Empress of Canada, with a total weight of 21,500 tons, the Empress of Russia, with a total weight of 16,800 tons, and the Empress of Asia, with a total weight of 16,900 tons. Every two weeks, one ship sails between Vancouver, Victoria, and various ports in the East.

The Empress of Japan and the Empress of Canada follow the route from Vancouver, via Victoria, Honolulu, Yokohama, Kobe, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, before returning to England. The Empress of Russia and the Empress of Asia sail from Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, Shanghai, Hong Kong, to Manila, before returning to England. The distance from Vancouver to Manila via Honolulu is 8,458 miles, requiring 21 days of sailing.

Changxing Company's ships crossing the Pacific dominate passenger traffic between Seattle, the Pacific coast northwest of Vancouver, and Victoria, far surpassing other competing ships traveling between these ports. In addition to these strong transportation positions, the following points can prove that Changxing Company's Pacific services are indeed the best: (1) The Empress of Japan holds all the fastest trans-Pacific records, (2) The Empress of Russia and the Empress of Asia are the fastest ships sailing directly between the Pacific coast and Japan.

Since December 1929, Changxing Company's Empress-class ships crossing the Pacific began calling at Honolulu. This is an important change in the company's Pacific business, increasing traffic between Vancouver and Honolulu, as well as between Honolulu and the East. Statistics confirm that calling at Honolulu was a strong factor in Changxing Company's revenue growth during the recent years of economic downturn.

Since 1893, Changxing Company's ships began connecting with the South Sea Islands, New Zealand, and Australia. The first ship to operate on this line was the Miowera, with a total weight of 3,393 tons, sailing from Vancouver to Sydney, Australia, via Victoria, Honolulu, and Suva. Subsequently, the tonnage of ships changed, but the business on this line, continuing to Auckland, New Zealand, has not changed to this day. In 1931, the Niagara, with a total weight of 13,415 tons, and in 1925, the Aorangi, with a total weight of 17,491 tons, joined this line of navigation. No additions have been made since. Now, it sails once every four weeks. The distance from Vancouver to Sydney is 7,639 miles, requiring 23 days of sailing.

In Canada and the United States, Changxing Company entrusts the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as its transportation agent. In Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia, it entrusts the Union Steam Ship Company as its transportation agent. However, in the East, including Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, it has its own offices, with Hong Kong overseeing a large area of passenger shipping in the East, including Japan, Korea, Manchuria, China, the Philippine Islands, the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, French Indochina, Siam, the Federated Malay States, Burma, Ceylon, and India. In areas south of Hong Kong, it does not have its own offices, but has agents. When normality is restored, it may set up its own offices in one of the main centers of India or Singapore.

### Detailed Records of Inland Highways

— Jing Xun

Since the outbreak of the war, the construction of highways in inland China has been progressing rapidly. International highways include the Yunnan-Burma-Ceylon Highway, the scale of which is truly astonishing. In the southwestern and northwestern provinces, the density of highways is also commonly seen by the Chinese people. In other coastal provinces, such as Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Zhejiang, highway construction is also developing rapidly day by day. Since inland transportation is entirely dependent on highways, the general public is still largely unfamiliar with the experience of traveling on highways. The purpose of writing this article is simply to describe the detailed conditions of various inland highways, such as mileage, fares, and accommodation along the way, in order to facilitate travel. Before writing the main text, I would like to provide a few points to note when traveling on highways for reference:

When traveling to the interior, the less luggage you carry, the better, but it is virtually inevitable that travelers carry luggage. To avoid trouble on the journey, it is best to carry as little as possible. The regulations of inland highway authorities regarding luggage carried by passengers are generally uniform. Each person is allowed to carry a free baggage allowance of 20 kilograms. For baggage exceeding the free allowance, the charge is 4.6 to 5 cents per kilometer per 5 kilograms. If there is too much baggage, the baggage fee can be quite astonishing, and highway authorities often refuse to allow passengers with excessive baggage to board. At that time, it will be difficult to advance or retreat, so it is best to plan in advance. Furthermore, luggage and passengers are transported separately on highway buses. At the back of each bus, a section is set aside in a concave shape, which will be used to store luggage; therefore, before departure, in addition to larger luggage (mostly trunks, bedding, etc.), a small handbag or rattan bag is indispensable. It is advisable for the bag to be 24 inches long and 18 inches wide, with some daily necessities placed inside, which can be easily opened and used frequently without having to open the large luggage. The seats on highway buses generally number eighteen per vehicle, with the seat next to the driver being the most comfortable. If you sit in the rear of the bus, you are likely to suffer from bumps. The seats in the car are so crowded that once the bus departs, passengers cannot move. Therefore, a mouthwash cup and towel should be kept handy for spitting or vomiting due to motion sickness. Other items such as flashlights, water bottles, and medicines are all essential for travel. At the same time, an identity certificate is very important when traveling in the interior, because it is necessary to undergo inspection when entering the provincial borders of a certain province, and having that thing can facilitate a lot. The situation of each highway is described below:

(A) Southwest Highways The southwest provinces, including Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang, are at the core, with Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan as the outer circle. In addition to railways such as the Xiang-Gui, Yue-Han, Xiang-Qian, and Xu-Kun, there are four major trunk roads: from Chongqing in Sichuan in the north, via Guiyang, to Kunming in the west, and to Liuzhou in the south to reach Guilin. From these trunk roads, you can transfer to many branch roads in each province, and the scale of transportation is quite large.

(II) Kunming to Guiyang Kunming is more than 1,900 meters above sea level, with a mild climate. The busier streets are Zhengyi Road and Jinbi Road. The Kunming Business Hotel established by the China Travel Service has excellent facilities. Other lesser hotels include Deyichun, Xinsheng, and Changxin. Prices are approximately 1.2 yuan per day for a single room and 2.4 yuan for a double room. The Youth Hostel seems to be the most suitable, but it does not often have vacant rooms. From Kunming to Guiyang, the distance is 662 kilometers, and it takes three days to reach Guiyang by highway bus. On the first day, depart from Kunming to Pingyi. This distance is 237 kilometers, and the journey takes about eight hours. Lunch is taken in Qujing, and the night is spent in Pingyi; Pingyi has a special reception center of the China Travel Service, Pingyi Hotel, which costs only 7 jiao for one night and two meals. Pingyi is the last inspection point in Yunnan. On the second day, depart from Pingyi to An'nan. This distance is 183 kilometers, and it is necessary to pass through the "Twenty-Four Zigzags," which is quite dangerous. The so-called "Twenty-Four Zigzags" means that the bus climbs a high mountain, opening upwards in a "zigzag" pattern, a total of twenty-four times in a row. Therefore, it takes nine and a half hours for the bus to reach An'nan. Lunch is taken in Pan County, and the night is spent in An'nan. An'nan has a reception center of the China Travel Service, with single rooms costing 1.5 yuan, double rooms costing 2 yuan, berths costing 7 jiao, and extra beds costing 5 jiao. The cost per meal is 5 jiao. On the third day, depart from An'nan to Guiyang. This distance is 242 kilometers, and the journey takes about eight hours. Lunch is taken in Anshun. It is necessary to pass through Huangguoshu, the location of the world-famous waterfall, which is very spectacular. Although Guiyang is on flat ground, it is surrounded by mountains, so it is actually still a valley. The city is not as prosperous as Kunming, and prices are very expensive. The hotel has a reception center entrusted by the Guizhou Provincial Government to the China Travel Service, with prices of 2 yuan per room. The cost per meal is 5 jiao. Other hotels include the Guizhou Hotel, but the facilities are very simple. From Kunming to Guiyang, the free baggage allowance per person is 20 kilograms. The charge for excess baggage is 1.986 yuan per 5 kilograms. The itinerary from Guiyang to Kunming is the opposite. (To be continued)

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Transportation Still Convenient

— Xing

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is an important route into the interior. Since the fall of Nanchang, the road was suddenly interrupted, but it can still be operated in sections as usual. The eastern section can reach Guixi, Jiangxi, more than 300 kilometers away from Jinhua. The train schedule is not fixed. The fare for the third class is 5.5 yuan, and the second class is double that. The first class is double again. This journey takes about ten hours. After arriving in Guixi, you can find a way to take the highway to Ji'an. (The situation of this highway will be described in detail after accurate investigation). The Jiangxi Provincial Highway Bureau has a bus departing from Ji'an to Jiehualong every day, which can be reached on the same day, with a fare of 8.69 yuan. From Jiehualong, you can transfer to a Hunan provincial highway bus directly to Hengyang, with a fare of 11.65 yuan. Staying overnight in Chaling is quite convenient. As for the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, trains can run from Yichun to Zhuzhou, taking about six hours, with a third-class fare of 3.65 yuan. From Zhuzhou, you can take the Yue-Han Railway to Hengyang, which is only 137 kilometers away, taking about six hours, with a third-class fare of 1.75 yuan. The train schedule for the Hengyang-Guilin section of the Xiang-Gui Railway from Hengyang to Guilin remains unchanged for the time being. It is also quite convenient to transfer to the interior from here.

### Chongqing-Chengdu Aviation

— Jing

The air route between (Chongqing) and Chengdu is 280 kilometers. China National Aviation Corporation planes fly daily round trips. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, the plane takes off from Chongqing at 8:00 a.m. and arrives in Chengdu at 9:10 a.m. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, it takes off at 2:30 p.m. and arrives at 4:30 p.m. The plane flies back to Chongqing from Chengdu at 12:00 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, arriving at 2:00 p.m. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it takes off at 9:25 a.m. and arrives at 10:35 a.m. Eurasia Aviation Corporation planes depart every Wednesday and Friday at 12:40 p.m. and arrive in Chengdu at 2:05 p.m. The return flight from Chengdu to Chongqing takes off at 2:35 p.m. on the same day and arrives in Chongqing at 4:00 p.m. The fares for the above two companies are uniformly 105 yuan.

### Reliable Proof of the Effectiveness of Bosch Spark Plugs

According to a reliable survey, Bosch spark plugs were equipped in the cars that won the championship and created records in 159 international car races held in 1938 and 17 world speed records. Bosch spark plugs have been known for their economy, durability, and reliability for many years. The above survey is another solid proof of its reliability. Bosch spark plugs are managed by Jebsen & Co., Ltd. in this city. It is said that the company has shipped a large batch of new products, and the price is quite reasonable. All automotive parts stores in this city sell them.

### Travel Inquiries

Meng Mujiao, Shen Ming, Cheng Jinlong, Chen Yan, and others asked about the traffic situation from Shanghai to North China:

Answer: (1) Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships sail from Shanghai to Tianjin every Tuesday and Saturday, taking three days to reach. Taikoo Company's ticket prices are 54 yuan for cabins, 30 yuan for berths, and 22 yuan for steerage. Jardine Matheson's ticket prices are 54 yuan for official cabins, 42 yuan for cabins, and 22 yuan for steerage. A smallpox vaccination certificate is required for this ticket. (2) The ships of the above two companies dock at Tanggu Wharf after arriving in Tianjin. Passengers, except those traveling in the "Da Lai" inter-cabin area who have small ferries to Tianjin, must take the train to Tianjin, with fares of 1.25 yuan for third class and double for second class. (3) There are no procedures for leaving Shanghai and going to Tianjin. Books can be carried, and expenses on board can be paid in domestic currency. (4) You can take the train from Tianjin to Beijing. The third-class fare is 2.4 yuan. If you take the train directly from Tanggu to Beijing, the fare is 3.1 yuan. (5) You can take a bus from Beijing to Tongxian, with a fare of 7.25 yuan, which takes about six hours.

Wu Dili, Hu Fanzhong, Meng Meisun, and Tan Zhesheng asked about the traffic situation from Shanghai to Chongqing and Chengdu:

Answer: (1) The minimum travel cost from Shanghai to Chongqing via Vietnam is about 139 yuan. The cost of food and lodging along the way, calculated at the lowest rate, is about 70 yuan per person. (2) The highway bus fare from Chongqing to Chengdu is 21.6 yuan. (3) It is faster to apply for a passport in Hong Kong. If you want to entrust the China Travel Service in Shanghai to apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing, it will take about a month. As for the identity certificate, it must be issued by the organization you work for. (4) The highway between Kunming and Xufu only transports goods, and there are no buses running. (5) The exchange rate between remittances from the interior to Shanghai is about 200 yuan per thousand. The exchange rate between Vietnamese currency and domestic currency is 1.70. (6) The smallpox certificate of the Shanghai Municipal Council can be used in the interior.

Yu Boyun, Zhang Ruxin, Chen Liangjie, Shen Jinbiao, Yang Liangcheng, and others asked about going to the interior without detouring through Vietnam:

Answer: (1) You can take a ship from Shanghai to Shantou, with a minimum fare of 16 yuan. After arriving in Shantou, take the train to Chaozhou, with a fare of 7 jiao for third class. Then, take the highway through Yuning, Longnan, and arrive in Qujiang (i.e., Shaozhou), which takes about three days for the entire journey. The travel cost is about 20 yuan, but it is said that there is a severe shortage of highway buses, and it is impossible to know whether there are buses running daily. After arriving in Qujiang, you can take the Yue-Han Railway train to Hengyang, with a third-class fare of 3.95 yuan, and then take the Xiang-Gui Railway to Guilin to transfer to Guiyang, Chongqing, and other places. If you want to go to Lian County in Guangdong, you can transfer from Shaozhou by highway (fare details not available). If you take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway train from Jinhua to Guixi, Jiangxi (third-class fare is 5.5 yuan), and then take the highway from Guixi via Ji'an to Hengyang (train schedule and fare details not available), you can also transfer to the interior. Neither of the above two routes has been fully confirmed. We will report again after accurate investigation.

Zhou Handan, Yu Chi, Ji Zaiming, Li Ping, and Lin Xuanqing asked about going to the interior via Vietnam:

Answer: (1) There are direct ships from Shanghai to Fangcheng, with a minimum fare of 37 yuan per person. (2) All expenses after arriving in Haiphong are paid in Vietnamese currency. This Vietnamese currency can be exchanged at the Qian Zhuang on Sichuan Road in this city, with each Vietnamese currency worth about 1.7 yuan in domestic currency. (3) There is no physical examination when landing in Haiphong. Trachoma is not a problem. Although there is no difficulty in carrying daily books, it is best to handle them in Hong Kong, which is faster. If you do not have a guarantor but have a supporting document from the institution, you can entrust the China Travel Service in Hong Kong to handle it. The company may be able to find a way. If you entrust the China Travel Service in Shanghai to send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing to apply, it will take one month to receive it, with a fee of 8 yuan.

### Xi'an to Lanzhou

— Bao Cheng

Considering the Northwest Highway, there are seven lines in total: Sichuan-Shaanxi, Xi'an-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Qin, Lanzhou-Xing, Gansu-Qinghai, Xi-Jing, and Han-Bai. The main lines should be the Xi'an-Lanzhou and Sichuan-Shaanxi lines. The Sichuan-Shaanxi line runs from Chengdu, Sichuan, directly to Xi'an, Shaanxi, with a total length of more than 800 kilometers, taking four days, and is an important route connecting the west, south, and north. The Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway is the only trunk road in the northwest, starting from Xi'an, Shaanxi, passing through Xianyang, Liquan, Bin County, Jingchuan, Pingliang, Longde, Jieshipu, Huajialing, Dingxi, and other places, reaching Lanzhou, Gansu, with a total length of about 700 kilometers, taking about four days. The scenery along the way is magnificent and different from the situation in the southwest. This road is currently under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications. Since its opening to traffic, passengers have found it convenient. Since last year, the Highway Administration has agreed with the China Travel Service to handle food and lodging stations and passenger and freight transportation along the way. The reception centers that have been established are in Bin County, Pingliang, Huajialing, and Lanzhou. In the future, it will be improved depending on the situation of the passengers. The Northwest Highway Bureau has revised the passenger ticket prices from March 1st, which are calculated at 4.5 cents per passenger per kilometer. Starting from Xi'an, stay in Bin County on the first day, Pingliang on the second day, Huajialing on the third day, and Lanzhou on the fourth day. However, recently, vehicles have often been lacking, so the train schedule cannot be accurate, which leads to the failure to stop at the prescribed places for food and lodging along the way, which is its shortcoming. It is said that the Northwest Highway Bureau is currently striving to develop, and in the future, it will grasp the hub of northwest transportation, connecting Gansu with the outside world. The mission of transportation is important, and the future should not be ignored.

### Pengcheng No. 60 Car and Delivery Truck

### How Can Prostitutes and Politicians Compare to Elementary School Students?

— Ren Yong

A few days ago, various newspapers in this city published Mr. Wu Jingheng's eloquent and critical article. Mr. Wu's articles are typically lively and touching, and this time, he was righteously and sternly criticizing a prostitute-politician, making it even more moving.

In the middle of this article, Mr. Wu repeatedly said to the traitor Wang: "Even elementary school students know this!" or "Even elementary school students understand this!" The implication was: "How can you (Wang) be worse than an elementary school student?"

Indeed, Wang Jingwei, who once sang passionately, "Taking up the knife for a swift death, not failing my youthful head," has now become so muddled. No wonder Wu Zhi Lao had to say, "How can you be worse than an elementary school student?"

But the reality is before our eyes: the Wang Jingwei of today cannot compare to elementary school students. We might as well cite examples as evidence. I remember a long time ago, a news story reported that some × army had captured one of our young compatriots. They wanted him to write the four characters "Long live the Imperial Army," and at the same time, someone was taking pictures of this scene with a camera. Who knew that this great little hero, without panic, picked up a pen and wrote a line of large characters: "Down with ×× Imperialism!" Then, the butcher's sharp knife pierced the little warrior's burning chest, and he died unyieldingly for his country. Although this was only eight characters, it was actually better than Wen Tianxiang's magnificent thirty-rhyme "Song of Righteous Spirit." This was naturally an elementary school student; how could Wang Jingwei compare to even a ten-thousandth of him!

We once saw another great news story reported in the newspaper: In the northern district of this city, there was a certain elementary school near a certain puppet organization. One day, a group of shameless people went to visit. In one classroom, all the elementary school students stood up and shouted at this group of shameless people: "Down with the traitors!" "Down with ××!" Although this elementary school could no longer continue because of this and was moved away overnight, stopping operations, the scene was truly magnificent. Dozens of little voices indeed frightened the running dogs and terrified the enemy! How could Wang Jingwei compare to even a ten-thousandth of this!

The mad pressure of cannons and sharp knives has tempered our elementary school students to be no different from adult warriors. They already understand very well: who are our enemies, and who are the shameless running dogs? But Wang Jingwei, who closes his eyes today, I dare say he certainly doesn't understand this. So, how can he compare to our group of clear-minded, loyal, and brave elementary school students?

Therefore, while everyone reads Mr. Wu Jingheng's great work and curses the shameless prostitute-politicians, we also hope that everyone will not look down upon our elementary school students. We must learn, learn from this group of brave and great elementary school students!

### Regarding "The First and the Last"

— Wu Ren Zhi

—Confessions After Directing—

The performance of "The First and the Last" on the experimental week carries some research posture of drama itself. Of course, so-called the research of drama itself, is definitely not to be separated from times, society, and life, but just to discuss drama skill. As "no life, no drama" is true, we might as well say: no times, no society, no drama. This is the essence of drama. While doing the research of drama itself, we will never forget its essence. This time I'm very honoured, the organizing committee gave me "The First and the Last" to direct, I should write some report. But, it is ashamed, not polite, truthfully, rather than provide research material, I would rather write some confession, to supply some materials for criticism. Isn't it? It seems more appropriate this way.

My understanding of the main point of the play: "The First and the Last," the author is educating us, making us understand the essence of the times, the essence of social low law. He raised an example here: the law is protecting the money of corpse, but not sympathizing the thief (an old man) "who committed the crime for starving". Zhonghua said: "let me be as stone hearted as brother Borong… let's just forget everything ourselves… this is the world of brother." And how about his brother Borong? He repeatedly said to Wang Xiaomei: "I will plan with Zhonghua first, then I will plan with you." Of course, the relationship between people has the difference of kinship. Here, it is shown that the law is just that. Suberna said well: "you don't see law as natural as the cold of weather" "if you don't participate, they will divide your benefit, nothing left. Because they have to take care of themselves." However, Zhonghua pulled Xiaomei along to die after all. He said "we are not born to live in this world. Weak, no intention, it's better to die than to live." This is author's cleverness, he knows nobody wants to die like that. Galsworthy is educating us!

Based on the starting point of above statement, my understanding of the characters in the drama is as follows: Borong is a certain type of ruler. And Zhonghua is his most suitable opponent - the ruled. Wang Xiaomei here, although the play is important, is just a tragic contrast.

"The First and the Last" is a one-act three-scene two-scene play. Each scene is closed, and the middle of the third scene has to be curtained once (now replaced by "dark change"). It is a small three-act play in form, but there are only three characters. Directing this play is tasty enough. But it is also really difficult. In the first scene, there are only two people throughout, and there is no up and down scene, and the performance area is subject to the limitation of the light field. What I worry about most here is: whether the adjustment of the actors' positions is appropriate; whether the air can be not relaxed all the time. In the second and third scenes, what I worry about most is: whether the stage surface is appropriately viewed, the bed and door should be placed in a prominent position, and the window should be suitable for taking light; whether the mood is tight enough; whether the lighting and effects are matched, because it is not entirely according to the control of the original script. These, what I worry about most, are not what I feel satisfied with, and also what I hope to correct with high levels. We have a feeling for Dao Wei, that is, it is good, although good will not be absolute; but if it is not good, it will fail terribly, as if this play does not allow staying in a flat state. Therefore, good is necessary, and failure is my fault that cannot be escaped.

### Blood Splatters in a Brothel

— Yan Hua

“While New York Sleeps”

A 20th Century Fox Production, Showing at Cathay Theatre

"Blood Splatters in a Brothel," in terms of style, follows the new detective comedy line of "The Thin Man" and "Phantom Killer." Therefore, the entire film consistently showcases the inherent characteristics of comedy, allowing the audience to experience the flavor of witty humor amidst suffocating tension. The screenwriter is not only very successful in this regard, but also the director in terms of atmosphere, emotion, and sound effects has achieved superior accomplishments. Therefore, although there are no dazzling stars in the entire film, we truly hold "Blood Splatters in a Brothel" in high regard.

The content of this script is no different from general American detective films. It still writes about how gangsters, thugs, and lawless people in American nightclubs commit robberies and assassinations, and finally, the case is solved, and the criminals are brought to justice.

In terms of violent exposure, this kind of film seems to be slightly better than the old tunes that general writers specialize in writing about deviant love and erotica, because at least they point out that there is such human nature existing in such a society. However, the writers' vision only extends this far. They have no time to further point out how many new young people have fallen into this dark and illegal circle in such an environment. We should thoroughly eradicate this unfortunate phenomenon (it's not just a matter of shooting them to death in general G-MAN films). We must find the basis for the existence of such human nature and the factors that make them active in this society, and then we can educate them very educationally and eliminate their tendency to grow vigorously in this money-oriented society.

In terms of writing methods, "Blood Splatters in a Brothel" focuses on the capable news reporter. Like "Phantom Killer" and other films, it emphasizes the high strength of these news reporters' ability to interview and investigate, so that cases that even the police detective shrink away from, through his sharp and alert investigation, the whole case is cleared up. In the middle of this, a small love interlude is also inserted, but the writer of this film does not seem to have fallen into the old set. That is, after the news reporter spent a lot of effort to rescue a singer who was involved in a major suspect (he regarded her as a love object), he fully wanted to be engaged to her, but she left with her changed man, and also said some words to him that she would never forget him. This kind of silent and novel ending seems to have more aftertaste than the "happy ending" of general films.

The writer is extremely successful in grasping the characters' personalities. Writing Zuo Yi's joyful protection, as Zhu Di's false shooting as a result of really being killed, the front and back echoes are very powerful: writing Zuo Yi's assistant Neilson is sinister and silent, until the end he jumped out and claimed to be the murderer, all are extremely concise.

The director's emphasis on creating jokes is indeed very successful, and even the two most important scenes are also calm and superior, such as (1) The scene of Zhu Di's false killing of Zuo Yi, the high singing and revelry of the outside dance hall, the sound of bursting balloons falling from the air, the young Barney (i.e., the news reporter) just walked into the door, inside a gunshot sounded, pushing the door, Zhu Di with a gun in hand, Zuo had fallen to the ground, but secretly opened one eye to peep and smile; (2) When solving the case: everyone is checking the stock, Barney brought a photography reporter in, pointing a gun at everyone, satirical shadow, the photography reporter retreated, himself took out the gun and said the killing process, Zuo Yi's lover shot Ni in the back, Ni fell to the ground,... The detective leader hurriedly pushed the door in. The application of these two sound effects.

The male lead, Magal Lun, who plays the news reporter, is not bad, and the female lead, Jean Rogers, is also a new star, and both are very capable of acting.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianmei

Episode 8: Is It Illusion or Reality? Playing a Role. Should I Proceed or Stop? Burial Grounds Everywhere.

How is America changing its style? Because the world is gradually becoming more practical, it is no longer solely using eroticism and luxury as a means to guide the audience. Those women's legs, after looking at them, make people tired of looking. Which young woman doesn't have two legs? Whose young woman's legs aren't smooth and shiny? Looking at these legs, can it really satisfy the audience's lustful eyes? Singing and dancing in musical films is fine to watch occasionally, but if you watch them often, it's just changing the soup without changing the ingredients, always these few tricks, and it doesn't feel meaningful. Therefore, Hollywood has recently been gradually reducing films that sell female stars' bodies and movies that make people increase their sensuality. Comic films, of course, are still popular, but comedy needs to have a deep meaning, a meaningful comedy, not a meaningless comedy. As for our Chinese film industry? In the new undertaking, film is also very developed. Under the National Propaganda Committee of the Central Government, there is a Film Bureau, and in addition, various cultural institutions often have film groups. There are many other private film companies. Generally, North China is in Beijing, Central China is in Shanghai, and South China is in Guangzhou, all of which are major production bases for films. But a government agency examines everything, not allowing for shoddy manufacturing, and instead vigorously promotes films about science. I will now talk about the films shown in the East China University's theater. Whether they are foreign or domestic, most are science-related. Some are free, specifically shown to teachers and students. Others require payment because there are expenses associated with the source of these films, so a small ticket price must be charged. If there is any surplus after expenses, it will be used for public welfare in the school. Not only films are like this, but also plays, often for the sake of public welfare expenses, a small ticket price can be charged. But this one or two times a year, or the public performance on commemorative days, is the trial performance of the Drama Research Association of their student union, which has never charged ticket fees. What is performed? Are also their own scripts, directed by themselves, and have never been performed elsewhere. However, after those scripts are performed by them, they also spread throughout the country. Many other drama troupes, with the permission of East China University, perform their scripts. Approximately every year, East China University must have two or three scripts that are popular at home and abroad, known as the East China School scripts. This time, the script being performed is called "Traces of Shanghai on the Xiang River," which is a tragedy in five acts. It was written by a professor in the College of Liberal Arts of East China University, and selected several students with theatrical talent to rehearse for a month, and continued to test it today.

### Radio Musings

— (Ni Qiuping)

I feel tired whenever I turn on the radio. A continuous stream of advertisements, either saying they are hiring specialist technicians, or they are manufactured using science. No matter what it is, if it can be eaten, they always say it has vitamins. Time is limited, so the person reporting it reads it out like reciting a book. At the same time, the noisy sounds from the broadcast room are also broadcast out. This is not heard on foreign radio stations; it used to be stricter on the Central Radio Station. I used to often participate in amateur opera performances. Now, it often happens that you get there and it's incredibly crowded; then after a while, no one is singing anymore. This kind of broadcasting situation is too chaotic. I think there should be regulations on the timing. Regarding the broadcast of operas, they should also broadcast the full versions. Don't just sing a section of "Chasing Han Xin" or four lines from "Fenhe Bay," like playing a record. The other day's broadcast was for donating to refugees, everyone wasn't listening to the opera for the opera itself, but for disaster relief. It seems like it could have been more enthusiastic. For ordinary advertisement-style broadcasts, there is definitely no problem if no opera is broadcast.

I used to write some small reviews of storytelling songs in this publication. Now, I might as well say a few more things: Every day at 5:40 PM, Daya Radio has a segment of Wei Yuqing's "Pearl Pagoda," which is a solo performance. I haven't listened to it in a long time. It seems like it could be changed for something fresh. Compared to listening to Yan Xueting sing or Zhao Jiaqiu's Peking Opera, there is truly a world of difference. At 12:10 PM at noon, Yu Xiaoxia's "Jade Dragonfly" on Eastern Radio is still good to listen to, and her narration is better than Zhou Yuquan and others.

The French radio station at 1400 kHz has very good music records. I can't remember the time. I like to listen to violin solos the most, followed by piano solos, those are things that we can't hear at dance halls. If you love Western music, then please try it out.

### Xian Ni Society Continues at Xian Yue

— Yu Gong

Xian Ni Society's performance at Xian Yue concluded on the 13th. This newspaper has previously reported that it signed a contract with the Great China Theater, and so on. But news has come that there have been changes, and it will continue to perform at Xian Yue. The circumstances are noted below.

The front stage authority of Xian Yue is a female, named Cheng Ba Mei. Xian Ni Society's performances at Xian Yue are only two hours a day, and the profits are split between the front and back stages. The same is true for Wang Jia Ban's dramas. After Xian Ni Society's term expired and it stopped performing, Wang Junda, the host of Wang Jia Ban, also terminated his contract with the front stage of Xian Yue due to excessive losses in the past two months, and will stop performing on the 17th. The Xian Yue authorities, having lost both Xian Ni Society and Wang Jia Ban, had no other entertainment to fill the slot for a time. Therefore, they earnestly retained Xian Ni Society, and changed the profit-splitting arrangement to a package deal. The host of Xian Ni Society, seeing that the guests and hosts had been very harmonious since performing at Xian Yue, and having been retained, immediately agreed. It was decided that performances would begin on the 18th. With Wang Jia Ban gone, Xian Ni Society will now have two performances, day and night. Those who love music will surely be ecstatic at this news.

It is also heard that after Wang Jia Ban's drama leaves Xian Yue, Wang Junda will reduce expenses and reorganize the team. Because he knows that Xian Ni Society has continued at Xian Yue, he is quite attentive to the venue of the Great China Theater.

### News of the Entertainment World

The Summer Peck Grand Theatre has been taken over by Li Chiyun, a giant of the theater world. The internal renovation of the entire theater has already begun. Initially, Mr. Li sent a letter summoning Ouyang Yuqian, a famous screenwriter in Hong Kong, to return to Shanghai to host the premiere of a drama, but Ouyang declined politely in his reply, as the current environment does not allow him to return. Mr. Li then decided to change his approach, either performing Peking Opera or showing a movie. He plans to choose one of the two and is still considering it closely.

Zhang Zhuxuan, a martial arts performer at Xin Ji Great Stage, has recovered from his abdominal carbuncle and is scheduled to resume performing on the 17th. As for martial arts performer Xu Yunting, because his leg has not fully recovered, he will wait until Zhang takes a leave of absence before reporting his rest and recuperation. He will be on stage at the same time as Xiaosheng Li Junyu and others when the "Thirty-Four Episodes of Journey to the West" are performed.

Clown Yang Yushan, recently suffered an unknown stimulus and became mentally disordered. He asked the Great Stage for leave on the 11th. The day before yesterday, he suddenly left a note bidding farewell to his family and left suddenly, his whereabouts unknown. His relatives and friends are deeply concerned.

Laosheng Wang Juchen has chosen the 23rd day of the third lunar month to marry Kun Dan Wang Yanqiu. He has been preparing everything in recent days and is very busy.

The Great World Lian You She Drama Troupe's public performance last night of the romance drama "I Can't Help but Have Feelings," edited by He Jingyong, was very successful.

When Mr. Yun Sheng, the father of Zhang Shankun, a giant in the film industry, celebrated his sixtieth birthday at the New New Restaurant yesterday, the Peking Opera performed day and night was performed by famous actors and was very wonderful. The day performance was "Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness," from Liu Bei's marriage proposal to Lan Hua's three provocations of Zhou Yu. Ms. Tian Ziwen played Liu Bei without a feminine air, Mr. Wang Shaolou played Zhou Yu, and his performance in times of crisis was very skillful; Ms. Li Xuefang's Sun Shangxiang had a theatrical expression; Wang Chunbai's Qiao Guolao was loyal; and Qian Lintong's Zhao Yun and Zhao Qiao's Zhang Fei can be described as a perfect match; Ms. Li Xiuying's Guo Tai and Wang Fusheng's Sun Quan were both appropriately cast, so they received a lot of applause. The headlining performance of Zhou Xinfang and Gao Boxi's "Xing Han Tu" was missed by me due to business, but I anticipate that it will definitely be wonderful. The night performance of "Xiao He Chasing Han Xin Under the Moon" by Han Langen, Cheng Xiaoting, Guan Xianling, and Yin Xiucen, was humorous and made people laugh until their stomachs hurt. Tang Tonggu and Xie Chenxing's "Pearl Curtain Village" was flawless. Dai Yanwan's "Drunken Concubine" had delicate expressions, vividly portraying the state of a young woman longing for spring due to drunkenness. The few movements of drinking a cup were natural and praiseworthy. The Gu Lan Jun and Gu Mei Jun sisters, one performing "Visiting Relatives," was comical and made people burst into laughter, and the other singing "Fenhe Bay" had accurate pronunciation and a generous appearance. They can be described as two wonders. No wonder the Arabs and their brothers sitting in front of the stage were smiling from ear to ear while watching. Most of the guests that day were famous actors, and they were familiar with the actors on stage, so the performers were very enthusiastic and the audience was very attentive. Before "Fenhe Bay" ended, the midnight bell had already rung. Fearing curfew, I went home first, so I did not get to see Wang Yuanlong and Sun Junbao's "Bai Ma Po," Zhang Wenjuan and Hou Jiankun's "Old General's Victory," Wang Xianqi, Yuan Meiyun, and Yue Feng's "Hong Xiu Xi," and Mao Jianqiu and Tian Ziwen's "Si Lang Visiting His Mother," Wang Shaolou, Qian Lintong, and Li Xiuying's "Filial Son," which I felt was a great pity. It was already dawn when it ended.

### A Glimpse of Dahua

Shanghai on Saturday I saw many dance hall advertisements in this newspaper, especially the Dahua Dance Hall's, which was the most eye-catching. Analyzing the advertisement, it can be divided into three points: The first point is the decoration and layout, which it says is magnificent, like ascending to a golden palace, and also says it is completely dragon-themed. I often frequent Dahua as well, but I have not yet seen the dragon theme, so when my friend asked me to go dancing the next day, I suggested going to see the dragon theme. As for how good-looking the dragon theme is, I think it has been a week, those who have been there have already seen it, and those who have not been there, might as well go to appreciate it. The second point is the music, which it says is conducted by contemporary first-class music arranger Kang Tuo Lailasi and Yi Leqie (18), and there is also Ke Le singing loudly. Ke Le Zan and is that Western fat woman, her singing voice is indeed very loud. The third point says that the dance world's first-class renowned red star tea dance is waiting to teach, and also says that the tea dance lineup is so strong that it cannot be stronger. These two sentences are definitely not bragging. Now I will write some of my observations below:

Yesterday I and several friends went to Dahua again, because I was thinking of writing an article about Dahua, so I asked several friends to count how many dance stars and seats Dahua has. After the music stopped, the first friend reported that there were sixty-four, the second friend reported that there were thirty-seven on one side, and the other side was probably the same number, so it would be seventy-four in total. Then everyone laughed and said that the numbers differed by as many as ten, which was no small matter, and a CPA had to be sent to count in person. A little red star, Ma Baobao, went to check and replied that there were seventy-one, and the case was closed vaguely.

The two most beautiful dance stars at Dahua, one is from Changzhou, surnamed Hu, I don't remember if her name is Hu Ying. Last winter, I was sitting there with Changshu Mei Lanfang, and he pointed her out to me and said that this person can be considered head and shoulders above the rest. I went to ask her to dance, her steps were stiff, and her language had not changed from the local accent. I was surprised that she was not like people here, and asked her that she was from a well-off family in the countryside who fled here. She herself said that if it were not for the pressure of family life, she would never have been willing to take on this lowly profession; I said, your concept is wrong, as long as people can exchange work for compensation, not violate the law, and not lose their personality, then that is a sacred profession, which is much better than those who sit and enjoy the benefits. Now this Changzhou friend, her clothes are also fashionable, her steps are also skillful; her hair is also permed in curly waves; and her language is not entirely local. But her appearance is still so beautiful, I wonder if she still remembers a few of my words? There is also Yang Meifei, an oval face, plus a pair of eyes that seem to be smiling but not smiling, how intriguing do you think she is? There are three who are lively and innocent, Ma Yuan, Ma Baobao, and Shu Yunlan. Among the three of them, Shu Yunlan seems to be the oldest, but in reality, she is the youngest. Her nickname is Little Hangzhou, and she is very popular at Xian Yue's night dance. Ma Yuanyuan is very sensitive. She will cry after saying three words, and then laugh again in a moment. We gave her the nickname Crazy Woman. Ma Baobao is very gentle. There are also Li Mingzhu, Ru Aina, Hu Meimei, Fang Lili, and Xu Cuiying, who all work at the Metropolitan Night Dance. I wrote about them in the Metropolitan Miscellaneous Notes before. There is also Huang Meiqin, who is a friend of my student, and she also calls me teacher. I heard that she can already sing a whole play of Scolding the Emperor. The Lin Yazhen sisters are very sweet and pleasing. Sister Ma is Ma Yuanyuan's older sister, she does not wear makeup and has her own style. Yingying and Feifei both know how to say humorous things. Ma Qiaoyun's liveliness is even one level higher than Little Hangzhou. There is also a person from Changshu. I met her when I lived in Changshu. Her family runs a shop outside the Dadongmen. She is indeed a small family's daughter, and has a similar situation as the person from Changzhou. I don't know if they two sympathize with each other?

The names of the characters in the play "Four Scholars" are mostly meaningful

Nowadays, fashionable people only know that "Striking the Fishing Family" is a good play for overthrowing local tyrants and evil gentry. So you say that this play has ideas, and I praise it as a valuable play suitable for the current trend. In fact, the evil gentry rely on corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats. Moreover, the evil they do is only within one township. If we talk about it from the root, it is still most important to eliminate corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats. Therefore, in my humble opinion, this play "Four Scholars" is not only more meaningful than "Striking the Fishing Family," but also the plot is more exciting. Therefore, I want to praise it especially. The names of the protagonist Song Shijie and the four scholars in this play are all meaningful. The two words "Song Shijie" are homophones for "litigation master." Originally, as an old man with white hair and the owner of a small inn, he was actually able to sue a circuit intendant, a local tyrant, and a county magistrate. Although he was sentenced to exile in the end, his righteous daughter noticed that the current investigating censor was the fortune teller, Liu Lin, who wrote the complaint. Therefore, he turned back and said, "The crime of suing is not as great as the crime of writing the complaint. If no one writes the complaint, the lawsuit cannot be filed." As a result, the Censor Mao was also afraid of being punished, so he personally came down from the hall to untie him. Later, he even submitted a memorial recommending him to be an associate minister. Looking at it this way, he is truly worthy of being called a master of litigation.

The cause of this story is that Yao Tian killed her younger brother-in-law Yao Yanmei. Later, Yanmei's concubine, Yang Suzhen, reported her. She then returned to her mother's home and angrily asked her younger brother, Tian Lun, to secretly intercede. Scholar Tian was originally an investigating censor who had not yet received his credentials to take office. Moreover, he had sworn an oath with four classmates at the Shuangta Temple before the God of Literature, saying, "God is above, disciples Mao Peng, Tian Lun, Jue Du, Liu Ti, this time we are officials outside, if there are officials who pass (a case), secretly intercede, take bribes and let (criminals) go, or approve a rebellious case based on favoritism, each will carry a coffin and return to our hometowns facing upwards." Since he had made such an oath, he would certainly not approve his sister's request. However, it was ruined by his loving mother's bowing. He was then forced to issue this, and only then did he disobey his conscience and secretly send a letter to intercede for the approval of this rebellious case, along with three hundred taels of silver to suppress the book. In this way, even if he violated the oath of the day, he was later dismissed from his post and became a commoner, never to be hired again, and almost lost his own life.

Opening Game Method, Game 29

Black moves first

Reversed Cannon against Central Cannon

The moves continue from the previous game

Rook 9 moves to the center rank 改 Cannon 8 moves to the center rank, Cannon 8 advances 4

(Explanation) The reversed cannon first uses Rook 9 to advance 1 to snatch out the horizontal rook, which is the originator, is not stable. In short, walking all the way with a windy formation carries some deceptive nature, or because the desire for speed is too heavy, hoping for a lucky success. Rook 9 moves to the center rank embodies the desire for speed. Pawn 7 advances 1 to gain the initiative. If you remove the pawn, then Cannon 8 moves to the center rank to hit the horse and gain a piece.

Rook 9 moves to the center rank 改 Cannon 8 moves to the center rank, first avoids the cannon to respond to Pawn 7 advancing 1, but already Cannon 8 advances to double hit the center pawn, making Rook 9 advance 1 with no way to go.
