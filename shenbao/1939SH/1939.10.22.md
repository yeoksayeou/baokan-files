Beijing: According to news from here today, the anti-American movement instigated by the Japanese in various parts of North China has risen again, such as destroying American property, posting anti-American slogans, and ignoring American protests, all of which are prominent.

Editorial

### The Parricide Case in Shanghai

The shocking parricide case involving the Zhou brothers in Shanghai was sentenced by the Special No. 1 Court yesterday. This is indeed a rare criminal case because of its extremely serious nature, shocking the entire Shanghai society. Moreover, in the current society, no one can escape from ethical relationships, so everyone has paid close attention to this major ethical change. Therefore, we should also raise it for review.

When judicial proceedings are underway and have not yet been sentenced, public opinion should remain silent temporarily to avoid hindering the spirit of judicial independence. Although the sentence has now been pronounced, what we want to discuss is not within the scope of legal issues. Because the country has permanent codes, as long as the evidence is conclusive, the criminals will naturally have nowhere to escape. Even if the criminals try to hide their evil deeds with their motives, their perverse and cruel acts have absolutely no justification. Not to mention that they are willing to live outside of society, society will absolutely not tolerate such crimes. Moreover, we are currently in a period of national resistance. The youth have forgotten their own position, clung to family problems, and committed such a great crime that violates the spirit of the Chinese nation. This undoubtedly shows their loss of national consciousness, so there is absolutely no doubt that such people should be subject to the most severe sanctions of national law. Now we need to discuss, beyond the legal issues, why this kind of case occurs in society? What impact will the occurrence of this kind of case have on society? How should society remedy it to avoid the recurrence of this kind of event?

The occurrence of this kind of case naturally indicates that there is a defect in society. In other words, the social order cannot maintain a harmonious form. The reason why the social order cannot maintain harmony is because the times have promoted the collapse of the social system, and ordinary people cannot grasp the correct point of view on things in this turbulent society, resulting in such uncharacteristic behavior. Therefore, when the social system cannot obtain a stable point and get on a track, similar cases will inevitably occur, but perhaps not as cruel as this case.

After the occurrence of this kind of case, society will naturally feel a negative impact. But this does not mean that the same imitation events will inevitably continue to occur in the future. However, in the social psychology, a state of general anxiety will definitely prevail, that is, everyone will have many doubts because of this case. For example, ordinary people may doubt whether the ethics that the Chinese nation has always valued can continue to be maintained in the future? Or because the two unfilial sons in this case have both received school education, so they doubt whether the national education, an important facility of the state, has already declared bankruptcy? Or even because the method of crime in this case is the application of electric current, they doubt whether science is the source of evil? The more developed science is, will the more social evils increase?

In fact, the above doubts are superfluous. First, the ethical relationship will naturally not be abolished as long as the family system has not been eliminated. On the one hand, Chinese society's ethics pay great attention to reciprocity. For example, loyalty and filial piety are mentioned in the same breath as benevolence and love, which indicates that the ethical concept has a tendency to be revised with the progress of the times. On the other hand, Chinese law also respects ethical concepts to a considerable extent, so under the dual relationship of the revision of the concept itself and legal protection, ethics will never fail to continue to be maintained. Second, education should certainly bear considerable responsibility for the behavior of youth, but school education only accounts for one part of education. Zhou Zi's murder of his father cannot be blamed on school education. However, the powerlessness of the school's influence, which cannot guide him to good, is indeed also a fact. Therefore, the question for the future lies only in how the power of education should be strengthened, and it is not necessary to fundamentally doubt the ineffectiveness of education. Third, science itself has no so-called merit or demerit, but depends on how humans apply it. If the defects of society have appropriate ways to correct them, then the development of science is still on track.

In short, a defect occurred in society, causing a portion of the people to lose their rationality and cannot grasp the correct point of view on things. This is the crux of the problem.

How to eliminate the recurrence of this kind of cruel case, the fundamental key is of course the transformation of the social system. Temporary palliative measures must, on the one hand, strengthen the power of the law, and on the other hand, strengthen the role of education. The current education certainly cannot be regarded as sound, but one of the so-called unsound signs is that it often places all the problems that have always been considered difficult to discuss on the list of things not to be discussed. For example, the ethical problem, how to grasp it, educators often avoid reviewing it, so that there is a lack of considerable understanding of the section on what is right and wrong, perhaps this is the fundamental reason for indirectly encouraging evil, which is very worthy of reflection by educators. In addition, there is one point, that is, society is very likely to regard parricide cases as material for jokes recently, and some people will definitely compile materials such as novels, music, and even dramas and movies. We believe that a form of encouraging good and punishing evil will certainly be adopted. But we should know that there is a principle in education, that is, showing people evil examples is enough to arouse the motivation to do evil. So, it is better to teach everyone to "care for flowers and trees" than to write "no picking flowers" in the park. Similarly, it is also doubtful what effect it has to vividly depict and portray a social evil. We cannot but pay considerable attention to this point.

### After the Signing of the Tripartite Agreement, the Situation in Southeastern Europe Changes, Soviet-Turkish Friendship Is Not Affected in the Slightest, The German Route to the Balkans Is Blocked

Paris: The arguments of the newspapers here all believe that the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey will produce the following results: (1) A rapid improvement in Italian-Turkish relations; (2) The possibility of a final compromise between the Soviet Union and Turkey; (3) The blockage of the German route to the Balkans. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that Italy now feels that the neutral Balkan group can resist the oppression of the Soviet Union and limit the expansion of its power. Italy and Turkey have the same position on this Balkan defense policy. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

Capital of Turkey: Foreign Minister Saracoglu recently returned here from the Soviet Union and immediately issued a statement to the press, saying, "I went to Moscow this time and held talks with the Soviet authorities in a friendly environment, which made the original ties between the two countries closer. I am very happy. I had a very good impression when I departed from Moscow to return to my country. I believe this trip will be of great benefit. Both sides have taken this opportunity to reiterate their friendship, and we should continue to talk in the future." (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

Istanbul: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu told the press today that the door to continued negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey has not been closed, but the date cannot be determined. He believes that the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey has no effect on the friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

Paris: According to informed sources here, Germany has used its power to force the Soviet Union to put forward demands in southeastern Europe in an attempt to undermine the establishment of a mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and Turkey. But as a result, Berlin only caused the Soviet-Turkish talks to stop halfway. It is heard that in the tripartite mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and Turkey, a clause allowing Turkey not to engage in military intervention against the Soviet Union was already included in the initial draft. When Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu first decided to talk with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow, he cited this clause to discuss it with Molotov and planned to get the Soviet Union to agree with Turkey's Balkan policy. It is unexpected that Germany wanted to obtain substantial interests in southeastern Europe to compensate for the interests Germany was forced to give up in the north. The Soviet Union, at the request of Berlin, planned to expand the Soviet-Turkish agreement to the aspects required by Germany. One of the most important points was the closure of the Tatar Strait. Although Turkey wanted to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union at this point, it had to stop negotiations. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

### Current Relations Between the Soviet Union and Germany Cannot Be Alienated by Britain and France - Moscow Newspaper Publishes Editorial -

Moscow News published an editorial today reviewing the Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement. The newspaper stated, "The Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement we publish today is a document with extremely important political implications. According to this agreement, if the actions of a certain European power cause a war in the Mediterranean, forcing Turkey to be drawn into the vortex, Britain and France will provide Turkey with assistance. On the other hand, if war breaks out in the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey will provide Britain and France with the same assistance. At the same time, if Britain and France start fighting in order to fulfill their guarantees to Romania and Greece, Turkey must also provide Britain and France with assistance. However, if Turkey's actions will lead to war against the Soviet Union, Turkey may not have to fulfill its promises. This decision, the negotiations completed by Britain, France, and Turkey, is a continuation of the unfinished talks during the spring. In May, Turkey, France, and Turkey established a mutual assistance agreement in principle regarding wars in the Mediterranean. This preliminary agreement has now been transformed into a permanent agreement.

"Since the establishment of this agreement in principle, the international situation has undergone great changes. Britain and France have become belligerents. Given the current new situation, the Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement has occupied an extremely important position. The British and French newspapers expressed great satisfaction with this agreement, pointing to it as clear evidence of the consolidation of the Allied position. It is also noteworthy that when this agreement was signed, General Weygand, the commander of the French garrison in Syria, and General Wavell, the commander of the British Near East Defense Forces, both personally went to the Turkish capital to negotiate with the Turkish General Staff. Britain and France's emphasis on Turkey stems from the importance of Turkey's military position. Although a certain situation has made people believe that British and French foreign policy is not limited to establishing an agreement with Turkey. British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in a speech to Parliament that the Anglo-French-Turkish talks had ended three weeks ago, and the reason for the delay in the mutual assistance agreement was due to the negotiations between the Turkish Foreign Minister and the Soviet authorities in Moscow. Mr. Zhang also pointed out the hope for the signing of the Soviet-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement, but given the contradiction between the terms of the Soviet-Turkish agreement and Turkey's obligations to the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement, this hope is impossible. From Mr. Zhang's speech, it can be seen that the British and French diplomatic circles firmly believe that the Soviet-Turkish agreement does have a chance of being established. At the same time, the British and French newspapers all pointed to the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement as a touchstone of German-Soviet friendship. All of this shows that someone is planning to alienate Germany and the Soviet Union. Obviously, this plan is to promote the establishment of parallel agreements between the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Britain, France, and Turkey, and to lead the Soviet Union to join the group against Germany and the enemies of Britain and France in the Mediterranean region. In order to be loyal to its peaceful policies and protect the national interests of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has made timely and accurate estimates of the diplomatic actions of Britain and France, which gamble on Soviet-Turkish friendship. The clear and firm position of the Soviet Union has completely failed the "clever" plan to incite German-Soviet ill feelings. Undoubtedly, the new Anglo-French-Turkish agreement has promoted a new equilibrium in the Mediterranean. Since the Soviet Union is the largest power in the Black Sea, it must pay close attention to all actions related to the Black Sea. The Anglo-French-Turkish agreement does not affect the direct interests of the Soviet Union. Turkey's obligations have been clearly stated in the annex to the agreement. Turkey does not participate in any actions that could cause war against the Soviet Union. "The Anglo-French-Turkish agreement cannot be regarded as an instrument of peace. The agreement proves that Britain and France have dragged Turkey into the path of war. According to this agreement, Turkey must assist Britain and France in fighting against Germany and Italy. It is said that the Soviet Union will suffer losses due to the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement, which is absolutely untrue. The Soviet Union did not participate in the belly agreement, and still maintains its neutrality and freedom. From the standpoint of maintaining peace, this is a good phenomenon. However, in Turkey's case, it is another matter. The obligations assumed by Turkey will affect its policies in the near future. In any case, the Soviet Union does not need to express regret for what has happened." (TASS dispatch on the 21st)

### Turkish Army Has Strong Strength and Is Completely Modernized - Far From What It Used to Be

London. A military commentator here recently criticized the efficiency of the Turkish army, saying that after Turkey made peace with Greece, former President Kemal began to reorganize the army, completely changing the Turkish army. Turkish soldiers are no longer comparable to those who were only brave but lacked training in the past. At present, the strict training and timely payment of Turkish troops have made discipline strict, and there are excellent military schools, creating capable and well-trained officers. The training methods of the Turkish army focus on mobile warfare, and attention is paid to transportation. Aircraft. And the efficiency of wartime traffic, Yun is attention, Kemal is more in the surplus of the army, for the modern army inseparable from the industry to vigorously revitalize, Turkey in wartime, its entire manpower, is very easy to mobilize, (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

Finnish Capital. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a statement stating that Finland is very satisfied with the results of the summit of the four Nordic countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now drafting instructions, which Basikivi will take to Moscow tomorrow night to continue negotiations with the Soviet authorities. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

Danish Capital. According to diplomatic circles here, the Finnish government has decided to strengthen its delegation to Moscow for negotiations. In addition to Special Envoy Basikivi, Minister of Finance Tangler. And an expert in international law will also serve as a representative. It is reported that this matter was decided after consultations between Finnish Foreign Minister Esko and Norwegian Foreign Minister Got. Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler. It is widely believed that the purpose of Finland's strengthening of the delegation is to express its willingness to carefully consider various issues raised by Moscow. Political figures predict that the Moscow negotiations will not necessarily fail. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)

Finnish Capital. Finnish Foreign Minister Eko told a Reuters reporter today that the Soviet-Finnish talks have been conducted in a spirit of friendship from beginning to end, and no pressure has been applied. If this spirit can continue to exist, then there may be a satisfactory solution. As for the rumors that any new issues will arise in subsequent negotiations, they are not credible. He expects that the Soviet Union will not make any new demands. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

Swedish Capital. The "New Zurich Daily" recently carried a statement saying that Finland should provide the Soviet Union with concrete guarantees, stating that it will never allow a third country to attack the Soviet Union through its territory. The country's policy of absolute neutrality should be guaranteed by other Nordic countries. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

Rome. Various newspapers recently carried news from Finnish capital stating that the demands made by the Soviet government to Finland are more significant than generally expected. For example, the cession of the port of Viborg in eastern Finland is one end of it. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

London. Regarding the situation between Finland and the Soviet Union, the news received here from Finland is not enough to make people feel relieved. Observing various signs, the country is already ready and determined to maintain independence at any cost. In addition, as winter approaches, the climate and geography of Northern Europe are conducive to defense. It is firmly believed that if the Soviet Union does invade, it will be difficult to drive straight in. For this reason, after the Finnish representative Basikivi returns to Moscow tomorrow, he will try to find a compromise solution. However, if the Soviet Union rejects it, he is also prepared to deal with all incidents. If war is inevitable, the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula can provide Finland with military equipment, but they will not provide direct military assistance. In Finland, there is hope that a more powerful country will come to help. This layer will cause extremely subtle problems along the Baltic Sea, because Germany and the Soviet Union are in a position of conflicting interests in this corner of Europe. If other countries intervene, it will make the collusion between Germany and the Soviet Union even closer, which is well understood by Britain and France. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

### German-Soviet Economic Talks - Compromise Reached in Principle - Details to be Discussed

Moscow. The German economic delegation, led by Dr. Schnur, an economic expert from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came here to negotiate with Soviet Foreign Trade People's Commissar Mikoyan to discuss the promotion of trade between the two countries. It has lasted for two weeks. According to well-informed sources here, this conversation has made significant progress, and the two sides have reached a compromise in principle. In the future, various details will be determined. It is expected that it will take another week to establish an agreement. It is heard that both Germany and the Soviet Union are willing to buy goods from each other but are unwilling to sell goods, which is unexpected by the general public. The Soviet government has also made a list of the machinery and industrial equipment that the country wants to order from Germany. Therefore, some representatives of the German delegation are preparing to return to their country in order to allocate this order to domestic factories. As for what kind of raw materials the Soviet Union can supply to Germany, the outside world does not know. It is rumored that the Soviet government has promised to supply Germany with all of its production, except for domestic consumption. This promise seems very generous on the surface, but it is still empty in practice. According to the official statistics published before the mobilization of the Red Army, the production of general raw materials in the Soviet Union is not enough to meet domestic consumption. As for the domestic production situation after the mobilization, the official has not yet published any figures. In terms of Germany, in order to continue the war, it is eager to purchase 2 million tons of manganese and 2 million tons of kerosene from the Soviet Union. There are many manganese mines in the Soviet Union, but the pure manganese content of its ore is very thin, and most of it has not yet been developed, so it is difficult to export in large quantities for a while. As for 2 million tons of kerosene, it is equivalent to the total export volume of the Soviet Union last year. Since the mobilization of the Red Army, the domestic demand for kerosene has increased, and the export volume this year must be reduced accordingly. In addition, the tractors used in rural areas also need gasoline. The government has recently requisitioned a large amount of gasoline for rural use, which will also have an impact on the export volume of kerosene. In addition, Germany heard that it hopes that the Soviet Union will immediately supply the country with various raw materials, and not be satisfied with how it can supply them in the future. Because of these reasons, most of the German delegation's representatives often travel between Berlin and Moscow, hoping to find a solution to this difficult problem. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

### Germany Intensifies Diplomatic Activities - Papen Returns to Berlin - Long Talk with Hitler

Berlin. According to authoritative sources here, after Britain and France decided to continue the war, the talks between Germany and the Soviet Union will be intensified in a diplomatic way. There is also the same exchange of views between Berlin and Rome. People in Berlin believe that Romania's attitude will not be affected by the British, French, and Turkish publics, because the guarantee given to Romania by the United Kingdom this spring is only one-sided in nature. The Romanian government has repeatedly stated that it will not become a bilateral agreement, and at the same time, the political and economic relations between Germany and Romania have become closer recently. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)

Berlin. German Ambassador to Turkey Papen was summoned back to his country to report and arrived in Berlin last night. The rumor that German Ambassador to Russia Schulenburg was also summoned back to his country has been solemnly denied by authoritative sources. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)

The "National Daily" here stated that "After German Ambassador to Turkey Papen returned to Berlin, he immediately paid a visit to the head of Hitler, and talked with each other for several hours. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is extremely concerned about the signing of the Mutual Assistance Deed by the three countries of Britain, France, and Turkey, and said that this move has created a new situation. Even if the Soviet Union and Turkey continue to negotiate in the future, there is no way to influence it. In addition, the general public in Germany feels extremely dissatisfied that Turkey has allowed Britain to manipulate it." (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

Berlin. Regarding the French allegations that the German army recently advanced to the Western Front and adopted a large-scale offensive, the person in charge here yesterday met with foreign reporters and added that all the facts can detail the war report issued by the German army the day before.

Moreover, the German war report has already stated that no fierce battles have occurred on the Western Front so far. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)

Paris. The French artillery yesterday fired at the German mountain positions between the Moselle and Peer villages, attempting to expand the "no-man's land" and prevent the German army from reorganizing its newly occupied areas. It is said that when the French army retreated earlier, the German army used motorcycle units to take the opportunity to attack, but was repelled by the French army. The climate on the front line is very bad, with heavy rain, but the defense on both sides is still very strict. There are no air battles. Although the German side claims victory, the French army said that all the key points in the Walter Tall Forest, and the southwest and northwest of Saarlouis, are still in the hands of the French army. The new areas acquired by the German army have no strategic value. (Associated Press dispatch on the 21st)

### Roosevelt Talks About Territorial Waters - The Boundary Can Extend from Three Miles to Hundreds of Miles from the Shore

Hyde Park City, USA. After President Roosevelt ordered yesterday to prohibit submarines of all belligerent countries from entering US territorial waters, he issued a statement saying that the boundary of territorial waters can extend from three miles from the shore to hundreds of miles, depending on the situation. As far as submarines of belligerent countries are concerned, this boundary is three miles, but our country's patrol fleet, whose duty is to maintain neutrality, has a much larger scope of territorial waters, roughly equivalent to the security zone delineated by the Panama Declaration (i.e. the declaration issued by the Pan-American Conference). In short, the breadth of the scope of territorial waters should be based on maintaining security and neutrality. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

### Ambassador Kuo's Statement: China's Stance Remains Unchanged; Cole's Suggestion of Peace is Baseless; Grew's Remarks Sufficient to Awaken the Japanese People

London. Ambassador Kuo Tai-chi, China's envoy to the United Kingdom, told a Reuters correspondent that the Japanese-spread rumor that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, had suggested peace terms in Chongqing, served a different purpose and was entirely baseless. The Japanese side has been releasing peace feelers for some time, but China has never changed its position. China believes that peace is impossible unless the Japanese troops withdraw from Chinese territory. As China has recently repelled the Japanese offensives in Hunan and Shanxi provinces, achieving great victories, it will naturally not change its position. Responsible circles in London also indicated that the Japanese news was purely fabricated. (Reuters, 21st)

London. A Reuters correspondent recently asked Chinese Ambassador to the UK Kuo Tai-chi for his opinion on the frank remarks made by US Ambassador to Japan Grew regarding US-Japan relations. Kuo said that in his view, Ambassador Grew had done the Japanese people a real service of friendship. The Japanese people, like the German people, are never allowed to know the truth. Now Grew has made remarks that are endorsed by Washington, which should awaken the Japanese people from the delusion of a fool's paradise. London officials have not yet received a report from the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, so they are not commenting on Grew's remarks at this time. However, they acknowledge that if the reported remarks are indeed accurate, then this is a most important event. Circles concerned with the Far East generally believe that the US government, in view of the upcoming negotiations on renewing the US-Japan commercial treaty, wishes to give Japan a clear warning about the US attitude towards Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia." (Reuters, 21st)

### Nomonhan: Negotiations Concluded; Japanese and Soviet Armies Announce: On-Site Negotiations Detailed

Changchun. The Kwantung Army authorities, in the name of the "Press Officer," announced on the 21st the details of the negotiations between the Japanese and Soviet armies regarding the Nomonhan Incident after the armistice agreement was concluded on September 15. After the conclusion of the Moscow armistice agreement regarding the Nomonhan Incident on September 15, the Japanese military authorities immediately began negotiations with the Soviet Mongolian military committee at the site, proceeding with the armistice affairs in succession. Now, on October 21, the on-site affairs have ended. During the period of negotiations on the frontline, negotiations between the two sides on the implementation of the armistice, the recovery of corpses, and the exchange of prisoners of war all progressed smoothly, and were implemented according to the resolutions. Therefore, since the end of September, negotiations have been conducted on the handling of prisoners and fugitives, as well as the return of other detainees unrelated to this incident. By October 21, the negotiations had stalled. Thereupon, the Japanese military authorities decided to avoid delaying the on-site affairs and entrusted the resolution of these issues to other negotiations, thus ending the on-site negotiations. According to this decision, although the Nomonhan Incident was only a border incident, due to its inherent characteristics, it also caused considerable shock both domestically and abroad. Furthermore, due to the characteristics of modern warfare, both sides suffered great sacrifices, making people deeply feel the importance of securing national borders and defending national territory. Now that the on-site negotiations have come to an end, we have new feelings, and we want to express our deepest gratitude to the fighting soldiers and the loyal souls who died for their country. Furthermore, a quick glance at the current European situation makes us even more acutely aware of the urgency of strengthening our national defense capabilities. The Japanese military authorities are determined to advance toward the national defense line based on the fundamental meaning of the joint defense of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, so as to live up to the enthusiasm of the people in the rear. (Daimeng Electric, 21st)

Changchun. The on-site negotiations on the Nomonhan Incident ended today. The Japanese and Soviet sides have not yet reached a consensus on the handling of prisoners and fugitive soldiers, as well as the method of returning other detainees unrelated to this incident. It has now been decided that, with the understanding of the representatives of the two armies, the resolution of these issues will be entrusted to the upcoming diplomatic negotiations between Japan, Manchukuo, and the Soviet Union. (Daimeng Electric, 21st)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Explains Diplomatic Policy; Aiming to Build a New Order

Tokyo. Foreign Minister Nomura visited the Ise Grand Shrine today after taking office as Foreign Minister. During the train ride, he gave a statement to reporters, stating briefly that he intends to exchange frank and candid views on the situation in East Asia with US Ambassador to Japan Grew as soon as possible. The Foreign Minister also announced that he will devote himself to the following matters: (1) Establishing normal relations with the Soviet Union; (2) Resolving the China Incident; (3) Adhering to the Anti-Comintern Pact. The friendly relations with Germany and Italy will be maintained as before. Regarding the resolution of the China Incident, it will begin with assisting the "New Central Government" of China. This government will be established soon, and Japan will assist its sound growth based on the policies already decided, and intends to fully consider China's actual situation and the general situation, so as not to leave any regrets. The Japanese government hopes to organize China's "New Central Government" as soon as possible, and hopes that it can have sufficient power and gain the trust of all of China. Japan's efforts to resolve the China Incident have been hampered by the direct or indirect assistance of various third countries to the Chiang Kai-shek regime. As a result of the outbreak of the European war, the countries that aided Chiang are now unable to continue providing assistance. The real purpose of Japan in resolving the China Incident is the establishment of a New Order in East Asia. As for the New Order in East Asia that we desire, it is not an order that excludes foreigners, as some third countries suspect, but an order that will enable East Asia to make an effective contribution to world peace and development in its position. The Japanese nation's determination to establish this order is not fragile, and cannot be changed by the intervention of one or several countries. In fact, it is extremely firm, with a "burn the boats" mentality. Therefore, the key to Japan's adjustment of relations with third countries lies in understanding the above two points. The Foreign Minister also mentioned relations with Britain and France, saying that the key to adjusting relations between Japan and Britain and France lies in Britain and France fully understanding the great significance of the New Order in East Asia and cooperating with Japan. The Foreign Minister also mentioned the round-table conference between Britain and Japan on the Tianjin Incident, saying that Japan's intentions have been notified to Britain in the recent Tokyo conference. Future developments depend entirely on Britain's ability to understand Japan's position. The Foreign Minister expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the Gulangyu issue, saying that since the public concession in the area can be avoided from becoming a base for anti-Japanese activities, the situation in the area can naturally return to normal. The Foreign Minister then mentioned US Ambassador Grew's return to his post and his frank expression of the US attitude toward Japan's actions in China, saying that he wished to exchange views with him on the situation in the United States and East Asia as soon as possible. We are undertaking the great responsibility of building East Asia with a long-term vision and firm determination, so we ask the United States to correctly understand this purpose and the determination of Japan. What the United States is most concerned about at the moment is how to prevent the catastrophe in Europe from spreading to the Americas. Japan shares the same feeling and is working hard to prevent the European war from extending to Japan. The United States may be fully aware of Japan's position, so the United States and Japan should cooperate with each other to protect peace in the Pacific. The Foreign Minister also mentioned the Soviet Union, saying that his policy is to adjust relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. The peaceful resolution of border issues and other outstanding issues has greatly improved relations between the two countries. Since the signing of the Nomonhan armistice agreement, the exchange of corpses and prisoners of war has been implemented. The joint demarcation commission will be organized soon to jointly survey the disputed border near Nomonhan. As for Japan's relations with Germany and Italy, some aspects are misunderstood. Some believe that the Anti-Comintern Pact has become a piece of waste paper after the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. However, Japan has always regarded the Anti-Comintern Pact as the foundation of its national policy, so Japan's relations with Germany and Italy are not affected in the slightest. Finally, the Foreign Minister expressed his views on the European war, saying that although Hitler has the desire for peace, the war will inevitably be prolonged due to the Soviet Union's advances in the Baltic Sea and other factors. It is difficult to speculate on the future development of Europe. (Reuters, 21st)

### Various Parties in Chongqing Express Pleasure with Ambassador Grew's Speech; Officials Believe it is of Great Significance; All Newspapers Give it High Praise; US Public Opinion Also Unanimously Commends it

Chongqing. US Ambassador to Japan Grew's speech in Tokyo exposing Japanese crimes was published in newspapers on this weekend, and people throughout Chongqing were generally pleased. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited a certain authoritative expert on international affairs this afternoon to ask for his views on Grew's speech. He said the following points. The expert first stated that Grew's speech was of great significance. Since Japan began its war of aggression against China, the interests and rights of the United States in China have been continuously undermined and occupied. The US government has repeatedly protested to the Japanese side, but the Japanese government has never paid attention. It was not until December 31 last year that the US government made a general protest resolving to safeguard its rights and interests and protect justice. However, due to Japan's barbarity, it did not produce any results. Therefore, Ambassador Grew decided to stand on the position of the Nine-Power Treaty, and publicly clarified to the Japanese people with a sincere and straightforward attitude the determination of the United States to maintain its original position in the Far East, and exposed the Japanese government's various crimes of ignoring treaty obligations, thereby urging the Japanese people to have a thorough understanding and awareness of the United States' consistent policy in the Far East and the absurdity of its government's measures. As for Japan's repeated claims of building the so-called "New Order in East Asia," Ambassador Grew also gave it the most fierce criticism based on the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. The so-called New Order in East Asia by Japan is indeed another name for dominating East Asia. This is in fact a violation of the true spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. The main points of the Nine-Power Treaty are the Open Door Policy, equal opportunity, and respect for China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. Japan is also one of the signatory countries, but now it blatantly disregards the constraints of the treaty, interferes with American interests in China, and further wants to realize its dream of monopolizing the Far East. Therefore, the United States resolutely opposes and does not recognize its establishment of the (New Order in East Asia). The expert finally said that the US Ambassador also severely condemned Japan's arbitrary bombing in China, regardless of humanitarianism. Not only have the lives and property of American expatriates suffered significant damage, but also the various inhumane abuses suffered by Chinese civilians have angered the American people who have a sense of justice. In summary, Ambassador Grew's speech was based on humanitarianism, maintaining American interests and rights in the Far East, and respecting the principles of China's territorial and administrative integrity and sovereignty. (Telegraph, 21st)

Chongqing. According to official sources here today, US Ambassador to Japan Grew's remarks in Tokyo merely express the United States' historical friendship with China, and at the same time express the United States' firm attitude toward its rights and interests in the Far East. Even more so, it expresses the United States' feeling toward acts of aggression and its determination not to recognize the conquest of land by force. Moreover, on December 31 of last year, the United States sent a note to Japan, but Japan has not yet responded. Later, due to the increasingly confrontational relations between Japan and the United States, the US government began to terminate the US-Japan commercial treaty. Ambassador Grew's speech today is merely a restatement of the position already stated in the various notes sent by the United States to Japan. Furthermore, all the newspapers here have given Ambassador Grew's remarks large-character headlines and attached lengthy commentaries. According to the Central Daily News, Grew's speech has two meanings. On the positive side, it reiterates the US position of not recognizing the occupation of land by force. On the negative side, it refutes various Japanese theories of aggression, such as the "New Order in East Asia." At the same time, Grew has made it clear to Japanese propagandists that the world is not easily deceived, and that their various propaganda intended to confuse the public has been a complete failure. The newspaper concluded that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States' attitude has so far only been expressed in verbal and written statements. What the world hopes and expects now is action from the United States. The fact that the United States is now prepared for practical action has aroused the supreme admiration of the Chinese people. The Ta Kung Pao, on the other hand, believes that "the bright era of the Pacific has arrived." It said that the United States has fully recognized the truth in the Far East, and has decided not to be an accomplice any longer, but to punish the ringleader. According to the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper Xinhua Daily, the economic lifeline of Japanese imperialism is entirely in the hands of the United States. Therefore, it is as easy as turning one's hand to restrain Japan by imposing sanctions on Japan by the United States. In other words, the United States only needs not to renew its commercial treaty with Japan, stop trading with Japan, and ban arms trade, and it will be able to control Japan's fate. In addition to this, if it can continue to lend money to China, it will be able to promote the early restoration of peace and order in the Far East. The Chinese Army's newspaper, the Saodang Bao, said that Grew's speech has further strengthened our determination to fight to the end, and has strengthened our belief that "final victory must belong to us." Although we have formulated a policy of obtaining victory purely through our own efforts, we also believe that the sympathy and spiritual assistance of foreign countries have great power. The Shishi Xinbao stated that Grew's speech was a major blow to the Japanese. In order to eliminate the atmosphere of the "New Order in East Asia," we hope that the United States will use great determination and strong action to support the Nine-Power Treaty, because the Nine-Power Treaty and the "New Order in East Asia" cannot coexist. (United Press, 11th)

New York. The US newspapers unanimously praised US Ambassador to Japan Grew's remarks that the US opposes the "New Order in East Asia," and regarded it as a clear warning to Japan. The New York Sun said that we should make it clear to Japan that Grew's criticism of Japan fully represents US public opinion. What the Japanese military has done in China has not been interfered with in the past, but it seems that it should not be tolerated any longer today. The general opinion in the United States is that enlightened people in Japan should now try to limit the actions of their warlords. The New York Times placed Grew's remarks on the front page with a very large headline, "Grew's Warning to Japan," and a sub-headline, "Signals Further Action by US to Curb Japanese Militarists." The New York Herald Tribune also published Grew's speech in a prominent position, with the large headline "Grew Warns Japan" and sub-headlines such as "US Indignant at Japan's Actions." The New York Daily Mirror's headline was, "Grew's Speech Has Shaken the Japanese Political World." (Associated Press, 21st)

### Situation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania Before the Outbreak of the European War

— Translated by Bo Ming from the London Times

This article describes the situation in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in great detail, but it was written before Germany invaded Poland. Therefore, its arguments no longer align with the current situation. After the Soviet Union and Germany divided Poland, the three countries, under the pressure of the Soviet Union's power, signed various treaties with the Soviet Union, sacrificing many significant interests in exchange for temporary security. Their planned strategies have all become impossible to implement. The rapid changes in the international situation this year can be described as unprecedented. The countries that are most affected are the smaller ones. Currently, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland are underway, and it is not known what the outcome will be. However, it can be predicted that small countries will always suffer some losses and make significant concessions in order to avoid disaster. Even the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, as well as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium, are now uneasy, fearing that Germany will violate their neutrality, enter their territory under false pretenses, and attack the British and French armies. In short, the word "trust" has completely disappeared from international relations. Not only small countries, but even large countries cannot rest easy.

Translator

Latvia and Estonia signed non-aggression pacts with Germany and obtained beneficial compromises. The German government initially wanted to conclude separate bilateral agreements with the two countries but ultimately agreed that the contents of the two agreements should be the same and signed simultaneously. Therefore, these two Baltic states have given Germany two new bilateral agreements, without abandoning their principle of maintaining an independent and united stance in the world.

Latvia and Estonia were born together twenty years ago during the Russian split and fought side by side for the right to survive. In the earliest days, the two countries' armies were often strangely mixed together. Estonians fought in Latvian territory, and the current Latvian Foreign Minister was one of the Latvians who once fought against the common enemy in the Estonian army.

These twin republics, with Estonia being slightly older, were recognized de facto by Britain on May 3, 1918, and similarly by Latvia in November of the same year. However, in the following two years, the two countries continued to fight mixed battles, sometimes against invading Red Army forces, and sometimes against the remnants of the old German army—because the Germans had occupied most of the Baltic states, and the deposed German Emperor even personally visited Riga.

The Soviet Union signed peace treaties with Estonia and Latvia on February 2 and August 11, 1920, respectively. Apart from Brest-Litovsk, these were the first resolutions of the Soviet government. They have always maintained the foundation of their relations. The independence and borders formally recognized at that time have never been threatened. The few revolutionary attempts by internal communist elements were also easily defeated. In the early years after 1930, the two countries gradually became tired of the parliamentary system. At that time, the parliament, controlled by many inexperienced leaders of various parties, had lost its original purpose and evolved into an unhealthy focal point for constant disputes. This kind of dispute not only made the political situation lack stability and purpose but even caused serious internal strife, threatening the country. Therefore, the original leaders who fought for independence in the two countries resolutely rose up to lead again. After several years of strenuous reorganization and reform, they created their own legislative and administrative systems. These systems differed from each other in the two republics and were also different from the systems of other countries in many respects. However, they contained parliamentary elections and still had a slightly moderate dictatorial nature.

Latvia and Estonia seem to have no enemies in the world. Of course, they themselves are not enemies of any country. All they care about is developing their own small natural resources, sending fishing boats and merchant ships to the high seas, and promoting peaceful exchanges with neighboring countries. The last point mentioned is the most important and a necessary condition for the existence of both countries.

People generally call Latvia and Estonia the axis of peace in Europe, forming an obstacle between Germany and the Soviet Union with Poland and Romania. The politicians of the Baltic states never forget this point and always base their foreign policy on it, maintaining good neighborly relations with the Soviet Union and Germany, without giving any benefit to either side that would inevitably annoy the other. Even in the early years, when Germany seemed farther from the Baltic countries than it is today, the two countries did not give the Soviet Union exclusive benefits. Although they had tried to establish closer economic relations, they never considered political entanglements. Last year, the two countries declared strict neutrality, which will give them a small chance in wartime. The two countries have never seriously considered automatically joining the German side because this move would prompt the Soviet army to advance to the Baltic coast. The Baltic countries would inevitably become battlefields and be destroyed. No matter how the war progresses, if they were to join the Soviet side, it would be equivalent to allowing the Soviet army to assist in the defense of the coastline, risking the annexation of valuable seaports such as Tallinn, Riga, Ventspils, and Liepāja by the Soviet Union. However, when Germany proposed concluding non-aggression pacts, the two countries hesitated little or not at all, because these two agreements had some protective value and could not cause any harm. It was only natural that if they refused, it would inevitably provoke Germany to accuse them of favoring the Soviet Union. The two countries had already concluded several similar agreements with the Soviet Union, and this additional agreement with Germany was, at least in theory, another guarantee of neutrality.

### Re-adjusting Transportation in Fujian Province; Approximately 50,000 Porters Throughout the Province, and Joint Transportation with Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi

Fuzhou dispatch: The authorities of Fujian Province, in order to consolidate local defense and facilitate inter-provincial transportation, have adjusted the transportation agencies throughout the province. Coastal highways have been completely destroyed, and inland highways have been expanded. Currently, this work has been completed. Transportation in coastal counties, where there are streams and rivers, is carried out by sailing ships. Roads are entirely using manpower. Therefore, the general labor force has become active. In the southern Fujian region, along the line from Fuzhou via Fuqing, Putian, to Xianyou, and from Putian via Xianyou, Hui'an, to Quanzhou, there are more than 2,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. From Putian via Xianyou, Yongchun, to Dehua, and from Quanzhou via Nan'an to Yongchun, there are more than 1,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. From Quanzhou via Tong'an, Haicheng to Zhangzhou, there are more than 3,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. In the eastern Fujian region, from Fuzhou via Lianjiang, Luoyuan, to Ningde, and from Ningde via Xiapu, Fu'an, to Fuding and Shouning, there are more than 1,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. In the northern Fujian region, from Fuzhou via Gutian to Jian'ou, there are more than 1,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. In the western Fujian region, from Changting to Ruijin, there are more than 3,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. From Yongding to Dabu, there are more than 2,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. The above numbers refer to long-distance organized porters. The numbers for short-distance unorganized porters are not included. The total number is more than double. Therefore, it is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 porters throughout the province. The average daily wage is one yuan per person, totaling 50,000 yuan. As for transportation tools, in addition to a portion carried on shoulders, the rest is carried by mules and horses or pushed by handcarts. The Provincial Military Shipping Company, in order to adapt to environmental needs, has established a manual transportation office in Fuzhou, divided into iron-shoulder and handcart departments, to manage transportation affairs in the eastern and southern Fujian regions, with the aim of facilitating commerce. As for inland transportation, Fujian-Zhejiang and Fujian-Jiangxi have direct traffic, and the business is extremely developed. They are also managed by the transportation company. The freight rate is two cents per 100 market pounds per 10 kilometers. Currently, joint water, land, and air transportation has been organized with Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, so that goods needed to be shipped out of this province and goods needed to be shipped into this province can be smoothly transported without hindrance. Agriculture, industry, and commerce will not be affected by the sea blockade and can still progress as usual.

### Fake Youth League Attacked Outside the South Gate of Wuxi; Fake Captain Killed on the Spot

Wuxi dispatch: At the original site of Wuxi Private Middle School outside the South Gate of Wuxi, at Yangyao Bay, there is now a fake "Youth League Volunteer Army Wuxi Branch Recruitment Office." Zhou Xiaofu, a person named Yi Xi from a former police officer, is the fake captain. At about 4:00 p.m. on the 17th, more than 50 mobile team members, carrying rifles, box cannons, and submachine guns, came from Dongting and swarmed into the fake recruitment office, opening fire. Zhou Xiaofu was shot and killed on the spot. Two other fake league members were seriously injured. By the time the nearby Japanese army and the puppet pacification team heard the news and rushed over, the mobile team had already gone far away.

Lido attacked against the wind. Sun Jinshun first got Qiuting's help and shot his foot. French Merchants goalkeeper Bao Saizhong caught it and threw it out. Jinshun continued to shoot several times, but ultimately failed due to Bao Saizhong's agility. French Merchants center forward Laobusi Tuofu had a shooting opportunity. Fortunately, Lu Zhong'en fell to the ground and escaped the difficulty. Cao Qiuting started from the left, and Sun Jinshun shot with iron legs, but unfortunately hit the goalpost. At 30 minutes, the city defense was tight, and Li Yichen accidentally fouled and was penalized with a penalty kick. Jiemuhuate kicked and broke the net, and the French Merchants scored first. Lido general Sun Jinshun increased his anger and went straight in, more than ten yards away from the goal, and shot hard, but Bao Saizhong was an old general after all and saved it by diving to the ground. After that, Lido had very few opportunities to attack. Before the end of the first half, he was again lightly kicked by Laobusi Tuofu, and Zhong'en watched it enter the net, unable to save it. In the first half, the French Merchants took the lead with 2-0.

Returning the Favor, Three in a Row

After the lemon, Lido's offensive was still absent. After ten minutes of stalemate, Li Yichen dribbled to the baseline, and Ke Laiduo rushed to foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Xu Wenkui kicked and pulled back a goal. From then on, Lido's momentum greatly increased. Jinshun pounced on the enemy's formation. Xuan Qiuting passed to Wenkui, and Wenkui picked up and sent to Jinshun. Sun hooked and shot on the ground, but was caught by Bao Saizhong. French Merchants right forward Diwei Que Lin was unwilling to show weakness and shot flat with his foot, hitting Zhong'en in the chest. Zhong'en threw it out with both hands. At this time, Lido quickly replaced Li Jiang to increase the offensive. At 30 minutes, Jinshun scored with a beautiful foot, making it 2-2. Five minutes later, Lido's Zhang Mingsheng picked up and sent Qiuting. Qiuting shot from 30 yards away, and the ball went into the left corner, clear and beautiful. Lido then reversed the defeat with 3-2.

### Overview of Moral Education in National Higher Education (3); Implementation of the Tutor System

In the past, our country's education only focused on the transmission of knowledge and neglected moral education, so there was criticism of "teaching" but not "educating." In 1931, the League of Nations Education Inspection Team provided many opinions on our country's university education, such as: "The educational level of certain universities is actually too low. Students' past training is insufficient and they do not have the level to study at university, but they are also admitted to university. In the past, they relied on formal education, especially relying on classroom lectures, and did not pay attention to group research and tutor work, nor did they know that they should encourage students to engage in independent research. The relationship between teachers and students is not very close, so as a result, the educational efficiency and academic atmosphere of the university are harmed." In order to correct this bias and make the relationship between teachers and students close and achieve the effect of personality influence, the Ministry of Education, in reference to our country's old system of teachers and Confucian scholars and the British requirement, ordered the schools to implement it. The method is for each school to divide the students in each grade into several groups, with each group having five to fifteen people. Each group has one tutor, who is appointed by the principal to be a full-time teacher, and one chief tutor or moral education director is appointed to manage all student moral education affairs in the school. The tutor should understand the students' thoughts, behavior, academic performance, and physical and mental health, and give strict moral education to make them develop normally and cultivate a healthy personality. The tutor should record the above items in detail according to the format and report to the school and the students' parents every month. The educational administrative organs in charge may review the school report at any time. The tutor should be responsible for the students who receive training. If they make special contributions in academics or career after being in school or after graduating, the honor should be attributed to the original tutor. If there is improper behavior or incorrect thinking due to the tutor's poor moral education, the original tutor should also be jointly responsible. (To be continued)

Qinghai Province has implemented compulsory education for those aged eight to sixteen since last year. Those who are over the age limit will be drafted. The provincial government plans to set up one primary school in each of the 25 counties in the province starting next year. The more problematic issues are teachers and textbooks. The primary school textbooks in the provincial capital are all handwritten. The spirit of the students' hard work is admirable.

### Education Briefs

The English and American Exchange Rates Continue to Fall, Hong Kong Banks Unceasingly Sell Off, HSBC's Appetite Wanes

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions saw no rise or fall in HSBC's listed prices. In the underground market, the Anglo-American exchange rate showed a relaxed trend that had persisted for days, with this trend only increasing. It is widely believed that the 5 pence mark for British gold and the 8 yuan mark for the US dollar will be easily broken in the near future. The day's trading began similarly to the previous day. Subsequently, Hong Kong banks, true to their usual style, started by heavily selling off. Only HSBC and a small number of other banks made purchases, so the rate slightly loosened at this point. Soon after, the Hong Kong banks continued to sell, and HSBC suddenly reversed its price to absorb the supply, causing the loosening trend to intensify. British gold reached 4 pence 6875, and the US dollar was at 7 yuan 8125. Unexpectedly, sellers then hesitated and stopped advancing. There was a period of calm until 11:30 AM, when Hong Kong banks sold again, and HSBC also stopped buying, causing the market to appear weak. Although Banque Belge pour l'Étranger and Banque Franco-Chinoise briefly supported the price, there were still two non-bank entities selling, so the hardest the US dollar reached was 7 yuan 875. In the end, British gold hardened further, reaching 4 pence 703125, while the US dollar closed at 7 yuan 84375. As for futures trading, although there were transactions, the trend was uniform. Half-day trading was quite active.

American Merchants Also Sold Yesterday

In the early morning, the London spot rate for short-term bills was up 3125, and the long-term rate was up 125. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London bullion remained steady. Exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar, Shanghai currency, and French franc were all flat. The US dollar against the British pound and Shanghai currency also showed no rise or fall, while the rate against the French franc was down slightly by 25. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the opening, banks' spot selling prices were 4 pence 609375 for British gold and 7 yuan 71875 for the US dollar, with no gains or losses compared to the previous closing. After the opening, Hong Kong Electric first sold, but while HSBC had an appetite, it was not as strong as the previous day, so the trend was hardening. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to HSBC and Banque Franco-Chinoise at 4 pence 625 and 65625. At the same time, exporters sold spot US dollars to a certain bank at 7 yuan 75. Soon after, a certain bank sold US dollar futures for November to another bank at 7 yuan 625. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be down by a small 2%. Later, Hong Kong Electric continued to sell spot British gold to HSBC at 4 pence 6875. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric and a certain bank sold spot US dollars to Banque Belge pour l'Étranger and Banque Franco-Chinoise at 7 yuan 8125. The process was hardening step by step. After that, no one was selling at the above prices, and the underlying trend was slightly stabilizing. However, after 11:30 AM, Hong Kong Electric sold again, and HSBC's appetite was minimal, causing the situation to loosen further. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to non-bank entities at 4 pence 703125, as well as spot US dollars at 7 yuan 84375 and 875. Subsequently, Chinese merchants sold US dollar futures for October to a certain bank at 7 yuan 75. Extending to the noon closing, banks' spot selling prices were 4 pence 703125 for British gold and 7 yuan 8375 for the US dollar. This month's and spot prices were the same. November British gold was at 4 pence 640625, and the US dollar was at 7 yuan 71875. In the end, compared to the previous day, the spot British pound was down by 09375, and the US dollar was up by 125. Half-day trading was quite active. Except for American merchants, other banks were all squeezing in. Chinese merchants and money changers had a slight appetite for the US dollar. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Hong Kong's Foreign Exchange Market is Quite Stable

Hong Kong, 21st – This morning, the foreign exchange market opened stably, with no movement in the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates. The Shanghai currency spot rate fell by 2 yuan to 320 yuan. There was no change in the quiet half-day.

Tianjin US Dollar Reaches Seven Yuan

Tianjin, 21st – Today, the foreign exchange market opened with a continued loosening.

The "Joint Notes" underground market was down by 1 yuan to 87 yuan.

### More Selling Than Buying, Gold Market Plunges, Breaking the 4,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's cash gold underground market conditions were calm for three days, but the loosening foreign exchange rate made the 4,000 yuan mark unsustainable. The lowest price once appeared at 3,965 yuan. The opening price of 4,000 yuan was still the highest price of the day. Subsequently, various banks heavily sold off, immediately dropping to 3,995 yuan. However, the Hong Kong banks and a certain gold company were still buying, so the decline was contained and pulled up by 4 yuan. But after that, the Hong Kong banks stopped buying, because Hong Kong ships had weighed anchor and temporarily suspended purchases, and because it was the end of the week, positions were even more abundant. As the loosening of foreign exchange rates was difficult to stop, there was more selling than buying, and the price fell further and further, reaching 3,966 yuan at closing. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday, but there were some transactions outside the market, with the price around 3,970 yuan. About 600 taels were traded in the half-day. Gold jewelry was listed at 5 yuan lower. Customs gold remained flat.

Gold Fell by 39 Yuan

From the morning, the initial foreign exchange rates loosened, and the market was weak. The market opened 5 yuan lower. Money changers sold 20 taels to jewelry stores at 4,000 yuan. Then it fell another 5 yuan, and money changers mutually traded 10 taels at 3,995 yuan. At that time, the Hong Kong banks absorbed about 100 taels, and gold companies also came to pull up the price, but at that time, the supply from various banks was quite good, so you were 4 yuan higher. A certain jewelry store bought 30 taels from Yu Hao at 3,999 yuan. After that, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate continued to harden, and the selling trend was even stronger. Jewelry stores rushed to sell, and a certain gold company also turned from buying to selling. Because the Hong Kong banks stopped buying, the market lacked support and began to decline. The market fell 22 yuan. Jewelry stores sold 20 taels to money changers at 3,977 yuan. Later, there was a slight pause. Gold companies bought 10 taels from money changers at 3,980 yuan. Around 11:30 AM, the foreign exchange rate hardened again, causing the selling trend to resurface. Money changers frequently sold, even lowering the price by 15 yuan. Money changers mutually traded 30 taels at 3,965 yuan. Later, money changers bought 20 taels from jewelry stores at 3,966 yuan as the noon closing price. In the end, it fell by 39 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 35 yuan in the half-day. The selling price of cash gold companies was 10 yuan higher than the cash gold, and the purchase price had to be reduced by about 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.

Jewelry Price Revised to 400 Yuan

Initially, major jewelry stores still listed gold jewelry for sale at 405 yuan per tael. By noon, it was listed 5 yuan lower. After that, there were no changes. Major jewelry stores revised the listed price to 400 yuan. New jewelry stores had the same price, and the purchase price was reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Decline Daily, US Dollar Notes Enter the 13 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's foreign currency market deteriorated further. This was because the foreign exchange rate loosened due to Hong Kong Electric's selling, the gold price suddenly fell below the 4,000 yuan mark, and the ever-present but elusive peace atmosphere suddenly became noisy again, making it even more difficult for people's minds to improve. As a result of yesterday's market, the British gold pound fell by 7 jiao, the US dollar pound fell by 2 yuan, the British gold note fell by 2 jiao, the US dollar note fell by 1 jiao 3 fen, the Hong Kong note fell by a small 5.5 fen, the Singapore note fell by 1 jiao, the Dutch note fell by 2 jiao, the Annam note fell by 8 fen, the Philippine note fell by 2 jiao, the Japanese remaining note fell by a small li, the Korean note fell by 1 fen, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Securities
The Domestic Debt Market is Gradually Rising

Although the securities underground market was weak in the morning, due to the buying and price-raising by many parties, there was a general follow-up in the later market opening, and the price was raised by 4 to 5 jiao. Yesterday's trading saw weakness in the morning and remained in a hovering state. The market was slightly stable at the closing. In the later market, the price had already been raised secretly, and the market price was gradually rising. The so-called peace atmosphere also took the opportunity to rise. The counter was narrow, and although it was difficult for many parties to raise prices, it was also not easy to lower prices. As a result, the market continued to rise by 3 to 4 jiao. Only the Ninety-Six was down by a small 1 jiao 5 fen. The total number of transactions was about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Transactions: China Bank held 40 shares, priced at 54 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen.

The Chinese and Western stock market conditions at the Public Concession were mixed, with varying prices. Trading was slightly thin due to the weekend. The recently soaring Deluge Phone stock once returned from 19 yuan to a small 17 yuan 3 jiao, with the final price at 18 yuan 2 jiao. Ewo Silk stock also fell slightly. China Reclamation and International Trust both rose slightly. Other stocks saw little change. Rubber stocks declined slightly due to weakened communications and profit-taking on many varieties.

London, 20th – Today's listed prices of British companies in the Far East saw mixed gains and losses in bank and rubber stocks. Mercantile Bank shares rose 2 shillings 6 pence to £7 5 shillings. HSBC shares fell by £1 each, with London-registered shares at £74 and London-registered shares at £75. Kula Clan rubber shares rose 5 pence to 16 shillings. The rest were flat.

London, 20th – Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained calm, with no changes in the upper and lower tranches of bonds.

### Cotton Yarn
Ten Count Coarse Yarn Continues to Fall by Ten Yuan

The yarn market, which had been falling for a week, showed a slightly stable trend yesterday. This was because some speculators believed that the price of 650 yuan had fallen enough to buy a few bales to make a profit or loss. If it fell again, they would buy more and pull it up. Once they had the opportunity to reverse the trend, they could avoid losing money. It was rumored that someone sold foreign exchange to buy cotton yarn, and another rumor said that money changers also came to speculate and buy a few bales. This temporary surge of wind temporarily suppressed the decline. However, merchants' minds were still depressed, and ships were not sailing, so traders were still taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, the market situation was slightly better, and it continued to rise after closing. However, the steps of decline were still large, and this kind of reversal was also reasonable.

The current yarn market opened in the morning with subdued momentum, and transactions were very rare. Ordinary people who specialized in grabbing the limelight saw the situation as scattered and had no chance to take advantage of it. They ate in the market and made trouble, but it was not until 10:00 AM that the market opened, and it fell another 11 yuan. The Double Horse price was 658 yuan. Soon after, it fell another 3 yuan, but the mid-range 20-count yarn Double Globe and Heavenly Maiden markets were still flat. Buying momentum rose slightly in the middle, saying that someone came to buy, and the market rose back. The closing price was 665 yuan, and the stack price was 654 yuan. It was found that half-day transactions totaled 1,155 bales, with the 20-count Feng Ma falling by 7 yuan, Heavenly Maiden rising by 1 yuan, and Double Globe remaining unchanged. However, 10-count coarse yarn fell by 10 yuan. Today, 20 pieces of yarn were shipped to Siam, 55 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 100 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount bought by each bank is listed on the left: Peers 12 Hong Kong 10 Mainland 60 Ningbo 20 Fuzhou 20 Jiangxi 30. Total 1,255.

### Cotton Prices Decline

Cotton trading has progressed slightly, but Chinese factories are still reluctant to buy, while Japanese factories have some needs and are just decorating the market. Therefore, the market is extremely weak. In fact, the yarn market is not working, so the raw cotton, which is dependent on it, is drawn into the vortex. As a result, the selling price is 1-2 yuan lower than the previous day. The source of Northern Jiangsu is still strong, with 2,560 bales of Tonghua arriving, and 370 bales of Beisha coming. Today, 110 bales were shipped to Xiamen and 590 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The situation of various cotton types is listed on the left: Tongzhou 134.00 Trade 300 bales Another 142.00 Shanghai 500 bales Jiading 140.00 Another 200 bales Tongzhou 132.00 Trade 200 bales Fire Machine 124.00 Another 200 bales

Another report: The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been particularly sluggish recently. Because the yarn price has not been able to recover, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Even Qingdao merchants are quiet about purchasing raw cotton. What factories hope for is that yarn sales can improve. Traders still have dozens of pieces of raw cotton in their hands, but they were all purchased and stored at high prices, so they are unwilling to sell at the current price. Combining the observations of all parties, this month is hopeless, and we must wait for a turnaround in yarn sales next month.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market initially surged due to purchases by overseas merchants, and domestic factories also had strong purchasing power due to the brisk sales of cloth. Later, the market situation suddenly turned weak due to a report of a decline from Bombay. Southern merchants also rushed to sell, and there were also sales among traders. Therefore, the closing was quite weak. As a result, the cotton price fell by 8 to 10 points from yesterday's market. India, including forecasts, fell by another 3 rupees. Egypt had little change, and Liverpool rose slightly by 2 pence.

### Grain
Due to Scarcity and Manipulation, Rice Prices Rise Again

The rice market seems to be in a hovering trend. After falling back due to abundant arrivals a few days ago, the market rebounded yesterday due to cold weather and scarcity. The opening bids were high, and local stores were eager to buy, and merchants from the inland also absorbed the supply. In general, out-of-town merchants were extremely supportive, and prices rose repeatedly. If the kiln-dried and Bai Ge varieties only arrived with one carload in the whole city, with only 120 to 130 bags, which was a rare commodity and even more outstanding, the market was sold out quickly as buyers competed with each other. The price increased repeatedly, and the market was immediately sold out. The closing price was 31.30 yuan to 31 yuan, which was a huge increase of 1-2 yuan compared to the previous market. The Juexin glutinous rice market had more goods, but after falling to the bottom, the price seemed cheap. And once the weather turned cold, the body could immediately become firmer and more sustainable. Therefore, out-of-town merchants were unwilling to sell, and as a result, the price also increased by 0.5 yuan to nearly 1 yuan. The prices of broken and old new rice also increased by about 0.5 yuan, but the route was still not wide. However, in the current wind of rising prices, the price also increased by about 0.5 yuan. Lu Yang Jian was the same. As for Kejian, although it was heard that a certain foreign firm continued to launch the product, the market had tightened once before noon, and people were generally optimistic. Therefore, the morning wholesale and retail markets were very active, and each price continued to rise by 0.5 yuan. By noon, the owners believed that the price could not rise any further, and they rushed to sell, resulting in the market being filled with goods. The market was dull, and people began to be pessimistic. The total number of transactions in the day was 7,000 to 8,000 bags.

Another report: The supply of Ke Xian from Jiangbei and other sources was scarce yesterday, and not a single bag of Wan Xian, which was handled by Japanese merchants, was sold. Local villages were already interested in buying due to the continuous price declines, and the market was tense. However, after the active morning market, the afternoon and evening markets were more cautious, and the market remained flat. However, the transactions in the morning were not withdrawn in the afternoon, and the market price still increased by about 0.5 yuan.

### Flour Speculators Sell Off

The Price of Goods in Transfer Stations is the Same as That of Factory Prices

Yesterday's flour trade was flat. Because it was the weekend, manufacturers were unwilling to sell much for days, and the supply of round cage goods on the market also felt scarce, so customers felt lazy and loose. The market was stagnant, and the general small-scale speculators intended to sell. It was heard that the price of goods in transfer stations was the same as that of factory prices, which was a little looser than before. However, the price of foreign flour still had to be 8.12 yuan due to the lack of stock. The total number of transactions in the market was less than 30,000 bags, and the market changes had to wait until the beginning of next week. Today, 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat: Yesterday's supply was still not much. The sellers were unwilling to loosen the price, but the factories felt that the price was too high, and they were cautious. As a result, the transaction was sparse. The total number of sales in the market was only 400 bags of Wuxi wheat, 10.03 yuan, and 3 carloads of Suzhou wheat, 10.06 yuan, all of which were handled by flour mills.

### Silk and Tea
Raw Silk Prices Rise Sharply, Local Trading Becomes Thin

The silk market abroad, Yokohama, is still rising sharply. The morning price for spot goods was 1,860 yuan, up 60 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 1,900 yuan, up another 40 yuan. The price for forward goods was 1,810 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 1,858 yuan. Although the New York silk price fell, the spot price did not move. The short-term price fell by 6 cents, and the long-term price fell by a small 7 cents. The Shanghai silk market was also relatively weak. The price for White Factory 78 was 4,700 yuan, and the price for Chi Li was 2,300 yuan. Although there were transactions, foreign firms were no longer interested, and buyers' emotions seemed to have turned harsh. Therefore, the underground silk market trended down in the afternoon. It seems that high prices are no longer available, and general hoarders do not want to miss this opportunity to sell their goods. It is estimated that 110 loads were traded yesterday.

### Piece Goods
Eastern Piece Goods Plunge, Stockpiles Flow Out, Traders Collect Slightly

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the trading of cotton cloth on this street and by Wenzhou merchants gradually became active. This was because the Shanghai-Wenzhou stations had the hope of resuming shipping soon, and customers started to buy. In addition, the market had been weak for a long time, and stockpiles were being sold at surprisingly low prices. Some traders took advantage of the low prices, but because the price of cloth was falling too sharply for Eastern piece goods, buyers and sellers were at a standstill. The selling price of small amounts of domestic goods was still falling, and the market was extremely chaotic. White goods fell by 5 cents to 5 jiao, and colored cloths and colored twills fell by 3 to 5 jiao. Nobody asked about miscellaneous brand blue cloths even if they were priced more than 1 yuan lower than the market. Light-colored bleached fine yarn goods for spring sales were relatively stable. Traders on this street bought more than 500 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, velvet cloth, bleached printed goods, etc. Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants bought more than 200 pieces of Ewo coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Guangdong merchants bought more than 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, velvet cloth, etc. Merchants from Southeast Asia and Hong Kong also bought nearly 200 pieces.

Eastern Piece Goods: The market atmosphere was bleak, and new low prices were being set repeatedly. In the morning market, Dragon Head fine cloth fell to (per piece) 18.60 yuan, and Four Gentlemen serge fell sharply to 0.625 yuan. Because the decline was too sharp in the later market, Japanese merchants bought 100-odd bales of Dragon Head, and traders on this street with bullish sentiment also took advantage of the low prices. More than 300 bales of fine cloth were traded, and 400-500 boxes of serge were traded. The selling market then rose slightly. The spot price of Dragon Head rose to 18.75 yuan, and the asking price for serge was 0.605 yuan to 0.6075 yuan per yard. The supply of Four Gentlemen straight tribute goods was relatively low, and most sellers were unwilling to sell at a low price. The market price was 0.6 yuan.

Exports: Today, 215 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 125 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 100 pieces were shipped to Tule, and 155 pieces were shipped to Siam.

### Sugar Market
Imported Sugar Down Another 1-2 Yuan

Yesterday, there was no change in the foreign sugar market, according to foreign reports. The trend of the market prices set by the local guild was still weak. Stockpilers were also selling off, and the decline was alarming. The price of coarse white sugar 24 was 55 yuan, down 2.5 yuan. The price of outside station 56 yuan to 56 yuan 8 jiao, down 2 yuan to 1.2 yuan. The price of transit cargo was 45 yuan, down 1 yuan. The price of Taikoo Cart White was down 2 yuan to 1.5 yuan, with the B mark at 59.5 yuan to 60 yuan, the GW mark at 59.5 yuan, the GX mark at 59 yuan, the DJ mark at 57.5 yuan, and the HX mark at 57 yuan. The price of H mark Cart Red was 42.5 yuan, and the Dutch Red was 43.5 yuan, both down 1 yuan. The price of local cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 55-57 yuan, No. 2 was 56.5 yuan, No. 3 was 56 yuan, and No. 4 was 55.5 yuan. The price of local No. 1 ice sugar was 68.5 yuan, and the price of Jingming ice sugar was 70 yuan, both down 1.5 yuan. The local sugar market was still weak and there was no continued opening.

### Coal
Coal Balls Drop Steadily, Small Factory Goods Fall Another Two Yuan

Since the raw material Hongji arrived in large quantities, the price of coal balls has rebounded from 84 yuan at the peak to 70.2 yuan and 68 yuan, steadily declining. Because users had hoarded enough coal to prevent shortages in the previous month, the shop's business had no desire to buy. Small factory goods were even more sluggish. Therefore, the underground price fell by another two yuan the other day, but large factories such as Nanyang and Yitaixing still kept the original price. Traders sent it to customers at 70.05 yuan per ton, and customers retailed it at 3.8 yuan per load.

### Dried and Fresh Produce
Round Meat and Cassia Twig, New Market Prices Have Been Opened

The first batch of Tong'an new cassia twigs, yesterday, the large granules had a market price that was more than 20 yuan higher than the old goods, but it had not yet become a market. The new sun-dried round meat was opened at 1523 yuan, and the new Lianzhou round meat was 175 yuan.

### Metals
American Bar Iron Gradually Enters a Weak Path, White Lead Skin Customer Sales Move Slightly

American Bar Iron: The market situation has recently re-entered a weak path. The only customers who rely on it are local canneries and toy factories. However, recently those factories have no intention of buying. As a result, the sales market has been greatly affected. Currently, the market is only for small factories and retail customers. Therefore, the opening price is slightly reduced. The current market price is 110 yuan per box (based on the system's color), but the asking price for large single-hanging sizes is still 1178 yuan to more than 120 yuan per box.

White Lead Skin: Yesterday, the transaction suddenly flourished, and there were many inquiries in the market. Fuzhou merchants bought 30 barrels, and Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao and other merchants searched for nearly 100 barrels. As a result, the market was lively. The standard, such as thin color, sells for 800 yuan per barrel, medium-grade goods sell for 760-770 yuan per barrel, and thick color must be over 800 yuan per barrel.

### Grains
Large Quantities of Oil Beans Shipped to South China

Today (22nd), a large number of Miscellaneous Grains and Shandong Beans will be shipped to Hong Kong. The calculations are: 430 bags of Sorghum, 1230 bags of raw peanuts, 500 bags of peanuts, 2370 bags of Soybeans, 1245 tins of raw oil, 350 bags of Sesame seeds, and 500 tins of Sesame oil. Separately there will be 380 bags of Soybeans, 590 tins of Soybean oil to be shipped to Xiamen. Only 1000 pieces of bean cakes are shipped to Siam.

### America States a Strong Policy, Shanghai Situation Immediately Changes, Hull's Speech Broadcasts an Excitement to the People, Concession Authorities Attitude Changes to an Active Stance, It's Rumored that Direct Negotiations Will Commence Next Week

The Shanghai Concession's position has been under threat from the Japanese. Ever since the start of the European War, the Japanese have supported the false police overstepping their bounds in the Huaxi regions, publicly establishing false police stations, sending false police armed marches, encroaching on police patrol positions, directing rioters, resolving robberies and seizing the Police's firearms, an escalation of events. The evening before last, at six fifty, it was planned to assault police patrols, causing both Chinese and Indian police officers a death and an injury. Especially to the foreign nations' interests connected to the Concession, these incidents have invoked extreme unease, causing them to take resolute actions in order to protect the life and property of both Chinese and foreigners. News spread yesterday that British soldiers have been sent to defend the overstepped border road regions, the diplomatic group has abandoned appeasement policies towards the Japanese false authorities, and is separately considering strong hand procedures. The American government has stated that it will assist the Bureau of Public Works in taking appropriate actions. Because of this, the hearts of the Shanghai people are greatly relieved, it is anticipated that the lawless behavior perpetrated by the Japanese false authorities may give rise to a serious end result. The following will separately record the details gathered yesterday.

### Hull States that Cooperation is United

American Associated Press dispatched by Chang Wei'erxun Washington 21st Electric, State Secretary Hull, announced last night that the American Government intends to unite in cooperation with the Shanghai Bureau of Public Works, to resolve all kinds of incident. Just like the armed assault on the Bureau of Public Works police patrols in the overstepped border road regions last night. Hull proclaimed that the Bureau of Public Works is to determine the course of action, in order to resolve the incident, American officials stationed in Shanghai are extremely attentive to the incident, and are "uniting in cooperation to resolve the matter." Observers viewed that Hull spoke of "uniting in cooperation," which signified that the United States is prepared to respond to requests from the Bureau of Public Works to use arms to protect life and property of the American people in the overstepped border road regions, recently "Da Dao" police under Japanese management had intruded. Hull's communique is a restatement of the American Government's support of the Shanghai Bureau of Public Works efforts to protect the rights and interests of the overstepped border road regions and resist Japanese pressures to change the status of the Shanghai Public Concession.

### America Takes a Strong Policy

However people that have access to news claim that to this day the State Department has not received any request for intervention by the government by American people whose lives and property have been endangered by "Da Dao" police intrusion into the overstepped border road regions. People that have access to news, view Bureau of Public Work's Director-General Fan Keling issuing a warning of the intention to petition the American Marine Corps to protect the life and property of the American people in the overstepped border road regions where the "Da Dao" police has intruded, this warning being a new indication that America is taking a more firm stance in the Far East. Washington observers are making a comparison of the communication made by Fan Keling and the open speech made in Tokyo by the American Ambassador to Japan, Gelu, this week.

### Fan Keling's Firm Attitude

Mr. Franklin, an American citizen, told the Japanese that the American people understand the "New Order in East Asia" as the Japanese people do, but the American people oppose it because this measure seems to deprive the American people of their rights and interests in the Far East. Mr. Franklin's statement was issued after one Chinese constable of the Shanghai Municipal Council was shot and killed by thugs in the extraterritorial road area, and one Indian constable was seriously injured. Mr. Franklin stated that if American people residing in the extraterritorial road area need protection, he will request the US government to provide such protection. Mr. Franklin declared, "As far as I am concerned, we cannot abandon the foreign residents residing in the extraterritorial road area who should be protected by the Municipal Council."

Wholehearted Assistance to the Shanghai Municipal Council

Observers here point out that Mr. Franklin's statement is one of the most resolute attitudes publicly expressed by a Municipal Council official since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Some people believe that Mr. Franklin's firm statement will definitely lead the US government to assist the Shanghai Municipal Council in the issue of tax revenue and police power in the extraterritorial road area. US diplomatic actions in the Far East have shown a tough stance since the outbreak of the war in Europe. Some people believe that the reason why the United States has adopted a tough attitude is partly to protect its own rights in China, and partly because Britain and France are fighting in Europe and have no time to take care of the Far East. Since the outbreak of the European war, the United States has strengthened the defense of its Asian fleet in the Philippines. People who know the situation well believe that the US Far East policy has not changed, but it has now adopted more resolute actions.

### Direct Negotiations to be Held Next Week

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that after reporters interviewed key officials of the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government today (the 21st), it is expected that the two sides will hold direct negotiations next week to resolve various disputes between the two authorities, including the long-pending issue of extraterritorial roads. Although the two sides are still in a deadlock after holding preliminary informal discussions on March 23 this year, reporters still believe that the two sides will hold direct negotiations. The discussion on March 23 was held by Mayor Chuan Xiaoan and Mr. Fessenden, the former Director-General of the Municipal Council, at the Broadway Building. It was not until the beginning of last month that Mr. Phillips, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, met with Chuan Xiaoan in

The City Center

and fell into a new deadlock. However, according to an announcement last week that the Municipal Council has applied to the Consular Body for mediation in this matter, as a result, the Japanese Consulate authorities in this city were consulted and requested to provide assistance. It is heard that after many efforts by the Japanese authorities, there is now hope for an early solution to the problems between the two sides. At the same time, it is heard from reliable sources that the Special Municipal Government may submit

Suggestions Prepared

to the Consular Body within a few days, which will require the complete management of the western district by the Chinese authorities as the basis for recovering the extraterritorial roads, and the Municipal Government will reimburse all expenses incurred by the Public Concession in the construction, repair, and special construction of roads in the area. In addition, the expenses incurred by water, telephone, and electricity companies in the area

Expenses Incurred

will also be considered. Previously, Mayor Yu Hongjun had negotiated with Mr. Fessenden, the former Director-General of the Municipal Council, on the issue of extraterritorial road construction for several years, but there were no shooting incidents or terrorist acts against Public Concession police officers during this period. The two sides finally agreed on tentative terms, stipulating the organization of a special joint management agency for extraterritorial roads, with a Chinese person as the director, recommended by the Municipal Council and appointed by the Chinese government, and a foreigner as the deputy director. However, this solution to

Outstanding Issues

was sabotaged by the Japanese, because the new management agency would completely control North Sichuan Road starting from Bazilu, and the Japanese felt that their "sphere of influence" would be affected. It is believed that this plan would affect the strategic value of the expanding Japanese Marine Corps barracks at that time,

Had a Considerable Impact

Therefore, the Japanese strongly opposed it. Due to Japan's refusal to approve this plan, the talks between Yu Hongjun and Fessenden were temporarily suspended. After the outbreak of the war, the Chinese army withdrew, Yu resigned, and Fessenden also retired. This plan had to be abandoned.

### News Arrives, All of Shanghai Rejoices

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that Shanghai received news this morning (the 21st) and learned that the US government has guaranteed to assist the Municipal Council in resolving incidents such as the death and injury of one police officer in the area that the Dadao authorities are trying to seize, which occurred last night, and is rejoicing. Discussions focused on the remarks made by US Secretary of State Hull to cooperate with the Municipal Council. Reporters visited Mr. Franklin, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, this morning, who said that the words of the US Secretary of State are

Extremely Appreciated

He has not yet had time to discuss the new developments with the directors of the Municipal Council and the US authorities. In any case, this can indicate that the lives and property of American residents in the extraterritorial road area will be protected. Mr. Franklin said last night (the 20th) that if American people residing in the extraterritorial road area need protection, he will request the US government to provide

This Kind of Protection

The American community was very pleased to hear the news, and the rumor that the US Marine Corps will be deployed to protect the many lives and large amounts of property of American residents in the area is spreading. However, the general feeling is that since the area is a British defense zone, the initial protection should be the responsibility of the British army, because the British and American defense forces obviously cannot only protect the citizens of their own countries in the entire Public Concession. Therefore, the areas were originally assigned to

Troops Stationed by Various Countries

for defense, and each was responsible for taking care of the people of all countries in these areas. Many people feel that the British troops stationed in Shanghai have failed to adequately protect their defense zone, and the blame does not lie with the British troops themselves, but with the British government. This point seems to be what the American community in this city regrets. However, when needed, the Americans will not hesitate to lend a helping hand to the British. Regarding assisting the police department,

British Foreign Secretary

Halifax's failure to make any statement on the situation in the Shanghai slum area was severely criticized in this city this morning. Speakers said that the British Foreign Secretary has forgotten the existence of Shanghai. As for the US Marine Corps entering our British defense zone, no news has been received as of this afternoon. However, at the same time, the two overworked British army battalions stationed in Shanghai have dispatched many patrols to assist in view of the sudden shooting of police officers.

### Mr. Franklin's Letter Requests the Attention of the Consular Body

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that after one Chinese constable of the police department was killed and one Indian constable was injured last night (the 20th), the military immediately deployed sentry posts beside the traffic signals at various intersections along Yuyuan Road this morning (the 21st). Mr. Franklin, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, decided to pay attention to the accident today. It is heard that Mr. Franklin's letter will point out that this incident is an example of the current

Serious Situation

in the extraterritorial road area and will formally summarize the incident. Soldiers of the British East Surrey Regiment were deployed this morning, and two sentries were stationed next to each traffic signal and intersection in the area. According to some sources, the "Special Municipal Government" is eager to take over complete management of the traffic signals in the extraterritorial road area, which is the motive for last night's shooting. It is also said that in August, "Special Municipal Government" police officers were shot by Public Concession constables near the scene of last night's shooting, killing and injuring three people,

Seeking Revenge

As a result, this shooting incident occurred. This morning, the East Surrey Regiment continued to send British soldiers to guard along the roads in the western district, and special patrols continued to patrol back and forth. Recently, the number of "Special Municipal Government" police officers on the extraterritorial roads has gradually increased, but these police officers were not seen in the western district all morning today. The police department is still conducting investigations this morning, so it has not issued a formal report on last night's incident. The number of thugs involved in the case could not be confirmed this morning. It is said that the

Gang of Thugs

numbered three to five people. The injured Indian constable is still in the hospital for treatment this morning, and it is believed that his injuries are not very serious. Also, the British army began building two sandbag fortifications at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road and Daxilu today, and will permanently station troops in them. British Army Commander Simmons presented flowers to the injured Indian constable today and attached a note congratulating his spirit of bravery.

### Strict Precautions on the Borders of the Concession

The western border of the Public Concession looks like an area under attack, heavily armored and ready for anything, to prevent any eventuality. Soldiers and detectives from various countries, all fully armed, are densely deployed everywhere. Reporters from Da Zhong News Agency inspected the area last night and saw that the puppet police in the extraterritorial road area were very frightened, and their every move was mostly subservient to the Japanese military police. The British East Surrey Regiment was walking on the sidewalks, busily

Building Sandcastles

A British army unit, fully armored, patrolled in the middle of the road. A red armored car equipped with a Thompson submachine gun, managed by the police detectives, was stationed at the thoroughfare. The detectives carried rifles and revolvers, and were ready to act. The tension in the air was unprecedented. There were no fewer than 500 puppet police officers on both sides of Yuyuan Road, one post every ten yards, from Difeng Road to Jingwei's residence. This kind of demonstration deployment has other reasons. It is said that the Japanese army

Major General Itagaki

visited Wang yesterday. The puppet police, under the command of the Japanese military police, appeared on Yuyuan Road at 1:30 p.m. yesterday. An hour later, 20 cars quickly passed through, one of which was guarded by four motorcycles, and the horns honked in unison. Itagaki entered Wang's residence at this time. Two hours later, the car formation returned along the same route, and the puppet police also removed the special deployment, leaving the usual number at the traffic posts at each intersection, facing the concession police in

Dual Post Confrontation

When the reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inspected yesterday, he discovered a very interesting contrast. The attendants and guards of Major General Itagaki were so strict when he went out, while Major General Simmons, the commander of the British defense forces, inspected the extraterritorial road area alone yesterday, supervising the construction of sandcastle projects by British soldiers, with only one unarmed chauffeur accompanying him. Major Arthur Ashmore of the British Army went to the extraterritorial road area for inspection yesterday morning and ordered the British army to be at the southwest corner of Yidingpan Road and Daxilu, and the northeast corner of Yidingpan Road,

Build a Sandcastle

A sandcastle was built, and soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment were ordered to start work immediately and did not finish until dusk. The company soldiers are now stationed there, and there are more than 200 concession police officers performing duties in the extraterritorial road area. The deployment at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Daxilu and Yuyuan Road is even tighter, because the puppet municipal government has repeatedly threatened the traffic posts at these two locations, and the attack on the concession police occurred on the evening of the 20th.

### Phillips' Solemn Attitude

The North China Daily News reported that reporters visited Mr. Phillips, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, last night (the 20th), and he made the following remarks: The cowardly attack on the police department constables last night will shock Shanghai and the governments of all countries with expatriates in China. The extraterritorial roads in the western district were built and maintained by the Municipal Council, and the police department has been in charge of police affairs for many years. The Municipal Council has spent huge sums of money to develop this western district, and as a result, the western district has become an orderly and well-managed area. The Municipal Council has never recognized the Chinese sovereignty over the land on which the extraterritorial roads are built, and is always prepared to engage in reasonable discussions on any constructive suggestions regarding police affairs and tax revenue in the western district. In the past, the Chinese administrative authorities did not attempt to forcibly drive the Municipal Council's power out of this area by force, but today the Municipal Council is threatened by force, causing serious threats to law and order. Shanghai is an international neutral city with a unique status, and this status can only be maintained with the support of various countries. The Municipal Council is not a sovereign state, but a municipal organization representing the interests of all countries with expatriates in Shanghai. The Municipal Council is today threatened by those who seem to disregard the rights and interests established by the years of efforts of various countries in the western district. The Municipal Council trusts in world public opinion and the assistance of various countries.

### Mr. Franklin's Statement: No Concessions

Mr. Franklin, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, issued a statement the night before last, stating in affirmative terms, "The Municipal Council will not make any concessions on its rights and interests in the extraterritorial roads. We cannot disregard the expatriates in the area who enjoy the protection of the Municipal Council." Mr. Franklin also stated that if American residents residing in the extraterritorial road area need appropriate protection, the US government should send troops to protect them. When asked by reporters whether this would allow the US Marine Corps to patrol in the extraterritorial road area, Mr. Franklin replied that if there is such a need and the US Navy is requested to patrol in the area, it can be done, but only to protect the rights and interests of Americans. As for other foreigners, they can only rely on their own governments. Reporters also asked what methods the Municipal Council would use to prevent its rights and interests in the extraterritorial roads from being expelled. Mr. Franklin stated that he cannot announce it now, because the Municipal Council has not yet found a clear and visible method to protect its rights and interests.

### After the Defeat in the War of Aggression Against China, Japan Will Stake Everything, The Entire Japanese Navy's Third Fleet is Mobilized, Nishio Shigeru is the Commander-in-Chief of All Japanese Forces in China

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that according to reliable sources, Japan may send its entire navy to participate in the Sino-Japanese War in accordance with its recent plan to end the war as soon as possible. Nishio's recent promotion to Commander-in-Chief of all Japanese forces in China, and the appointment of former Japanese Army Minister Itagaki as Deputy Commander-in-Chief, is part of a larger plan to strengthen military power and establish closer contact among the Japanese forces currently fighting in China. After the Japanese army was transferred, it was expected that the Japanese navy would continue to send warships to participate in the war. According to news about the possible transfer of the Japanese navy in China, the Japanese Third Fleet, which is currently engaged in all Japanese naval activities in China, will be transferred to North China, the First Fleet currently berthed in Japan will sail to Central China, and the Second Fleet will carry out activities in South China.

### Japan Occupies the Bank of Communications Building, Will Submit a Negotiation, The Bank of Communications Asks the Municipal Council to Consult with the Japanese Side for Return

The Continental News reported that according to news from financial circles here yesterday (the 20th), the staff of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications have received instructions from the Chongqing Head Office to submit a request to the Municipal Council to consult with the Japanese side for the return of the occupied bank property. According to reports, the bank property was forcibly occupied by the Japanese military police a week ago after they failed to rent a portion of it. The occupied area includes four or five two-story buildings, which have been converted into Japanese military police dormitories. Although the bureau has consulted with the Japanese side, it has not yet been able to recover the two-story buildings. At the same time, the bank continues to operate in the last two floors of the building, using the main entrance facing the Bund for access.

### Tram Tickets Gradually Recovered, After the Issuance of the Second Batch of Subsidiary Coins, the Two Concessions Should Restrict Exit

After the Bank of China issued the first batch of 500,000 yuan of subsidiary coins, because citizens hoarded them and some flowed into the occupied areas, the market was still insufficient. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Central Bank yesterday, requesting that the second batch of 500,000 yuan be issued as soon as possible, so that the problem of the shortage of small coins in Shanghai could be completely resolved. The Federation also sent separate letters to the tram companies in the two concessions, requesting that the temporary substitute coin tickets issued be recalled within a limited time, so that the transitional state of the lack of small coins can be a thing of the past as soon as possible. It is understood that the tram three-cent tickets are being recalled and invalidated by the company, but they can still be used on the market and are scheduled to be extended to the 20th of next month. The total amount of tram tickets issued is extremely large, reportedly nearly 700,000 yuan. Therefore, after the issuance of the second batch of subsidiary coins, if they are allowed to flow out of the special district, it is still feared that they will not be enough for the market.

### Delay in Loading and Unloading of Goods from Ningbo Due to Wind, Many Ship Schedules Have Been Changed, and Incoming Goods Are Extremely Rare

Since the Ministry of Finance ordered that export goods on the Shanghai-Ningbo line must be settled in foreign exchange, the number of goods coming from Ningbo has decreased sharply. Therefore, each ship only has outgoing goods and no incoming goods, and the ship schedule should be shortened as usual. However, due to the recent hurricane in the Nanyang area, the loading and unloading of goods has been delayed. The Haida, Moufu, Yongtai and other ships that were supposed to arrive on the 16th and 17th have not yet arrived in Shanghai. It is now heard that the Haida ship can arrive in Shanghai this morning and will depart for Ningbo tomorrow. In addition to carrying passengers, no cargo will be loaded, because the ship must go to Nanyang after going to Ningbo. The company has now changed the tonnage reserved for the Haida ship by various customs brokers to be loaded and transported to Ningbo by the Dabu ship, which will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 24th. Jardine Matheson's Moufu ship will return to Shanghai on the 24th and will depart for Ningbo on the 26th and 27th. Jardine Matheson's Yongtai Maller will also return to Shanghai within days and continue to sail to Ningbo.

### Shanghai Confirms Mutiny of Japanese Troops in Hankou, Thirteen Killed by Shooting Before it Was Suppressed, Wounded Japanese Soldiers All Boarded Ships at Night

The Continental News reported that the news of the mutiny of Japanese troops in Hankou two months ago was confirmed yesterday (the 20th) by a well-known foreigner and an official of a local consulate who had just arrived in Shanghai from Hankou. According to the actual situation, the two Japanese divisions stationed in Hankou for a long time were increasingly dissatisfied with the ineffective and prolonged war, resulting in several small teams openly rebelling and refusing to obey orders. The Japanese authorities executed thirteen Japanese soldiers by shooting before it was suppressed. One of the divisions was immediately transferred from Hankou, and it is believed that another division was sent to participate in the recent Battle of Changsha. Even foreigners residing in Hankou are very difficult to obtain news, because their movements are restricted and the Japanese side's inspection is relentless. For example, Japanese wounded soldiers have never been seen transported in the streets of Hankou, but medical ships sailing to Hankou are obviously endless, because wounded and sick Japanese soldiers are transported and boarded the ships at night, and the medical ships must also sail out at night. The morale of the Chinese people in Hankou is almost openly patriotic. The most important topic of their daily conversations is that the Chinese army will soon re-enter Hankou.

### After the Disappearance of Yuan Ying, All Sectors Care, Safety Can Be Assured, Rescue is Quite Difficult

Since Master Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was kidnapped from the Yuanming Lecture Hall at 443 Daxilu, the Datong News Agency contacted the Buddhist Association on Hedelu and the Yuanming Lecture Hall again yesterday morning, but has not yet learned of his whereabouts. Although there are records in foreign newspapers that he was detained at the Japanese military police headquarters at 94 Jules Garnier Road in western Shanghai, the Buddhist community does not believe it, because his daily behavior is not enough to provoke jealousy from the Japanese side. It is understood that when Yuan Ying was in Singapore, in addition to raising funds for the Chinese Buddhist Association, he also raised donations for Chinese refugees. All these measures are the true colors of monks, inseparable from compassion as the foundation. The Buddhist Association and his friends believe that his safety can be assured, but it is difficult to say whether he can be released quickly.

### The Purpose of Sniping Shanghai's Western Police is to Seize Traffic Posts, The Municipal Council Does Not Intend to Protest Yet, It is Definitely Proven That the Murderer is a Puppet Police

The North China Daily News reported that at 6:44 p.m. yesterday (the 20th), a Chinese constable of the police department at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road was shot and killed on the spot by two plainclothes thugs, and an Indian constable was seriously injured. The three thugs were walking along Yidingpan Road from the south, approaching Indian constable No. 459. Two of them suddenly grabbed the Indian constable's hands and twisted them behind his back, ordering him not to move. The third person stood three feet away, holding a Mauser pistol and pointing it directly at the Indian constable. The Indian constable tried to break free, and one of the thugs ordered the third person to shoot. A bullet was fired, entering the Indian constable's right chest. The three thugs then tried to escape, and in order to escape safely, they shot and killed Chinese constable No. 3378, who was standing on the upper right side. The armed police of the "Special Municipal Government" stationed there immediately fled as fast as they could when they heard the gunshots, and did not provide any assistance to the outnumbered police department constables. This is the most audacious attempt to coerce police department personnel that has rarely occurred in the western district, and is entirely provocative in nature. As a result of the shooting incident, a large number of constables and British soldiers from the East Surrey Regiment patrolled the vicinity of the area to prevent unfortunate events from recurring.

Regarding the attack on the Chinese and Indian constables on the extraterritorial road post on the evening of the 10th, Mr. Phillips, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, said yesterday (the 21st) that the bureau does not intend to protest yet and is not considering it? It is too early to believe that the criminals in this case must be related to the puppet police. Now, based on the evidence obtained from the investigation, it can be definitely concluded. "According to the reporter from Da Zhong News Agency, the police department of the concession learned of the assault from a few eyewitnesses from the police department, the investigation department was able to gather some leads from the victims of the incident.

Thugs Commit Murder, Puppet Police Escape

Before the incident, the Indian constable was managing the traffic lights, while the victimized Chinese constable was one of the three Chinese constables stationed on the northwest side of the intersection. The Indian constable was shot in the chest, but fortunately it did not enter the lungs, but came out from the other side. Although he was injured, he resolutely continued to manage the traffic. At that time, an Englishman named Crane, an employee of the Shanghai Power Company, was near the scene of the incident and ran to the Indian constable. The Indian constable only said, "I was shot twice." The Big Indian constable already knew that he had two injuries, but did not understand that it was a bullet that had passed through. After the three thugs committed the murder, they fled north along Yidingpan Road. The "Special Municipal Government" police stationed diagonally across the street, far from adding rescue, but fled away, and did not reappear at the scene until twenty minutes later. The police reserve team, upon hearing the news, departed from the Jing'an Temple police station, carrying Thompson submachine guns, and drove quickly to the scene a few minutes later. Chief Patrol Bowen, Deputy Chief Patrol Smith, Assistant Chief Patrol Sampson, and Dirk all stood by to personally supervise the investigation.

Police Authorities Keep Silent

Late last night, police department personnel refused to make any statements regarding the shooting incident and the uncaptured criminals. However, there seems to be little doubt as to who the criminals are. It must be remembered that on October 13, a large number of "Special Municipal Government" police forcibly took over the traffic light posts at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road and Daxilu. After a long negotiation, they were finally driven away. It is also heard that the "Special Municipal Government" police bureau indirectly announced that they would take over the two traffic posts on Monday, but it failed because the police department took precautions. The police department heard on Wednesday that the "Special Municipal Government" would make an effort to take over the two intersections on Thursday morning, so it took strong precautions again, and no accidents occurred. Therefore, last night's shooting incident can only be regarded as a direct attempt to coerce the constables stationed at the location in order to take it over. There is no question of police department constables firing their guns now, because when the Chinese and Indian constables were carried into the ambulance, their pistols were still in their bags.

Armored Cars Guard and Precaution

The thugs used Mauser pistols. According to eyewitnesses, the "Special Municipal Government" police had left the scene a few minutes before the incident. However, this statement could not be officially confirmed. After the cowardly shooting incident, special precautions were immediately taken in the area. In addition to calling out all the reserve team constables, two armored cars were stationed at the intersection. In addition to the numerous constables stationed, the British army authorities also dispatched a large number of patrols to patrol the extraterritorial roads. It was heard last night that armored cars would be stationed at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road, and the intersection of Daxilu and Yidingpan Road today, to prevent the "Special Municipal Government" police from making any further attempts to forcibly interfere with the two traffic posts.

### Sharp Decline in Imports of Foreign Goods; Shanghai Customs Turns into a Trade Surplus; Brisk Exports and Increased Sales to the U.S. Indicate Overall Improvement in Trade

Following the Ministry of Finance's all-out efforts to adjust foreign trade, customs offices in the Southwest have now shifted to trade surpluses. However, the Shanghai Customs, located in the occupied area, still shows a trade deficit, ranking first among all customs offices. Since the outbreak of the European War, trade with China by Britain, France, and Germany has been significantly impacted due to shipping issues. Consequently, imports through the Shanghai Customs have sharply declined, while exports, driven by robust sales to the U.S., have seen an increase. In September, the Shanghai Customs turned into a trade surplus, amounting to 17,894,164 national currency units. This situation represents a significant improvement in China's trade. The import and export trade figures for the Shanghai Customs in September are detailed below:

Imported Foreign Goods

Cotton, yarn, and thread, with a net value of 18,127,931 national currency units; Candles, soap, oils, wax, and rosin, totaling 4,230,875 units; Metals and mineral ores, amounting to 3,525,956 units; Coal, fuel, asphalt, and coal tar, totaling 3,287,956 units; Wool and its products, amounting to 2,820,183 units; Chemical products and pharmaceuticals, totaling 2,139,346 units; Books, maps, paper, and wooden paper products, amounting to 1,873,436 units; Dyes, pigments, paints, and varnish, totaling 1,897,783 units; Grand total valued at 48,816,916 national currency units.

Exported Native Goods

Animals and animal products, valued at 10,180,100 national currency units; Textile fibers, totaling 19,247,145 units; Yarn, woven goods, and knitted products, amounting to 9,857,659 units; Piece goods, totaling 8,236,600 units; Sundries, amounting to 3,278,811 units; Other textiles, totaling 2,417,827 units; Mineral ores, metals, and metal products, amounting to 2,149,648 units; Grains and their products, totaling 2,143,147 units; Tea, totaling 1,909,706 units; Grand total valued at 66,711,080 national currency units.

Turning into a Trade Surplus

The total value of imports and exports in September was 115,527,996 national currency units, resulting in a surplus of 17,894,164 units. Compared to August, imports decreased by 16,637,332 units, and exports increased by 5,500,211 units. Imports decreased by approximately 24.56%, while exports increased by approximately 9.94%. The trade surplus for October is expected to be even higher than in September. This situation is beneficial to China's war of resistance, reversing the adverse trend in China's trade and balancing international income.

### The Design of Daily Necessities Should Include Anti-Japanese War Significance

The Political Department of the National Military Council recently sent a letter to the Ministry of Interior, instructing administrative inspectors in various provinces to ensure that the decoration and labeling of daily necessities produced by factories across the country, such as landscape paintings on towels, washbasins, and teapots, as well as picture cards in cigarettes, should be replaced with cartoons and simple slogans that are rich in anti-Japanese war significance, in order to boost the courage to resist the enemy and expand the effect of propaganda.

### Clearance of Goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia Held in Haiphong; Consultation on Extending Registration Deadline

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Sichuan Merchants Public Welfare Association regarding the certification of goods from Germany held by Chinese merchants. The Chamber forwarded the letter to the French Consulate General in Shanghai, requesting assistance. A reply has now been received from the French Consulate General stating that the Chamber’s letter regarding the German goods handled by Sichuan merchants has been duly noted. The Consulate General requests that the Chamber promptly send a relevant person, carrying supporting documents for the purchase of the aforementioned goods, to the Consulate General to complete the procedures. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has forwarded this information to the Sichuan Merchants Public Welfare Association to inform the relevant merchants to proceed accordingly.

Two Commissioners in Contact Yesterday

Wu Bomin and Chen Shanzhi, special commissioners of the Haiphong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, visited Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of General Chambers of Commerce, and Xu Jiqing, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, yesterday to discuss the issue of goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia detained in Haiphong. (1) Regarding the visa issue, the French Consul has agreed to handle it. (2) Regarding the extension of the registration deadline, a request has been made to the Haiphong authorities, and Consul General Xu in Hanoi and Consul Liu in Haiphong have been asked to assist in achieving the extension. However, it is difficult to predict whether the Haiphong authorities will approve it. It is hoped that all cargo owners will find a way to complete the procedures before the end of this month.

Visa Procedures to Be Handled as Soon as Possible

Since the Haiphong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the French Consul General reached an agreement on the visa procedures for goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia detained in Haiphong and awaiting shipment to the southwestern provinces of China, cargo owners have been applying for visas from the French Consulate General. They are taking the visa documents to the Haiphong authorities to request clearance. However, the Haiphong authorities have set a deadline of the 31st of this month. The cargo owners with goods detained in Haiphong are mostly dealing in Western pigments, paper, medicine, hardware and machine parts. Yesterday, Zhang Peizhen, a special representative of the Paper Industry Association, visited Wu and Chen, the two special representatives of the Haiphong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, to discuss the clearance of goods.

### British Military Attaché Spear Arrives in Shanghai; Detained by Japanese Troops for Several Months; Will Stay Briefly in Shanghai

According to the English-language "China Press," Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the British Army military attaché to China, who was detained by Japanese troops in Zhangjiakou for several months, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin today (the 21st) and may stay here for a few days.

The national goods manufacturers participating in the office include Zhonghua Hat Factory, Guoguang Thermos Bottle Factory, Dafeng Knitting Factory, Meihua Underwear Company,

### Yochow Steamer Flees to Shantou to Avoid Hurricane but is Refused by Japanese Under False Pretenses; Rejection of Third-Country Shipping Reaches New Peak; Failure to Provide Assistance in Times of Danger is Unbecoming of Civilized Nations

According to the English-language "China Press," the Japanese obstruction of third-country shipping along the Chinese coast reached a new peak last week when, according to passengers on the Yochow steamer of the Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Company of Hong Kong, the Japanese refused to allow the steamer to enter Shantou to take shelter from a hurricane. Passengers aboard were angered by the Japanese "action, unworthy of a civilized nation, in refusing to assist a ship in distress." When the Yochow approached Shantou, signals were sent from the shore to stop the ship and order it out of the harbor, claiming that there were no good places to shelter from the hurricane in the port of Shantou. The Yochow, having been driven away from Shantou, sailed thirty miles further to Nan’ao Island to anchor. Fortunately, when the Yochow first anchored, the direction of the hurricane blowing towards the ship changed, so the passengers escaped great danger. The Yochow remained there for sixty-six hours before continuing on its way, reaching Shanghai from Hong Kong in almost eight days. All kinds of food were sufficient on board, so the passengers had no complaints about this. According to shipping circles, there are now few safe havens from hurricanes along the Chinese coast, as the Chinese, in order to prevent the Japanese from invading, have removed the markers previously erected along the coast to assist navigation.

According to the "North China Daily News," officials from Japanese consulates stationed in eleven cities in China, including Hong Kong, began a two-day meeting at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday (the 30th). According to a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate General, the scope of the meeting is the broadest since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, aiming to discuss technical details for conducting consular affairs and to exchange information on the current situation in their respective locations. Two officials dispatched from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo are also participating.

### The Truth Behind the Case of Intimidation of an Assistant Manager of a Money Exchange; Money Exchange Exploits with High Interest Rates; A Small Loan Results in a Major Lawsuit; Bullying a Woman Leads to Harm to the Innocent; The Borrower Raises Funds to Clear the Debt

Zhang Lingyun, the assistant manager of Yongcheng Money Exchange, located in room 241 of the Zhonghui Building, which lends money at high interest rates, hired lawyer Sun Shi'an to represent him in a case against Bi Haomin in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Bi of using a handgun to violently intimidate and threaten him. The arguments have concluded, and a ruling is pending. This newspaper has previously reported on this case. The content of this case is complex, and the details are worth disclosing, so we will describe it in more detail below. It was found that before the August 13th incident,

Wang Xiquan, a mail carrier from the post office, borrowed 60 national currency units from Yongcheng Money Exchange, with Mao Wenlong, the former postmaster of Qianlima Road Post Office, and a Mr. Zhang, currently an employee of the package department of the Postal Administration, as co-guarantors. Wang had repaid over two periods, with a net balance of 48 units (although the loan was 60 units, after deducting pre-paid interest and various fees, only about 80% was received). The war broke out suddenly, and financial transactions ceased, so Wang did not continue to pay on time. This year or last year, the money exchange

Filed a Lawsuit in Court

(Presumably a collective lawsuit) against the second defendant, the guarantor Mao Wenlong himself. In the previous year, Mao was transferred to the Hankou Post Office, and his family resided at No. 130 Maggie Lane. The court summoned them, but the woman, unfamiliar with legal procedures, did not appoint anyone to appear in court after receiving the summons. Later, after being instructed, she refused to accept the final summons from the execution court, leading to an argument with the process server. The process server told Mao's wife that unless she immediately divorced Mao Wenlong, she could not escape responsibility. As a result, Mao's family

Became Greatly Alarmed

And advertised to sublet the rented house and hurriedly moved to the countryside. A person named Li Linshu found Zhang Yimei at the contact location and was led to Maggie Lane to sublet the house. Unexpectedly, within three days of moving in, Li's wife went into confinement, and the company led many people to seal up the movable property in the house. Despite all explanations, no one paid attention. Li had no choice but to negotiate with Zhang Yimei and tell Bi Haomin, Zhang's employer. Bi, filled with righteous indignation, accompanied Li to the Yongcheng Money Exchange to explain the situation and

Requested Immediate Unsealing

Unexpectedly, the money exchange wanted to kill the chicken to scare the monkeys (those borrowing money at high interest rates). Seeing that Bi was wearing a self-defense handgun, they exaggerated the situation and twisted Bi over to the police for prosecution. The case is now awaiting sentencing. It is perplexing that the money exchange only sealed up the movable property of the guarantor for 48 units, without ever pursuing the principal debtor Wang or the other guarantor Zhang. They solely targeted the second guarantor, who was not in Shanghai,

And Their Female Family Members

Exercised Their Legal Rights. Moreover, the current tenant was not the original tenant, and the debtor Wang and the other guarantor Zhang were clearly still working at the Shanghai Post Office. The reason for this is unclear. It is also heard that there are many companies in Shanghai lending money at high interest rates. Since the outbreak of the war, most debtors have temporarily left Shanghai. It is now known that there are countless cases where unilateral judgments have been publicly served, forcing repayment of debts. Once clarity is restored, there will be countless disputes. Wang, the original debtor in the intimidation case, knowing that the matter had

Affected Outsiders

Innocently, has raised funds to settle the matter with the company. However, it is heard that all expenses since the lawsuit must be paid off first before the loan account can be closed. The current total of fees being pursued for the lawsuit will amount to 40 units. Even the car fare for the seizure alone costs more than 6 units.

Philanthropic Lottery Hires Manager Xu Weizhou

The charity lottery for the relief of refugees, the only lottery allowed to be issued in the two concession areas, has been running for fourteen periods since its inception. The prizes are generous, and the credit is outstanding. The relief funds allocated to Chinese and Western charities have successively reached a large sum of more than 700,000 units. For the sake of convenience in promotion, Xu Weizhou has been hired as the Chinese General Manager. Mr. Xu is a well-known scholar in our country who studies sales techniques. He presides over Fengxing Company and promotes various methods, which are deeply appreciated by the members of the lottery committee. In addition to the monthly charity lottery, it is heard that a large charity lottery method has been drafted, with drawings held once or twice a year. Each ticket costs ten units, and the first prize is one million units. The first drawing is scheduled to be held before the end of the lunar year.

### Seven Robbers Hold Up Car; Over 40,000 Yuan Stolen

At 10:45 AM yesterday, a car with license plate number 18230 was traveling on Xiaoshadu Road near Nanyang in the Public Concession when suddenly seven robbers, armed with handguns and seemingly aware that the people in the car were carrying a large sum of money, appeared from their hiding places. As the car approached, they shouted for it to stop, opened the car door, pulled one of the passengers out of the car, and robbed him of 41,000 yuan in cash before fleeing. The police were informed and rushed to apprehend them, but the robbers had disappeared. A thorough investigation is currently underway.

Another report stated that the car that was held up, with Public Concession license number 18230, was a rented car hired by Hengmao Money Exchange at No. 379 Sichuan Road. Because a depositor was withdrawing money, a special car was hired to deliver it. It is unknown how the robbers learned of this and ambushed the car on the way. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation and tracing the robbers. The actual amount stolen was 41,000 yuan.

### Four Russian Jewish Men Expelled from Hong Kong for Holding Forged Passports Arrive in Shanghai; The Main Culprit of Forging Passports Arrested in Shanghai; Awaiting the Arrival of the Four Russian Men to Investigate the Case

Recently, four Russian Jewish men traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong, posing as Portuguese and Polish nationals.

The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the process and requested an adjournment because the investigation was still ongoing and the four Russian men deported by the Hong Kong authorities had not yet arrived in Shanghai. Judge Dai Rongduo questioned him briefly and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further questioning.

Wang Zhaorong, a 28-year-old native of Huzhou, is a flying thief who specializes in stealing silverware from the kitchens and living rooms of Western residences in the Western District, using his skills in climbing walls and scaling buildings. He had been punished by the British and French concessions in the past and had disappeared for a long time. Recently, he resumed his old tricks, and thefts from Western merchants' homes in the Western District of the French Concession occurred one after another. Inspector Sui Wenzhi of the French Police managed to arrest Wang and sent him to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. Details of the investigation have been reported in this newspaper.

### Social Miscellany

Jealousy Leads to Fighting

Chen Axiao, a native of Suzhou residing at No. 238 Yunnan Road, became jealous over a woman in Huile Lane, Guangxi Road, on the afternoon of the 20th of last month. He gathered two or thirty hooligans to beat his rival, Lu Shijin, causing injuries. Chen was arrested and released on bail. Now, the victim, Lu Shijin, has suddenly died from his injuries, so the police have changed the charge against Chen to causing death by injury. The First Special District Court continued the closed-door hearing yesterday, but the defendant avoided appearing in court. The court announced that the case would be adjourned for another hearing.

Robbers Injure People

Last night at 10:30 PM, more than ten robbers, each carrying firearms, suddenly arrived at the home of Shen Shaolian, the former local security officer of Liu Family Lane, Nanshou, Hongqiao Town, in the Shanghai Western District. They broke into the house to rob and severely injured Shen Shaolian, beating him over a hundred times. After the robbery, they went to the home of Wang A'hai, a farmer in Beishou, Wang Genglang, to force him to reveal the location of his hidden silver. Wang had no money, which angered the robbers. They surrounded him, beat him violently, leaving him covered in injuries and unconscious. His life is in danger.

### Case of the Manager of the Anle Palace Hotel Smoking Opium; Chen Zhanxiong Released on Bail; Bribery Still Under Investigation

Chen Zhanxiong, a Ningbo native who is the owner of the Anle Palace Hotel dance hall on Edouard Road and the manager of the Yiwentai Club on Yuyuan Road in the Shanghai Western District, was arrested by the French police on the 2nd of this month for smoking opium in the Anle Palace. He was sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. He was first sent to the detention center for one month to quit his opium addiction. In the detention center, inmates Qin Jiaqi, Tao Yongchang, Chen Jusheng, and others colluded with guards Luo Zhiyi, Jiang Nai, Tu Gang, etc., to extort 150 yuan from Chen, which they divided among themselves. The warden discovered this and reported it to the supervising department, which searched for evidence. Chen Zhanxiong was also charged with bribery, so the case was transferred to the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. The guards Jiang and Tu fled for fear of punishment. Details of these events have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Chen Zhanxiong has completed his opium detoxification in the detention center. The prison doctor reported this to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, which granted permission for him to be released on bail. However, Chen's bribery and the case of extortion by the inmates and guards have been opened for investigation by the prosecutor of the Second Special District Court. Chen Zhanxiong was allowed to be released on 3,000 yuan written bail pending further investigation. Yesterday, Chen's family asked the Dahua Bakery to provide a guarantee. After the court verified and approved it, Chen was released in the afternoon.

### Mistake

— Wan Wen

Whether big mistakes or small mistakes, nobody is without mistakes. Not only do children make mistakes, but adults make mistakes, and even great figures in society are bound to make mistakes. So, having mistakes is not a shameful thing. What is very shameful for children is refusing to admit their mistakes and refusing to correct them.

Why do we make mistakes? Some are made unintentionally, some are made intentionally. Unintentional mistakes are very easy to happen to children because you have less knowledge and less experience. For example, you might write the wrong word or say the wrong sentence, and sometimes you might not even realize it yourself. Once someone points it out, you resolve to pay attention and correct it, and you won't make the mistake again. So, unintentional mistakes can sometimes actually increase our knowledge and gradually reduce the number of mistakes we make. Some mistakes are made intentionally. For example, you know that being dishonest is wrong, but you can't control yourself and you lie, or you take someone else's belongings. If you don't resolve to correct these kinds of mistakes, then you will do this not only in small things in the future, but also in big things. If you have dishonorable behavior, then you will be despised by everyone.

The worst thing is to excuse yourself when you make a mistake and to criticize and ridicule others behind their backs when they make a mistake. Both of these attitudes are wrong. We should always correct our own small mistakes and sincerely point out the mistakes of others to their faces, advising them and encouraging them to resolve not to make the mistakes again. If we learn from each other in this way, our group will be very healthy.

Finally, I offer this saying to children: "Be generous to others, be strict with yourself." I want you to constantly examine your own behavior in your life. Correct small mistakes branch by branch, and even if you encounter difficult things in the future, you won't make mistakes. This is very important for our future success in our careers.

### Children's Telephone Bureau

— Xing

In Moscow's Central Park, the skilled members of the "Archimedes Club" have set up a children's telephone bureau. All the positions in the bureau, from the director to the tea boy, are held by the children themselves. There are a total of eighty telephone lines, connected to various parts of Central Park and the various offices in the park and in the children's village. In addition, there are twenty-five telephone extensions, distributed around the park and in the center. Each extension represents a major Russian city, representing a total of twenty-five important cities. Next to each telephone, a child is waiting. This child is the mayor representing that city. As soon as the general office has an order, it can be announced to the entire park immediately and extremely quickly.

For example, if a disturbance or riot occurs in City A, a telephone call can be made to Cities B and C for assistance. If something unexpected happens in City D, news can be exchanged with Cities C and E. This telephone system cultivates the fundamental foundation for children to serve the country in the future.

At some point, the names of these twenty-five telephones were changed to the capital cities of twenty-five countries. Each child represents a country, communicating with each other on the phone, expressing their opinions and so on. The intention is to have each child use the telephone as a radio station for international communication, so that children develop a friendly international outlook from an early age.

### What is the Earth Like?

The younger brother says: "The earth is like a ball, hollow and round on the outside."

The younger sister says: "The earth is like an orange, not round, a bit flat."

The older sister says: "The earth is like a top, spinning around and around by itself."

The older brother says: "The earth is like an airplane playing around the lights."

### Returning Home

— Bai Zheng

—— Thirty-Ninth of the Chronicle of Seeking Refuge, Ming Er ——

Three pairs of feet stepped into the county town, and in less than an hour, they had gone from the west end of the county to the east end of the city walls, clearly having walked through the entire town. They then stepped back onto the original road to return home through the west gate of the city. However, their empty baskets were now filled with verdant vegetables – spinach, shepherd's purse, green vegetables, any kind of vegetables were needed. Yet, the three baskets were limited, and no matter how they pressed and stuffed the vegetables into the baskets, many, many vegetables still fell out within the city. They wished they could adopt the strategy of "Let all the vegetables come to me," and buy them all up, carrying them back.

"How is it that this city is finished after only one walk through by us? Such narrow streets, no cars, no sedan chairs, a few small shops, no electric lights, no running water, can this even be called a county town?" On the way home, Ming Er secretly felt indignant on behalf of her prosperous and modern hometown, and seemed to be despising it, saying.

"Don't underestimate it. Although formally it may not meet the conditions of a county town, perhaps in terms of situation, commerce, economy, and military affairs, it has its importance. Have you seen: there is a county government, a bureau of education, a public education center, all very complete, just small. As the saying goes, 'A sparrow may be small, but it has all the vital organs,' this saying matches that county town quite well." The father seemed to be on the side of the county town, defending it as if to protect it. These few words cut off the chatterbox.

At this time, the county town was obscured from their view by small hills. It was evident that they had already traveled a considerable distance from the town. How did the baskets gradually become heavier? When they were buying, they had the mentality that the more the better, pressing and stuffing the items, arranging them very well, the capacity of the baskets was full to the point of being impossible to fill any further. Lifting them up didn't feel too cumbersome. But now it was terrible, after walking for a while, the baskets had gained several pounds, the burden on their arms also increased accordingly, and their feet also became a lot heavier. One hand carried them, and after walking only a few dozen steps, it gave out. The other hand was originally unwilling, but helplessly took over, feeling unbearably heavy, as if a large stone was pressing on the arm, causing it to ache in waves. Such traveling was too exhausting. After all, people are clever: after suffering, they change their approach. They tied the towels to the baskets and carried them on their shoulders, initially feeling quite comfortable, and their arms were much lighter. But with each step the foot took, it seemed that the Earth's center increased its suction force, giving the appearance that the basket on the shoulder was being pulled down to the ground by the suction, therefore the shoulder produced a resisting force, and its burden became heavier.

Although more than half the road had been traveled, the increase in the weight of the baskets had doubled or tripled, and both shoulders had run out of strength to exchange, and the arms had not recovered their original state. Their father's walking stick was then utilized: the three baskets were tied to the center of the walking stick, and carried at both ends, so that one person could walk with empty hands. The person carrying the load on their shoulders also seemed to feel lighter because of the change in method. After walking a stretch of road, they replaced one another, and after traveling another distance, they changed again. With great difficulty, they caught sight of the village where their home was. After turning a few bends, they entered the village area. They thought they were about to reach home, and quickened their pace. However, the more they wanted to get home sooner, the faster they walked, but it seemed like they had walked a very long way. Looking at the roof of their house, there was still a considerable distance to go. They bore with it and walked even faster. At this time, they didn't care much about the pain in their arms or the heaviness in their feet, and ran home with great enthusiasm, each carrying a basket. Finally, they reached home, put down the cumbersome baskets, and let out a long breath. That evening, their mother cooked delicious dishes as a reward for their efforts.

### Children's Amusement Park

— Jin Ding

Because children are the future masters of the country, the roots of the nation, therefore, our attention to the happiness of children should be promoted in many ways, and "children's recreation" should naturally not be an exception.

The authorities of the New New Company have always made considerable efforts to pay attention to the happiness of children. Recently, after the opening of the New Capital Hotel, it was further stipulated that a "Children's Amusement Park" would be held every Sunday, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, located at the Shanghai Opera Hall on the sixth floor of the New Capital.

Each time the "Children's Amusement Park" is held, the author always brings a few children and goes to participate with great joy. Because they do not sell tickets and absolutely welcome children to participate, the number of children is, of course, a very large part.

In the "Children's Amusement Park," what is performed includes children's broadcasting, speeches, singing, dancing, and valuable educational films. While the films are being shown, they are explained, so that every child can understand the meaning in the films. In addition, performances of martial arts and magic tricks can all inspire children's will to improve and scientific thinking.

### The Blue Dwarf

— Ai Li

Ah Li, disregarding her uncle's fatigue, continued to ask, "Is this forest the largest in the entire province?" Her uncle, drowsy, didn't hear clearly what Ah Li was asking, and replied casually, "Yes, yes! It's the largest." Ah Li exhaled with surprise and joy, thinking in her heart, "If there really is a dwarf country in the world, then it must be here." Immediately, she raised her voice and said to her uncle, "Uncle, I want to ask you——" Her aunt lazily raised her head and said, "Dear child, be quiet, please. It's best if you take a nap too. This forest is very large, and we still have a long way to go before we leave the forest." Ah Li, hearing these words, was very unhappy and stopped speaking.

Their carriage stopped to rest in a small village in the forest; at that moment, they discovered that a horseshoe on one of the horses had come loose. The villagers came to help, but it was no use. After examining it carefully, they realized that a new horseshoe had to be made. In this way, the group of people could not continue on their way for the time being. The nearest blacksmith shop was two miles away, and the coachman had to take the horse there and bring it back, which would take at least two or three hours. It was already past six o'clock, and they had not yet reached half of their entire journey. The coachman shook his head, saying that he was unwilling to go that night and would have to wait until the next morning to depart. Because the horseshoe had come loose, the horse's foot had been injured. If it was not given sufficient rest, it would inevitably become inflamed. If they left it behind and traveled with only one horse, then the carriage would be too heavy and might not be able to withstand it.

The uncle thought for a moment and suddenly had an idea. He smiled and said to his aunt, "I think just one horse is enough for all of us. Why don't we give it a try?" The aunt hurriedly said, "Why should we force ourselves to travel? It wouldn't matter if we rested here for the night. Fortunately, there are two bedrooms in the small inn, which are very comfortable. As for food, they can probably provide some. We just need some beer, sausages, and yellow bread, and that will be enough."

The uncle agreed, and Ah Li was especially happy, planning to leave immediately, but Ah Li was cold and indifferent and didn't show any indication. The aunt hurriedly said, "Ah Li, are you unwilling to go with us? You didn't doze off in the carriage just now, maybe you're feeling tired?"

Although Ah Li was not tired, because she had other intentions, she told a lie, saying, "Yes, I'm a little tired. If you can forgive me, then I'm willing to stay here and rest. Fortunately, I have books to read, so I won't be lonely, and I also love this area of the forest."

The uncle said, "Then it's fine if you don't go with us, but if you want to take a walk in the forest, be careful not to get lost." He then turned back and said to his aunt, "Don't worry, this area of the forest is very quiet. There are no jackals or tigers, and no robbers or bad people."

Entertainment Industry

### Characteristics of Wireless Cinema

— Xin Ying

Wireless cinema has begun to be realized. At the same time, Hollywood film companies have received solid guarantees that after wireless cinema becomes popular, the films produced by Hollywood companies can be supplied in large quantities for broadcasting wireless cinema.

Once wireless cinema becomes popular, the cost of replicating images and sound will be very cheap, and all radio stations can broadcast them without spending a lot of money to broadcast them across the country. All programs can be cataloged in advance and sent to the inspection office for inspection to avoid temporary obstacles.

Once the programs are finalized, they will be filmed by regular film companies with regular movie actors. This can remedy a headache currently felt by Hollywood, which is that movie actors' radio broadcasts and impromptu vocal exercises affect the progress of the company's work.

From the above, we have seen that wireless cinema and the film industry have a mutual relationship. Therefore, after wireless cinema becomes popular, it will not only not affect the film industry, but on the contrary, it can enable film companies to increase the production of films suitable for wireless cinema. I think you readers must be eagerly awaiting this newly invented work to appear before our eyes soon.

### Wang Yaoqing Decides to Come to Shanghai

— A Man of All Tones

—— Coming South with Wang Yurong ——

The old actor Wang Yaoqing has been separated from the people of Shanghai for a long time. Since performing at the Old Gong Stage in Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, he has never come south for more than ten years. Now, Huang Jin has sent someone to Ping to invite Yaoqing's favorite female disciple Wang Yurong to come south to perform, and has invited the old retainer to come along to see the sights of the isolated island after the disaster that he has not seen in more than ten years. However, because Mr. Wang is old and has motion sickness, he politely declined Huang Jin's invitation. However, Yurong, since entering Wang's school, has become famous in the north and has never returned to her old home. This time, "returning in glory," she also strongly invited her teacher to come south together. At that time, there were two rumors in the Shanghai opera world: one, that Mr. Wang would not necessarily come to Shanghai; and two, that the old retainer would definitely come south. The news was divided and uncertain. Now, I, a humble person, have received news from a "semi-official source" that Yurong has sent a special telegram to someone closest to Yurong (arriving at 7:30 last night), with only twelve characters: "Teacher, after Rong's earnest request, has agreed to depart from Shuntian together." As long as there are no changes along the way, this matter should not go awry. When asked to Huang Jin authorities, they did not acknowledge it, but Yaoqing's coming here will be a playful nature, and whether he will perform on the Huang Jin stage for a few days still needs to be decided after arriving in Shanghai. The Shuntian Wheel has already set sail from Shanghai a few days ago, so the date of the Wang teacher and apprentice's arrival in Shanghai will not be far away. I dare to tell the readers: "Wang Yaoqing has decided to come to Shanghai."

### The Marriage Mystery of the "Um" Girl

Ann Sheridan, who recently received the title of "Um Girl," is one of Hollywood's brightest new stars. Her transcendent beauty can make people lose their souls at first sight. Therefore, there are countless young men who are enamored with her. Even old gentlemen over forty cannot help but admit that she is a lovely person that they have never seen or heard of. American speculators have all come up with ideas to use Ann Sheridan's beautiful name as a slogan for goods or stores, such as Sheridan Socks, Sheridan Pants, Ann Sheridan Cafe, and Sheridan Ice Cream, which are everywhere. Every commodity or store, just by adding Ann Sheridan's name, will make a profit three times over. From this, we can see the general public's infatuation with Ann Sheridan!

Miss Ann is twenty-two years old this year. She was born in Texas, USA. Her ancestors' blood contains Scottish, Irish, and Indian elements. This is what has created Miss Ann's unique beauty today. She was previously married to a movie actor, but soon announced their divorce. Until now, she has not found a new sweetheart. Therefore, the men who worship her, whether they know her or not, often send her letters proposing marriage. There are at least four hundred such letters every day, but Miss Ann never replies and simply throws them into the wastepaper basket. This is not because Miss Ann is unfeeling, but it is said that because she plans to remain single! Although recently she and actor Shelley Romiro have often been seen going in and out together and their relationship seems very close, Miss Ann absolutely denies that there is a romance. What will happen in the end? We can only wait for the next episode! (De Gang)

New Movie Introduction

### Until the Day We Meet Again (Part Two)

— Qi Hua

"When Tomorrow Comes"

The acting skills of Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne had already left a deep impression in "Love Affair." This second collaboration in "Until the Day We Meet Again" still maintains their past achievements. I think the best scenes are: (1) After coming out of the church, Charles Boyer is going to see his wife, and asks Irene Dunne if she wants to see her. Irene Dunne shakes her head. After Charles Boyer leaves, she quietly boards a bus to New York. (2) Charles Boyer sends Irene Dunne off the bus and revisits Irene Dunne. (3) Barbara O'Neil visits Irene Dunne. (4) Their final separation: "I will come back," Charles Boyer says; "I will wait for you," Irene Dunne replies. In this scene, although they are consistently plain and steady, the conflict and contradiction of their psychological states are revealed in their words.

Having gotten used to the Hollywood movies with high-speed romance techniques, such a movie like "Until the Day We Meet Again" (although it is also a love story), whether it is the directing technique, the actors' acting skills, or the photography and lighting (when lighting candles in the church), is worth learning from.

### Yu Wedding Repertoire

— Yu Gong

Mr. Yu Qiaqing's eldest grandson, Ji Yun's, wedding has a grand celebration, as recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is said that the person in charge of arranging the plays is Mr. Jin Tingsun, the owner of the Huang Jin Grand Theater. In fact, Mr. Jin is the general manager of the Yu wedding, and all affairs are entrusted to Sun Lanting, Wu Jiangfeng, Zhai Qijun, Zhao Peixin, and his literary companion, Jin Yuansheng, etc., to handle. The repertoire for the day (i.e., tomorrow) has been completely assigned. The curtain will rise at 2:00 PM. Li Fuchun and Wang Xiaoqiao's Great Blessing, Liu Hanchen (formerly Qiao Xuan, later Zhang Fei), Xue Youqin (Sun Shangxiang), Gao Xueqiao (Zhao Yun), and Xu Hongpei (Liu Bei) will perform the complete Ganlu Temple, Returning to Jingzhou, and Reed Flower Marsh. Zhang Shulan and Liang Yiming's Golden Horse Hoof, Xiao Xiao Wang Guiqing, Xiao Er Wang Guiqing, and Xiao San Wang Guiqing's Small Water Curtain Cave, Wu Suqiu, Han Jinkui, and Sun Yaofang's Spring Fragrance Makes Trouble at School, Xiao Linghong, Gai Sanxing, and Zhao Zhiqiu's Picking Jade Bracelet, Hu Peixin, Li Kechang, and Wang Qijun's Catching Cao and Lodging at an Inn, Zhang Shuxian, Li Junyu, and Chu Zhihua's Xin'an Post, Zhou Xinfang, Hu Ruquan, and Yuan Shihai's Battle of Changsha, Song Dezhu, Furong Cao, and the entire Song Troupe's Jinshan Temple. The above repertoires are all complete full-length pieces, performed from beginning to end. It is estimated that the performance will last until dawn. Later, Yang Baosen of Huang Jin, Wang Shaolou of the Gong Stage, and Gao Baishui of Carlton had all joined, but due to time constraints, they could only politely decline. Such a good show, with the costume team being Han Jinkui's Jin Yutang, it is thought that not only will the New Capital Hotel be bustling tonight, but Han Jinkui will also be too busy to cope.

### Chatting about Zhao Jinrong

— Ni Qiuping

This time, inviting new performers to come and perform in phases is really special. Zhao Jinrong is the performer who will take the stage in the second phase. People in Shanghai are probably a little unfamiliar with her. Speaking of it, Jinrong had a very bad experience, losing her father at the age of nine. She entered the opera school at the age of thirteen and graduated in 1937 (one year earlier than Hou Yulan). This school later formed its own troupe, and those good performers such as Jiang Miaoxiang, Li Duokui, and Chen Shaolin were all by her side, and they had very good luck in the old capital. In addition to studying at the opera school, she has also sought advice from her teacher Wang Yaoqing. As for the Mei style (such as Luo Shen and Phoenix Returns to Its Nest), it was taught by Xu Lanyuan. Recently, someone suggested that Yu Rong should become a disciple of Mr. Guo Xiaoqing. Mr. Guo once replied, "Anything that can be done is fine, there is nothing that can't be done." In this way, there probably won't be any problems. I once chatted with Jinrong about various opera stories and art, and she answered them fluently and was very modest. I have an experience with modest people - the more they earn, the greater their ability. Zhao Jinrong is indeed a rising star.

Zhao Jinrong studies Qingyi and Huadan; half of her singing style is from Cheng and half from Mei. There are the most people studying Mei and Cheng, but as for what they learn to, that all depends on themselves. I hope Jinrong will strive for it.

News from the Art World: A brand new, all-encompassing publication, "Art World," will appear at the end of this year. The content includes movies, dramas, and various forms of entertainment, with rich illustrations and carefully compiled. The writers are all first-class writers and movie stars from the art world. In addition to being sold in major first-run theaters and major companies in this city, it will also be marketed overseas, so that overseas compatriots can have a deep impression of the art of the motherland.

International Dynamics

### Italy's Foreign Policy in Observation

— Du Xing

Hesitating Between Two Groups Without a Decision, Remaining on the Side of Victory Is Still Its Consistent Style

Mussolini has always been more stable than Hitler. Since Italy declared its neutrality, he has been in constant communication with German messengers on one hand, and frequently sending overtures to Britain and France on the other. After Poland was divided up, Russia's power had already approached the Balkan Peninsula. We can see his anxiety from Mussolini's calm mind.

Italy Feels Threatened

In fact, there are unspeakable reasons for Mussolini's declaration of neutrality. He knows that Hitler is hiding behind his Western Front fortress, which does not hinder his position for the time being. However, Mussolini's own position is at the place in the world with the most intense firepower. If he leans towards Hitler, military action will immediately cause northern Italy to be ravaged by the French army, and the joint British-French Mediterranean fleet will not be difficult to destroy coastal cities in Italy. Turkey would also be able to attack Italy from Greece from behind.

Friends in Need Break Up

In addition to the above, there are many reasons that make Mussolini feel deeply troubled. Mussolini has experts and military personnel hired from Hitler. However, this time Hitler disregarded his long-suffering friend and colluded with Stalin, which was quite an insult to Fascism! In this way, Mussolini cannot call on General Franco to attack France from behind in Spain. At the same time, Italy is a poor country. Although Mussolini can send his people to the front lines, who in Italy is willing to fight honestly? Therefore, Mussolini's declaration of neutrality is actually his logical and consistent action, and it is inevitable. He is also afraid that the Soviet Union and Germany will take advantage of their victorious power to expand into the Balkans, which is also intolerable to Mussolini, which is why he is uneasy and unwilling to think and act like Hitler.

However, under the current situation, can Mussolini's neutrality last long? Will the expansion of Soviet power into the Balkan Peninsula shake Italy's neutral position? Italy used to be a springboard for the German Emperor in 1915. Who can guarantee that Mussolini will not sabotage Hitler this time? Regarding this, Mussolini has firmly denied that he has any dissent with Hitler. However, we must not ignore the pressure that Britain and France have put on Mussolini. Since the outbreak of the war, the frequent guests in the office of Mussolini's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Ciano, have been the British and French ambassadors to Italy. Recently, Italy's new ambassador to the UK took office and held secret talks with British Foreign Secretary Halifax. It is said that he has an important mission from Mussolini. From this, we can see the direction Mussolini is taking. At present, he is conservative in maintaining neutrality, but he is just copying the old tricks of the last war, and the result is that he will inevitably jump into the fire.

Let's look at Mussolini. Before declaring neutrality, he also pretended, as if he was going to work with his partner Hitler. After Hitler fired the first shot at Poland, he immediately implemented very detailed mobilization work, making his people restless; the whole country implemented a blackout, coffee was only allowed to be sold to soldiers, only state organs had the right to use gasoline, and all private car travel was prohibited after September 3. Later, the decision of neutrality was made, and the terrifying atmosphere was relaxed. Mussolini only has one sentence: "If Italy is attacked, it will resist immediately." In fact, only he attacks others, and others will never attack him. He also divided his troops under the command of General Graziani and Crown Prince Umberto. The former has always had no good feelings for Hitler, while the latter is supported by the Italian people. From this, we can see what Mussolini's intentions are.

Still a Fence-Sitting Policy

Now, Italy is bright at night again, and foreign mail is also arriving on time. Italian troops have been withdrawn from the border between Libya and Egypt, and the Italian garrison at the border between Albania and Greece has also been reduced. The French border has been reopened. However, Mussolini has not yet opened the mountain roads leading to Germany; on the one hand, under the close supervision of Britain and France, goods have also stopped being transported from Italy to Germany.

Mussolini's declaration of neutrality is like building a wall in Romania; protecting the countries of the Balkan Peninsula; on the other hand, he is sitting on the wall, looking at the artillery fire on the German-French border and the evolution of the world situation with a telescope, watching who has the upper hand, and when he sees it clearly, he will immediately take action.

### A Corner of the Battlefield: A Glimpse of Occupied Hangzhou

— Song Sheng

Deathly Still, Devoid of Life

The State of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway After the Bombing

Hangzhou—my hometown! Since being trampled by the iron hooves [of the invaders], everything has changed. The beautiful West Lake seems to have suffered great humiliation, and has been neglected and forgotten by people. The world-famous Qiantang River tidal bore is no longer appreciated or viewed. Foreign warriors have replaced poets and literati, and the clattering of machine guns has replaced the evening bells of temples. The city is deathly still, devoid of life. Although many people have recently moved back to their old homes, reaching a quarter of the pre-war population, everyone is gloomy and appears to be in a state between laughter and tears. In the most prosperous areas of the city, strangely dressed women in kimonos often stroll back and forth. The New Market is not as lively as before. At night, the entire city of Hangzhou has only sparse, ghastly green electric lights flickering like will-o'-the-wisps, symbolizing the terrible ghost world it has become.

I have not returned to my hometown for several years. I don't want to go, and I'm afraid to go, but because it is my hometown, and many relatives and friends are trapped inside, I always wanted an opportunity to visit and decide [what to do]. Recently, I made a firm decision to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train before Double Ten Day [October 10th].

The Infighting of Traitors

The inspection along the way was very strict. According to a fellow traveler, "It is because of a shooting incident in the city a few days ago. Now, nobody knows how many guerrillas have infiltrated Hangzhou—two or three thousand at most, six or seven hundred at least. No one knows the exact number, so the Japanese are extremely afraid!" Later, I learned that the person killed was the secret service chief of the Japanese military police, named Yu Xiangzhen. The murderer was his subordinate, named Ren Zhifa, also a secret agent. They had a disagreement over extorting money. During a banquet, Ren took Yu by surprise and fired several shots. Yu fell to the ground wounded. As he was being sent to the hospital, he shouted, "Ren is the one who killed me! Avenge me quickly!" The Japanese army immediately arrested Ren and prepared to behead him on the day I arrived in Hangzhou. The next day, they arrested more than ten people in succession. One of them was deemed involved in the case because he looked panicked during the arrest and was executed. But most people believe that he was wrongly killed.

The Japanese Army's Empty City Stratagem

The Japanese army stationed in Hangzhou also knew that many guerrillas were lurking in the city, so they dared not leave their fortifications at night. Even during the day, they would not walk in secluded streets and alleys unless they were in groups of more than ten. It is said that more than one incident of a small number of Japanese soldiers being killed in secluded alleys has already occurred. Not only that, because the war at the front was tight, some Japanese soldiers were transferred to the front line, and some did not want to go to the front line again, so many hanged themselves in despair, and many of them were officers. This shows the war-weariness of the Japanese soldiers.

Because the rear was empty and there were no soldiers to transfer, the Japanese army came up with a clever "empty city" stratagem. Sometimes no Japanese soldiers could be seen, and sometimes thousands would gather. The fact of the matter was that they did not have enough troops to allocate and had to use the transportation lines to unite the Japanese troops from various places. They would come here today and go there tomorrow, making people think that there were strong garrisons everywhere. In fact, it was just these same few Japanese soldiers moving back and forth. In addition, clear machine gun fire could often be heard during the day or at night, but it was nothing more than a show of force to prevent the guerrillas from attacking from time to time.

Imitation Japanese Women

In the areas near the city station and the New Market, one could often see Japanese women sitting in rickshaws, looking around with pride. At first, I didn't understand why there were so many Japanese women in Hangzhou. Later, I learned that these were not real Japanese women, but Chinese women pretending to be Japanese. Some of them were offered as "comfort items" to the "Imperial Army" by traitors, and some were forced to marry traitors as concubines due to environmental coercion and the difficulties of life. The bad people who used to commit all kinds of evils in Hangzhou are now all high-ranking officials, and all have three wives and four concubines. And in order to learn the latest fashion, and to show off to their peers, they all dress up in Japanese attire.

The State of the Railway After the Bombing

I only stayed for four days and wanted to leave Hangzhou, but my relatives and friends insisted on me staying for another day. Fortunately, I stayed another day, otherwise I would have run into the guerrilla bombing of the railway, and I might not have been able to return to Shanghai. That day, October 7th, news came in the afternoon that the railway near Chang'an had been bombed and many people were killed or injured. At that time, I was very worried that the train would not be able to pass, and I would be trapped in Hangzhou. Fortunately, I went to catch the train early the next morning, and the train was still running. When we arrived at Xucun, the train suddenly stopped. At that time, I didn't know why. After about an hour, the train started moving again. When we arrived at a deserted place, we saw that four sections of the train that had been bombed yesterday were lying on their backs by the side of the road. On one side was the train head, which had been badly damaged. Many coolies were standing on the road, rushing to repair the railway. Only then did I realize that the reason why the train had stopped just now was because the tracks had not been repaired. It had been a full twenty-four hours since the bombing yesterday morning, and the railway had not yet been repaired, which shows how violent the bombing was. The Japanese suffered a great loss this time. Although the Japanese side kept the number of dead and wounded a secret, each car and section was guarded by an average of six or seven Japanese soldiers, so at least twenty or more Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. The number of passengers killed or injured was many times that.

### From Tibetan Yellow Buddhism to the Enthronement of the New Dalai Lama

— Xiao Shan

Dalai and Panchen

Tibetan religion is divided into two sects: Red Sect and Yellow Sect, which are originally a branch of Buddhism. Since the rise of the Yellow Sect, the Red Sect has declined. The ancestor of the Yellow Sect was Tsongkhapa. When he passed away, he left a will to his two great disciples, who would be reincarnated generation after generation to inherit his mantle, one being the Dalai Lama and the other being the Panchen Lama. According to Tibetan beliefs, the Dalai Lama is the incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, and the Panchen Lama is the incarnation of Amitābha. When they are reborn, they become each other's teachers. But in terms of power, the Dalai Lama is the political and religious leader of Tibet, while the Panchen Lama is only the religious leader, and ultimately not as powerful as the Dalai Lama.

The Successive Dalai Lamas

The first Dalai Lama was born in the 24th year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty [1391], and the most recently reincarnated Dalai Lama is the fourteenth. Among them, the fifth Dalai Lama had the highest morality and learning, and the thirteenth Dalai Lama had the greatest political and religious power. The fifth Dalai Lama was deeply versed in karma and once predicted, "If the fourteenth Dalai Lama is reincarnated in Qinghai, then his morality and learning will be higher than that of the fifth." Now the fourteenth Dalai Lama has indeed been found in Qinghai, so the Tibetan people have high expectations for him. The thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away on December 17th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], and his reincarnated body was only found last year in Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai. It took a full five years, and the lamas in charge went to great lengths and endured many hardships to find our new master.

The Method of Viewing the Sea for Guidance

Originally, according to Tibetan tradition, the Dalai Lama would be reborn as an infant forty-five days after his passing. Before the ninth Dalai Lama, each Dalai Lama would specify the place of his rebirth when he passed away, but after that, there was only the so-called method of "viewing the sea for guidance" to identify the place of the new Dalai Lama's rebirth. What is called "viewing the sea for guidance"? Originally, this ceremony was held at Tengri Lake near Lhasa. During the ceremony, a phenomenon similar to a "mirage" would occur on the surface of the sea. This was the spiritual indication, which could be recorded in detail as the basis for the location of the next Dalai Lama's reincarnation. After the thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away, the Regent of Tibet, Reting Rinpoche (a great lama who can be reincarnated is called a Rinpoche), followed the custom and held the "viewing the sea" ceremony. It is said that because the scenery displayed each time was not clear, it was performed hundreds of times before the environment of the new Dalai Lama's birthplace was discovered in May of the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936] to be "a large temple covered with glazed tiles, with a Mongolian yurt next to it." But although there are large temples with glazed tiles in Tibet, there are no Mongolian yurts. Therefore, it was speculated that the fifth Dalai Lama's prophecy might come true, and lamas were dispatched to search the border areas of Qinghai and Mongolia. (According to another account, during the last "viewing the sea for guidance," a place appeared in the sea with complex ethnic groups and different costumes, as well as three Tibetan characters, meaning Kumbum Monastery.)

The New Dalai Lama Is Found

When these lamas arrived in Gannan the year before last, the Panchen Lama happened to be in the area and gave some instructions regarding the search for the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. The lamas followed his instructions and rushed to Qinghai. Sure enough, they found the fourteenth Dalai Lama, currently five years old, at the home of a local in Hongtu Cliff near Kumbum Monastery. It is said that although the new Dalai Lama is a young child, he is outstanding and dignified, and his eyes are bright and full of energy. On July 13th of this year, Ma Yuanhai, the Special Envoy of the National Government, and the lamas who were Special Envoys of the Tibetan side, escorted him from Kumbum Monastery and set off to return to Tibet. He will soon be enthroned in Lhasa. The National Government has specially appointed Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to go to Tibet to preside over the ceremony with Reting. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 18th of this month, Wu had already taken a plane to Hanoi on that day and will travel to Tibet via India.

### Today's Berlin

— Song Zhou

Everything Requires Coupons

After the outbreak of the European War, Berlin, the capital of Germany, adopted a coupon system to control food and daily necessities. By October, it was in full swing. Bread was bought with red coupons, butter with yellow coupons, and meat with green coupons. There were also fruit jam coupons and soap coupons, in a riot of colors. Anyone who did not bring these coupons could not buy what they needed. Food was marked with the words "fifty grams" or "one hundred grams," and cut according to the coupon. The coupons were valid for one week. Everyone looked a little anxious when they saw that they were about to run out.

Since October, many people have not been able to taste eggs, no matter how much money they have. The rich and the poor are treated the same, which can be said to be German-style communism.

One Pair of Shoes a Month Everything requires coupons. Buying towels, clothes, and leather shoes is the same. What is even more ridiculous is that you can only buy one shoe a month, and it takes two months to buy a pair.

Night Light Badges on the Chest Because of the blackout implemented to prevent air raids, the streets are completely dark, but in order to avoid collisions with each other, pedestrians mostly have badges coated with luminescent paint, hung on their chests, like fireflies. The glowing flowers, as accessories for passersby, also have a unique flavor.

Newspapers Not Sold at Night

Newspapers are sold out during the day and not sold at night. The general public is very concerned about politics and diplomacy. The maids at work often read the newspaper as they walk. They no longer love to read novels as they used to, but want to know the news about war and diplomacy. They want to know, is it still war, or is it peace, is it still Chamberlain, or who else?" They are very interested in Hitler's speech and want to know Chamberlain's response. But the German newspapers do not mention a word about the British response. They only report how the various neutral countries approve and welcome Hitler's speech.

The European War Unfolds, Two Powers Compete

### Counterfeit Goods—Buyers Must Pay More Attention—

The market is currently flooded with counterfeit goods. If our compatriots have some ability to distinguish them, they can tell them apart and avoid buying them. Now, according to the materials we have collected, we will tell you their characteristics:

1. Almost every trademark has a certain symbolic picture, often a very bright red rising sun, or uses a picture to show its power. For example, the Big Star brand depicts a woman in a suit, stepping on the northeast corner of the earth (i.e., the position of our four northeastern provinces), raising her hands to pursue the painted five-pointed star.

2. There are anti-propaganda pictures. For example, the Dinghua brand's Dinghua picture is a good example of anti-propaganda. It shows two soldiers holding a horizontally placed map of China. On the tripod next to the soldiers, there is Yue Fei's cry of "Return My Rivers and Mountains" arranged like a cigarette, indicating that returning our rivers and mountains is as illusory as white smoke, dissipating and vanishing, just a dream. Some matches are also printed with the slogan "North and South Unity."

3. Trademarks often contain anesthetic meanings, such as most of the trademarks that depict ancient and modern beauties, the God of Longevity, the lives of ancient nobles, the emperor's ascension to the throne, etc., the purpose of which is to anesthetize, fossilize, and corrupt our thoughts.

4. The trademark text is ungrammatical. For example, "Double Golden Horse" is written as "Golden Double Horse," and "41 Code" is written as English "Code 41." This is clearly not our country's usual practice and has the smell of a certain country's grammar.

5. The trademark has no registration number from the Ministry of Industry, only "NO," with no number behind it, such as the Oriental Great Port brand.

6. Several places can be easily distinguished from the trademark paper: 1. The paper quality is worse than foreign goods; 2. The ink can penetrate the back of the paper; 3. The color is less bright; 4. If there is a gold-plated edge, the gold will be wiped off with a light touch.

The above is only from the perspective of trademarks. As for the factory number, it can also be seen.

7. Counterfeit goods often use strange names such as "Daily New Addition" and "Daily New Chang" for the factory number name. The number of words in the factory name is often odd, such as Heng Yuansheng, Da Xinzhen, etc. The name "Cotton Cloth Number" is often used under the factory name, which is rarely seen in our country.

8. Most of the factory addresses are in Shanghai, and most are in Zhabei, Liuying Road, etc.

However, unscrupulous merchants are extremely cunning. Once their fake sign is exposed, they immediately change it. Recently, it has been discovered that a bolt of cloth or a skein of foreign yarn often has six or seven kinds of signs. Some unscrupulous merchants do not need a trademark at all. This proves that trademark identification alone is not enough. The more reliable way is to inspect the quality of the goods. The quality of the goods is low, not durable, and easily fades. For example, the recently counterfeited Danshilin cloth has this situation.

### Anecdotes of Celebrities: General Feng Yuxiang

— Han Ruo

A few years ago, when the Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission was recuperating in Mount Tai, the Lytton Commission sent by the League of Nations happened to come to China. When the investigation team passed through Tai'an, they also went to Mount Tai for a few days. One of the members lost his walking stick, so he questioned the magistrate of Tai'an and asked the magistrate to be responsible for finding it. The magistrate had no choice but to detain the sedan bearers to search. When General Feng heard this, he was furious and immediately wrote a letter to the magistrate, Zhou Baihuang, saying that he did not understand the situation and should not have agreed to find a cane for the investigation team. The reasons were: (1) The cane is a personal item, and even if it is lost, it is due to carelessness, and (2) the investigation team cannot prove that the cane was lost in Mount Tai. The investigation team had long heard of his old gentleman's great name and wanted to meet him, so they asked the reception staff to notify him. However, he refused to meet them, saying that he was ill and could not see guests. Someone said, "Mr. Feng, you are in good health. Why don't you meet this noble investigation team?" He said, "China has such a large territory and so many people. There is foreign aggression but no resistance. When we lose our territory, we go to others to beg for mercy. I am a strong soldier, but I cannot take up arms to defend my country. What face do I have to meet people? At the same time, even if the Lytton Commission achieves something, it cannot uphold justice and return our territory, so I am really ashamed to see them."

### Scientific Life: A Discourse on Nutrition

— Qin

After a person is born and lands on the ground crying, he needs food to maintain life. He needs to consume 2700 to 2800 calories of heat every day. So, what should he eat to generate so much heat? The muscles, liver, and kidneys in the human body can perform metabolism to generate heat. To promote metabolism, the original driving force is the three nutrients in living things: protein, fat, and carbohydrates. The heat generated by each nutrient maintains people's lives. Our daily standard food consumption is estimated to be 52.5 grams of protein (one gram per kilogram of body weight), 50.0 grams of fat, 500.0 grams of carbohydrates, 17.0 grams of salts, 0.1 grams of vitamins, and 200.0 grams of water. Assuming that a person lives for sixty years, the food consumed is estimated to be 200 pigs, 400 chickens, 5,000 fish, 56,000 kilograms of vegetables, 10,400 kilograms of rice, 3,000 kilograms of sugar, 500 kilograms of salt, 1,500 liters of wine, 7,000 kilograms of fruit, 400,000 cigarettes, and 10,000 liters of water. A person needs this amount to maintain his vitality throughout his life. After seeing these statistics, we should be vigilant, not waste it lightly, and not just be a "manure-making machine". We must do some work that benefits the public and live a meaningful life.

### New Invention in the Medical Field—Cancer Testing Method

— Wei

Simple and Effective

Cancer is one of the most difficult diseases to treat. In the past, testing patients for cancer was extremely troublesome, but recently, Dr. Ge Laisi Gen, a professor of cancer and cancer expert at Dingboer Medical School in Philadelphia, USA, discovered a brand-new testing method that is simple and effective. It is said to be 90% accurate. The method involves extracting the pancreas and liver from animal fetuses, extracting a special substance, subjecting it to special treatment, and making it into a liquid. A subcutaneous injection is given to the test subject. If the patient has cancer, the injection site will turn red and grow flesh thorns. If there is no cancer, there will be no such signs at all.

According to Dr. Grice Gen's explanation, although cancer cells are similar to ordinary cells, their developmental power is particularly strong, just like the cells of a fetus, but after development, they do not become useful tissues. If a person has cancer, the entire body is particularly sensitive to the same kind of cells. Therefore, in vitro, injecting fetal cells will cause a reaction and have the above-mentioned symptoms.

### Recycling Waste Materials

— Jing Hua

Now that prices are high, people's living expenses have increased, and everything must be implemented frugally. Being able to think of recycling waste materials is very much in line with the purpose of thrift. Now there are several wastes that can be turned into useful things after manufacturing:

Making Alkali from Wood Charcoal Ash

Take out the wood charcoal ash burned in the stove and soak it in water. After a day, use the clear liquid on top to wash clothes to remove oil stains. If the clear liquid is boiled dry, the resulting crystals are alkali. Dissolving it in water will become alkaline water. The ash of broad bean shells can also be used to produce alkaline substances in the same way.

Making Paper from Rags and Bagasse

First, wash the rags and bagasse with water, then cook them with caustic soda, and then put them into a mortar and pound them into a pulp. Spread it thinly on a bamboo curtain and dry it over a fire to make rough paper.

Growing Mushrooms from Rice Straw

First, cut the rice straw stalks into pieces, mix them with a bowl of glutinous rice paste and a pile of horse manure, place them on a plate, and punch small holes around it. Water it during the day, and after four weeks, straw mushrooms will grow.

There are many things that can be recycled from waste materials. The above are just three examples. I hope that people from all walks of life will publish more of their experiences.

### Strange News: Raising Snakes to Catch Mice

In Chilean homes, the work of catching mice is done by snakes. This kind of snake is a small python and is not poisonous. During the day, these snakes are quiet and sleepy, but at dusk, they gradually become active, swimming around and looking for mice. Holes are made in the beams of the houses for them to enter and exit. When someone goes to rent a house, the landlord sometimes boasts of their liveliness and ability to catch mice as one of the advantages of the house.

A stranger traveling to Chile came down from his room one night and saw a large snake coiled on the mat at the bottom of the stairs. He was so frightened that he turned around and called for help. Everyone in the house ran out, thinking something had happened. After explaining the situation, they laughed and said, "This is just 'Pete Ba', our mouser." One of them grabbed its tail and threw it aside.

The women there often carry small snakes in their skirts and play with them, just like we carry kittens and play with them. Cantonese people use snakes and cats as dishes, calling them "Dragon and Tiger Meet". Now Chile uses snakes instead of cats to catch mice. In this way, not only are the tastes of snakes and cats both excellent, but they can also perform the same work. This is really amazing!

### After Reading "Talking About the Hongmen on National Day"

— A Member of the Hongmen

The Hongmen is absolutely secret, and few people know its details. Now it is openly recorded as history and geography. Although it is only a glimpse, its fighting spirit and stance are revealed without reservation. The author's self-proclaimed Sangyu, whether it is "losing in the east corner, gaining in the mulberry elm", or considering the name and meaning, it contains encouragement and approval. All Hongmen people must be moved by this and become more excited. However, when it comes to the relationship between the Hongmen and the Kuomintang, there are slight discrepancies with the facts. Simply put: the predecessor of the Kuomintang was the Tongmenghui, the predecessor of the Tongmenghui was the Xingzhonghui, and the Xingzhonghui was the entire organization of the Hongmen. The late Premier Sun was the leader of the Zhigongtang and the President of the Xingzhonghui. For example, the "oath", "internal and external slogans", "Grand Governor"... of the Kuomintang all used the old names from more than 300 years ago in the Hongmen.

Furthermore, in the more than 200 years of wars with the Qing Dynasty, except for the two Hui-Zhun campaigns, the Hongmen took the initiative in almost all of them. The most notable ones were: the Red Flower Pavilion, the Greater and Lesser Jinchuan, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and the Wuhan Uprising. All of these battles were led by the Hongmen Governors. Because the Governors complied with the Hongmen's creed of not fighting for power after success. The Hongmen was originally a secret organization for "overthrowing the Qing and restoring the Ming" and "reviving the Han and destroying the Manchu", a national revolution. After the founding of the Republic of China, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was destroyed and the target was lost, so it should be disbanded. This has been a big question for Chinese and foreign people for more than 20 years. It must be known that the reason why the Xinhai Revolution succeeded so quickly was because the Hongmen martyrs saw that the Manchu Qing was mediocre, frequently invited foreign aggression, lost power and humiliated the country, and was on the verge of extinction. Therefore, the various mountains at home and abroad unanimously mobilized to overthrow the Manchu Qing, which only achieved the preliminary work. In the spring of Renzi [1912], the Hongmen General Assembly decided to expand the "Han ethnic group" into a revolutionary society for the five ethnic groups (i.e., the national ethnic group), and established the United General Assembly in Shanghai. Still based on the old organization and discipline, it carried out a new national revival movement. In the past "May 30th" and "January 28th" and other campaigns, the blood and soul of the Hongmen automatically made a large contribution, and the blood and soul scattered on the front lines are not known how many? The so-called National Day is the "National Memorial Day" of the Hongmen. After reading "Talking About the Hongmen on National Day", I wrote this to express my grief and indignation.
