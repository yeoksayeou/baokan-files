### Chamberlain's Statement in the House of Commons: No Change in British Far East Policy; Japan Only Hopes for Understanding of Its Difficulties and Claims; All Principles of the Nine-Power Treaty Remain Unaffected; It Remains Difficult to Predict When Formal Negotiations Will Begin

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement on the Far East situation, saying, "Various reports in the Japanese and our countries' newspapers recently claimed that the Japanese government would demand that our country fundamentally change its Far East policy as a condition for starting negotiations. I hereby clearly state that our country's foreign policy has its own considerations and will not accept demands from other countries, nor will it be convenient to accept demands from other countries and change it. (Members cheered loudly.) Moreover, I declare that we have not received such a request from the Japanese government. According to Sir Robert Craigie, our ambassador to Japan, Japan's official position is more accurately outlined as follows: that country hopes that the United Kingdom will, in its observations of the Sino-Japanese war, give due understanding to Japan's difficulties and claims. If we were to hastily assume that the Japanese government has a certain intention, such an assumption, not necessarily accurate, would only affect negotiations and hinder their success. The government also agrees with Ambassador Craigie's view. As for when formal negotiations can begin, it is still difficult to predict. According to announcements from Tokyo, Ambassador Craigie had a friendly discussion with Foreign Minister Arita at the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 15th of this month regarding the general background of the Tianjin situation and decided to postpone the talks to allow both parties to carefully consider the various issues involved. As for the Tianjin situation, it has generally improved, with sufficient food being transported into the concessions, and the milk supply is also sufficient. In addition, anti-British demonstrations have occurred in certain places in North China, and British church property in Shanxi Province has suffered minor damage. Furthermore, in Shantou, the Japanese authorities have issued a formal notice stating that ships of all countries, provided they do not interfere with military operations, may be allowed to enter Shantou Port under certain conditions, but limited to one ship per week. Regarding this matter, the British and Japanese authorities are currently conducting negotiations. In Fuzhou, a small number of British expatriates have already withdrawn." At this point, the Prime Minister addressed the arrest of Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the military attaché of the British Embassy in China, saying, "The Japanese government has notified Ambassador Craigie that Lieutenant Colonel Spear has almost certainly been interrogated, and the Japanese government will continue to investigate. Ambassador Craigie, dissatisfied with this procedure, made the strongest representations to the Japanese government and requested that a British officer who speaks Japanese be allowed to go to Zhangjiakou." Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, immediately asked, "Lieutenant Colonel Spear should enjoy diplomatic privileges. Does the Prime Minister's statement about sending a Japanese-speaking officer to Zhangjiakou to contact Lieutenant Colonel Spear mean that the government no longer demands that Japan release him immediately?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "Absolutely not. I said that the British Embassy in Japan has made the strongest representations to the Japanese government, demanding the release of Lieutenant Colonel Spear." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)

Labour MP Henderson asked if the Prime Minister meant that the Tokyo negotiations would be limited to the Tianjin incident and that the British government would not endorse any amendment to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty that deviated from the United States and other governments. The Prime Minister replied that that was indeed what he meant and that he had already stated that the government had not received any such request from the Japanese government. Labour MP Noel-Baker suggested that the British government should inform the Japanese government that Japan's invasion of China was an act of aggression condemned by the League of Nations and a crime against humanity, and that if it could be stopped, all outstanding issues between Britain and Japan could be resolved. The Prime Minister declared in response to a supplementary question that he did not think this suggestion was very helpful.

Labour MP Sorensen then asked whether atrocities had occurred in other parts of the fallen areas of China. The Prime Minister replied that he believed such atrocities mostly occurred in cities occupied by the Japanese army, and he had not heard of such incidents in other areas. Labour MP Thurtle also asked about the demonstrations outside the British Embassy in Tokyo. The Prime Minister replied that, to his knowledge, a large number of Japanese people had paraded and demonstrated in front of the British Embassy, causing police intervention, and he believed that everything was now calm there. Labour MP Fry asked whether there had been any further atrocities against British expatriates in the Tianjin area since the Prime Minister declared that the cessation of these atrocities was one of the conditions for negotiations with Japan. The Prime Minister replied that he had seen a report stating that the Japanese side had continued to impose some restrictions on the entry and exit of British expatriates into the concession, and he did not think these restrictions were commensurate with the atrocities previously complained of by the British government. Former Foreign Secretary Eden asked whether the Japanese government had not requested that the scope of the issues be expanded beyond the Tianjin incident, which he had learned. The Prime Minister replied that he had not said this. Sir Robert Craigie's conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had largely agreed on the outlines that the Japanese government believed should be followed in considering the Tianjin incident, but the Japanese government had not suggested that the discussion or resolution of general issues should be a condition for negotiations. Liberal Party leader Sinclair then asked if the British government had abandoned the demand for the immediate release of Mr. Spear, now that it had sent a Japanese-speaking officer to contact him, as Mr. Spear was entitled to diplomatic immunity. The Prime Minister replied in the negative, stating that it had certainly not been abandoned and that Sir Robert Craigie had made very strong representations to the Japanese government, demanding the release of Mr. Spear, as he had already said.

### No Change in Tianjin Situation; Anti-British Tide Grows in Various Places

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources from Tianjin received here today, no unexpected incidents have occurred in Tianjin. The Japanese authorities are quite confident in controlling the situation, but there have been several anti-British incidents in other parts of North China. The Chinese authorities in Kaifeng have demanded that British expatriates withdraw within a specified period. At the same time, a British soldier in Shanhaiguan was shot and attacked by a Chinese person. The anti-British sentiment among the Chinese masses is growing daily, and anti-British riots have intensified since the Tianjin case. According to Japanese sources in Harbin, Japanese expatriates there held an anti-British mass rally today, during which some people delivered passionate speeches, shouting the slogan "Down with Britain!" According to Japanese sources in Hankou, the Wuhan Press Association has sent a telegram to Prime Minister Hiranuma, Navy Minister Yonai, Army Minister Itagaki, and other military leaders, declaring that the association aims to eliminate British influence in China and is willing to support the anti-British policies implemented by the Japanese authorities. According to sources in Jinan, the "Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government" and the "Mayor of Jinan" both sent telegrams to the Japanese government and the Japanese Army diplomatic authorities in Tianjin today, asking them to do their best to carry out national policy and punish Britain for obstructing the establishment of the new order in East Asia. Workers at a coal mine in Xinxiang, Henan Province, also held a meeting and passed a resolution urging the Japanese government to exclude British interests in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Spear Has Not Yet Been Formally Tried

(Beiping) According to a spokesman for the Japanese army here, Mr. Spear, the military attaché of the British Embassy, has not yet been formally interrogated by a military court. Although the Japanese side has questioned Mr. Spear once, the purpose was purely to investigate whether Mr. Spear's actions were detrimental to the Japanese side, and whether Mr. Spear was acting in the capacity of a British military attaché when he was arrested on May 26. As for whether the military court will conduct a public trial of Mr. Spear or only conduct a secret interrogation, the spokesman believed it was inconvenient to disclose.

Editorial

### The North China Banknote Problem

Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the issuance has been centralized, the reserves have been centralized, banknotes no longer have bank distinctions or regional divisions, the foundation is stable, the credit is outstanding, the area is unified, and circulation is convenient. In mid-March of last year, due to the promotion of "Joint Banknotes" in the north, there was an attempt to collect and eliminate banknotes from various banks in North China in one fell swoop; the news came south, and progress was slightly hindered, but the banking authorities repeatedly stated that they would not destroy the credit of the entire legal tender due to local influences, and advised the people to continue to use it as usual, so the people were at ease. Recently, however, rumors have arisen in the market, and merchants and civilians, confused by the rumors, inevitably choose between banknotes of various colors, thus discussing banks and locations, with the intention of suppression and promotion. The impact of this has been described as "miscellaneous banknotes"; however, due to the rumors being unfavorable to miscellaneous banknotes, the number of miscellaneous banknotes has only increased, but they are still used as before. However, yesterday, bad news suddenly arrived, saying that various banks are refusing to accept banknotes with North China place names; the matter came suddenly, and holders either tried to use them without success, and spread the word, causing panic in the market, which is truly a noteworthy phenomenon.

The reasons for the North China banknote problem are said to be very diverse, but briefly: (1) It is said to be related to remittances. Since the same legal tender, the legal tender issued in North China is often lower in value than in Shanghai due to special circumstances; at the lowest point, about 130 North China legal tender dollars could be exchanged for 100 Shanghai legal tender dollars, in other words, North China place-name legal tender, converted into Shanghai legal tender, is only worth seventy-odd cents. In addition, recently, due to the impact of the Tianjin concession blockade, people are panic-stricken, and foreign exchange is incredibly expensive; for example, the lowest British exchange rate in Tianjin was 4.75 pence; if Tianjin releases foreign exchange and receives legal tender, and then settles foreign exchange in Shanghai, such a transfer would be very profitable, but this can only be done by those with special influence. Therefore, there is a saying that a certain party brought 40 million yuan of North China banknotes to Shanghai to buy foreign exchange; the absorption of spot foreign exchange and the throwing of forward exchange certainly exists, but the Sino-Japanese Tianjin banknotes seen in the market did not start recently, and it is said that foreign merchant banks are extremely strict in checking and accepting legal tender for foreign exchange transactions, and even non-uniform banknotes must be discounted separately, so even if a large number of North China banknotes are shipped to Shanghai, as long as Chinese merchant banks pay attention, what is there to fear about the possibility of collapse? (2) It is said to be related to silver reserves. From the beginning of the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession, they threatened to obtain more than 50 million yuan of Tianjin silver reserves and regarded it as one of the conditions for Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The Anglo-Japanese negotiations are still in their infancy; the British have vowed to maintain Chinese legal tender and will never take actions that would destroy the credit of Chinese legal tender; if the silver reserves are handed over to the Japanese to resolve the Tianjin case, we can believe that the British will definitely not do this. Moreover, legal tender reserves are centralized, and Tianjin silver reserves are not the reserves for North China banknotes; Tianjin silver has certainly not been allowed to be seized, and even if it were, what would it have to do with North China banknotes? Therefore, this saying is also unbelievable. (3) It is said to be related to sabotage. It is meant that the government has not made any indication, and only some banks are refusing to use it; this is a violation of legal tender orders, suppressing the common people who hold banknotes, and merely seeking to profit from the suppression and promotion of the banknotes. As for this saying, we are also concerned about the lack of real evidence, and we secretly suspect that the strength of some banks is insufficient to remedy the evil, or they have rashly done this, and the loss of conscience is extreme!

There are three kinds of rumors about the reasons for the refusal to use North China banknotes, and there is no consensus, or perhaps none of them are true; in short, it is still difficult to understand. The scope of the refusal may be all areas outside North China, or limited to Shanghai, or only some banks and exchange shops in Shanghai, which remains to be proven by facts. The nature of the refusal may be a temporary blockage, or a whole plan, or a conspiracy to destroy legal tender, or a hardship to preserve legal tender; these are very different, and without investigation, there is no way to diagnose. We secretly believe that the financial authorities of the National Government should do something about this issue, whether it is a positive explanation, a side indication, rigorous implementation, or correction; it must be one of them, and cannot be delayed.

We still want to say something about this phenomenon: (1) Since these banknotes have been rejected, they cannot be forced to be used; therefore, destruction is certainly unnecessary, and hastily devaluing them to seek disposal is also not the right way to proceed; saying that seeking disposal and suffering a great loss is still a minor matter. It is better to keep them and wait for instructions from the financial authorities. (2) In such a situation, the most important thing is for the public to remain calm, endure the pain, and abide by the rules; this is an important belief for reducing national and ethnic difficulties and reducing unnecessary personal losses, and it should not only be the case when disposing of North China banknotes. The impact of the non-circulation of North China banknotes, in North China, on the one hand, almost helps to promote the so-called "Joint Banknotes," and on the other hand, it also alleviates the effect of squeezing North China banknotes; in Shanghai, on the one hand, it causes losses to merchants and civilians holding North China banknotes, and on the other hand, it also makes it impossible for those who bundle North China banknotes to come south to easily obtain general banknotes and foreign exchange. It should be known that the so-called North China banknotes also have a considerable amount in Shanghai, but they are mostly collected and distributed in North China; the separation between the two places often makes the source unclear; normal merchants and civilians who hold large amounts of North China banknotes may exist, but it is still an exception. In everything, benefits and disadvantages go hand in hand, and gains and losses must be weighed; therefore, on this day when the financial authorities have not yet given instructions, the best plan is to wait quietly for instructions.

### Anglo-Japanese Opinions Differ; Second Talk Postponed; London Studies Craigie Report, Both Sides' Newspapers View Task Pessimistically

(London) London has received the report of the initial meeting between the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, and is currently considering it. Reuters has learned that the date of the next meeting has not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(Tokyo) The second meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, which was originally scheduled for this afternoon, has been postponed to Wednesday. It is said that this is due to the late arrival of instructions from the British government to the British Ambassador. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the British government is currently considering the report of Ambassador Craigie to Japan regarding the Tianjin incident and his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Until the British government notifies Craigie of its opinion, the meeting between Craigie and Arita is unlikely to continue. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(London) This morning, all newspapers published the "verbal exchange" between Britain and Japan in Tokyo on Saturday on their front pages. The newspapers are now closely watching for signals of a full debate. News Chronicle diplomatic correspondent Bartlett (MP) called the first meeting between British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita "a long and inconclusive meeting," and said that if the Japanese side insisted (as expected) on the demand that Britain "cooperate" with Japan's "new policy" in China, the British government would likely submit this issue to the United States, France, and other signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty for their opinions. The Daily Telegraph published an editorial acknowledging that the progress of Saturday's meeting has not yet revealed details, but stated that it would not be surprising if it revealed that the two sides had widely divergent opinions on the scope of the talks. If the Japanese side insisted on its attitude, the hope of obtaining good results from this meeting would be slim. The newspaper strongly argued that there was no room for compromise on the true purpose behind the Japanese actions in Tianjin, and that the Japanese anti-British movement's claim that "Japan can complete its conquest of China sooner without British aid" was clearly absurd. The Times said that the Tokyo meeting was unlikely to make much progress until the British government had had sufficient time to consider the information presented by Sir Robert Craigie. If the Japanese interpretation of the attitude of the Japanese army foreshadowed a Japanese attempt to expand the scope of negotiations beyond the Tianjin dispute, the meeting would be unlikely to produce any results and would be deadlocked. The newspaper also discussed other forms of pressure that the Japanese army would impose on the British after the failure of the negotiations, such as anti-British riots by submissive Chinese, saying that if the Japanese side did this, it would not only endanger the British expatriates in Tianjin, but also for various reasons, give the United States the full benefit of a very friendly neutrality to China. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(Tokyo) It is becoming increasingly clear that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita is urging British Ambassador Craigie to discuss general issues concerning China before dealing with the Tianjin incident. The statement published in the Japanese newspapers that Craigie has expressed his willingness to do so is not credible, but Ambassador Craigie will of course have to listen to Arita's views on the general principles that form the background to the current situation in Tianjin. Asahi Shimbun said that there are quite a few gaps between the British and Japanese sides, and it will be necessary to hold several more meetings before a basic understanding can be reached on this issue and the principles involved. Whether the Anglo-Japanese talks can succeed will be clear by the end of this week. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that the outcome of the talks is not optimistic. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Fierce Anti-British Movement Underway in Guangzhou

(Guangzhou) Although the Guangzhou authorities have banned various anti-British actions, a fierce anti-British movement is currently underway. The method is to use Chinese newspapers, leaflets, and pamphlets. Previously, this movement was of a mild nature and was aimed solely at Hong Kong, as evidenced by the Chinese newspapers' claim that the new Chinese government will return the Kowloon leased territory to China by the end of this year. However, in the past few days, anti-British propaganda has become widespread, and anti-British leaflets have been found all over the city. One of them depicts Indians such as Gandhi kneeling before British soldiers, with the title "British Imperialism in India." Pamphlets are distributed everywhere, with slogans such as "Resist with arms to eliminate white imperialism" and "China should recognize British imperialism as its enemy." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese Claim Soviet Planes Attacked Manchurian Border; Eight Planes Bombed Station Twice, Four Passenger Cars Destroyed, Post Office Caught Fire

(Shenyang) There was again activity by both sides' air forces on the Soviet-Mongolian border today. Soviet planes bombed a railway center near Angangxi, the most important railway terminus east of Hailar. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, eight Soviet-Mongolian S.B. bombers bombed Fularji, a junction of international railways inside Manchuria, and at 6:45 last night attacked Haranahier (transliteration), 140 kilometers inside the "Manchukuo" border, dropping dozens of bombs, injuring four civilians, destroying four passenger cars parked outside the station, and causing a fire in the area post office, which was extinguished immediately with no major damage. The glass windows of many residences were shattered by the bombs. Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Army claimed that the bombing of Fularji and Haranahier Mountain by Soviet-Mongolian planes was particularly important because it crossed the border deep into Manchuria. He meant that the Soviet action was to "wash away the shame of the defeat at Nomonhan." Judging from the internal situation in the Soviet Union, he did not believe that the Soviet Union intended to engage in a full-scale war. When a certain foreign visitor asked if the attack on Fularji was by Mongolian or Soviet planes, the spokesman replied that he could not be sure. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Soong Tzu-wen Rumored to Still be in Hong Kong

(Hong Kong) Although Chinese newspapers have reported that Mr. Soong Tzu-wen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, has gone to London on a government economic mission, Mr. Soong is still in Hong Kong. He met with a reporter from a London newspaper last weekend and did not mention any intention of going to London. Although there are rumors that Mr. Soong may leave Hong Kong in the next few days, there is no detailed information. According to the Chinese newspaper report, Mr. Soong will meet with financial circles in London to find ways to impose economic sanctions on Japan and strengthen the position of the Chinese legal tender.

Dr. Norris is well-versed in politics, has unique insights into international issues, and has a deep friendship with Secretary of State Hull." (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Foreign Exchange Control Implemented in Beiping

(Tianjin) The new foreign exchange control plan announced by the Beiping "Provisional Government" came into effect today. It is heard that British merchants do not intend to conduct business in accordance with the methods announced by the "Provisional Government," but merchants from small countries and some German merchants have contacted the Yokohama Specie Bank, which is operating in the Japanese concession, to handle export drafts. According to the new regulations, exporters of various goods, except for seven unimportant goods, must present proof of their goods being transported abroad to sell foreign exchange at a price of 14 pence, and goods being transported to Japan and "Manchuria" must sell Japanese exchange at an equal price. It is generally believed that this move is another blow to foreign trade in North China. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Rumors of Kung Hsiang-hsi's Resignation Completely Groundless

(Chongqing) The rumors circulating in Shanghai that Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi, the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, is about to resign are considered by official sources here to be completely groundless. Similar rumors spread at this time last year, but the facts have proven them to be inaccurate. According to those familiar with the matter, these rumors must have been created by speculators, and their intention is to depress the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender. (Associated Press dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese Merchants on Sakhalin Punished by Soviets; 374,000 Rubles: Togo Protests to Soviets

(Moscow) The Japanese Sakhalin Coal Mining Company was fined 374,000 rubles by the island's primary court for violating its contract with the Soviet trade union. Later, it appealed to the higher court of the city of Aleksandrovsk, which upheld the original judgment. The Soviet side also ordered the company to pay the fine in full by the 19th of this month, otherwise its property would be confiscated. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo Shigenori visited Vice-Chairman Rossovsky of the Foreign Affairs People's Committee yesterday to protest, saying that the Japanese government would safeguard the interests of its people with a firm attitude. In addition to the coal mining company directly requesting the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to revoke the original judgment, it also hoped that the Soviet government would give the Japanese government a reply by the 18th of this month. Rossovsky immediately refused to accept this time limit, but said that the Soviet government would provide a reply when possible. At the same time, representatives of the coal mining company and Soviet miners are negotiating in Moscow to establish a new contract to replace the old contract that expired in December of last year. It is reported that some progress has been made. The Soviet workers' representatives had previously demanded a 40% pay increase since December of last year, but have now accepted a 15% pay increase, but some minor issues remain to be discussed, such as the validity period of the new contract. The Soviet workers' representatives argued that it should be set at one year, starting from December of last year, while the coal mining company argued that since the company has not employed Soviet workers since December of last year, it should start from now and last for one year. There is a dispute between the two sides, and no agreement has been reached. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(Tokyo) A certain foreign reporter asked at a press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today whether the protest lodged by Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo against the Soviet Union's oppression of Japanese who have oil and coal concession rights on North Sakhalin was intended as a warning rather than a protest. The spokesman replied that whether this action should be regarded as a protest or a warning depends entirely on the Soviet Union's mentality. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Elementary School Student Sun Jun Enlists in the Army at Mother’s Command

(Guiyang) Sun Jun, an elementary school student from Longli Bijang, came to Guiyang at his mother's command to volunteer for military service. The Guiyang Military District Office, recognizing Sun's mother, Deng, for her exemplary parenting, sent a special telegram of respect. Also, Wang Mingxiang of Puding competed with his elder brother for service. Huang Zhaojun, a student from Pingba, and Cheng Xiancai, a strong young man from Xingyi, voluntarily joined the army. The bureau also issued orders to commend them all. (17th dispatch)

### Chongqing United Daily News Comments on Tokyo Conference: Anglo-Japanese Relations Worth Noting But Unrelated to the National Policy of Resistance

(Chongqing) Today's editorial in the Chongqing United Daily News, titled "The Anglo-Japanese Conference and China," stated that our nation's final victory in the war of resistance depends on our efforts and sacrifices, not on any changes in the relationship between a third country and our enemy. Before receiving concrete reports, we should not speculate on the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. What is obvious is that Japan wants to use this opportunity to completely eliminate British influence in the Far East. Since the outcome of the conference is related to China, China cannot remain indifferent. Will Britain and Japan reach a private compromise in this conference, or will the conference fail and Anglo-Japanese relations worsen? Although the stated purpose of the conference is to resolve the Tianjin Incident, in reality, Japan wants to use this to seize what Britain has painstakingly built up over forty years. Japan believes that Britain must compromise on a temporary peace. However, Britain's policy of compromise should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Britain's patience is limited, and Japan's violence against the British and its infringement of British interests have far exceeded this limit and scope. Based on common understanding, if Britain refuses to compromise with Japan, the Tokyo conference is unlikely to produce concrete results. The failure of the Tokyo conference will lead to Japan's continued aggression, further worsening Anglo-Japanese relations, and at the same time, promoting greater sympathy and assistance from Britain to China. Even if Britain is forced to adopt a temporary compromise policy towards Japan for some reason, our long-term unified front and the national policy of achieving final victory can also be achieved through our own firm efforts and sacrifices, and will not be affected by changes in the policies of third countries towards the enemy. Our diplomatic policy is to gain more friendly countries, create fewer enemies, to cultivate friendship with righteousness, and to awaken the attention of countries with vested interests.

Among them, the Japanese army suffered the greatest losses and casualties in the battle of Gangkou in the fourth decisive attack, expending more than a thousand shells and leaving more than a thousand bodies behind, but Gangkou remained unscathed. According to my personal battlefield experience, the morale and tactics of the Japanese army in northern Hunan are now far less brave and stubborn than they were during the fierce battle of Taierzhuang.

### US Senator Issues Declaration in Response to Roosevelt's Proposal: Urges Congress to Pass a Bill to Prevent Munitions Aid to Japanese Aggression

(Washington) A faction in the US Congress advocating for the re-discussion and amendment of the Neutrality Act during this session of Congress issued a declaration yesterday after a meeting at the Mayflower Hotel, stating that the most important issue for the United States at present is how to amend the current Neutrality Act, which is not neutral in fact, and abolish the clause prohibiting munitions to belligerent countries, and then prevent Japan's war of aggression against the Chinese people. If this clause prohibiting munitions to belligerent countries exists for a single day, it will please the aggressor country and continue to attack world peace. The American people must support President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull's policy of sympathizing with resistance to aggression. The American people must quickly demand that Congress speedily enact legislation to prevent Japan from obtaining military raw materials from the United States, because although Japan is using these munitions to fight against China today, it will later use them to fight against any other democratic country in the world.

### British Fascist Party's Peace Plan; Mosley's Speech

(London) Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, delivered a speech on his peace plan yesterday before an audience of over 25,000. The key points are four: (1) Britain should cease political activity in Eastern Europe; (2) Western European countries should reduce armaments; (3) Germany's former colonies should be returned to Germany to show that Britain already possesses vast territories and does not need mandated territories; (4) Britain should concentrate its attention on the Empire itself to proclaim to the world that British citizens will defend the Empire to the last person. Sir Mosley believes that if this peace plan could be implemented, it would not only maintain peace in the present but also for generations to come. (Haitong, 17th)

### Southern Balkan Countries Strengthen Relations with Britain; Key Figures from Both Countries to Visit Britain Simultaneously; Diplomatic Talks to Commence Soon

(London) Prince Paul, the First Regent of Yugoslavia, and Mochalov (currently in Paris), the Speaker of the Bulgarian National Assembly, have both departed to visit Britain and are expected to arrive here within days. Diplomatic circles attach great importance to this, saying that the peace front organized by Britain and France in Europe is likely to attract Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, which are also happy to join. The outcome will be known after they hold diplomatic talks with British authorities within this week. Recently, it has been rumored that the governments of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria intend to request commercial credit loans from the British government. If so, the attitudes of the two countries will undergo extremely important changes. According to well-informed sources, Bulgaria has adopted a strictly neutral attitude towards Germany, and even in the case of Yugoslavia, Germany's efforts to court them have failed. Britain should seize this opportunity to prevent Yugoslavia and Bulgaria from leaning towards the Axis powers. It is said that after Bulgarian National Assembly Speaker Mochalov arrives here, he will discuss various commercial and financial issues with British authorities, hoping to increase trade between Britain and Bulgaria. However, it is not yet known whether the talks will extend to political issues. According to the British government's intention, if Bulgaria insists on reclaiming the Dobruja region from Romania, it will be difficult to wholeheartedly support the democratic front, and the British government will not be able to consider granting loans.

### Japan Uses White Russians in "Manchukuo" as a Barrier Against the Soviet Union; Successively Sent to the Outer Mongolian Border; A Small Number of White Russians Have Left Harbin for Shanghai

The Continental Daily reports that the large-scale conflicts on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" are not only a concern for the Chinese, who believe they will inevitably affect the Sino-Japanese war, but also for the White Russians in this port, because many of their relatives still live in "Manchukuo," and now their news is lost. In the past five days, eighteen White Russians, aged sixteen to twenty-two, have arrived in Shanghai from Harbin. They faced great difficulties when leaving "Manchukuo." According to them, the

White Russian Youths

in major cities in "Manchukuo" such as Harbin, Shenyang, Changchun, and Dalian have now been mobilized and sent to the battlefield. Every day, groups of twenty to thirty people are sent to the Outer Mongolian border. At the beginning of this month, an airplane appeared in the sky over northern Harbin, flying very high, causing panic throughout the city. Initially, people believed the plane was a Soviet military aircraft, but it did not drop any bombs. To this day, the nationality of the plane is unknown. People are generally concerned about the

Soviet Bombing

of Hulunbuir. Rumors of a rapid advance by Soviet-Mongolian forces are rampant. Apart from these rumors, Harbin is still peaceful. Little news of the border battles is heard, and only the reports deemed appropriate by the Japanese official news agency are disseminated to the outside world. The White Russians residing in "Manchukuo" now live in a state of anxiety because the Kwantung Army clearly intends to use the White Russians against the Soviet army. A White Russian who recently returned to Shanghai from Harbin spoke to a high-ranking officer of the Japanese Kenpeitai about this matter before departing for Shanghai. That person clearly stated the Japanese side's attitude. According to that

Japanese Officer,

the Kwantung Army believes that the White Russians should welcome the opportunity to "defeat the Communists." Since the White Russians are eager to overthrow the Soviet regime, the Japanese side does not need to inquire about the attitudes of the White Russians residing in "Manchukuo." They will gladly take up arms to resist the Soviet government. However, the number of White Russians in "Manchukuo" has decreased from 100,000 before the Japanese annexation to 25,000, and they have learned from

Painful Experience

the true purpose of Japan in Manchuria. White Russians in Manchuria are employed as laborers, for which they demand higher wages than the Chinese, and as managers, but they are not as good as the Japanese. The Japanese side claims that the reason for the existence of these immigrants in Manchuria is because they are a potential barrier against the Red Army. Therefore, the 25,000 White Russians in Manchuria have become puppet reserves, and when Japan invades Soviet territory, they may be called upon to fight.

### 30,000 People's Army in Lingdong Recovers Chenghai County Seat; Weng Zhaoyuan and Others Engage in Training Strong Young Men

A Swatow dispatch: Since Swatow fell during the Dragon Boat Festival, it has been cut off from news from other ports. British ships passing outside the port of Swatow do not enter anymore because there are no goods to load or unload in Swatow. They stop outside Ma Islet for several hours. The British warships stationed in front of the British and American consulates dispatch speedboats to shuttle back and forth, supplying food exclusively to foreigners and transporting mail.

In the past ten days, the British ship "New Chaozhou" has been running between Hong Kong and Haifeng Shanwei, Lufeng Jieshi, delivering pigs, chickens, eggs, etc. to Hong Kong for sale. Chinese letters are sent out by sailboats, but the cost is high. In addition to affixing enough postage stamps to each letter, one yuan in legal tender is required to be handed over to the "Thousand-Li Horse" (i.e., fast runner) to travel day and night. Departing from Swatow Chao Yang, it may be possible to reach Jieshi or Lufeng the next day, and the letters can reach Hong Kong in three days. The "New Chaozhou" is a ship of the Jie Shun Company on Connaught Road West, Hong Kong, sailing between Hong Kong and Haifeng. British warships often protect the sea. Overseas returnees from the Meizhou region, after arriving in Hong Kong, travel via Shenzhen to Huiyang, then to Laolong Xingning. This route is not safe, because Changping, Zhenlong Jiazibu on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway are in the midst of battle. Without supporting documents, it is difficult to pass. If one takes a boat from Hong Kong to Jieshi, enters Hepo via Hetian, and exits to Fengshun via Wuhua Anliu, although this route is more expensive, it is very peaceful now because there are regular troops suppressing it, and travel is very convenient. Recently, the scope of the Lingdong war has been limited to the area along the Chao-Shan Railway, the tributaries of the Han River, and the coast of Chenghai. A small number of Japanese marines in Chao Yang, Dadun, and Guanbu

withdrew automatically after July 4th. The cadre of strong young men who were previously trained by Weng Zhaoyuan and Chen Shumu in Meizhou are automatically forming joint defenses in various villages. Weng Zhaoyuan was ordered to go to Liusha, Puning, to re-summon the personnel of the former 8th District Command and consolidate the grassroots work, assist the farmers, and rush to harvest the paddy fields so that the new grain can be brought to market early. Liu Zhilu also arrived in Chenghai, Sunan, Zhanglin, and Donglong to summon the cadre of strong young men, assign work, and implement joint village defense. Chenghai City fell on June 30th. At that time, the Japanese army advanced in two routes. The Masaki unit took more than 30 speedboats and towed 20-30 civilian boats down the tributaries of the Han River. The Takeda unit attacked Ouding from Swatow and then divided its forces to attack Chenghai. The county seat was attacked by land and water. The defending military police scattered to Guanshan Township, Beilong, Henglong, Chenghai Nanyang Township, the Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Stoves, and the Wai Sha Si Jiwei. These areas were originally haunted by pirates and bandits. The bandit leader Wang Xiyue (a native of Nanyang Township) surrendered to the Japanese army and served as the captain of the special investigation team. The old bandit subordinates of Li Li, Wang A'wu, and Chen Ke Dang, numbering more than 300, were all incorporated by Wang Xiyue into plainclothes special teams, carrying knives and guns on their waists,

rampaging through the countryside. They were born and raised in this hometown and knew who was wealthy and who was the village chief. Therefore, they preyed on the elders of this hometown. A village chief surnamed Li in Shangzao was kidnapped and sent to the Japanese army in Chengcheng, and later redeemed for 8,000 yuan. More than 50 strong young men over the age of 20 were arrested and sent to the Wang Family Ancestral Hall. Each person was extorted at least 200-300 yuan. Those who could not raise the money were sent to the Japanese military camp and identified as plainclothes guerrillas and more than ten were shot. Women aged sixteen to twenty-four, those who were slightly beautiful, were escorted to the Japanese military camp in Swatow. Boys under the age of six were also snatched away. Many women and children were taken from Wu, Ouding, and Qishan and imprisoned in empty buildings on Yongping Road, Swatow. On the evening of the 5th, the six

major surnames of Du, Li, Wang, Cai, Yu, and Chen held a meeting and immediately mobilized the strong young men's team and captured five or sixty of the bandits who were acting as special investigation team members. Very few escaped. Nanyang Township has 30,000 residents and thousands of strong young men, who cooperated with the Sunan guerrillas, crossed the river, and attacked Chenghai City without any effort, recovering the city. The Japanese troops on the North Dike, hearing gunshots in Beilong, did not know the truth and all fled to Swatow on boats.

Chongqing Municipality Controls Prices and Plans to Establish Public Sales Offices; Builds Markets in the Suburbs

A Chongqing dispatch: The Chongqing Municipal Government is actively proceeding with the construction of suburban markets and joint business offices. It has decided to raise 3 million yuan for the construction of suburban markets. All construction matters are handled by the construction committee established by the Dredging Committee. Joint business offices have been decided to be established in two locations. More than 200 stores have joined the business. Stores participating in the business are currently renovating shop fronts and moving goods. After everything is ready, it will open. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is now planning to establish public sales offices and city markets. The establishment of public sales offices aims to manage the goods in the market, regulate their availability, and control their prices. This public sales office will adopt a system of official supervision and merchant management, that is, it will be operated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, supervised and directed by the Social Affairs Bureau, and has requested a loan of one million yuan from the local banking community as funds. The banking community has given its agreement in principle. As for the city market, its form is similar to the temple fairs in Beijing and the flower fairs in Chengdu, but this is a long-term nature. In the future, both small and medium-sized capital merchants and vendors can request to participate in the business. It is said that the above two plans are sufficient to supplement the deficiencies of suburban markets and joint business markets, and further enable the flow of goods and facilitate supply and demand. Also, from the perspective of the actual situation in Chongqing, since the Municipal Government has been striving to restore the market and regulate supply and demand for more than a month, the prices of general daily necessities have been gradually stabilized.

### American Ambassador Uses "Hesitant Stupidity" to Criticize a Few Americans

A Chongqing dispatch: Recently, French Ambassador Cosme and American Ambassador Johnson arrived in Chongqing one after another. Grand tea parties were held here one after another to warmly welcome them. The French Ambassador was welcomed at a tea party held by the China National Diplomacy Association at the Sheng Sheng Garden on June 21st. At the welcome reception held by the Sino-American Cultural Association at Fanzhuang on July 1st, the American Ambassador's reply was earnest and full of interest. Chairman Kong Xiangxi delivered a welcome speech, saying that the Ambassador was the first representative of friendly countries to travel on the Yunnan-Burma Road and must be very interested in China's recent transportation development. The majority of the American people sympathize with China's resistance against Japan, which can be seen anytime and anywhere. The examples are too numerous to mention. Recent public opinion polls show that 74% of the American people express their willingness to help China, only 2% can be considered pro-Japanese, and the remaining 24% can be said to be still unclear about the relationship between China and Japan. One of the purposes of the establishment of the Sino-American Cultural Association is to make these 24% of friendly people understand the actual problems involved in the Sino-Japanese War and hope that they will turn to jointly support China. Ambassador Johnson replied, praising the Sino-American Cultural Association as a very meaningful organization, wishing its unlimited development in the future, and at the same time, after being able to make great efforts in the culture of China and the United States, he targeted Chairman Kong's words, seriously and humorously, to make his wonderfully unsurpassed speech, saying that in December last year, he heard of a newly built road reaching the Burmese border. Because he was lucky, he was able to pass through the road during his vacation back home. His companions were Major McHugh and an experienced Chinese chauffeur. It only took 12 days from Chongqing to Yangon, and there were no accidents along the way, but he felt that he had gone through a scenic spot. However, there was an "accident" that occurred, that is, when passing through a certain place, he saw two chickens on the side of the road. Seeing the car was about to pass, one of the roosters wanted to cross, but quickly passed. The hen initially had a hesitant attitude. When she decided to follow her partner, it was no longer possible. Because he immediately laughed and said that he had no intention of discussing moral

issues in this kind of "accident," or perhaps the stupidity of this follower can represent the psychology of 24% of Americans. In conclusion, he expressed his joy in returning to his old team and thanked Chairman Kong and others for their kindness.

### Rich Mineral Deposits in the Virgin Land of Xikang; Li Huang, Huang Yanpei, and Others Return to Sichuan

A Chengdu airmail report: Li Huang, head of the Sichuan-Xikang inspection group of the National Political Council, and Huang Yanpei, the deputy head, led the inspection team of the southern route, departing from Rong in the spring, to inspect the Ningdu area, a treasure virgin land in Xikang Province.

Lasting Two Months,

they traveled through more than a dozen counties, deep into the wilderness, and inspected the actual situation. Now the official work has been completed, and they have returned to Rong via Xichang and Ya'an. Mr. Li Huang spoke with a very optimistic attitude, talking about the excellent impressions gained from the inspection of the counties in the Ningdu virgin land of Xikang. He holds unlimited bright hopes for the future of the development of Ningdu treasures. He said that the land in Ningdu is fertile and the treasures are abundant. If they are fully developed, they can be comparable to any powerful country in Europe and the United States. As far as mineral products are concerned, gold, silver, copper, and iron are all available throughout the territory, and the quality is excellent. The iron ore in Mianchi and Lugu has an iron content of 60% and iron reserves of

30 Million Tons.

In addition, Hu Boyuan, a technician from the Ministry of Economic Affairs who accompanied the inspection, is a well-known mineral master in the country. According to him, to develop the treasures of Ningdu, one should first start developing light industry to decide to proceed with building heavy industry. The silk, leather, sugar, and cotton of Ningdu exported from Kunming every year reach 200 yuan. If the government advocates and encourages planting, the output will increase, and the prospects for export trade can be optimistic. As for heavy industry construction, the government already has a

Complete Plan.

However, the current obstacles to development are transportation and opium addiction, which are of great importance. The construction of highways and the prohibition of opium addiction are being actively worked on by the central government and the Kang Provincial Government, and they can be completed. The virgin treasure land of Xikang is Ningdu in the southeast. Ningdu includes Xichang, Mianning, Huali, Yanyuan, Yanbian, and other counties.

### Finance Market: Buying Trend Strengthens in the After-Market; Foreign Exchange Futures Tighten

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, with HSBC's listed prices, remained unchanged. The informal trading of British and American currencies showed stability. The spot market conditions were considered stable. In the afternoon, due to some settlements by foreign firms, the American dollar slightly tightened, but later returned to stability. The settlement of the British pound was also finalized. Futures initially loosened but then tightened; initially, HSBC released Hong Kong telegrams for sale, and it was rumored that banks in North China had stopped using banknotes in the city to prevent a certain party from using North China banknotes soon to arrive in Shanghai to acquire foreign exchange. For a time, speculators were helpless. Therefore, although Sassoon and Japanese banks continued to buy, supply still exceeded demand, causing the market to loosen significantly. The British pound once loosened to 6 pence and 21/875, and the American dollar also hardened to 12.09375 yuan. However, soon after, due to the continued aggressive purchases by Japanese banks and no purchases by Hong Kong telegrams, but HSBC was unwilling to sell further at this time, the market became even tighter. By the close of the evening, the British pound was 6 pence and 34/375, the American dollar was 12.375 yuan, the August British pound was 6 pence and 06/25, and the American dollar re-entered the 12 yuan mark at 11.8125 yuan. Therefore, the swap spread was very wide, and interest was favorable, but no transactions were heard to have occurred. Spot and current month transactions were sparse, while August transactions were quite heavy. As for the Hong Kong dollar, it continued to harden due to strong buying interest from foreign firms.

August Futures Trading Particularly Active

At the beginning of the morning, London's spot and forward prices were flat, New York's silver prices remained unchanged, and London's raw gold also remained steady. Exchange rates: British pound against US dollar was slightly lower by 0.6 hao, against Shanghai unchanged, against France slightly lower by 0.1 centime. US dollar against British pound, against Shanghai, and against France all remained unchanged. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, banks' spot selling prices were: British pound at 6 pence and 56/25, American dollar at 12.78125 yuan, both unchanged from the previous Saturday afternoon close. After the opening, foreign firms first bought HSBC's spot British pound at 6 pence and 56/25, and then bought American banks' spot American dollar at 12.78125 yuan. The market was extremely calm. After HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it was still exempt. Subsequently, the Netherlands offered favorable August British pound at 6 pence and 18/75. Later, HSBC's selling interest in July and August futures was also strong (reportedly commissioned by Hong Kong). Therefore, although Japanese banks and Western merchant Sassoon and others frequently absorbed, the position was still ample, causing the situation to harden. It is estimated that HSBC sold current month British pound to peer banks at 6 pence and 43/75. Subsequently, a certain bank offered current month American dollar to peer banks, hardening from 12.5 yuan to 56/25. At that time, HSBC also offered August British pound to Japanese banks and Western merchant Sassoon, hardening to 6 pence and 21/875. At the same time, August American dollar also loosened to 12.09375 yuan. After that, because HSBC's selling interest weakened, coupled with the continued purchases by Japanese banks, and it was heard that Hong Kong telegrams were also active, the underlying trend turned flat. Japanese banks then bought favorable August British pound at 6 pence and 15/625. Subsequently, Hong Kong telegrams also absorbed foreign firms' August British pound at 6 pence and 12/5. Later, Hong Kong telegrams and Chinese merchants and speculators successively bought foreign firms' August American dollar at 12 yuan and 11.9375 yuan. Nearing noon, the Netherlands sold spot Hong Kong dollar to foreign firms at a price of 44.125 yuan, and the situation slightly hardened. Extending to the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices for both British and American currencies were the same as the morning opening. The current month British pound remained at 6 pence and 40/625, the American dollar at 12.4375 yuan, the August British pound at 6 pence and 12/5, and the American dollar at 11.9375 yuan.

Spot Settlement Unchanged

In the after-market, foreign firms continued to buy HSBC's spot British pound at 6 pence and 56/25, and also bought a certain bank's spot American dollar at 12.75 yuan. The market situation was flat for the British pound and slightly soft for the American dollar. At that time, foreign firms such as HSBC were still very reluctant to supply futures, but their appetite was excellent, causing the market to tighten. It is estimated that a certain bank absorbed Bombay Silver Company's current month American dollar at 12.4375 yuan. Subsequently, Sino-Belgian also absorbed Chinese yarn and flower merchants' current month American dollar, softening from 12.4375 yuan to 37/5. Later, McAllister absorbed peer banks' August British pound at 6 pence and 70/9375. At that time, foreign firms such as Anderson were still willing to supply spot Hong Kong dollar at a price of 44.125 yuan, but no transactions were heard to have occurred. Extending to the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were: British pound at 6 pence and 56/25, American dollar at 12.78125 yuan, current month British pound at 6 pence and 34/375, American dollar at 12.375 yuan, August British pound at 6 pence and 06/25, and American dollar at 11.8125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous weekend, the spot British and American currencies remained unchanged. The current month British pound tightened by 06/25, the American dollar softened by 06/25, the August British pound shrank by 06/25, the American dollar appreciated by 12/5. The Hong Kong dollar hardened by 12/5 when calculated at the last price.

### Rumors of Sharp Drop in Tianjin Gold Prices: Impact: The Local Market Once Plunged; Foreign Exchange Tightens: Causes a Buying Trend and Rebound

Yesterday's cash gold informal market situation was unpredictable. The overall situation was roughly stable initially, then fell, and then recovered to stability. At the initial opening, money changers suddenly sold aggressively (it was heard that the market was rumored to have sharply dropped in Tianjin gold prices, only worth 2,600 yuan in Korean notes, and only worth 2,210 yuan in legal tender. However, this may be due to the inferior quality of the gold bars, etc. There was no such large difference from local gold prices). However, because silversmiths, local wealthy merchants, and Hong Kong merchants suddenly bought in, supply and demand were balanced, and there was little change. By noon, the market seemed to lack support and fell to close at 2,604 yuan. In the afternoon, the futures exchange rate reported a decrease, which triggered a buying trend. The Guangdong merchant group and local wealthy merchants had a strong buying interest, and the price rose to 2,622 yuan. The result closed at 2,619 yuan, equivalent to the previous weekend's noon closing price. Trading was still active, with about 1,000 taels traded throughout the day. Silversmiths' jewelry gold initially fell and then rose, ultimately with no change. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Cash Gold Settlement Without Change

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened fairly flat. The opening price was slightly lower by one yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels to gold shops at a price of 2,618 yuan. After the opening, although money changers frequently sold aggressively (reportedly selling on behalf of Tianjin merchant groups), the Hong Kong merchant groups had not yet absorbed it, and local wealthy merchants also had an appetite, so the market was extremely mediocre. Money changers and peer banks mutually traded 20 taels at a price of 19 yuan. At the same time, money changers sold another 100 taels to silversmiths (on behalf of wealthy merchants) at a price of 18 yuan. Subsequently, they also sold 100 taels to a certain silversmith (on behalf of Hong Kong merchant groups) at the same price. Soon after, silversmiths bought another 50 taels from money changers on behalf of wealthy merchants at a price of 20 yuan. At that time, the buying interest suddenly faded, and the price fell sharply, instantly dropping by six yuan. Money changers mutually traded 20 taels at a price of 14 yuan. After that, securities firms suddenly developed a buying trend, and the price briefly recovered slightly. Securities firms bought 100 taels from money changers at a price of 17 yuan. Then, they bought another 50 taels from money changers at a price of 16 yuan. At that time, securities firms stopped buying and observed, and others had no appetite, causing the price to decline again, soon falling by eight yuan. Cash gold shops sold 50 taels to a certain silversmith at a price of 08 yuan. Later, money changers bought another 50 taels from a certain broker at a price of 11 yuan. At noon, money changers mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 05 yuan, and a certain silversmith returned 50 taels to the gold shop at a price of 04 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange futures suddenly tightened, which triggered a buying trend, causing the market to gradually recover. The opening price immediately rose by six yuan. Money changers bought 10 taels from silversmiths at a price of 10 yuan. At that time, sellers became increasingly scarce, instantly raising the price by nine yuan. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from silversmiths at a price of 19 yuan. Subsequently, money changers mutually traded 10 taels at a price of 18 yuan. Later, a certain silversmith bought 50 taels from money changers at a price of 20 yuan. Soon after, money changers mutually traded 10 taels at 22 yuan, which was the peak of the day. After that, sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing the price to fall slightly. Money changers mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 21 yuan. At 3:01 PM, silversmiths mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 2,619 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, there was no change compared to the previous weekend's noon closing price. The price fluctuated by 18 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand gold was 2,625 yuan, and the buying price was 2,610 yuan. The current mark-up gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.

Silversmiths' Jewelry Gold Initially Small, Then Large

The exchange rate for silversmiths' jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. At 12:01 PM, because cash gold weakened, it was also lowered by one yuan. Later, at 3:50 PM, because cash gold suddenly rebounded, it also rose by one yuan. As a result, there was no change. It is estimated that major peers still quoted 265 yuan, new peers quoted 263 yuan, and bought in at 257 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Remained Unchanged

The market prices of the Central Bank remained unchanged. It is estimated that the buying price for Chinese cash remained at 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao, the listed customs gold remained at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li, and the Shanghai standard mark-up price also remained at 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao. This was due to the London telegram of the 15th, which showed that the British pure gold remained unchanged, at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5.5 pence per ounce.

### Bank Clearinghouse: Reduces Interbank Lending Rate

The Shanghai Banking Association Clearinghouse, from yesterday (July 17th), revised the interbank lending rate as follows:

Interbank Transfer Withdrawal Rate: 2 jiao, 1 fen

Interbank Transfer Deposit Rate: 1 jiao, 6 fen

(Calculated per 1,000 yuan per day)

"Note" The interbank transfer withdrawal rate was 2 jiao, 5 jiao on July 4th, then changed to 2 jiao, 3 fen from the 10th, and now changed again to 2 jiao, 1 fen, a decrease of 4 fen. The interbank transfer deposit rate also decreased accordingly, both being 5 fen lower than the interbank transfer withdrawal rate. As for the interest rate on public debt clearing and the discount rate for 90-day accepted drafts, there have been no changes since the 4th, remaining at 2 jiao, 8 fen for national currency and 2 jiao, 5 fen for interbank transfer.

### Rediscount Rate Rises Again: Demand for Cash is Strong; Final Rate at 109 Yuan

Yesterday's rediscount rate for interbank transfer bills continued to rise. Initially, it was still around 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan, but later, seeing the strong demand for cash absorption, it rose sharply to 106 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it rose further to a final 109 yuan, 9 yuan higher than last week. As for the Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate, it gradually decreased after the use of interbank transfers. Yesterday, it was slightly lower by 2 fen, at 1 jiao, 6 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### US Dollar and Pound Sterling: Rise More Sharply

Last Saturday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Yesterday, in this city, foreign firms settled accounts heavily, foreign banks' supply was smooth, and market prices were stable without change. Cash gold opened stably at a price of 2,618 yuan. Later, Tianjin merchant groups' supply suddenly increased, retail demand was sluggish, and market prices fluctuated downward. The noon closing price was a low of 604 yuan. In the afternoon, cash gold shops and money changers bought at low prices, and the market situation stabilized. The opening price was 2,610 yuan. Forward exchange rates tightened, customers' confidence strengthened, and buying enthusiasm increased. Market prices rose, returning to their previous levels. The evening closing price was 19 yuan. As a result, there was no change compared to last Saturday. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were in strong demand, and supply was not smooth. The British gold pound was flat, and the American gold pound rebounded more sharply. British gold notes were actively traded, and market prices fluctuated. British gold notes rose, and American gold notes fell slightly. Because spot exchange rates were stable, they could not advance sharply. The supply of Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, etc., increased, and market prices eased. Dutch guilder notes and rupee notes were in strong demand and continued to trend upward. The supply of Japanese gold notes was quite smooth, and the market situation was weak. The evening price was 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 1 li. Korean won was rarely supplied and demanded, and the market was stable, remaining at 8 jiao, 5 fen, and 5 li. Transactions at the association were rare. Only Xiang Kang sold 100 pounds of British gold notes to Yongfeng. Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes rose by 2 fen, American gold pound rose by 4 jiao, American gold notes fell by 1 fen, Hong Kong notes fell by 5 li, French franc notes fell by 1 li, Singapore notes and Canadian notes each fell by 2 fen, Australian gold notes fell by 1 jiao, Dutch guilder notes and rupee notes each rose by 1 fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Legal Tender Position Becomes Tighter; Domestic Bonds Struggle to Rise; Foreign Stocks Also Lack Vitality

Yesterday's securities informal market situation felt sluggish. Because of conflicting news, people were bewildered. One piece of news was the talk of British and American loans, but it was still just speculation. The other piece of news was that cracks had appeared in the British-Japanese conference, and the situation in Europe was becoming increasingly tense. Market sentiment was initially firm but then softened. There was still no reliable news about the Seventh Installment of principal and interest. Long investors were hesitant, mainly because credit was still too tight. The monthly interest on foreign exchange arbitrage could reach as high as 5-6 fen. Cash was fleeing, and the amount was alarming. The legal tender discount rose to around 110 yuan. Furthermore, banks were not accepting banknotes from other provinces. As a result, the legal tender position became increasingly tight, credit became tighter, and long positions found it increasingly difficult to develop. The market situation became increasingly sluggish, and it was not easy to be optimistic about the trend due to the complex environment. Yesterday's situation was initially firm but then weakened. Both buyers and sellers were not enthusiastic. Buyers were Hengfu, Runli, and Lianhe, and sellers were Tongkang, Shuntai, and No. 14. Transactions were extremely quiet. Therefore, the results were mixed, with fluctuations of only 5 fen to 1-2 jiao. The 96 bonds, which had not been traded for over a month, suddenly started trading, more than 6 jiao lower than the previous price. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 200,000-300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to Previous Day

Unified Bonds	59.10	58.80	59.10	Up 0.25

Unified Bonds B	49.85	49.75	49.85	Up 0.10

Unified Bonds C	48.60	48.25	48.30	Down 0.05

Unified Bonds D	47.70	47.55	47.60	Up 0.05

Unified Bonds E	48.00	47.80	47.90	Down 0.10

96 Bonds	5.90	……	5.90	Up 0.60

In stock trading, 50 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 12 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen.

The Public Traders Association reported that yesterday's stock market continued to be weak and lifeless due to the impact of the tightening of forward foreign exchange. Buyers were all hesitant, and transactions were scarce. Only Jardine Matheson shares had slight demand, with a price of around 17 yuan and 9 jiao. The closing buying price was also that price. English Shanghai Land shares were still noticed, with a price of 18 yuan. However, transactions for all items were negligible throughout the day.

### Shanghai Suspends Use of North China Legal Tender

(1) Cautious Action

Since yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications have temporarily suspended accepting legal tender from North China (such as Tianjin, Shandong, Qingdao, Jinan, etc.) due to the high exchange rate of Tianjin Shanghai exchange. As a result, the industrial and commercial circles in this city also refused to use this legal tender. The event of this city refusing to use legal tender from North China also occurred once in March last year. Later, because the Bank of China and Bank of Communications accepted it as usual, the trend quickly subsided. For more than a year, people had gradually forgotten about this event. Unexpectedly, this decision, due to the continuous rise in Tianjin Shanghai exchange, reaching a maximum of 138 yuan (i.e., 138 yuan of Tianjin legal tender to pay 100 yuan of Shanghai legal tender, recently 132-3 yuan), had to refuse to accept it in order to block the southward flow of North China legal tender, prevent the two banks' losses on exchange, and cut off the path for speculative merchants to make profits.

Moreover, the significance of suspending the use of North China legal tender is not limited to this. Upon reviewing the fluctuations of Tianjin Shanghai exchange in recent months, they have all shifted according to the difference between foreign exchange in Tianjin and Shanghai. In the past, the distance between exchange rates was limited, and Shanghai exchange could still maintain its balance. However, in the past month, Tianjin has been affected by the Japanese military blockade, and people's hearts are weak. Foreign exchange has changed, losing its normal course. The lowest record was when the British exchange softened to 4 pence 75, and the American exchange was only 9 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen (on the 8th and 10th of this month). Compared with Shanghai's market, British exchange was still maintained at 6 pence 5625, and the American exchange was still maintained at a level of 12 yuan 78125. If we can use this exchange rate arbitrage, selling foreign currency in Tianjin, receiving legal tender, and finding a way to transport it to Shanghai to replenish foreign exchange, the profit would be abundant in one turn. However, given the special circumstances, although we know that it is so, we cannot ask for it. Those who can operate freely are, of course, only a few special figures. Such exchange rate arbitrage not only affects the foundation of legal tender but also damages the foreign exchange fund. The Bank of China and Bank of Communications' resolute suspension also has its unavoidable difficulties. We should not rashly add any criticism.

However, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the past issuance boundaries have long been eliminated, and the number of legal tender from North China flowing into this area is also not small. This decision, coupled with the suspension of use, although it is heard that there is a saying of changing to pay North China drafts, only a small number of people can temporarily remit to Tianjin and Beijing to wait for a better opportunity. However, those small workers and small merchants who hold this small amount of legal tender have not made adequate preparations in advance, and will probably not know where to go. If they do not seek a solution soon, they will only give villains an excuse to slander legal tender, which is extremely unwise. It is hoped that the authorities of the two banks will pay attention to this.

(2) Ying Jun

North China Bank of China and Bank of Communications legal tender has been generally usable in the market recently, but since the Bank of China and Bank of Communications stopped exchanging North China banknotes yesterday, it was like a bolt from the blue, and the entire financial world has taken this issue as the center of discussion, while the general public holding banknotes are unaware. It is said that it is due to exchange rate market conditions, in order to prevent speculators from taking advantage. Upon investigation, the biggest difference between Tianjin and Shanghai exchange rates was on the 8th of this month, with a price of 138 yuan, that is, 138 yuan of Tianjin legal tender is equivalent to 100 yuan of Shanghai legal tender, that is, 1 yuan of North China legal tender is only worth 7 jiao, 2 fen, and 4 li of Shanghai legal tender. As of last Saturday (the 15th), Tianjin Shanghai exchange had risen back to 132 yuan, which is equivalent to a little over 7 jiao and 5 fen of Shanghai legal tender. Yesterday's price was 133 yuan, which is also equivalent to over 7 jiao and 5 fen. However, the Bank of China and Bank of Communications did not declare in advance and stopped exchanging yesterday, making it impossible for the general public and the poor to exchange the banknotes they received. The smoke and exchange shops took the opportunity to collect exchange fees. It is said that yesterday, every 100 yuan required a fee of 10 yuan, only exchanging 90 yuan, and some even exchanged at 70%. According to the latest report, the total amount of Tianjin banknotes issued is 322,242,605 yuan. The list is as follows:

As of June 17, 1939

Bank Name	Issuance Amount

Central Bank	36,593,505

Bank of China	162,233,100

Bank of Communications	78,500,000

Four Banks	1,500,000

China Industrial	1,750,000

China Agricultural and Industrial	1,500,000

China Reclamation	90,000

Zhejiang Industrial	20,000

Da Zhong Bank	56,000

Hebei Provincial Bank	50,000,000

Total	322,242,605

Except for the Central Bank banknotes of 36,593,505 yuan that did not have a place name printed, the amount of banknotes printed with the Tianjin place name was 295,649,100 yuan, of which the Bank of China and Bank of Communications accounted for over 240 million yuan. Currently, in the Shanghai market, since the recent bank withdrawal trend, various banks have paid out a lot of miscellaneous banknotes from North China and other provinces. If they stop exchanging immediately, the general public will suffer considerable losses. It is hoped that the authorities, at this time of legal tender unification and sufficient preparation, will continue to use them uniformly regardless of place name in order to avoid affecting the credit of legal tender. We should also allow a few days' grace period, on the one hand, to publish a notice in the newspaper to inform the general public, no longer to receive and use it, and to allow a deadline for exchanging Shanghai legal tender in order to avoid unexpected losses.

### Yarn and Fabric: Transactions Among Peers Greatly Reduced; Cotton Yarn Rises and Then Falls; Guangdong Merchants' Appetite is Also Satiated

The yarn market started strong and then retreated, and the situation was peaceful. This is because of the continuous demand for coarse and fine yarn in the South China area, which is developing residential areas. Transactions among peers, buying and selling, have been greatly reduced, probably because financial contraction and shortage of cash chips have greatly constrained the power of activity. The changes in market prices have also entered the normal range. Sales are good, the market rises, sales are sluggish, the market is weak, and the range of ups and downs only hovers between 4-5 yuan.

The morning opening of spot yarn market did not have major transactions, and the opening was slightly soft. The price of 20-count double-strand yarn outside the warehouse was 487 yuan. The Hong Kong merchants bought 40-50 bales, and the warehouse receipt price was not opened. A short time later, the customer merchants' appetite for spot goods did not weaken, and people's hearts were lifted. The selling price increased and gradually rose again. The Yunnan merchants' purchase of coarse yarn was also prosperous, and the demand for 23-count and 21-count fine yarn was also not weak. The 20-count double-horse yarn outside the warehouse once reached 491 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 485.5 yuan. By the time of closing, it was heard that the Guangdong merchants' Wanxing Company had satiated its appetite and spat out floating profits, and it immediately fell back again. The closing price of 20-count double-horse yarn outside the warehouse was 488 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was 481 yuan. As a result, the turnover for half a day was 1,640 bales. The market price of 20-count double-horse yarn did not have much difference compared to the previous day, but the 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn was 2-3 yuan higher than the previous day. The 10-count coarse yarn was also firm. Hongzhang Factory opened 200 bales of 10-count New Bao Yi yarn at a price of 410 yuan, with delivery in August. Yesterday, 18 pieces of cotton yarn came from Ningbo. Today, 370 bales are exported to Tianjin.

Hong Kong	795	Yunnan	325	Jiangxi	70

Wenzhou	20	Peers	395	Inland	35

Statistics	1,640

The Japanese yarn market opened in the early morning, continuing to advance and rise, carrying on the enthusiasm of the previous day. The 20-count Moon Qin yarn appeared outside the 400 yuan mark. Soon after, due to bad news and quiet actual sales, it fell back again. By the closing price, the 20-count Moon Qin spot was priced at 400 yuan to 399 yuan.

### Cash Chips Become Shorter; Cotton Transactions Become Quieter

The external cotton market price: The New York cotton market was quite tired due to the weekend. Long investors closed positions and reversed short selling, causing the market price to sink. Later, due to telegrams from Mumbai reporting a drop, and the spot prices in the South were weak. The US government signed an agreement in England on the 23rd of last month to borrow 600,000 bales of American cotton. Because the price situation is complex, it is said that there may be a delay in execution. As a result, New York fell by 8 pounds, and India fell by 1 rupee together with the forecast. Egypt's market closed.

Since the telegram from Malaysia, external cotton transactions in Shanghai have become increasingly difficult. Yesterday, the local city had a large amount of banknotes with place names from North China. In order to prevent the purchase of foreign exchange, the use of these notes was suspended, causing the amount of legal tender chips to become even scarcer and payment upon arrival to become even more difficult.

Domestic cotton transactions were quiet, and not a single transaction was made. Because goods were scarce and factories had a shortage of legal tender, they also had no intention of buying, so they entered a state of stagnation. Judging from the current state, the future of the cotton market will be difficult to develop in the short term. Today, only peer banks purchased 200 pieces of Pingguoer at a price of 75.5 yuan, with banknotes delivered at the warehouse. The source of Su Bei cotton was also declining, and only 63 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived.

### Piece Goods Autumn and Winter Fabrics: North-South Spot Sales Gradually Active; Eastern Goods Rise in the Morning, Fall in the Afternoon

National Cloth

Yesterday, the spot sales of white cloth on the market remained sluggish. When sales did occur, prices were generally loose and low. Fine cloth and fine twill each fell by 10-20 cents per piece, while coarse cloth fell by 5-10 cents per piece. Coarse twill maintained its original price due to the limited inventory. Spot sales of autumn and winter colored cloth, colored twill, and flannel from both northern and southern regions gradually showed activity, and sales prices were particularly firm. More than 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, plain and patterned straight goods, broadcloth, and satin were transacted yesterday for Nanjing and various ports along the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 3,000 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and broadcloth, as well as more than 400 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan added more than 2,800 pieces of colored cloth, patterned cloth, patterned flannel, and khaki. More than 1,500 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, printed cloth, satin, and fine cloth were purchased from Xinghua port and Taizhou in northern Jiangsu. Shipments from Tianjin in the north have been quite active in recent days. However, past orders have absorbed a large quantity, so they are temporarily focused on delivery, and new transactions are lacking. Wholesale shops in this district only have scattered replenishment business.

Eastern Cloth

The sales prices of fine cloth and fine twill in the morning market continued to rise, and the upward trend was strong. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth was selling for $13.75 per piece. Later, news emerged that foreign banknotes were not circulating in the market, and the discount rate for Shanghai banknotes rose sharply. Dealers in Wood Street were suddenly stunned, and the market softened again. "Dragon Head" spot prices fell to $13.60, with the current month at $13.70 and the next month at $14.00, still an increase of 10 cents per piece compared to last week's prices. In total, about 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were transacted. The Eastern Cotton Mill continued to offer 200 bales of 12-pound flower fine cloth, which were ordered by dealers.

Exports

On the 17th, 14 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin. On the 18th, 65 pieces were exported to Tianjin.

### Grains Sales Slightly Active, Flour Prices Quietly Loosen, Wheat Only Purchased by Japanese Merchants

Flour Yesterday's spot flour transactions were slightly active. In addition to small-scale transactions by local and inland merchants, both northern and southern merchants showed interest. However, many frowned upon spot cash prices, as cash was scarce and discount rates for drafts remained high. Yesterday, returned "Fan" flour was selling for only $4.95 (draft price) in the market. It was rumored that some mills were also selling drafts, but it could not be confirmed, as local dealers still needed $4.65 in cash. In total, over 20,000 bags were transacted, mainly in small-scale transactions. The market outlook is becoming looser. Today, 4,000 bags were exported to Dagu.

Wheat The supply of wheat continued to arrive yesterday and the day before. In addition to some being put in warehouses, more and more were seeking to sell on the market. However, Chinese mills were not buying, Japanese mills had limited demand, and transshipment merchants rarely inquired, so the market was difficult to improve. Although buyers and sellers initially held their ground, the price eventually dropped by 1.5-1.6 cents, with Nanjing wheat selling for $6.25 and Pinghu wheat for $6.23, totaling over 400 bags, still purchased by Japanese merchants.

### Price Limits Reduced, Medium and Low Grade Thin Rice Rises Instead

Du Geng Yesterday, the rice market announced that, in order to regulate food prices, the Public Concession and French Concession authorities, after convening representatives of the association for discussion, decided to continue to lower rice prices. Starting from July 15th, all transactions will be calculated based on the original transaction prices. The highest price for japonica rice should not exceed $20 (national currency) per stone, and the highest price for "Kejian" should not exceed $16 per stone. Other varieties are subject to separate arrangements. Transactions exceeding the price limits will not be recognized, and reports can be made to the police at any time for investigation and punishment to maintain food supply. Therefore, the market was still calm in the early morning, and the situation seemed weak. However, dealers in this district suddenly started buying cheaply, and the market gradually stabilized. As a result, the prices of thick japonica rice stabilized, while the prices of thin rice, except for high-quality rice, remained unchanged. The medium-grade rice was suitable for dealers, and the prices were raised by 2-3 cents. The spot sales of "Du Yangjian" and port rice were limited and the market was stable. In total, about 10,000 shi were sold, with the source of supply being 2,300-2,400 bags from He Xia and South Port merchants, as well as Changzhou and Fengjing.

Ke Xian Yesterday morning's market was sluggish and continued to fall. Later, the sales of "Gengjian" revived and improved. As "Rongxian" had lower prices, dealers focused on it. The subsequent sales were unexpectedly high, and market sentiment improved again. Except for old orders, where prices were still lowered by 1-2 cents, high-grade rice rose instead, with Nanjing Xian reaching $15.67 and Wuhu Xian reaching $15.45. The total daily turnover was more than 4,000 bags, mainly purchased by local dealers. Inland villages only made small purchases. The price limit for Xian rice should not exceed $16, which was announced and implemented yesterday.

Foreign Rice Initial price of $21.50, later $21.70. A total of over 400 bags were sold in the market.

Bian Yuan The supply remained limited, and prices seemed to have bottomed out, so the market was stable and weak.

### Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Decline by Another 20-30 Cents

Broad Beans High and Stable, Inferior Quality Soft

The market for miscellaneous grains was largely stagnant, weak, and with short-lived upticks due to various environmental factors. Yesterday, news spread that foreign banknotes were not circulating, which further hindered transactions in the market. Credit was tight, and purchasing power was weak, so prices frequently declined. Yellow bean prices fell by another 20-30 cents. Three cars of Dalian Sipingjie beans were priced at $9.80 for warehouse goods, and $9.70-$9.65 for goods from outside warehouses. The destination was inland markets. In addition, local merchants purchased 400 bags of Hankou Zha beans for $8.70-$8.65, and over 50 bags of Pudong Du beans for $11.35 for extra-large grains, $10.03 for medium grains, and $9.80 for ordinary grains. There was some interest in trading broad beans, so the market was generally high and stable, but lower quality beans weakened. Yesterday, over 700 bags of Wujiang green-skinned broad beans were transacted for $6.05-$6.00, 300 bags of Maojiashi green-skinned broad beans for $6.65, and $7.00 delivered, and 50 bags of Nanxiang green-skinned broad beans for $6.30.

### Sugar Market Domestic Sugar Shows Signs of Slight Recovery

According to London telegrams, the sugar market recently rose one point for August, to 7 shillings and 2.5 pence, slightly down by 0.25 for December, to 6 shillings and 2.725 pence, and unchanged for March of next year. The trend of the local association's pricing was stable. No. 24 coarse white sugar was still priced at its original level. Transshipment goods were at $20.80, with 100 bags transacted. Taikoo car white sugar also showed little change. B mark West warehouse was at $30.60, with 50 bags transacted. East warehouse called for a price, DJ mark at $29.45, 100 bags. Dutch red sugar was slightly down by 1-2 cents, with spot goods at $22 and transshipment goods at $16.10. It was rumored that domestic sugar shipments from Shantou would be transported by Japanese ships. If so, the supply would not be cut off for long. Therefore, merchants from Guangdong and Fujian both lowered their prices, as sales have been very limited recently, and merchants have been hesitant to aggressively buy.

### Silk and Tea Raw Silk Telegrams Report Price Increases, Zhili Silk Slightly Traded

There was no market in New York on Sunday. Yokohama spot price was 1,250 yen, recent price was 1,224 yen, and forward price was 1,160 yen, an increase of 3-11 yen compared to last week's closing prices. The impact of overseas silk sales on the local market remained weak, mainly due to the dumping of Chinese silk by a certain party in Europe and America. This party was selling Shanghai white filature 7/8 at eight cents to one dime lower than that of Shanghai foreign merchants in New York. Therefore, although a portion of spring cocoons has arrived in Shanghai, the future of Chinese silk seems difficult to develop smoothly before the victory of the war.

In the local silk market, the telegraph price of Shanghai white filature was $2,220, but no transaction was made. The Xinfu and other firms purchased 180 piculs of Zhili grade six silk for $1,220, which can be considered strong. There were small transactions of native silk in Indian firms, with prices fixed and unchanged.

### Imports and Exports Many Goods Arrive from Ningbo

Among the goods arriving in Shanghai, there were 1,825 tins of tung oil from Tianjin, and 850 pieces of soybean oil from Yantai. More goods arrived from Ningbo, including 12 pieces of tobacco leaves, 120 pieces of leather oil, and 1,690 pieces of native paper.

### Banknotes with North China Place Names No Longer Accepted in Shanghai Yesterday To Prevent Japanese and Puppet Regimes from Transporting Funds to Acquire Foreign Exchange, China and Communications Banks Have Reported to Headquarters by Telegram

In order to prevent the transport of legal tender with Tianjin place names to Shanghai for the purpose of buying foreign exchange, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have had to impose certain restrictions on banknotes with Tianjin place names. However, a small number will still be exchanged as usual. It is reported that the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have reported to headquarters and requested instructions. The details are as follows:

Total Amount of Tianjin Banknote Issuance As of June 17th of this year, the amount of Tianjin banknotes issued totaled $162,233,100 by the Bank of China, $78,500,000 by the Bank of Communications, $36,592,505 by the Central Bank, $1,500,000 by the Four Banks, $1,750,000 by the China Industrial Bank, $1,500,000 by the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, $90,000 by the China Reclamation Bank, $20,000 by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, $56,000 by the Dazhong Bank, and $50,000,000 by the Hebei Provincial Bank.

Temporary Restrictions to Prevent Transport Starting yesterday, banks and money shops in Shanghai refused to accept banknotes with Tianjin place names. At the same time, stores, companies, and cigarette shops refused to accept banknotes with North China place names, including Tianjin, Shandong, Beijing, Qingdao, Jinan, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, resulting in many rumors in the market. A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from relevant sources that the legal tender of the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank of China does not have place names, so it is uniformly accepted throughout the country. In order to prevent the transport of legal tender with Tianjin place names from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for the purpose of buying foreign exchange, certain restrictions have had to be imposed.

Small Number Still Exchanged as Usual The Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications still exchange a small number of banknotes with Tianjin place names as usual. It is also reported that the exchange rate between Shanghai and Tianjin is 1,300 Tianjin legal tender to 1,000 Shanghai legal tender. At the same time, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai is six and a half pence for the British pound, while the exchange rate in Tianjin is only five pence. Therefore, unscrupulous merchants transport legal tender with Tianjin place names from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to Shanghai, exchange it for legal tender with Shanghai place names, and buy foreign exchange on the black market. The purpose of this restriction on exchange is to prevent the transport of legal tender with Tianjin place names to Shanghai.

Report to Headquarters and Request Instructions It is also reported that in addition to imposing restrictions on exchange, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have reported the situation to headquarters and requested instructions. This restriction is a temporary measure and is not related to the entire Chinese monetary system. As for the issuance of Chinese legal tender, its reserve fund and cash have always been above 60%, and the guarantee is below 40%. The high cash reserve is the highest among all countries. The issuance of legal tender during the war has been extremely cautious and has never relied on a paper money policy, which has already been proven by facts and does not need to be repeated.

No Need to Panic or Doubt About the Stability of Legal Tender After the news of refusing to accept legal tender with North China place names spread throughout the city, citizens who were not aware of the truth could not help but be surprised and doubtful. According to news from the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, the banks still accept banknotes with North China place names if they only account for 8-9 yuan out of every 100 yuan. If the amount is larger, they will be refused. This measure is neither a formal refusal nor a change in the Chinese legal tender system. It is an automatic measure to sanction unscrupulous merchants. As for the entire legal tender, the reserves are sufficient. The government has always maintained the statutory price of the legal tender exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence, which is evident. Therefore, citizens do not need to be alarmed.

Small Circulation in Shanghai After all industries in Shanghai refused to accept banknotes with North China place names, various sectors were concerned about whether this move would affect finance. According to a financial magnate, although banks in Shanghai used to accept banknotes with North China place names, the number circulating in Shanghai was small. Citizens who held these banknotes mostly exchanged them for Shanghai place names. Although the number of banknotes with North China place names in the market has increased recently, most of them are owned by unscrupulous people. Therefore, refusing to accept them will not cause any loss to citizens, and the entire financial system will not be affected.

### After the Circulation of Interbank Drafts, Check the Amount of Guarantee; The Balance of the Drawdown Account Can Be Used as an Overdraft for the Draft Handled by Each Bank and Industry Through Consultation

Since the Ministry of Finance restricted withdrawals, the banking and money industries have been handling interbank drafts to stabilize the market and assist industry and commerce. The Money Exchange Association has begun to evaluate, implement inspections, and announce the interest rates on interbank drafts and draft deposits. In order to facilitate commercial turnover, each bank and money shop is allowed to use the balance of the drawdown account to offset an equal amount of overdraft for the draft. The details are as follows:

Separate Meetings After the Joint Bank Reserve Committee handled the interbank drafts for each bank and money shop, it hired experts to organize an evaluation committee, divided into real estate, securities, and goods groups. The chairmen of the three groups, Qian Xinzhi, Bei Songsun, and Tang Qimin, respectively convened representatives of each bank and money shop to propose the prices of prepared properties and stipulated that the amount of interbank drafts used by each bank and money shop should not exceed 70% of the evaluated amount of the guarantee. If the market price falls, the guarantee may be recovered at any time.

Implementation of Inspections After the five groups, namely the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Money Exchange Association, the Foreign Banks Association, and the China, Communications, Agriculture, and Farmers' Four Banks, each sent a representative to form the Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Interbank Draft Preparation Inspection Committee, the committee decided to implement inspections at the end of July. The types and amounts of collateral for each bank and money shop's interbank draft preparation will be announced at any time to demonstrate credibility. Personnel have been dispatched by the Bank Reserve Committee to assist in handling the affairs of the Inspection Committee. As for the prepared properties for each bank and money shop's interbank drafts, they will be managed by the Custody Committee.

Various Interest Rates The Joint Bank Reserve Committee announced that in order to set the various interest rates of the committee from July 17th, any changes will be announced later. The interest rate for official bills is 2.8 cents per thousand yuan per day in national currency, the interest rate for drafts is 2.5 cents per thousand yuan per day, the discount rate for accepted drafts with a 90-day term is 2.8 cents in national currency, and the discount rate for drafts is 2.5 cents. The interest on interbank drafts used is 2.1 cents per thousand yuan per day, and the interest on interbank draft deposits is 0.5 cents less than the interest on interbank drafts used, which is 1.6 cents per thousand yuan per day. In addition, the interest owed on interbank draft loans made by the association before July 4th is 2.5 cents per thousand yuan per day.

Drawdown Balance Offset A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the banking industry that the Shanghai Hardware Industry Association has difficulties in operating due to the restrictions on withdrawals by the Ministry of Finance's Ma Telegram. Therefore, it is suggested to use the drawdown balance deposited in the bank to offset an equal amount of overdraft for the draft, that is, to repay the draft overdraft at any time with the income from the draft, in order to facilitate commerce. After the Bankers' Association consulted the opinions of various banks, it was heard that each bank considers the suggestion to be very thoughtful for the purpose of facilitating commercial turnover. However, it can only be handled more simply by each bank and the merchants in the industry who have dealings with each other through consultation.

### Anti-British Movement Begins in Various Villages in Jiangwan Listing Anti-British and Anti-Communist in the Same Breath; Obvious Planning in the Launching and Instigation

The China Press reported that in many villages in Jiangwan, under the instigation of the Youth League in the city center, a major anti-British movement began on Saturday and Sunday. According to the New Shen Bao, the league was established only about a month ago and has renewed its efforts to "expand" the organization of the anti-British movement. The rally held in Jiangwan on Saturday and Sunday shouted anti-British slogans and distributed leaflets of the same nature, attacking the British and communists. The last slogan meant that the spirit of self-government of Shanghai youth is developing. These people want to establish a political affairs office in Jiangwan, similar to those existing in Pudong and other places. The demonstrators issued a lengthy proclamation calling the British "cunning" and lacking "international credibility."

### Japanese Troops in Caohijing Search House by House

According to people from Caohijing in western Shanghai, the local Japanese troops recently received reports that a large number of guerrillas had infiltrated the area, causing them extreme panic. Therefore, they went to the countryside to search house by house and interrogate them strictly with the puppet "police" the other day. Three Hakka men, all coolies, were arrested because they had not obtained a residence permit from the "police station." They were deemed to be suspected and were detained and imprisoned in the Japanese military headquarters.

### Japanese Buddhist Monks Induce Chinese Children

Japanese Buddhist monks from Nagasaki have come to China across the sea in large numbers. After arriving in China, they went to various occupied areas to pray for the souls of Japanese soldiers who died in China. At the same time, they also took the name of helping poor Chinese children, and tried to take in poor children between the ages of six and ten, teach them Japanese and Buddhist scriptures, and then take them back to Japan to increase their population after they were assimilated. This kind of work is carried out by Japanese monks in the areas where the Japanese army is stationed on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The "Japanese Buddhist Joint Association" has been generally established in various places to induce Chinese children to join.

### Song Ziwen Flies to England Huge Loan Will Be Completed Song Still in Hong Kong, Ready to Go to England Britain Plans to Lend China 10 Million Pounds

Since China's two years of resistance, the economic structure has been consolidated, and the legal tender exchange rate has always been maintained. International credibility has increased. Now, the United Kingdom and the United States have decided to continue to provide economic assistance. Song Ziwen is preparing to fly to England, and Chen Guangfu is staying in the United States. China will soon receive a huge loan, and the entire financial system will improve. The details are as follows:

Legal Tender Exchange Rate Always Maintained After China implemented the currency reform policy, the entire financial system gained a solid foundation. Although the war has been extended for two years, the 60% cash reserve of legal tender has increased without decreasing. The exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence has always been maintained. Recently, in order to strengthen foreign exchange management, although there have been changes in the settlement methods for imports and exports, the exchange rate difference for exporters and the balancing fee for importers are still calculated based on the statutory exchange rate.

Great Benefits for Foreign Businessmen The smooth implementation of China's legal tender policy is due to the joint cooperation of the national financial community and compliance with laws and regulations, but the United Kingdom and the United States have also provided considerable assistance to China, such as the United States' purchase of Chinese silver, a $25 million loan to China, and the United Kingdom's loan to China and the establishment of a £10 million stabilization fund to stabilize the foreign exchange market and consolidate the legal tender foundation. Therefore, foreign businessmen operating in the Far East, whether directly or indirectly, have received great benefits.

Song Ziwen is Still in Hong Kong According to a message from the Shanghai financial community, the Bank of China Chairman, Mr. Song Ziwen, flew from Hong Kong to London, England. His mission is important, and its purpose is to contact the British financial community, increase loans to China, and strengthen the international credibility of legal tender and balance foreign exchange rates. However, as of yesterday afternoon, Mr. Song was still in Hong Kong. The Shanghai financial community has not received a telegram that Mr. Song has left Hong Kong for England, but it is understood that Mr. Song has prepared to go to England. It is difficult to predict when he will travel.

China Will Receive a Huge Loan The development of the $25 million loan from the US Export Bank to China last year has been very satisfactory, according to Mr. Pearson, the president of the bank. Therefore, a new loan to China is very likely. As for the UK loan to China, it is also in progress, with a total amount of about 10 million pounds. According to general speculation, China will continue to receive new loans from British and American giants in the near future.

### Japanese Ships Sail as Scheduled

Since the Japanese army landed in Shenjiamen and Dinghai last month, all foreign ships sailing between Dinghai and Ningbo have been forced to stop. The Swedish Ruifeng Company's Xinanli ship once tried to resume sailing on the 6th of this month, but was intercepted and turned back by a Japanese warship. It is now reported that in order to dominate shipping rights, the Japanese have organized the "Daxing Company" and the Hainan Company, and sent the Japanese ships Baiwumaru and Yangtze River to set sail for Dinghai, Wan Daitian, and Shenjiamen at 4:00 p.m. today. However, it is not yet certain whether they can achieve their goals.

It was transported by the Italian ship Cortellazzo and entered the port at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong to unload.

### Six Days Adrift at Sea: A Story of Renewed Life

The "North-China Daily News" reports: A Chinese fisherman from Nanao Island, near Shantou, encountered pirates over a week ago. He was robbed and thrown into the sea. Fortunately, he clung to a bamboo raft. After drifting for six days, his clothes were torn to shreds by the waves, and he suffered greatly from hunger and cold. However, on Friday, he was rescued by the American mail steamer "President Pierce." Yesterday (the 16th), he disembarked in Shanghai and was taken to the President Lines office on Guangdong Road, where he was questioned.

Overjoyed

He was dressed in neat American Western-style clothing and carried two suitcases filled with fine American garments. Moreover, his pockets were filled with US dollars, generously given to him by passengers of the "President Pierce." His joy was undoubtedly boundless. Little is known about the fisherman, as he speaks the Nanao dialect, which no one understands. Several people tried to interpret his words, but to no avail. Furthermore, he is illiterate and does not speak any other coastal languages or English. However, after much effort, it was learned that his boat had been

Seized by Pirates

And he had been thrown overboard. The "President Pierce" rescued him at 23.40 degrees north latitude and 118 degrees east longitude. At the time of his rescue, he was naked and severely weakened by the storm. After eating on board, his strength quickly recovered. The passengers, moved by his plight, showed him great sympathy. As the President Lines staff could not fully understand his experiences, they decided to take him to several Shantou hotels in the city last night to have his words deciphered. He will now be

Carried to Hong Kong

By the "President Coolidge" to return to his hometown on Nanao Island. According to inquiries made by a reporter last night, the President Lines staff, after taking him to a Shantou hotel, discovered his name, age, and details of his unfortunate experience. The fisherman's name is Wu Ying (transliteration), and he is only twenty-seven years old. He and six other fishermen were robbed by pirates while sailing. He was thrown into the sea and drifted for six days. The fate of his companions is unknown. The "President Pierce," fully loaded with cargo and passengers, was sailing to Shanghai and Japan. Sixteen hours after departing from Hong Kong, the fisherman was spotted by the ship's watchtower and rescued. He was treated in the ship's infirmary, causing the mail steamer to be

Delayed by One Hour

It is scheduled to leave Shanghai today (the 17th), heading to various ports on the Pacific coast via Japan.

### New US Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Hepburn Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon; Admiral Yarnall Arrives Today From Qingdao; Change of Command Ceremony Next Week

Rear Admiral Hepburn, the new commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, arrived in China on July 5th aboard the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Company from Honolulu with his family to assume his new post. It is now known that the ship is scheduled to arrive at the port at 2 PM tomorrow (the 19th), and the new commander will disembark at

Customs Wharf around 4 PM. The ship will be berthed at buoys eleven and twelve. At that time, US Consul General Gauss, Captain Fegen of the Fourth Naval District, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze Patrol, and outgoing Admiral Yarnall, arriving from Qingdao, will

### Stealing Half a Day: Collective Report

Two: Joy and Sorrow

On the roads, everyone must pay attention to "safety first." In the Zhaofeng Park, however, visitors don't seem to worry about this at all.

You see, there are men, women, old and young, some walking arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder; some holding onto each other's sleeves, looking around as they walk; others are solitary visitors, alone, circling the park. They possess the spirit of the lone hero. But while being alone is good, being in pairs or groups is even better. Their walking postures are always staggered, with varying speeds. It's rare to see "little angels" walking straight or diagonally, marching properly.

Several of us originally planned to meet by the pond. As soon as I entered the park, I headed straight for the pond. I saw a gentlemanly man, around fifty years old, carrying a toy sailboat in his right hand, held under his arm. The boat was over three feet long, with three triangular sails. Seeing this scene, I thought of the owner of the sailboat. As I was looking around, I suddenly heard hurried footsteps behind me, and the sound of "Daddy..." carried by the wind. The innocence, sincerity, and joy were fully expressed in the simplest two words a son uses to call his father.

It was a father and son. They had reached the pond before me. The old man gently released the sailboat into the water for its "launching ceremony," and the little one clapped and cheered, once again exclaiming "Daddy!" They circled the pond. In this miniature space, I discovered several different types of visitors. For example, in the northwest corner, on a low mound overlooking the pond, there were several chairs placed close to the shade of the trees. A couple was already sitting side by side, whispering sweet nothings. With an attitude of "disinterest," I spied on their "uncontrollable" performance. In a "glimpse," I saw the woman slightly leaning forward, her back not touching the chair. Her eyes were fixed on the "river of love" at her feet. The man sitting next to her had his right arm resting on the back of the chair, giving her a pretend half-embrace. There was only the distance of a tongue between his mouth and her ear. Judging from their expressions, the man seemed to be explaining something in great detail, while the woman seemed to be answering sporadically, or perhaps not answering at all. Although I couldn't hear her words, her body language was full of silent messages like those in a silent movie.

Yesterday at noon, there was a slight drizzle. The raindrops were like wind to the ears of this couple, and they remained motionless. As I walked slowly, I saw a solitary foreign visitor. He was wearing a winter woolen hat, a worn-out navy blue serge short jacket, and trousers of a color that words cannot describe. His leather shoes, because they had not been polished for a long time, were dry and haggard, just like the complexion of their owner, six feet above them, both showing signs of "absolute frustration." Although this person was also being hit by raindrops, he sat still, staring blankly at the pond water, without any energy. But I couldn't bear to spy on him anymore. If sociologists in large cities want to compile "A Corner for the Poor," I can guarantee that they can get very real and rich experiences from his mouth. He is undoubtedly an unemployed person who is still breathing and demanding "survival." (Xiang Shi)

Bamboo Path

Pond

Three: Each with Their Own Interests

Mr. N disappeared into the depths of the woods, leaving Ming'er and me to wander by the pond, waiting for our agreed-upon friend.

The wind stirred the waves of the pond, and toy sailboats rose and fell in the rolling waves. An old man, over fifty years old, was playing with a slightly larger sailboat alone. Perhaps because the boat was too light, its two sails were raised high, losing its center of gravity, and its sailing was not smooth. Unable to withstand the invasion of the wind and waves, it suddenly capsized in the pond. Three foreigners came, carrying cameras, and aimed at the sailboat. But the boat repeatedly overturned in the water, and they finally failed to capture it in their lenses. The foreigners left disappointed, and the old man seemed to feel disappointed too, so he took the small sail and disappeared sadly by the pond.

A Western child was playing with a smaller sailboat, sailing quickly. Sometimes it drifted in the middle of the pond, and sometimes it sailed swiftly to the other shore. The child was busy running back and forth on both sides of the pond. The pond water and the sailboat became the bright world in the child's consciousness. Every spring and summer, Westerners in Shanghai go yachting on the Yangtze River, but now that Western child can enjoy the beautiful pond all by himself.

Mr. S, with a sense of humor, arrived late. He was sent to find Mr. N, while I continued to wander with Ming'er under the thatched pavilion at the right end of the pond. Ming'er saw the clean stone steps and insisted that I accompany her to jump up and down, walking back and forth. She seemed to have a special affection for the stone steps, more interested than the Western child's sailboat.

Walking along the bank of the pond to the other side, we suddenly met Brother Gu. And Mr. S also came. But Mr. N had not been found, and now only Brother Yan, nicknamed "Saraci," had not come. Mr. S and I searched for the missing Mr. N and strolled to another pond, where there was an earthen mound and tall buildings outside the garden, shielding it from the wind. The wind seemed smaller. Lotuses bloomed in the pond, and long fish swam in the green water. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to hold a fishing rod and fish. Wouldn't that be even more leisurely?

Crossing the small bridge, circling the pond, we returned to the original pond. Brother Gu was still chatting with his friends on the chairs. Mr. N also came, and we proposed that Mr. S take a photo. Mr. S first took two landscape photos by the pond, and everyone suggested going to the newly built small mountain.

The children were playing with small airplanes on the wide lawn. Coincidentally, a giant iron bird came in the sky. The children sat down on the ground, staring up at the iron bird in the sky. In their small consciousness, perhaps they had already flown their toy airplanes and caught up with the giant iron bird.

A group of girls were building a human pyramid on the music stage, and another girl was setting up a tripod to take pictures.

Young men and women were hiding on chairs in the depths of the trees, talking about love. Obviously, visiting the park varied according to each person's age, consciousness, and thoughts.

People like us, who are so-called middle-aged or older, don't seem to have the courage to whisper sweet nothings. But this doesn't mean that people over middle age no longer talk about love; seeing a tree, a bridge, some flowers, lush forests and bamboo, and swimming birds and fish, seems more interesting. Mr. N suddenly stopped and said, "This place is spooky. Don't go in." Seeing the two stone horses and two stone figures in front of the door, I deeply

Curving and winding, we arrived at another secluded place. I felt that the environment was so harmonious. We strolled on the undulating lawn, and the newly planted bamboos had mostly been blown down by the wind and lay on the ground. The angles of the stone steps on both sides were very harmonious. Mr. N guessed that he wanted to go back. The sun was faintly hidden in the clouds, and with the wind carrying a few drops of rain, we walked out of the park. I took a few photos, my interest undiminished. Mr. N pressed the camera and took a close-up of the "mountain road." We crossed and walked to a low, old house called "Zhaofeng Village" under the shade of a large tree. Many tourists were eating there. Mr. S wanted to go in and take a look. "Stealing half a day" by visiting a park for two hours and writing a piece of "irrelevant resistance" is probably not a crime, right? (Zhi Zhi)

Four: Peace and Joy

The layout of this park is quite grand. The entire park uses trees as its bones, gravel roads as its veins, and lawns as its main body. It can be described as boundless and all green. Psychologists say that green represents peace and joy. Therefore, when visitors enter the park, they immediately feel refreshed, peaceful, and harmonious upon seeing the lawn.

People in the city, especially those in Shanghai, are constantly tense, busy with work, taking trams, riding elevators, and entering offices, busy all day long. The entertainment they provide is nothing more than indulging in food and drink at restaurants, dance halls, and movie theaters, with no time to spare. There are even merchants who bury themselves in their desks, holding counters and calculating all day long. If they take the time to walk on the lawn here, at least half of the anxiety in their minds can be reduced.

Banana trees are green, roses have not yet bloomed. South of the stone bridge in the west of the park, on the path to the zoo, hydrangeas are planted everywhere. North of the bridge, the flowerbeds are mostly herbaceous. I once visited the East Railway Club in Harbin and saw the green grass in front of the music stage, several inches high, with the four characters of the China Eastern Railway planted in red carnations, interwoven in the center of the grass, splendid and brilliant, looking like an expensive Turkish carpet from a distance, extremely magnificent. But it was too extravagant, stimulating the psychology of the visitors. Zhaofeng Park is different. It is a winner with its cleanliness and beauty.

Pine trees are shrubs, which do not wither in winter and remain green all year round. Their size is also quite large, making them most suitable for planting in parks. The Zhaofeng Park has needle-shaped pines, and the one by the pond is the most spectacular, towering like a canopy, looking like an exquisite pagoda from a distance. Looking closely, it is more than a foot around, with needles spread flat, layer upon layer. If you lie under the tree and look up at the scenery in the sky, it is like living deep in the white clouds, forgetting the noise outside.

The pine groves on the west side of the lawn are a great place for visitors to cool off. In the northwest corner, there is a grove that is smaller and denser, like a green gauze curtain. Young men and women often sit here knee to knee, whispering sweet nothings. When we pass by here, we can't help but think of this small paradise. We don't know how many loving couples who would rather be mandarin ducks than immortals have been created here, and we don't know how many young people have shed so many tears of passion here. (Changchun)

### The Origin of Happiness Between Couples

The reason why couples come together is nothing more than to pursue happiness in life. Although a solitary man or virgin can live a life of ease, they each feel a sense of lonely incompleteness in their heart. This incompleteness cannot be compensated with money or status. It must be filled with the person in their heart—their lover. There are many men and women in the world suffering from lovesickness, which causes them to wither, lose weight, and even age. However, as soon as the person in their heart arrives, their spirit and body are immediately restored. We don't need to use distant facts as metaphors. Just look at a couple who marries for love. Because their long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, they are mutually happy in body and mind, and a new interest in life arises. They will inevitably perk up their spirits in their studies and careers, work together with one heart, and move forward. How happy and meaningful this is!

However, in fact, there are also many married men and women whose bodies and minds decline, whose love is nonexistent, and who fall into the abyss of life's pain. What is the reason for this? According to medical judgment, it is mostly because men committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in their early years, or indulged in excessive licentiousness after marriage, consuming too much of the seminal fluid (semen) that governs sexual health. As a result, metabolism decreases, development stagnates, and the three major nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sex organs weaken. When the sperm gate loosens, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm and infertility, and neurasthenia occur one after another. Such husbands often exhibit weakness and incompetence in their married life, or are completely unable to perform sexually. This not only sacrifices their wives' precious youth, but also causes their own hearts to ache. The happiness between couples is like a fleeting dream. After the dream, what remains is nothing more than the hideous face of a demon!

The only remedy, according to thousands of cases of famous doctors around the world and my many years of experience, is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素). This medicine can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. Its effects are the same in summer as in winter. After continuing to take it for half a month, it can also promote development and regulate metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms can be completely cured. Only those with spermatorrhea must also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (希米脫氏固精片) (available at Wing On, Sincere, Western medicine departments, and Wuzhou Sino-French pharmacies) to stop leakage and achieve rapid results!

Patient Zhao Xing, from Jiangning, is 31 years old. He suffered from severe premature ejaculation and impotence. He also had nocturnal emission during sleep. Last month, he sought treatment from me. I prescribed a large dose of "Sheng Zhi Su" and made him take it with "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian." In less than a week, the nocturnal emission stopped. Now, a month later, his body has completely recovered to perfect health. This is truly what is called "facts speak louder than words."

### Young Men with Spermatorrhea, Quickly Embark on the Path of Self-Renewal

— Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases

Opportunity will never wait for us; we must wait for opportunity. If opportunity is missed, even if we use all our strength, it may not come back. Then, regret is in vain!

Learning in youth and acting in adulthood are all special and important tasks in our various stages of life. Therefore, all young people must make great efforts to lay the foundation for our academic and career pursuits. The vastness of academic knowledge and the multitude of careers in the world mean that even if we devote our entire lives and strive to the utmost, we may still fall short. How much more so should we not waste the golden age of youth? However, while there are indeed awakened young people, there are also many who are not! For example, how many young people in the spring of their youth commit masturbation and licentiousness? Know that masturbation and licentiousness most easily damage the sexual nerves, causing the sperm gate to loosen, and the terrible disease of spermatorrhea then follows.

Semen is the source of our happiness and the element of life. Physiologically speaking, semen is gonadal fluid. In addition to being stored in the seminal vesicles specifically for the needs of love and reproductive function, its endocrine secretions can directly permeate the blood, irrigating the whole body and having the functions of regulating metabolism, promoting development, and nourishing the nerves. Now, if spermatorrhea is left untreated for a long time, the gonadal fluid will inevitably be depleted. Then, symptoms such as incomplete development, premature ejaculation, impotence, brain decay and forgetfulness, neurasthenia, and fear of cold and heat will follow. Such young people will not only be sinners in the love between men and women, affecting fertility and losing all happiness, but they will also miss the opportunity to study. Even if they are strong, they are already old, and are nothing more than decadent parasites in society!

The only remedy is to take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (希米脫氏固精片), which is the most effective treatment. According to the evidence of famous doctors around the world and my many years of experience, this medicine can strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves after taking it, and it has the effect of curing spermatorrhea immediately. If you have the above-mentioned symptoms due to spermatorrhea, you must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素) to nourish the brain and kidneys and increase sperm and blood. Continuing to take it will surely restore perfect health in a short period of time. If the sufferer can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.

### A Passionate Woman Will Inevitably Have High, Erect Breasts

— Yao Chongpei, MD (USA)

Dr. Samaller, a famous American physiologist whom I had the pleasure of meeting once, once said: "A passionate woman will inevitably have high, erect breasts." Initially, his words aroused a lot of suspicion. Later, he wrote an article "Breasts and Love" published in a women's magazine. Only then did people understand why he said this, based on the fact that the development of a woman's breasts is entirely due to the strength of the gonadal ovarian function. Because gonadal ovarian function is the general hub of all the glands in women, if it can be healthy and strong, it will produce a large amount of endocrine secretions in the body. This endocrine secretion can promote the development of female characteristics. In terms of body shape, the most obvious thing is that the breasts are high and erect, and the nipples are sandalwood in color, like the top of a cone-shaped mountain. In addition, the hips must also be very plump, and the body will be graceful, forming a healthy, beautiful, and multi-faceted curve that is so intoxicating! In terms of emotions, due to the vigorous metabolism, they often appear lively, exquisite, quick-witted, and passionate. Such women, because of the gentleness and health and beauty of their character and physique, are praised by everyone in social interactions and are praised as social stars. And once they get married, they are also a typical virtuous wife and good mother, filling the family with joy. The husband respects her as a heavenly being. That is truly so glorious and gratifying. However, in the past, those who committed masturbation and chest binding, or had irregular menstruation, persistent leukorrhea, malnutrition, or serious illnesses, causing the gonadal ovarian function to be unhealthy, affecting breast development, would not only be sick and painful, lose their beauty, but also be disgusted by men, and even abandoned! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素), which is the most effective treatment. This medicine is made from the secretion of the gonads and ovaries of strong animals. Therefore, it can nourish the ovarian function, enhance metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop leukorrhea within one day and night after taking it. Continuing to take it will surely make the breasts high and erect, the hips plump, the cheeks rosy, and youth will last forever in a short period of time.

### The Reason for the Sudden Recurrence of Gonorrhea

Many cases of gonorrhea appear to have been cured on the surface without the patient's awareness. However, upon closer examination, it cannot be said that these cases have been completely cured. On the contrary, this phenomenon is not a good sign, but rather a seed for future recurrence. Based on my many years of experience, once gonorrhea becomes chronic, patients often mistakenly believe they are cured. They then act recklessly, and when the virus suddenly erupts again, they are at a loss, wondering how they could have contracted "white turbidity" (a symptom of gonorrhea) without engaging in prostitution. They are truly like a perplexed monk. In reality, many of these patients took incorrect and inferior medications indiscriminately at the onset of gonorrhea, driving the toxins inward, or underwent poor surgical procedures that forced the gonococci to escape inward. This led to various secondary or concurrent complications. For example, in acute gonorrhea with white turbidity, the gonococci often cluster in the anterior urethra. At that time, the inflammation is severe, making local surgery impossible to perform, and even if oral medications have no side effects, they are too slow to be effective and do nothing to help. Moreover, delaying treatment and turning an acute condition into a chronic one only makes matters worse.

Therefore, the secret to a quick cure for gonorrhea lies in not taking over-the-counter medications privately, not undergoing surgery casually at facilities with mediocre equipment and shallow experience, and in the patient taking good care of their health. Then, use specially made autogenous vaccines to increase the body's resistance, while also taking chemotherapy and using German filtrate electrophoresis therapy to completely and directly eliminate gonococci hidden in the reproductive, urinary, and circulatory systems. In this way, any gonorrhea can be completely cured within a limited time.

### Hollywood Casino Employee Arrested for Impersonating Official in Extortion Scam

Lei Yong (also known as Lei Wenkui), a native of Nanxiang, currently works at the Hollywood casino in western Shanghai. He was originally an employee of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. After the National Army retreated westward, he joined the casino and mingled with the likes of pig herders. As the saying goes, "one who touches ink becomes black," so Lei has also become increasingly depraved. Recently, under the guidance of a colleague surnamed Su at Hollywood, he forged a badge and hat emblem of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Engineering Department, using the alias "Gao." He printed business cards with the self-proclaimed title of "Special Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Construction Department" at the bottom. Every day, in addition to serving his time at the casino, he would scout out factories, shops, and residential buildings with awnings or mezzanines in western Shanghai. Upon finding such constructions, he would pose as an inspector, using the pretext of inspecting building permits to extort money. Merchants, seeing his Western-style suit and conspicuous badge, dared not equate him with ordinary hooligans. Lei got his way, and since acquiring these two illegal sources of income, his coffers have swelled considerably. On the third day of last month, he learned that the Hu Xinji Thermos Factory at No. 636, Xiaoshadu Road, near his residence, had built a new awning in its courtyard. He immediately went to see the factory owner, Hu Xincai, and employed his usual tactics of intimidation and extortion, demanding to see the building permit. Hu had not applied for a permit for the awning, so he could not comply. He then pleaded with Lei to handle the matter. Lei initially demanded 35 taels of silver, but after repeated haggling, Hu was extorted 24 yuan in national currency. Unexpectedly, as soon as the fake inspector left, the real inspector arrived. Hu then realized he had been deceived and handed the card with Lei's alias "Gao" to the inspector, who took it back to the police station for investigation. Last Saturday, Hu was passing Kang Nao Road when he spotted Lei heading to the Hollywood casino. Hu immediately had him apprehended by a Chinese constable at No. 3088 and taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. After questioning, the police chief sent detectives to search Lei's home at No. 85, Lane 617, Xiaoshadu Road, where they found pre-war documents from the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau, Lei's business cards with his fabricated title, over 90 yuan in cash, and a bank deposit book, all of which were brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Hu Xincai was summoned to escort Lei to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that the defendant had impersonated an official to commit fraud and that the seized badges and other items were forged by the defendant. He also said that the bank deposits and cash needed to be investigated to determine whether they were obtained through fraud. He requested an adjournment of the case. Hu also recounted the circumstances of the defendant's impersonation and extortion. Judge Dai then examined the seized items one by one and questioned Lei. The suspect confessed to working at the Hollywood casino and admitted that the badge was purchased from a person surnamed Su in Chengdu Road and that he had offered to arrange a fake permit for Hu. As a result, he was ordered to be detained for further investigation.

### Oil Shop Robbery: Owner Shot

Zhang Jinming, a 21-year-old native of Songjiang, runs the Tongxingyu Oil Shop in Jinshanwan, Songjiang County. At 8 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 16th), a bandit armed with a Mauser pistol broke into the shop and demanded 2,000 yuan in national currency from Zhang. Zhang replied that the small shop did not have such a large sum of money. The bandit then fired a shot, hitting Zhang in the right leg and exiting through the left leg. Zhang fell to the ground injured. The shop assistants, seeing the bandit fire, scattered and hid. The bandit then stole 100 yuan in national currency from the counter and drawers and fled. Afterward, Zhang was escorted to Shanghai and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment at 7 p.m. last night.

### Russian Policeman Commits Suicide: Shot in the Chest, Dies on the Spot

Ilangen Yigela, a 24-year-old Russian policeman in the French police force, joined the French police force as a Russian patrolman in April of this year. He had been fulfilling his duties for several months. However, at around 5 p.m. yesterday, while on duty at Pier No. 1 on the Bund in the French Concession, he suddenly shot himself in the chest with his own pistol. After the incident, police officers rushed to the scene and investigated. Because the injury was to a vital area, he died shortly after. A suicide note addressed to his mother was found near the policeman, containing mostly negative and world-weary sentiments. After the investigation, the detectives transported the body to the morgue to await examination by the Second Special District Court.

### Foreign Company Employee Embezzles Rice Funds and Flees: Principal Culprit at Large, Stolen Funds Recovered, Three Family Members Arrested

Gu Kenfu, a Ningbo native and employee of the Dou Pai Shengchang Foreign Company at No. 387 Beijing Road, recently sold white rice worth over 9,000 yuan from the company and fled with the money. The company reported this to the General Police Station. Under the investigation of Chinese detective Wu Yaozu, they rushed to Gu's home at No. 24, Daxilu Road on the 16th, but Gu was not found. Gu's mother, Gu Zai, Gu's wife, Gu Wu, and her 13-year-old nephew, Liu Mingquan, were temporarily detained. Later, at the home of Gu Zai at No. 16, Lane XX, Fuxu Road, approximately 7,000 yuan in stolen funds were recovered. Yesterday morning, Gu Wang and the other three were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the three suspects had knowledge of Gu Kenfu's criminal behavior and that further investigation was needed. Therefore, he requested permission to temporarily detain them for investigation. After Judge Xiao Xieyin questioned them, he ordered them to be temporarily detained and rescheduled the interrogation.

### High-Heeled Shoes Cause Fatal Fall: Ms. Wang's Accidental Death, Autopsy Waived, Funeral Held Yesterday

Wang Yilu, a 20-year-old woman from Jiading residing at No. 6, Tingyunfang, Fulili Road, is the younger sister of Wang Yihui, the current female clerk of the Civil Local Court of the Second Special Court. Her father works in the Judicial Administration Department. Wang Yilu graduated from high school this summer and planned to enter Aurora University next semester. At around 7 p.m. on the 15th of this month, she and her two sisters, Wang Yide and Wang Yicong, went to deliver photos to a classmate's home at No. 39, Xilong, Jianye Lane, on the same road. Yilu went upstairs alone, while Yide and Yicong waited at the back entrance. After about five minutes, Yilu came downstairs to go home. While descending the stairs in high-heeled shoes, she accidentally fell and fainted due to a concussion. Her two sisters rushed to help her up, but she could not speak. They immediately called an ambulance and sent her to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road, but she died before receiving treatment. As usual, the hospital reported the death to the French police, and the family took the body to the funeral home for preparation. However, after the police dispatched detectives to investigate according to regulations, they prepared an official document and reported it to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court yesterday to request an autopsy. The deceased's sister, Wang Yihui, requested the Prosecutor's Office to waive the autopsy. Prosecutor Wang Ren approved the waiver on the autopsy form, stating that the case had been investigated by the Police Department and the family had stated that the death was due to an accidental fall. The autopsy was waived, and Wang Yihui was allowed to collect the body for burial.

### Female Student Attempts Suicide After Failing Exam

Chen Yuemei, a 17-year-old woman from Guangdong, is a student at a certain girls' middle school and lives at No. 17, Avenue Paul Flat in the French Concession. Chen Yuemei usually does not study diligently. Previously, she failed an exam and was held back a grade. A few days ago, her father received a report from the school stating that the student's summer exam performance was poor and she was being held back. After reading the report, he scolded Yuemei slightly. Afterward, Yuemei was unhappy. Suddenly, at around 2 p.m. yesterday, she secretly swallowed a large bottle of medicine in an attempt to commit suicide. Later, her family discovered it and quickly hired a car to send her to the hospital for treatment. She was severely poisoned and her life is in danger.

### Crane Detachment Kills One

A certain Yongyu Shipping Company ship on the Beijing-Tongzhou route was docked in Pujing Port, Tongzhou the day before yesterday. At around 2 p.m., as they were preparing to return to Shanghai, a huge iron anchor was being lifted by machinery. Unexpectedly, the iron teeth on the machinery broke, and the crane suddenly collapsed. Four people were crushed to death on the spot. Pu was injured in a vital area and died immediately. Lu Rongxiang, 37 years old, and Zeng Pugen, 37 years old, and Wang Honggen, 24 years old, all had their right hands crushed, and blood flowed freely. The three injured were brought to Shanghai by the ship last night and transported to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

### Taoist Priest Turns Bandit: Robs Fortune-Telling Shop, Sentenced

Wang Xingbao, a local man residing at No. 147, Li Mei Road in the French Concession and previously a Taoist priest, gathered Qiu Sanzi from Jiangbei and a person nicknamed "Rotten Wood" (still at large) on the 22nd of last month. They carried pistols and sharp blades to the home of Wang Wenlong, the blind owner of a fortune-telling shop at No. 46, Li Mei Road, and committed robbery. At the time, they stole nine pieces of clothing. Not satisfied, the Taoist Wang sent a threatening letter on the 24th of the same month, extorting 500 yuan and specifying that he would meet on Gansu Road in the Public Concession the next morning at 7 a.m. After receiving the letter, Wang reported it to the Songshan Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the address and apprehended the two men, Wang and Qiu, on the spot. They were taken to the police station and transferred to the court. The trial has concluded, and yesterday Wang Xingbao and Qiu Sanzi were each sentenced to four years and six months of imprisonment.

### Huitong Bank Closes: Limited Deposits and Loans, Minimal Losses to Outside Parties

The Huitong Bank at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road in this city was founded by Fan Liang. It engaged in the business of buying and selling drafts, British and American gold pounds, gold certificates, securities, and deposits and loans. Fan served as the manager himself. Unexpectedly, Fan suddenly died of illness on the 5th of this month. Because no one was in charge, the bank announced the suspension of business on the day of Fan's death (the 6th). The bank has now appointed accountant Jiang Wanping to formally announce the closure and liquidate the accounts. Jiang issued a public notice stating, "According to Fan Chen Xiu Yun, the legal heir and spouse of the late Mr. Fan Shaoliang, and his son, Changhua, Mr. Fan passed away due to illness on July 5th. As a result, the Huitong Bank he operated cannot continue to operate. Therefore, we have specially commissioned your accounting firm to represent us in announcing the closure and liquidating the accounts in order to conclude the business. We hereby legally entrust and represent to notify all creditors to bring their debt certificates to our office for registration within two weeks. Failure to do so will be considered a waiver of the claim. All debtors are also requested to submit the principal and interest owed to this accounting firm within the same period to complete the formalities. This is hereby announced." It is reported that the bank's business focused on the buying and selling of securities and foreign currencies. Because its credit was not reliable, there were limited deposits and loans, so there were minimal losses to outside parties.

Li Afu, a 41-year-old native of Tongzhou, worked as a rickshaw puller at the Ningbo Tangzi (lodging house) run by Mrs. Ye Dong (55), a Ningbo native, at No. 10, Fubaoli, Liuma Road. At 3:45 p.m. on the 15th, Mrs. Ye was riding in the rickshaw pulled by Li when he suddenly collapsed due to a stroke in front of the Dahou Hotel on Dongxin Bridge, Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, while heading west. Mrs. Ye also fell out of the rickshaw. When she got up and looked, Li was already dead. A police officer arrived and reported it to the police station. The police dispatched detectives to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue, notifying the deceased's younger brother, Li Linbao. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court examined the body and confirmed that the death was due to illness. The deceased's younger brother signed a statement to claim the body for burial. However, because the family was poor and unable to afford it, the employer provided funds to purchase clothing and a coffin for burial and transport back to their hometown.

### Melon Vendor Beaten, Intestines Ruptured for Cutting into Watermelon, Seller Forces Sale Leading to Conflict, Perpetrator Tang Wenjun Detained for Investigation

Wang Liansheng, a 35-year-old man from Anhui, resides at No. 13, Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, and works as a fruit vendor. At 1 p.m. on the 16th, Wang went to the Gongtai Freight Company at No. 12, New Market Road, Fujian Road, to purchase watermelons. While Wang was selecting watermelons, he accidentally poked a hole in one with his finger. Tang Wenjun, a Shanghai native and employee of the freight company, questioned Wang, saying that since he had poked a hole in the watermelon, he had to buy the whole load. Wang argued that if the watermelon was not rotten, it would not have been pierced so easily and that he could not be forced to buy a rotten watermelon. As a result, the two sides argued and then fought. Wang was severely beaten by Tang and others. After returning home, he suffered severe abdominal pain. His family reported it to the Laochan Police Station, and Chinese detective Qiu Sijiu rushed to the scene, arrested Tang, and sent Wang Liansheng to Renji Hospital. Doctors found that Wang's intestines were ruptured and immediately performed surgery to sew them back together. If the fever does not increase again, his life may be saved, but there is fear that he may not survive. Yesterday morning, Tang was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the circumstances, stating that it was not yet known what damage had been done to Wang Liansheng's life and requesting an adjournment of the case. After Judge Xiao Xieyin questioned him, he ordered Tang to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing.

### Misuse of Reuters Name: "New Shen Bao" Corrected

Reuters, 17th Local News: Reuters and the Shanghai Japanese organ New Shen Bao, previously had a dispute because the newspaper published a news item, falsely claiming that it was issued by Reuters, has been resolved. The New Shen Bao has now published a correction, stating that the news was not from Reuters. It is reported that the Japanese Consul-General warned the New Shen Bao not to misuse the Reuters name after communicating with the British Consul-General. The original text of the correction published by the New Shen Bao is as follows: "Correction: The news item 'Ambassador Cole Arrives in Chongqing' published on the front page of this newspaper on April 22nd, which stated 'According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 19th,' was an error. We hereby correct it." This news item, which appeared in the New Shen Bao on April 22nd, falsely claimed to be a Reuters Chongqing dispatch and stated that internal conflicts within the Nationalist government were now deepening and that the British Ambassador's visit to Chongqing in April was based on the instructions of the British government to kindly warn the Nationalist government to begin peace negotiations with Japan.

### This Morning Gunfire West of Shanghai: Sounds Like Rifle Fire, Reason Unknown

Around 1:20 AM this morning, at a bridge approach on the Western Outer Ring Road of Shanghai, approximately five or six gunshots were exchanged, sounding like mutual fire. Upon careful listening, the gunshots seemed to resemble those of rifles. Whether it was a shootout between police and bandits, or gunfire from one side only, and whether there were any casualties on either side, is unknown because it was late at night and the area is on an extraterritorial road, making investigation impossible. More details will be provided later. The location is about two hundred yards from the concession.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Hong Xiaogang, who claims that upon reading a news item in your newspaper, the facts presented therein were not entirely accurate. Upon investigation, I found that my client had rented his surplus rooms to Shao Yizhou for residential purposes. However, Shao Yizhou later established a "classroom" (課壇) there and frequently burned paper money and beat large gongs late at night. My client, considering this to be disturbing the peace and security of the other residents, advised him against it, which led to resentment. Around 2:00 PM on June 30th, when my client's wife requested the rent, Shao Yizhou not only refused to pay but also assaulted her. Although my client's sister reported the incident to the police, he decided to settle it amicably and did not pursue the matter further. As for the supposed further conflict at 8:00 PM, this is entirely fabricated by Shao Yizhou as a false accusation. My client has already filed a countersuit against Shao Yizhou, accusing him of false accusations. Fearing that the public might be misled, I have been instructed to request a correction. Therefore, I am writing this letter to request that the original letter be published in your "Letter to the Editor" column.

Respectfully submitted,

### Strange is the so-called "Theory of Chinese Medical Art" (Part 2)

— Song Daren

Mr. Zhang himself admits that he is "an amateur." Naturally, he lacks a deep understanding of the structure of Chinese and Western medicine. Yet, he insists on participating in this specialized academic discussion. Even if scientific medicine has its imperfections, he cannot grasp the crux of the matter. He spouts off a lengthy and irrelevant discourse that leaves the reader utterly confused. Using such an article to cast doubt on science and promote a new theory is simply overestimating oneself!

Did Mr. Zhang not say that the few words in Mr. Ding's speech, "If teachers cannot fully teach, students must use their superior talents and abilities to comprehend on their own," are insufficient to form the basis for the argument that Chinese medicine is an art? Indeed, quite right! He also said that Mr. Ding's speech only cited many mystical and superstitious clichés found in ancient medical books, such as yin-yang, the five elements, the five directions, the five colors, the five flavors, and the six energies, etc. But what about his own arguments? Haha; he has fallen into the trap of metaphysics! Mr. Zhang knows that yin-yang and the five elements are unreliable, yet the texts he quotes all originate from yin-yang and the five elements. He even claims that his arguments are ten thousand times more profound than the magic of yin-yang and the five elements. He then goes on to talk nonsense about the six fu organs, the six officials, the six energies, the six excesses, the six meridians, and the six methods. I do not know how this differs from what Mr. Ding cited in his speech? In my opinion, Mr. Zhang cites even more of these clichés than Mr. Ding. Mr. Ding emphasizes talent and experience, which indeed demonstrates a lack of understanding. However, Mr. Zhang goes even further, recklessly discussing philosophy! Isn't this a joke? Moreover, the final section of Mr. Ding's original article still advocates for the scientific reorganization of Chinese medicine's experience. Mr. Zhang, however, is different. Although he also mentions "reorganization is essential," he does not mention the word "science" at all. It seems that Mr. Zhang is somewhat unwilling to approach the "theory of science"—one might even say he detests it. He only finds it interesting to see "absolute scientists" hesitating and faltering!

Frankly speaking, the theory of Chinese medical art is fundamentally untenable. The content of so-called "Chinese medicine" is extremely chaotic, containing elements that coincide with science, as well as elements that are extremely mystical, illusory, absurd, and inconsistent with facts. It is simply a monstrosity. If you wish to create a new theory, you must at least be able to represent the entire academic theory of Chinese medicine, include everything without omission, and be able to reconcile the thoughts and techniques of various doctors throughout each era without forced interpretations. Only then can it be established. This may leave a little wonder in medical history—but only in history, with no benefit to the future of Chinese medicine.

Medicine is absolutely an experimental science and cannot be compared to music, dance, calligraphy, and painting, which are arts. The object of medicine is "people," while art has "objects" as its focus. People are organic and living, while objects are inorganic and lifeless, thus they are different. We see that the application of art can sometimes be increased or decreased at will. A little more can be added here, and a little less can be subtracted there; it is not fixed. If the creation is good, it is said that he has talent; if the creation is not good, it is said that he has no talent. Medicine is not like that. It requires science for diagnosis and science for treatment. Everything must be based on scientific principles. If one relies on personal artistic methods to determine the treatment plan, then it is like what Ban Gu said: "Turning cure into aggravation, turning life into death!" Let me give an example to prove the difference between medicine and art: In the Qing dynasty, there was a famous painter named Luo Liangfeng. He had great talent for painting. Once, he gave Yuan Zicai—a great poet of the Qing dynasty who lived at the same time as Luo—a portrait. Yuan Zicai wrote a letter to him saying, "I don't know whether it's the old man who handles the cooking in the kitchen or the old man who sells porridge in front of the door." He disliked that he was not drawn like himself and returned it to him. However, Luo Yu Feng's artistic talent and value were not cancelled because of this, and no one would recognize the real Yuan Zicai as not Yuan Zicai based on this portrait, but as another villager or old man—it still had no impact on Yuan Zicai and would not cause him to lose his true face. Medicine is related to human life. If it is the same patient, you diagnose that he is talking about phlegm, and another Chinese medicine practitioner says that he has wind. If the pathologies are different, people will feel strange and doubt your great art. If the medicine is used improperly, the treatment is wrong, and the patient is harmed, then the doctor's reputation will be ruined? The so-called artistic application of Chinese medicine, even if it is really under the fingers of contemporary medical practitioners as Mr. Zhang says—but it may not be the case—at most it is just the skill of "people," not the value of "learning." It is clearly about Chinese medicine, but what is being said is about people. (Chinese medicine) "divine skill lies in the person," "whatever to do, one can be handy". Then we see Hua Tuo, Bian Que, in the ancient books - regardless of whether they actually existed, their skills were so magical, but after they died, they became a swan song, and no successors can inherit their unique knowledge. Is this the so-called value of art? What does it have to do with Chinese medicine? Moreover, the application of art is precisely about "cutting, patching, and supplementing." Whether it is broad technology or narrow art, there is this tendency. However, art also has its actual things as its objects, but due to the different talents of each individual, there are differences in height and inferiority. Therefore, wind, dampness, liver yang, and yin deficiency can vary from person to person and be said randomly, and those who cannot find the real object should not be called art. If you insist on giving it the crown of art, it is nothing more than the "Jianghu art" of Chinese medicine! What is the value?

Common Knowledge of Diseases

### Main Symptoms when Diagnosing Intestinal Diseases

— Cheng Hanzhang

When there is a disease in the intestine, there are several main symptoms in diagnosis, namely (1) pain, (2) bloating, (3) bowel movement, and (4) tenesmus (urge to defecate, straining, feeling of incomplete evacuation) etc. These will be described separately below:

First, pain: The intestine fills a large part of the abdominal cavity, and there are many organs nearby, so when complaining of abdominal pain, it is first necessary to determine whether it is caused by intestinal disease or originates from other organs. For example, kidney stones, bladder stones, gallstone pain, acute pancreatitis, female ovarian and uterine diseases, etc., all have symptoms of abdominal pain and must be differentiated. If the pain is already known to be caused by other diseases, more attention should be paid to whether it is localized in one part or is widespread. However, when patients experience severe abdominal pain, even if it originates in one part, they often complain of pain throughout the entire abdomen, so this point is very difficult to distinguish. It depends entirely on the doctor's rich experience to make a determination.

In the case of localized pain, it is necessary to pay attention to its anatomical location. For example, pain in a small area around the navel mostly comes from the small intestine. In the case of ileitis, appendicitis, pericecal inflammation, etc., the pain occurs in the right lower abdomen. In the case of duodenal ulcers, the pain is directly below the gallbladder. In the case of acute inflammation of the sigmoid colon, severe pain occurs in the left lower abdomen. However, it must also be noted that the location of abdominal pain sometimes does not coincide with the affected area. For example, in the case of appendicitis, the initial pain is often not in the right lower abdomen but is reported as stomach pain or navel pain, or even left abdominal pain. At this time, if you are not careful to palpate the entire abdomen, it is easy to overlook and make a mistake.

Secondly, it is also necessary to pay attention to whether the abdominal pain is continuous or intermittent. Pain caused by the nature of the organ is continuous. Pain that is nervous or caused by spasms in part of the intestinal tract is temporary and intermittent.

Again, it is important to examine the relationship between eating and bowel movements. In the case of duodenal ulcers, the pain is usually more severe three or four hours after eating, especially when eating solid foods. Pain in the large intestine is often related to bowel movements. Continuous or temporary pain occurs before bowel movements. The pain disappears completely after defecation. In other cases, it is necessary to distinguish whether the nature of the pain is acute or chronic, as well as its relationship to exercise, manual pressure, etc. For example, if the abdominal pain is more severe when releasing pressure than when pressing down, it is probably a sign of peritonitis; if the pain is relieved when pressing down, it is a nervous condition.

Second, bloating: Bloating is a symptom of intestinal disease caused by the accumulation of gas in the intestine. Physiologically, gas is sometimes produced in the intestine due to the type of food, and there may be a lot of it, but mild bloating is caused by weakened ability of the intestinal wall blood vessels to absorb gas due to congestion of the portal vein and circulatory disorders. It is also seen in intestinal serositis or peritoneal tuberculosis or cirrhosis of the liver. High levels of bloating are mostly caused by intestinal obstruction, narrowing, or intestinal paralysis. Acute high bloating is usually caused by constipation or is seen in cases of intestinal intussusception. Chronic high bloating, in addition to the above situation turning into a chronic condition, occurs in cases of chronic enteritis, fermentative intestine, indigestion, intestinal neurosis, cicatricial intestinal stenosis, or intestinal spasms.

Third, bowel movement:

A. Constipation: Can be caused by lifestyle, the type of food, or medications. Acute constipation caused by intestinal disease may indicate intestinal obstruction or narrowing. In addition, acute constipation may occur in the course of chronic gastric catarrh, gastric dilatation, peritonitis, and meningitis. Chronic constipation is seen in chronic organic diseases, such as gastric obstruction, habitual constipation, and chronic compression of the intestine by nearby organs.

B. Diarrhea: First, pay attention to whether it is acute or chronic, the causes, and whether it is accompanied by abdominal pain. Diarrhea is often caused by food or drug poisoning, so it is even more important to investigate the previous lifestyle. When infectious diarrhea is prevalent, pay attention to whether there has been any exposure to infection. In diarrhea caused by stomach disease and indigestion, pay attention to whether there were stomach disorders before the onset of the disease.

Chronic diarrhea includes nervous diarrhea, catarrhal diarrhea, chronic peritonitis, intestinal tuberculosis, liver cirrhosis, and other diarrheas. Therefore, pay attention to the other symptoms of these diseases.

Fourth, tenesmus: Tenesmus is mostly seen in dysentery, proctitis, rectal ulcers, perianal inflammation, prostatitis, or hemorrhoids. In women, it may also come from diseases of the uterus or the area surrounding the uterus. In children, it is also seen in intestinal intussusception. In short, the symptom of tenesmus occurs when there is a disease in the deep part of the large intestine or its vicinity.

### Observations on the Treatment of Pneumonia (Continued from Issue 23)

— Gu Buwen

After undergoing serum treatment

Mortality rate reduced by fifty percent

Now, in 1,200 cases of infectious Type 1 pneumonia, the mortality rate in those treated with this serum therapy is 15%, while in those treated with non-serum methods, the mortality rate is 25%. Therefore, the number of deaths can be reduced by 40%. In 700 cases of infectious Type 2 pneumonia, the number of deaths can be reduced to 37% or 30%, which can reduce the mortality rate by 19%. Since the introduction of this serum therapy, the mortality rate in various cases has been reduced by almost 50%.

At the same time, another method of treating pneumonia using comprehensive preparations has also been successfully tested. This is a chemical compound called S.U. 36, which is beneficial for various febrile infectious diseases of the respiratory system. This agent should be administered intramuscularly and has good results for the symptoms of influenza and bronchitis, and is especially effective for bronchopneumonia. In lobar pneumonia, fever can also be relieved and reduced, or often restored naturally. The effect of this agent is to enhance the body's resistance.

There is an even more advanced treatment for pneumonia using chemical therapy. A drug called Sulfanilamide (i.e., Prontosil) has now been discovered, which has an excellent effect on streptococcal infections. Initially, it was not very effective for pneumonia, but after thorough research, it was discovered that it contained a substance called 2-Sulphanily 1-Aminopyridine, also known as Mand B 693 (i.e., Dagenan). It was then discovered that its effect was not only effective against streptococci, but also had the same effect on meningococci and pneumococci. Evans and Gaisford used it to treat pneumonia and achieved fully satisfactory results because their body temperature dropped rapidly and the patient's symptoms also showed significant improvement.

However, the use of this drug should be fully considered with caution, because although it contains fewer toxins than sulfanilamide, it has various special reactions, such as feeling unwell, headache, nausea, anemia, etc. Therefore, the quantitative management of the patient's diet must be strictly controlled. Furthermore, foods or laxatives containing sulfur must be avoided as much as possible. The obvious effect of this agent is to eliminate the capsule of pneumococcus, which is achieved by the smooth flow of white blood cells, and then the task of destroying the capsule can be achieved.

After using Mand B693, there is no need to do the usual chest poultices or take stimulants.

Unless breathing is severely difficult, it is rare to use oxygen. It is only used occasionally to do everything possible until the final breath or when it is recognized that it is impossible to save the patient.

If oxygen is used at the beginning of the disease, it has a definite value because it can relieve heart fatigue and greatly facilitate breathing. Therefore, early use of oxygen can often prevent the aggravation of lung congestion. This symptom of lung congestion often causes complications of lobar pneumonia, which is very dangerous and cannot be denied. Therefore, early use of oxygen in clinical practice can increase the chances of recovery and is not insignificant.

### Overview of National University Curriculum (Part 2): Curriculum Ignores Domestic Materials and Actual Life; Natural Sciences and Social Sciences are Not Interconnected

(2) Inconsistency in required and elective subjects: The same subject is listed as required in some schools and as elective in others. For example, in the Department of Biology of the eighteen universities, thirteen schools list General Botany as required, one school lists it as elective, and four schools do not offer this course. In the Department of Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry is listed as required in eighteen of the twenty-five schools, as elective in three schools, and four schools do not offer this course. In the Department of Physics, eighteen of the twenty universities list College Physics as required, two schools list it as elective. Ordinary Physics is listed as required in eighteen of the twenty universities, and two schools do not offer this course. Equation theory is listed as required by ten schools in the Department of Mathematics, as elective by five schools, and five schools do not offer this course. For all these listed subjects, whether they are important or unimportant in each department, whether they should be taken or not, the schools' evaluations differ so much.

(3) The amount of curriculum varies from school to school: The number of class hours for each subject is also very inconsistent. The Calculus of the Department of Mathematics of each school is a full-year course, but the class time is set at four hours per week, three hours per week, and five hours per week. In the Department of Physics, Modern Physics is set at three hours of lectures and three hours of practice per week to be completed in one year, three hours of lectures per week to be completed in one and a half years, one hour of lectures per week to be completed in two years, and three hours of lectures per week to be completed in half a year. In the Department of Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis has the least amount of class time, with two hours of lectures and nine hours of practice per week, to be completed in half a year, and the most is two hours of lectures and twelve hours of practice per week, to be completed in one year. There is no fixed standard for the amount of teaching for each subject in each school, and the situation is like this.

(4) The grade level at which subjects are set differs:

The year in which the same subject is set in each school is not always the same. Some are set for first-year students, some are set for second-year students, and even in School A it is required for first-year students, while School B lists it as required for third-year or fourth-year students. For example, in the Department of Chinese Literature, Introduction to Literature is listed as required in nine of the twenty schools, five schools arrange it in the first year, three schools arrange it in the second year, and one school arranges it in the fourth year. In the Department of Law, History of Chinese Legal System is listed as required in six of the seventeen schools, one school arranges it in the first year, one school arranges it in the third year, and four schools arrange it in the fourth year. In the Department of Philosophy, Ethics is listed as required in seven schools, two schools arrange it in the first year, one school arranges it in the second year, two schools arrange it in the third year, one school arranges it in the third or fourth year, and one school does not specify the grade level. This is not only the case in the liberal arts departments, but also in the departments of the science faculty. In the Department of Botany, Plant Morphology is required in twelve of the twenty schools, two schools arrange it in the first year, seven schools in the second year, two schools in the third year, and one school in the second or third year. In the Department of Mathematics, Advanced Calculus is required in seventeen of the twenty schools, twelve schools arrange it in the second year, four schools in the third year, and one school in the fourth year. The depth and disorder of the curriculum setting in each school is like this.

(5) The names of the subjects are different:

Between schools, the names of subjects with similar natures are called one name in School A and another name in School B. For example, Equation Theory in the Department of Mathematics is called Elementary Equation, Modern Geometry, or Modern Pure Geometry. Physical Chemistry and Theoretical Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry, Military Chemistry and National Defense Chemistry, Teaching Method and General Teaching Method in the Department of Education, Methodology of History and Historical Research Method in the Department of History, Comparative Government and European Continental Government in the Department of Political Science, etc.

(6) Repetition of subjects in the same school

In the same department of a school, there are subjects that are repeated, only the names are slightly different. For example, in the Department of Chemistry, Organic Chemistry has already been set up, and at the same time, Introduction to Organic Chemistry and Organic Chemistry Theory are set up. In the Department of Physics, Ordinary Physics has already been set up, and the Outline of Physics and the Overview of Physics are set up again. In the Department of Mathematics, Modern Algebra has already been set up, and the General Theory of Modern Algebra is set up again. There are also repeated subjects in the same school due to different departments. The Department of Law sets up Administrative Law, which is taught by one professor, while the Department of Political Science sets up General Theory of Administration, which is taught by another professor. The Department of Chinese Literature sets up Laozi and Zhuangzi, which is taught by one professor, while the Department of Philosophy sets up Laozi and Zhuangzi Philosophy, which is taught by another professor. Repetition and complexity are inevitable in most schools.

(7) Emphasis on specialized subjects while neglecting basic courses

The general phenomenon is that they all like to set up courses that are quite specialized. The Department of Political Science simultaneously requires Comparative Civil Service System and Anglo-American Administrative System. The Department of Sociology simultaneously requires Chinese Social Organization and Chinese Social Problems. The Department of Economics requires the theory of the business cycle and Marxist economic theory. The Department of Chinese Literature sets up Western Sinology Phonology and Research on Oracle Bone Inscriptions and Bronze Inscriptions. The courses of the University Graduate School are often set within the four-year curriculum of the University.

The above seven points are the phenomena obtained by comparing the curriculum settings of various universities and departments. If we further discuss the content of the curriculum, the neglect of domestic materials, the isolation from actual life, and the lack of connection between natural sciences and social sciences, and the lack of a consistent trend in the opening of courses in various schools, are also general phenomena of the university curriculum.

### Jiangsu Yangzhou High School to Move to Shanghai, Students Form School Protection Association, Requesting the Department of Education to Prevent the Move

(Taixian Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School in Taixian County has been very successful since its establishment because it meets the needs of out-of-school youth in northern Jiangsu. The Jiangsu Department of Education recently ordered the school to move to Shanghai for the next semester. Most of the students at the school have a deep belief in the school and are unwilling to transfer to other schools, and they face many difficulties in continuing their studies. Yesterday, more than 300 students in the school gathered to discuss the matter. As a result, they formed a school protection association and requested the department to prevent the move. They have now sent telegrams to the Jiangsu Department of Education and various parties to appeal.

### Three Middle Schools Approved by the Ministry of Education to Enroll Impoverished Students

Since the establishment of Xiaoguang, Zhaoguang, and Yude Middle Schools in this city, which are specially approved by the Ministry of Education, they have attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. Moreover, due to their low tuition fees, young students are flocking to them. It is said that the nature of these schools and their purpose of running schools is to help out-of-school students and impoverished children. Therefore, tuition fees must be reduced as much as possible. The students they enroll are limited to out-of-school and impoverished children. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that students who are already studying at other schools will not apply for the entrance exams. If students are found to be not impoverished among those admitted in the future, they may be advised to transfer to other schools.

### A Brief Discussion on Old Celebrities

— Shangqing

I don't believe the ancient saying that "drinking heavily and reading *Li Sao* is enough to be called a celebrity." Because that's too simple. There are of course various reasons why a celebrity is a celebrity.

Celebrities accumulate virtue, are capable in writing, and value integrity. Naturally, they have many things that make people admire them. However, the habits of celebrities, such as getting drunk and acting impulsively, being unkempt, and neglecting their families' livelihoods, do indeed make people frown and dare not approach them.

By "old celebrities," I mean those who are old and purely old-fashioned. However, I don't want to evaluate the value of old celebrities or whether they are needed today. I just want to say a few words about the old celebrities I have heard about and seen, hoping that in this rapidly progressing modern era, especially in the process of the whole country resisting the war, they will not fall too far behind and be unable to contribute.

I believe that what makes old celebrities fall too far behind the times is their superstition. Praying for dreams, consulting mediums, and fortune-telling are their superstitious behaviors, and immortals, Buddhas, ghosts, and gods are the objects of their superstition. They have forgotten Confucius's words, "Not yet understanding life, how can you understand death?" "Not yet able to serve people, how can you serve ghosts?" "Respect ghosts and gods, but keep them at a distance." and "Worship the gods as if they were present." According to modern scientific explanations, dreams and consulting mediums are all self-deceptive subconscious actions, and immortals, Buddhas, ghosts, and gods are at most fabrications created by religious figures to save the world and people's hearts, tools to scare women, children, and ignorant people. They are unwilling to explore science even slightly, but instead blindly deceive themselves, believing that dreams have evidence, mediums are accurate, and ghosts and gods are spiritual. They not only deceive themselves but also talk about it with relish, proclaiming it verbally and writing it down, boasting of unexpected encounters and unique secrets. They don't think about how much they themselves are harmed, let alone how much harm they cause to others. Can the handling of world affairs and the progress of world civilization be entrusted to dreams, consulting mediums, and seeking help from ghosts and gods?

They have missed the opportunity for self-development and hindered the progress of the world. They should not do this.

What makes them backward, just like superstition, is their feudal thinking. They only believe in the ways of the ancient kings and do not understand that Confucius was a reformer who used the past to change the present. They do not approve of new political systems, let alone think about modern political trends and social ideals. They try their best to preserve patriarchal society and maintain outdated morals such as women must remain chaste while men can take concubines and visit prostitutes. In other words, they want to restore everything, especially in literature. They only think that classical Chinese is good, especially ancient-style poetry and prose in classical Chinese. Therefore, they try their best to imitate it and urge others to imitate it as well, not knowing that imitation will never succeed and that there is absolutely no need for this imitation in the current era. I say this not like them, who know nothing about new literature and dismiss it as boring, or who know nothing about old literature and dismiss it as useless. Although I am not a top scholar, I have also been involved in this area and know a thing or two. I believe that restoration is undesirable, and promoting ancient-style poetry and prose is especially undesirable. There are many reasons, but in a nutshell, they have missed the opportunity for self-development and hindered the progress of the world.

They may boast of knowing astronomy above—perhaps the astronomy of astrology—and of knowing geography below—perhaps the geography of feng shui—but as the ancients criticized certain celebrities, they absolutely know nothing about human affairs! Their superstition and restoration are a result of not knowing human affairs, in other words, not knowing the affairs of the world! How can one not know human affairs for the sake of people! How can one not know the affairs of the present world when living in the present world! They should not fall too far behind!

Because they have fallen so far behind, they have nothing to contribute to the current war of resistance. Of course, their integrity can be used at this moment. Their unwavering integrity in the face of great adversity, never shamelessly serving the enemy, is enough to inspire the weak and corrupt. However, this is passive and lacks active action, which is still of no help. Moreover, people like Huang Qiuyue were also celebrities of their time. Therefore, passive integrity without active action inevitably has many crises surrounding it.

At this critical juncture of life and death, if they want to preserve the value of their true celebrity status, they should break their superstition, abandon their restorationist thinking, and contribute to this great era in their own positions! As for how to contribute, I think they will have a way as long as they are determined, and there is no need for me to say anything more.

### Running

— Chen Yongcai

A stuffy day: no sun, no wind, no rain.

Lao Yan sighed.

"Lao Xin! Where shall we eat lunch?"

"Damn it, if I have money, I'll eat wherever I want. If I don't have money, what's there to talk about!"

"How about eating at my house?"

"Only a bastard would go to your house! Your mother's face..."

Lao Xin was just such a straightforward fellow. I said:

"Hey, you're my friend. Just let my mother be! If she's got a long face, just pretend you don't see it." I looked at him. "We have to eat, after all!...Come on, let's go together."

I went to pull him, but he suddenly broke free and ran to the other side of the road.

In the evening, it cooled down, and there was a bit of wind.

Lao Xin was whistling at the back door. My mother said:

"Your beggar friend is calling you to go beg for food together!"

I muttered, "What's wrong with having a beggar friend?" and glared at her.

Pale yellow lamplight spilled on his face: Lao Xin looked even thinner.

We walked out of the alleyway.

"Lao Xin! What did you eat at noon?"

"Two sesame cakes, totaling two cents."

There was a black thing stuck to his collar. I thought it was a bedbug.

"Where did that bedbug on your collar come from? Are there a lot of bedbugs in the hostel?"

He put the black thing in his mouth, smiled a little, ha, it turned out to be a sesame seed.

The street was still quiet. The trees swayed, their leaves rustling. Shadows flickered. What was most annoying was the grit, which flew into my face and made it itch uncomfortably.

The distant streetlights looked like stars in the sky.

"Where are we going?"

Lao Xin didn't answer, his eyes fixed on the ground. He started singing softly:

Wandering, escaping;

Escaping, wandering!

When will the wandering end?

Where will the escape lead?

A car sped past, the fumes and dust suffocating me.

Lao Xin suddenly leaned against the wall and stopped walking. He was panting.

"Damn it, I can't walk anymore!...My eyes are blurry..."

I helped him up, and he glanced at me.

"What's wrong? Lao Xin! Didn't you eat enough at noon?"

He bit his lip and started walking again.

"I don't have any money, of course I didn't eat enough! Can you lend me five cents tonight? Five cents will pay for tonight's hostel, and tomorrow I'll have to eat something. I'm leaving tomorrow afternoon! Just think:

Our country is in turmoil!

We have nowhere to wander,

Nowhere to escape!

How about it? Can you lend me five cents?"

I fished a few small bills out of my pocket and gave them to him. He put them in his pocket:

"Is that five cents?"

"I don't know!"

Lao Xin muttered.

"Where are you going tomorrow?" I suddenly remembered to ask him. "Where's the travel money coming from?"

"I'll figure it out tomorrow. If I don't have any money, I'll sell something and borrow a little more."

After a while:

"Can you lend me some more? I'm really sorry..."

"Sure! Come tomorrow! But... at most, I can find a way to get five yuan." "I'll be able to figure something out when I get to Wenzhou!..."

The next day, he didn't come in the morning, and I didn't see him in the afternoon either. I thought he wouldn't come.

It was getting dark. It started to rain intermittently, the wind gusting stronger and stronger, the lamplight shrinking blurrily into a ball.

...Mumbling... *Woosh—woosh!*

My mother wasn't home. I stuck my head out the window and, sure enough, it was Lao Xin.

I handed Lao Xin the five-yuan bill, and he suddenly became embarrassed.

"I always feel really bad..."

"Don't say too much. Why didn't you come during the day? I waited for you all day."

"Damn it, it took me all day to sell my stuff. Luckily, the ship doesn't leave until tonight!"

The raindrops were getting bigger. Lao Xin's hair was wet and stuck together. He squeezed some water out of it with his fingers and flicked it away casually.

"Write when you get there!" I couldn't think of anything to say. "Hey, is that enough money?"

"Maybe I'll write! I have enough money!"

He was about to leave. I grabbed an umbrella for him because it was raining harder.

He nodded, opened the umbrella, and walked toward the alleyway.

Suddenly, he turned back, the rain pattering on the umbrella. He lowered the umbrella:

"Here, take it back!"

"What? It's raining so hard, and you're still..."

He put the umbrella down.

"Damn it, that thing's annoying to carry. I'm not afraid of the rain! I'm off!"

Lao Xin limped and staggered away.

Lao Xin's figure disappeared into the rain.

### On the Road to Danyang (Part 2)

— Le Huan

——A Wartime Journal from the Shanghai-Nanjing Line

We each arranged our bowls and chopsticks and scooped food from the pot. The old woman stood to the side, looking at us with pity, as if we were desperately hungry.

Whoever talks the most while eating loses out. Everyone was silent, staring blankly at the old woman.

After helping the old woman with her chores, it was already around three o'clock. We quickly bid farewell to the old woman. In the end, I told her an extraordinary piece of news. The secretary secretly gave a child a dollar, and we hurriedly left the small village.

Bending over, hunching our heads, like boatmen pulling a rope on the riverbank. Thinking of the taste of sweet potatoes, I wonder when we will be able to taste them again? (Donating proceeds from a charity sale)

### Red Devil Vasika

— By Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou

The girls crowded at the door as if glued together. Silently listening to Asnia's murmurs and Vasika's moans.

Lida stood in front of the crowd, quickly flicking the red hair stuck to her fingers.

"What if he dies?" someone said softly, and then immediately fell silent...

The girls tried their best not to make any noise and carefully left Vasika's room. After they left, various broken things and tattered pieces of cloth were scattered on the floor.

Asnia was left alone in the house.

She sighed deeply, walked to Vasika's side, and asked softly;

"Hey, do you need anything?"

He opened his swollen eyes and stared at her, not answering anything.

"Hey, say something... Do you want water?... Yes, I can get you anything... Ah... You must want some water? Then I'll go get it..."

Vasika only shook his head silently, moved his lips, but still didn't say a word.

"Oh dear, why—won't you say anything!" Asnia smoothed the curls on her neck and said, "Are we making you suffer?... Does it hurt, Vasika? Huh? Endure it, endure it, it will be healed soon, it's just a little painful at first,... I know that!"

Vasika's head moved, and he said in a hoarse voice:

"Please... give me some water..."

The insatiable greed in his eyes was gone.

Except for eating, drinking tea, and bringing things to the patient downstairs, Asnia stayed in Vasika's room upstairs. The sisters didn't talk to her or ask her anything. The madam didn't interfere with her taking care of the patient, nor did she call her to receive guests. Asnia often sat by the window in Vasika's room, watching the snow-covered roofs, the frost-whitened branches, and the plumes of smoke rising like white clouds. When she was tired of watching, she leaned on the table there and dozed off. At night, she lay down on the floor near Vasika's bed and spent the night. (10)

### Shanghai Establishes Temperance Society

A temperance society has been established in Shanghai, opposite the chapel behind the Shanghai Municipal Council in the British Concession. The original intention of its establishment was for the sake of sailors on steamships. Because after they come ashore, many go to bars to drink heavily, and when drunk, they often cause trouble. With the establishment of the society, this problem can be avoided. The rooms inside the society are clean, the equipment is beautiful, and there are books and new newspapers for entertainment. There is either one meeting per week, or two meetings per week. On meeting days, exquisite dishes and delicacies, exotic fruits, and famous cakes are prepared for a small banquet, for conversation, but without alcohol. The hall has already been opened last Saturday, with more than two hundred sailors and Western gentlemen from Shanghai gathering. Admiral Tie of the navy also came to inspect after the meal, showing a strong sense of Yu Liang in the Southern Pavilion, with no small amount of excitement. He is an upright and forthright man, and the sailors show him great respect and love. The admiral also praised the society greatly for its good system.

### Westerners Race Sampans in Suzhou Creek

This afternoon, Westerners raced small boats in Suzhou Creek at the New Bund Bridge. For a time, Chinese and Western gentlemen and ladies lined the riverbank to enjoy the view, their heels touching each other, leaving almost no space. Before the race, a flag was erected on an earthen mound three or four miles away from the mooring place. A Westerner on it was using a telescope to look from a high place. From there, the sampans all untied their ropes and moved forward, each boat carrying a small flag, turquoise, green, and red as markers. The first race consisted of two boats, each driven by six people. The boatmen on the boats were all wearing narrow-sleeved short shirts, and as soon as they left the shore, they quickly rowed with double oars, as fast as arrows. In no time, they had reached the bottom of the earthen mound. The Westerners on the mound, seeing that the boat with the green flag had arrived first, fired a foreign gun to show their praise. The boat was two or three zhang long, narrow at the front and back but wider in the middle. Afterwards, several more races were held, and it was not until about five o'clock that the performances ended.

### Shanghai War Zone Infant Asylum

— (Xishan)

Before the war, Shanghai had several infant asylums, taking in those abandoned infants. However, with the outbreak of the Shanghai war, these infant asylums, either due to financial reasons or because they were located in the war zone, closed down one after another. However, the abandonment of newborn infants has increased, and most of them come from the war zone. In this situation, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association established a Shanghai War Zone Infant Asylum to rescue helpless infants born in the war zone. The asylum has been established for two years now and was originally located in a church on Beichang Road. It has now been moved to 116 Dunxin Road on the Great Western Road. Yesterday, the reporter accompanied Mr. Chen Zhengfan of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association to visit. Now, I will give a brief introduction to the work and implementation of the asylum:

The asylum is located on the Great Western Road, so the surrounding environment is quite quiet. Entering the gate, there is a Western-style large residence with a garden in front of the house. The air is very good, and this environment is indeed very suitable for children. The current person in charge of the asylum is Mrs. M.J. Helmick. The Children's Welfare Association provides the asylum with a monthly funding of one thousand yuan. The insufficient portion is donated by Mrs. Helmick to her friends. The method is that the donor designates to adopt an infant, taking on the adoption fee of fourteen yuan per month. Therefore, on the cribs of the children, there is often a sign hanging, with the name of the adopter written on it. This indicates that the infant has been adopted by someone. Dr. Cheng Kangyou is in charge of the health work of the infants in the asylum. Daily life is managed by nurses and assistants. The head nurse is Ms. He Xiulian, and there are several teachers to teach the older children.

In the 27th year, the asylum admitted a total of 225 infants. After placing 60 and 79 deaths, there are currently 86 remaining. These 86 infants are divided into five groups according to their age: newborn to five months; five months to ten months; ten months to one year; one year to two years; and two years and older. Each group is managed by different nurses. The asylum has three floors. The downstairs, except for a part used as a laundry room, is all used for recreation. The second floor is the infants' bedroom. The bedding is all small white-painted iron beds and rattan cradles. The layout of each room is extremely clean, and the spacing between each bed is quite wide. There is sufficient light and air. The third floor is the bedroom for older infants. At the same time, a classroom is opened outside the bedroom, with desks, blackboards, and toys, which are used to enlighten children's knowledge. Ms. Bao Shufang and Chen Sufang are responsible for this part of the work.

The daily life routine of the infants in the asylum is that they get up at 6:00 AM. After getting up, they conduct a cleaning inspection and test their body temperature. Breakfast is at 7:30 AM. Bathing at 8:00 AM. Another feeding at 10:00 AM. Naps from 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM. Feeding at 3:00 PM. Feeding at 6:00 PM. Going to sleep at 7:00 PM. Among them, older children have separate scheduled literacy time and recreation time. In terms of food, each infant is also different according to their age. Infants from newborn to five months are completely fed with milk powder; those from five months to ten months are fed with milk powder and wheat paste; those from ten months to one year eat wheat paste and bean cakes; those from one year to two years and two years and older are given rice and bean cakes. In terms of clothing, most of it is made by themselves, and some is donated by other places.

This is a very peculiar phenomenon. The number of girls in the asylum is more than twice that of boys. There are only twenty or so male infants at present, and the remaining sixty or so are all girls. From this point, it can be clearly shown that the social atmosphere of valuing men and devaluing women is still very strong. At present, the asylum not only takes in helpless infants from the war zone, but also takes in other abandoned infants at its discretion. At the same time, if someone wants to adopt an infant from the asylum, they are also very welcome. Anyone who wants to adopt can first contact the asylum and select an infant. After the selection, the asylum will issue a request form and fill out a statement form from the adopter, which will be directly sent to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association. After the association investigates and qualifies, they can adopt. However, after adoption, the association may investigate the living conditions of the infant after being adopted at any time. If an unsuitable living environment is found, the association has the right to take the adopted infant back. At the same time, the asylum also has several regulations for adopters: The adopter must have a proper occupation, with a monthly income of more than fifty yuan, and have the ability to adopt. The adopter must have a reliable guarantor, and it should be stated at the time of adoption that the adopter will teach the adopted child and give them inheritance rights. But in fact, although there are a number of requests for adoption at the asylum every day, very few are able to qualify.

Since its establishment after the war, the asylum has been managed by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, Mrs. Helmick, and various staff members. Most of the planned work has been implemented, and active improvements have been made in the health, care, and intellectual development of infants, so the achievements are very satisfactory. However, it is still hoped that people from all walks of life can provide sympathetic cooperation.

### Unemployed Attention! Another Scam to Collect Application Fees

— Fuyun

Why is a 50 yuan deposit required for a tea server? How can an indefinite number of trainees be accommodated?

Editor:

The trick of recruiting employees to defraud money has long been exposed, but unexpectedly there are still people performing it there, and some people are still being fooled. Although a half-dollar application fee is not a large amount, it is limited to one person, but hundreds of people can make it considerable! This cunning trick of deceiving the unemployed out of their money is like sucking the blood from the unemployed, it's really hateful! I am sharing the facts in this publication to prevent the unemployed from being fooled. The facts are as follows:

The day before yesterday, in the recruitment column of the ×× newspaper, there was an advertisement for recruiting trainees and tea servers, stating that the trainees' monthly salary was six yuan, and the tea servers' monthly salary was eight yuan, without specifying age or qualifications. Generally, the unemployed who are wandering around all day, seeing that there are no qualifications or age limits, and no harsh conditions, think that it is a good opportunity not to be missed, so they bring the newspaper to ××× Fuzhou Road to try their luck. Just after ten o'clock, a hundred people were already squeezed into this room. Inside, on the wall, there was a temporary sign written on a piece of paper: "×× Enterprise Society." There was a large desk, three people in suits and leather shoes, two around thirty years old, and one just over twenty, who were the temporary examiners; two sitting at the two ends of the desk, and one standing in front of the desk. One by one, the unemployed went to them for individual interviews. The general idea was that now the company's business is developed, and after posting the advertisement in the newspaper, many people have come to apply and been accepted. There are only two vacancies for tea servers, and a deposit of 50 yuan must be paid first. The trainees are hired and sent to work elsewhere (not in other places, but because the company's business is developing, and the room where the interview is being held is no longer sufficient, elsewhere refers to the location to be expanded). There is no fixed number of trainees, and an application fee of 50 cents must be paid first. After review, a letter will be sent to reply whether or not they are accepted, and the application fee will not be refunded. Most of the unemployed cannot afford the tea server's deposit, but quite a few people pay the 50-cent application fee for trainees, leaving their addresses and waiting for good news at home.——This 50-cent application fee, whether or not they are accepted, will not be refunded, and there are no age or qualification limits, so many people fall for it. It is said that the business is developed, but there is not even an enamel sign, isn't it the same old trick?

### Biographies of Female Ballad Singers

— Shen You

If "Ai Qing" is "　Qing", then it can be verified that she was a native of Wu, and was sisters with Huang Xiuqing and Huang Yunqing. She was skilled in ballad singing and had a reputation for beauty. As for Wu Suqing, Wang Tao's "Ying 　Magazine" has already mentioned her, and "Hai Zou Ye You Supplement" has also touched on her. The "Supplement" says:

A man washing his ears by the Wusong River collected twenty-eight ballad-singing women in Shanghai and commented on them. For a time, it spread throughout the brothels, and those who copied the words of Yang Bote were almost as expensive as paper. It was unexpected that the world has changed, and small changes have occurred, and the romantic events have been scattered, and personnel have changed. People like Yuan Yunxian, Wu Suqing, Jiang Yueqing, Zhu Youxiang, and Xu Yayan are married. Chen Aiqing has gone elsewhere. Qian Yaqing has passed away. Qian Liqing, Tang Yunqing, Yu Cuie, and Wu Liqin are nowhere to be found. It is truly sad to feel the passage of time and the differences between the past and the present. Those who have succeeded them include Zhu Liqing, whose beauty and talent are unparalleled, like a crown in Changtai. Others such as Wang Qinxian, Jin Yuzhen, Chen Zhaoyun, and Zhang Cuixia are all charming and pitiful, enough to rival their predecessors, and are indeed outstanding among the later generations. Shanghai has many talented people, which is enough to add color to this profession.

I don't know if the "appraisal" of the ear-washing man mentioned in the article is the "Book Immortal Flower List". At the same time, the Foolish Taoist also has "Twenty-Four Women's Flower Appreciation Pictures with Titles from Red Snow Lyrics", which compares Suqing to a "narcissus", calling her a "talented woman", and commenting: "The bright moon in Xiangjiang has given up her jade pendant, and the clear breeze in Luoshui has come to play with pearls." Her personality can be seen, but unfortunately, her skills are not mentioned. Chiping Sou's "Brief History of Welcoming Female Ballad Singers" has mentioned her book-singing life, but it does not belong to the area of excellence. Chiping Sou said:

In Shanghai customs, female ballad singers are called "teachers", the singing place is called "book field", and the performance of each skill is called "meeting book". All members are not allowed to sit in the field until they are old. However, there are four people who do not attend the meeting book: Wu Suqing, Chen Daixiang, Wang Lijuan, and Chen Zhixiang. These four people are indeed outside the dust.

It can be seen that she is not an ordinary ballad-singing woman. In addition to the above-mentioned female ballad singers, Chiping Sou also mentioned Wang Xiuqing and Hu Guifang, calling them "Yuan Yunxian's disciples". He also made comments on the following people:

Tang Yunqing, with a true and straightforward personality, was originally named Xue Baoqin, and was in the same profession as Xue Baochan. A secretary of Hangzhou redeemed her, and later a magistrate from Anhui changed her current name. Baochan is quite sincere. Zhu Jingxiang has not been seen, but it is said that she can have a clear conversation. Youxiang is her disciple. Zhu Pinlan and Zhu Sulan are two sisters. Pinlan is slightly naive, and Sulan is more articulate. Pinlan fell in love with someone and wanted to marry him, but her parents locked her in a room and sold her shortly afterwards. When Sulan performed her skills, her appearance was too solemn, and some said that this was a chastity arch on her forehead. Zhu Suqing is her sister. Hu Liqing is good at flattering people and is jokingly called a vixen, because these three characters are similar to her name. She has recently redeemed herself and belongs to the Qian family. Yaqing is her sister. Chen Aiqing is inferior to Liqing, Zhang Fengjuan has been married for a long time, her appearance is average, but she is very deep in love. Yu Cuie is quite quiet. Others such as Shi Yuelan, who is Yuan Yunxian's sister. Chen Yuezhen, who is Chen Yuee's sister. Jiang Yuejuan, Jiang Yueqing, who are Jiang Yuee's sisters. Zhang Xiujuan, who is Zhang Fengjuan's sister. Hu Lanfang, who is Hu Lanfang's sister. As well as Wang Yueqin, Wu Liqin, Zhang Yunqing and other ladies, are all outstanding in later generations, and I have not seen most of the rest. (9)

### Cameraman's Good Fortune

— Qihua

“Anything For A Thrill”

Hollywood film companies do not perfunctorily produce newsreels because they are appendages of feature films; in order to quickly convey situations from all over the world, from politics to folk customs, as well as many accidental events, to the audience, they are not only carefully designed, but also highly competitive. For example, recently, the beauty of the British Emperor and Empress, Shanghai's cinemas (first-run) are all showing newsreels from various companies; not long after the American submarine accident, we also saw the rescue newsreels on the screen.

Since the production of newsreels is valued by the authorities of various companies, the staff responsible for the production naturally have to go through strict screening. They must at least have a healthy physique, be agile in their movements, and also have the most important condition: alertness. When the "August 13th" war broke out, many people thought of going to the front to shoot war films, but the result was that there were no achievements. Naturally, the lack of material conditions was one reason, and the lack of such talents was also an undeniable fact.

Because I watched "Cameraman's Good Fortune," I said a lot of nonsense.

The story of "Cameraman's Good Fortune" is very poor, but it writes about Tang McLore's (Flan Ruda) alertness and bravery, which is what every news photographer should learn.

The handling of the whole film is not too dull. The few scenes of Tang McLore secretly filming Betty and stealing the newsreel, and the villains robbing the film during the screening, are quite tense and cater to the tastes of the petty bourgeoisie.

Random Notes on Artists

### Opera School and Cheng Melody (Part 1)

— Recorded by Leng Fang

… … Spoken by Ms. Hou Yulan, “Female Yanqiu” … …

Introduction by Jiping: Hou Yulan, nicknamed "Female Yanqiu," is both skilled in singing and acting, and is excellent in both appearance and talent. She is an outstanding talent among the rising female Dan actors in the capital. She is here to perform with the famous bearded actor Yan Jupeng, and her new voice is being tried for the first time. As soon as she sings, she becomes popular; her reputation is well-deserved and not accidental. She specializes in Qingyi, Hua Shan plays, and newly arranged plays, with more than a hundred plays in total; she is dignified and solemn, simple and unadorned, like a maiden from an old family, and has absolutely no air of an actress; this year she is only nineteen years old, and her future achievements are unlimited, she is a very commendable excellent female artist.

This is my first time coming to the South, and I am still young and have too little experience. I don't know much about drama, so I only know to perform seriously on stage and practice seriously off stage. I can say that I have no opinions on drama.

I am a student of the "Chinese Opera School" in Peiping. I entered the school at the age of fourteen and graduated last December at the age of eighteen. The term of study at the opera school is usually seven years, but because I had some foundation before entering the school, I was considered a transfer student, and I graduated after only five years.

Since coming to Shanghai a few days ago, many gentlemen who care about the drama business have asked me about the internal situation of the opera school. I am very happy, and I am very willing to talk about learning opera in our opera school in detail.

Our opera school is located in Muchang Hutong outside Chongmen; it is a very large hall with a total of more than one hundred rooms. The current principal, Mr. Jin Huilu, is a scholar. There are nearly thirty teachers who teach opera singing and acting for each level of Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Chou, most of them are famous old actors in their fifties and sixties; there are also six or seven teachers who teach Chinese, English, math, and other general courses. The rules for learning opera are roughly the same as in the opera troupe; however, the opera school organization is purely school-based and regulated, such as training, management, accommodation, and other aspects, everything is orderly and very serious. It allows students to focus on training in basic knowledge outside of learning opera, so that everyone has a sound personality.

The scheduled class time every day is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM to teach opera; from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM to practice martial arts, waist and legs, somersaults, and weapon techniques.——Those who study literary plays only need to learn weapon techniques and leg kicks. From 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM in the evening, Chinese, English, math, and other general courses are taught. There are more than one hundred male and female students in the whole school; the teaching method is to divide Qingyi, Hua Dan, Sheng, Wu Sheng... etc. into separate classes, set up separate classrooms, and teach at the same time; singing and dialogue focus on oral teaching, and opera books are only for reference; when students violate regulations, the teachers only limit them to facing the wall as a punishment, and do not often punish them severely like in the opera troupe.

The rules of the opera school are very strict in all aspects: the age of admission is stipulated to be above nine years old and below thirteen years old, and those with an elementary school diploma are qualified.——However, those who have a very high level of opera, can also be admitted as transfer students from the age of fourteen to eighteen. Before admission, those who pass the examination must prepare three kinds of documents: a contract, a voluntary application, and a guarantee, stating the length of study, that they must not drop out halfway, and that they must fulfill their obligations to perform opera before and after graduation, and abide by these rules absolutely. After admission, students live on campus all year round and have no freedom to go out of the school; even if there are important matters that require them to go home, the parents or guarantor should fill out a certificate at the school according to the rules, which will only be valid after being approved by the school. Because, in addition to providing their own clothes and shoes, the school not only does not charge tuition fees, but also provides all food, accommodation, and book fees; therefore, the school rules are very strict and should be absolutely obeyed.

### Hou Yulan

### Ah Q and Mrs. Zhang

— Xi Tong

I watched the pre-performance of Ah Q Zhengzhuan (The True Story of Ah Q), adapted and directed by Xu Xingzhi, by the Sino-French Theater Society at the Lafayette Garden on the 14th evening. Sometimes Ah Q or the local tyrant would enter the stage from the aisle between the audience seats, which was quite novel and interesting; it has been almost thirty years since I last saw this kind of performance. Only when I was about ten years old did I see the Xia brothers and Mao Yunke's "New Camellia" at the Nine Mu Di Stage, where in the end the city wall was burned, and a team of soldiers crossed from under the stage to the stage.

After reading Xu Xingzhi's confession in the special issue of the play, I know that the author has been brewing this play for ten years, which shows how much effort he has put into it. I heard that he had extensively visited enthusiasts of popular literature just to determine what tune should be used for the song sung by Wu Ma at the beginning of the second act. From this rigorous spirit, he can be compared to the French naturalists who personally visited patients with snake bites.

In order to make the structure of the script tighter, and also to exaggerate the hypocrisy and crimes of the local tyrants and evil gentry, the author made Zhao Taiye commit adultery with Wu Ma, and also let the Fake Foreign Devil hook up with the young nun, and finally put their own crimes on Ah Q. Although this plot is not in Lu Xun's original work, this treatment is clever and more dramatic. However, since it is for a tighter structure, why put Kong Yiji from "Kong Yiji" and the story of Xiao Xi from "Medicine" in as well? I think these two segments, which are irrelevant to the theme and are not in The True Story of Ah Q, can be deleted; not only can the structure be tighter as a result, but it can also save time and reduce audience fatigue.

In terms of actors, Wang Xianzai's local tyrant and Xu Xinyuan's Zhao Taiye are veteran craftsmen in the film industry and are rich in experience, so they are extraordinary. Wang Zhuyou's Ah Q and Lu Ji's Wu Ma also performed extremely well, and almost all the others, such as Hua Rong, Yang Fan, Lu Shan, Zhou Qi, Hong Dou, Li Qing, and Lai Jinming, were excellent. However, the young nun should also wear a hat, just like the old nun. The singing lines of the dragon and tiger fight seem disharmonious when using the Shaoxing tune, it is better to use the current Beijing flavor, because the dialogue is also in Mandarin.

On the 15th evening, I watched the Midnight Theater Society perform "Mrs. Zhang's Dream," adapted and directed by Wu Xiaobang. The actors Ruan Min and Fei Falcon are the children of a famous writer; I can't help but feel the swift passage of time, and now it is the time for "Little Heroes of the Tang Dynasty" to be born. This play is purely a fable, and the appearances of Mu Zi's Heath and Xian's Souslin are very similar. Mu Jinsheng should wear a military uniform with a black cloak; now he is wearing a wide-sleeved black long gown, which is easy to be confused with Ala Gong, thus increasing the comedic effect, which is not necessarily a bad thing. When it came to epigrams, the audience applauded repeatedly, which shows that this play is very meaningful.

Ah Q is a representative of the weaknesses of the Chinese national character, he is non-resistant; while Qiang Sheng in "Mrs. Zhang's Dream" is a symbol of the new China, refusing to yield and determined to resist to the end.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The long head covering used by female roles was created by Mei Qiaoling

Qiaoling was chubby, so she was called Fatty Qiaoling at the time. In her later years, she had already retired from the opera stage and rarely performed, but driven by her charitable heart, she would see her poor colleagues without clothes or food at the end of each year, and felt that the situation was really miserable. Therefore, she would often take the initiative to organize one or two "wowo tou" opera performances (poor families in Peiping all eat "wowo tou" made of corn flour, because it is cheap). She would invite other famous actors to participate, and the ticket proceeds would be used entirely to help poor colleagues. In addition, she would not refuse any requests for helping friends with stage performances or for charitable performances for local public welfare. Therefore, there were indeed many people who praised her at the time. But the difficulty was that as she grew older, the wrinkles and forehead lines on her face increased day by day, and became longer and deeper. An old man with a face full of chicken skin singing a "hua dan" role (Qiaoling was famous for playing "hua dan") was somewhat different from a pure singing "qing yi" role, and he himself felt too embarrassed when he dressed up. Therefore, he invented an artificial remedy. Whenever he dressed up for a performance, he would use a long, five- or six-foot black gauze head covering. When he was doing his makeup in front of the mirror, he would instruct the hairdresser to pull the head covering tight. While he used both hands to push and rub the wrinkles and forehead lines upward, the hairdresser standing behind him would unfold the head covering and lift it up once, and then use the gauze head covering to tightly wrap it around once, repeating this several times until all the wrinkles on his face were gone. Imagine that at his age, he was willing to endure such pain to plead for the poor; this kind of merit is really not small. Amateur performers who don't perform often sometimes faint on stage from wearing a water gauze head covering, let alone an elderly person who is so tightly wrapped. How could they not feel dizzy and have a headache? ——(61)——

### "Wang Baochuan" is Finalized: The Lead Female Role Still Belongs to Zhang Cuihong

— Yinyi

Xue Pinggui is Remodeled as a Hero of Resistance Against Japan

Yi Hua Film Company is actively producing the costume film "Wang Baochuan." The scenes of Xue Pinggui and Princess Daizhan are almost coming to an end. Xue Pinggui is played by Li Ying, and the role of Princess Daizhan once caused a competition between Zaiyang and Gu Han. In the end, it was changed to be played by Diao Banhua. Diao Banhua took a lot of "military uniform and sword" photos, and her heroic spirit is no less than that of Chen Yunshang in "Mulan Joins the Army."

The female lead Wang Baochuan was originally intended by Yi Hua from the beginning to be the "classical beauty" Zhang Cuihong. Later, because Zhang Cuihong's "husband" did not want his wife to appear on the screen again and expressed a "firm refusal" to Yi Hua, Yi Hua had to think of other ways. Yan Youxiang, the young owner of Yi Hua, personally went to Hong Kong to prepare to invite Li Qinian, the leading actress of Nanguo, to Shanghai, but he did not succeed. After Yan Youxiang returned to Shanghai, he continued to negotiate with Zhang Cuihong. Zhang Cuihong and her "husband" felt a little embarrassed by Yi Hua's sincerity, so they accepted Yi Hua's invitation. Now, the role of Wang Baochuan has finally been decided.

On the day Shanghai was hit by the storm, the Wujiapo set at Yi Hua's studio was blown away by the wind, so filming was suspended for two days. Later, it was rebuilt, and this scene has now been completed. According to Wu Cun, Xue Pinggui on the screen will be completely transformed into a hero of resistance against Japan, which is completely different from Xue Pinggui in the stage play "Red Mane Stallion." In this way, the doubts from the outside world about "Wang Baochuan" being brought to the screen can be dispelled.

### Silver Screen Report

— (Yindi)

Li Pingqian introduced foreign stage plays to the screen. In the past, there were "Camille" and "Lady Windermere's Fan." Now, the Golden and Silver World, which is being shown at the New Guang Grand Theatre, is the third one. The next film after this one has been decided, named "Sheng Si Hen" (Love Unto Death), starring Chen Yanyan and Wang Yin, and is being prepared for filming.

Little Fatty Guan Hongda performed at the Dahua Ballroom on the 16th, and many dancers paid attention to him.

The virgin work of He Zhong Film Company, the costume film "Wen Sucheng," has been filmed to about 30-40%. Among them, the role of Liu Xuangu is still looking for a successor because Jin Suwen resigned due to illness. Someone introduced Ms. Gu Han (who has performed in dramas at the Red Star Theatre) to the He Zhong authorities, but it was not successful because the director Zhu Changlin disagreed. Now, the He Zhong authorities still intend to negotiate with Jin Suwen, asking the second Miss Jin to reluctantly take on the role.
