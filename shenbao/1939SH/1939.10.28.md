### China's Determination to Resist Japan Grows Stronger Recently; British Ambassador's Meeting with Chiang Has Nothing to Do with Mediation; American Ambassador Unwilling to Talk About False Peace

Chongqing: Regarding the peace rumors, it is learned from responsible sources that China has decided to continue the war of resistance until the final victory is achieved. This determination has grown stronger recently, as successive victories have been reported on various fronts, and support from friendly nations has also become increasingly active. The remarks made recently by US Secretary of State Hull and US Ambassador to Japan Grew have aroused admiration throughout China. Political figures believe that China will never negotiate peace with Japan unless Japan withdraws its troops stationed in China, and China will never accept mediation unless a third country guarantees the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Therefore, the general public does not believe that the recent talks between British Ambassador Kerr and Chairman Chiang have anything to do with mediation and peace. In addition, it is said that US Ambassador Johnson, since returning to his post several months ago, has been stationed in Chongqing. He once said that he hoped to see China continue the war of resistance until victory is achieved, and that he was unwilling to obtain a false peace through mediation. (27th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Chongqing: A reporter from the Central News Agency, noting that the Japanese side has recently been spreading rumors in an attempt to disturb the Chinese people's hearts, and although relevant parties have repeatedly denied them, they are still circulating externally, specially visited Zhu Shiming, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for inquiries. He replied as follows: The Japanese have recently encountered unprecedented military setbacks and feel deeply unable to continue supporting themselves economically. Under these circumstances, they can only use deceptive propaganda, specializing in creating rumors, attempting to alleviate the grievances of their people at home on the one hand, and to cover up their predicament in the international community on the other. Their ultimate goal is to use rumors to shake China's unwavering will to resist Japan. Taking only the past month as an example, the rumors they have systematically fabricated are too numerous to count. Their rumors about Sino-Soviet and Sino-British relations have been vehemently refuted by Secretary-General Zhu of the Central Party Headquarters. Recently, they spread the rumor that the National Government entrusted US Ambassador to China Johnson to convey peace proposals to Japan on behalf of the US government, which has also been officially denied by the US authorities. We can only call this kind of trick a rumor offensive. The most clumsy ones are the rumors about the actions of our military and political leaders. In fact, these leaders are either commanding operations at the front or performing their duties as usual in Chongqing, as proven by the facts. The Japanese side even fabricated claims that Chongqing has begun informal peace talks with their representatives, which is truly absurd and ridiculous. We do not need to fear Japan's "rumor offensive" because we believe that facts will ultimately defeat rumors. The rumor offensive will fail completely, just like its military aggression. (27th Dispatch)

Chongqing: It is claimed here that although the Chinese government is currently focused on resisting Japan, it is not indifferent to the international situation. As of now, China maintains a position of absolute neutrality towards the warring countries in Europe and still hopes that Europe can turn swords into ploughshares to maintain European order and culture. At the same time, China's strength to resist Japan can also be enhanced as a result. Therefore, the Chinese authorities are now making great efforts to crack down on foreign propaganda that could undermine China's neutral position, and the Information Department has notified all newspapers that their remarks must be impartial and maintain pure neutrality.

### Japanese Prisoners in Guizhou Province Enjoy a Life of Luxury; Foreign Reporters Have Photographed Them

Guilin: Forty-eight Japanese prisoners of war are enjoying a peaceful, quiet, and fulfilling life in Guangxi Province, an anti-Japanese stronghold under the rule of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. Although Li and Bai lead troops to resist Japan's control of China with all their might, the Japanese soldiers captured in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces enjoy comfort and freedom in Guizhou Province, which reporters have not witnessed elsewhere in China. The Guangxi provincial authorities' preferential treatment of Japanese prisoners of war is reflected in the attitude of the Japanese prisoners. The attitude of the Japanese prisoners I have seen elsewhere is unpleasant, depressed, and silent, and they oppose invading the places where they live. However, the Japanese prisoners in Guizhou Province welcome talking to foreign reporters, as two of them can speak English. After their physical education time was over, when we asked to take pictures of them, four Japanese soldiers scrambled to perform wrestling matches, and two other teams played basketball. Two large courtyards are used exclusively for Japanese prisoners' gymnastics, and there is another large sports field for them to play ball games and tennis. During exercise time, there are only two Chinese guards protecting the two-acre (equivalent to thirteen mu in China) area, surrounded by high walls. The Chinese guards watching the ball games are more excited than the Japanese prisoners sitting on the grass. The Japanese prisoners are all subject to strict discipline, and they are so busy all day that they cannot get an opportunity to rebel. The Japanese prisoners read Chinese literature and anti-war propaganda compiled by the Japanese left-wing writer Watari Kaji. According to a certain Chinese, a graduate of Waseda University in Japan who is currently the director of the prisoner-of-war camp, the Chinese authorities plan to train the Japanese prisoners to write anti-war propaganda, which will be distributed to the Japanese army by guerrillas, and to train other Japanese prisoners. Although the Japanese prisoners receive roughly the same treatment, Japanese officers receive more courtesy and food than soldiers. Japanese officers and soldiers who voluntarily defect receive better treatment and greater freedom. Each Sunday, each prisoner receives a small package of cigarettes, and those who win sports games receive some sweets as a reward. A Japanese waitress captured by guerrillas in Guangdong Province, although there are forty-eight Japanese prisoners willing to fall at her pomegranate skirt, she does not want to accept them in her heart. The director of the prisoner-of-war camp claimed that she is separated from the male prisoners, but during the day she accompanies the male prisoners, and said, "If she falls in love with a certain Japanese prisoner, we will try our best to help them get together. If they want to get married, we are very willing to help." However, the hope of getting married in the prisoner-of-war camp did not arouse her interest. When the reporter spoke to the Japanese prisoners who could speak English, he felt that they were very interested in the world situation. A Japanese prisoner who used to be a wine merchant in Kobe claimed that he knew that war had broken out in Europe and asked the reporter, "Is that accurate?" After the reporter told him that it was accurate, he continued to ask "Why?" The reporter told him, "There is no time to talk about the course of the war." He then replied, "Just like Japan's war against China." It is said that the number of Japanese soldiers captured in various parts of China reaches more than one thousand. The reporter saw two hundred of them, and the life of the Japanese prisoners in Guizhou Province is the most lively and pleasant, perhaps because they enjoy Guangxi's excellent sunshine, food freedom, and no need to defend themselves against the danger of attacks from Chinese troops everywhere.

### A Japanese Troop Train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Destroyed by Bombing; Over a Hundred Officers and Soldiers Killed or Wounded

Jinhua: At 8 AM on the morning of the 24th, a certain Chinese unit buried explosives near Zhujiaqiao, between Chang'an and Xieqiao on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. A Japanese troop train happened to be traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou and detonated the explosives. One locomotive and twelve carriages were completely destroyed. Over a hundred Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. The Chinese took the opportunity to attack. The Japanese resisted stubbornly, but after being subjected to intense Chinese gunfire, they retreated. The destroyed vehicles were removed by the 25th. Because the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been constantly sabotaged and attacked by the Chinese, troop trains have been bombed twice in half a month, causing extreme panic. (27th Dispatch)

### Sichuan Provincial Government Convenes Commissioners' Meeting; Opened Yesterday

Chengdu: The Sichuan Provincial Commissioners' Meeting opened on the morning of the 27th. Present were Secretary-General of the Provincial Government He Guoguang, as well as department heads, provincial commissioners, and over twenty other people. He Guoguang chaired the meeting and delivered a speech on behalf of Chairman Chiang, who concurrently manages Sichuan politics, first stating the significance of convening the commissioners' meeting: (1) Since Chairman Chiang began concurrently managing Sichuan politics, it is necessary to convene the commissioners to clarify the meaning of the policy guidelines. (2) Because of the transition between the old and new years, it is necessary to listen to the reports of the commissioners to provide a basis for reviewing the past and planning for the future. (3) Because of the need to promote special and important policies with time constraints, it is necessary to explain their meaning and discuss effective methods to avoid delays. He then made two points of hope to the commissioners: 1. Carefully study the policy guidelines; 2. Strictly abide by the matters listed in Chairman Chiang's letter to the people of Sichuan. After He's speech, Deng Xihou delivered a speech on behalf of the party, government, and military leaders, followed by speeches from the heads of various departments. In the afternoon, reports from the commissioners were heard. The meeting will continue on the 28th and is scheduled to open on the evening of the 28th. (27th Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Problem of Poverty Relief

Speaking of the general life today, it can truly be called the extraordinary life of an extraordinary period. Since "control" has taken the reins, speculation has stirred up waves, merchants have added to the surge, the European war has lengthened the flow, and prices are like a prairie fire, with an unstoppable momentum. Changing daily, with ever-increasing prices, the longer it lasts, the more difficult the general life becomes. Not to mention poor families, who all sigh and look to the sky. Even households that could barely support themselves by working and raising livestock in normal times are also at a loss, lamenting the difficulty of living in Chang'an. Moreover, with frost about to fall, leaves thinning, the north wind rising, and severe winter approaching, those who earn their living by physical labor have no storage of grain or cloth at home, and their rooms are filled with the sounds of cold and hunger. How can they not weep facing each other in their cowsheds? As for those who have lost their jobs or been displaced due to war, wandering the streets, sheltering under eaves, enduring hunger and cold, allowing nature to dictate their survival, trembling like cattle and sheep in the hall. Looking around, the neon lights are dazzling, the licentious sounds disturb the ears, heavy furs are not warm, red stoves are still cold, gorging on delicacies and savoring fine foods, picking the best and selecting the fat. By comparison, the disparity between suffering and happiness is so great. This environment is like the mischievous tricks of a child of fortune, making humans enjoy different degrees of favor. All of this is wrong. It is probably because the policy of poverty relief has not been launched early, and the heart of compassion has been contained and not expressed.

The world is indeed not lacking those who cherish the hungry and drowning. But rescuing them after they are already hungry and drowning is not as good as planning for them before they are hungry and drowning. There are many men and women in Shanghai who are righteous, courageous, benevolent, and generous. The collection of winter clothing the year before last resulted in tens of thousands of items being collected in no time. How benevolent and brave their actions were! If one must wait for entertainment before donating, dancing before opening their purses, then compared to those who are unwilling to part with a single hair and are reluctant even when forced, it is still slightly better. Speaking of relief, a large sum of money is needed. Where will the money come from? It still relies on the support of the masses. If we can save on unnecessary consumption, waste on cigarettes, alcohol, fruits, and snacks, and use it for poverty relief and helping the masses, then the gains may not be small. Do we not see that the value of imported fruits such as tangerines and apples, as well as cigarettes, alcohol, perfumes, powders, and snow creams, in the first, second, and third quarters of this year amounted to a huge 42.84 million yuan? However, this is still calculated according to the central government's exchange rate for customs gold units. If converted according to the black market rate, it would be two or three times that value. There are countless other categories of imported consumables of this kind. China has been resisting Japan for more than two years, and its land is scarred and its cities are in ruins. Yet the people are still rushing after the desires of the mouth and belly, and the pleasures of the senses, living drunkenly and dreaming of death, without thinking of being vigilant. Is this not the greatest sorrow, the death of the heart, and beyond salvation? Fortunately, this is only the case for a small number of wealthy people who disregard the seriousness of the national crisis and continue to live their extravagant lives. There are also those who have become rich through hoarding and speculation, enjoying their ill-gotten gains without any thrift, forgetting themselves in their joy, and only seeking the pleasure of the mouth and belly. These people, living in society, are no different from parasitic worms, squandering at will, which is not to be regretted, but their individual losses are still small. However, they create a social atmosphere of luxury, increasing the burden of national expenditure, and their harm is great. If they can slightly restrain their desires, slightly reduce their extravagance, and reduce the consumption of fruits, cigarettes, alcohol, and other items by several million yuan, it would not hinder their necessary life. Furthermore, if they can take what they save and use it for social undertakings, then society will be stable. If they use it for industry and commerce, then all industries will prosper, so that everyone can enjoy their work, live in peace, and die without regret. What problem would poverty relief still be?

It is only because they cannot, and poverty relief must still wait for persuasion to be launched, fundraising to be collected, encouragement to be achieved, and pity to be aroused. And there are still those who turn a deaf ear and look away. Benevolence is inherent in everyone, and even a sense of compassion is something that everyone has. Compassion is the great sympathy of mankind. Jesus preached universal love, Islam emphasized almsgiving, Buddhism emphasized compassion and relief, and Confucianism emphasized universal love and kindness. Times may differ, regions may be far or near, but the principle is the same. Their commitment to saving people is also the same. If everyone takes the heart of Jesus, Islam, Buddhism, and Confucianism as their own, poverty relief will no longer be a problem. However, there are those who think that they do not need to be saved by others, and they do not show sympathy for the poor. There are also those who float and sink in the sea of desires, drowning without knowing how to save themselves, thinking that poverty has nothing to do with them. By the time they suddenly awaken, they realize that saving others and saving themselves are no different from the beginning, but it is already too late. Therefore, only those who feel the pain of cold and hunger themselves can have a spontaneous sense of sympathy for poverty relief. But often limited by their circumstances, they have more than enough heart but not enough strength, so they wear down their enthusiasm invisibly, watching their compatriots suffer in water and fire. As for the utterly poor, they cannot even take care of themselves, and feel even more helpless. From this, we can say that the implementation of poverty relief in practice is still a problem.

However, the problem of poverty relief is a major problem among social problems. Passive relief, which provides temporary comfort, is still a superficial solution. Active relief, which prevents people from suffering from poverty, is the fundamental solution. But in the current dangerous environment and difficult life, being able to do passive relief is already fortunate. In this corner of the sea, today there are countless people who do not have enough food and clothing, and who live each day like a year. There are countless more who have no clothes to cover their bodies, no food to fill their stomachs, no place to shelter from the cold, and no way to beg for food. When the north wind blows and snow falls, will we bear to watch them sleep on the side of the road and become starving corpses, or will we lend a hand so that they can barely survive, and have the possibility of resuming their normal lives or returning to their hometowns to live in peace when the war ends and prices fall? This is the responsibility of the public, and it is a duty that cannot be shirked. As the Book of Changes says, a family that accumulates good deeds will surely have abundant blessings, and a family that accumulates evil deeds will surely have abundant calamities. There are many poor people in Shanghai, but there are also many rich people. If they embrace the determination to do good and not lag behind others, and use their surplus to make up for the deficiencies of others, then poverty relief would not be difficult. As for the discussion of general living problems, that should be reserved for another discussion.

### The United States' Anti-Aggression Stance Strengthens China's Determination to Resist Japan; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Gratitude in a Broadcast to the United States; Hopes for More Effective Action Against Japan

Chongqing - Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at the invitation of the New York Herald Tribune Forum, broadcasted to the United States today. Madame Chiang expressed her regret that democratic countries did not interfere with Japan, believing that this attitude emboldened Japan to launch its conquest of China. However, Madame Chiang expressed her gratitude to the United States, as its stance had opened a ray of light for China, leading them to believe that the United States would eventually settle accounts with the aggressor, thus inspiring and encouraging their anti-Japanese spirit.

Madame Chiang said in her speech, "Eight years ago, Japan, without any reason or declaration of war, suddenly launched a large-scale invasion of our northeastern provinces, and then seized them for its own. Treaties were torn up, international law was trampled upon, and other democratic countries were threatened. However, the democratic countries turned a blind eye and did nothing. At that time, we had a firm belief in the inviolability of the League of Nations and treaties, so we remained unmoved. But our belief was shattered by reality. I believe you must feel the same way. The democratic countries' inaction in the face of China's invasion has allowed other ambitious nations around the world to seize the opportunity. The armies of these countries have taken advantage of the inaction of democratic countries to annex many free and democratic nations in various parts of the world. Not only that, but Japan, seeing this situation, its desire for conquest greatly increased, and soon its iron hooves and bombs appeared in mainland China. In the past two years and several months, Japan has spared no effort to destroy us. What we have relied on to resist the Japanese is only our own strength. Although our strength is weak compared to the Japanese, we have still inflicted blows on the Japanese. We are still fighting with the Japanese. The Western democratic countries have abandoned the treaties they themselves drafted to protect humanity and the sovereignty, independence, and integrity of China, so our trust in the West cannot but be shaken. However, our work of resistance will continue. China, which upholds the dignity of treaties, is now being abandoned by others, while the aggressor, who has openly opposed civilization and democratic countries, is still being assisted by the United States with gasoline, aircraft, and mechanized weapons to destroy the lives and homes of our people. How should we feel about this phenomenon? Only the US government has given us a ray of light and encouragement, making us know that the aggressor will eventually be held accountable by the United States. This is what we deeply appreciate about the United States. The recent US action to abolish the US-Japan commercial treaty is the initial action of the United States to condemn Japan's cunning and brutality. The Chinese people now hope that the United States' condemnation of Japan's aggression and the use of force as a national policy will not be limited to mere condemnation, and that the action will be based on Ambassador Grew's speech last week. For years, I have often said that the Japanese people who are kept in the dark should be given a frank warning. We hope that other democratic countries can be so candid. The long-suffering Chinese people now only hope that the United States can refuse to help the Japanese destroy the lives and property of the Chinese people with a solemn attitude, so as to strengthen the position of Ambassador Grew's statement. In a nutshell, the United States must not participate in Japan's actions to destroy China. It is very easy for the United States not to participate in Japan's actions to destroy China, simply by not facilitating the various materials and tools that Japan uses to conduct its cruel war against China. This is our responsibility. We feel that this request is extremely justified, because otherwise, it is tantamount to acknowledging that civilization has perished and that human desire has replaced God. If everything is based on expediency, then the door of diplomacy will not have the place of religion. Religion is the cornerstone of civilization. Without religion, there is no international justice, no righteousness, no guarantee for promises, and no belief in treaties. Treaties that are not governed by religion are in danger of being abandoned and destroyed at any time. Therefore, if human civilization does not want to perish completely, we must find a way to restore the loyalty and piety of the medieval Crusaders. We must regain the noble principles upon which democracy is based, and then human freedom and human rights will not be destroyed. In short, without religion, no country can last long. If those who conclude treaties all take religious principles as the standard, then there will be no breach of contract. Our women have a great responsibility for the restoration of peace. In this era when civilization is on the verge of collapse, it is the time for us to serve. In the history of human evolution, the amount of social contribution and the strength applied is used as a measure. Our women must not ignore this point, but must pay attention to it. There is no stagnation in the world. We must carry the cross with the spirit of the Crusaders and move forward incessantly. Unless a great change can take place in the human heart, then I dare say that the destruction of civilization must be in our generation. As for the way of its destruction, it will be no different from the cruel war that China has suffered. Only religion can save this catastrophe. In other words, both national consciousness and individual consciousness can be developed, and if we believe in religion and take religion as the rudder to govern our lives and actions, then there is hope for saving the catastrophe of civilization."

### Japan Eagerly Seeks to Adjust Relations with Britain and the United States; Negotiations to Be Held in Tokyo

Tokyo - According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun", Foreign Minister Nomura will not only hold negotiations with US Ambassador Grew in a short period of time to adjust US-Japan relations, but will also hold talks with British Ambassador Craigie to improve British-Japanese relations.

### The Three Major Principles of the United States in the Far East; McNutt Speech; Retention of the Philippines

New York - Former US High Commissioner to the Philippines and current Federal Security Administrator McNutt, at the invitation of the New York Herald Tribune Forum, delivered a radio speech tonight, stating that the United States should retain sovereignty over the Philippines and maintain the democratic foundation of the Philippine government in times of crisis. McNutt advocated that the Philippines should be granted full autonomy, while foreign affairs, tariffs, currency, and public debt should still be controlled by the United States. Regarding the issue of the US defense line in the Pacific, McNutt believed that the solution to this question depended on whether the United States would withdraw from the Far East. If the majority of Americans advocate withdrawal, then the United States should resolutely and completely withdraw. However, if the United States withdraws from the Far East, then the three major principles that the United States has always advocated will be abandoned: (1) the Open Door Policy, (2) the integrity of China's territorial rights, and (3) most importantly, freedom of the seas and freedom of the air will also be sacrificed. "However, if we do not withdraw from the Far East, then we should still remain in the Philippines, and I dare say that if we can slightly hint to the Filipinos, then the Philippines will ask us to stay in the Philippines." McNutt also said that the Far East is now in sorrow and suffering, but the Philippines is a paradise where democracy and peace can govern everything, and its democracy is advancing day by day. If the United States withdraws from the Far East, then the United States will have no say in the future of the Far East. Therefore, our task is to ensure the security and stability of the US position in the Philippines. (United Press dispatch from the 27th)

### The Information Reported by the Japanese Side Is All Groundless

Chongqing - The Japanese Domei News Agency reported that He Yaozu had flown to Moscow two weeks ago to sign a military alliance with the Soviet Union, but in fact, He is currently still in Chongqing.

As for Zhou Enlai, the liaison officer between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he is still in Yan'an and has not gone to Moscow. General Zhu De is still on the front lines in Shanxi, commanding guerrilla warfare. (Associated Press dispatch from the 27th)

### Wei Lihuang Announces Administrative Guidelines

A Certain Place in Henan - Wei Lihuang, the newly appointed Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, arrived here from Luoyang on the 25th to take office.

### The Pope Issues an Encyclical Condemning Power Politics, Advocating the Promotion of Human Conscience and Adherence to Natural International Laws

Vatican City - Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical yesterday, upholding the natural rights of human conscience and denouncing totalitarianism, stating in part, "Bringing mankind to submission cannot be achieved by swords, but only by respecting the natural rights of mankind and following the guidance of Heaven. On the contrary, taking the state as the ultimate goal and making everything subservient to it can only hinder the true and lasting prosperity of all nations. If the rulers of various countries regard themselves as the masters of the state and disregard the rights of mankind and various cultural and institutional systems, how can they speak of true and lasting prosperity? Divine right is the foundation of true right. A certain country does not recognize the existence of divine right, and places mankind outside of divine right, and replaces it with utilitarianism. This action violates all the principles of natural religion and goes against the conscience of Christianity. Nothing is more absurd than this. The freedom of conscience that mankind should enjoy is sacred and inviolable. If this kind of right is deliberately destroyed, then the mutual trust between people and even between nations will be lost, and as a result, all promises will not be trusted by the world, and the solution to all disputes will only rely on force, and will no longer be based on reason and justice. These countries have abandoned the idea that human authority is inherited from God, so the bonds of human connection and affection have been forgotten, which is very painful. As for the family, since the beginning of human history, it has fulfilled its sacred mission. Various totalitarian countries, dissatisfied with Christian thought, have destroyed the family system. How can they know that people and families existed long before the establishment of the state? If various countries want to establish harmonious and lasting relations, the main condition is that all people acknowledge and abide by natural international laws. According to this law, the independent rights of all countries, as well as their right to survive and gradually evolve through civilized means, should be respected. All existing treaties should also be faithfully fulfilled in accordance with justice and righteousness. As for the position of the Church, it has always been willing to help the world with the spirit of Christ, and has made many efforts to prevent war, but the tragedy of bloodshed has already occurred, and the Polish nation has already tasted the pain. All my Christians must pray devoutly so that mankind can be comforted." (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

Rome - The Pope issued his long-awaited encyclical today, saying that the reason why the world has fallen into today's catastrophe is due to the lack of respect for promises, the spread of militarism, and the lack of trust between nations. The Pope also criticized the autonomy of the state, saying that this is a violation of natural reason and the principles of Christian conscience. The state may demand all the property of the people, but it can never demand the souls of the people. He hopes that after the war is over, we will avoid the mistakes of the past. The new order must be based on natural law and the revelation of God. After all the convenient methods of mankind have failed miserably, the way to save the world can only be found in the White Church. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th)

### British Foreign Secretary Refutes German Foreign Minister's Attempt to Sow Discord Between Britain and France as Extremely Foolish

London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax, speaking in the House of Lords today on the international situation, mentioned the speech of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, saying that he had never seen a plot to sow discord between Britain and France that was so clumsy. The gist of the entire speech seemed to be devoted to sowing discord between Britain and France, but he did not know that the close mutual trust between Britain and France today is unprecedented. It only made people feel that Ribbentrop neither understood the British people in peacetime nor the united psychology of Britain and France. His so-called innocent Germany being threatened by Czechoslovakia and Poland one after another, and being a victim of British conspiracy, only made gods and men laugh together. The Foreign Secretary then replied to the suggestion that British-Soviet commercial relations should be restored, saying that in order to make a correct observation of the overall situation, there is something that we cannot forget. The Soviet Union's recent actions in the Baltic Sea have caused anxiety not only to those directly related to it. The situation it has created is not clear. The recent state of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is still unclear. If the negotiations are stalled, it will have repercussions in and around the Scandinavian peninsula, which cannot be foreseen now. As far as we know, there are no irreconcilable conflicts of interest between the Soviet Union and Finland. The British government hopes that the current negotiations can achieve a suitable ending. Halifax also said that although the Soviet government's declaration of economic solidarity with Germany seems to make it impossible for it to trade with the warring countries on the same terms, the Soviet Union is now willing to trade with the warring countries with an impartial attitude. The British government has already taken advantage of this attitude and concluded an agreement with it to exchange timber for rubber and tin. We are now studying the possibility of extending trade on this mutual exchange basis, in order to benefit Britain without danger. In the current environment, the barter method is the only possible basis. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)

London - Liberal Party leader Sinclair said in the House of Commons today that the Liberal Party supports the Prime Minister's attitude towards Ribbentrop's speech. The Liberal Party advocates that the British government should improve relations with the Soviet Union and not allow it to remain in its current unsatisfactory or dangerous state. Progress should be made in the commercial aspect. If the Soviet Union is forced to unite with Germany to develop its own destiny, then the Soviet Union will certainly be able to do so. The British government should take active action, starting with commerce, and then moving on to diplomacy, so that the Soviet government understands that for the sake of the Soviet Union's interests, and for the general interests of mankind, it is best to establish an understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain and France as soon as possible.

### Roosevelt's Radio Address Vigorously Avoids Being Drawn Into the Vortex, Denies Sending Children to Europe to Participate in the War, But Is Absolutely Unable to Remain Neutral in Thought

New York - President Roosevelt, at the invitation of the forum magazine here last night, delivered a radio speech, stating roughly, "Speakers can be divided into two categories." One is a faithful speaker who can use truth and reason as his destination, and the other is good at stimulating the enthusiasm and prejudices of the audience. This must be distinguished by each audience. For several weeks, American newspapers and radio stations have been reporting on international issues in an objective manner. It is also a good thing that the United States Congress is occasionally invaded by organized propaganda movements, because what is the difference between the will automatically expressed by the electorate and the propaganda movement seeking help from the masses? Members of Congress have now begun to realize this. We often hear speakers and commentators in and outside Congress making meaningless disputes, or even falsely claiming that the government is about to send troops to Europe to fight, and then expressing their opposition. This is the most hateful slander in modern history. In fact, no responsible person from the federal government, state government, or municipal government has ever advocated sending children to Europe. This kind of dishonest and shameful lie must be condemned. The position of our country in the international situation is very simple and cannot be swayed by alarming words or seeking help from prejudices. In short, our country is a neutral country and does not want to be drawn into the vortex of war. I have stated this. However, although we are conservatively neutral in action, we cannot be conservatively neutral in thought. After the people of our country have put aside their prejudices and calmly thought about the events that have occurred on other continents, they have already gained a kind of understanding of right and wrong. In addition, various news items are being objectively reported by various newspapers and radio stations, and the thoughts and judgment of the men and women citizens of our country will therefore become more and more acute, and they will be able to distinguish between truth and lies. Lies can be spread endlessly, but they will never become the truth." (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

### The King of Belgium Speaks, Determined to Maintain Neutrality

Brussels - King Leopold III, at the request of the New York Forum magazine, delivered a radio speech at 2:15 AM today, declaring Belgium's determination to maintain neutrality, saying, "Our country issued a statement in October 1937, maintaining its independent status, and it was recognized by its three major neighbors. These countries also provided solemn guarantees, willing to respect our country's territory and guarantee our country's independence. Since the outbreak of this war, our country has also declared neutrality. Our country and the Netherlands have now formed peaceful islands, which should be preserved for the benefit of all countries. Now, we pray to God not to let our country be attacked, but if other countries violate their promises, we will not hesitate to deal with them." (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

### The United States Legislates to Amend the Neutrality Act, the Senate Submits the Proposal to a Vote, Seven Proposals Are Rejected, Six

Washington - The Senate today voted on Senator Towne's proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act. Generally, this is considered the first test of strength for those who want to abolish the arms embargo. The government has now won. According to this amendment, it should be prohibited to sell arms to foreign countries in peacetime or wartime, regardless of whether they are neutral countries or warring countries, except for countries in the Western Hemisphere that are at war with non-American countries. This proposal was rejected by a vote of 55 to 27. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)

Washington - The Senate continued to discuss the Pittman Neutrality Bill today and submitted seven proposed amendments to a vote, which are listed as follows:

(1) Proposed by Republican Senator Topp, advocating prohibiting foreign ships from flying the American flag or impersonating American ships, and those who violate this will be prohibited from entering American territorial waters and ports within three months. The Senate immediately approved it by a show of hands. (2) A joint proposal by Republican Senators Tannheh and Vandenberg, advocating prohibiting the export of various poisonous gases, was immediately rejected by a vote of 54 to 36. (3) Proposed by Republican Senator Tannheh, advocating prohibiting the export of bombers, was also rejected. (4) Proposed by Republican Senator Davis, advocating that the Senate and the House of Representatives each send four members, and the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and Secretary of the Treasury, form a neutrality committee to solicit opinions before the President decides to declare that a state of war exists or no longer exists, or to take various measures permitted by the Pittman Bill. This proposal was immediately rejected by the Senate by a show of hands. (5) Proposed by Democratic Senator Towne, advocating that all kinds of armaments, whether in peacetime or wartime, should be prohibited from being transported to other countries, but this does not apply to American countries that are fighting against non-American countries for self-defense. The Senate finally rejected it by a vote of 55 to 27. (6) Proposed by Republican Senator Taft, advocating that the government should provide loan facilities for various goods transported to the warring countries. The Senate immediately rejected it by a vote of 44 to 36. (7) Proposed by Republican Senator Taft, advocating that the value of the currency of each warring country held by the US Exchange Fund should not exceed 20 million US dollars, was also rejected by the Senate by a vote of 47 to 37.

In addition, the Senate also passed a motion stipulating that the time for each senator to speak thereafter should not exceed twenty minutes (originally forty-five minutes).

### Soviet Release of Detained American Vessel - US-Soviet Negotiations Concluded - Germany Claims Contraband Transport

Moscow (Moeman'ske dispatch) - After maritime authorities here inspected the cargo of the ship "Flint City," they have ordered its release and instructed it to depart from this port immediately. (TASS, 27th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull told reporters that the US government lodged a protest with the Soviet government on the 24th of this month, requesting the return of the American cargo ship "Flint City" and its cargo to the American crew and its release. This request is based on Article 21 of the 1907 Hague Convention. Previously, in 1916, the British ship "Appam," piloted by Germans, arrived in Virginia, USA, and was later ruled by the US Supreme Court to be returned to Britain, serving as a precedent. In addition, the State Department ordered the US Embassy in the Soviet Union to send personnel to the port of Moeman'ske to investigate the situation and submit a report. At the same time, the US Embassy in Germany has also been instructed to conduct all necessary negotiations with the German government. (Havas, 26th)

Berlin - German official documents state that the detention of the "American vessel Flint City" was legitimate and legal, indicating that Germany intends to regard the ship as a prize of war. It is reported that German Foreign Minister Wetchak has informed the US Ambassador to Germany that the "Flint City" was arrested due to the loss of important certificates and charts. Wetchak also stated that a German expert in handling prize affairs has departed for Moeman'ske, where the ship is detained. The German and Soviet governments are discussing this matter because neither party is certain about the proper procedures. The "Flint City" is not imprisoned, but merely detained in Moeman'ske, it is said. (Reuters, 27th)

### German Pocket Battleship Activity in the Atlantic - British Navy Takes Various Measures - Sunken German Submarine Discovered

Paris - Well-informed sources here claim that the German pocket battleships "Scheer" and "Deutschland" appear to be active in the Atlantic Ocean. Each vessel has a displacement of 10,000 tons, equipped with six 11-inch caliber guns and eight 6-inch guns. Their range is said to be 10,000 miles. (Reuters, 27th)

London - According to various sources, the British ship "Stonegate" and the Norwegian ship "Hansen" were both sunk by the German pocket battleship "Deutschland." The American cargo ship "Flint" was also intercepted by this warship. It was rumored that the "Emden" was responsible, but well-informed sources here do not believe this. On the 8th of this month, a squadron of the British fleet attempted to attack several German warships off the coast of Norway, but failed to approach due to the darkness. The German warships took the opportunity to escape without a trace. At that time, the "Deutschland" also took the opportunity to sail along the Norwegian coast into the Atlantic Ocean. The British Admiralty is said to have taken various measures to capture the vessel when its fuel is exhausted and its return route is cut off. (Havas, 28th)

London - The Admiralty announced that a destroyed German submarine was discovered today near the Goodwin Sands off the southeast coast of England. It is reported that fifty to sixty bodies have been recovered. The Goodwin Sands in the Strait of Dover are a very dangerous area of ​​shallow shoals.

The most notable was the loss of thirteen warships in one night. (Reuters, 27th)

### Germany Claims Soviet Union Announced Support for Long-Term War - Resolved to Supply Germany with Large Quantities of Raw Materials - Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Be Affected

Berlin - Since the Soviet Union recognized the legitimacy of the Anglo-French blockade against Germany, official sources here declared today that the Soviet Union has decided to supply Germany with large quantities of raw materials to enable Germany to wage a long-term war. At the same time, Germany has decided to supply machinery to the Soviet Union in exchange, to pay for the Soviet raw materials. (AP, 27th)

London - After Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday afternoon, it was originally agreed that representatives from the British Board of Trade and the Soviet Trade Delegation in the UK would begin negotiations today. However, the representatives did not meet today. Instead, Ambassador Maisky visited Secretary of Commerce Stanley this morning for a general exchange and decided to postpone the negotiations until the day after tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, it is difficult to say whether the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations will be hampered or postponed after the Soviet Union protested the British Navy's inspection of neutral ships. This is because Ambassador Maisky was not aware that the Soviet government had lodged a protest with the British government when he spoke with Secretary Stanley. According to Soviet sources, this protest only raises a few questions of principle and will not affect trade negotiations. However, it is still unknown whether the British government also holds this view. According to the Soviet people, this protest only raises some principles and will not affect business negotiations. However, it is not yet known whether the British government also holds this view. (Havas, 26th)

London - Regarding the British inspection of neutral ships, after the Soviet government lodged a protest the other day, the British response is expected to be sent out this week. Diplomatic circles here recently commented on this matter, saying that the list of contraband goods previously promulgated by the British government is actually no different from that promulgated by the United States during the last European war. The British government enjoys this right of a belligerent state, acting in accordance with international law, with the aim of cutting off the enemy's overseas supplies. Although the Soviet government lodged a protest, the British current policy will definitely not change as a result. It can be asserted that the Soviet Union also knows that while Britain is waging a long-term war, a protest alone will hardly have any effect. Therefore, the motive for this action is probably to express the solidarity between Germany and the Soviet Union at a very low price. As for the British inspection of neutral ships, since there is ample opportunity for compensation to all neutral countries, it can be seen that the only country that has suffered losses is Germany. The Soviet government cited the 1909 international convention in its note, but in fact, no European country has ratified it. It is difficult to understand why the country cited it. From another perspective, the UK and the Soviet Union are now preparing to conduct trade negotiations based on the barter method. The exchange agreement for rubber and coal concluded by both parties a few weeks ago should be extended to other commodities, and the Soviet protest may not hinder these negotiations. Based on this, since Germany has failed to prevent the Soviet government from interacting with various countries in accordance with its neutral policy, the main intention of the Soviet government's protest yesterday was probably to comfort Germany. (Havas, 26th)

### Military Council Releases Weekly War Situation Report (Continued) October 18th to 24th

(Shanxi-Henan Front) In southeastern Shanxi, Chinese troops have been attacking Taiguan continuously, successively recovering strongholds such as Sanmatou, Wulongtou, Sigui Village, Sijia Village, Zhuangtou Village, and Maju Village. The remaining Japanese forces are trapped in the city walls and are under siege. In southern Shanxi, 5-600 Japanese troops entrenched southeast of Anze were surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army. By the 18th, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated towards Gu County, which was then recovered. Also, on the evening of the 18th, Chinese troops advanced on Yicheng in multiple directions, once reaching the southern gate and killing many Japanese troops. On the 19th, Japanese troops from Dajiao Town and Nanfan Town attacked Motou Village, but were repelled by the Chinese. In Xiaxian, 3-400 Japanese troops from Zhangliang Village and Zhangdian Town also harassed Zhangguodian, Xuecun, and other places on the 18th. After being severely attacked by the Chinese army, they immediately retreated in defeat. West of Hengling Pass, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely. Chinese troops repeatedly attacking Zhenfeng Tower once recovered Hedi on the 18th. As for the Japanese troops invading western Shanxi, they used Niuwangmiao and Yitaitou as their center and harassed the areas within Puxian and Xiangning counties since last week. After the Chinese army launched separate counterattacks, they suffered heavy losses. On the 18th, Yitaitou was recovered by the Chinese army, and Niuwangmiao and Baishan Temple were subsequently recovered. The Japanese fled in confusion. Also, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Lishi surrounded and attacked Xiaoshentou and other places in four directions last week. After the Chinese army fought bravely and fiercely, the Japanese troops retreated completely after several days of fierce fighting. In northern Shanxi, the Chinese recovered Yuanping Town, and the Japanese communication line in the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has been cut off by the Chinese. As for the Japanese troops at Changtaiguan in southern Henan, they attacked Paomaling and Zhongzipo in several directions on the 21st.

On the 18th, Kangcheng fell into Japanese hands again, but fresh Chinese troops arrived and counterattacked, and Shanggangzhen was recovered. They then besieged Yancheng, which was recovered again on the evening of the 19th, leaving Japanese corpses everywhere. 5-600 Japanese troops from Lianshui and Huaian harassed Jingkou and Cheqiao. After three days of bloody fighting, many Japanese troops were killed. In the Nanjing-Shanghai area, the Chinese army has been extremely active this week, attacking Longtan, destroying military vehicles, and fiercely attacking Xuanxing, once storming into the city walls, causing panic among the Japanese. As for the Japanese troops in western Zhejiang, they have been extremely panicked since the Chinese army stormed into Hangzhou last week. More than a thousand Japanese troops from Tianjia'an, Jiulonggang, and Chanwan in northern Anhui once attacked Jinjia Town, but were surrounded by the Chinese on all sides, suffering heavy casualties. Also, the Chinese army that recovered Dingyi tracked down and attacked the Japanese army, fiercely attacking Wuhu County, capturing many spoils. More than 1,500 Japanese infantry and cavalry troops in southern Anhui attacked Yanggongling on the 19th, but were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, suffering many casualties and deaths.

### The Chaotic Situation in Guangzhou: Japanese Troops Tolerate Bandits, Rampant Robbery, Treacherous Merchants Manipulate Currency, Paper Money Greatly Discounted

Hong Kong Correspondence: It has been a full year since Guangzhou fell. Although the population has slightly increased compared to the early days of the occupation, this has not led to Guangzhou's prosperity; instead, it has increased the chaos of public order. Half of the residents returning to the city are destitute refugees with nowhere to go, and the other half are emboldened outlaws who have surrendered to the Japanese. The refugees, quickly returning from Hong Kong, Macau, and various villages, have run out of money and have no legitimate jobs upon returning to the city. The recruited outlaws, on the other hand, are acting with borrowed power, running rampant in the city. The Japanese military believes they can use these people as henchmen, using them as spies to control bandits with bandits, and temporarily appease them to reduce the suffering from guerrilla warfare. Little did they know that letting tigers and wolves into the city would lead to more assassination and robbery cases than in quieter times. Previously, the Japanese military guarded against petty theft; now, they are suffering from blatant ambushes on the road and bombs at gatherings. In the past, Japanese sentries outside the city could venture a little over a mile; now, not only are heavy troops stationed in the suburbs, but the inspection posts that had been removed in the city have also been restored, with short trench warfare dug near the posts. Initially, the Japanese military believed that the "using Chinese to control Chinese" strategy was feasible, but now they realize they cannot control the situation. Therefore, Guangzhou's order is currently very chaotic, and most citizens who return to the city stay for only a few days before secretly fleeing again.

So far, there are no legitimate large businesses in Guangzhou's market. Except for Japanese trading companies, most are daily food stores. These food stores are mostly run by shop assistants pooling small capital, or they are shrinking in scale, transforming from shops into stalls. There is no accurate standard for prices, which depend on the state of public order. If the city is suddenly and inexplicably under martial law, and vendors cannot enter or exit the city, food prices immediately rise. Recently, the financial turmoil in the city has been a fatal blow to the market and people's lives. The main cause of the financial turmoil is the discounted paper money, and the cause of the discounted paper money is unconscious. The currency in circulation in Guangzhou is the provincial bank's small denomination notes, which have been in circulation for many years. During this period, through repeated circulation, it is difficult to preserve the paper color or paper quality without slight changes. However, the city discounts paper money, using the excuse that the paper money is old and damaged. If it is old and damaged, it will not be fully accepted, or it will be used at 60% or 50% of its value. Generally, those who hold old paper money suffer intangible losses. It is said that the discrimination against old currency is the work of treacherous merchants in general banks. These people hoard new currency in advance, and when the trend of discounting old currency sweeps the market, they can exchange the new currency, making a profit without limit through manipulation.

Since the trend of discounting paper money occurred, the first to suffer were small food shops. Because they receive old currency, they cannot discount it, but they suffer losses when settling accounts. As a result, many have closed down. The puppet organization is at a loss to deal with this, and the residents who remain in the city feel they are in dire straits.

Traffic between Guangzhou and various villages remains blocked. A few days ago, the Japanese military took advantage of ignorant shipping merchants, promising them temporary small profits to encourage ships to resume navigation on various rivers. Some small ferries from Jiangmen once returned to Guangzhou, restoring the Guangzhou-Shunde and Guangzhou-Jiangdou routes. However, shortly after the voyages, the ferries were repeatedly attacked by guerrillas. In less than a month, they were successively suspended again. Currently, except for one or two ferries operating between Guangzhou and Foshan, and Guangzhou and Panyu, the remaining routes are still cut off. As for the railways, when Guangzhou fell, most of the locomotives on the roads were destroyed by bombing. Since the Japanese army entered Guangzhou, for the convenience of Japanese military transport, they first opened the Guang-San Road (from Guangzhou to Foshan) for military use. Later, they repaired the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to run military trains from Guangzhou to Shitan. Recently, Shitan Station has been repeatedly attacked by Chinese troops, and it is said that train service has been suspended. In short, at present, Guangzhou's land and water transportation can only reach what the Japanese military calls the outer defense line; beyond this, it has been surrounded by Chinese troops.

### Chinese Troops Launch Three Fierce Attacks on Chaoan, Killing and Wounding Two to Three Hundred Japanese and Puppet Troops

Shantou Correspondence: Since the Chinese troops in Chaozhou and Shantou coordinated with the security forces and guerrillas, they have redeployed their defenses. Every day, a small number of troops are dispatched to counterattack Chaozhou City in rotation, giving the Japanese army no opportunity to rest and adjust. On the 9th and 10th of this month, Chinese troops advanced in two directions towards the Shazhou area outside the South Gate of Chaozhou City. On the evening of the 10th, they launched a surprise attack on Yunbu Market from the south, breaking into the Japanese army's camp and killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. On the 12th, the Japanese army from Shantou rushed to Chaoan to reinforce. At this time, the Japanese strongholds in various places in Fuyang had been besieged by Chinese troops and could not take care of Chaozhou City. On the 13th, the Chinese troops moved north and attacked Bijia Mountain in three directions. At 3:00 PM, they first wiped out a squad of sentries at the foot of the mountain in Tutang, and took advantage of the momentum to attack the mountainside. They held out until 10:00 PM, when Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a large-scale attack on the mountain. The Japanese army hid in earthen caves and refused to come out. The Chinese army then used dry grass soaked in kerosene, tied it to stones, and threw it into the trenches. For a time, the mountain was ablaze with fire. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Japanese army hurriedly destroyed the fortifications on the mountainside and retreated back to Chaoan City. That night, the Chinese army killed fifty or sixty Japanese soldiers. In this battle, the Chinese army charged into the city three times. The first time was by the Security Regiment's Yang Battalion, which entered through the South Gate and engaged in street fighting at the Guanyintang Street intersection. After holding out for forty-five minutes, the South Gate area, which was covered with barbed wire and electrified wires, the Yang Battalion withdrew on its own due to heavy losses. At midnight on the 13th, the Chinese daredevil team attacked the West Gate, set fire to the Japanese barracks in the jungle alley, and used hand grenades to charge for an hour before retreating. At 5:00 AM on the 14th, Chinese troops entered Dongjin Village outside the East Gate. The Japanese military headquarters of Hanshan Normal School immediately opened steel cannons and bombed indiscriminately. Counting the three charges, two to three hundred Japanese and puppet troops were killed or wounded.

### Soaring Prices in Zhenjiang, Demonstrating the Suffering of the People

Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since Zhenjiang was occupied by the Japanese army, the livelihood of the people has been extremely depressed. The prices of daily necessities have soared due to the shortage of supplies. Items such as rice, flour, oil, and salt are in short supply. Because Zhenjiang's rice and grain have always relied on Jiangbei and Wuhu, the price of rice from the end of September to the beginning of October once reached over eighteen yuan per picul. After the 10th of this month, new rice entered the market, and the supply increased frequently, so it fell to fifteen or sixteen yuan per picul. Recently, the supply has increased even more, but due to transportation issues, the selling price of high-quality indica rice is still fourteen yuan and two jiao per dan, medium quality thirteen yuan and three jiao, low quality thirteen yuan, high-quality foreign indica rice fourteen yuan, and indica rice ears are between six yuan and two jiao and three jiao. Although these prices are said to have decreased, they are still far more than the nine yuan and five jiao in October last year. Flour has the "Lujinshan" brand under the protection of the Japanese, priced at six yuan and nine jiao per bag, Hongjinshan six yuan and six jiao, and Lanjinshan five yuan and seven jiao. The prices are similar to those in Nanjing. Among the oils, except for soy sauce, which is produced by many soy sauce shops, soybean oil and sesame oil rely on external sources. The net soybean oil is priced at forty-five yuan per dan, with two jin and two liang per yuan, and sesame oil is fifty yuan per dan, with one jin and twelve liang per yuan. Soy sauce varies from twenty yuan to twenty-four yuan. Salt is controlled by the Japanese "Tongyuan Company," which sells salt based on the Huaxing puppet currency, resulting in an invisible increase of more than three yuan per dan. Currently, the legal currency is fifteen yuan, seven jiao and five fen per dan, and retail is one jiao and six fen per jin. Fuel is also expensive, which leads to a surge in firewood prices. Straw is seven jiao per dan, and pine branch firewood is one yuan to one yuan and two jiao per dan. Coal is occasionally in short supply, with Kaiping coal fines costing fifty-six yuan and five jiao per ton, Annam lump coal costing sixteen jin per yuan, and Annam coal fines costing thirty-five jin per yuan.

### Chinese Troops Approaching Wujiang, Japanese Troops Abandon Strongholds in the Suburbs of Suzhou, Handing Them Over to Puppet Troops to Defend

Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese troops occupying this county have abandoned their strongholds in the four suburbs due to their weak strength. Although there are still one or two places that have not been evacuated so far, most of the soldiers have been replaced by the puppet troops of the puppet Pacification Commander Long Guobiao. These puppet troops were formerly bandits in Taihu Lake, and their members are extremely complex. They usually specialize in robbing people of their property in the areas where they are stationed, but when they hear about Chinese troop activities, they panic. Therefore, the Chinese troops ambushing in the four suburbs take the opportunity to attack the Japanese and puppet troops, and are now advancing towards Yanmu in Wujiang, with a tendency to head straight to this county along the Sujia Railway. Therefore, the Japanese troops in this county have recently forced the farmers in Suxiang to rush to build defensive works in Sanliqiao and Yinshan in Wujiang to hold on. Educational News The Guizhou Provincial Department of Education Orders All Schools in the Province and Counties to Relocate to Rural Areas and Implement Compulsory Education (Guiyang Airmail) The province has suffered repeated air raids in recent months. All densely populated counties have been ordered by the provincial government to evacuate. In order to ensure the safety of teachers and students throughout the province, the Department of Education has ordered all public and private schools in the province and counties to relocate to more remote rural towns, such as Qingya, Huaxi, Longli, and Bijie, so that the sound of singing can continue uninterrupted. At the same time, Director Zhang also considered the backwardness of education, with illiteracy accounting for 90% of the province. In order to quickly popularize compulsory education, he specially ordered teachers and students of all schools to implement the "little teacher system" in their respective locations and earnestly implement compulsory education. It is learned that all levels of schools in the province are now complying with the order, implementing compulsory education regardless of Han or Miao people, dividing them into children's classes, adult classes, women's classes, etc. Teachers and students of all schools are willing to work hard on this task, and in their spare time, they write letters on behalf of the families of soldiers on expeditions. As for the curriculum, in addition to teaching general knowledge and air defense common sense, etc., it has only been a month since its implementation, and the effect has been quite significant. Difficult Children's Relief, Education and Training, the Root Cause of Hu Zhenjie and Improvement Measures (6) Qian Yonghe

(II) Clarify Education and Training Objectives The original purpose of difficult children's relief, education and training is to reduce national sacrifice, and the object of enemy enslavement, and to cultivate national seedlings, and cultivate a strong army to build the country. Therefore, the supreme goal of educating and training difficult children is for national liberation and national reconstruction. The most recent and practical goal is the happiness of children's future. However, there are three kinds of facts in the performance of people who are now doing difficult children's education and training. One kind has the concept of cultivating talents for the nation and the country, but lacks the talent and ability rich in educational experience, and the facility of education and training has to focus on relief and charity work. The number of children received is used to show the achievements. Improvement of quality is not easy to take care of. One kind regards the relief of difficult children as a glorious work during the War of Resistance, and also handles the difficult children's education and training business in order to increase their own honor. At the same time, they also rescued a group of unemployed teachers. The third kind of borrowed the name of difficult children's education and training to use Tongtong as a fundraising tool, and to place private individuals and develop forces. Therefore, despite the efforts of all parties to promote the difficult children's education and training business, only a few can get on the right track of education and training. We hope that comrades who are in charge of education and training work will recognize the correct goal of educating and training difficult children. The happiness of children should be the foundation, and national reconstruction and national liberation should be the ultimate goal.

(III) Increase Education and Training Funds When various difficult children's relief groups started to receive difficult children, how much education and training fees should each child need to be considered appropriate? Everyone has no experience. Based on the principle of hard work, perseverance, simplicity and frugality, the Conservation Association first set the food cost for each child at three yuan a month. Everything else comes from donations. Each teacher and staff member is paid ten yuan a month for living expenses, regardless of the complexity of the work or the length of experience. This method is originally a manifestation of the spirit of more obligations and fewer rights, but the result is that children in rural areas only eat three months and one day of food. In cities, various donations include milk, biscuits, candies, clothes, iron beds, etc. Children are the same, and the material enjoyment is very different. Because teachers and staff are volunteers, enthusiastic people come to express their desire to fulfill their obligations, resulting in more workers and fewer responsible persons. Educating and training difficult children has become a situation of forcing seedlings to grow. In addition, as living standards have increased, the standard of living expenses for children has been revised to five yuan per person per month. Teachers and staff salaries are also based on work responsibilities and experience. Recently, children's living expenses and teacher and staff salaries have been set at ten yuan per child per month. The difficult children's education and training funds of other groups mostly refer to the Conservation Association's standards and have also been increased. However, the rapid increase in prices exceeds the administrative improvement. Last September, the Relief Committee drafted a standard of ten yuan per month per child for the regular expenses of education and training institutions, which was originally an improvement standard. In fact, it is now felt that the allocation is insufficient. If there are many children, it can be adjusted. If there are few children, there is no way to contribute. Start-up costs and other special equipment are not included. Therefore, in addition to the fact that children's food and clothing can be barely maintained in each institution, if there are no donations, the educational achievements cannot be demonstrated. Production education is even more out of the question. Therefore, increasing education and training funds is also an urgent issue at present.

(IV) Adjust Education and Training Institutions Difficult children's education and training is a part of the national War of Resistance cause. Staff should understand this and work together to complete this great mission. When the Relief Committee was in Hankou, it discussed with the Conservation Association, the Relief Association, the Ciyou Association, and the Hankou Municipal Refugee Children's Education Committee the principles of dividing education and training. The Conservation Association focused on the conservation of infants and young children, the Relief Association focused on the experiment of production education, the Ciyou Association focused on the education and training of difficult children in the occupied areas, and the Hankou Municipal Refugee Children's Education Committee focused on the promotion of short-term primary schools near the refugee shelters, so that each had a central education work, and the expression of results was also easy to show. But in fact, when children in front of the front line are rescued, everyone regards them as their own flesh and blood. Unless they have to, who would be willing to send out the children they have rescued from hardship? As a result, the large-scale education and training policy is not easy to realize. In order to solve the problem, it is hoped that each group will formulate an overall education and training plan in its own conservation homes, education and training institutions, and Ciyou institutions, designating institution A to focus on infant conservation, institution B to focus on general education, institution C to focus on housekeeping education, institution D to focus on agricultural or craft education, and institution E to focus on special education. Adjust and exchange children with each other to make education and training work develop rapidly. However, the psychology of each institution and each group is just like the psychology of each group. Loving children like one's own is difficult to adjust at once. Therefore, there are children in an institution from three to fourteen years old - actually or already seventeen or eighteen years old, there are children from illiterate to junior high school level, there are children from excellent families, there are children wandering on the streets, there are older boys and girls, and there are all kinds of difficult problems in education and training. Therefore, it is hoped that difficult children's education will have long-term progress, and adjusting education and training institutions is an urgent task.

### Education Briefs

The private Beiping Minguo College, after the fall of Yueyang, moved west from Yiyang to Xupu, choosing Datan, very close to the city, as its temporary address. The school buildings and staff and student dormitories are rented from nearby civilian houses and ancestral halls, and classes have already continued.

Each People's Education Center in Zhejiang Province will establish ten mass schools, to be completed by the end of this year.

The Shanghai French Concession's supplementary school was not registered by the Municipal Council because it did not comply with the charter agreed with the Bureau.

The Difficult Children's Middle School was suspended because the school site was taken back by the owner for his own use. It is said that the school has provided funds to students with families to scatter, and students without families have been transferred by the association to the Difficult Children's Association, which will find ways to transfer them to other schools to study.

Currently, the number of difficult children receiving education in the British and French concessions in this city has decreased significantly compared to before. Statistics show that there are only over 13,000 people, a decrease of more than half compared to the 30,000 people in the autumn of last year.

The Provincial Wuxi Normal School and the Private Changzhou Middle School Joint School held a preliminary and senior Chinese speech contest yesterday. As a result, Jiang Huixian, Fu Xianyun, Bao Mingyi, and Lin Zhongguang won in the preliminary section.

Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Unequal, Exchange Rate Continues to Weaken

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, prices initially softened before firming up. Although HSBC's appetite for purchases was substantial, sellers were predominant, leading to a significant imbalance in positions. Consequently, the trend remained weak. The market opened with the British-American exchange rate further narrowing to 8.75, showing a state of a stable British pound and a tight US dollar. With Sassoon's involvement and arbitrage, the market softened again. The British pound reached a low of four pence 9.0625, and the US dollar was at eight yuan 1.5625. Later, the Japanese and American banks continuously sold, and Hong Kong Telecom frequently released funds, gradually pushing the price up to five pence per shilling, with the US dollar at eight yuan 3.125. However, due to HSBC's strong buying power, even with the Japanese and American banks and Hong Kong Telecom resuming sales, the market remained in a state of fluctuation. By the afternoon close, the British pound was at four pence 9.84375, and the US dollar was at eight yuan 3.125. The afternoon saw a slight shift, with Hong Kong banks offering substantial supply, and some foreign banks still showing interest. However, HSBC's buying appetite was not as strong as in the morning, leading to the British pound breaking through the five-pence mark again, reaching a weak price of five pence 0.3125. The US dollar also firmed up to eight yuan 3.75. At the close of the market, the British pound was still at five pence, and the US dollar was at eight yuan 3.4375, resulting in a weakening of 0.03125 compared to the previous day. Futures trading remained active, with the underlying trend similar to the spot market. Trading was brisk throughout the day.

Japanese and American Merchants Unanimously Sell

The day began with London cables showing recent gains of 5.625 and forward gains of 8.75. The New York silver price fell by 1.25 cents. London gold remained stable, and exchange rates for British currency against foreign currencies were generally flat. The US dollar fell by 8.75 against the British pound, by 0.2 yuan against Shanghai currency, and by a small amount against the French franc. Central bank listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened with actual prices for spot transactions, with the British pound at four pence 9.6875 and the US dollar at eight yuan 3.38125, representing a flat British pound and a firm US dollar of 0.03125 compared to the previous close. This was due to the decline in exchange rates. After the opening, due to Sassoon's arbitrage and weak buying interest from foreign banks, conditions tightened and softened. It was estimated that large banks such as Jiantong bought spot British pounds at four pence 9.375, and spot US dollars at eight yuan 2.21875 to 2.15625. Later, the British pound softened the most, with banks once quoting four pence 9.0625. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The announcement of the silver balancing tax revealed a large amount of 3.75 cents. Afterwards, fellow banks suddenly took the opportunity to sell, and Hong Kong Telecom cables also offered sales, immediately shifting the market to a loose and firm state. Fellow banks sold spot British pounds to foreign banks at four pence 9.6875, and spot US dollars at eight yuan 2.25 and 3.125. At the time, Hong Kong Telecom and a certain bank sold spot British pounds to HSBC at five pence, and also sold US dollars for November delivery to fellow banks at eight yuan 1.1875. Subsequently, due to HSBC's strong buying appetite, speculators slightly increased their arbitrage activities. In addition, Chinese banks bought US dollars for this month's delivery, so conditions returned to softening. Jincheng bought US dollars for this month's delivery at eight yuan 2.28125 and 2.25 from Datong and a certain bank. Later, spot prices even weakened again to four pence 9.375 and eight yuan 1.1875. At midday, Hong Kong Telecom and fellow banks resumed selling, so the process returned to firmness. By the midday close, banks' selling prices for spot transactions had firmed up to four pence 9.84375 for the British pound, and the US dollar had eased to eight yuan 3.3125, representing a softening of 0.015625 for the British pound and a strengthening of 0.03125 for the US dollar compared to the morning opening. It was heard that after the close, due to HSBC's sluggish buying, the British pound rose again to five pence, and the US dollar eased again to eight yuan 3.34375.

British Pound Closes at Five Pence

In the after-market, continued selling pressure from Hong Kong banks and strong buying interest from a certain bank caused conditions to slightly firm up amidst the quiet. The British pound briefly broke through the five-pence mark. It was estimated that Hong Kong Telecom sold spot British pounds to HSBC at five pence 0.15625. At the time, a certain bank also sold spot US dollars to Chinese merchants at eight yuan 3.375. Later, the British pound reached a high of over five pence 0.3125. Afterwards, selling pressure eased, and conditions stabilized slightly. By the evening close, banks' selling prices for spot transactions were five pence for the British pound and eight yuan 3.34375 for the US dollar. This month's prices were the same as spot prices.

### Cash Prices Intended to Rise but Fell Instead, Hong Kong Banks Buying Unable to Resist Selling Pressure

Yesterday's cash silver bullion unofficial market saw a difficult recovery, and with foreign exchange rates weakening, buying was less active than selling. Although the market fluctuated throughout the day, it merely followed the fluctuations in the exchange market. At the opening, conditions were firm, due to tight and soft foreign exchange rates and buying from Hong Kong banks. Prices jumped by 30 yuan to 3,810 yuan. After the opening, as foreign exchange rates firmed up, Tianjin banks, silver shops, and certain gold shops sold off, immediately reaching a low of 3,735 yuan.

By the midday close, as foreign exchange rates firmed up again, gold shops closed at 3,760 yuan. In the afternoon, as foreign exchange rates continued to firm up, money changers sold off. Subsequently, as Hong Kong banks absorbed the selling pressure, the price rose from 3,747 yuan to 3,775 yuan. By the close, the price was 3,770 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading remained brisk, with approximately 2,800 taels traded. Silver jewelry prices initially rose before falling, ultimately remaining unchanged. Customs gold and other precious metals remained flat.

Silver Bullion Falls Slightly by 10 Yuan

From early morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened with strong momentum due to news of softening foreign exchange rates and strong buying from client banks, jumping by 30 yuan. Money changers bought ten taels from gold shops at 3,810 yuan. Suddenly, news came of a softening trend in foreign exchange rates, and momentum weakened. Securities firms, silver shops, and certain gold shops began selling aggressively. Although a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop bought over 200 taels on behalf of Hong Kong banks, they could not match the selling pressure, and the price fell by 75 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 taels to money changers at 3,735 yuan. Subsequently, foreign exchange rates suddenly softened again, leading to bargain hunting, and Hong Kong banks commissioned a certain gold shop to buy, immediately pushing the price up by 45 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 30 taels from a certain silver shop at 3,780 yuan. At midday, foreign exchange rates suddenly firmed up again, and money changers and gold shops competed to sell. At the same time, Hong Kong banks' buying appetite weakened, and the price fell by 25 yuan. Gold shops and money changers sold a total of 50 taels to a certain gold shop (on behalf of Hong Kong banks) at 3,755 yuan. Later, money changers bought 20 taels from securities firms at 3,760 yuan as the midday closing price. In the early afternoon, as foreign exchange rates continued to firm up, the price fell slightly by 10 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to gold shops at 3,750 yuan. Subsequently, the price recovered by 5 yuan, and another securities firm bought 20 taels from silver shops at 3,755 yuan. Later, money changers sold off, and the price fell again by 8 yuan. Money changers sold 10 taels to securities firms at 3,747 yuan. Afterwards, a certain silver shop suddenly searched for and bought on behalf of client banks, pushing the price up by 28 yuan.

Gold Certificates Continue to Weaken

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw strong demand for British and American gold sovereigns, and the market was firm. However, due to the weakening of foreign exchange rates, demand for British and American gold certificates was sluggish, and the market continued to weaken. Demand for Hong Kong notes was scarce, and the market weakened. Demand for French franc notes remained strong, and the market price slightly increased. Supply of Singapore and Dutch notes increased, and the market weakened. Demand for Annam notes was strong due to travel needs, and the market was quite buoyant. Canadian notes weakened due to the weakening of American gold certificates. Demand for Japanese gold certificates was sluggish, with the evening market at 1 yuan 3.14 cents.

There were no changes to the interest rates for interbank call loans and national currency.

### Securities Foreign Stocks Buy-in Rebounds - Domestic Prices Slightly Decline -

Yesterday's unofficial securities market saw a trend towards sideways trading and weakness, with trading further decreasing. Most were watching the market, with the general sentiment slightly bearish. However, the bullish side showed no signs of wavering, but their enthusiasm for adding positions had ceased. In addition, a certain party in the Japanese settlement was holding an important meeting. Although it was known to be a scheme, people were uneasy, causing the market price to struggle to rise. However, a fall of 0.05 to 0.07 would likely trigger resistance from the bullish side to maintain stability. Yesterday's trading was scarce, and the volume of purchases and sales by various firms was small. There were no significant trades that attracted attention. Only the major bullish players had not taken action. The final market prices, except for Ding, were slightly lower by 0.05 to 0.1, while 96 fell by 0.15. The trading volume was only around 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 585.0 584.5 585.0 Down 0.0

Unified B 505.0 504.0 505.0 Down 0.0

Unified C 489.0 486.0 487.0 Down 0.15

Unified D 486.0 484.0 48.0 Flat

Unified Mao 489.0 487.5 488.5 Down 0.05

In the stock market, 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 15 yuan. The Shanghai Public Exchange's stock market opened flat and dull, with prices remaining unchanged. Trading volume was slightly lower. After the afternoon trading began, public interest suddenly increased, and the prices of stocks such as Shanghai Silver Company, China Corporation, Rubber, and Steel stocks attracted significant attention.

Regarding the current London market price for raw rubber, it is approximately 10.75 pence per pound. It is unlikely that this price will rise further and will likely remain stable. Therefore, the market is unlikely to see a selling trend for various rubber products. The growing interest in rubber from various well-known publications is not without reason. During this time of war, statistical information is limited, but it is known that US rubber consumption in August reached 50,500 tons, an increase of 6,600 tons compared to July. At the same time, August inventories decreased by 13,000 tons. However, shipments of rubber bound for the US were slightly higher. As the amount needed for barter agreements is 80,000 tons, the 70% quota will likely remain unchanged.

London, 26th Dispatch. Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained quiet, with no changes in various bonds at different price levels.

### Yarn and Cotton Mills Open, Yarn Market Declines

Yesterday's yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, weakened again due to the easing of exchange rates. In addition, customer demand lacked substantial development capacity. As the mills loosened their stance and sold at high prices, sentiment weakened. Although the source of raw cotton remained constant, prices were unlikely to fall significantly. Therefore, the mills' costs increased, and prices were unlikely to fall significantly. The fundamental problem was weak actual sales, and the goods held by hoarders had not yet been released. For the time being, buying interest was weak. The overall trend may remain sideways, and a new outlook requires the impetus of actual demand.

Spot yarn prices fell as customer banks showed no significant improvement and prices were high. Speculators sold aggressively, leading to a fall of 15 yuan. The spot price for Double Horse yarn at foreign warehouses was 662 yuan, and warehouse receipts were rarely inquired about. The opening price for raw materials rose slightly before rising before softening, and selling pressure suddenly increased, gradually declining to 660 yuan. The trading volume for half a day was 1,340 bales. Prices fell by 15.5 yuan for 20-count Double Horse yarn and 17 yuan for Sky Girl yarn and 15 yuan for Double Globe yarn. Shenxin No. 2 Mill sold 1,000 bales of 20-count Sky Girl yarn at 650 yuan and 200 bales of New Sky Girl yarn at 660 yuan. Today's exports included 1,100 pieces to Haiphong and 80 pieces to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various firms are recorded on the left:

Same Trade 900 Hong Kong 310 Inland 65 North Firms 15 Wenzhou 10 Xiamen 10 Total 1,340

### Local Cotton Mill Transactions Pick Up, Next Month's Fire Machine Cotton Sales Already Underway

Local cotton transactions showed signs of picking up. Hongzhang and Shenxin No. 2 Mills had some demand, but Japanese mills' buying interest was still limited. Trading was active, and 1,000 bales of Fire Machine cotton for next month's delivery were traded. Therefore, although the yarn market remained weak, the cotton business was still sustainable. Market prices were affected by the yarn market, falling slightly by 1-2 yuan. Sources from Northern Jiangsu included 1,403 bales arriving at Tongzhou cotton and 1,460 bales from North Sha. The sales and transaction records for spot cotton are listed below:

Changyinsha 131.00 Shenxin Mill purchased 500 bales sent to the mill with banknotes

Tongzhou Cotton 130.00 Same trade purchased 400 bales delivered at the warehouse

In other news, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai were sluggish due to the unpredictable foreign exchange rates. Mills had no buying interest, and traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Japanese mills have had no trade recently, and several days have passed since the last transaction. The general opinion is that the current cotton prices are unlikely to improve.

The foreign cotton market saw that New York cotton prices strengthened in the early morning due to buying pressure. Traders believed that the Neutrality Act would undoubtedly pass, so buyers were enthusiastic. Later, cotton prices weakened due to selling from short sellers and profit-taking by long sellers. Closing prices fell by 3-4 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton rose by 1 rupee, Egyptian cotton rose by 20 pounds, and Liverpool cotton rose by 7 pence.

### Grains Japanese Merchants Hoard Rice - New Early Rice Prices Rise

Yesterday, various firms received only 2,000-3,000 bags of rice from Baotou via wagons, so sentiment was firm again. Most rice merchants held their positions and were unwilling to sell easily. Local merchants also had a positive outlook and were actively purchasing. Therefore, the market was tight in the morning, and prices rose. However, as the market rose, boat and rice merchants sold at high prices, causing the market to weaken again. As a result, the market showed a mixed picture of rising and falling prices. New early rice and customer-grade rice rose by 0.35 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged. Transactions included 31.5 yuan for premium Changxi specialty rice, 28 yuan for second-grade rice, 30 yuan to 27-28 yuan for rice that broke, 30 yuan for premium Sutongchang specialty rice, 26-27 yuan for second-grade rice, 30.05 yuan for kind, 30.02 yuan for kiln kind, 31 yuan for wild rice, 29.40 yuan to 28.40 yuan for Maple Canada rice, 27.5 yuan to 26.5 yuan for Songjiang Canada rice, 25.45 yuan for Nangang early rice that broke, 23.5 yuan for premium Yangjian rice, 21.5 yuan for second-grade rice, 24 yuan for premium Lujian rice, 22.5 yuan for second-grade rice, 20.02 yuan to 19.8 yuan for Jiangbei rice, 20.025 yuan for premium Wuhu rice, 18.75 yuan for second-grade rice, 30 yuan to 28-29 yuan for aged 275 yuan. The total trading volume for the city was approximately 8,000 bags.

In other news, due to poor harvests in customer Jiangbei rice declined to on the basis of a loss. Although there were 60,000 to 70,000 bags of rice in storage in Jiangbei, the cost was above 20 yuan. Therefore, rice remained in storage, and new shipments were largely halted. Although Japanese merchants had piles of in Wuhu and this city, they were unwilling to sell in large quantities on the market. Yesterday, only a small amount was traded, and the market continued to increase by 0.2-0.3 yuan.

### Customer Banks Trade in Bulk, Flour Mills Restrict Supply, Wheat Rises Slightly

Flour transactions continued to be quiet. Although both North and South customer firms intended to purchase, flour mills restricted supply and refused to trade with large firms. The circulation of floating warehouse receipts on the market gradually decreased, and the market gradually became quiet. In addition to local daily needs and scattered transactions, customer sales were minimal. No. 2 flour mill's price remained at 7.3 yuan, supplying only local retail sales. The price for passenger cars and Green Soldier boats was 7.4 to 7.5 yuan, and the market was still in the process of developing. Today, 6,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.

The source of wheat remained scarce. Since the sharp rise the previous day, sellers have been more resistant to lowering prices, and mills have been hesitant to purchase. Traders have also been watching the market due to high prices. As a result, the market still rose slightly. The highest price has reached 11.1 yuan. Today, 770 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market Foreign Sugar Weakens

### Love is Healthy Vitality

A weak man is certainly a sinner in love!

Rather than saying "Love is [missing text] work", it is better to say "Love is healthy vitality." Because there are many men who, although they sit and eat all day, doing nothing, constantly mingling with their wives, if some part of his body shows weakness and incompetence, and he cannot coordinate with his wife and obtain joy in love life, his love will secretly escape! Once love between husband and wife is lost, family life is like ice and charcoal being incompatible, so anger and quarrels arise, or even lead to tragedies such as elopement, divorce, and suicide! Conversely, if the man is healthy and the woman is beautiful, even if the husband is driven by the whip of life, busy and toiling all day long; or goes on a long journey, separated from his wife, their love will never diminish due to being busy or separated. They will surely cherish each other in their hearts from afar. Whenever there is an opportunity, they will seek a way to reunite. At that time, the [missing text] sweetness will be as fast as enjoying being an immortal. Even if the seas run dry and the stones crumble, this love will not change, giving birth to clever children, and organizing a happy family. How glorious and happy is life!

The ironclad proof shows that love is undoubtedly a healthy vitality. So why do men lose their health, thus falling into a tragic situation in life? According to medical opinions, it is mostly because men committed self [missing text] seminal emission in their early years, or early marriage and indulgence, which exhausted their reproductive gland fluid. Thus, all kinds of symptoms such as neurasthenia, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging are not uncommon. Such sick men not only have difficulty in achieving conjugal bliss with their wives, becoming sinners in love, but may even affect reproduction, resulting in infertility and childlessness. Even if they have children, they will also be weak and sickly! In addition, because of exhaustion, they often give up on academic pursuits and find it difficult to be competent in their careers, or even die from illness, dying young. How dangerous is this!

Today, the above-mentioned symptoms are no longer incurable. If treated with the right and effective medicine, it can certainly be cured in a matter of days. What is the effective medicine? It is the reproductive gland extract "Reproductin." Because this preparation is made by extracting the reproductive gland extracts from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, sea dogs, bears, deer, etc., and refining it using a concentration and reproduction method, its quality is precious, its nature is peaceful, and its nourishing power is active and thorough, exceeding any similar preparation. Therefore, after taking it, it can generate sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish nerves within one day and night. Regular use can also promote development and regulate metabolism. It can certainly cure various symptoms radically in a short period of time, making the body even healthier. Therefore, world-renowned doctors recommend this preparation as the only sacred medicine specifically for nourishing weak men. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills" to stop the leakage, so that treating the symptoms and addressing the root cause are implemented at the same time, and the effect will be even more rapid. Based on my experience of more than ten years, I have used this preparation (available at Wing On Pharmacy and Wuzhou Chinese and Western Pharmacy) to cure no less than tens of thousands of patients.

### Symptomatic Treatment of Seminal Emission

Specialist in Venereal Diseases, Zhan Nianceng

The right medicine is like opening a lock. This is indeed true. Therefore, the German medical sage Dr. Schmidt once said: "There is no incurable disease in the world, but it is difficult to find the right medicine." The prosperity of German medicine is probably due in no small part to the doctor's efforts. Dr. Schmidt also used his decades of experience to secretly manufacture a kind of "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills", specializing in the treatment of seminal emission, spermatorrhea, sperm leakage and other symptoms. The effect is indeed effective. It has been sold all over the world and has been praised by everyone. It is praised by Chinese and foreign doctors as the most symptomatic sacred medicine for treating seminal emission! Considering why young people suffer from seminal emission: most of them must be due to self-inflicted indulgence, or overwork and injuries, which have damaged the sexual nerves, resulting in the relaxation of the seminal valve. A drop that is not stopped will burst into rivers and seas. Although seminal emission is very slight at the beginning, it must be treated quickly to prevent future troubles. There are many cases where people who delay treatment and do not receive treatment change from mild nocturnal emission to dreamless spermatorrhea and daytime sperm leakage. There are even more cases where seminal emission over time leads to sperm exhaustion and blood depletion, resulting in brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging. Most of these young people are listless and depressed. Failure in study, unemployment, and love failure are inevitable results; even for those who are married, the life of the couple must not be satisfactory, and all kinds of tragedies in the family will arise. Life at this point, how much pain! If you want to seek remedy, you must never seek medical treatment or take medicine indiscriminately, so as not to fall into a desperate situation! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, it is still necessary to take the sacred medicine for treating seminal emission "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills" to consolidate the seminal valve and stop leakage. In addition, it is also necessary to take the world's only brain and kidney tonic, the reproductive gland extract "Reproductin" to fundamentally nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, promote development, and regulate metabolism. Continued use will certainly cure various symptoms in a short period of time and make you healthier.

Patient Li Zhigao, a native of Guangdong, was five years old. Because of seminal emission that was not treated, he rashly married. After marriage, he was unable to perform sexually, and was hated by his wife. Moreover, because of brain weakness and insomnia, he recently became unemployed. He came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment last month. After a detailed examination of his condition, he was instructed to purchase "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills" and "Reproductin" at Huamei Pharmacy for simultaneous use. He was also given electrotherapy injections. After only one month, he has now recovered. The couple's love life is happy and he has also obtained a new job at a certain company.

### How Important is the Development of the Breasts! American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

No matter where you are, women always have an advantage over men. Beautiful and healthy women have even more advantages over mediocre and ugly women. This is an ironclad fact. Therefore, all women want to be healthy and beautiful, fragrant and sweet everywhere, and be welcomed by everyone. She is like a peony among the flowers, appearing elegant, graceful and incomparably beautiful.

But is fulfilling the heart's desire not a hidden regret since ancient times! Some of them are weak and frail due to malnutrition since childhood, so even after the period of spring love, they are still weak and frail, with no plump curves at all, and there is no way to talk about health and beauty. Some have a pretty face, but unfortunately, she has constricted her chest since childhood, failed to recuperate after illness, suffered from leucorrhea, irregular menstruation, excessive lust, postpartum deficiency, etc., which caused damage to the function of the reproductive gland ovaries, affecting metabolism. Therefore, the body cannot produce a large number of new cells. Naturally, the muscles are thin and the complexion is sallow. The breasts do not have good development, and the buttocks must also be thin and lack plumpness. Therefore, the characteristic beauty of women is completely lost. How can she compete in the arena of love and obtain her ideal husband. Not only that, but such women mostly suffer from decreased sexual desire and uterine coldness due to the withered breasts and lack of reproductive gland ovary secretion.

### Negotiations on Building Roads Beyond Boundaries: The Bureau of Works' Plan is Sent Out; Delivered to the Puppet Mayor the Night Before Yesterday; Fan Keling had Second Talks with Fu [missing text]; The Two Sides' Opinions are Incompatible, Making it Unlikely

Negotiations on building roads beyond boundaries, with the leadership consul Colonel Naroni of the leading group mediating from the side, the Director-General of the Bureau of Works Fan Keling visited Fu [missing text] on the evening of the 23rd, breaking the deadlock. The Director-General and President of the Bureau of Works, Fei Maolipu, and the Chief of the Police Department of the Bureau, Bao En, discussed several "Proposed Guidelines" to serve as a basic plan to resolve the dispute between the Bureau of Works and the puppet "Municipal Government". According to the reporter of Dazhong News Agency, the plan has been drafted and was delivered to Fu Xiaoan by the Director-General Keling of the Bureau of Works on the evening of [missing text] (26th). It is heard that Fu held a banquet at his official residence in the "City Center Area" to entertain [missing text], but the results of the second meeting are kept secret by both sides. It is heard that Fu Xiaoan only expressed a reserved attitude towards the plan. The reporter of Dazhong News Agency also learned from an authoritative source in diplomatic circles that the principle of the Bureau of Works for solving the issue of building roads beyond boundaries in the Western District is to focus on joint management. Representatives from the Bureau of Works and the puppet municipal government will form a special management agency together. It is also believed that this is a considerable concession proposal, but on the side of the puppet municipal government, Fu Xiaoan proposed two prerequisites when he first met with Fan Keling on the evening of the 23rd: insisting on the "full takeover" of building roads beyond boundaries in the Western District and requesting the Bureau of Works to completely transfer the taxation rights, police rights, and all other administrative rights of building roads beyond boundaries to the jurisdiction of the puppet municipal government. The opinions of the two sides are like [missing text] and are difficult to reconcile, so the future is unlikely to be optimistic.

This dispute was resolved yesterday in the Port Director's office through the mediation of Sugiyama, the Japanese Acting Port Director of the Jianghai Customs. According to the reporter of Dazhong News Agency, the solution is that 40% of the vegetable boats coming to Shanghai in the future will unload goods at Touba, and 60% will unload goods at the Old Gate Bridge.

### Subsidy Issue Resolved: Postmen Resumed Work Yesterday Afternoon; Subsidies Increased by Ten Yuan Across the Board Starting from September; Request for Fifteen Yuan Will be Reported to the General Bureau by Telegram; Backlogged Mail Delivered in Full That Evening

More than 1,000 postmen and coolies from the Shanghai Postal Administration, its branches, and inland bureaus announced a temporary cessation of work and implemented a work slowdown from 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday due to the unfair subsidy treatment from the bureau. All mail delivery in the area completely stopped. The Postal Workers' Union convened a meeting of representatives from various branches the evening before to discuss countermeasures, and notified all members to strictly abide by order and wait for a solution. At around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, representatives Cheng Zuoqing, Ye Fusheng, Sun Zhudong, Wang Kai, Shen Wenxun, and Sun Hanliang were sent to meet with Director-General Zapeilin to request approval for additional subsidies. After consultation, Zapeilin agreed to increase the subsidies for all postal workers: (1) Starting from September, the subsidies for all postmen and coolies will be increased by two and a half yuan across the board, totaling ten yuan, and will be supplemented when salaries are paid in November. (2) The request for a universal increase of fifteen yuan will be reported to the Kunming Postal General Bureau by the bureau for further request. The representatives considered this satisfactory and announced a resolution.

All Postal Workers Quickly Resumed Work

After the negotiations were successfully resolved, representatives from the Postal Workers' Union were responsible for notifying all members of the various branches and inland bureaus to resume work immediately. All postal workers announced their resumption of work at 11:00 a.m. First, they sorted out more than 140 bags of local mail that had been backlogged the day before, immediately set off, and delivered it together with yesterday's mail. Therefore, all of it was delivered by the evening, and the situation was very good. The bureau also expressed great satisfaction with the workers' spirit of service.

Police Detectives Retreated Yesterday Afternoon

When a work slowdown trend occurred among all postal workers the day before, the Central Police Department, upon receiving a report, immediately dispatched a police car and a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the bureau's vicinity for strict prevention and protection in order to maintain order and prevent accidents caused by intruders. After the negotiations were successfully concluded yesterday morning and the postal workers announced their resumption of work, the detectives stationed by the police department completely withdrew before 12:00 p.m. yesterday, and everything has returned to normal.

### Chinese Guerrillas Successfully Destroyed Rail Tracks; 500 Meters of Rail Tracks Destroyed at Wangting; Passenger Trains to and from Shanghai and Nanjing are All Delayed

Late the night before yesterday (26th), a section of rail tracks west of Wangting Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, stretching for more than 500 meters to Zhoujing Lane, was destroyed by Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, the early train from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday morning failed to arrive in Shanghai, and the early passenger train from Shanghai to Nanjing did not depart until 10:00 a.m. and ended at Suzhou Station. Yesterday morning, more than 100 Japanese soldiers rode to the scene of the accident to stand guard, but the Chinese guerrillas had already retreated. Another Japanese train, which was being transferred to Nanjing, also got off the train and walked to Zhoujing Lane before transferring to Beijing when it arrived at Wangting due to the destroyed tracks. It is heard that the destroyed rail tracks were not repaired until around 3:00 p.m. yesterday.

### Japanese Mines Outside of Aojiang Repeatedly Exploded; Japanese Planes Flew to Lishui Wenxi and Dropped Five Bombs, Killing Only One Person

According to definite news in the shipping industry, the Japanese have been laying a large number of mines outside the mouth of the Aojiang River since they declared military action against Aotou. Those laid near Lingkun outside the mouth of Wenzhou are densely packed, so explosions occur from time to time. There was a tragic incident a few days ago in which seventeen fishing boats were struck by mines and exploded. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Wenzhou salt boat smuggled salt from Xiashan for import, but accidentally triggered a mine and exploded. The boat was shattered and more than a dozen boatmen were torn to pieces. The situation was extremely tragic. The Japanese are now sending warships to repair the opposing lock line. Since the Japanese warships in the eastern coastal area of Zhejiang unsuccessfully shelled Xiangshan Port on the 21st, they still show signs of making trouble. Two Japanese warships anchored off Ligang in the waters outside Zhenhai Port. One of them has escaped yesterday morning, and the other is still anchored in its original location without any changes. In addition, a Japanese aircraft carrier anchored off Leqing dispatched a water bomber to Lishui Wenxi on the afternoon of the 16th, dropping five bombs, killing one person and destroying more than seventy houses, with no other losses.

### Wuxi Guerrillas Attacked Silk Cocoon Trucks; Two Trucks Escaped, Two Were Intercepted; Escorting Japanese Soldiers Killed Two

The Japanese side has established a "Central China Silk Company" for the silk industry in the Southeast region. All silk cocoon business in the occupied areas is controlled by the company. On the 7th of this month, the Wuxi branch of the company used four trucks to transport cocoons purchased in Heqiao Town, west of Wuxi, back to Wuxi. On the way, they were attacked by Chinese guerrillas near Huacang Mountain. At that time, it was around 1:00 p.m. When the first truck drove to the eastern end of Huacang Mountain, 200 Chinese guerrillas had gathered there and fired at the truck. The truck driver and police officer increased their speed and drove out in the rain of bullets. Later, the second and third trucks came one after another, and the sound of grenades from the roadside was as dense as a string of beads. Although the second truck still drove away at risk, the third truck thought that the car in front had been blown up, so it stopped suddenly, and the fourth truck also continued to stop because the road was blocked.

More than ten Japanese accompanying guards jumped out of the car and hid in the bushes. At the same time, the Chinese guerrillas' attack intensified. Although the Japanese also fought back, the disparity between the two sides was too great. The Japanese escorting soldiers Ishikawa Teruji and Tokuda Masao, who had served as sergeant and private first class in the Japanese artillery, fought back with pistols on the roadside. Tokuda's buttocks, head, and chest were all hit by machine gun bullets and he died on the spot. Ishikawa also died soon after being hit in the chest.

Only the remaining people escaped.

All 15 bags of cocoons and several pistols and rifles abandoned by the Japanese were taken away by the guerrillas. When the Japanese army heard the news and rushed to the scene, the guerrillas had already returned to their original location.

### The Bureau of Works Changed the Exchange Rate for Retirement Savings to Consider the Interests of All Parties and Reduce Unexpected Expenses

The Bureau of Works changed the guaranteed exchange rate for the retirement savings of foreign employees due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange. It issued a special notice yesterday, saying: The guaranteed exchange rate for the retirement savings of foreign employees of the Bureau, except for those who were already eligible for exchange rate subsidies in accordance with the terms of service before July 1937, is now guaranteed by the Bureau at the exchange rate when the payment is made, which is one national currency equivalent to one light gold of British gold, or 100 national currency equivalent to 86 Japanese gold, or 24.85 US dollars. This guarantee method has been implemented since June 1, 1938. At that time, due to the sharp drop in the exchange rate, it was considered that the losses should be borne jointly by the Bureau and the employees. The Bureau is willing to maintain this principle. However, because the exchange rate has fallen further recently, the Bureau's burden has become heavier, and it deeply feels that this situation cannot be allowed to remain unchanged for a long time. Therefore, the Bureau has been forced to change the guaranteed exchange rate for retirement savings deposited on or after May 1, 1940, to one national currency equivalent to eight pence of British gold, or 100 national currency equivalent to 57.33 Japanese gold, or 16.42 US dollars. If the exchange rate does not improve in the future, this change will indeed cause the foreign employees of the Bureau to sacrifice quite a bit when receiving their retirement savings. However, if the guaranteed exchange rate is not revised and the Bureau is allowed to continue to bear the considerable unexpected expenses, it will not be a good strategy for the interests of all parties.

### Beans Going to the Philippines Must Have a Certificate

Beans and bean cakes transported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to the Philippines must now have a certificate in order to be imported. The following is the notice issued by the Philippine Overseas Chinese Aid Resistance Committee on the 9th of this month: For notice matters, this committee previously received a letter from the Overseas Chinese Import and Export Chamber of Commerce inquiring about domestic products exported to the Philippines, such as melon seeds, soybeans, mung beans, black beans, red beans, white sesame, peanuts, small bean cakes, wood ears, golden needles, garlic, shallots, potatoes, ham, walnuts, chestnuts, etc. Although these sixteen items are not from the four northeastern provinces and have not been explicitly banned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, the places of origin of these goods have all been occupied, so we are also in the prohibited list. The 12th meeting of the Resistance Department of this Committee discussed this and decided that in addition to beans and bean cakes, all beans and bean cakes produced in the four northeastern provinces will not be allowed to be imported from the date of the notice. Those exported from Shanghai and Hong Kong must obtain a certificate from the Shanghai Industry Association and the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce proving that the goods are not subject to control before they can be imported. At the same time, the number of items received, the type of labels, and bean samples must be submitted to the committee for verification. The committee is currently studying other items and will report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions, and will inform you again. Accordingly, it is recorded and all overseas Chinese merchants are informed. This is a special notice.

### The President's Round-Trip Ship Also Goes to Shanghai; Temporary Changes After the European War; The Kreifeld Will Arrive in Port Tomorrow

The American President Lines' ships, from August 3 to March 14 next year, follow the new route, which is from the United States via Japan to Shanghai, to Hong Kong and then to Xiaoluzong. From Xiaoluzong on the return trip to Hong Kong, it will go straight to Japan and back to the United States and will not come to Shanghai. However, since the outbreak of the European war, the goods transported from Shanghai to the United States have been more prosperous than before. In order to adapt to the current situation, the company has temporarily changed the new route, that is, the ships that are currently scheduled to depart from the United States and come to Shanghai will be changed to come to Shanghai when returning from Xiaoluzong in order to load more goods for transportation to the United States. This will be implemented starting from the next train's Tiger Tall President. The Kreifeld President, temporarily ordered to come to Shanghai as well, was originally scheduled to arrive in port yesterday, but it is now heard that it has been delayed by one day and will arrive in Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. today. The big wheel is scheduled to leave for Japan and return to the United States from 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, the 29th. The last connecting small wheel will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

### Yesterday was US Navy Day - All ceremonies cancelled, only the Marines drilled at the Race Course - Flagship crew each given a day off

The English-language "China Press" reports that, although today (the 27th) is US Navy Day, the US authorities have not prepared various receptions and other activities as in previous years. The US Asiatic Fleet's flagship, the USS Augusta, which in the past would host visits from the American community in Shanghai on this holiday, did not hold this reception today. However, this afternoon, the US Marines and Navy sailors drilled at the Race Course, reviewed by Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze Patrol. The crew of the Augusta were given a day off. The Royal Air Force Association held a banquet at its headquarters in the HSBC Building, entertaining Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, his Chief of Staff Colonel Carroll, and other staff officers.

### Mitsui Company Publicly Seizing Eggs in Shanghai - Over Five Thousand Baskets Seized One After Another - All Broken, Canned, and Sold to Britain - British Ambassador to Protest to Tokyo

The English-language "China Press" reports that foreign egg-canning factories in Shanghai, including two American and five British companies, are having the eggs they purchased in the interior seized by the Japanese company Mitsui. Mitsui's shamelessness reached its peak when they seized an entire cart of eggs, totaling 122 baskets, on Broadway Road. Between October 10th and 24th, no fewer than 5,215 baskets of eggs, each containing 800 eggs, were seized and taken to Mitsui's factory on Huangpu Road. Mitsui then broke the eggs, canned them, and sold them in large quantities to Britain. This kind of

Seizure Operation

has been reported to the British and American embassies, and it is expected that they will protest to the Tokyo government accordingly. At the same time, the supply of eggs to these British and American factories is dwindling, and their output is very small. It has been investigated that Mitsui Company's egg refrigeration and canning factory on Huangpu Road originally belonged to Maochang Company, which was forced to withdraw. Now the factory is nominally the Yangtze Egg Company, but it is actually owned and operated by Mitsui Company. The method used by various companies to purchase eggs is to send people to the egg-producing areas at the mouth of the Yangtze River to purchase them with cash and transport them to the

Yangtze River Port.

Currently, almost only Japanese ships are allowed to carry goods. The freight is calculated at the port of loading and paid upon arrival in Shanghai. Some eggs are transported by the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway, but when they are transferred to Japanese ships for transport to Shanghai, the goods are refused to be delivered. When representatives from various companies go to pick up the eggs, they are told that they have received orders not to deliver the eggs to the legitimate consignees, but to Mitsui Company. Recently, a certain British company purchased eggs and had them transported to Shanghai by a certain shipping company. The shipping company directly delivered the eggs to

Mitsui Company

and even had the audacity to present the freight bill to the legitimate consignee for payment, which was of course refused. Before the European War, nine out of ten of the egg products exported from Shanghai went to Britain. It is generally believed that this figure has now increased. Mitsui Company is indeed seizing eggs belonging to American and British companies, canning them, and shipping them directly to Britain. The cart of eggs seized by Mitsui Company employees on Broadway Road belonged to a British egg-packing

refrigeration company

in Yangshupu. These eggs had just arrived at the McGonagil Road station and were being transported by a cart of 122 baskets to Yangshupu. The seizure took place on Broadway Road, which is within the International Settlement. This seems to have made Mitsui Company personnel somewhat uneasy, and they immediately sent a letter to the British company, saying that if the company would provide a letter stating "it is understood that the Mitsui Company made a temporary mistake," they would be willing to return the eggs. However, the British company has refused to issue such a letter. The current situation is as described, with no further developments.

### The Pseudo-Finance Bureau Plans to Impose Heavy Taxes - Business Tax of 1.5% - And Arbitrarily Assesses Capital

It has been learned from relevant sources that the pseudo-"Finance Bureau", following the orders of the pseudo-"Municipal Government", prepared in the spring of this year to levy a "business tax" on various industries, stipulating a rate of 0.3% based on capital. However, due to opposition from residents in various districts, it was suspended until now, and the tax was not levied. Now, the bureau, finding that the pseudo-"Municipal Government" is running out of funds, has decisively decided to implement the tax levy. In the past week, it has dispatched pseudo-officials to various industries and businesses to investigate capital and turnover. However, it is not collecting taxes according to the prescribed tax rate, but forcibly charging merchants a heavy tax of 1.5%. At the same time, it is arbitrarily assessing capital and randomly specifying the amount of tax to be paid. Merchants who dare to object are subject to detention. It is said that merchants in various districts have decided to resist unanimously and refuse to pay the tax.

### Secretary of the International Red Cross, Baker, to Travel to the United States

Dr. Baker, Secretary-General of the International Red Cross, has been working hard on relief efforts since the Battle of Shanghai. Recently, Dr. Baker and his wife will soon leave Shanghai for the United States. Local Chinese and Western friends, appreciating his enthusiasm for disaster relief, have arranged a farewell dinner for Dr. and Mrs. Baker on the evening of the eighth of next month at the Hengfa Lu (transliteration) Restaurant, No. 343 Hankou Road.

### Two Chinese Sailors on German Ships Died En Route to Kobe

The German company Hamburg Lines' ships "Oldenburg" and "Meissen", left Shanghai before the outbreak of the European War, heading to the United States via Japan. Unexpectedly, when the ships arrived in Yokohama, the war broke out, so they stayed in Yokohama harbor. The seventy-five Chinese sailors among them also stayed in Japan. Recently, when the Dollar Line's President Pierce sailed from the US via Japan to Shanghai, the Chinese sailors boarded the President Pierce to Shanghai. The ship arrived here on the morning of the 25th. Among them were two sailors from the Oldenburg, who unfortunately died while the ship was en route to Kobe. The passengers on the President Pierce, sympathizing with the plight of the two Chinese sailors, generously donated money to cover the cost of burial for the deceased's families.

### Factory Registration in This City - Can Temporarily Report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs

### Workers' Demands at the American-Asian Silk Factory - Hopeful of a Satisfactory Resolution

More than 500 workers at the No. 4 factory of the American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory on Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai, due to the recent rise in prices and the difficulty of living, unanimously demanded improved treatment from the factory on the 26th, and once went on strike. At that time, the labor side elected ten representatives to negotiate directly with the factory's deputy manager, Mr. Tong Xinbo, and put forward four demands: (1) Restore pre-war wages; (2) Restore room and board; (3) Restore the warp and weft subsidies; (4) Issue a living allowance of six yuan per month. It is reported that the negotiation went very well. The factory agreed to restore pre-war wages from November, restore the warp and weft subsidies, increase the subsidy by three cents per day, and adjust wages and increase them appropriately from January 1 next year. The labor side expressed deep gratitude for the factory's sincere attitude. However, the two major issues of room and board and living allowances have not been agreed on, and negotiations are continuing. It is expected to be resolved satisfactorily soon.

### Rickshaw Operators Decide to Announce Publicly - Passengers Will Increase Fares Appropriately

The Rickshaw Association of the Special District, due to the soaring prices of hardware materials, although it has requested the Municipal Council to increase fares, has been repeatedly rejected. However, other public utilities, such as tap water, tap fire (gas), electricity, buses, trams, taxis, etc., as well as social businesses, have all increased prices unanimously. The Municipal Council alone refuses to allow this industry to increase fares. Therefore, a representative meeting of the five districts was convened yesterday afternoon, with more than one hundred people attending. Mr. Yin Zhiling presided over the meeting, reporting on the circumstances of requesting a fare increase and the current market price of materials, which has increased by at least three to four times. The original fare is really impossible to maintain. It was decided to announce to passengers in all circles that fares will be increased appropriately to maintain the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers and to facilitate fare increases.

### German Consul Langtao Departs Shanghai to Return to His Country - Transferred to Work in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs

He has recently been transferred to work in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and left Shanghai this morning (the 27th), returning to Berlin via Siberia.

### The Pseudo-"Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" - Dissolved by the Japanese Side - Due to Complex Elements and Hollow Organization - Japanese Attempts to Manipulate the Labor Movement Apparently Failed

In order to attempt to manipulate the Shanghai labor movement, hoping to broadly plant people's power for its own use, the Japanese and puppet side, in October of last year, launched the so-called "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" by the pseudo-"Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs," Hu Shouchang, claiming to act in place of the city's Federation of Trade Unions. Because after more than a year of establishment, all legitimate trade unions still refused to cooperate, resulting in a hollow internal organization with no real power, it has been ordered by the Japanese side to dissolve a few days ago. The following are the details investigated by the Daguang News Agency reporter:

Complex Elements and Hollow Organization

The pseudo-"Chinese Workers' Welfare Association," instigated by the Japanese side, was launched by the pseudo-"Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs," Hu Shouchang, and was declared established in October of last year. The association headquarters was located on the second floor of the Nisshin Company on the Bund. Hu himself served as the "President," and a Japanese man named Kuba was promoted to advisor. Lin Zihong was the "Secretary-General," and the association called for the relief of unemployment and the alleviation of the suffering of workers, attempting to win over various trade unions in the city to join in cooperation. However, the responsible persons of each trade union were well aware of justice and firmly refused to participate. The association then absorbed some degenerates and ruffians, fabricated the names of trade unions, and fabricated membership lists, practicing self-praise and self-singing in order to swindle subsidies from the Japanese side. In fact, due to complex elements, frequent power struggles, and repeated disputes, the internal organization was extremely hollow. Although it has been established for more than a year, it has no power to speak of.

Japanese Side Dissatisfied, Ordered Dissolution

The pseudo-organization was originally given a huge subsidy by the Japanese side on a monthly basis, in an attempt to cultivate people's power for its own use. However, because the trade unions of all legitimate organizations in the city refused to participate, resulting in a hollow internal organization with no achievements, the Japanese side expressed deep dissatisfaction with this. In January of this year, the subsidy was once suspended. Then, Lin Zihong went around lobbying to reorganize and plan to resume activities. But the result was still ineffective. Recently, the Japanese side discovered that the various trade unions affiliated with the "Welfare Association" had no real workers, and that the so-called representatives of various industries were mostly not members of those industries. As a result, the Japanese side became even more dissatisfied and ordered the dissolution of the pseudo-organization a few days ago, stopping its activities. Lin and other boring elements have also scattered, feeling very uninteresting.

### The German Large Motor Ship Will Moor in the Huangpu River for a Long Time - Empty Ship with a Swastika Flag - Temporarily Unable to Return to the Country Due to the Outbreak of the European War

The "Shanghai Times" reports that since the outbreak of the European War, the German motor ship "Ramses", moored in Wusong, sailed up the Huangpu River at 2 pm yesterday (the 26th) to the naval area of ​​the Huangpu River, next to buoys 11 and 11, which are 600 feet long, so that the ship could be safely moored in the area during the war and not move elsewhere. The ship's stern was hung with a swastika flag, and both sides were also painted with

Swastika symbols.

The ship was empty. Its masts and chimneys were painted yellow. If it weren't for the swastika flag, people would recognize it as a Swedish ship. The ship was slowly driven forward by two tugboats yesterday. When it passed the American ship Augusta and the American ship Isabel, it raised the flag at the stern of the ship to pay tribute, but when it passed the British and French warships in the Huangpu River, it did not pay tribute. According to reports, the Ramses left Shanghai for Europe on August 31. Because at that time

The overall situation was critical,

it sailed to Wusong and stopped. After the declaration of war on October 3, the ship could not sail out and moored at Wusong. Last week, it sailed into the Manchurian Railway Wharf in the Huangpu River to unload goods, and yesterday it sailed upstream to moor near the Dalai Wharf. The Ramses belongs to the Henme Company and weighs more than 7,983 tons. Its mooring fee in Wusong is more than 30 taels per day, and mooring at the upstream buoy is 15 taels per day.

### Pseudo-Water Patrol Team Divides Areas to Seize - Police Authority on the Bund of the Concession - South Huangpu and the West Section of the Suzhou River - Under Japanese Control and Rejection

The pseudo-"Dadao Police" "Water Patrol Team", in order to seize the police authority of the Huangpu River on the wharves of the concession, has now divided the eastern section of the Suzhou River into two districts, and the area from Wusongkou to the blockade line has been divided into two districts, placing a total of four detachments. Preparations have already begun. It is found that after the war, the water police authority from Shiliupu to Yangshupu and from the Baidu Bridge on the Suzhou River to the Xizang Road Bridge was handled by the Customs Water Police Department. Even all remote police and criminal cases were escorted by the Water Police Department to the Special District Court for trial. The "Dadao Water Patrol Team" is in the Pudong along the wharves and the Chinese wharves in Zhabei. As for the foreign warehouse wharves in Pudong, such as Longmao, Jardine Matheson, etc., incidents are still handled by the Water Police Department. Now the "Dadao Water Patrol Team" obviously wants to dominate its "water police authority" over the Huangpu River. However, the Huangpu River and Bailianjing, etc., and the western section of the Suzhou River, which were originally under the jurisdiction of the "Water Patrol Team", have been designated as a security line for the guerrilla zone by the Japanese army. Therefore, the Water Patrol Team is absolutely unable to station anyone or exercise its duties.

### Qingyu Lane Relocation Case - The Court Orders a Trial Reconciliation - The Poor Children's Home and the Women's Bank Extend the Renovation Agreement - Tenants Discover Evidence, Retrial Yesterday

The houses in Qingyu Lane, Chongqing Road, owned by the Shanghai Poor Children's Education Institute, were leased by the Shanghai Women's Bank, and there was a contract with a lease term ending on December 31, 1938. At that time, the Women's Bank must renovate the houses. Otherwise, the Shanghai Poor Children's Education Institute will confiscate the Women's Bank's deposit of 49,000 yuan and may claim compensation for losses of 150,000 yuan. Therefore, last winter, the Women's Bank ordered all tenants to relocate in order to renovate the houses. However, the three thousand tenants, because of the extraordinary times, the demand for housing in Shanghai exceeded supply, and it was impossible to find so many houses at once, so they expressed their opposition.

Which led to litigation.

The Women's Bank lost the first trial, but the second and third trial judgments followed the Women's Bank's request and ordered the tenants to relocate. When the time for execution came, before receiving a mandatory execution order from the court, the Women's Bank hired workers to build bamboo fences around Qingyu Lane, intending to forcibly demolish the houses. This led to another dispute in which the tenants dismantled the fences as legitimate self-defense to eliminate the infringement. Recently, the tenants suddenly learned that the Women's Bank and the Poor Children's Education Institute had signed a contract to extend the renovation period for three years. Immediately, they hired lawyers Yuan Yang'an and Su Jingqi and filed a

Retrial lawsuit

with the civil court of the High Court No. 2, requesting that the original judgment be overturned, the Shanghai Women's Bank's lawsuit to order relocation be dismissed, and the litigation costs be borne, and because the situation was urgent, requested a preliminary ruling to suspend the execution. They also requested that police officers be immediately ordered to go to the Shanghai Poor Children's Education Institute and the office of the institute's legal counsel, lawyer Guo Qiming, to investigate and retrieve the contract for the three-year extension of the renovation period, as well as related documents, to preserve evidence, etc. The High Court No. 2 accepted the complaint and first ordered the police to retrieve the documents that the plaintiff in the retrial requested to investigate,

Actually Retrieved Them.

Later, an order was issued to the Qingyu Lane tenants, allowing the suspension of execution after providing a deposit of 15,000 yuan, and the retrial of the case was approved upon the request of the lane tenants. Yesterday morning, the case was retried by the High Court No. 2 Civil Court President Han Zuzhi, together with Judges Shen Hong and Zhang Qinglan to form a collegiate panel. The Qingyu Lane tenants and lawyers Yuan and Su appeared in court. The Women's Bank also appointed a lawyer to appear in court. The Shanghai Poor Children's Education Institute, as a participant, also appointed lawyer Rong Zhenlong to appear in court. The Chengdu Road Police Department, in order to prevent accidents, had Chinese Chief Detective Feng Ruisheng supervise the Chinese and Western detectives to come to the court for prevention. First, lawyer Yuan stated the

Reasons for retrial,

briefly stating that the reason why the Women's Bank sued the retrial plaintiffs for relocation was based on the contract signed with the Poor Children's Education Institute, because if the house was not renovated by the end of 1938, the Women's Bank would suffer a loss of 200,000 yuan. Now, the retrial plaintiffs have found that before the end of the debate in the original case's second trial, the contract had been extended for three years by mutual agreement. This can be proved by the documents retrieved by the court. Therefore, since the renovation period has been extended and the rent has been reduced by 20%, the statements made in the original trial

Were completely false,

causing more than three thousand tenants to suffer an unfavorable judgment and almost face the hardship of displacement. Now that there is this strong evidence, we should apply to the court for a retrial to overturn the original judgment and issue a judgment dismissing the retrial defendant's application, etc. Then, the court ordered lawyers Zhou Zhiyi and Guo Qiming and Guo Shouchun, the director of the Poor Children's Education Institute, to come to court to testify that the fact that the extension contract was signed, and the lawyer representing the Women's Bank stated that the signing of this contract was precisely because it would be difficult to achieve

Renovation purposes

before the expiration of the original contract, in order to avoid a loss of 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the contract was signed, but it did not mean that the Women's Bank had no intention of renovating. The court immediately advised both parties to reconcile and not to act emotionally again. Lawyer Yuan stated that the tenants had always been willing to reconcile with the Women's Bank and had repeatedly asked celebrities to mediate, but they were rejected. At this point, the court announced that the case would be adjourned and ordered both parties to go out and try to reconcile.

### Students Conspire with Detectives - Committing Assault - Sentenced to Punishment

Zou Zhengzhi, the class president of the third grade of high school at the private Shanghai Middle School on Chengdu Road, usually had disagreements with his classmate Fang Yi. On the morning of September 20, at 10:30 am, he conspired with his former classmates Wang Biqing and Li Boqing, who are now working as detectives for the French Police, to go to the school dormitory and severely beat Fang, causing serious injuries. After the incident, Chief Detective Ding Huaguo of the Xinzha Police Department arrested Zou, Wang, and Li and escorted them to the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention. Now Fang's injuries have gradually healed. Under the interrogation of Judge Fu yesterday morning, Zou Zhengzhi was sentenced to 50 days of detention, and Wang and Li were each sentenced to four months in prison, with a two-year suspended sentence.

### Woman Refuses to Marry - Man Asks for Contract to be Terminated - Court Orders Mediation to No Avail

Wang Hengsen, a mailman from Ningbo working in the Express Mail Department of the Shanghai Postal Administration, also known as Wang Guantao (23 years old, resident of K-33, Xitaihua Lane, Beijiangxi Road), with both parents alive, was introduced by Wang Yiye and Hong Zengzhi and engaged to Mi Weiji, the daughter of Mi Yaozhang, the owner of the Xintaihe Tobacco and Paper Shop at 518 Pushi Road. Mi's daughter is 29 years old, with a beautiful appearance and a secondary education. However, because she was not yet an adult, her parents made the decision to engage her. The wedding date was set for the 14th of this month. However, a rift suddenly appeared between the man and woman, and the woman's father notified the man's house to postpone the wedding, but Wang refused, leading to a dispute. Later, a reconciliation was reached, and it was still allowed to hold the wedding as scheduled. Unexpectedly, as the wedding date approached, the woman's father suddenly notified the man again, asking for a postponement, and temporarily refused to get into the car and enter the door. Wang had no choice but to return in disappointment. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now Wang has filed a petition with the Civil Court of the Special Court No. 2, against Mi Yaozhang and Mi Weiji, father and daughter, requesting the termination of the engagement. The opposing party, through lawyer Shen Zongyong, submitted a defense, opposing the man's request to terminate the engagement. The case was heard by Judge Yu Jian on the morning of the day before yesterday. The opposing party did not arrive, only stating that one party had arrived in court. After briefly stating the reasons for the application, the court ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful.

### Luring and Selling Young Girls into Prostitution - Further Investigation

Zhang You, a woman from Suzhou, is 29 years old and has been running brothels in the Tianjin area of North China. She came to Shanghai in the winter of last year to find beautiful women, spending money to buy Liu Dayuan, a 17-year-old woman from Changshu, and Zhang Heyuan, a 16-year-old woman from Changshu. After the transaction was completed in the Dacheng Apartment on Pushi Road in the French Concession, on December 14 of the same year, Zhang led the two women on the Taikoo Company's Shuntian steamer to Tianjin. Just as they were about to set sail and leave the country, Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongtang, detectives from the China Women and Children Relief Association, together with Wang Songshan, a detective from the Water Police Department, boarded the ship and discovered them. They were detained together and transferred to the French Police Department for escort to the Special Court No. 2 for prosecution in accordance with the law. The initial trial resulted in Zhang being sentenced to one year and six months in prison for intending to profit and luring women under the age of 20 away from their families. During the appeal period, she was allowed to provide a cash guarantee of 1,000 yuan and provide a store guarantee that she would be available whenever summoned. Liu and Zhang were found to have been lured and sold. Their parents were summoned and allowed to take them back. Later, Zhang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court No. 3. The result of the trial was a change in the legal provisions, but the sentence was still one year and six months in prison. Zhang still refused to accept the verdict and filed a third appeal with the Shanghai Special District Court of the Supreme Court, hoping for a further acquittal. The Special Court of the Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and found that the facts of the second trial judgment were still unclear. Therefore, it overturned the original judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. After receiving the judgment and case file, the High Court No. 3 held a collegiate panel for a new trial yesterday afternoon, consisting of President Wu Tingqi and Judges Wang and Chen. Only the appellant Zhang and her defense lawyer arrived. Liu Dayuan, Zhang Heyuan, Liu Chushi, Zhang Huisheng, Yang Yunhua's wife, and Zhang Heyuan's sister, who were summoned as witnesses, did not arrive. After the court questioned Zhang about the reasons for the appeal, it summoned the investigating detective Chen Shaoting and others for questioning. Because the facts of the case still need to be investigated, it was decided to postpone the trial and question them again at a later date. Zhang still paid the original guarantee.

### Case of Intimidating Bank Employees - Both Parties Convicted - Each Sentenced to Two Months in Prison with a Two-Year Suspended Sentence

Zhang Lingyun, a Suzhou employee of the Yongcheng Silver Company at 241 Room, Central Exchange Building, on Edward Road, who used high-interest rates to exploit people, previously hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Court No. 2, accusing Bi Haomin, the owner of the Bidexing Raincoat Company at 35 Rue Massenet, of using a pistol to forcibly intimidate him. However, Bi claimed that he only had a dispute with Zhang over housing matters at the time and there was no intimidation, so he also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The case has been concluded by Judge Wu, and the judgment was announced yesterday. Bi Haomin was found guilty of interfering with personal freedom and sentenced to two months of imprisonment. If a fine is paid in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at three yuan per day, with a two-year suspended sentence. Zhang Lingyun was found guilty of false accusation and sentenced to two months of imprisonment, with a two-year suspended sentence.

On the 25th, at about 1 PM, while passing through Zhangjiazhai in Pudong, he was suddenly accosted by two robbers who brandished guns to intimidate him. As a result, he was robbed of one yuan in legal tender. However, Gu, unwilling to part with even one yuan, shouted for help as the robbers fled. One of the robbers turned around and fired a shot at Gu, the bullet hitting his right waist and exiting his left waist, causing severe injury. Afterwards, he was brought to Shanghai and admitted to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, his life hanging by a thread.

### YMCA Announces Vocational Introduction Registration – Daily from 9 AM to 12 PM – Register at the YMCA on Sichuan Road

The Shanghai YMCA has always considered serving young people as its responsibility. In recent years, the number of young people who have dropped out of school and are unemployed has increased dramatically. The YMCA has done its best to provide relief, with remarkable results. Currently, the cost of living in Shanghai is extremely high, and the number of unemployed people is greater than ever before. Among them are those with specialized skills, but without an introduction, they feel there is nowhere to be employed. On the other hand, there is a demand for talent, but there is no place to recruit it. The YMCA used to have a vocational introduction department, but it was suspended due to certain reasons. Now, in order to match supply and demand and reduce unemployment panic, the YMCA has reopened the vocational introduction registration at its Sichuan Road location, with registration hours set from 9 AM to 12 PM daily, which is truly good news for the unemployed.

### Patricide Case – Written Justification for Judgment – Zhou Jing and Her Two Sons Will Appeal

The sensational patricide case has been judged by Judge Fu Lin of the First Special Court. The two sons, Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxang, were sentenced to death for jointly murdering a lineal ascendant relative, deprived of their civil rights for life. Their mother, Zhou Jing, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for assisting in damaging the body. All details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Zhou Jing, Zhou Qinji, and Zhou Qinxang are dissatisfied with the judgment and have entrusted their agents, lawyers Yang Lizhi, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Sicheng, to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. Zhou Jing's statement of appeal has already been submitted, and the court's judgment has also been sent out separately yesterday. Since the main points and facts in the judgment have already appeared in previous reports, they are omitted here. The reasoning for the judgment is excerpted below. Investigation of the facts of the case is based on the defendants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxang's own admission without denial. They were apprehended on the spot while dismembering the body. The corpse of the deceased, Zhou Yongjie, was examined and verified by the court's prosecutor along with the forensic doctor, confirming that he had been electrocuted to death before dismemberment. Furthermore, one end of the electric wire found was still attached to the deceased's hair. Their description of the murder before and after, the electric wires and saws purchased from various stores, were verified by the police by checking the invoices from those stores submitted to the case, which can serve as corroborating evidence. Therefore, there is no doubt that they jointly killed a lineal ascendant relative and damaged the body in an attempt to cover up their traces. However, damaging the body was a result of the murder, and according to the law, a more severe punishment should be imposed for one of the crimes. According to both defendants, after killing their father, they stole and hid his savings passbook and cash, so the reason for the patricide does not seem to be solely due to the abuse of their mother by their father. Even if they could not bear to see their mother being tortured day by day, they still deliberately and thoughtfully caused him to suffer such a tragic death. After their father died, they were not moved in the slightest and calmly prepared knives and saws to dismember his body. As individuals who have received secondary education, they dared to commit such a heinous act. If they are not given the most severe punishment, it would not be enough to deter others. When Zhou Yongjie was dying, he shouted loudly, so the sound he made must have been different from usual. Zhou Jing was already startled, yet she did not go to check immediately. It was not until she saw the light on in her son's bedroom that she asked what they were doing. Therefore, it cannot be said that she had no knowledge of her son's murder of her father. However, she firmly claimed that she knew nothing beforehand, and the Zhou Qinji brothers also claimed that they had planned the murder in the French Park and only informed their mother afterwards. Since there is no other positive evidence, Zhou Jing cannot be held equally responsible for the crime of murder. However, according to the statements of the Zhou Qinji brothers and the report of the deputy section chief, they later discussed cutting up the body with knives. Zhou Jing heard about it in advance and did not stop them. When they were carrying out the act, she also carried the key to the balcony door and restrained the maid in the kitchen downstairs. Therefore, her intention to assist in dismembering the body and her actions beyond dismemberment are undeniable. The charging article of law should be changed to consider her as an accessory to damaging the body. Even if she could not bear to expose her son's crimes, she did not think of her marital bond and allowed her husband to suffer the tragedy of dismemberment, which is also unforgivable. However, she is an accomplice and should have her punishment reduced by one-third of the principal offender's sentence. Summarizing the above conclusions, based on Article 291 (first paragraph) of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 272 (first paragraph), Article 247 (first paragraph), Article 28, Article 55, Article 30, Article 66 (first paragraph), Article 16, Article 37 (first paragraph), and Article 38 (first paragraph, item 2) of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.

### Burning Incense and Kneeling in Reverence - Foreman Dies Strangely

According to Shewen News Agency, Jiang Mashou, a 45-year-old native of Nantong residing at No. 26, Lane 147, Aierkaoke Road, Public Concession, was usually a foreman. Yesterday morning at around 7 AM, Jiang got up and, as he enjoyed reciting scriptures and worshiping Buddha, followed his usual practice of lighting incense and candles in his living room and bowing reverently. Unexpectedly, while worshiping, he suddenly collapsed to the ground and did not get up. After a long time, his family noticed that he was lying stiffly on the ground, barely breathing. They urgently called for a car and sent him to Hudong Hospital, but Jiang had already died on the way. The cause of death in this case is strange, and the police are currently investigating.

### Priority

— Peichu

The fundamental and the superficial, priority and sequence, are all things we should understand. Understanding them "is close to the Way," although the definition of this "Way" is difficult to determine. For now, let's not discuss the fundamental and the superficial, but talk about priority.

In fact, priority is just a method of handling affairs. On a small scale, for example, in personal life, there are things that should be done first and things that should be done later. If the order is reversed, our affairs will not succeed. On a large scale, as for national affairs, it is indeed necessary to carefully determine priorities and proceed step by step, neither skipping levels nor procrastinating.

However, if it is a large-scale matter, such as resisting Japan and saving the country, with thousands of threads to untangle, it is certainly necessary to sort out a priority, and within the priorities, it is necessary to sort out the first priority, which requires us to think even more carefully. The reason for thinking, of course, is precisely in relation to each person's environment and the circumstances of the time and place. So, for us people on the isolated island, what exactly is our top priority?

I believe that our first priority now is to collect and donate winter clothing. As for the reasons why, I don't think it's necessary for me to elaborate on them here. The weather is already cold, and soon it will be very cold. We are wearing warm clothes, shouldn't we consider those who have no winter clothing?

It is already obvious that things within the same scope should be distinguished by their priority, and for things in two or more different scopes, I believe we should also compare their priority. For example, between personal and group matters, we should prioritize group matters, and between group and national matters, we should prioritize national matters, which is also beyond dispute. Such comparisons may indeed come before distinguishing things within the same scope.

The so-called priority, to put it bluntly, is just asking us to look at the importance of the matter and ourselves. The important should come first, and ourselves can be put later. Let each of us ask ourselves, are we putting ourselves first or the priority first? I am willing to risk being seen as "a broken record" and ask everyone to reflect. (Move for donations of winter clothing.)

### Deserted City

— Shi Weisi

Bamboo leaves float in groups in the stream towards the distant evening colors, like light boats on a distant expedition. In my pupils is a scene of autumn mountains by an ancient ferry at sunset. I feel lighter than a swallow, wanting to chase the white clouds in the sky with a stroke of the setting sun. I begin my fantasy.

Fantasy is more appropriately said to be a reproduction of my own footsteps, towards a deserted city, standing alone by an ancient ferry. Yes, leaping over ten thousand mountain peaks, the complaints of the grass under my feet gradually subside. I am familiar with this road. That crumbling wall, that ruined ruin, that expanse of black tiles and red walls, the towering three gates... Sailing in a small boat through the golden ripples in the setting sun, I glimpse the bamboo curtain hiding a low building. Although it is already sealed with spider silk, on the desolate gray wall, should there still be a dark shadow left behind, filled with melancholy?

The memory will be clearer. Two months of loneliness like days in a tomb passage! Mornings have rooster crows, and nights have the wind sending distant cold watches to the small building. Outside the window, the great mountains and rivers are not seen by an elder leaning on a cane, smiling gently in the wind on the plank bridge. Everywhere is just the trace of sparrow chirps. The small door is blocked by the bamboo forest, singing rustling songs, which feels colder than the gurgling water under the bridge. My young heart of twenty years old seems to have transformed into a thin old man sweeping fallen leaves against the autumn wind. One broom after another, it can't be swept clean. One night of autumn wind, and the steps and windowsills are full again.

I am willing to linger in this world. I love the slanting wind and fine rain, facing a green lamp, with a melancholy shadow. What should be remembered are the fish in the pond, competing for the rice sprinkled in hand under the tired sunlight, the carved railings on the pavilions in the old garden, more than ten years ago, passing through one rockery after another, catching the old dream of asking Aunt for impatiens... Sometimes I really want to paint a picture of the dozens of fishermen on the other side of the stream, wearing bamboo hats and holding fishing rods, making ingenious tricks. A large part of humanity is born to be decorations in paintings. Imagining the brave act of carrying a hunting gun and torch to climb the mountains and forests, the thrilling sledding that leaps onto the ice mountains in the snow, rushing into the water in summer and swimming from one end of the Yangtze River to the other... etc., and fishing. (Those things, once in my own hands, make me completely clumsy.) However, I am not like the maiden in the boudoir, looking at the willows at the edge of the road, longing for the soldier! That painting seems too delicate. I have indeed spent mornings and mornings alone by the window. I want to paint that plank bridge, the people appear so humble, and it's not clear whose faces they are.

A friend said: Another month like that, and your irritable and sensitive heart will become a little gentler, a little calmer!

But I say, I miss another deserted city even more! Another deserted city, yes, carrying a baggage alone, walking slowly in the desert sea, suddenly a strange wind comes from the horizon, and the body rolls with the yellow sand. When it stops, my baggage and all my wealth for survival in the baggage are gone! Only a clear stream is seen, and I see my own strange shadow in the clear stream. I get up and walk, disregarding the fatigue of my feet, and then I arrive at another deserted city. In the deserted city, besides the footsteps of a wandering traveler, not a living soul is seen, not a wisp of smoke is seen. Now, open your ancient books and see that in the lines eaten by bookworms, there is a passage: The An Lushan Rebellion, or the massacre by the White Lotus Sect, when the soldiers arrive at a place, not a man, woman, or child escapes. After the slaughter is over, they leave, and then for hundreds of years, or decades, a deserted city remains. That is this deserted city! The ground and grass still flow with the blood of the Middle Ages, and there are ancient heads in the ruined walls and tiles. I walk alone as if returning to a medieval country, following the footprints of strange birds and butterflies! I tell you, in that other deserted city, I established another world with my bare hands, a double bunker, a tall building!

Writing this, I still do not forget that this is just a fantasy. Facing the green lamp, spreading out white paper, I suddenly despair of my fantasy being too naive! I should unravel his dream like a warrior with practice, and transform it into a greater joy. But in reality, even looking at the clear stream and watching the bamboo leaves flow towards the distant evening mountains, it should be said to be too neurotic. I seem to have one foot on a light boat, floating, and the other foot is stabbed in the grass by insects, causing heartache.

### Literary Men and Poverty

— Muchang

It seems that literary men have always been inextricably linked to poverty since ancient times.

In the long process of historical labor, after the separation of mental labor and muscle labor, it lost its significance of production; and literary men, the mental laborers, later became even more distant from farmers, workers, craftsmen, and even factory owners, landlords, and merchants in all forms of life. Their skills have never been enough to cope with "carrying loads" or "collecting taxes," and they, as middle layers, always have the tragic fate of being poor. Of course, the few literary men from wealthy families are another matter.

Sima Xiangru wearing a loincloth seemed to be a great shame for literary men, but shouting loudly: "Get a bowl of original flavor, please" was more active than secretly writing the Fengshan essay at home, which might as well be a self-mockery.

Of course, truly relying on the "nature" of literary men is not enough to dazzle the world. It is indeed true that in modern times, when the concrete crystallization of mental labor (?)—writing—has become a commodity, literary men cannot raise their heads to breathe a sigh of relief; even if articles have market prices that can be immediately dumped on the market, the hands often write themselves off, let alone the fact that they may not necessarily be so. Some "climbing the dragon" often happens outside of writing, which is a common lament throughout ancient and modern times.

Therefore, some literary men of the older generation often warn young people: Being a literary man is too hard, too hard! The meaning between the lines seems to want Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie to disband their group, holding their alms bowls and begging for alms, and stop reciting scriptures. But this warning of "no through road" only makes those with ambitions lose some courage. There are not few people in the world who cannot be literary men but insist on being so, knowing that they will be stained with poverty and not have enough to enjoy for a lifetime, so why write books for "literary youth"?

So someone cleverly pointed out "side occupations" to make up for it: those who write articles come to teach, those who teach come to pull carts... the former are still literary men, but the latter provide material for newspaper reporters. But poverty is still poverty.

Some literary men who want to make up for poverty inevitably want to find a wonderful side occupation. For example: "Playing ball." They use their skilled mental labor to calculate what angle the ball should be at and how to hit it well. However, applying it to writing may result in good articles, but on the field, it's always a bit "that," and most of it is not a large "capital." (?) As a result, they naturally fall short. Dostoevsky is still a poor man, letting the landlady give him cold sarcasm.

Perhaps there is a strong desire to "befriend" big merchants, but first they must pass the difficulty of "blushing and turning red," and must understand more about "market conditions."

It is natural that "wonderful" paths are blocked, so some want to "change careers" thoroughly—what if they don't take this road? A father said to his son who wants to be a writer: "You have to be a politician to succeed!" This is quite straightforward. But some kind of seed seems not to be able to be cultivated. Some people get upset when they hear the sound of abacuses or computers, so they just give up.

In fact, looking at the entire social structure: "fiddling with the abacus" is not more meaningful than "wielding the pen," although the latter is not necessarily beneficial. Literary men sometimes caress their own works, feeling a vague comfort, which is a reward, but not all of it. Even for the likes of Liu Yong, who are romantic by nature, and where there is well water, there are lyrics, which may not be enjoyable, let alone that Karl is enough to explain the world with the crystallization of his labor. But the regret is that the calligraphies were cheated away by salt merchants, and hanging in people's living rooms has always been used to prop up their faces, which is also something that those who are "hard to be confused" can't help. The problem is: calligraphy does not express anything, it is just for elegant enjoyment.

Literary men are poor, but there are those who are even poorer; if they sigh for poverty, do they want to get rich suddenly—which is a sign of decline.

We ask ourselves: Is our faith firm? - Naturally, "talking coolly," believing in "gold yuan" makes them no longer poor. Similarly, is life regular? - But only hiding in the "study" to find words and pick sentences, deliberately weaving, distorting, only sees his own mental labor, but a leisure (money) play.

"Scholars starve to death is a common thing." Today's literary men are naturally not as stupid as before, but there are absolutely opposite paths: one is: tempering their muscles and bones (five cents per thousand words is fine, one cent per day for living expenses still has to climb mountains, what is there to be afraid of); otherwise, the other is: selling their souls.

Under the War of Resistance, literary men are even clearer in their faces: the gray ones are still..., poor?

### Luo Jingyu Takes "Paradise in the Isolated Island" to Chongqing to Screen for Chairman Chiang

— Cuiping

Proposing Three Requirements to Resolve the Aftermath

Luo Jingyu, the technical section chief of the Chongqing National China Film Studio, came to Hong Kong this spring to rent the photography studio of Qiming Film Company, created the Dadi Film Company, and hired famous directors such as Cai Chusheng, Situ Huimin, and Tan Youliu to produce national defense films as a banner. When it was first established, the outside world suspected that Dadi was a Hong Kong branch of the China Film Studio, but in fact, all capital was raised by Luo personally, and it was independently operated, except that some machinery was borrowed from the Chongqing China Film Studio. The first decision was to produce "Paradise in the Isolated Island," directed by Cai Chusheng, written by Zhao Yingcai, and jointly starred by Li Lili, Li Qing, and members of the China Art Troupe. The film took four months of work time and cost HK$40,000 to complete. The film has been screened in Hong Kong, and although the business record is higher than ordinary domestic films, it is still at risk of loss due to the excessive cost. It is estimated that "Paradise in the Isolated Island" could be completed with HK$15,000, but unexpectedly exceeded the budget by more than double. Therefore, after the completion of this film, Dadi Company's economy also fell into a very difficult situation, and the second film "White Clouds Hometown" had to be temporarily suspended, because the current income of "Paradise in the Isolated Island" must first be used to pay off creditors. Luo Jingyu plans to take the film to Chongqing and screen it for Chairman Chiang. If Chairman Chiang is satisfied after watching the film, and it is effective for anti-Japanese propaganda, then please Chairman Chiang exceptionally allow the income from the screening of "Paradise in the Isolated Island" in various provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan to be used to buy foreign exchange and send it to Hong Kong, as funding for Dadi Company to continue filming, or please Chairman Chiang provide the company with a certain amount of regular expenses on a monthly basis, or move Dadi Company to Kunming. Luo Jingyu has taken the film to Chongqing for one of these requests to be approved by Chairman Chiang, so how the filming work of Dadi will proceed in the future will not be decided until Luo returns to Hong Kong.

### Chatting about Wang Qingchen

— Liu Zhengku

The Xindu Theater, which has been preparing for a long time, has not yet opened. Once there were rumors that Jin Suqin, Lin Shusen, and Zhang Yipeng would form a troupe, but it ended up as a pipe dream. Now it has become a reality after brewing, and the internal organization is ready. It is planned to officially open on the first day of next month. The recruited famous actors are all the best of the time. It is heard that the internal cast includes female lead Yu Sulan, scholar-warrior leading man Yang Ruiting, leading man Wang Qingchen, and warrior Zhao Songqiao, etc. At that time, we will be able to refresh our eyes and ears. However, Qingchen has been away from Shanghai for a long time, and I am afraid that the opera lovers in Shanghai have felt unfamiliar with him, so I record a brief account of him as follows:

According to Qingchen, he graduated from Jinling University and was one of the earliest amateurs to go into the opera business. He loves Peking opera and has been immersed in it for a long time. He has a deep understanding of Tan school operas. He is now 48 years old. He first studied martial arts actors, then sang leading man roles. He apprenticed to veteran opera singer Rui Debao, and he is particularly good at helmet and armor plays. Twenty years ago, he once succeeded Xiao Yu in performing at the Yitai Theater (stage owner Shen Shaoan, also known as Monk) and the First Stage (stage owner Yun Hongqing), and he was well received at that time. Later, he went north to seek further education and studied with the famous amateur Wang Junzhi. Junzhi valued his talent and accepted him as a disciple, and he taught him everything about the Tan style, word by word and note by note. He also humbly learned privately from Xiao Yu, and he was almost indistinguishable. For a period of time, he paired with Xiao Yun, which helped him a lot. In recent years, his art has become more refined, and his singing and acting have become more pure. He has performed in Tianjin and other places, and he is well known wherever he goes. This time, he came to Shanghai to avoid the war. Through the introduction of Liu Binkun, he joined Xindu to cooperate with Ruiting. It can be called a beautiful combination, and it will be able to compete with Baosen and Shaolin.

### Recent Events in the Arts

Miss Wang Xichun has recently risen to prominence on the silver screen, starring in "The Twenty-Second Episode of Wen Suchen," which has been filmed and test-screened with great success. The Universal Company is now filming the stage play "Consort Xiang's Regret" as a movie and has rehired her for the leading role. It is also reported that she started filming at the China United Film Studio the day before yesterday.

The young and famous opera singer Mr. Gu Zhenxiang is renowned among contemporary performers for specializing in young male roles, achieving momentary fame. He performs the pheasant-feather-crowned student with elegance and grace, his voice and appearance both excellent. His skill is considered comparable to that of Yu Zhenfei. The Xian Ni Society Kun opera troupe, recently affiliated with "Da Luo Tian," has invited him as a guest performer. Tonight (the 28th), he will take the stage to try out the play "First Practice of Selling Horses." His co-star will be the famous Dan actress Zhu Chuanming. Their collaboration will be a perfect match and is expected to be highly entertaining.

Miss Gu Lanjun is now going to star in a color film. The script is titled "Happy Rivals," and is being produced with funding from cinematographer Yan Heming. Li Pingqian has been hired as the director, and Sun Min and Liu Qiong will play the male leads. It is said that this color film is being shot using "Kodak" special film stock. After filming, it will be transported to the United States for development by airmail. The cost of sending it by airplane is very high, and this is an initial attempt. Only four-tenths of the color film has been shot so far, so it is not yet entirely in color.

The Xinhua Company also plans to film Miss Chen Yunshang's fourth work, "Sakyamuni," as a color film. They are collaborating with a German technician on the method, and negotiations are currently underway, making realization quite possible. (Silver Silk)

### Shadows of the Dance World

— Xiao Tian (47)

Going to Hong Kong

Going to Hong Kong, perhaps, some dancers who have gone to Hong Kong have returned fully loaded. Two days ago, a friend of mine nicknamed Wang Bo received a letter from Hong Kong from a dancer named Fang Lili, which was forwarded from here. In her letter, she said that business in Hong Kong dance halls is now even more sluggish, while prices are several times higher than before. Logically, now that foreign exchange is slightly looser than before, prices should not continue to rise. As for the sluggish dance market, it is probably due to the return of the group of Shanghai residents who had been living there.

The Metropolitan dancers Shu Yunlan and Shu Yunzhu will both leave for Hong Kong on the 31st of this month. Their motive for going to Hong Kong has been brewing for a long time, and it has only now come to fruition, but it is a bit late. People have been giving them farewell dinners these days, and I have tagged along as a guest a few times. They told me that they will stay there for three months this time, and their mothers are going with them. The dance hall will provide travel expenses and accommodation, and the salary is still under consideration. Because if they want to receive a salary, the corresponding condition is to sell a certain number of dance tickets.

They are both underage children. Yunzhu is truly innocent and carefree. She said, "When I get to Hong Kong, the first letter I write will definitely be to you." I asked her if she knew how to write it? She took a pencil and a small notebook from her purse and started writing. She wouldn't let me watch while she wrote, and only handed it to me after she finished. I found it very cute, and I couldn't help but smile. She wrote, "To Master's feet, with respect. Having bid farewell to your esteemed countenance, I am overwhelmed with longing..." I said, "You must have studied in school for a few years. Did you copy this from a textbook? But you used the phrase 'at your feet' incorrectly. These words can only be used for your parents." She said, "Isn't Master the same as my father? Why can't I use it? What should I use for Master?" I thought this child was very good, and it's a pity she's learning to be a dancer. I told her a little about the meaning of "at your feet" and cited the story of Lao Laizi wearing colorful clothes to please his parents. She was very perceptive, but I don't think she could understand the meaning of "to the honored desk of the master," so I only taught her to write "to the respected presence of Master" and a few common idioms used in letters. After dinner, I went to the Metropolitan and saw her often drawing on paper with a pencil in her spare time while accompanying dances. I thought, why do so many children with the money to go to school often skip class?

### Extracurricular Chronicles of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

At this time, Xijiao has already been killed by Third Master Song, severing their relationship and breaking their vows. How could he possibly reward Mother Yan with a tael of gold worth three hundred taels of silver? That's why I dare to judge that it must be another ten taels of silver. Don't think that many opera singers who often perform this play, if they don't carefully study the plot or only know what is supposed to happen without knowing why, I think they will certainly mistake the ten taels of silver used to buy a coffin for Mother Yan as the tael of gold just taken from Xijiao's corpse. Since we are determined to study drama, we cannot ignore these small details.

### The Strange Cases of Killing a Son for Revenge and Killing a Father

"Killing a Son for Revenge" is also known as "The Strange Case of Nantong." This play once caused a sensation. Later, officials banned the play because the first part involved obscenity and was harmful to social morals. Moreover, this play was not particularly exciting in terms of performance. Most of the performers were female performers who could only perform small eight-part plays with female roles. Famous male actors disdained to perform it. In recent years, however, female Dan actors such as Xue Yanqin and Xin Yanqiu have strived to reach higher levels, and their skills are comparable to those of male actors. Even if officials do not stop it, Dan actors will certainly not want to use this play to attract customers.

According to the plot of the play, a mother kills her son and chops his body into eight pieces, placing them in a basket. This is extremely cruel. However, unexpectedly, many years later, a rebellious case of a son killing his father occurred in Shanghai. After the killing, he also used dismemberment methods, preparing to put the body in a box to try to cover up the traces. Looking at these two cases, they seem to be distantly related. The most incomprehensible thing is that both events occurred in Jiangsu Province, which is known for its culture and education. Nantong is known as a model county, and Shanghai is a special area where culture gathers and both Chinese and foreigners pay attention. Nantong is not far away. Now, such cruel and violent things have happened one after another. This must also be attributed to the poor quality of our country's education and the gradual decline of old morality, which has led to this. (129)
