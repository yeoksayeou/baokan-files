### Germany Replies to Britain, Still Insisting on Territorial Demands on Poland, Sacrificing Sovereignty is Unacceptable to Poland, but the Door to Diplomatic Negotiations Remains Open

(Berlin) Hitler's reply to Britain was delivered to Henderson last night. The question of war or peace in Europe will soon be decided. The German reply was personally handed to Henderson by Hitler at the Chancellery at 7:15 PM last night. Hitler and Henderson then held a 25-minute discussion. After Henderson left, Hitler received the Italian Ambassador, with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also present. After Hitler's reply was sent, the Nazi Party expressed considerable optimism about the situation, believing that Hitler was willing to resolve the German-Polish dispute peacefully. However, they still consider the situation to be extremely serious. Hitler considered the reply to Britain until late the night before, sleeping for only a few hours. He then dictated the content of the reply into a recording machine, which was transcribed by his female secretary, and then revised by Hitler himself. The German Ambassador to Italy will return to Berlin within a few days to report on his duties. (30th Associated Press)

(London) Authoritative sources here announced last night that the talks between Prime Minister Hitler and the British Ambassador to Germany on Sunday did not reveal any encouragement for a peaceful resolution of the Polish-German dispute. Prime Minister Hitler reiterated Germany's assurance of friendship to Britain, but he more firmly presented his demands on Poland. An official of the responsible diplomatic authority stated that Prime Minister Hitler formally demanded the return of Upper Silesia, Danzig, and the Polish Corridor to Germany. This demand includes one-third of Polish territory. (30th Associated Press)

(London) According to reliable sources here today, Hitler's reply to Chamberlain demanded that Poland send representatives to Germany for negotiations within 24 hours. The condition was that Poland agree to hand over Danzig and the Polish Corridor to Germany before the negotiations. The time limit was midnight tonight. According to Henderson, Hitler's reply was no different from a "letter of resignation." (30th Associated Press)

(Warsaw) Polish political circles today received news that Hitler demanded that Poland hand over Danzig and the Corridor before negotiations even began. They immediately stated that Hitler's demands were absolutely unacceptable. This demand is a blatant disregard for Polish sovereignty. (30th Associated Press)

(Berlin) According to well-informed sources, the German reply to Britain this time seems to be longer than the letter from Head of State Hitler to French Premier Daladier. Although it reviews the current situation from all aspects, in essence, all possible avenues remain open. However, direct negotiations between Germany and Poland are not possible. (29th Havas)

(Berlin) Political figures here say that the possibility of negotiations still exists, but Germany's attitude towards general issues has not changed. The demands regarding Danzig and the Corridor are not open to further discussion. The "Berlin Evening News" stated, "The city of Danzig and the Corridor have already expressed their allegiance to Germany. This can be seen by observing the local situation. Britain and France must not use other reasons to evade these facts." The "Hamburg Local Daily" published an editorial stating, "The exchange of official documents between Britain and Germany is to explore the root causes of the current crisis. The lofty ideal of reorganizing world peace based on British-German cooperation has been undermined by Britain's change of political policy in March of this year, adopting an anti-German stance. Since then, Britain has refused to acknowledge that to build a new Europe, the Treaty of Versailles must be overturned. Therefore, Head of State Hitler's goal of conducting negotiations to correct the mistakes of 1919 has not been realized. The greatest wound that Germany has suffered since the war is Danzig and the Corridor. This wound hinders Germany's belief in adjusting peace. Only after the wound is healed can the European situation show a bright future." (30th Reuter)

(London) A German plane arrived from Berlin at Heston Aerodrome in the suburbs this morning. It is impossible to know who the passengers were. The Air Ministry and the German Embassy both said they knew nothing about it. (30th Havas)

(London) The British government's reply to Hitler is expected to be sent to Berlin today. The content of the reply is designed to ensure that Hitler does not cease sending documents to the British government. (30th Reuters)

(London) The Times stated that the key to German relations lies in Germany completely abandoning the method of using threats of force in its dealings with other countries. Therefore, Germany's method of dealing with Poland is a test of whether Germany is prepared to conduct negotiations with other countries using methods that can establish international agreements. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that no country welcomes peace more enthusiastically than Britain, but Britain will never allow Hitler to do as he pleases in Poland. (30th Reuters)

(Berlin) According to the German News Agency, Hitler, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, received Ambassador Henderson at 6:15 PM last night and presented him with Hitler's reply to the British government's note. It is expected that this reply will be carried to London by a secretary of the British Ambassador on a special plane. It is reported that Hitler carefully considered Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons before completing this reply. It is reported that the content of this reply is quite detailed. The German original was handed to Henderson last night. Henderson went to see Hitler alone, and Hitler made oral explanations on points not included in the reply. The "Essen National Daily" published a commentary on this matter, saying, "The Head of State is still ready to study various reasonable proposals at any time and is constantly striving to achieve a necessary solution. This attitude can be a model for any politician in the world. However, the continuation of British-German diplomatic talks cannot ease the tension of the situation. It can only be eased after Germany's just demands are met." (30th Reuters)

### British Cabinet Carefully Studies German Reply, Downing Street Diplomatic Activities

(London) Hitler's reply was delivered to the British Foreign Office late last night. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately studied it for an hour and a half. A cabinet meeting was held at 10:30 this morning to discuss it and adjourned at 11:55. (30th Reuters)

(London) There were no significant developments in the situation this morning. However, the British Cabinet held an important meeting at 10:30 AM to study Hitler's reply. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax discussed the German reply late into the night and deliberated for a long time, Chamberlain still took his usual walk in St. James's Park at 9:30 this morning before returning to 10 Downing Street. Before the Cabinet meeting, he met with several cabinet members. French Ambassador Corbin went to the British Foreign Office before noon. (30th Reuters)

(London) The British Cabinet met this morning to discuss two matters: conveying Hitler's reply to the governments of Poland and other countries, and Britain's further response to Hitler. The meeting adjourned at 11:55 AM without setting a date for a continued cabinet meeting. Reuters reporters learned that this was probably because it was necessary to consult with other governments, so no date was set for the cabinet meeting. It was also learned that the content of the German reply to Britain was telegraphed to British Ambassador to Warsaw Kennard this morning to convey it to Polish Foreign Minister Beck. (30th Reuters)

(London) The Foreign Office was extremely active this morning. French Ambassador Corbin was the first to arrive at the Foreign Office and held talks for 40 minutes. He was immediately informed of the content of the German government's reply. Romanian Minister Tilea, Dutch Minister Wovwen, and Brazilian Ambassador Zhenlifanla also arrived at the Foreign Office one after another. (30th Havas)

(London) Sources close to the government here recently stated that when the British reply to Germany first reached Berlin, the reaction was quite unfavorable. In addition to demanding the return of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, Germany also made further demands. At that time, the hope of saving peace was quite weak. It is hoped that the German government will change its mind. In addition, there are various existing factors, such as (1) the Soviet Union has delayed ratifying the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty; (2) former French Chief of Staff General Weygand has been ordered to go to the Near East; (3) Japan and Spain are increasingly alienated from Germany; (4) Germany's attempt to use Hungary as a base for attacking Poland does not seem to be accepted by Hungary. All of these factors are enough to bring some comfort to the general public. (29th Havas)

### Prescribing the Right Medicine to Cure the Chronic Illness, Italian Prime Minister Expresses Views

(Rome) The Italian People's Daily (Mussolini's mouthpiece) stated today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is currently focusing on finding a solution to the Danzig problem, but feels that solving this problem alone cannot appease Europe. According to Mussolini's view, what is needed now is a comprehensive solution, and all pending issues should be resolved. (30th Reuters)

(Rome) The Italian People's Daily recently commented on the current situation, stating that at this time of worldwide crisis, the world is calling on Prime Minister Mussolini to come forward and save peace. But what is meant by peace is unknown. Perhaps this is not like a temporary pain reliever, merely seeking to muddle through without considering the recurrence of chronic illnesses. Indeed, all the sources of Europe's illnesses come from the Treaty of Versailles. If there were no such treaty, all illnesses could be cured immediately. This is a clear matter of reason. (30th Havas)

(Rome) The government authorities have already taken various air defense measures, and blackout regulations have been implemented. It is generally advising people to leave Rome and major cities. All private cars will be prohibited from driving starting on the 3rd of next month. The food supplied by restaurants across the country is also restricted. The general public is quite anxious, believing that the situation is extremely critical and that the government is about to make an important decision. Fascist Party members say that European countries have successively closed their borders, but negotiations are still underway, so there is still hope for a peaceful resolution of the current crisis. (29th Havas)

### Attempted Invasion of Du Ruan Jing Gen Failed, Japanese Troops Have Retreated to Jiangmen, Chinese Troops in Tingbei Won Victory in Attacking Taolin, Japanese and Puppet Troops on the South Bank of the Xiu River Suffered Setbacks, Contested Battle Unfolded in the Suburbs of Changzhi

(Zhaoqing) The Japanese troops who invaded Du Ruan Jing Gen were bravely countered by the Chinese troops and retreated to Jiangmen. On the evening of the 29th, more than 300 Japanese troops again invaded the Daijingtou and Tangxia area from Jiangmen. The Chinese defenders gave them a heavy blow, and they are still in a stalemate in the Huangcun area. (30th Telegraph)

(Wengyuan) More than 100 Japanese troops from Baishi in Dongguan invaded Yulan on the morning of the 29th. The Chinese side has dispatched troops to intercept them. (29th Telegraph)

(Miluo) The Chinese troops in northern Hunan attacked Taolin and Zhongfang. On the 30th, the troops advanced to the Majiadong area north of Zhongfang and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. The Chinese troops also suffered considerable casualties. Another advancing Chinese force attacked Pingshuipu between Yuezhou Yanglou on the 26th, killing more than 20 Japanese troops, seizing a rifle, a horse, and capturing a translator officer, Jing Yuyuan, and others. (30th Telegraph)

(Zhangshu) On the morning of the 24th, more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops invaded villages in the Sunjiabu area south of Yangzhou on the south bank of the Xiu River. They were bravely resisted by local people who formed self-organized teams. As a result, the Japanese and puppet troops were repelled, and dozens of Japanese and puppet troops were killed. Currently, people in the occupied areas of northern Jiangxi are voluntarily forming armed guerrilla teams to defend their hometowns and resist the war. (30th Telegraph)

(Zhangshu) More than 300 Japanese troops repeatedly invaded the area west of Chiyouzhuang, north of Gaoan, along Chenjiabian at 11:00 PM on the 28th. After the Chinese Kou troops bravely fought back, the Japanese troops were defeated by the Chinese troops after a fierce battle until dawn on the 29th, and many military supplies were seized. (29th Telegraph)

(Luoyang) The battle for Changzhi City is still going on fiercely. Since the Chinese four-way siege has approached the suburbs of the city, the Japanese troops are panic-stricken and intensifying their defense. They are currently rushing to build fortifications on the east-west line of Xinyicun (southwest of Changzi) in an attempt to hold on to the death. There are still more than 2,000 Japanese troops in Changzi City, with 11 artillery pieces. There are still 7 or 8 Japanese guard units in Daxiaobaotou in the south of the city and in the Shijiao Township Yanglucun area in the west of the city. A certain Chinese unit is stepping up its efforts to eliminate them. At the same time, another unit has advanced from the vicinity of Lianchengzhen (northeast of Gaoping) towards Huguan (east of Changzhi). Moreover, due to recent heavy rains, many roads near Changzhi have been washed away, making it more difficult for the Japanese troops to resupply. It will not be difficult for the Chinese troops to encircle and annihilate them in the short term. (30th Telegraph)

(Luoyang) According to a military officer returning from the front, since the Chinese successively conquered strongholds such as Jincheng and Gaoping in southeastern Shanxi, the Japanese troops have been defeated and fled, with numerous deaths and injuries. Even the wounded soldiers being transported to Houma have reached more than 3,000, and some of them are being transferred to Linfen. Those who are seriously injured and incurable are burned alive en route, and the situation is extremely miserable. (30th Telegraph)

(Fancheng) The Hubei central war situation, with dense clouds but no rain, has not yet unfolded. The Japanese troops entrenched in Yuekou, Qianjiang, and Xiantao are still transferring troops back and forth. The Japanese troops in Zhangjiegang are currently requisitioning more than 200 civilian boats in the Heilu Canal Yuekou area, linking three boats together to prepare to cross the river. (30th Telegraph)

### Japanese Invaded Boyu Mountain, Heavy Casualties

(Xinyu) According to recent Japanese claims, since the 10th, the Japanese troops who invaded Boyu Mountain north of Huajing'an from Tanxi had a total of more than 1,700 infantry and artillery troops and more than 400 cavalry troops. On the 11th, 93 people were killed and 123 were wounded near Boyu Mountain. By the 18th, more than 230 people had been wounded one after another. They are currently withdrawing to the rear for reorganization. This shows the intensity of the battle at that time and the heavy casualties suffered by the Japanese. (30th Telegraph)

### Japanese Troops in Northern Henan Forcibly Conscripting Strong Young Men

(Luoyang) The war situation in northern Henan has been quiet for a long time. In addition to digging the Qin, Zhang, and Wei rivers in an attempt to submerge the Chinese people, the Japanese troops have recently been forcibly conscripting strong young men in various counties, training them, and enlisting them into the Japanese army. On the morning of the 28th, more than 250 Japanese troops from Qinyang and other places raided the 18 Licun east of Baixiang. They were ambushed by the Chinese × troops, and more than 20 Japanese troops were killed or wounded. They fled back the way they came. (30th Telegraph)

### Japanese Troops in Northeastern Changtaiguan Retreating to Yanghe

(Luoyang) More than 500 Japanese soldiers who occupied the Fozudian northeast of Changtaiguan on the 26th were bravely attacked by the Chinese × troops. The Japanese troops were unable to resist and retreated to Yanghe on the 27th. (30th Telegraph)

Editorial

### Peace in British Hands

According to yesterday's telegrams, the tension in Europe has reached its peak. Disputes on the German-Polish border continue to occur; the mobilization of various countries for war is almost complete; the response to calls for peace is extremely weak. At present, only the exchange of official documents between Britain and Germany is considered to be the peace door that has not been completely closed.

Twenty-five years ago, on the eve of the outbreak of the First World War, French President Poincaré asked Britain to clearly express its assistance to France, saying that peace was in British hands; who knew that today, on the verge of another European war, peace is again in British hands. The theme of this German-Polish dispute is Germany's demand for the annexation of Danzig and the Polish Corridor; and Britain has a prior commitment to Poland to assist in resisting aggression, and five days ago signed a military alliance against aggression; therefore, although Germany's target is Poland, Germany's negotiating opponent is Britain. The recent exchange of official documents between Britain and Germany has not been publicly released. Although we can speculate that the main items in between are nothing more than the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues, Germany has repeatedly stated recently that Germany will not allow further discussion on these two issues in principle; then, what exactly are the two countries discussing, despite the trouble of exchanging official documents? If it is not that it has already involved a considerable range; then it is discussing more detailed items than principles!

British and French figures mostly believe that this British-German negotiation will never become a second Munich; in fact, whether this negotiation can jump out of Chamberlain's old path of appeasement is still the question. Judging from Germany's current firm attitude towards Poland, the only way for Britain, apart from forcing Poland to meet Germany's demands in exchange for peace, is to fight alongside Poland to prevent aggression. Then the peace that the Germans believe is in British hands will naturally be shattered without a trace, but whether this kind of peace is worth cherishing is also the question. The peace that we idealize and that the international community is currently striving for is different from the peace in Germany's mind; and it should be a genuine, worldwide, glorious peace. If we cannot strive for a worldwide, glorious peace, not only the consequences of a "Munich"-style peace are a lesson from the past, but even in the current situation, Poland may not be willing to listen to Britain's advice and sacrifice for an inglorious peace. Therefore, the key to peace is indeed in British hands; the determination of the nature and value of peace is also in British hands! The current Britain should abandon the policy of secret negotiations, clearly express a solemn attitude, and reject unfair demands. This is the peace that Britain holds! International evolution has given humanity many lessons. We believe that the British will use the peace in their hands with the most moral, most enlightened, and most solemn attitude?

Each country has its own national policy, and Britain and Germany are naturally no exception: national policy is fixed, but the implementation of national policy, whether real or illusory, each has its own different means. The current tense situation in Europe cannot but be considered tense and dangerous; but no one can determine whether it will become the Second European War. According to yesterday's Moscow telegram, it is rumored that the German Foreign Minister once gave Stalin a guarantee that although Germany is preparing for war, it will ultimately accept a plan to resolve the German-Polish dispute peacefully, which shows that Germany is not necessarily determined to go to war. What's more, the scars of the First European War are still there, so why would Germany be willing to destroy its new construction of more than 20 years in one fell swoop? Because of this, we are also unwilling to hastily determine the responsibility for destroying peace as a criminal iron case for Germany. Just like the resolution of various disputes, it is also necessary to find new standards of justice in order to seek fairness and lasting peace. If the British side can refrain from acting as one party of allied friends and regard itself as the protector of justice, then the peace it holds will surely be more valuable.

### Polish Government Announces General Mobilization Order, German Troops Enter Slovakia, Danzig Implements Rationing System

Warsaw The Polish government announced a general mobilization order this afternoon. (30th Reuters)

Warsaw It is heard that telephone communication between here and Danzig has now been suspended, and it is heard that the people of Danzig are now subject to a rationing system, the same as the Germans in Germany. (30th Reuters)

(Berlin) News from Danzig here: since yesterday, several trains scheduled to go to Danzig have not arrived. It is reported that they were blocked by Poles at the border. The Danzig government has lodged a serious protest with Warsaw. (30th Reuters)

Warsaw News of German violations of the Slovak border is now coming in like snowflakes. A spokesperson said that German soldiers wearing Slovak uniforms have invaded the border, making the situation even more tense. Germany has now completed its mobilization and troop deployment. (30th Reuters)

Warsaw Poland has historically avoided being labeled as a troublemaker. It often avoids openly announcing mobilization. For example, Japan originally planned to announce a fifth-level mobilization yesterday, but temporarily canceled it after being advised by Britain. However, it is now heard that East Prussia has been fully mobilized, and Slovakia has also been completely occupied by German troops. Therefore, Poland is in a situation of being surrounded on three sides. At the same time, Poland's transportation with Lithuania and Romania is also threatened. Therefore, Poland decided today to openly announce mobilization, but it is beautifully called "security measures" instead of "mobilization". (30th Associated Press)

Warsaw General Smigly-Ridz issued a proclamation that was posted in the capital and various places, stating that the government authorities have decided to step up defensive measures militarily, and said, "We will never give up an inch of land, nor will we give up any rights. Anyone who dares to invade our country will be severely punished. In wartime, whether men, women, old or young, we should all become soldiers defending the country." After reading the proclamation, residents of various places were very calm. Air raid trenches have been dug in parks, squares, and open spaces in various places to prevent air raids. Therefore, the wife of Military and Political Minister General Piłsudski, who is already fifty years old, also participated in the trench digging work near her residence. (30th Havas)

Warsaw Pessimism here about peace. Mobilized (to the last person, there are now 1.5 million soldiers mobilized nationwide. Officials announced that several cases of espionage plots have been discovered. A railway bridge in Norway was bombed, and several German suspects have been arrested in Upper Silesia. Polish newspapers say the German-Polish conflict has reached its peak, and war or peace will be decided within hours. The Polish government announced that the work of digging air raid shelters by people in various places is progressing very well. Currently, men, women, and children are participating in this work. German troops are gathering in the central part of the border. Various circles here speculate that the German troops may want to attack the important industrial area of Upper Silesia in one fell swoop. Ten divisions of German mechanized troops and 1,000 tanks are gathered near Marystol on the Polish border. (30th Associated Press)

### German Troops Control Slovakia

Bratislava The Slovak State is entirely under German control. The German government has implemented military administration in the area. President and Prime Minister Tiso has ordered that all horses, vehicles, gasoline, etc. be supplied to the German troops. Anyone who endangers the German troops will be sent to the German military court for military trial. (30th Associated Press)

Bratislava Prime Minister Tiso received a telegram from Slovak immigrants in the United States yesterday, assuring him of their loyalty to the country. The telegram stated that Slovak immigrants in the United States are currently gathered in Chicago to hold a memorial service for the one-year anniversary of the death of Father Linjia, commemorating his achievements and taking the opportunity to express their loyalty to the country. (30th Haitong)

### Official Statement from Warsaw

Warsaw: The official authorities in Warsaw issued a public statement at 1:00 PM, which reads, "Germany has been pursuing a policy of aggression against Poland for several months. This is evident through newspaper and public opinion attacks, threatening statements from authorities, provocative actions along the border, and the concentration of troops near the Polish border. Most recently, Germany has taken various actions within the Free City of Danzig that not only endanger Poland's legitimate rights but also aim to encroach upon Polish territory. Therefore, there is no doubt that Poland is under threat. However, Poland, faced with this situation, is still willing to sincerely accept the efforts of various allied governments and key figures from friendly nations to mediate and facilitate peace. Regrettably, Germany has not only failed to show sympathy but has also moved its troops into Slovakia, a neighboring country of Poland, yesterday. In view of this situation, the Polish government has no choice but to take defensive measures to ensure its safety. As for the policies of the Polish government, they have always been consistent: it has no aggressive ambitions towards any other country and is willing to cooperate with them faithfully. The fact that Polish President Mościcki responded to US President Roosevelt's call for peace is clear evidence of this." (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

### Polish Police Uncover Terrorist Organization

Warsaw: The Polish police authorities have recently uncovered three German terrorist conspiracy organizations. The largest of these was led by Hans Stein, a German of Polish nationality, with three assistants: Brentel, a correspondent for a German news agency stationed in Katowice; Fränzel, the leader of the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) in Bochum, Germany; and Nelig, who was responsible for the numerous terrorist incidents that have occurred in Katowice. Stein has been arrested, and several bombs were found in five of the trunks in his home. The other two organizations were located in Poznan and Łódź, where a large number of pistols, light machine guns, and a significant amount of explosives were seized. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

### Germany Restricts Railway Transportation

(London) According to a broadcast speech by German Transportation Minister Dorpmüller on various German radio stations, railway transportation in Germany will continue to be restricted. Starting today, the railways will not carry any private passengers. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

### Continued Disputes on the German-Polish Border

Warsaw: Several disputes occurred today at the border between Poland and Germany/Slovakia. (1) A squad of German army sentries invaded Polish territory near Yamaripo Kokigevie in the Pomerania province of Germany. Polish border guards immediately opened fire, and the German sentries quickly retreated back into German territory. (2) A group of Germans opened fire on Polish sentries near Biolut and Danarski late on the 27th. (3) Two German sentries invaded Polish territory in the province of Posnania at midnight yesterday. (4) A large group of German soldiers invaded Polish territory near Leipzig late yesterday, destroying civilian houses with hand grenades before being repelled by Polish sentries. (5) A German plane from the Slovakian border twice invaded Polish airspace yesterday afternoon before turning back after being fired upon by Polish border guards with anti-aircraft guns. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

### German Consuls in Two Polish Cities Arrested

Warsaw: After Polish consuls in Marienwerder and Mährisch Ostrau, Germany, were illegally detained by German police, Polish police have arrested the German consuls in Teschen and Lviv and escorted them here in retaliation. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

At 2:30 PM, the Emperor bestowed the imperial rescript appointing him as Prime Minister. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th)

(Tokyo) The official announcement was made on the night of the 29th that Horie Sueo, the secretary of the Privy Council and appraiser of the Administrative Court of the Privy Council, and secretary to the President of the Privy Council, was appointed as Chief Secretary of the Privy Council. (Domei dispatch on the 30th)

### Abe Delivers a Statement

(Tokyo) Prime Minister Abe delivered a statement at 9:05 PM today, the content of which is as follows: "The world is currently in a turbulent state, and the situation is extremely serious. However, establishing a new order in East Asia is Japan's unwavering national policy, and adjusting international relations is also a matter of current importance. Given the complexity of the international situation, Japan will adhere to its independent stance and implement its beliefs autonomously. Countries that understand Japan's position and are willing to cooperate will be regarded as our friendly nations, and we will cooperate together. For countries that do not, we will deal with them with resolute determination. At the same time, domestically, we will renew institutions, strengthen the national defense system, enrich military preparations, and implement rational measures such as expanding production, promoting exports, and controlling the economy to overcome the current difficulties. Japan's policy towards the China Incident remains firm and unwavering. The government intends to work with the people to implement this policy and move towards a glorious goal. In short, the government will implement all kinds of administrative affairs with a clear and open spirit, guide national thought, and hope that all citizens will unite and support the government to complete the established national policy." (Domei dispatch on the 30th)

### Aoki Expresses Political Views

(Tokyo) After the cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Aoki delivered a statement at the Finance Minister's official residence, the main points of which are as follows: "Recently, international relations among major countries in the world have been constantly changing, and Japan's financial economy may also be affected. We believe that Japan's financial and economic policy should be based on dealing with the China Incident and the international situation, and strengthening Japan's national defense economy and other fundamental national power as the fundamental policy. To realize this fundamental policy, it is essential to expand the productive forces of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, utilize funds and materials, and strengthen the national mobilization system. The budget formulation policy for the 15th year of Showa will continue to follow the policy of the previous cabinet, with the aim of achieving the goals of the China Incident and building a new order in East Asia as the central policy." (Domei dispatch on the 13th)

### Japanese Newspapers Offer Little Praise

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers are not giving much praise to the cabinet formed by the new Prime Minister Abe Nobuyuki. The Asahi Shimbun described the new cabinet as "mediocre and lacking vitality," because the Prime Minister has no connection with politics and no contact with the military, having retired three years ago. The only outstanding choice is the new Navy Minister Yoshida Zengo. The new Army Minister, Hata Shunroku, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in Central China, does not represent the progressive elements of the military. It is said that the new cabinet has a strong bureaucratic political nature, with Nagai Ryutaro, a member of the Minseito party, being the only member of a political party. The chairman of the Minseito party does not approve of his appointment as Communications Minister. Japanese newspapers support the Prime Minister's decision to abolish the cabinet system, which seemed to have caused friction among the five ministers and other cabinet members in the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets. At the same time, the newspapers are concerned that, since the "China Incident," the economic and other plans adopted by various administrative ministries have become extremely complex, and they fear that concurrent positions among cabinet members will cause serious difficulties. It is said that the diplomatic community is dissatisfied with the Prime Minister's concurrent position as Foreign Minister, because Japan's diplomatic relations are very delicate and extremely important at this time. Godo Takuo's appointment as Minister of Commerce and Industry may be successful, but his concurrent position as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is questionable, especially when the issues of food and rising prices are urgent, as the views of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are often contradictory on these matters. The newspapers predict that the Finance Minister will follow the policies of his predecessors. The Chugai Commercial News commented on the new cabinet, saying that its policies are still unknown. Now that the plan to strengthen the anti-Comintern axis has been abolished, and Japan is being forced to redefine its diplomacy with Europe, the new cabinet should build a new stove from a completely new perspective in its foreign policy, and the claim that it is relying on foreign countries cannot be approved. The Prime Minister, who also serves as Foreign Minister, should cooperate with foreign countries that sympathize with and understand Japan's mission, "namely, establishing a new order in East Asia," and are willing to cooperate with Japan. The Kokumin Shimbun expressed satisfaction that the cabinet members of the previous cabinet are no longer serving in the new cabinet, but expressed concern about the policies followed by the new cabinet, especially foreign policy. The newspaper mentioned the rumor that Shigemitsu Mamoru, the ambassador to the United Kingdom, will be appointed as Foreign Minister, saying that the goal of Japanese diplomacy must be to break British dominance in East Asia and establish a new order in East Asia. This guiding principle should not be affected by the new international situation caused by the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. The newspaper is quite concerned about the possibility of a reconciliation between the United Kingdom and Japan rumored in Europe and the United States, saying that if the new cabinet compromises with the United Kingdom and hinders the establishment of a new order in East Asia, it would be a national misfortune.

(Tokyo) According to news from here today, the political power of the Abe Cabinet in Japan does not seem to be a problem. The key is whether it can smoothly promote the wartime economic and financial plan. Judging from the personnel selection of the Abe Cabinet, although it cannot be said to be a strong cabinet, there will be no major friction internally. In terms of economy, there will probably be no major changes. In other words, it must still concentrate its efforts in accordance with the original principles to seek the continuation of the war. The financial community welcomes Aoki Kazuo's appointment as Finance Minister, because his financial policies are similar to those of the former Finance Ministers Kaya and Ishiwata. It is said that the important issue of the new Ministry of Finance is the implementation of the new tax plan. (Associated Press dispatch on the 30th)

### A Glimpse of International Public Opinion

(New York) The New York Sun published an editorial today, saying, "The new Japanese cabinet will be isolated until it gains the trust of the United Kingdom and the United States," and said that the new Japanese cabinet will encounter major difficulties because Prime Minister Abe is taking on important political responsibilities in a non-political attitude. Moreover, since German leader Hitler has betrayed Japan by signing the Soviet-German public agreement, the blow to Japan "cannot be compensated by any cabinet." (Associated Press dispatch on the 30th)

(Chongqing) Regarding the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, newspapers here have added lengthy commentaries, and unanimously believe that Japanese diplomacy has reached a dead end. The change of the cabinet is not enough to save the desperate situation. The Central Daily News claimed that the collapse of the Hiranuma cabinet was inevitable, because it publicly aimed to enhance the anti-Comintern pact at the beginning of its formation. Now that Germany and the Soviet Union have signed a treaty, the cabinet must fall. The emergence of this tragedy in Japan is due to the lack of politicians with foresight. The Ta Kung Pao insisted that General Abe's attempt to win over the United Kingdom will inevitably fail, because as long as Japan wants to establish a new order in East Asia, the rights and interests of the United Kingdom and the United States will be destroyed, and the Nine-Power Treaty will be broken one day. The English-language "Chu Pao" stated that it is strange that the first victim of the European crisis was found in Asia, because the evolution of the European situation forced the resignation of the Japanese cabinet. The report pointed out that since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, three short-lived Japanese cabinets have encountered policy failures one after another. If General Abe Nobuyuki does not have a fundamental solution to the Chinese conflict, his failure can be expected. (Haitong dispatch on the 30th)

(Hong Kong) Hong Kong's Chinese newspapers all commented on the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, believing that the collapse of the Hiranuma cabinet was directly affected by the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. In the future, the new cabinet will try to be pro-British in order to compensate for the loss of the anti-Comintern axis, and try to extricate itself from the quagmire of the invasion of China. In conclusion, the Ta Kung Pao said that any major international changes will not affect China's war of resistance against Japan. The change of the Japanese cabinet is naturally not worth paying attention to. No matter who takes office, China will always resist Japan to the end if Japan does not give up its aggression. If Japan does not know repentance, it will not be able to get rid of its deep-seated feet even if it replaces the cabinet hundreds of times. (Dispatch on the 29th)

### Roosevelt Talks Again About the Neutrality Act; The Attitude of Members of Congress

(Washington) Morning newspapers published news that some Republican members of Congress are about to change their attitude towards the current Neutrality Act. President Roosevelt recently told the press that this statement has not been confirmed, but it is claimed that some Republican and Democratic members of Congress who previously voted against amending the Neutrality Act were closely watched by a certain European government, which shows how the attitude of American members of Congress has a profound impact on the international situation. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

(New York) The government has recently taken various measures to protect domestic gas, electricity, and other public utilities in the event of a war in Europe. In addition, national radio broadcasts will also be monitored. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

### The United Kingdom is Prepared for All Eventualities; Determined to Resist Violence; Chamberlain's Strong Statement is Unanimously Supported by All Parties

(London) Today's House of Commons once again had a solemn expression of unity. After listening to Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, the leaders of the Labour Party and the Liberal Party opposition all spoke in support of the government's firm stance in the current crisis. Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Greenwood said, "I would like to say in the most practical terms that aggression must end now. (Cheers) Poland must not follow the countries that have been victims of aggressors into the tomb. Our spirit has not weakened, but has increased. We hope and pray that we can avoid great destruction. If not, the responsibility will be borne by one person. War will not occur unless Hitler is willing to wage war. The Labour Party is determined to defend freedom and maintain law and order to resist those who arbitrarily use force. Our determination, in a nutshell, is that the threat of open aggression should be ended. We are bold and unshakable on this matter. Those who do not respect the quality of words repeatedly agreed upon will be traitors to world peace and freedom."

Liberal Party leader Sinclair rose to speak, saying, "We cannot move from 'crisis to another crisis. This must be stopped. The government should now receive the firm support of Congress and all peace-loving people in Great Britain. Now the final word will be issued by Hitler." Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax spoke in the Upper House, his words being largely the same as those expressed by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the Lower House. Thus, Congress adjourned until Tuesday of next week.

Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today was calm and firm, and it was enough to excite people. The Prime Minister spoke in a warm cheer and said, "The world often says that the English people's determination is slow, but once the English people's will is determined, they will never let it go. Now that peace and war are still uncertain, our determination to adhere to the predetermined course will not be slackened in the slightest." The Prime Minister then praised the extraordinary calmness shown by the entire British people during this period of anticipation. The Prime Minister then mentioned the preparations for national defense, saying that he admitted that the various plans on micro-issuance would cause various inconveniences, but he believed that the people must now unanimously recognize that the needs of the country are now higher than everything else. "We have not yet begun to issue rations here. Britain's air defense is now in a state of immediate action. Ground air defense arrangements have been garrisoned. The standing team of the Royal Air Force has reached wartime strength after adding necessary reserves. Barrage balloon teams have been assigned to their respective defenses. Reconnaissance teams have been stationed in their defensive positions. The alarm system is ready to operate day and night. (Cheers) The defenses of the bay have been fully arranged, and important locations are garrisoned. A large number of troops have been mobilized at home and abroad. This mobilization is part of a pre-planned plan, so the teams should be sent to their respective defenses as soon as possible before the outbreak of war. As soon as local permanent agencies receive notification, they will be able to move schoolchildren, mothers with infants, pregnant mothers, and blind people from densely populated areas to safe locations. Hospitals for the wounded are also being set up. All of this is enough to show that the country is prepared for all eventualities. (Cheers) The Prime Minister's speech lasted sixteen minutes." (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)

Washington: The British government's reply to Germany's note and the latest news from Europe have been carefully studied by people close to the White House and the State Department. It is generally believed that the British and French governments will be able to maintain a calm and firm attitude. The reports in American newspapers that the United Kingdom intends to make concessions to Germany and maintain peace at any cost are influenced by the German propaganda campaign and are not true. In short, the current situation has been clearly expressed by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in his speech in the House of Commons. In other words, the key to peace and war depends entirely on how Germany responds to the British letter. Leader Hitler may agree to continue talks, but this does not mean giving up any of the original goals. It is speculated that the Leader wants to extend the "nerve war," so the current crisis is unlikely to be completely resolved for a while. Germany may seek to establish a temporary compromise solution and wait for an appropriate opportunity to take "offensive" action again. In fact, Britain and France will certainly not allow it to get its wish. In addition, the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet has not yet discussed the ratification of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. The effects of the establishment have disappeared, and this is also quite important. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

### France Striving for Self-Defense; Increased Alertness; Prohibition of Public Gatherings; Foreigners Enlisting in the Army One After Another

(Paris) Reserve soldiers of the French "Blue Card" class have already enlisted. After the "Red Card" class of strong men enlist, the national mobilization will begin to be realized. French Prime Minister Daladier yesterday discussed military defense matters with General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of National Defense. Daladier then met with former Prime Minister Blum, who expressed the support of the Socialist Party members for the government. According to the police authorities, the strength of the party has greatly increased since it separated from the Communists. According to the police authorities, 150 Communist organizations and printing offices in the suburbs of Paris were thoroughly searched, and as a result, 3,000 slogans and 90,000 propaganda pamphlets were seized. The government authorities claimed that all political gatherings would be strictly prohibited in the future. Officials here believe that the government's actions are the result of France's increasingly cordial diplomatic relations with Spain. Also, official inspections of telegrams and telephones have now been slightly relaxed, but inspection work is still ongoing. (Associated Press dispatch on the 30th)

(Paris) The government has issued orders that no public gatherings may be held in the urban area and suburbs. If anyone violates the prohibition and holds meetings in wine shops and coffee shops, they will be closed. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)

(Paris) Foreigners of various nationalities are now enlisting rapidly in the French army to defend France, just as they enlisted in the French army during World War I. The steps to form an American Legion are now underway. It is said that there are 10,000 Americans who have expressed their desire to enlist. Polish residents and Polish Jews in France who participated in the Great War have declared that they intend to serve France on the battlefield. The "French Friends of Hungary Federation" said that most of its members have enlisted to protect France. Hundreds of Italians residing in France have also volunteered to help France in the war. At the same time, the authorities have taken more advanced security plans, such as prohibiting telephone calls abroad and sending encrypted telegrams. Telegrams sent abroad must now obtain a signature, and domestic calls subject to military inspection can only be conducted in French. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

### Soviet Submarine Incident Reinforces Western Border Defenses; German-Soviet Pact Delay in Ratification: A Powerful Factor for Peace

(Moscow) Recently, multiple foreign newspapers, such as the Swiss "Neue Zürcher Zeitung," have repeatedly carried reports claiming that the Soviet military has withdrawn 200,000 to 300,000 troops from the western border and transferred them to the eastern border to strengthen defenses. TASS was previously instructed to declare that the above report was completely inconsistent with the facts. According to relevant sources, the Soviet military believes that the situation in Eastern Europe is serious and unexpected events may occur, and has decided to increase the troop strength of the western border defense forces. (TASS dispatch, 29th)

(Moscow) The Communist Party's organ, Pravda, recently published an article commenting on the international situation, stating that the Soviet Union is deeply aware of the threat of war and is extremely vigilant, and is therefore busy strengthening the Red Army's strength. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

(Moscow) According to news here today, the Soviet Union is putting pressure on Germany to join peace negotiations to resolve the Polish-German crisis. The Soviet Union views the Soviet parliament's delay in ratifying the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact as a threat to Germany, stating that if Germany attacks Poland, the pact will be torn up. Sources here in the Soviet Union claim that if Germany invades Poland in the near future, it will give the Supreme Soviet the opportunity to oppose the ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, thereby nullifying the pact. Moscow's announcement of the Soviet Union's strengthening of its western border garrison is seen as another form of pressure on Germany to oppose aggression and protect Poland and the Balkan Peninsula countries. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

(Washington) After receiving news that the Soviet Supreme Soviet would postpone ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty and other news, official circles here all hope that the Soviet Union will still contribute to limiting aggression. Although relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were extremely shaken when this agreement was signed, current official opinion is that the actual situation is not as bad as imagined. Anti-Soviet movements in American newspapers have inevitably been launched prematurely. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

(Moscow) The Supreme Soviet has not yet submitted the ratification of the German-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty for discussion after yesterday's meeting. Foreigners here believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov originally planned to deliver a speech in the parliament on the day of the treaty's ratification, explaining Soviet foreign policy. The delay in discussing the case shows that the government intends to wait and see how the international situation develops. In other words, the Supreme Soviet's delay in discussing the ratification is actually what the Soviet government wants, and it is by no means accidental. Since the Supreme Soviet's meeting, it unanimously passed the agricultural tax bill today. Tomorrow is a Soviet holiday and the meeting will be adjourned for one day. When the meeting resumes at 1:00 p.m. on the 31st, the new conscription bill will be submitted for discussion. Assuming that this bill can be voted on and passed on a regular day, the ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty will have to wait until at least the first day of next month before it can be discussed. Moreover, the government convened the Supreme Soviet meeting in a hurry, and most of the deputies from the outer provinces were unable to reach the meeting on time yesterday. Therefore, when the Supreme Soviet discussed the agricultural tax bill yesterday, there were many empty seats in the chamber, which looked quite deserted. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Psychological Warfare Enters a New Stage

(Paris) Well-informed sources here recently declared that the current "psychological warfare" in Europe seems to be entering a new stage today. So far, there are no signs of concession to the various demands made by Germany, nor has it agreed to negotiate with Poland first in the hope of implementing its demands. Although the tone of German newspapers has softened slightly and the diplomatic efforts of various related countries can be regarded as good omens, German troops have already concentrated in the state of Slovakia, which is far from the city of Danzig. It can be seen that Danzig has, in fact, already threatened Poland's Upper Silesia province. In addition, most members of Ukrainian nationalist parties in the Carpathian Ukraine province (formerly belonging to Czechoslovakia and now owned by Hungary) are said to have returned to the province with German passports to promote the Greater Ukraine movement (there are many Ukrainians within Poland). All of this proves that the situation is still extremely chaotic. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

### China Cultural and Educational Center to Broadcast to England Today; English Script Drafted; Plea for Firm Stance Against Japan

(Chongqing) According to news here today, the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center here will broadcast to England tomorrow, requesting that England take a firm stance against Japan. The English script for the broadcast has now been drafted, the gist of which is that the arrogant and domineering attitude of Japanese soldiers towards England is entirely the result of England's consistent policy of mildness and weakness towards Japan. The article believes that Chamberlain's claim that England is facing serious threats in Europe and therefore cannot but adopt a policy of appeasement towards Japan in the Far East is completely a pretext to shirk responsibility. England is the most powerful country in the world, and its national strength exceeds the sum of Germany and Italy. At the same time, the United States and France are willing to cooperate and resist aggression, so what is there to fear? Moreover, the United States' announcement of the abolition of the trade treaty with Japan and the Soviet Union's constant attacks on the border of "Manchukuo" are all clear proof that there is no need to fear Japan. However, as of now, the British government has taken no concrete action other than continuing to submit to Japan. It is no wonder that Chamberlain still says that there are no disputes between countries that cannot be resolved peacefully and must resort to force. The Munich Agreement was the result of Chamberlain's appeasement policy. When this agreement was signed, Chamberlain originally hoped to turn hostility into friendship, but has this been successful in reality? The script also stated that Chamberlain, surrounded by a small number of financiers in London, would rather encourage the fascist warlords and sacrifice democratic and weak countries, while allowing his compatriots in China to suffer all kinds of insults from the Japanese, and allowing his interests of more than a hundred years to be squeezed out by the Japanese. At the beginning of the Sino-British conference, a preliminary agreement was reached, and then the four suspects were willing to submit to the puppet organization. There is now a rumor that the British side is planning to hand over the Chinese silver in the British concession in Tianjin to the Japanese side. All these actions are not only obviously unfavorable to China, but also sufficient to fuel the anti-British movement by the Japanese in China. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

### Committee for Collecting Winter Clothing Formulates This Year's Collection Plan; Aim to Collect Three Million Cotton Vests Within Two Months; Work to Begin Simultaneously in All Regions on September 1st

(Chongqing) The National Winter Clothing Collection Movement Committee has formulated the collection plan for the 28th year, with the aim of starting work simultaneously in all regions from September 1st and collecting three million cotton vests within two months to distribute to the soldiers fighting in the war. Old clothes will also be collected and distributed to refugees. The National Winter Clothing Collection Association will be the coordinating organization, and the various branches and offices will be the implementing agencies for collection, sewing, and distribution. The number of items to be contributed will be determined according to the economic conditions of each province and city, with Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Chongqing each contributing 200,000 items; Fujian 150,000 items; Hubei, Jiangxi, Xikang, Henan, and Gansu each contributing 100,000 items; and Zhejiang, Anhui, and Qinghai each contributing 50,000 items, totaling three million items. Due to transportation issues, the Nanyang, Shanghai, and Hong Kong areas will be limited to raising funds. The number of funds to be contributed has also been stipulated, with Nanyang and overseas areas contributing one million yuan, Shanghai 200,000 yuan, and Hong Kong 100,000 yuan. Based on past experience and current transportation conditions, after the funds are raised in various regions, suitable locations with convenient transportation and sufficient materials and labor will be selected in each province and city for sewing and distribution. One cotton vest will be valued at 1.5 yuan in national currency. After the vests are made, they can be directly distributed by each province and city to the troops, new recruits, wounded soldiers, and sick soldiers in their respective provinces and cities or neighboring provinces and cities. However, before distribution, the number and the troop number to which they are being distributed must be notified to the association so that the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Political Department can plan as a whole to avoid duplication. If sewing is impossible due to difficulties in purchasing materials or transportation inconveniences, the collected funds can be remitted to the association for manufacturing and distribution. In addition, Xi'an, Yichang, Chongqing, Guilin, and Ji'an will be the five locations for the concentration and distribution of cotton vests. All provincial branches, except those that distribute directly, will concentrate on these five major manufacturing and distribution locations. The funds remitted by each province to the association will also be distributed to the respective manufacturing locations to continue sewing. In terms of old clothes, regardless of size or length, all will be collected. Cash donations in lieu of clothing are also welcome and can be handed over to the Central Relief Committee or local relief agencies for collection and distribution. Those without affiliated agencies of the Relief Committee can still ask the Winter Clothing Collection Association and its branches to collect and forward them. The materials for cotton vests should be mainly sturdy and durable coarse cloth that does not shine. Gray is the preferred color, but black, blue, tea, and green are also acceptable. Each item should be limited to seven taels of cotton or coarse wool. Leather items can be used in place of cotton and wool in the Northwest. (Dispatch, 30th)

### Flooded Area in North China Covers 30,000 Square Miles

Goods destroyed in warehouses amounted to 10 million yuan. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

(Tianjin) The Japanese consul here lodged a protest yesterday with the British consul-general in Tianjin, Jameson. The protest was because the British side used the Yokohama Specie Bank building in the British concession as a temporary refugee shelter. It is said that this happened last Saturday. The Japanese consul's protest stated that the British side's use of the Zhengjin building as a refugee shelter without the consent of the Japanese side was an illegal action. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th) Tokyo According to Japanese sources received here today, the British authorities in the Tianjin British Concession have occupied the Yokohama Specie Bank building to house flood refugees. The Japanese consul-general has protested to the British authorities. According to reports, the building has been uninhabited since the British concession began its blockade. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

(Rome) The authorities here received a report from the Italian consulate in Tianjin, stating that the reports of widespread flooding in the Tianjin area are not entirely accurate.

Several German trading companies are said to have been mortgaged to Dutch and other foreign nationals. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

### Eden Delivers Broadcast Speech to America

(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a broadcast speech to the United States, stating, in brief: "Regarding the current disputes in Europe, any solution that does not strengthen the peace front and prove that the method of using force to obtain concessions is bound to fail, there is absolutely no room for acceptance. We pray that victory belongs to us, and we must resist all provocative actions, whether peaceful or non-peaceful. As for the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, Germany believes that this move will greatly embarrass the countries on the peace front. This intention has actually made a big mistake in psychology, because the countries that were panicked by this move were not the countries on the peace front, but Germany's friendly countries and allies." In conclusion, he said, "In any case, we cannot merely seek to prolong our lives under the threat of a gun." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Bergen, Norway US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, in view of the dangerous situation in Europe, has now shortened his vacation period in Europe and is returning to the United States as quickly as possible. Today, he has boarded the Coast Guard ship specially dispatched by US President Roosevelt to return home (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### US Customs Inspecting German Imports; Paying Attention to Armed Equipment

(New York) After refusing to issue a clearance to the German scheduled liner Bremen today, customs sent searchers to board the ship and inspect "goods and storage items not listed on the manifest, as well as inspect crew members, passengers, and many other matters." Seventeen foreigners on board were detained at night and taken to Ellis Island because their documents were not satisfactory. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

(Washington) After the German mail ship "Bremen" was detained by the New York Port Authority, it was rumored that the German Embassy in the United States had lodged a protest with the US State Department. The State Department issued a statement today denying this, saying that as of now, the German Embassy has not made any representations. (Havas, 30th)

(New York) The German ship "Wigant" sailed from Philadelphia, USA, to Norfolk City on the 20th of this month. Since then, there has been no news. However, the authorities learned that when the ship anchored at Margos Port in Delaware, the captain received a wireless telegram, and shortly thereafter, two passengers boarded the ship with suspicious tracks. Attention has been paid to this and several naval patrol ships have been ordered to search for the whereabouts of the "Wigant." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

(Washington) After the "North German Lloyd Company" mail ship "Bremen" was detained by the New York Port Authority, the company claimed that the German Embassy in the United States had lodged a protest with the State Department. Regarding this matter, President Roosevelt made a statement to reporters, stating that in addition to the "Bremen," other foreign ships anchored in American ports have also been detained for inspection. The purpose of this move is to determine whether these ships can be equipped with weapons for offensive use in wartime, and there is no unusual significance. All ships of countries that may become belligerents must be inspected. In short, if merchant ships of various countries are equipped with weapons for defensive purposes only, they can be allowed to anchor in American ports. However, if there is reason to believe that these armed merchant ships can attack other countries' merchant ships on the high seas, they should be detained to relieve the United States of its responsibility for harboring them. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

(Washington) The military authorities in the Panama Canal Zone have received orders from their superiors to have a squad of soldiers board and escort any ships passing through the canal from today onwards. It is said that this precautionary measure is to deal with "extraordinary" events.

### British and Japanese Troops Briefly Clashed in Shenzhen: Dozens of Casualties on Both Sides; Secret Negotiations Underway; Strict Security Measures in Hong Kong

Hong Kong Dispatch: After the Japanese army reoccupied Shenzhen, there was talk of blockading Hong Kong, so the situation on the Sino-British border suddenly became serious. On the 23rd, four Japanese transport ships sailed to Chiwan waters close to Hong Kong and anchored, carrying about a thousand cavalry and three thousand infantry. After landing in Nantou, they went to Shenzhen and Shatoujiao, tightly surrounding the northern part of Hong Kong's Kowloon New Territories. On the same day, another forty to fifty Japanese gunboats, cruisers, and armed fishing boats gathered in the waters outside Kap Shui Mun and Lei Yue Mun, less than five miles from British territorial waters. The Hong Kong authorities, seeing the Japanese army and navy gathering on the Sino-British border, expected some intention and, with news of the tense situation in Europe also reaching Hong Kong, issued an emergency order to transfer British and Indian troops to the New Territories for defense, to prevent invasion. A solid trench was built from the south bank of the Shenzhen River through Fanling to Shatoujiao. The railway bridge connecting Luohu Station and Shenzhen and the highway bridges connecting Man Kam To in the New Territories to Shatoujiao via Sheung Shui were all blown up with explosives, cutting off traffic on the Sino-British border. Landmines were also buried at strategic points, actively preparing for war. Transportation vehicles, troop carriers, artillery carriers, and material carriers in Kowloon traveled back and forth all day. All British engineering personnel and electrical engineering personnel in Hong Kong were summoned and sent to the New Territories to provide services, setting up military telephones and defensive electrical grids, their work being extraordinarily busy.

One Hour of Fierce Fighting

Unexpectedly, after dusk on the 23rd, a squadron of about a hundred Japanese cavalry suddenly charged into the British-controlled Man Kam To highway and opened fire as a demonstration. At that time, British and Indian troops were busy deploying defenses on the front. Suddenly seeing Japanese cavalry charging into the defense line, they immediately returned fire to stop them. The sentries of the British and Japanese armies clashed, and fierce fighting lasted for about an hour. The sounds of machine guns and artillery rumbled incessantly, audible to residents in Sham Shui Po and Kowloon. Later, a large force of British infantry advanced from Shatin and Tai Po to reinforce the front, eventually repelling the Japanese cavalry. In this battle, eighteen British soldiers and over thirty Indian soldiers were injured or killed. The number of Japanese soldiers injured or killed was also equal. The Hong Kong military authorities, upon receiving reports of the frontline clash, immediately used the telephone to sternly question the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong and telegraphed the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Shenzhen to prevent the escalation of the situation. Therefore, after about an hour of fierce fighting, the frontline sentries of both sides ceased fire. That night, security on the Sino-British border was extremely strict. Sanitary teams and ambulances traveled to the New Territories all night, transporting wounded soldiers back to Hong Kong. Troop carriers were again busy on the road, and residents throughout Hong Kong were even more shocked. After this incident, the military authorities of both Britain and Japan were unwilling to escalate the situation and prohibited the spread of such news. The authorities of both sides are currently engaged in secret negotiations, intending to resolve the matter through diplomatic means.

British Women and Children Leave Hong Kong

On the 24th, the Hong Kong Air Defense Department convened an emergency meeting to discuss the zonal deployment of air defenses. All Hong Kong police and reserve police were also ordered to assemble and distribute work. From that day on, there was a general mobilization to maintain local security. Off-duty police officers were not allowed to leave their posts for more than two hours without reason, and others were assigned to guard, fire, rescue, and various other tasks. British women and children originally residing in Fanling, Sheung Shui, Luohu, and Tai Po, and in areas closer to the front line in the New Territories, were all required to return to Hong Kong or Kowloon, or were advised to voluntarily evacuate back to their home countries or go to the Philippines. Therefore, British people taking ships to leave Hong Kong continued one after another. The reporter saw a British woman with three children about ten years old in a furniture store on the main street, buying several suitcases. When the shop owner asked what they were for, the woman said she was packing her luggage to evacuate back to her home country, adding that her property, accumulated through more than twenty years of hard work, was all in the New Territories. It was worrying to have to abandon it and leave. As she spoke, she sobbed and wept, looking very sad.

Mines Placed in Harbor

The day after the clash between British and Japanese troops, the British Navy also ordered the partial blockade of the harbor and the deployment of mines. Dangerous objects were first laid in the waters off Lei Yue Mun and Cape Collinson on the eastern side of Hong Kong. The Marine Department notified ships leaving the harbor that they must pass more than 3,000 feet away from the Cape Collinson lighthouse to avoid danger. At night, small boats were anchored at the eastern end of the blockade line, displaying two red lights as a signal to indicate the shipping lane. The Hong Kong army and navy have close communication and deployment, so defense can be guaranteed. It is also heard that a large number of land, sea, and air forces from Singapore will arrive in Hong Kong soon to assist in defense, so the people are quite calm.

Japanese Forces are Weak

According to a military spokesperson, the tense defense deployment in Hong Kong was influenced by the situation in Europe, not by the Japanese army's pressure on the New Territories. He also said that the Japanese army's strength was very weak, at most only ten thousand or so people. The local land, sea, and air forces are far superior to the Japanese army, and their quality is several times better than the Japanese army. Furthermore, Japan is being restrained by the Chinese army, so it has no ability to attack Hong Kong. Only because of the drastic changes in the European situation, and for the sake of preparedness, it is necessary to gather military strength and make strict deployments to prevent any eventuality. According to sources, the Japanese army's plan to threaten Hong Kong was before Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression treaty. Unexpectedly, during the troop movements, news of the signing of the German-Soviet treaty suddenly arrived, and Japan's plan against Britain suffered a major blow. In this changing new situation, Japan would certainly not threaten Britain too much. There are about two reasons for this pressure on Hong Kong: (1) The Japanese army's threat to Hong Kong is deliberately creating a serious situation to make Britain aware of the difficulty of taking care of the Far East and to promote compromise between Britain and Japan; (2) Although negotiations in Tokyo have stalled, Japan also does not want a breakdown, so it is using this to promote the resumption of Anglo-Japanese negotiations, hoping for British concessions to resolve all issues. Now that the British authorities have determined that the Japanese army is unable to put pressure on Hong Kong, there is no possibility of expanding the conflict between Britain and Japan in the Far East. However, the impact of the situation in the Far East also depends on how the war in Europe develops.

### British Missionary in Suzhou Inspected by Japanese Troops

British and American Goods All Banned from Sale

Suzhou Dispatch: Under the guidance of the Japanese army, the puppet organization in Suzhou held an anti-British movement, and recently implemented a boycott of British goods. The organizers are the Suzhou Special Service Agency on the Japanese side and the Puppet Greater People's Association and the Puppet County Government on the puppet side. Starting with the shops, all British-made cigarettes, woolens, medicines, etc., were stamped with seals and sealed, and they were not allowed to be sold. The Japanese soldiers at each city gate also inspected British goods and strictly inspected pedestrians entering and leaving the city. Anyone found by the Japanese army to be carrying British-made goods would be severely slapped and have all items confiscated. On the 23rd, two British missionaries, a man and a woman, passed through the Chang Gate, intending to enter the city. They were stopped by Japanese sentries who asked them their nationality. Knowing that they were British, they punched them in the chest. The British woman next to him argued with them, and the Japanese soldier pointed a bayonet at her and ordered them to take out all the money and belongings on them for inspection. The British man had no choice but to let the Japanese soldier touch him randomly. After ten minutes, the Japanese soldier waved his hand to let them enter the city. As for the British woman, she was inspected by a Chinese puppet female police officer.

### Japanese Military Movements in Yangzhou: Internal Conflicts Among Officers; Espionage Activities

Yangzhou Dispatch: Gui Wulang, the head of the Japanese army's special task force in Yangzhou, was transferred to Nanjing this time because of differences with the head of the military police, Tsuchiya, and mutual attacks. Currently, the Japanese side in Nanjing has also transferred Tsuchiya back.

Because the Japanese army in Yangzhou has been frequently attacked by guerrillas in various places, suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese and puppet troops in Yangzhou have been repeatedly transferred to various places to reinforce them, causing the residents to be quite alarmed. The Japanese side is also afraid that the people will move away, so they have specially sent a large number of puppets to handle the five-household joint guarantee system, not allowing people to move.

Recently, about two hundred Japanese and Taiwanese ruffians have arrived in Yangzhou, all of whom can speak the dialects of Shanghai, Beiping, Qingjiang, Huaiyang, Zhenjiang, and other places, specializing in probing Chinese military intelligence. These spies have dark skin and all wear Chinese casual clothes, looking like Chinese farmers on the outside. They will soon be assigned to work in various places, with three people in a group. Each group will be joined by a local Chinese traitor.

### Ministry of Finance Maintains Credit: National Salvation Bonds to Pay Interest Today; Payment in Cash or Remittance Pending Telegraphic Instructions; Simultaneously Discounting and Paying the Rejuvenation Bonds

The Ministry of Finance's unwavering commitment to maintaining credit: The National Salvation Bonds due at the end of August have been allocated from the national treasury's tax revenue and are scheduled to be paid by the Central Bank starting today. The seventh tranche of principal and interest of the Rejuvenation Bonds will be discounted by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, with payments starting simultaneously. The details are as follows:

National Salvation Bonds to Start Paying Interest

The total amount of National Salvation Bonds issued is 500 million National currency. The second payment of interest is 20 million National currency. According to regulations, it is due on August 31st. After the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank telegraphed the head office in Chongqing for instructions, it received a reply from the head office the night before last, approving payment on schedule. The interest payment has been allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury's tax revenue. The branch bank telegraphed the head office in Chongqing again yesterday morning, asking whether the Shanghai branch should pay in cash or by remittance, as the reply did not specify. As of last night, no reply had been received. It is expected that a reply will be received this morning, and action will be taken accordingly. According to financial experts, Shanghai will pay by remittance.

Rejuvenation Bonds to be Paid by Remittance

The seventh tranche of principal and interest of the 1936 Rejuvenation Bonds, totaling 1.1594 million National currency, including 1.7 million yuan in principal and 9.8944 million yuan in interest, will be discounted and paid by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has been notified by the head office to discount and pay the bonds starting today, through the branch and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications. The payment will be made in six installments and by remittance. However, bondholders must fill out an application for discounting customs-guaranteed domestic debt principal and interest. The fund is guaranteed by customs duties. Now, because customs duties in the occupied areas have been intercepted, the Ministry of Finance has been forced to temporarily suspend the payment of principal and interest. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has negotiated with the four banks to agree to discount and pay the bonds.

Unified Gold Bond to be Drawn on Schedule

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from silver firms yesterday that the National Debt Fund Management Committee has scheduled the drawing of the eighth tranche of the Class B bonds of the 1936 Unified Public Bonds, the twelfth tranche of the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Bonds, the 16th tranche of the 1931 Telecommunications Public Bonds, the seventh tranche of the 1937 Financial Consolidation of Guangdong Public Bonds, and the sixth tranche of the 1937 Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project US Dollar Bonds at 10:00 AM on September 9th. The committee has sent letters to the Chamber of Commerce, the Silver Firms Association, the First Special District Court, the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications, inviting them to send representatives to supervise the lottery at the time. Regarding the repayment of principal and interest of the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Bonds, it is heard that the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank have agreed to discount and pay the bonds.

### Kato Gaimusho Departs for China

According to Japanese sources in this city, Minister Kato Gaimusho, who played an active role in the Tokyo Anglo-Japanese conference and bears the mission of handling international relations with great subtlety and complexity, boarded an express train at Tokyo Station at 3:00 PM on the 30th to take up his post in Shanghai. After taking office, Mr. Kato is scheduled to visit various parts of China, including Central China, South China, and North China, to conduct an on-the-ground inspection of foreign relations.

### Sino-Foreign Charity Association Initiates Relief for Tianjin Disaster

According to the person in charge of the Sino-Foreign Charity Association at 97 Renji Road in this city, the lives of residents in the Tianjin concession have been extremely difficult since it was blockaded. Unexpectedly, troubles never come singly. The river suddenly rose, and Tianjin became a waterlogged area. In the suburbs, people and animals were swept away, and the numbers were difficult to estimate. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are moving towards Beiping, Tanggu, and other places, supporting the old and carrying the young, in a miserable state. Moreover, due to the stagnant water in the disaster area, there are many cases of malaria, and cholera is rampant. The association received a telegram from Honorary President Sun Zhongying and an appeal from the Tianjin YMCA, and decided to appeal to all sectors at home and abroad for assistance in dealing with the Tianjin disaster, and will first transport a large batch of epidemic medicines to Tianjin for distribution to meet the urgent needs.

### British and Polish Diplomats Arrive in Shanghai Successively

Rosset, the new Polish Chargé d'affaires (the French spelling, previously mistaken as Basituo), has reportedly been formally notified by the Polish government to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Mr. Rosset will arrive in Shanghai at the end of January and take office on February 1.

Mr. Cottrell, the Director General of the British Consulate General in Shanghai, left Shanghai in February for a short trip to Japan. It is now known that Mr. Cottrell and his wife returned from Japan on January 8.

### Tribute Rice Specially Approved for Exchange and Tax Exemption: Reducing the Burden on Civilians; Specifically Used for Price Stabilization and Refugee Food; Estimated Price About 20 Yuan Per Shi

The National Government's Concern for People's Food is Inspiring

Mr. Yu Qiaqing, in view of the serious panic in Shanghai's food supply, in addition to the Refugee Relief Association and various groups ordering 18,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon to transport to Shanghai for refugee relief and price stabilization, also jointly requested the Executive Yuan and President Kong through Li Fusun and Xu Jiyu for foreign exchange of 10,000 pounds sterling, which has been approved by reply telegram and specially approved for tax-free import, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The 10,000 pounds of foreign exchange approved by the Executive Yuan, calculated according to the posted rate of seven pence by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, has already ordered 18,000 bags, each bag containing one stone and two and a half dou, totaling 22,500 shi, which has been loaded onto the Norwegian Hague Wheel in Saigon and has already set sail yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on September 5 or 6. Among them, 10,000 bags were ordered by the Refugee Relief Association and will be distributed to various shelters as refugee food after arriving in Shanghai. The remaining 8,000 bags will be handed over to rice industry groups to be responsible for distributing them to various stores for price stabilization. The sales price and detailed methods will be decided separately at that time. In short, it is stipulated that rice shops, in addition to receiving a small agency fee, will sell at the original price, so as to reduce the burden on ordinary civilians. The number of 8,000 bags is not enough to distribute, but it will provide some assistance. We will continue to purchase in the future until the price of domestic rice is suppressed.

Price Approximately 20 Yuan Per Shi

Regarding the funds for ordering foreign rice, Yu Qiaqing, Li Fusun, and Xu Jiyu jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request the supply of foreign exchange, and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has replied by telegram approving the purchase of 10,000 pounds sterling according to the posted rate of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The current legal exchange rate is seven pence, while the black market foreign exchange is four pence, which is three pence more. Therefore, according to this calculation, the original estimate of more than 30 yuan was needed per shi of foreign rice; with the purchase of legal foreign exchange and approval for tax-free import, it can be lowered by one-third, that is, 20 legal currency. This is sufficient proof of the National Government's concern for the food supply of Shanghai citizens and reducing the suffering of the people. Its virtuous government and good intentions are truly inspiring.

Registration and Ordering Proceed as Usual

As for the registration for ordering foreign rice, as of the 28th, there were a total of 2,181 bags. The accountants who went to the Accountant's Association yesterday and the day before yesterday included the Shanghai Silk Industry Association (56 bags), Dazhong Company (50 bags), Qian Changxiang (50 bags), Dazhong Bank (50 bags), Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory (100 bags), and Qiantai Xiang Five Branches (50 bags), totaling 356 bags, for a total of 2,536 bags. Since the City Chamber of Commerce notified the various industry associations to order foreign rice, yesterday the various industry associations flocked to the chamber to collect registration forms, so it is said that each industry is registering in large quantities. According to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, as soon as enough orders are received to fill a ship with 20,000 bags, the purchase will be made and loaded onto a special ship for transport to Shanghai, but the exchange rate will not be the posted rate of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications.

Supply Exceeds Demand, Rice Prices Gradually Fall

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council negotiated with the Japanese side and obtained sympathy for unclogging sources, the source of domestic rice has gradually been unblocked. Although there has been no large influx in recent days, it has been able to be transported to Shanghai successively, and a large number is expected to be transported to Shanghai soon. Yesterday, only six ships arrived at the river, totaling 1,141 shi, due to the typhoon. A total of 21,738 bags were offered for sale in the rice market, but because the supply exceeded the demand, only about a thousand bags were sold. Prices continued to fall sharply. Indica rice fell by two yuan, with the highest price being 23 to 25 yuan. White japonica rice fell by three yuan, to 27 yuan, with the highest price being 31 yuan for a whole bag. The other grades of winter frost fragrant japonica rice were also weak and tired. This is sufficient evidence that people's hearts are stable and the panic over food rice seems to have gradually lessened. It is also heard that the Japanese Mitsui & Co. has purchased 10,000 bags of Indica rice from Wuhu and will ship them to Shanghai in batches for sale. With the special permission of Acting Chairman Han of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Indica rice from the Jiangbei area will be loaded onto ships from ports and other places and transported to Shanghai to supply food to the people in the concession.

### Editor of the Greater Shanghai Evening News, Zhu Xinggong, Assassinated; Died Tragically from Vital Wound; Suspect Apprehended

Zhu Xinggong, also known as Misonglu, was a native of Lucheng, Dantu County, Jiangsu. He was 38 years old. He was upright, outspoken, and treated people with sincerity, which is rare in modern times. His wife, Ms. He, named Liying, shared a deep affection with him. They had one son, seven years old, who was just beginning his education. Zhu had a deep understanding and belief in classical literature and morality.

He had many writings and was respected by the cultural community. On the first day of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the American-owned Greater Shanghai Evening News hired Zhu to formally join the newspaper as an editor for the night edition because of his reputation. His residence was at 94 North Henan Road in the Public Concession. Because he lived frugally, he always walked instead of taking a car when going out. Yesterday at about 4:00 PM, Zhu walked out of his residence as usual and walked to the Greater Shanghai Evening News. Unexpectedly, while walking on North Henan Road near the Bund Building on Tiantong Road, he suddenly encountered

Three Assailants

who emerged from the roadside, approached Zhu, and blocked him. One of them took out a gun and shot Zhu. Zhu was unable to escape and was shot in the left temple, immediately falling to the ground and dying. The assailants fled as soon as their goal was achieved. Nearby police officers rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and searched for the perpetrators. At the same time, the Huidong Police Station, upon receiving the report, immediately sent Chinese Detectives Shang Shenbo and Zhu Mengwei to lead detectives to the scene to pursue the perpetrators. A suspect was apprehended on the spot and taken back to the police station for interrogation. The police immediately called an ambulance to rush Zhu to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was too late because the vital wound had already taken his life. Afterwards, the Greater Shanghai Evening News urgently notified Zhu's family and published an extra edition about Zhu's death. Zhu's wife

received the tragic news and almost fainted from grief. Fortunately, she was revived by others. She rushed to Renji with her young son, mourning over his body and crying uncontrollably. The child's cries were especially heartbreaking. Friends present could not help but shed tears of sympathy. Because Zhu's family was poor, all the funeral arrangements were handled jointly by the newspaper and Zhu's relatives and friends. Zhu's body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road morgue that night, awaiting

Court Inspection to be applied for tomorrow morning, and a coffin will be placed at the Dazhong Funeral Home at the end of Jiaozhou Road at 3:00 PM on September 1st, with white carts and white horses to express mourning and honor. It is also learned that Zhu had received many warning letters due to his professional duties before his death. The day before the incident, he received another letter. The reason for his death is still under investigation by the police.

### British Merchant Ships Ordered to Adopt Alert Plan; Will Sail Directly to Singapore Upon Receiving Orders; French, German, and Italian Ships Have Not Received Special News

The Mainland News reported that British officials yesterday (29th) issued a secret order to British shipping companies in this area instructing them on the precautionary plans to be adopted by British ships in the Far East in the event of war. British naval officers stationed in Shanghai did not confirm the issuance of this order.

Taikoo and Jardine Matheson Have Received Secret Orders

However, it is heard that the four British companies, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, British American Tobacco, and Moller, have received the order, but it is of a strictly confidential nature, and detailed instructions have been given to the masters of each ship. It is generally believed that if Britain is drawn into the war, the British Admiralty, which has supreme control over British ships worldwide, will order merchant ships to report to the nearest British naval base. British ships in Chinese waters may sail directly to Singapore.

To be Requisitioned One Day to Carry Food

Yesterday, most shipping companies stated categorically that there had been no change in the routes of their ships currently on the high seas. All emergency actions will be taken separately and directly upon receiving orders from the Admiralty. It is widely believed that many of the ships that receive orders at that time will be used to transport food and raw materials to Europe to supply the Allied forces, but there will also be many ships that continue their current trade in East Asian waters.

Italian and British Officials Extremely Silent

Italian and British naval officials in Shanghai are extremely silent about the movements of their warships docked in Shanghai. The Italian troop transport ship Carlo Trotto, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, suddenly stopped sailing out. The British authorities have no knowledge of British ships arriving in or leaving Shanghai.

German Merchant Ships Have No New Developments

After German merchant ships in Eastern waters received orders from the government a few days ago to sail as quickly as possible to the nearest neutral port, no new developments have been reported from German shipping companies in this area. The North German Company's Xianghuosi Tuolun, which left Shanghai on the 21st of this month, sailed out of Manila a few days later, intending to go to Singapore, but suddenly returned and is still docked in Manila.

French Postal Ship Has Not Received Government Instructions

The French Postal Ship Company had not received any special instructions from the French government yesterday regarding the disposition of the company's ships in the event of an international war. The Changxing Shipping Company has also not received any orders from the British Embassy in this area.

### Overflowing Autumn Tides on the Huangpu River: Hurricane Warning Lifted; Wind Shifted Northward Yesterday Morning, Passing Over the Tongsha Sea; Import and Export Mail Expected to Return to Normal Today

Two Women Tragically Killed

After a Pacific hurricane shifted its direction from northwest to west-northwest, heading directly towards Shanghai, the city was intensely disturbed by the outer edges of the storm. At 6 PM the previous evening, the hurricane was only 120 nautical miles from Shanghai, and the situation was critical. However, starting from midnight, the wind shifted northward, and the eye of the hurricane passed over the Tongsha Sea, 40 nautical miles east of Shanghai, at 4 AM yesterday. Shanghai was spared a direct hit. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6 AM yesterday, the hurricane had reached 31.45 degrees north latitude and 122.30 degrees east longitude, with its center within a 30-nautical-mile radius. The direction had shifted to northwest or north-northwest, and the wind force remained fierce. Upon checking the reported location, it was over the Sheweishan waters off Tongsha, outside Wusongkou. The center had moved more than ten nautical miles north of Shanghai. Therefore, the threat of the hurricane's impact on Shanghai has been completely lifted.

Shanghai Suburbs Also Experience Gale-Force Winds

Yesterday morning, Shanghai was significantly affected by the edge of the storm. In the open fields around Xujiahui, the wind force was sharp, reaching levels of 7 to 9. At zero hours yesterday morning, high tide in the Huangpu River was stirred up by the wind, and the tidal water began to rise onto the shore. The Bund was submerged, and roads such as Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Guizhou Road, Yuyuan Road, Jessfield Road, Avenue Foch, and Avenue Joffre were inundated, forming a "water kingdom." As of last night, the water had not completely receded. The hurricane is heading towards Qingdao.

By 2 PM yesterday afternoon, the Xujiahui Observatory continued to report that the hurricane had reached 32.30 degrees north latitude and an unspecified east longitude, with the eye of the storm within a 60-nautical-mile radius. The direction officially shifted from northwest to north-northwest, and the wind force remained extremely fierce. Upon checking the reported location, the hurricane had advanced to the Yellow Sea, 200 nautical miles north of Shanghai, heading towards Qingdao. The Jianghai Customs immediately removed two black balls from the top of the building and at Wusongkou on Avenue Lanlu, indicating that the hurricane had passed Shanghai.

Huangpu River Ships to Resume Sailing Today

The customs black ball was removed at approximately 3 PM yesterday, and the warning was lifted. However, although the ships had received news that the hurricane had passed, it was too late to complete the departure procedures, so they had to remain suspended for another day. If the wind remains stable today, full service is expected to resume.

### Delays in Import and Export of Mail Ships

There were no incoming ships yesterday. Only one outgoing ship, the "Store Nordiske" of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, left at 5 PM yesterday from buoys 18 and 19. This ship was repairing submarine cables. The British mail ship "Kashgar," which was scheduled to leave for Europe on Tuesday, August 29, was repeatedly delayed due to the hurricane. It is now scheduled to depart at 7 AM this morning, returning to London. The American President Lines' "President Pierce," coming from the United States to Shanghai, was expected to arrive at noon yesterday but had not arrived by evening. According to the company, it was likely sheltering from the storm at sea and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. However, the exact time is uncertain because the company has not received a report from the ship. The Italian mail ship "Giulio Cesare," which arrived in Shanghai from Venice on August 28 and docked at the Kung Ho Hsiang wharf in Hongkou, finished unloading cargo. It was originally scheduled to depart for Europe yesterday, but it was delayed due to the hurricane. Now it is said that due to special circumstances, it may be delayed in Shanghai for several more days. A definite message is expected this morning. The date of the ship's departure for Hong Kong and Luzon will also be delayed accordingly. The Hai Fo of the Reiss Company, joining the Shanghai-Ningbo line, was delayed due to the hurricane. According to the company, all passengers and cargo have been loaded, and it is scheduled to depart at 4 AM this morning, first heading to Zhenhai. The import ships today should be able to return to normal. The Huangpu River ferries also did not operate yesterday.

Two Women Sacrificed Their Lives

Yesterday, the sign of the Parisian Grocery Company at 983 Avenue Joffre was broken by the hurricane, injuring two women.

According to the Continental News, last night (the 29th), responsible parties heard that foreign businesses in Shanghai were dealing with the "Great Way" government and the Japanese army.

### Father An Murdered at the Xujiahui Cathedral: Discovered Lifeless at 5 PM; Bizarre Case Attracts Attention of French Authorities

Yesterday, a bizarre murder case suddenly occurred inside the Tushanwan Cathedral in Xujiahui, Shanghai, and the victim was the director of the church, Father An. Details are recorded below.

Father's Brief History

Father An, a Frenchman, was over sixty years old. He had been preaching in China for many years. He was upright, sincere, diligent, cautious, and kind. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to charity, so he was deeply admired by the people of Shanghai. He once worked at Aurora University, and then dedicated himself to the orphanage and craft factory founded by the Tushanwan Cathedral, where he served as the director for twelve years.

Not Seen Downstairs

The orphanage and craft factory has been painstakingly managed by Father An. Currently, there are more than 700 workers. Father An lived in a room in the south building of the church next to the factory. Around 9 AM yesterday morning, someone saw Father An downstairs inspecting. However, Father An was not seen downstairs for lunch. At that time, no one paid attention, because Father An sometimes did not come down for lunch.

Lifeless for a Long Time

Around 5 PM in the afternoon, an orphaned worker went upstairs to report important matters to Father An. As soon as he pushed open the door, he saw Father An with his hands tied, murdered on the floor of his room. The worker screamed in horror. People heard the sound and rushed to the scene, but Father An had been lifeless for a long time. He was already cold to the touch. He immediately reported to the police station. The police chief immediately led Chinese and Western detectives to investigate in detail.

Officials Inspect

At the same time, the French military commander stationed in Shanghai and senior officials of the Consulate and the Public Works Bureau heard the news and personally went to inspect. This shows the extent to which Father An was respected in peacetime. The body is still temporarily kept in the room where he lived, waiting for the French authorities to examine it before preparing the coffin.

Reasons Speculated

As for the reason for An's death, according to general speculation, the orphanage and craft factory run by Father An was scheduled to issue a total of more than 4,000 yuan in salaries at the end of each month. Today was the salary payment day. The murderer assumed that Father An had already prepared the salary money in advance, so he committed this heinous act one day early. Whether the money was stolen is being kept absolutely secret by the police. On the one hand, they are intensifying their efforts to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.

### A Difficult Time for Monks: Three Cases Go to Trial Simultaneously; Monk Denies Instigating Escape

The High Court Third Branch and the Second Special Court have a total of three courtrooms hearing cases of monks suing each other and being sued. Details are listed separately below:

Monk Wan Yuan Denies Instigating

Yang Sunshi (Sun Lanzhen, 35 years old, from Gaoyou), the beloved concubine of Yang Yunwu, a Gaoyou native who previously served as a county magistrate during the warlord era, was allegedly seduced and instigated by Wan Yuan, the resident monk of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple in the Jin Shenfu Road Sheng Deli area (whose secular name is Tong Changyao, 30 years old, from Taizhou), to abscond on the tenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar this year, taking with her 2,500 yuan in cash, three gold bracelets, and property deeds. Wan Yuan hired a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper severing ties with Yang. Yang reported this to the French police, who first arrested Wan Yuan and found the stolen goods in his pillowcase. He was prosecuted by the Second Special Court for receiving stolen goods and sentenced to six months in prison. At the time, Yang Sunshi was at large, and the court issued a warrant for her arrest. She was recently apprehended and prosecuted by the Second Special Court for theft. After interrogation, Yang Sunshi was released on bail of 500 yuan. Details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Because Monk Wan Yuan was dissatisfied with the judgment, he hired Lawyer Xu Wufang to file an appeal with the High Court Third Branch. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Wang and Chen, held a collegial panel hearing. The appellant, Monk Wan Yuan, aka Tong Changyao, stated the grounds for his appeal, denying that he had seduced Yang Sunshi or instigated her escape. He only helped search for Sunshi after she ran away. The pillowcase found in his case was his own and not given to him by Sunshi. Witnesses Zhu Wanzhang and Zhang Yunfa testified that they saw the monk and Yang's concubine walking together and entering the Zhonghe Building at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road. However, Wan Yuan firmly denied this. The court reviewed the evidence and decided to postpone the hearing to bring Yang Sunshi to court for further questioning. The appellant was returned to custody.

Dispute Over Temple Property Rights Remains Unresolved

Due to a dispute over overdue mortgages, the Sanjiao Leshan Temple in the Jin Shenfu Road Sheng Deli area was sued by the Yeguang Company, the creditor, and the court ruled in favor of the execution and auction. Monk Qinliang, the resident monk of Jingci Temple in Hangzhou, purchased the temple and renamed it the Lower Courtyard of Jingci Temple and went to take it over. However, Monk Yuanhua of Sanjiao Leshan Temple refused to hand it over. Monk Qinliang filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Yuanhua of obstructing freedom. At the same time, Qinliang sent people to forcibly take over the temple, placing the temple's property in the Yuhuang Temple next door. Now, Monks Guanru and Licheng, along with Zhang Chenshi and Yu Shaoshi, hired Lawyer Liu Xiang to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Qinliang and laypersons Xia Jianfu, Wu Boliang, Zhao Jinyu, Bai E Po Na Xin (transliteration), and Fan Yusheng of obstructing freedom of worship, intimidation, extortion, and property damage. This was reported in a previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Second Special Court continued the hearing in the Sixth Criminal Court. Guanru and others' private prosecution against Qinliang and others for obstructing freedom, both parties arrived with their lawyers. After a detailed hearing, it was decided that the case would be suspended and the parties would be directed to confirm the ownership of the temple property in the Civil Division before proceeding with the hearing.

Lodging Monk Accused of Encroaching on Temple Property

Maolin, a monk currently residing at 1250 Connaught Road, 43 years old, from Yangzhou, filed a complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing Maochan, the resident monk of Baoguang Temple at 466 Xujiahui Road, Dapu Bridge, of encroaching on temple property and requesting an investigation, along with a civil suit to recover the temple property. According to the complaint, Baoguang Temple was founded by the plaintiff in the 25th year of the Republic. The defendant was one of the lodging monks in the temple. Last year, because a lodging monk left drugs in his room, the plaintiff was arrested and convicted. At that time, the plaintiff entrusted the temple affairs to lodging monk Puchan for management. However, the defendant drove Puchan out and took over the temple himself. When the plaintiff was released from prison and returned to the temple, the defendant refused to return the temple property. Repeated negotiations were ineffective. The defendant has committed the crime of encroachment and requests an investigation and an order to return the temple property and accounts. Based on the complaint, Judge Wu Kechou of the court held a hearing yesterday morning. Both parties arrived on time. After the plaintiff recounted the events, the defendant was questioned. The defendant denied the encroachment, claiming to be falsely accused, and presented evidence.

### Guangdong Education Department: Relieving Displaced Teachers and Students in War Zones, Has Ordered All Parties to Undertake Various Relief Efforts

(Shaoguan Correspondence) Since the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou became tense and counties and cities were ordered to evacuate, the Guangdong Education Department, in order to facilitate all levels of schools in coping with emergencies, previously formulated the "Measures for Handling Schools at All Levels in Evacuated Areas," which the provincial government has circulated for compliance. It is now found that there are many schools at all levels that cannot be moved, can be moved, or have had to suspend classes due to being close to the war zone. The teachers and students who have withdrawn from these schools should be provided with relief. The Education Department has instructed the principals of 20 counties, including Huiyang, Haifeng, Heyuan, Zijin, Xinfeng, Longmen, Raoping, Huilai, Puning, Fengshun, Xingning, Meixian, Wuhua, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Kai Chuan, Heping, and Dabu, and the principals of Meizhou Middle School, Meizhou Normal School, Meizhou Women's Normal School, Meizhou Agricultural School, and East River Temporary Middle School, to find ways to contact the principals and teachers of the withdrawing middle schools and accommodate them as much as possible. At the same time, they should handle registration in accordance with the regulations and submit it to the department for verification, and telegraph the administrative commissioners of the 4th, 5th, and 6th districts, explaining the relief measures and requesting them to transfer them to the counties and schools within their respective jurisdictions to accommodate them as much as possible. All accommodated students are allowed to stay in the school during the summer vacation, and their board and lodging expenses will be handled in accordance with the supplementary food expense measures issued by the department.

Also, according to reports, most of the teachers and students who withdrew from Qiongya stayed in Suixi and Hong Kong. The Education Department has provided them with relief, setting up registration offices in various places and setting up temporary middle schools to accommodate middle school students, and attaching elementary schools to the United Middle School to accommodate elementary school students. Regarding teacher relief, in addition to registration, service groups and united middle schools are being established for accommodation.

### Jiang Wenyu on the Great Era and the Elementary School Teacher (Part 2)

Expecting Special Actions from Elementary School Teachers

Reasonable Treatment for Material and Spiritual Needs

Eight Proposed Measures Eagerly Awaited for Implementation

First, let's talk about the issue of expectations. What we expect from elementary school teachers, of course, is that they can run elementary schools according to rules, teach children well within the school, abide by laws and regulations, explain clearly, and educate properly. However, in this great era, I believe that the mission they bear is more than that. It goes without saying that elementary school teachers in the so-called guerrilla areas in the rear should be able to use special educational methods to achieve special educational results. However, all elementary school teachers in the rear cannot just educate school children and consider that they have fulfilled their responsibilities. For example, assisting political workers in mobilizing the masses, helping local people organize self-government and self-defense, cooperating with guerrilla teams to undertake various military-related tasks, promoting the elimination of illiteracy among women, educating adults in addition to educating children, and finding ways to improve the health of local people, starting with protecting children in the school and gradually extending to the general public. It can be said that all these things were not necessary or required for elementary school teachers to do in the past. However, at this moment, they have to take on these additional responsibilities. This is the current practical need. In the future, after the war ends, how education will be revived in the places that have been destroyed and ravaged must also be thought of and prepared for now. If the school buildings are destroyed and the school equipment is gone, how do we restore the schools? If we wait for the county government to raise the construction and equipment costs one by one, or wait for the public to build the houses and purchase the school equipment before letting the elementary school teachers go to class in a leisurely manner, I am afraid it will not be easy. Not to mention that after the devastation, all construction requires funds, and funds cannot be raised in large amounts, and even if they are raised, they cannot be used exclusively for education. (Of course, comforting the displaced is the most important thing. Then, how do we revive education? In my opinion, elementary school teachers should have a special set of skills and special methods to cope with this special need. If there are no school buildings, it doesn't matter; the teachers can unite with nearby farmers and work together to build simple thatched houses, which cost little and can be completed quickly. If there are no desks, benches, blackboards, or even all the necessary school equipment, it doesn't matter; they can either make them themselves, or unite the farmers, explain the reasons, and let the children who come to school bring their own small desks and benches to school, according to the old private school methods. As for the simple instruments and specimens used in natural science teaching, and the simple charts and diagrams used in social science teaching, regardless of whether they are good or bad, as long as they exist, they can also be made by the teachers themselves. At the same time, in rural elementary schools, small workshops should be attached, and teachers should lead students to plant, raise livestock, and engage in simple manual manufacturing. In this way, not only can elementary education in the recovered areas be easily revived, but it can also be specially developed. Even the elementary schools that were originally in the rear can change their style and show a new atmosphere.

### Finance: British and American Exchange Rates Rebound Sharply; US Dollar in the City Becomes More Loose; Chinese Merchants Sell More Eagerly; Swap Has Been Tightened

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates rebounded sharply because the British and American exchange rates were encouraged by the Soviet Union's temporary suspension of approval of the non-aggression treaty signed with Germany, rising by 1 jiao and 1 fen and 1 jiao and 0.025 li respectively. The situation in Europe was not as bad as in the past few days. Therefore, the unofficial market in the city opened with an anti-image of strong British gold and loose American dollars. British gold was still 3 pence 9375, and the US dollar hardened to 7 yuan 1875. Later, because Germany and the Soviet Union were on good terms, Japan was eager to win over Britain and the United States, so there was a rumor of peace in the Far East. Therefore, the general long positions, such as China Bank and speculators, have all made double profits. When the current situation may change, they seize the opportunity to come out of the market. In addition, Hong Kong also sent a telegram to fill the market, so the US dollar market trend was uniquely loose and cheap. Once, the bank's buying reached 7 yuan 4375. However, because HSBC bought as much as possible at 4 pence, the loose trend was blocked, and the price stabilized at the 4 pence mark. Extending to the noon closing result, British gold only loosened 0.046875, while the US dollar soared 0.325. Because there was a rumor that the small quasi-swap arbitrage would start in September, Chinese merchants were more eager to sell September futures, and the loose trend was more severe than the spot price. In the end, British gold closed at 3 pence 78125, and the US dollar closed at 6 yuan 875. Therefore, the swap was tightened, with British gold only 0.203125 away and the US dollar only 0.04375 away, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6.3% (excluding commissions). In fact, it is still difficult for arbitragers to obtain it. The half-day transaction was still strong.

British Gold Stabilized at 4 Pence

In the early morning, London's large strips, both near and far, rose by 0.375. New York's silver price increased by 0.0875. London's raw gold shrank by 4 shillings. The exchange rate of British pound against the US dollar increased by 1 jiao and 1 fen, against Shanghai by 0.0125, and against France by 25 centimes. The US dollar against the British pound increased by 0.1025 li, against Shanghai by a small 0.75 yuan, and against France decreased by 0.0425. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 3 pence 9375 for British gold and 7 yuan 1875 for the US dollar, compared to the previous day, British gold was flat and the US dollar loosened by 0.01875, which was due to the sharp rebound in exchange rates. After the opening, foreign firms were quite willing to sell, but the buying appetite was not good. It is said that a certain US bank successively sold spot US dollars at 7 yuan 1875 and 25 to Japanese banks and foreign firms. Then, China Bank and speculators sold spot British gold at 4 pence to HSBC. Therefore, the process was firm. When HSBC's listed prices were announced and did not move, and the silver balance tax was announced, which was 2.25%, rumors of peace in the Far East caused most long positions to compete to sell. However, British gold was stabilized and unchanged because HSBC had unlimited buying appetite at 4 pence. However, because foreign firms were bullish on the US dollar exchange rate, their buying appetite was extremely weak, so it uniquely trended loose and cheap. China Bank and speculators successively sold spot British gold at 4 pence to HSBC, and also sold spot US dollars at 7 yuan 3125 to 4375 to foreign firms. Then, Chinese merchants sold September US dollars at 6 yuan 625 to 9375 to foreign firms. Near noon, a Hong Kong telegram sold spot British gold at 4 pence and spot US dollars at 7 yuan 375 to HSBC and other foreign firms. There were rumors of some swap trading. It is said that a British bank sold US dollars at a premium of 0.053125 to a peer bank, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 7.8% (excluding commissions). Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 984375 for British gold and 7 yuan 3125 for the US dollar. The September prices were 3 pence 78125 for British gold and 6 yuan 875 for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British gold increased by 0.046875, the US dollar strengthened by 0.3125, September British gold weakened by 0.00125, and the US dollar loosened by 0.5 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong US Dollar Also Saw a Sharp Loosening

Hong Kong, 30th Dispatch: The market opened this morning without a telegram to Shanghai. At 10:30, the market was firm. Spot British exchange rate was unchanged, still 1 shilling 2 pence 96875. Spot US dollar sharply loosened by 0.0875 to 27 yuan 625. At 11:05, it was stable. Spot British exchange rate tightened by 0.003125 to 1 shilling 3 pence 9375. Spot US dollar shrank by 0.00125 to 27 yuan 5 jiao. Shanghai exchange rate was unchanged, still 370 yuan. Japanese exchange rate was unknown.

More Foreign Currencies Fell Than Rose

Yesterday's foreign currencies were generally weak because the foreign exchange footings were loose and the cash was weak, hovering around the 4,000 yuan mark. The demand for British and American gold pounds was scarce and declined. The sentiment for British and American gold certificates was bleak and moved downstream. French franc certificates were also weakly small. Hong Kong, Singapore, Netherlands, and Roby certificates were all converted to firm and expensive because they were unrelated to the current situation. Canadian and Philippine certificates followed the loosening of the US dollar and went down. The demand for Siamese certificates was scarce, and the market was weak. Japanese gold certificates were stable, with the evening market at 1 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen 5 li. Korean certificates were still 1 yuan 0.05 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both decreased by 1 yuan, British gold certificates decreased by 0.2 yuan, US gold certificates decreased by 0.4 yuan, Hong Kong certificates increased by 0.02 yuan, French franc certificates decreased by 0.0005 yuan, Singapore, Netherlands, and Roby certificates all increased by 0.2 yuan, and Canadian, Philippine, and Siamese certificates all decreased by 0.2 yuan. There were no changes to other currencies.

British and American Silver Prices Recovered

London, 29th Dispatch: Large-strip silver market, both near and far, recovered by 0.375 due to speculative buying. Supply was limited, and the market was stable. After the closing, buyers were satisfied. The metal market came to sell, and there were buyers at 0.0625 below the listed price. Also, New York telegram: US silver price also increased by 0.0875 for spot goods, to 0.37 yuan. Also, Meng Mao telegram: Indian silver futures were unchanged, and there were no transactions.

Rediscount Rate Increased by 2.5 Yuan

Yesterday's exchange draft rediscount rate showed a slight increase. The morning rate was still 177.5 yuan per thousand yuan, and the afternoon rate slightly increased to 180 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was still 1.8 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Cash Selling Trend Strengthens

The cash market was still erratic yesterday, sometimes up and sometimes down, making it difficult to grasp. The psychology of large amounts had unfavorable news for the multi-party and tended to be weak. Generally, it first hovered, then declined, and then slightly recovered. Initially, because British pure gold sharply retreated and foreign exchange reported firmly, it retreated to 4,070 yuan at the morning opening. Later, because a certain money exchange industry still had buying appetite, it once pulled up to a high of 4,110 yuan. Soon, there was a sudden rumor of peace in the market, and the US dollar exchange rate soared, so the general retail investors who were timid immediately came out of the market. At the same time, the silver shop gangs also frequently came to sell, and the Hong Kong gang's purchasing stopped, causing the market price to plummet to 4,020 yuan. At noon, it slightly recovered to 4,040 yuan at the closing. The afternoon opening lacked maintenance and was violently pressed to a low of 3,970 yuan. After entering the market, the money exchange industry, a certain bank, and gold shops came to absorb, so it recovered to 4,020 yuan at the closing. As a result, it fell by 85 yuan compared to the previous day. The total transaction was about 1,000 taels. The silver shop ornaments fell by 10 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold sharply retreated.

Once Again Entered the 4,000 Yuan Mark

Since the early morning, the price (10 taels) at the beginning was 35 yuan lower because foreign exchange reported increased, causing many sellers. The silver shop gang sold 20 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 4,070 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry frequently absorbed on behalf of customers, and the sellers did not surge, so the price gradually increased. Soon it went back to the 4,100 yuan mark. Money exchange industry did 30 taels with each other at a price of 4,110 yuan, which was the highest point of the day. After that, a certain gold shop suddenly turned to selling, so the price declined. Soon it was pressed down by 35 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 50 taels to a peer shop at a price of 4,075 yuan. Later, another money exchange industry strongly absorbed more than 100 taels, so the price once again increased to the 4,100 yuan mark. At that time, there was a sudden rumor in the market that there was peace in the Far East, and the foreign exchange US dollar was quite loose, causing the trend to turn downward again. Money exchange industry and securities gangs and silver shop gangs competed to force the market down, and customer gangs and retail investors were all watching. Before long, the price plummeted by 80 yuan. Money exchange industry sold 20 taels to the silver shop gang at a price of 4,020 yuan. Near noon, retail investors made profits and re-entered the market, so the market stabilized slightly. Gold shop bought 10 taels from the money exchange industry at 4,040 yuan, the closing price at noon yesterday. Because the money exchange industry was quite willing to sell in the afternoon, and at one time buyers were watching, the price was violently pressed down by 70 yuan. The money exchange industry sold 30 taels to the gold shop at a price of 3,970 yuan. Later, retail investors absorbed at a low price, so the price gradually recovered. Before long, it rose by 50 yuan. The money exchange industry did 20 taels with each other at a price of 4,020 yuan. Soon it fell by 15 yuan. Securities gang sold 20 taels to the gold shop at a price of 4,005 yuan. Later, a certain bank came to absorb slightly and raised the price slightly. A certain bank bought 30 taels from the money exchange industry at 4,020 yuan, the closing price last night. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the market, and the current standard gold was 65 yuan lower than the listed gold. There were few transactions.

Silver Shop Ornaments Hung at 10 Yuan Lower

The silver shop ornaments were exchanged at 415 yuan per tael at the beginning of the day. At 12:18, the price was lowered by 5 yuan. At 2:10 PM, it was lowered by another 5 yuan. It is estimated that the price was 405 yuan for the large same-trade shops and 403 yuan for the new same-trade shops. The price for buying back decreased by about 20 yuan.

British Pound Turned Firm and Pure Gold Fell Sharply

London, 29th Dispatch: British pure gold retreated sharply because the news of the extension of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty was heard. Therefore, the British pound turned firm, and many long positions sold hard, causing it to retreat by 4 shillings per ounce, which was 7 pounds 17 shillings. Therefore, the Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price also retreated to 1,281 yuan 4 jiao. The listed customs gold also retreated by 0.069 yuan, estimated at 2 yuan 5 jiao 3.2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 32.5 yuan, estimated at 1,276 yuan 7 jiao.

### Securities: Bullish on Domestic Bonds, Strong Interest

The securities dark market yesterday saw a gradual increase in activity. The market appeared to be expanding slightly, with both buyers and sellers being relatively active. As a result, general sentiment was mostly upward. Given the significant fluctuations in market prices and the cooling weather, there was a proposal to switch to full-day trading. The market was filled with an atmosphere of peace, with talk of Britain and America being entrusted to mediate. Consequently, market prices were stable in the morning but surged in the afternoon, with trading becoming increasingly lively. A major player with a long-standing reputation in the government bond market also exerted extra effort to buy. Gold dealers also became increasingly interested. Sellers were mostly bulls taking profits, with some re-entering the market after selling. In the morning, buying focused on Dingkang, Lianyi, Yongkang, and Hongkang, while in the afternoon, Tongkang, Defu, and No. 25 were strong. Sellers were retail investors taking profits in the morning and Runli bulls exiting in the afternoon. The trend was dominated by bullish momentum. As a result, at the end of the day, except for Ding, which saw a slight drop in the afternoon due to not opening, all other categories rose by one to one dollar and twenty cents. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 1.5 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below:

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Chinese Securities Exchange were traded at a price of 24.5 yuan.

Furthermore, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that yesterday's stock market sentiment was generally more cheerful, which clearly resonated with the overnight gains in major markets in London and New York. Although the scope of trading was not large, price increases were widespread, indicating that bulls were not eager to liquidate their positions hastily. The next day or two will be a crucial stage for the European dispute's resolution. If war can be avoided, we anticipate significant progress in the market situation, as the situation in this port has eased from tension to relaxation, and there is a possibility of improved relations among the powers in China. This trend is likely inevitable.

London British Far East Company Stocks: On the 29th of this month (Wednesday), the listed market showed slight improvement. Kailan Mining unregistered shares rose 9 pence to 13 shillings and 3 pence. Gula Kelin Rubber shares rebounded 7.5 pence to 16 shillings and 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

London Chinese Foreign Bonds: On the 29th of this month (Tuesday), the listed market was stagnant, with bids but no offers. Listed prices on the upside showed slight increases. Anglo-German continuation (English issue) rose £4 to £45. Sino-French US dollars rose £6 to £38. Anglo-French (English issue) and Reorganization (English issue) each rose £3, to £43 and £28 respectively. Chrisp continuation rose £1.5 to £20. Vickers-Vimy loan rose £1 to £10. Railway bonds on the downside saw minimal changes. Longhai Railway loan rose £3 to £12. Huguang Railway (non-German issue) fell £1 to £12. The rest remained stable.

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Yangzhou Hemp on the Market, Price Opens at 25 Yuan

For new miscellaneous grains, white sesame seeds were put on the market over the past two days, totaling over 70 packages from Yangzhou. Although the harvest this year is not perfect in the Jiangbei area, it cannot be considered a poor harvest either. The output is still acceptable, but the seeds are slightly thin and contain heavy mud and ash. Prices opened at 25 yuan for the past two days, distributed by this street. The market situation is still stable. It is said that fewer large shipments will arrive in the near future. Other soybeans show a potential for a firm yet flexible situation. Broad beans are turning from prosperity to decline. Yesterday, due to sudden wind and rain, trading in the market was scarce, with only 590 packages of soybeans, over 600 packages of broad beans, and 300 packages of corn being traded.

### Food: Out-of-Town Merchants Seek Quick Sales, Rice Prices Drop Again by About 2 Yuan

Du Geng: Yesterday, due to the wind and rain, no supplies arrived from various sources. There were also very few cart packages, only over 2,000 packages. However, the market decline continued, as market goods were plentiful and out-of-town merchants rarely visited due to the wind and rain. Moreover, seeing the continuous sharp decline in the market in recent days, their sentiment was disheartened. Apart from local shops making slight purchases, there were few new entries. Therefore, sales were quiet, and the market was filled with inventory, resulting in oversupply. Out-of-town merchants sought to sell quickly to avoid losses, but the lower the prices, the more pessimistic the sentiment. As a result, various Geng and Chenxin prices fell again by about 2 yuan. Gaoxi Geng opened at 33 yuan and closed at 29 yuan. Su Tongkun Geng at 30 yuan and 29 yuan. Early and late rice from Hebei at 28 yuan, original package at 30 yuan and 29 yuan. Chen Wu Jian from 30 yuan to 27 yuan, new Jian at 24 yuan, Gaoxin Jian from Jiangbei at 27 yuan to 25 yuan. Jiashan Xin Chuan Jian at 24 yuan, Xin Yang Jian from 26 yuan to 25.5 yuan, Du Jian at 25.5 yuan, Bian Yuan not opened. Total transaction volume for the city was estimated at over 3,000 packages.

Ke Xian: Although the number of carts arriving yesterday was slightly reduced, the sellers' sentiment was weak, and they were all eager to sell. New Xian and low-priced damp rice from various regions were sold at reduced prices. However, buyers feared further price drops and had no need for them. The market was again in a state of oversupply, with both new and old Xian seeing a further drop of about 2 yuan. Special Ke Xian was only 28-29 yuan, Jue Xin Xian was only 13.5 yuan, and coarse Xian Jue was as low as under 20 yuan. However, sentiment has not stabilized, as it seems that the ban on Jiangbei has been lifted, and transportation to various ports along the Yangtze River may be possible, suggesting a continuous flow of future supplies.

### Flour Mill Market: Opening Down 2 Jiao, Wheat Stagnant

Flour: Trading in spot flour continued to be sluggish. Since the decline in returned goods, mill prices have struggled to remain stable. Yesterday, with the further decline in rice prices, more return cargo bills flowed out of the market. Actual sales relied solely on scattered purchases from this street. North-South out-of-town sales were even more difficult to expect. Therefore, sentiment weakened, and various mills had to take the initiative to reduce prices. Yesterday, the No. 2 flour mill price was changed to 4.2 yuan in cash, a decrease of 2 jiao from the previous price. The total transaction volume in the city was estimated at around 20,000 bags.

Wheat: Due to the wind and rain, wheat arrivals were sharply reduced. Although the mills claimed to be connected, they focused on eating the market and intended to buy at lower prices. National demand was exhausted, so the market was stagnant. There were no formal transactions throughout the day.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Dealers Revive Yarn Sales, Double Horse Brand Stalls at High Price, Double Globe and Angel Brands are Sought After

The yarn market has turned upwards again. However, in actual transactions, Hong Kong dealers showed slight activity, selling 490 packages. However, the 20-count Double Horse yarn, which was previously actively traded, has recently seen a sudden shift in their sentiment towards apathy. According to market reports, a suspected incident occurred in Guangxi, and they were detained by the authorities. As a result, the sales momentum of Double Horse has been greatly diminished. Therefore, they are actively purchasing medium-count yarn. As a result, the selling prices of the 20-count Double Globe and Angel brands have become increasingly high. In fact, the price of Double Horse is too high. For the same factory's products, the 20-count Angel is about 100 yuan different. Judging from the current situation, it may be possible to converge in step.

In the morning, there were rumors that Hong Kong dealers had buying interest in spot yarn, and the industry unanimously raised prices. However, with prices too high, buyers were not seen. Around 9:50 am to almost 10:00 am, Guang dealers first bought 20-count Double Globe at a high price of 15 yuan. Double Horse was once shouted out randomly, but the old buyers did not support it, with the opening price being 680 yuan. After a while, it fell back by 10 yuan, but the prices of other yarns did not move. The price fell to 665 yuan in the middle of the day, and then rebounded again at the close. The transaction volume for the half-day was counted at 1,075 packages. The market conditions were that 20-count Double Horse rose by 10 yuan, and Angel Double Globe rose by 20 yuan. The purchase volume of each dealer is as follows: Hong Kong 490, Mainland 70, Counterparts 515, Total 1,075

### New Cotton: Spot Cotton Mills Wait and See

Spot cotton trading has completely stalled. As new cotton will soon be available in large quantities, factories are all waiting and seeing and not making purchases. Although there have been strong tides and storms recently, coastal cotton fields have certainly been affected. Other parts have not suffered significant damage. The first batch of Tonghua cotton arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday was priced at 109 yuan and sold out. Today, due to the hurricane in Shanghai, shipping from northern Jiangsu has been suspended, and no goods have arrived. No spot cotton trading has taken place.

Another report: The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. Various counterparts are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the situation. Although trading is quiet, the cotton prices are unusually high. Recently, due to the high price of customs gold, the cotton tax has increased by more than 5 jiao per dan. Therefore, the counterparts are quite firm in their intentions.

Foreign Cotton Price Adjustment: The New York cotton market was relatively active yesterday as the European situation eased slightly. The market initially surged by more than 10 pounds due to purchases by overseas cotton merchants. Later, the market weakened slightly due to selling by southern dealers in the market and the liquidation of some bullish positions. As a result, the closing price was still up 12-13 pounds compared to the previous day. India was closed yesterday, and today's forecast is not much different from yesterday's closing price. Egypt fell 7-8 pounds, and Liverpool fell more than 10 pence.

### Piece Goods: Prices of Coarse and Fine Twill Fabrics Decline, Transactions are Also Quiet

National Cloth

Yesterday, due to the hurricane, there was no business in the street shops, and out-of-town sales were even more sluggish. Very few new transactions were booked, as the market was weak and buyers were increasingly cautious. Therefore, only the white cloth market saw slight changes, with fine cloth and fine twill falling by 2-3 jiao per piece, and coarse cloth and coarse twill falling by 1-2 jiao. Wholesale shops in this street made slight purchases of 40-50 pieces. However, as it was the end of the month, order deliveries were slightly busier than usual. However, the remaining balance of orders for this month was small, far from the boom of the previous months.

Eastern Piece Goods

Yesterday, white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill saw slight activity from the northern Liaohuangdao dealers. Local counterparts also made some purchases to cover short positions as the end of the month approached. Therefore, the total transaction volume for the day reached 600-700 pieces. The market price was shouted up by 1-2 jiao per piece. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth spot goods required 17.8 yuan, and Baby fine twill spot goods were priced at 16.25 yuan, and warehouse bills at 16.1 yuan.

### Smooth and Thick Woolen Cloth Transactions are Smooth

Yesterday, there was demand for smooth and thick woolen cloth from out-of-town dealers. Local old goods dealers and overcoat workshops also made new purchases, resulting in a brisk market. Large wholesalers opened briskly, with many shipments to foreign firms. Lower-end goods were even more popular, and standard market prices rose sharply again. 707 rose to 6 yuan net, and 1080 rose to 5.6 yuan net. There was not much inventory among counterparts, as Polish spot merchants had also sold out. Due to foreign exchange rates, new goods have mostly telegraphed for slow loading. Occasionally, a small number of imports are at a cost of about 7 yuan per yard. Therefore, wholesalers are now uniformly shouting for 7 yuan per piece.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Telegrams Return Slightly, Association's Prices Remain High

According to London telegrams yesterday, the sugar market for December was 6 shillings 0.75, slightly 2.25 pence, for March next year 6 shillings and 0.75 pence, slightly 2 pence, for June 6 shillings and 2 pence, slightly 2.25 pence. The association's prices in this city, spot 24th grade coarse white warehouse was 43.2 yuan, up half a yuan, foreign warehouse was 43 yuan, up 8 jiao, re-export was still 33 yuan. Taikoo car white east warehouse B brand rose 5 jiao to 7 jiao, initially 47 yuan, later rose to 47.2 yuan, west warehouse rose 2 jiao, to 47.2 yuan, also tightened later, CW brand 46.9 yuan, CX brand 46.6 yuan, DY brand 46.2 yuan, HX brand 46 yuan, H brand car red 30.6 yuan, Dutch red spot rose 7 jiao, to 40.3 yuan, re-export rose half a yuan, to 33.5 yuan. Native cotton white and No. 1 ice sugar were unchanged. The trend of national sugar remains firm, with no transactions.

### North and South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Rise Due to Poor Harvest

Black melon seeds have recently risen steadily in price as the producing areas have been flooded and the harvest has been greatly reduced. According to reports, Ji Kui seeds have risen to 44 yuan. The local market has also followed closely. Yesterday, Haizhou seeds were heard at 35 yuan for 100 packages, Linhuai seeds at 32 yuan for 43 packages, Baoying seeds at 38 yuan for over 70 packages, Tongcheng seeds at 40 yuan for 50-60 packages, and ordinary Ji Kui seeds at 40 yuan to 42 yuan for over 20 packages.

### New Hainan Dried Longan: Market Price Returns Slightly by 5 Yuan

The number of new batches of Hainan dried longan arriving after the opening of the new season was relatively large, and the market price has loosened slightly. Therefore, the market price has to drop slightly to cater to sales. The previous market dropped by 5 yuan, selling at 105 yuan. If the number of arrivals is not large in the future, then this price should be able to stand temporarily.

### Medicinal Materials: Galangal Arrives Sparsely, Stocks are Thin, Selling Price Rises by 10 Yuan

Galangal previously sold at 33 yuan. Recently, as the source has been cut off, the local reserves have become even more empty. Therefore, sellers have tightened their grip and are unwilling to release it easily. 10 packages were traded the day before yesterday at a price of 43 yuan, a rise of 10 yuan. If the outbound route is smooth, it is expected to continue to rise.

### Coal: White Coal Arrives

Due to the tense situation in Europe, there are fears that once war breaks out, shipping will be obstructed, affecting supply of imported white coal. Sentiment is anticipating shortages, and the market is strong. However, according to recent observations, this is inaccurate. In addition to the continuous arrival of Hongji white coal, the Willie ship recently loaded over 3,000 tons of Mark white coal from French territory and stacked it in concessions. Counterparts are dismantling and selling it. Lump coal is 95 yuan per ton, and the dock handling fee is added to the truck.

### Hardware: White Iron Pipes and Radiator Pipes are Too Expensive, Sales are Stagnant

White Iron Pipes: Transactions have decreased greatly recently, because the market is too high, and merchants are waiting and seeing and not making purchases. Although the local waterworks cannot lack this product, the number of purchases is also decreasing. However, due to the tight exchange rate, the opening price has risen by 2-3 jiao to 1-2 yuan from before. Currently, 4 fen is selling for 7 jiao 8 fen per foot, 6 fen for 8 jiao 8 fen, 1 inch for 1.2 yuan, 1 inch 4 fen for 1.65 yuan, 2 inches for 2.8 yuan, and 3 inches for 5 yuan.

Radiator Pipes: The railway and local construction are booming, but out-of-town locations have greatly reduced. The biggest impact is also the high price. Although there are scattered sales in the shops, the numbers are not wide. Currently, such as 1 inch 4 fen is selling at 2.25 yuan per foot, 2 inches at 3.2 yuan, and 2 inches 5 fen at 4.7 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Italian Artificial Silk Arrives in Shanghai

240 pieces of Italian artificial silk were shipped by the Italian ship Rulian Gai Sa (transliteration), which arrived on the 28th of the previous day. Only 90 pieces of this artificial silk were for this city, and the remaining 150 pieces were transferred to Tianjin. It is reported that the ship also carried over 300 boxes of woolen cloth. There are also 10 pieces of artificial silk shipped to Hong Kong.

### On "Hiding" in the Literary World (Part 2)

— Qin Lao

Judging from this historical development, our current movement of literary figures reviving pseudonyms is naturally a further step of "progress."

It is not difficult to describe the characteristics of this further "progress."

First of all, the nature of the current movement is much more complex. Although writers using pseudonyms in the first period bore the burden of "theft," judging from the tone of the opponents, as long as they did not use pseudonyms, the pejorative could be withdrawn. Although the methods of opponents in the second period were terrifying, writers using pseudonyms who were truly angered and wrote their real names would immediately suffer great losses. However, what the opponents did on the surface was still the same old tune. If you ignored them, they still had no way to deal with you. But the current situation is different. Our literary figures scold you for "hiding" and being lowly and dirty, and will definitely give you a terrible label. The effect is: If you are angered and write your real name, you are a sinner, and if you continue to use a pseudonym, you are still guilty. In short, they want to prevent you from escaping. This meticulous "legal net" is truly admirable.

Secondly, the current literary figures not only do not have the stupidity of their ancestors in the first period, but are also smarter than their ancestors in the second period. Although the anti-pseudonym advocates in the first period later began to use pseudonyms themselves, they were all true to their names and did not change their surnames. The anti-pseudonym advocates in the second period were also somewhat stupid in this regard. In order to scold others, they were still willing to reveal their true faces. But the current situation is different. Our literary figures, while scolding others for "hiding," are actually "hiding" themselves, and the more fiercely they scold, the faster their "hiding" skills become. This is just like detectives catching "reactionaries": Those who are caught have to disguise themselves in order to defend themselves, while those who catch them scold them for being cunning, but disguise themselves even more severely. This approach is also worthy of admiration.

With this further "progress," our literary figures righteously shout to those who use pseudonyms: "Come out! If you are a hero, come out!"

But will anyone really "come out"? I don't think so.

Because "coming out" or not "coming out" is the same as being a sinner, it is better to simply "hide" more securely and not "come out." Also, seeing that the person shouting for you to "come out" is wearing European medieval armor, wrapped in iron pieces, only revealing two eyes, and yet wants you to learn from modern swimmers, appearing naked, just thinking about it, it is still better not to "come out." — In a word: There are no such fools in the world.

From this perspective, writers will probably continue to "hide," and even with our enthusiastic literary figures, it is feared that it will be difficult to reverse this decline. The literary world will ultimately be difficult to have a "bright day." Alas!

### About Teeth

— Cao Xiqin Ke, translated by Luo Hong

Our friend, Aige Liji, has some tooth problems. Those teeth are starting to loosen.

Of course, time is very important for this type of ailment. When you get old, the so-called natural mechanism of the teeth is destroyed, the tendons and bones become weak, and the teeth become useless.

When Ivan Aige Liji Shasazhi Fu lived with me last year, he started losing his teeth late.

The first tooth was indeed knocked out during an argument with someone. The other teeth fell out on their own for no reason. For example, sometimes he was eating something and it would fall out, sometimes he was discussing the issue of high and low wages and the tooth would break into pieces, and sometimes he was alone and the tooth would explode. This is really the strangest thing. In a short period of time, he lost six teeth.

But Aige Liji didn't care much. He wasn't afraid of becoming a toothless person. He had insurance. If he needed it, he could immediately have his teeth put back in. He was very proud of this plan and often said:

"I'm not stingy about teeth at all. If they fall out, I can make them grow back. I don't want anyone touching my nose or anywhere on my face, but I don't care about teeth. I'm not worried. We insured people are very safe."

So when Aige Liji lost six teeth, he decided to make his first repair decision. He took his insurance policy and took a small car to the provincial dental hospital.

The consulting physicians were very happy to receive him.

"Of course," they said. "We can fix them for you with a metal tray. So how many have you lost? According to the regulations of our insurance charter, it does not take effect until you have lost eight teeth. If you lose eight or more teeth, that's your good fortune and our misfortune. If you haven't lost eight, we can't do anything for you. Dentists can't waste time on these trivial matters. The charter stipulates this number for insurance."

"I lost six," Aige Liji told them.

"We're very sorry," they said,

"We can't do anything for you now, friend. Just let it be. Wait. If you're lucky, as long as two or three more fall out, we can fix them."

Aige Liji was very angry.

"What? Do you want me to knock them out? Why?"

"Of course you don't need to knock them out," they said. "Just let it take its course. You wait. If you're lucky, as long as two or three more fall out, we can fix them."

Returning home from the dental hospital, he was very emotional. He understood about teeth. Now everything was unexpectedly complicated.

He hoped that the extra two or three teeth would fall out quickly.

One fell out quickly. Aige Liji sometimes played with filing the other one smooth. Of course, the tooth quickly fell out of the tooth socket.

Aige Liji immediately rushed to the dental hospital.

"Now," he said, "The conditions of the regulations are all met—I have lost eight teeth."

"That's great," they told him. "Now we can work for you. Are those teeth that fell out in the same position? Because according to our charter, eight teeth must fall out in a row. If they are not in the same position, then we still can't do anything. We still can't handle eight teeth falling out in different places. Of course, you understand that if the teeth that fall out are not in a row, then you can still chew things!"

"They did not fall out in the same position," Aige Liji said.

"Then sorry, we can't do anything."

Poor Aige Liji had nothing to say. He could only clench his remaining teeth and angrily walked out of the dental hospital.

What a disappointment. He could only live with his fate, and all hope was swept away.

From then on, Aige Liji changed his lifestyle. He lived very quietly, only eating liquid food, and brushing his teeth three times a day.

Under such caution, the regulations of the dental hospital had very good results.

### Should I Remove It?

### Underground Fire (Book Review)

— Yang Fei

"Underground Fire" is a "full-length reportage" depicting "illegal activities" under the Nazi swastika.

The author, the German Liepmann (H.LiePmann), "is not a socialist, nor a member of any political party," and according to him, "he himself does not have a definite political belief": However, at that time, he was working as a correspondent for an American newspaper, and at the same time he "believed that a writer should be a moral person," so he not only carefully investigated the truth of various events under Nazi rule and reported them correctly, but also gave deep sympathy to those arduous and heroic "slapped" party members, and tried his best to help the establishment and activities of "illegal organizations."

Liepmann's sense of justice is not only on his lips, but also hidden in his actions. And this is precisely what gives him the convenience of collecting secret news, enabling his understanding to penetrate from the surface to the inside, and making his reports more detailed and true.

In "Underground Fire," the beginning describes the Nazis burning the Reichstag to frame the communists for arson, and then suppressing the freedom of the people, capturing and killing their political opponents, and manipulating the election under bayonets to seize the power of dictatorship: Therefore, socialists turned to underground activities, and under the spider web of secret agents and military police, they were repeatedly smashed and failed, but regrouped three times to fight. Rascals became important officials, traitors were promoted, and some became members of the SS in order to raise marriage expenses; on the other hand, in unemployment and poverty, they carried out propaganda for their beliefs, planned riots, and engaged in anti-tyranny work. In such an atmosphere, relatives became enemies, couples turned against each other, and lovers became foes. However, revolutionaries risked danger and endured sacrifices in order to stir up the "underground fire"!

Conspiracy, terror, tension, tragedy, decisiveness, bravery—these are not legends, but all facts. Liepmann uses multi-faceted narratives to show the inner workings of the two forces in power and in opposition, and to reveal the origins of many events of high pressure and hard struggle, which are the result of his not taking trouble to investigate in all directions and personally participating in the work. He contacted the leaders and party groups of the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Socialist Youth League, etc., and also contacted Hitler's special envoys, Nazi spies, and SS members; he ran into the masses, secret rooms, and also entered the police department and prisons. These real experiences and insights became the rich and accurate materials for his writing.

In this book, there is no exaggerated description, nor imaginary supplements—these are more appropriate to put in novels—and this is "a bloody record." It writes about thugs, but does not write each one like a beast, some of them are also influenced by revolutionaries: it writes about heroes, but does not write each one like a god, they also often encounter dangers and change color in fright. This is a tragic human drama, "every thing is a fact obtained after detailed investigation," but it does indeed make people feel tragic when reading it.

Liepmann's writing is also very concise and skillful. He often inserts some seemingly accidental joints in the front of the book, and later the development of the facts is connected with those joints; this kind of "echoing" method is particularly thrilling, and it is also more "realistic." For some events, he did not add much descriptive explanation, but has already hinted at their causal relationship. That kind of bookkeeping-style tedious and wasteful writing is not there.

It is hoped that the authors of reportage in our country can pay attention to this writing attitude and technique.

This book now has a Chinese translation, translated by Zhu Wen. Zhu Wen's translation is fluent and smooth, worthy of the name of a masterpiece, a good translation.

### Tianjin Flood Zhang Eyun Encounters Misfortune

— Shui Yan

Chen Shaolin Returns to Beiping by Tub

The flood in Tianjin has been heard in this city for a long time, and Zhang Eyun, Chen Shaolin, Ye Sheng’lan, Wang Shi’ying, Hou Xi’rui, Ma Fu’lu and others, who were performing at the Chinese Grand Theater in the French Concession of Tianjin, also encountered this disaster. On August 20, when the play "The Heavenly River Match" was nearing its end, with the seven-sentence verses being sung, water suddenly poured in, leveling with the stage. All the actors were terrified, and fled to the Huizhong Hotel. But the water was already reaching the roof, so Ye Sheng’lan and six others immediately hired a small boat at the price of twenty yuan per person. They took the boat to the railway station that day, and took a train back to Beiping in a state of disarray. Because the boat was small and crowded, the famous beards player Chen Shaolin couldn’t get on the boat in time, so he switched to a wooden tub, with two good swimmers to help row, and finally floated to the station, returning to Beiping at risk, which can also be said to be fortunate. It is heard that the famous female performer Zhang Eyun also fled to the roof with the crowd at that time, but because things happened suddenly, everyone was only concerned with escaping for their lives, and no one cared about her. When everyone hired a boat, Eyun was still on the top of the roof. Whether she is in mortal danger is still unknown, but the food is gone. Zhang Ling’s life is in danger!

### Molière Has Good Luck

— Xi Tong

The great French comedy writer Molière has recently had good luck in Shanghai. Various drama troupes have successively staged his old man's plays, and they have all put Chinese costumes on them. The first is the "Pretentious Ladies" of the Sino-French Theater, which is a satire on the salon atmosphere in France at that time. After Mr. Feng Zhizhong changed it, it turned to mocking the milk-drinking poets of our country. Then there is the "Tartuffe" of the New Performance Theater, which satirizes religious hypocrites. Originally, the Sino-French Theater also wanted to perform "Ideal Wife" and set the background in Wuxi. Recently, the Pudong Building Xuan Palace Theater has also staged Molière's "The Miser". This is the "The Miser" translated by Gao Zhenchang before, adapted by Gu Zhongyi and Guang Sheng.

Mr. Li Jianwu compared "The Miser" with Zheng Tingyu's "The Skinflint," which is quite insightful. There are many similar dramas and legends, such as One Wen Money Luo Meng. It is common to combine great drinking, love, greed, and anger into four dramas. The so-called greed describes misers. In terms of diction and structure, Molière likes white painting, which is not compatible with those who liked gorgeous diction at that time; his dramas are all laughter-inducing. This point is quite similar to Li Yu and Shen Qifeng in our country, and the times are very close. The difference is that Chinese comedy focuses on fame and fortune, talented scholars and beautiful women, and has no enlightenment on life: Molière mercilessly stripped off the clothes of the general goblins, making them nakedly exposed, so almost none of Molière's dramas do not cause trouble. Everyone thought that Molière was scolding themselves, so they attacked in groups. Even if Louis X called bodyguards, it was useless. When he died later, he could only hold a funeral secretly.

Molière has a wealth of stage experience, and the effect of "The Miser" is good. It can indeed cause laughter from the audience.

In terms of important actors, such as Zheng Zhong, Wu Ming, Shen Min, Zhou Qi, etc., are all very successful. The most noteworthy is the final decision to marry. Everyone advocated saving the marriage expenses and donating them to the country. As soon as the words were spoken, the audience applauded, which shows the enthusiasm of the Shanghai people for loving the country.

### Miss Yu Sulian Talks About Stage Life and Aspirations (Continued)

— Leng Fang's notes

Favorite plays

When I was in the "Carlton" troupe, I would haphazardly play almost all kinds of roles, such as young male, clown, and supporting characters, except for painted faces. Since joining "Golden," I have specialized in playing old plays. I have performed the Hua Shan plays the most, but when I was invited to play flat roles, I would often play the Qingyi roles. Generally speaking: My favorite plays are the Qingyi plays such as "Teaching the Son," "Sacrificing to the River," and "Sacrificing to the Pagoda," which are bitter plays, and the Hua Shan plays like "Flower Field Wrong," "Making a Scene at School," and "Playing Cherry," where I play the little maid. Because the bitter plays are poignant and moving, and full of genuine emotion; the little maid's role is natural to perform a naive and lively mood, and I can give full play to it without any affectation: In other words, this kind of play is also very suitable for my age, and perhaps it will not be very suitable after a few years.

Daily life

The daily life can be said to be accustomed to mechanization: I get up at seven in the morning, and then the two Qin masters pull the erhu to warm up my voice for an hour. From nine to ten o'clock, I practice work - running around the field and the martial arts used in the Dao Ma Dan plays. In the afternoon, I learn Kunqu opera for an hour, and in the evening, I go to a nearby tutoring school to study Central English for two hours. However, if there are day plays or rehearsals of new plays, this afternoon course cannot be taken care of and often has to be abandoned.

The only wish

My only wish is to go to Beiping to learn plays from various teachers and strive for further study, which has been my wish for several years. Since leaving "Carlton" last year, my mind has been full of the idea of going to the north; at present, although the "Golden" authorities are still firmly unwilling to let me go, I am always thinking about it and determined to plan to go north to find a teacher as soon as possible to complete this wish. The planned plan is to go there for two years, still half-work, half-advise, singing plays on the one hand and learning plays on the other. Because the custom in northern theaters is that they usually perform only two or three times a week; even if I want to join a troupe, it will not hinder the work of learning plays at all.

Finally, I think that most people's eyes look at us play actors as lower than ordinary occupations, which is really unfair; there are many people in our play industry who have the same high level of thinking and personality, and it is inevitable that we will be subject to such erroneous discrimination, which is a great regret!

### Paramount Grand Theater

Will stand in Jing'an Temple

Since the Paramount Shopping Mall was erected at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road on the side of Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai, the market has become more prosperous, but the film theaters for entertainment are still lacking. Now I have learned that Mr. Yang Cunguo, the general manager of Paramount Shopping Mall, plans to build the Paramount Grand Theater next to the Paramount Ballroom. The theater site covers an area of more than two mu, enough for more than a thousand seats. All the equipment is the latest type in the Far East. The theater is also equipped with hot and cold machines. The rest, such as the projector, sound machine, screen lighting, etc., are all perfect. It is heard that the design of the theater has been approved by the central management authorities, and construction will begin soon.

### Shanghai Drama Society　Revives "Tears Splashed on Flowers"

"Tears Splashed on Flowers" was staged three times at Carlton and Xin Guang last year. This time, the Shanghai Drama Society is said to have the intention of reviving "Tears Splashed on Flowers." And it is a four-act complete performance. According to the already announced original cast, it is very strong. For example, Chang Hai Cai played by Mo Yan, and Xiao Li played by Xu Li are very excellent. Tu Guangqi, who played Ni Yanqing successfully in "Drowning Abyss," will certainly not be weak to play Jin Shiyin. Xia Xia's Ding Xiang and Lan Lan's Mi Mi are naturally good.

It is said that "Tears Splashed on Flowers" will be performed from September 1. The director of the play is still the film director Wu Yonggang. He is the old director of "Tears Splashed on Flowers." Mr. Wu also directed the first performance. Then this time, "striving for perfection," the results can certainly be guaranteed.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Newly Built Theaters Have Superstitions Such as Opening the Door and Breaking the Stage

Most of the people who are theater owners in the interior are relatively prestigious figures in Anqing. The actors of the Jianghu troupe must also have this threshold, so that they will not suffer a big loss. Cao, the owner of the Yunlong Stage, is also a senior member of Anqing. At that time, he hooked up with the old actor Meng Xieqing and Meng's high apprentice Shan Deyuan. Xieqing privately learned from the famous net Huang Runfu, and his singing and white skills were very experienced. In addition to the supporting net, he was also good at martial arts and had many Guan operas. However, he was very old-fashioned and superstitious. According to the usual practice of the Pear Garden, "Do not read Geng (Geng changed to continue Jing) on the stage, and do not talk about dreams under the stage." Therefore, whenever he met someone surnamed Meng (dream and Meng have the same sound), everyone would call him "Huang Liangzi." (Based on the saying "Huang Liang One Dream") Xieqing's surname is Meng, if someone asks him his name, he will give you a string of five words "Huang Liangzi Xieqing". If you are a layman and express surprise after hearing this, then he would rather write the word Meng for you to see, but he will never say "Meng". When he first arrived at the theater, he saw that it was originally a house built on a sandy beach. This place was originally the old course of the Yellow River. When there were many rains in summer and autumn, the entire theater would be completely submerged in water. He thought this was a bit strange. The name of the garden is "Yunlong". In the season of water, the dragon is of course comfortable in the water, but the play does not need to be sung, which is equivalent to closing the door. If it is in spring and winter, there is no water around the theater. The play is of course performed, but "the dragon is trapped on the beach, and the tiger falls on the plain." These are all unlucky idioms. How could a good Yunlong Stage be built on the beach? Isn't this too ignorant? (90)
