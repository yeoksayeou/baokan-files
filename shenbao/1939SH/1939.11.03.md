### Military Affairs Commission Releases Weekly Battle Situation; October 25th to 31st

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that since this week (October 25th to 31st), battles have continued to unfold on all fronts, with those north of the Yellow River being relatively fierce. In particular, the large-scale movements of Japanese troops in Western Shanxi have suffered a major blow under strong Chinese resistance, and the Japanese attempts to invade have been completely crushed. Victories have also been achieved on other fronts. The more important aspects of the combat are described below:

Shanxi-Henan Front: Huguan in Southeastern Shanxi is still closely besieged by the Chinese. The strongholds of Fucheng, Hecuan, and Guxianzhen have also been successively recaptured. Three to four thousand Japanese troops in the Quwo, Houma, and Wenxi areas of Southern Shanxi took advantage of artillery cover on the 26th and 27th to attack Nanfanzhen, Anyucun, Nanguocun, and other places, but were met with a head-on attack. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and failed to succeed. The main force of the Japanese Taniguchi Division in Western Shanxi has for days attacked Lvliang Mountain along three routes: Puxian, Lingshi, and Fencheng. At the same time, troops from Taigu, Pingyao, and other places were sent south to reinforce them. The Chinese army has laid a close siege, cutting the Japanese into several segments and attacking them separately in the valleys of Kuanhejing south of Jixian, Canjialing west of Xiangning, Daning, and Gekou. The Japanese left wing, the Saeki Battalion, and two units of the Pu Regiments in the central route all suffered heavy losses. The right wing, the Mikuchi Regiment, was no longer a cohesive unit. All these places have been completely recaptured. The defeated and wounded Japanese troops are struggling desperately, and fierce fighting is ongoing. The Chinese army has also recaptured Doucunzhen, part of Wutai in Northern Shanxi, killing over five hundred Japanese troops. As for the Japanese troops in Bo'ai and Qinyang in Southern Henan, they launched separate attacks on Baimahui and Xikaizhen, but were repulsed by the Chinese army. In recent days, the Chinese army in Eastern Henan has launched a multi-pronged attack, and the Japanese troops in Huaiyang and Kaifeng have now been forced to the outskirts of Huaiyang and once charged to the South Gate of Kaifeng, achieving many victories.

Shandong-Hebei Front: Over three thousand Japanese troops in Xintai, Laiwu, and other places in Southern Shandong launched a counter-offensive against the Chinese army on the 25th from Lucun, Xionggui, and Kuangrui, resulting in extremely fierce fighting. Chinese officers and soldiers bravely charged into the Japanese formation, recapturing the village and continuing to recapture Zhuangshimeng, Jiuxian, and other places, pressing towards Laiwu County. The Chinese army in Eastern Hebei has for days been attacking the Japanese troops in Yunhua and Hunjie, killing over a hundred Japanese troops. The war is now in a stalemate. The Japanese troops in Datun have been attacked by the Chinese regiment for many days. The Japanese have made several unsuccessful attempts to break through. This week, they launched another reinforced counterattack, but were killed in countless numbers. The Japanese troops in Datun have all retreated, and the area has been recaptured. Another unit of the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to attack the Japanese troops in Jixian and Nangong in Southern Hebei. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese position was shaken and they are currently holding on while awaiting reinforcements. (To be continued)

### Key Points of Japanese Policy Towards Supporting Wang Jingwei

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reports that Japan's attitude and policy towards the "new Chinese regime" about to be organized by Wang Jingwei are to immediately grant it de facto recognition, not to interfere in China's internal affairs, and to establish a Sino-Japanese Economic Conference to promote a closer economic alliance between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." Japan's basic policy for resolving the China situation is to realize a "New Order in East Asia" through both construction and warfare. The key points of Japan's policy towards the Wang regime are as follows: (1) Japan will provide unlimited assistance to Wang Jingwei's preparations for the establishment of a "New Central Government of China" and expects it to be established soon. (2) Japan, from the standpoint of respecting China's sovereignty, anticipates the smooth and automatic development of an independent and free China. (3) Japan pays special attention to the political organization of the new regime. Japan especially wants the special characteristics of North China and Inner Mongolia to finally be realized. (4) When the new government is established, Japan is prepared to immediately recognize it de facto and send an ambassador plenipotentiary. (5) Japan will then seek the adjustment and harmonization of Sino-Japanese relations in politics, economics, and culture. (6) Regarding internal affairs, culture, education, etc., the Japanese government is willing for the new government to pursue its own independent policies, but the Japanese government will not hesitate to provide any assistance or cooperation when needed. (7) From this standpoint, the Japanese government will absolutely avoid any form of assistance that could give the impression of Japanese interference in China's internal affairs, such as assigning political advisors. (8) However, Japan is prepared to send a financial advisor to China if the new government so desires. (9) In the field of natural sciences and civil engineering, Japan is prepared to provide technical and personnel assistance upon request. (10) Regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation, in order to further strengthen the economic unity of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo," it is planned to organize a Sino-Japanese Economic Conference, such as the one that currently exists between Japan and the North China Provisional Government, as a joint Sino-Japanese mechanism to implement mutual and equal economic cooperation. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: The decision of the Asia Development Board yesterday regarding the new Chinese regime was not submitted to the cabinet today. However, this matter needs to be handled quickly, so the government has decided to convene a special cabinet meeting on Saturday morning. After the cabinet approves this decision, Prime Minister Abe will enter the Imperial Palace to request the Emperor's approval. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### A Comprehensive View of Molotov's Speech

On October 31st, Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on the current international situation and the "Principles of Soviet Foreign Policy" at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The abundance of its content and the weight of its substance are rarely seen in speeches by authorities of various countries on international issues in recent years. Reading his words and looking to the future, one will deeply feel that "the ideas and actions of the Soviet Union are truly elusive." However, the various actions of the Soviet Union in the past seventy years have already been deeply etched in the hearts and minds of the world. Now, with this comprehensive speech by its authorities, it is akin to having a skilled photographer take an exceptionally clear "copy;" the true face is clearly visible, and those who care about world changes and historical facts can scrutinize it carefully.

Molotov's words are worthy of attention. The value lies not in truth, for such words do not contain any truth, and hardly any truth contains such words. Its value lies in the international sphere. Soviet sages have made many contributions to the international community: in the distant past, Lenin promoted communism, which the toiling masses of the world yearn for; more recently, Litvinov interpreted the definition of aggression, which the weak and small nations of the world yearn for. All these aspirations transcend national boundaries, forming a torrent, and are highly respected by the international community. Now, Molotov's words are different in nature from the contributions of Lenin and Litvinov, and their relevance to the international community is also significant. Because in the past, the international community had completely different perceptions of the Soviet Union, and at least two of these perceptions were "serious errors:" one was the mistaken belief that Soviet policy was based on right and wrong that transcended national boundaries, which is now corrected by Molotov's explanation; that is, the Soviet Union's policy is based on the Soviet state, and for the sake of the Soviet state's "rights" and "security," its policy extends its "obligations," "open doors," and "military bases" beyond its national boundaries into other countries' national boundaries; this kind of policy has nothing to do with so-called right and wrong. The second was the mistaken belief that communism was an overriding golden rule, which is now also corrected by Molotov's explanation; that is, "Hitler's ideology is the same as any ideology." Of course, the ideology of communism is also one of any ideology, and it is not an overriding golden rule, but merely a "matter of each person's political stance;" a golden rule is solemn and sacred, supreme and unparalleled, while a political stance allows for flexibility and compromise, being relative. These two misconceptions have contributed to the international torrent for quite some time, and Molotov has corrected them. Therefore, it is said that the value of his words lies in the international sphere.

From Molotov's words, one can firmly believe that the Soviet Union has been fundamentally peaceful in the past seventy years; even in Polish territory, after "the disintegration of Poland," "a major war broke out with the Polish army," and even under the policy of peace, the Soviet Red Army suffered 2,600 casualties. However, considering the vast area of 196,000 square kilometers and the population of 13 million, the blood shed by those 2,600 people can be said to be the blood of peace. Moreover, the three small Baltic countries were able to accept the Soviet Union's peaceful policy with a peaceful attitude even before they disintegrated; this is truly a great success for the Soviet Union, which Molotov is delighted to talk about.

"The ideas and actions of the Soviet Union are truly elusive." Although Molotov repeatedly stated that "the Soviet Union will continue to consistently pursue a peaceful foreign policy," it seems that its peaceful intentions and peaceful actions can be made clear to the world and do not need to be grasped. Moreover, Molotov stated that the Soviet Union "stayed out of" this dangerous war situation, which coincides with our previous inference that the Soviet Union's basic policy was to observe the war. Continuing peace, is there any doubt? However, there are aspects that cannot be generalized. Regarding the Finnish matter, he said, "The Soviet Union had no choice but to take strict measures to ensure security," and "The Finnish government should accept our proposal, and our proposal is the minimum measure." Regarding the Turkish matter, he said, "In the future, Turkey is something we will not regret, and we will not make predictions." Following his words, he is still sharpening his knife. Where is the certainty of peace? Not only that, but does the world not remember that the day after the Soviet Union signed a border cessation of hostilities agreement with Japan, it marched into Poland? Now, Molotov's speech on European disputes only remotely presents a kissing posture towards Japan. How can we know that this enchantment of Japan is not a sign of something being done in Europe? Whether the knife is sharpened or not, whether the signs are consistent or not, manipulation is in their hands, and it is still elusive.

After hearing Molotov's speech, some people felt a sense of loss, asking why there was not a single word about China? From far away Europe and America to nearby Shanghai, they questioned each other. We have unwavering faith: the Soviet Union's current policy is clearly based on its national rights and security, as has already been said. Only a strong China will not harm the rights and security of the Soviet Union in Asia, and there will be no fear of any threats. Therefore, the Soviet Union must maintain its goodwill towards China, this is one. The Soviet Union's current diplomacy, that is, the Soviet Union's diplomacy on the day of Molotov's speech, apart from diplomatic issues related to the Soviet Union itself, mainly involves using all peaceful means to support Germany; whether it is criticizing Britain and France, satirizing the United States, threatening Turkey, or even showing goodwill to Japan, it is all for Germany; providing Germany with economic convenience and assistance, engaging in diplomatic maneuvering for Germany, seeking historical reversals for Germany, and finding theoretical bases for Germany, it uses every means to the extreme. What it does not do is shed blood for Germany; if it sheds blood, it is not for Germany but for the Soviet Union itself. Even Molotov's speech can be said to be entirely for Germany; this is the second reason. Not mentioning China is because China has never wronged Germany, and it is also because it is different from Japan, because China does not want to feign between Britain and Germany!

### Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons on the Military and Diplomatic Situation: Poor Weather Causes a Lull in the Fighting, and the Future Goals of the Soviet Union Are Worth Noting

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain recently reported to the House of Commons this afternoon on the military situation of the past week, roughly stating, "The weather has been poor in the past week, and visibility has been poor. The activities of the army, navy, and air force have all been affected. As for the army, the activities of the French and German troops have been limited to mutual shelling during local operations. Although the front lines are suffering from dampness and cold, our expeditionary forces are still able to consolidate their defense zones as quickly as possible. According to reports from all sides, our troops are very harmonious with the local residents. As for the navy, the war situation has been relatively quiet in the past week. Enemy submarines have still been sunk by our side, and our country has also lost several merchant ships, but our confidence in overcoming submarines has not been shaken in the slightest. As for the air force, German aircraft have engaged in fierce battles with our fighter jets, especially when enemy aircraft attacked our convoy of merchant ships. Our aircraft and warships have not suffered any losses, and several enemy aircraft have been shot down. Our aircraft have also flown to northwestern Germany for reconnaissance in the past week, and have taken many important photos at a low altitude of 300 feet. Although the enemy's anti-aircraft fire was densely fired in an attempt to stop it, it was ultimately ineffective." As for the international situation, although Berlin has been waiting for a long time for the speech delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday, October 31, in my opinion, Germany is now disappointed by it. The British government has carefully studied the full text of the speech, and in particular, the section on the future goals of the Soviet government is of particular concern to us. Molotov once declared in May of this year, "We stand for maintaining peace and preventing all new aggressions." The British government's position is exactly the same. Although Molotov made many imaginative remarks when interpreting the goals of the two Allied nations of Britain and France, I do not take them seriously. Our position has been clearly stated, and I believe that most countries in the world approve of it. In addition, the talks conducted by the government and representatives of the autonomous territories are sufficient to prove the determination of all parts of the British Empire and the spirit of their sincere unity. We are discussing with these representatives the adjustment methods for individual efforts to implement common tasks. How sincere the spirit of cooperation among all parts of the British Empire is, we have now made clear. After the representatives of the autonomous territories came here, we have gained a more complete understanding of the plans formulated by the governments of these autonomous territories. Its value is very great. We believe that the representatives of the governments of the autonomous territories and the government of India will take this opportunity to gain a more practical understanding of the most appropriate and rapid solutions to various common problems. This common affair is also very important. In short, all parts of the empire, including all colonies, are cooperating with us enthusiastically, and there are countless telegrams of allegiance. These telegrams are not out of our request. In other words, the government has not forced the colonies to join the war. If so many different races can automatically cooperate with us, it shows that any threat to Britain is also enough to threaten the freedom and welfare of the residents of British territories. However, in the early stages of the war, what we asked of the colonies was mainly economic assistance, and we hoped that they would transport various raw materials to Britain. The government is also willing to fully utilize the manpower of the colonies and is currently drafting concrete plans. As for the current situation, the strength of the West African Frontier Force has more than doubled, and the East African Rifles have also tripled. The number of subjects of the empire applying to volunteer for service is far beyond our needs. The subjects of all colonies and protectorates are on an equal footing with the subjects within the United Kingdom and can join the British army for service. From the above, it is not difficult to know the general nature of the assistance we can obtain from all parts of the empire." (Havas, 2nd)

### British Announce Successful Naval Escorts: 500,000 Tons of German Contraband Seized, British Ship Sunk Again by German Submarine

London: According to semi-official sources today, as of the end of October, the number of Allied merchant ships escorted by British warships was 2,500, which shows the development of the British escort system. Since the first week after the start of the war, merchant ship losses have been greatly reduced. To date, only eight of the escorted ships have been lost, accounting for only one in 200. The thoroughness of the escort system shows the large number of British escort ships. According to observers, the most effective way for Britain to protect merchant ships is still to destroy the enemy's attacking forces. Britain's measures to resist submarines are quite strong, as can be seen from the heavy losses of German submarines and their forced departure from the route. The German command's claim that the war to destroy British shipping is proceeding according to plan is considered here to be inconsistent with the facts. The losses suffered by British shipping to and from British ports are less than 1% in two months, and the construction of new ships exceeds this. The number of German ships captured by Britain is also more than the number of British ships lost. (Reuters, 2nd)

London: Minister of Economic Warfare Cross gave a broadcast speech tonight, roughly stating that since the outbreak of the war, the warships of the Allied nations of Britain and France have intercepted more than 500,000 tons of contraband bound for Germany. (Havas, 1st)

London: It is reported that the 4,000-ton British ship "Blanty" was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic. The crew of 40 and one passenger, a 71-year-old inventor, have all landed at a British port. It is reported that the "Blanty" was attacked a few days ago and floated on the surface of the sea for a long time. Another merchant ship attempted to tow it into port, but failed. (Reuters, 2nd)

Gibraltar: A radio telegram from the British ship "Elba" was recently intercepted here, claiming that the ship was attacked by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean, 240 miles east of Madeira Island, a Portuguese territory, this morning. Fortunately, it escaped and was not damaged, and is still continuing to sail. (Havas, 2nd)

New York: The British ship "Colmore" (3,670 tons) sent a distress signal yesterday in the sea 680 miles east of New York. Six U.S. Coast Guard ships and two seaplanes immediately went to the rescue, but failed to find the ship's whereabouts. People fear that the ship has been sunk. U.S. military officials here have begun to discuss whether German submarines are lurking in this area. In addition to attempting to rescue the 34 crew members on board the British ship, the U.S. authorities also want to search the area to see if there are any ships or submarines of belligerent countries. Coast Guard ships have begun to set out to search. If the location stated in the signal sent by the "Colmore" is correct, then this fact occurred within the neutral zone mentioned in the Panama Declaration of the Pan-American Conference. The naval authorities have dispatched destroyers and aircraft to assist the Coast Guard in carrying out the search. (Associated Press, 2nd)

New York: The New York Times correspondent stationed in Panama Port recently sent a telegram stating that, according to reliable sources, the German oil tanker "Friedrich" loaded 40,000 boxes of kerosene from the port of Tampico, Mexico, on the 19th of last month. After sailing out to sea, it sailed to the Caribbean Sea on the 24th and turned off all the lights on the ship. At that time, it suddenly met the British cruiser "Taspech." The captain of the cruiser immediately sent a signal asking the reason for turning off the lights. The captain of the oil tanker replied that it was because the lighting equipment was damaged. The captain of the cruiser then ordered the ship to stop. The captain of the oil tanker refused to comply on the pretext of mechanical failure. The captain of the cruiser found it strange and ordered it to stop again for inspection, and sent a team of sailors to the ship. They saw that all 40 sailors were standing next to the lifeboats. When the sailors ordered them to leave, they refused to comply. At this point, the captain of the ship came out in person and said, "We have pierced the bottom compartment, and this ship is about to sink. You should quickly lower the lifeboats." The British sailors then led all the crew members off the ship and let it sink on its own, and then sent all the crew members to British Jamaica for detention. (Havas, 2nd)

### Finnish Delegation Arrives in Moscow to Continue Negotiations with the Soviet Union: Finnish Foreign Minister Expresses Determination to Maintain Independence and Willingness to Guarantee the Security of Leningrad for the Soviet Union

Moscow: The Finnish delegation arrived here at 10:00 this morning. This is their third visit. The Director of Protocol of the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russian expert and former Minister to the Soviet Union, Hjalmar Haraldson Procopé, is also in the delegation. The Director of Protocol of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Bagov, and many officials, as well as ministers from Scandinavian countries, welcomed them at the station. (Havas, 2nd)

Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko said in a speech last night that Finland could not agree to any arrangement that would cause Finland to lose its independence and opportunity for self-defense. Finland did not see that the Finnish nation or land posed a threat to the security of the Soviet Union. If a third country attempts to use Finland as a base to attack the Soviet Union, we will resist this attempt with all our strength. Finland has announced that it is willing to help the Soviet Union strengthen the defenses of Leningrad and Finland. The Treaty of Tartu (by which Finland gained independence) and the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty should be the basis for all possible negotiations. It is reported that the Finnish cabinet decided to send a delegation to Moscow for the third time to negotiate with the Soviet government after a long discussion. The delegation carries Finland's "last word" and will arrive in Moscow today. (Reuters, 2nd)

Helsinki: Diplomatic sources here recently stated that the Soviet Union's demands on the Finnish government were originally intended to be kept secret, but have now been leaked by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The Finnish government is very dissatisfied, but has still decided to continue negotiations. The fact that it has allowed the delegation to go to Moscow shows that the delegation's instructions are sufficient as a basis for negotiations. In Finnish public opinion, however, there is unanimous opposition to ceding any land on the east and west coasts to the Soviet Union for the construction of naval bases, so as not to threaten the southern coast and the Baltic Sea transport line. On the other hand, some of the demands made by the Soviet Union to ensure the security of Leningrad can be accepted. In addition, Molotov said that a third country would exert pressure on Finland, which is surprising, because Finland initially accepted negotiations and decided to continue negotiations at this time out of its own volition and was not influenced by other countries. In short, Finland is a small country, and it is difficult to understand how it could threaten the powerful Soviet Union, and it has not been seen that any country can use Finnish territory to threaten the Soviet Union. (Havas, 1st)

Stockholm: Regarding the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, newspapers here, regardless of party affiliation, unanimously declared that certain demands of the Soviet government, especially the demands to establish military bases in Finland's Hanko Port or Bergara Port, and that the entire Karelian Isthmus between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga should be demilitarized, are absolutely unacceptable to Finland. Although Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov agreed to cede some land on the Karelian Peninsula to Finland, this is far from the Finnish demilitarization of the Karelian Isthmus and the cession of territory north of Petsamo Port. The newspapers also published many articles by military experts, who said that the Soviet Union intends to control Finland's entire national defense organization. However, as far as Sweden is concerned, if the Soviet Union were to set foot on Finland's Åland Islands (only 20 miles from Stockholm), Sweden would suffer a major threat. (Havas, 2nd)

Helsinki: According to a report received here from the Finnish delegation in Moscow, the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, which were interrupted on October 23, were originally scheduled to resume tonight, but have now been changed to begin tomorrow, because Stalin and Molotov are attending the extraordinary meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today and cannot find time. According to the Finnish representative's telephone report, when the Director of Protocol of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Bagov, met with them, he was extremely cordial. (Haitong Dian, 2nd)

### Soviet Tank Convoy Enters Vilnius: Disturbances Occur Locally

Kaunas: Yesterday night, 40 Soviet tanks suddenly drove into Vilnius from Vievis for unknown reasons. Before the Soviet tanks arrived, there were anti-Jewish demonstrations and marches in Vilnius, beating Jews and entering Jewish homes, wantonly destroying and looting for several hours. Several Jews were seriously injured. Afterwards, Lithuanian troops were deployed in the streets. The Jewish committees in Vilnius and Kaunas are currently appealing to the Lithuanian government. (Reuters, 2nd)

Kaunas: According to news received here, there were many Polish demonstrations in Vilnius yesterday. Because the price of bread has tripled, they gathered in front of shops to protest and marched towards the city hall. When the police tried to stop them, a conflict broke out between the two sides, resulting in two or three people killed and 40 people injured. Order was restored from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Haitong Dian, 2nd)

### Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Decides to Incorporate West Ukraine into the Soviet Union: Accepts the Petition of the National Assembly of West Ukraine

Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Federal and National Chambers, continued to hold joint meetings. A delegation of special commissioners from the National Assembly of West Ukraine issued a declaration requesting approval for West Ukraine to join the Soviet Socialist Federation. The declaration was read by Professor Panichkin, a member of the delegation. Several other members then spoke one after another, including Professor Studynsky of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, oil worker Kravchuk, female worker Tayzhuk, farmer Gavrishchuk, and Polish female worker Guzminska, who described the suffering of the people of West Ukraine under Polish rule in the past, as well as their current happiness after being liberated, and expressed their deep gratitude to the Red Army, the Soviet government, and Stalin. Subsequently, the assembly held a debate. Members of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Bohomolets and the famous writer Korniychuk spoke in favor of the merger of West Ukraine and the Soviet Union. Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union Vyshinsky spoke on behalf of the government and proposed the following draft resolution: "The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, having listened to the declaration of the special commission of the National Assembly of West Ukraine, hereby formally resolves as follows: 1. To accept the petition of the National Assembly of West Ukraine and to allow West Ukraine to join the Soviet Socialist Federation and to reunite with the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Federation. 2. To instruct the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to designate a date for the election of deputies from the West Ukraine region to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. 3. To authorize the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to incorporate West Ukraine into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. 4. To consult the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Republic on the draft regional division of the border area between the Ukrainian Republic and the Belarusian Republic and to submit it to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for adjudication." The aforementioned draft resolution was voted on separately by the two chambers. As a result, it was unanimously adopted by the entire Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. At that time, the venue resounded with thunderous applause, expressing support. The next joint meeting of the Supreme Soviet is scheduled to be held at 6:00 p.m. on November 2. (TASS, 1st)

### Soviet Union Prepares to Withdraw from the League of Nations

London – According to a Geneva dispatch, the Soviet government intends to withdraw from the League of Nations. The Soviet embassy here has neither confirmed nor denied this. It is generally said that if this news is true, then the Soviet ambassador Maisky, who is about to take office as chairman of the current session of the League of Nations Council, would have been notified of this intention by his government. Moreover, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently sent a letter to Ambassador Maisky, informing him that the regular session of the Council would be held on December 4 this year, and the ambassador replied in the name of his government that this was acceptable. In light of this, the above news may not be credible. (Havas, 2nd)

### Netherlands Under Martial Law and Prepares Flood Defenses

The Hague – The government authorities have recently declared martial law in all provinces of the country (except for three provinces). All powers have been transferred to the military authorities. There are rumors that German troops are concentrating near the Dutch border. The Dutch government's actions are intended to prevent future troubles and to safeguard its independence. (One Was News, 1st)

The Hague – The government will soon declare martial law in certain areas of the Netherlands to deal with aggression. After that, administrative power will be entirely in the hands of the military authorities. This measure was announced yesterday by the Dutch Prime Minister in the Lower House and will be implemented in some border areas. The plan to flood the land will also be part of this measure. It is learned that during the World War, the Netherlands took similar action. According to official sources, the Dutch authorities have already stored water in some areas so that they can be flooded in case of attack. In addition, the authorities do not intend to add any further restrictions on newspapers. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Belgian Newspapers Advocate Joint Defense with the Netherlands, the Netherlands Hesitates

Zurich, Switzerland – The Neue Zürcher Zeitung recently reported that Belgian newspapers are deeply concerned that if the Netherlands is invaded, Belgium's security will also be threatened. They generally advocate that the two countries should form a defensive alliance. Although the Belgian authorities are happy to do so, the Netherlands has some hesitations for the following four reasons: First, Germany may regard this alliance as a provocative move. Second, the impact on the Netherlands' interests when Belgium is invaded is not as great as the impact on Belgium's interests when the Netherlands is invaded. Third, the Dutch border line is very long, and it is difficult to send troops to Belgium to assist in the war when necessary. Fourth, even if Britain and France invade Belgium, the Netherlands is unwilling to allow Germany to pass through its territory to aid Belgium. In short, the Netherlands' main goal is to maintain complete independence. (Havas, 2nd)

The Hague – The possibility of a military alliance between the Netherlands and Belgium has been denied here. According to responsible sources, the Dutch government will never enter into a military alliance with Belgium because their principle of neutrality even hinders discussions between the two countries' staff officers. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Turkish President's Speech to Prevent the Spread of War, Iran Approves the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty

Ankara, the Capital of Turkey – President İsmet İnönü delivered a speech yesterday at the National Assembly, stating that the true goal of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty is not only to safeguard Turkey's security but also to establish a safe zone in Europe during the war to prevent the spread of war. The commitments that we have accepted from the two Allied nations of Britain and France are not enough to harm the friendly relations that our country maintains with other countries. We firmly believe that we will be able to stay out of the war, but the security of the country must not be endangered. The commitments that we have accepted from the Allied nations must be implemented when necessary. As for the negotiations that our country recently conducted with the Soviet government, although we have not obtained satisfactory conclusions, the friendship between the two countries still maintains a strong foundation and will not be shaken by the temporary needs caused by the international situation. In short, our country will be friendly with all friendly nations on the one hand, and will continue to fulfill its commitments on the other. (Havas, 2nd)

Baghdad – The Regent of Iran expressed his approval of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish treaty at the opening of parliament today, stating that "this treaty allows this part of the world to look forward to the future with confidence." (Reuters, 1st)

### Swedish-German Trade Negotiations

Stockholm, Capital of Sweden – Germany and Sweden are scheduled to conduct business negotiations here today to "adjust bilateral trade relations under the current circumstances." Although Sweden wants to adjust to a certain extent, if Germany wants to implement the so-called "continental trade plan" and induce Sweden to abandon trade with Britain, the Swedish government will firmly reject it. Regarding this matter, the editorial published by the Social Democratic Newspaper is sufficient to reflect the official view, stating that "Sweden's goal is to maintain normal trade relations with both Britain and Germany within the scope of strict neutrality." (Havas, 2nd)

### Crew of the City of Flint Safe

Copenhagen, Capital of Denmark – Regarding the detention of the American ship "City of Flint," the "Times" correspondent in Berlin cabled that a German official spokesperson said that the American government does not need to worry about the fate of the American sailors on the ship.

It is also reported that Hitler will also order the German ambassadors stationed in other countries to return to the country to report on their duties, so as to understand the general situation in Europe. The National Socialist Party's research on Molotov's speech has led to the recognition that the Soviet Union will not intervene in the European war by force unless Britain and France threaten the Black Sea region.

### Molotov's Speech Triggers Debate in the U.S. House of Representatives, One Congressman Suggests Recalling the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Roosevelt Releases a Previous Telegram from Kalinin

Washington – During today's debate on the neutrality bill in the House of Representatives, Democrat McCormack, because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov attacked U.S. President Roosevelt in his speech to the Soviet Congress, demanded the recall of the ambassador to the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Foreign Minister's criticism was intended to influence American public opinion and was a violation of international law. This sparked a heated debate. Republican Congressman Fish opposed this demand, saying that McCormack's arguments were extremely warlike and unprecedented since the U.S. declaration of war in 1917. McCormack replied that we, as the American people, should place our country in the position of opposing the Godless faction and assisting the Christian and democratic factions. Republican Patton stated that preserving the arms embargo could help end the European war sooner, and that repealing the embargo would be a true historical sign of the outbreak of war. (Reuters, 1st)

Washington – Massachusetts Democratic Congressman McCormack spoke at a meeting of the House of Representatives yesterday, strongly attacking Molotov's speech, saying that Molotov's criticism of the U.S. Neutrality Act amendment violated international law, and suggested that the government recall the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. McCormack continued, "Not canceling the arms embargo clause is an indirect aid to the Soviet Union and Germany." Iowa Democratic Congressman Izac spoke in support of the administration's neutrality bill and also mentioned Molotov's speech, calling Molotov "Hitler's right-hand man, whose attacks on us are because we have not done what they wanted us to do." New York Republican Congressman Fish attacked McCormack's speech, calling it "the most inflammatory speech for war since 1917." (Associated Press, 2nd)

Washington – White House Secretary Early recently told reporters that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov criticized President Roosevelt's attitude towards the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union. This happened when U.S. Congressmen were about to vote on the Neutrality Act amendment, which was not "accidental." President Roosevelt had not read the full text of the speech, but I personally had read some paragraphs in the newspapers. "I can't help but wonder if Molotov's views are accidental. Negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland have been conducted in extreme secrecy in the past three weeks. It is noteworthy that Molotov revealed the issues being discussed at this time." Secretary of State Hull also told reporters that Molotov's speech does not need to be commented on, but it must be said that any friendly country is justified in mediating with other countries in order to maintain peace, which is generally recognized. In addition, when the House of Representatives met today, Democratic Congressman McCormack gave a speech saying that Molotov's speech was a "means" of interfering with the discussion of the U.S. Neutrality Act amendment. The U.S. government should recall the ambassador to the Soviet Union to protest Molotov's criticism of President Roosevelt. The Congressmen applauded enthusiastically for a long time. (Havas, 1st)

Washington – After President Roosevelt telegraphed German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on April 14 this year, calling for peace, Soviet Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin telegraphed his admiration, which was recently released by the White House, stating that "Your Excellency's call from a high place has been warmly responded to by all nations who sincerely wish to maintain world peace." This is the only formal response made by President Roosevelt since Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov gave a speech criticizing President Roosevelt's interference in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland. (Havas, 1st)

New York – After Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov criticized the United States for not giving freedom to Cuba and the Philippine Islands in his speech, The New York Times recently commented that "Cuba had previously allowed the United States to intervene in its affairs for financial reasons. Now, the country has been a completely free and independent nation for five years. As for the Philippine Islands, they will also achieve independence in 1946. All of this is known to students in Cuba, the Philippines, and the United States. It is insulting to their intelligence to be told about these events. It is hard to believe that Molotov's knowledge is so poor." (Havas, 1st)

### A Glimpse of Public Opinion in Various Countries Regarding the Soviet Union's Attitude, Germany Reveals Disappointment, Japan Raises Several Hopes

Berlin – After Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov gave his speech, German officials were extremely disappointed. This has been seen by observers in various neutral countries, but the German media still wants to cover it up, still calling the Soviet Union "the most progressive country in the world." The National Observer lightly mocked it in an article, stating that "If Britain and France want to expand the current local war into World War II, the Soviet government will definitely resist it with all its strength. Molotov faithfully stated his views in his speech yesterday. He did not make empty promises to the Soviet Union's allies, but severely warned those who were tempted by foreign forces. In short, the Soviet Union will not allow anyone to attack Germany within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, a guarantee that is not only limited to the Baltic coast but also extends to the Black Sea." In addition, a certain newspaper also stated that "Germany can have a strong Soviet Union as a shield," which is enough to reflect the uneasy mentality of the German authorities. (Havas, 2nd)

Rome – Political figures here believe that Molotov's speech failed to confirm optimistic hopes or terrifying predictions. They believe that this speech was entirely neutral in tone, and the arguments in the first part are quite similar to those of Germany. It can be regarded as a declaration of spiritual unity between the Soviet Union and Germany. On the other hand, although the Soviet Union maintains neutrality, it still supports Germany's peace efforts. The Soviet Union's important position has been confirmed, because Britain and France failed to form an alliance with the Soviet Union after months of negotiations. Moreover, the current position of the Soviet Union cannot be regarded as an expression of friendship towards Britain and France, but Britain and France do not hate the Soviet Union. Romanian figures believe that although Molotov criticized democratic countries, the Soviet Union is already in a superior political position. When the League of Nations General Assembly meets in December, the Soviet Union may launch a peace offensive in Geneva. (Haitong, 2nd)

Tokyo – Japanese newspapers have welcomed Molotov's proposal to re-establish friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, but only on the condition that the Soviet Union amends its Far East policy and cuts off relations with General Chiang Kai-shek. The Asahi Shimbun said that if the Soviet Union is sincere, the conclusion of a Soviet-Japanese barter agreement is inevitable. The Kokumin Shimbun speculated that if peace in Europe is agreed upon, Japan will have sufficient reason to fear U.S. intervention in China. Japanese public opinion supports closer ties with Germany and Italy, with the Soviet Union also joining. The Kouchi Shimbun commented on Molotov's speech, stating that although the resolution of border disputes and the arrangement of trade exchanges are both beneficial to the improvement of relations between the two countries, they cannot be called major. The prerequisite for a major improvement in relations between the two countries is obviously the withdrawal of Soviet forces from China and the termination of aid to the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The fact that Molotov did not mention China at all in this speech raises the question of whether the Soviet government is prepared to establish a political agreement with Japan regarding the Far East. Judging from the surface of Molotov's speech, it seems that there is a strong desire to improve Soviet-Japanese relations. Conflicts on the border, disputes over fisheries treaties, and the resentment caused by various minor incidents between the two countries since 1931 may disappear from now on. Foreign Minister Nomura also announced his policy of adjusting Japanese-Soviet relations on October 21. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan's position towards the Soviet Union is different from that of Britain and France. Britain and France are eager to obtain the Soviet Union's cooperation in order to contain Germany's power. However, Japan's position is that even without the Soviet Union's support, it can implement its own policies. Moreover, there are ideological boundaries between Japan and the Soviet Union, so Japan must adhere to its anti-communist policy. (Reuters, 2nd)

London – The Times commented today on Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recent speech, stating that Berlin was looking forward to Molotov's speech with great anticipation, but now they must be greatly disappointed to see that he worded it this way, because the only real decision in his speech was that the Soviet Union would continue to maintain neutrality. Although Molotov mentioned little about the Soviet Union's relations with Japan and Turkey, it is heard that Soviet-Turkish relations have remained cordial since the recent breakdown of negotiations, and negotiations will continue to be held. If both countries are determined to consolidate the unity of the Balkan countries, then their interests should not be difficult to reconcile. However, communism is a disruptive force, coupled with Pan-Slavism, which may not be able to promote the unity of Southeast Europe. The most honest statement in Molotov's speech seems to be an explanation of the Soviet Union's future goals, that is, to let go in international affairs. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Abyssinian Princess Defects

### China's Determination to Resist Japan Is Not Affected by International Developments, Yen Hui-ching Makes a Statement in the United States

Washington – According to Dr. Yen Hui-ching, the former Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union and now the chief representative of China at the Pacific Relations Conference, he told reporters from the Associated Press today that he does not believe that the new alignment of countries in the world, such as the cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany, and the Soviet-Japanese compromise that Molotov mentioned, can affect China's position in resisting Japan. China is determined to continue resisting Japan until the Japanese militarists realize that China cannot be conquered. When asked if he had been appointed as the Chinese Ambassador to the United States or other countries, Yen replied that he had previously served as an envoy in the United States and the Soviet Union. As for his future plans, he would spend the rest of his years engaged in private and semi-official work, such as the work he is currently undertaking at the Pacific Relations Conference. He also said that the current international situation is very complicated, so it is extremely difficult to provide a detailed explanation of the development of the European situation and clarify its impact on the Far East. However, he believes that the Soviet Union's actions, no matter what, will not affect China's resistance to Japan, and he said that if the Soviet Union and Japan can truly strive for peace, China will welcome the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan. Dr. Yen also stated that he intends to visit Secretary of State Hull, or even call on President Roosevelt, but there is no other meaning besides expressing respect. At the same time, during his stay here, his only task is to attend the Pacific Relations Conference and discuss the Philippine issue. Yen claimed that many Filipinos hope that the United States will not abandon the Philippines. He also said that he made a brief stop in Mumbai and saw that the Indians had a bad impression of the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland, so India lost a lot of sympathy for the Soviet Union. Therefore, he believes that it is difficult for the Soviet Union to expand its influence in India. Regarding the U.S. Neutrality Act, Yen said that China is quite uneasy about this. What China needs is for the United States to truly cut off the supply of arms to the aggressor country. China's current resistance is for independence, for survival, and for justice. However, China is extremely grateful for the sympathy of the democratic countries, especially the United States, and hopes that the United States' sympathy can be translated into concrete assistance as soon as possible.

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations: The Sticking Point is the Silver Deposit Issue

London: According to reliable Japanese sources, the reason why the Sino-British-Japanese negotiations stalled again last week was still the issue of Chinese silver deposits in the British concession in Tianjin. During the continued negotiations between British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kensuke Horiuchi, the latter insisted on handing over 14 million silver dollars deposited by the Chinese government in the Bank of Communications in the British concession in Tianjin, otherwise refusing to discuss the resolution of the Tianjin issue. Horiuchi also stated that this money was intended to relieve the flood disaster in North China. However, according to observations from diplomatic circles of third countries with interests in China other than Britain, Japan seems to be trying to force Britain and Germany to abandon their concessions in Tianjin. As for the Shanghai International Settlement, because it is related to the United States and other countries, Japan will inevitably take more cautious action in this regard. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

London: The diplomatic correspondent of The Times learned that the negotiations on various British-Japanese issues caused by the Japanese army occupying several provinces of China are currently still suspended. The Japanese government is clearly waiting for the effective establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime, placing its hopes on this. However, the regime does not seem to be able to be realized in the short term, because the leaders of the Japanese military are opposed to Wang's desire to include North China in the territory under the jurisdiction of the new regime. In addition to not wanting to cede North China, Wang also demanded the right to financial independence, which the supporters of Wang did not want to grant either. As for the National Government, it seems to be exaggerating its recent military victories somewhat, but there is no doubt that its spirit of resistance remains very strong. It is also worth noting that the heavy financial burden Japan has suffered due to the war has not eased at all. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### Japan's Attitude Toward the United States Suddenly Softens

Tokyo: Former Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara (currently a member of the House of Peers) issued a statement today, stating that he believes the Japanese government is deeply aware of the seriousness of the US problem and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will do its best to adjust Japan-US relations. We must know that if Japan-US relations are not improved by small means, they will inevitably deteriorate, which is something Japan must avoid. At the same time, the Pacific Association, mainly composed of Shidehara, Abe, and others, also published an article, praising the frankness of the speech by US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, and expressing gratitude to Grew for conveying the opinions and views of the American public. What should also be noted by the US is that during the course of the war, the special rights and interests of the United States in China have sometimes not been fully implemented. It also said that the Japanese government is now doing its best to promote the establishment of the Wang Jingwei government. Once Japan's policy toward China is somewhat clear, Foreign Minister Nomura will engage in negotiations on US-Japan relations with US Ambassador Grew. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

### March of Wartime Europe (Continued)

— Special Correspondent in London, Shudi

Therefore, the focus of the problem is: How can the Polish military force of about 1.5 million be resolved quickly?

Does Germany believe that it can resolve the Polish military force in a short period of time? Judging from the tone of some German publications recently, it probably believes so. According to the opinions of these authors, the war, from the beginning, focuses on strategic victory, rather than haggling over a certain area or a certain battle, in order to determine the overall situation of success or failure in the short term, making long-term Polish resistance impossible. Judging from the actual progress of the war in the past few days, Germany is following this path; however, whether the future can be as expected by Germany remains to be proven by facts.

In this stage, Germany's biggest concerns are two things: first, Italy's sudden capture by Britain, France, and Russia; and second, changes in Poland's internal political structure and cooperation with the Soviet Union. These are two distant crises, and at present, they are of course completely impossible. However, if the German-Polish war drags on for a long time, then this gradually has the danger of becoming possible. Because of this, Germany has to make the greatest determination and use the greatest strength to quickly resolve Poland.

If Germany really resolves Poland, and quickly, then what are its next intentions? There is no doubt that in the West, it will brew an armistice with Britain and France; in the East, after plundering all the Polish machinery, raw materials, and stocks, it will annex the industrial area of Upper Silesia in its western part. As for the relationship with Soviet Russia, it will still retain a buffer zone.

This stage can be given a name, which is: "Winning by Fighting Poland."

After winning by fighting Poland, if Britain and France still refuse to make peace, then German diplomacy will have failed again. And the problem placed in front of Germany will be further expanded and become more serious. The realization of this situation, judging from the methods and courage of the current authorities in Britain and France, is probably very possible. If so, then Hitler still has to continue to make his case to the following.

Hitler is very aware of this level, so he is also preparing his countermeasures.

The first point of this countermeasure, without a doubt, is to take advantage of the slight difference in the tasks of Britain and France as naval powers and land powers, to try his best to befriend France, on the one hand, coercing it with the hopelessness of French land warfare against Germany, and on the other hand, persuading it with Germany's lack of ambition towards France. In this way, he calculates that he can shake France's will to fight and relax the solidarity of Britain and France. At the same time, he is conducting secret diplomacy with Britain, helping the revival of the diplomacy of reactionary elements.

If peace brewing fails, then the "war" must continue.

In the war against Britain and France at this time, if the attacks of Britain and France are not very serious, then Germany will adopt a defensive posture on the one hand, closing its doors to build a navy, and then come out to compete with Britain and France at sea; on the other hand, it will intensify its activities in Southeastern Europe, the Near East, and Africa. Germany calculates that if this drags on, the ones who will cry out in pain first must be Britain and France, not Germany. Goering once said: "Everything that Britain and France use is money; Germany, on the other hand, only uses manpower." Indeed, under the current mobilization situation of Britain and France, large-scale consumption is really difficult to maintain for a long time without any intention, just to maintain the situation of war. This point is a huge advantage for a German-style country where there is no big difference between wartime and peacetime.

What if the offensive of Britain and France is serious? (Hitler calculates that it will not be) Then Germany will probably fight back; but there is a big prerequisite, that is, the participation of Italy and Spain in the war, and at the same time, it will make a gesture of further cooperation with the Soviet Union. If that is the case, then the situation will be particularly serious.

In that case, at a certain moment, the United States will definitely and must participate in the war. Under the circumstances of the United States participating in the war, Hitler's last card is to simply truly cooperate with the Soviet Union.

On the eve of using troops against Poland, Hitler shouted in an impassioned tone: "I tell you: Germany will never sign a second 'Treaty of Versailles!'"

These days, judging from Germany's actions in various aspects, probably, the unspoken commentary on the first sentence is now gradually being spoken, which is: "Germany is willing to be red."

Germany's "reddening" is, of course, a rather laughable statement at present. However, if Germany is defeated by Britain, France, and other countries in the war, this sentence will immediately become a reality.

After the socialist country of the Soviet Union, plus a socialist country of Germany, the European situation at that time is unimaginable. This makes the heads of the general capitalist imperialist countries have to frown a few more times and fall into deep contemplation when adopting major plans against Germany!

In this way, in turn, Hitler has put a big problem in front of the authorities of Britain and France!

This time Hitler engaged in the Polish adventure, his ambition and determination were so thorough. What is described here is only an outline. (To be continued)

### Japanese Troops Repeatedly Defeated in Southern Shandong; More Than 100 Casualties in the Mengyin Area; Attempt to Repair the Tai-Zhao Road Encounters Setback

Xuzhou Correspondent: The Japanese troops in southern Shandong have been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army and are still struggling desperately. Since September 30, the Japanese troops in Linyi have divided into two groups, totaling six or seven hundred men, one along the Linmeng Highway, passing through Shuanghouji, and the other crossing the river at Madizi, passing through Zhuman. The Japanese troops in Feixian, four hundred men, crossed the Fang River in several groups, passing through Xuezhuang. The Japanese troops in Mengyin, more than two hundred men, passed through Taoxu and Dazhuang. The above groups launched attacks on the Chinese army simultaneously. At the same time, two or three hundred Japanese troops in Mengyin were stationed north of Dazhuang as sniper units. The Chinese army detected the Japanese army's intentions in advance, so it moved south along Mount Meng and took strict surveillance of the Japanese army. The Japanese army failed to make a sneak attack. A part of the Japanese army, about three or four hundred men, went out of Baimayu Pass through Zijingguan, went to Guodong via Mount Meng, and attempted to intercept the Chinese army. Another group of Japanese troops, three or four hundred men, moved from Baimayu and came into contact with a certain division of the Chinese army's rear guard near Liujiacun Baimaguan. After the unit's roundabout cover, the Japanese army was repelled at Baimaguan. In this battle, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed. In early October, more than 500 Japanese troops in Mengyin advanced east along the Xinmeng Highway and came into contact with a certain unit 40 li north of Mengyin. Although the Japanese army launched several fierce attacks, they all failed. At dusk, the Japanese army, under the cover of artillery fire, attempted to occupy the high ground on the left flank of the Chinese army. The Chinese army waited for them to approach and launched a fierce flanking attack. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and was finally repelled by the Chinese army. In this battle, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Chinese army also suffered more than 30 casualties. The Japanese troops who came to aid were eventually intercepted and driven back. In this decisive battle in southern Shandong, the Chinese army achieved satisfactory results. More than 150 Japanese and puppet troops in Taierzhuang, together with the Japanese troops who crossed the Grand Canal from Taierzhuang, attempted to build a branch road from Taier to Zhao. At 9 pm on October 17, they reappeared in Huanjilou Township, about eight li north of Chefushan, and forced the local people to build earthworks. Upon receiving the report, Guo Xiaxuan, the county magistrate of Tongshan, immediately dispatched the Fourth Brigade of Guo Zimin's unit and Zhang Yuantai's unit, with more than 400 troops, to set off in two directions to meet the enemy. At 2 pm, they came into contact with the Japanese army about two li south of Banlou. After fierce fighting until 5:30 pm, the Japanese and puppet troops were defeated and fled to Taierzhuang. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and pursued them to Yanglou Village, south of Taierzhuang, and returned only after dark. In this battle, a total of 18 Japanese and puppet troops were killed and 14 were wounded. The Chinese army lost four non-commissioned officers and eight soldiers, and four were wounded. Four Type 38 rifles and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. The Japanese troops in Yixian County are again reinforcing Taierzhuang, and the momentum will be even fiercer. This area is at the junction of Qi and Si and is more than 20 li away from the border of Tong. The Jiangsu provincial authorities have telegraphed Wang Huayun, the county magistrate of Pi, to continue to destroy the railway, so that the Japanese army cannot repair the Longhai Railway and the Tai-Zhao branch road.

### Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education: Key Points for Improving Provincial and County Education; Province Divided into Five Normal School Districts; Various Education Funds Guaranteed to be Independent

(Lishui News) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has put forward ten key points for improving Zhejiang education in order to rectify education throughout the province. These are as follows: (1) The province is divided into five normal school districts, each district having a normal school. The number of classes is increased according to the needs of teachers in each county in the normal school district. The senior high school normal school courses and simple normal school classes in the original provincial high schools are respectively transferred to the normal schools for management. (2) The principals of county-run elementary schools in each county are trained centrally by the province in districts. Teachers of county-run elementary schools and principals and teachers of district, township, and private elementary schools and short-term elementary schools and mass schools are trained centrally by the county in phases and batches, and regulations are stipulated for the in-service training methods for teachers and staff of all levels of schools every semester. (5) Normal school graduates are assigned to serve in various counties by the Department of Education in a unified manner and treated equally. Those in poor counties whose teachers' salaries cannot reach the prescribed standards may be subsidized by provincial funds. (4) The salaries of elementary school teachers in each county are graded according to qualifications and experience, and all are increased, and implemented from the 29th year. (5) The education funds of each county (excluding the provincial allocation) should be stipulated to account for 25% of the total county funds as a minimum limit. The funds of district, township, and town elementary schools should be increased as much as possible by the district education fund production association or sponsorship committee or the district, township, and town offices. The funds of private elementary schools should be planned by the board of directors and their independence guaranteed in accordance with central laws and regulations. The province and the county jointly plan to open up new sources of taxation to increase education funds, and request the central government to allocate the income tax to the province and county in accordance with the current fixed percentage to be fully used for education funds. (6) The county-run high schools in each county are restricted or merged according to the education funding situation of each county and the management of each school. (8) The section chief of the county education section should be appointed by those who meet the prescribed qualifications, and should not be removed arbitrarily. The number of supervisors and staff should be determined according to the complexity of the county's education affairs, and a detailed list of staff quotas will be stipulated by the Department of Education. The school board assistants and school board assistants should be given salaries and office expenses, which should be paid from the county administrative expenses. (9) In addition to the education undertakings in the guerrilla areas that are directly managed by the province, high and junior high school supplementary schools should be set up extensively in various counties to widely accommodate students who have lost their schooling in the war zones. Those set up by the county itself should be subsidized by provincial funds as much as possible, and treated better than those in the rear. If teaching materials cannot be purchased, they will be issued by the province. (10) The Zhejiang West Administrative Office has set up a Guerrilla Area Education Supervision Office, which is organized by the Department of Education selecting three to five supervisors to inspect education in various counties in the guerrilla area.

### Review and Prospects of Mass Education Centers (4)

— Chen Lijiang

Future Improvements and Enrichment: During the Anti-Japanese War, the work of mobilizing the masses should be vigorously promoted, and it is especially urgent to raise national consciousness and enhance anti-war sentiment. The Mass Education Center is the central organization for mass education undertakings and work in a district or county, and it is even more necessary to improve and enrich it. Now, I will excerpt from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education's General Situation of Sichuan Social Education from the 25th to the 27th years, the points that it intends to start rectifying for mass education centers:

(1) The organization should be sound. Each county mass education center should be ordered to comply with the prescribed organization and methods, and complete the filing procedures as soon as possible. (2) Expand the scope of work. Mass education centers must take the initiative to contact various social education institutions in the county and jointly seek the promotion of mass education. (3) Formulate a plan. At the beginning of the year, mass education centers should formulate a central work plan based on past work conditions and the needs of the time and place, and implement it within a time limit. At the end of the year, a detailed report on the implementation process and results should be made for assessment and improvement. (4) Carefully select talents. Select talented mass education cadres and send them to various counties to preside over or guide. When there is a lack of staff, methods should be found to train them, and detailed methods for the assessment, supervision, rewards, and punishments of mass education workers should be formulated as soon as possible. (5) Raise more funds. Raise as much funding as possible for mass education centers to ensure that there is no lack of funding for mass education undertakings. (6) Complete equipment. Set equipment standards for mass education centers in various counties and cities. (7) Order local governments. Local officials should list the mobilization and promotion of mass education center work as one of the performance evaluations. The above points can give a glimpse of the improvements and enrichment that mass education centers should make. In order to enable mass education centers in various places to have a common goal, uniform organization, and concrete work, the Ministry of Education promulgated various regulations related to mass education centers this year. Recently, the Ministry of Education, together with the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education's Third District Special Office, etc., has directly guided the improvement of mass education centers in the third district of Sichuan Province and Chongqing City, where the Ministry of Education is located, as models for various places. In addition to directly assisting the mass education centers in the third district of Sichuan Province, the Ministry of Education is also working to reorganize and expand mass education centers in various places. Among them, the main ones are the following:

(1) Increase Social Education Funds. It has long been stipulated by the central government that social education funds should account for 10% to 20% of the original education funds. In the new education funds, at least 30% should be for provinces and cities, and 30% to 50% should be for counties and cities. Some places comply with this, but many still do not meet the standard. It is planned to reissue the previous order and complete it within a time limit, and use a part of the social education funds exclusively for reorganizing and expanding mass education centers.

(2) Effectively Train Talents. The training of social education talents is extremely important. The Ministry of Education has successively held training classes for electro-optical education personnel, training classes for mass education cadres, training classes for music instructors, and seminars for school personnel concurrently handling social education. Recently, it is planned to hold training classes for mass education center directors, drawing directors of mass education centers from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces in phases to improve work efficiency.

(3) Formulate Equipment Standards. The equipment of mass education centers in various places has never had prescribed standards, resulting in simplicity and wastefulness. The Ministry of Education is now hiring experts to draft equipment standards for mass education centers separately, and dividing the standards into two types, A and B. Type A is suitable for those with a regular budget of more than 5,000 yuan, and Type B is suitable for those with a regular budget of less than 5,000 yuan. It will be promulgated soon.

(4) Publish Guidance Series. The Ministry of Education is now working on compiling a series of social education guidance books. Mass Education Centers is one of the series. There are detailed instructions on the establishment, development, direction, goals, organization, funding, construction, equipment, and work progress of mass education centers. In the future, it is planned to edit small implementation series for mass education centers. All teaching undertakings, guidance facts, livelihood education, and artistic education should have concrete guidance on methods.

(5) Compile Various Teaching Materials. Social education teaching materials should also be deeply noted by those engaged in mass education centers. The Ministry of Education is currently compiling popular mass readings, new and old scripts, lyrics, physical models, specimens, film scripts, and slides in large quantities to meet the practical needs of promoting mass education in various places.

(6) Strictly Implement the Guidance System. Mass education centers themselves should be responsible for guiding social education. This has been clearly stipulated in the regulations. The Ministry of Education has assigned supervisors to conduct on-site inspections and guidance on the progress of social education in various places. In the future, it is hoped that education administrative organs at all levels will pay full attention to and effectively promote the supervisory work.

At this time of national crisis, those who implement mass education must start from the real and difficult lives of the masses, and serve, struggle, and sacrifice with the most sincere sincerity to strive for national survival. The Mass Education Center is the most reasonable place for us to engage in mass education. We should step up our efforts. One point of effort will surely have one point of harvest. Let us work hard to transform mass education into a grassroots organization and driving force for resisting Japan and building the country. (The End)

### Finland Declares: Determined Not to Abandon the World Games, Must Be Held Under Any Circumstances; US Takeover Still Difficult to Decide

Since the outbreak of war in Europe, doubts have arisen as to whether the 12th World Olympic Games, scheduled to be held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, next year, will be held on schedule. The United States has already expressed willingness to take over if Finland abandons the games. Yesterday, this newspaper received a notice from the Finnish World Games Organizing Committee, strongly denying rumors that Finland would abandon the 12th World Games. The notice stated: "Since the change in the international situation, there have been rumors in various countries that Finland is preparing to abandon the 1940 Olympic Games. The organizing committee would like to take this opportunity to make three points: (1) All external rumors are false. (2) Preparations have not stopped. (3) The games will be held under any circumstances. The Finnish government has expressed its strong support, and the Helsinki City Council also passed a resolution on September 13 that preparations should continue. Currently, all the facilities for the games, except for the swimming pool, have been completed and are ready for use. The swimming pool and the Olympic Village will be completed next spring. All the major and minor events have been scheduled, and the competition rules and management regulations have also been drafted and notified to various organizations. Many of the prime seats have been paid for and the funds transferred to Finland."

As for the United States taking over, according to New York news, this will only be discussed if Finland expresses willingness to abandon the games. Since Finland has expressed its determination, a decision may be difficult to make in the short term.

### Finance: Hong Kong Banks Most Aggressive Sellers; Exchange Rate Market Hovering with a Loosening Trend

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. The black market trend for the British pound and US dollar was loose, and the situation was ordinary. Most people were calm and watching. However, Hong Kong banks were still selling aggressively, but there was no significant reaction between buying and selling. Throughout the day, the opening rates were flat. After the Hong Kong Electric Company (Hong Kong Bank) initially offered to sell, speculators also offered shillings. Then, due to the strong intention to supply from the American Bank Chase (National City Bank), the price quickly rose to 5 and 1/8 pence at 15.625 and 8.59375 yuan. However, after the Jewish merchant George Joseph, who had sold on the previous day, suddenly came to cover his position for profit, the price once softened. The selling price of the British Gold Bank immediately retreated to 5 and 1/8 pence at 09.375 and 8.5 yuan for the US dollar. Later, due to the Hong Kong Electric Company's renewed offering, and the Japanese banks Sumitomo also selling, the price hardened again. From then on, it loosened directly to 5 and 1/4 pence at 21.875 and 8.6875 yuan, which was the closing price and the strongest rate. Along the way, the Hong Kong Electric Company and the American Bank Chase continued to sell, while the Jardine Matheson (纱花) Bank absorbed some. As for futures trading, it has gradually become more active, and there are many new positions being opened. Overall, trading was somewhat thin.

George Joseph Covering Short Positions for Profit

In the morning, the London large bill was close to 125 in the long term, the New York silver price did not change, and the London raw gold was fixed.

After the opening, the Hong Kong Electric Company came to sell, and speculators also sold shillings. In addition, the American Bank Chase and others showed intention to supply, causing the market to loosen. It is estimated that the Hong Kong Electric Company and speculators sold spot British gold to foreign banks for 5 and 1/8 pence at 109.375 and 156.25, and then the Hong Kong Electric Company and a certain bank of Chase sold spot US dollars to foreign banks, Jardine Matheson, and Chinese merchants for 8.5 yuan and 59.375.

After that, the Jewish merchant George Joseph suddenly covered his position for profit, so the situation softened for a while. It is estimated that George Joseph bought spot British gold for the current month from foreign banks for 5 and 1/8 pence at 125. Later, the spot selling price was called by foreign banks as tight as 5 and 1/8 pence at 09.375 and 8.5 yuan. Then, the Hong Kong Electric Company came to sell again, and the Japanese banks Zhengjin and Sumitomo also came to sell, so the situation hardened again.

It was already noon.

American and Japanese Merchants Continue to Sell

In the afternoon market, the Hong Kong Electric Company continued to sell, and the American bank still regretted its intention to supply. Although Jardine Matheson slightly absorbed some, its position still felt abundant, so the situation continued to loosen. It is estimated that the Hong Kong Electric Company and the American bank successively sold spot British gold to Jardine Matheson and foreign banks for 5 and 1/8 pence at 187.5 and 218.75, and spot US dollars for 8.625 yuan and 687.5.

### Gold Market Regretful; Although Hong Kong Banks Are Buying in Small Amounts, What Can Be Done Against High Selling

Yesterday's cash blistered red (烚赤) black market situation continued to fall miserably, regretfully, because the market lacked good news. Conversely, 19 out of 10 short sellers profited. It was also heard that the gold price in Tianjin was higher than that in this city, exceeding the cost of transportation, with a difference as large as 300 yuan. Therefore, merchants from Tianjin have been continuously bringing gold to Shanghai to sell, which is naturally considerable, so the number of chips has increased invisibly. Although Hong Kong banks are constantly buying in small amounts, their positions are still abundant. Moreover, retail investors are bound to sell at high prices, and foreign exchange is reported to be both loose and hard, making it difficult for the market price to support itself for a while. The morning opening plummeted by 30 yuan, to 3,660 yuan. Later, due to the Hong Kong banks' good appetite and the retail investors' joining in, it once rebounded by 20 yuan. However, securities firms immediately sold and pressed down the price. Later, due to the exchange market once reporting softness, people's hearts could not help but be shaken, and the price rose to 3,685 yuan. However, the lowest price of 3,640 yuan was seen until the afternoon, and the closing price was still 3,640 yuan, because foreign exchange softened again. The trading throughout the day was still strong, about 1,000 taels. The jewelry gold hung low by 5 yuan, and the customs gold remained flat.

Another Fall of 46 Yuan

From the morning, the initial situation of each bar (10 taels) was still scattered and weak. Then, hearing that the foreign exchange market was hardening, people's morale was even more discouraged. A certain gold shop, acting on behalf of a speculator, first pressed down the price and sold, and the opening fell sharply by 30 yuan. The gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,660 yuan. Shortly after, the Hong Kong banks took advantage of the low price to pull in, and at the same time, retail investors followed suit, rising by 20 yuan. A money exchange firm entered 10 taels to a gold shop for 3,680 yuan. Later, because securities firms took the opportunity to sell, and because foreign exchange was still trending weakly, the price could not support itself and fell. The securities firms sold 30 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,652 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange suddenly returned to softness, and people's hearts were shaken, and the market situation turned around. A certain money exchange firm strongly absorbed more than 200 taels, rebounding by 33 yuan. The money exchange firm entered 30 taels to a silver shop firm for 3,685 yuan. After that, the exchange market returned to looseness, the retail selling wind rose again, and the silver shop firms were also eager to sell short, and the market situation once again fell by 20 yuan. The money exchange firms traded 30 taels with each other for 3,665 yuan, which was the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was quite stable. First, the securities firms traded 30 taels with each other for 3,668 yuan. Then, because a certain gold shop sold on behalf of its customers, the price fell slightly by 13 yuan. The money exchange firm entered 20 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,655 yuan. At that time, a certain securities firm covered its short position for profit, pulling up the price by 12 yuan. The securities firm entered 20 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,667 yuan. After entering, due to the hardening of foreign exchange, fewer people entered. In addition, the silver shop firms and a certain gold shop sold and stuffed each other, and the price fell by 27 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 10 taels to the securities firm for 3,640 yuan. Near the closing, a certain silver shop bought cheaply, pulling up the price by 4 yuan. A certain silver shop entered 20 taels to its counterpart for 3,644 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price continued to fall by 46 yuan compared to the previous day. The fluctuation throughout the day was 45 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher compared to the blistered red, and the purchase price had to be reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current margin gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Hangs Low by 5 Yuan

The exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael was initially still 375 yuan for the Da Tong Hang. By 10:18 AM, it was reduced by 5 yuan, and there were no changes after that. As a result, the Da Tong Hang changed to 370 yuan, which was the same as the price of the Xin Tong Hang. The purchase price was reduced by 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Market Prices Deteriorating Daily

Yesterday, due to the increasing supply of foreign exchange and the weakness of the blistered red, the demand for British and American gold pounds was very rare, and the supply of British and American gold notes was very smooth, gradually declining. The US dollar note fell by as much as 11 yuan and 6 jiao (角) in the evening market. The Hong Kong note followed the decline due to the abundant supply of Hong Kong exchange. The supply of Singapore and Dutch notes increased, and the Canadian and Philippine notes loosened and fell with the US dollar note. The Japanese gold note was weak first and then rebounded, with the evening market at 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 li (厘). The demand for Korean won was enthusiastic, with the evening market at 1 yuan and 1 jiao. Yesterday's market prices were: British and American gold pounds both fell by 1 yuan, British gold note fell by 1 yuan and 2 jiao, US dollar note fell by 0.32 yuan, Hong Kong note fell by 0.05 yuan, French franc note fell by 0.005 yuan, and Singapore, Dutch, Canadian, and Philippine notes all fell by 0.1 yuan. Other currencies did not change.

### Rediscount Rates Continue to Shrink

Yesterday's rediscount rate for bills of exchange hovered low, initially still around 39 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and then fell to 35 yuan. Near noon, it began to rebound, to 37.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it stood still at the original price, still 37.5 yuan. It was reduced again by 1.5 yuan. The interbank interest rate of the Money Exchange Association was still posted at 0.15 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, without change.

### Securities: Sino-French Bonds Soar by Nine Pounds; Domestic Debt Market Fluctuates; Foreign Stock Purchases Increase Without Decrease

London, 1st: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts continued to rise sharply, with upper-tier bonds rising by 3 to 9 pounds and lower-tier bonds also rising by 1 to 3 pounds. Among the upper-tier bonds, Sino-French US dollars jumped by 9 pounds, with the asking price at 14 pounds. Reorganization (British Issued) rose by 7 pounds, with the price at 35 pounds. Anglo-German Continuation (British Issued) and Anglo-French (British Issued) each rose by 5 pounds, with the former at 47 pounds and the latter at 38 pounds.

The Longhai Railway rose by 3 pounds to 12 pounds, and the rest rose by 1 pound each, all at 13 pounds. Overall, the tariff and Boxer indemnity guaranteed bonds in the upper tier rose the most sharply, followed by salt tax bonds, and then railway bonds.

Yesterday's black market situation for securities was quite volatile, but the changes were not due to attacks from unfavorable external factors, but only because the bulls had lost contact, which was taken advantage of by the bears. London foreign government bonds rose greatly again, continuing to be as high as 5 to 9 pounds, causing people's hearts to flicker and sink. During this incubation period, the bond market's fluctuation could not be avoided. However, its trend should still be a curved upward climb. Yesterday, in the morning, because Hong Kang and Shun Kang continued to buy, the initial opening was raised by 6 to 7 jiao, and the Class E father almost approached the 50 yuan mark. Only because many retail bulls took the opportunity to emerge, the market price gradually declined. Class C fell back close to the 9 yuan mark. Tong Shun and others also sold quite a bit. In the afternoon, the situation felt even weaker. Da Tong, Mao Tai, and retail investors sold successively. The market still declined gradually due to too few buyers. Class C re-entered the 9 yuan mark. People's hearts were weak, completely based on the friction between bulls and bears. As a result, the market price rebounded by 0.03 to 0.045 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Public Trading Place Report: Yesterday's stock market was potentially strong all day, and several prices reached new highs. In the morning, many floating bulls cut and settled, but when the market opened in the afternoon, due to the appearance of new accounts, various stocks rose to their peak under the tide of public purchases. When profit-takers competed to emerge, the closing price fell slightly, but the trend was still extremely strong. The trust company stocks and the Rui Rong stocks were the most noticeable. The interest in rubber stocks was also more intense. The Lange Zhi stock opened at a high record of 25 yuan.

London, 1st: Today, the listed market prices of Far East British companies' stocks also rose steadily. The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (麥加利銀行) stock rose by 5 shillings, with the price at 8 pounds even.

### Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Stable; Heard That the Assembly Place Will Be Relocated

The yarn market is calm, hovering on a horizontal line. The ups and downs throughout the day are only between 5 yuan. Currently, most market sentiment is optimistic, because the Guangdong banks have been stagnant for a long time. Although there is no large-scale transaction development, retail business continues uninterrupted, so stability is seen step by step. There is also a saying that the stocks of various factories have been accumulating for a long time, and spot goods are gradually increasing, with the intention of opening sales. However, in this mixed market of soft and hard, it is difficult to deal with. The exchange rate is also on a wandering path. Based on the above situation, it is greatly between advancing and retreating, and there is a deep fear of circling for a long time. However, some hand goods are unwilling to sacrifice and settle due to excessive losses, so the market holds on step by step.

At the morning opening of current yarn, the Hong Kong banks were in a scattered mood, without any appearance of handling goods, and the opening price fell by 5 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 650 yuan. Later, because the thinking of counterparts was firm, there were some buyers, and the price rose again by several yuan to 655 yuan. The trend was very flat with ups and downs of 1 to 2 yuan in the middle. The half-day transaction statistics were 1,337 bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse was flat, with little difference from the previous day. Only Tian Nu rose by 6 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 4 yuan. The factory opened 50 bales of 20-count special Jin Cheng from Yong'an Factory, with the price at 658 yuan. Yesterday, 785 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 182 pieces were shipped to Yantai, 115 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong today, and 26 pieces will be shipped to Saigon. The amount purchased by each bank is listed on the left:

Hong Kong 385 Counterparts 480 Xiamen 65

Jiangxi 70 Fuzhou 2 Inland 62

Wenzhou 25 Total 1,337

Another News: The new address of the Yarn Industry Association assembly place, after moving to the east building on the second floor of the New World on the Great Racecourse Road, is not suitable for customers and some counterparts due to the location, and there is no telephone to communicate news, so they are unwilling to participate, and separation has turned into two assembly points. Since Someone has realized that this situation is not a fundamental solution, it is now heard that they are making every effort to start a new operation, roughly recruiting at the former Dun Yu Qianzhuang store address in Tonghe Lane, Beijing Road, Ningbo Road. The house price there is very high, increasing membership fees for all counterparts to compensate. If there are no changes in the future, it should be a reality in the near future.

### Cotton Remains Unchanged

Another News: In Shanghai's foreign cotton trading, due to the loosening of exchange rates recently, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The market situation began to loosen slightly yesterday. Counterparts believe that the inventory of fine yarn in Shanghai is thin, so they have begun to order. Japanese manufacturers are also slightly moving, all for immediate loading. The possibility of a turnaround in US cotton trading in the future.

Foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market, the cotton market was very firm in the morning due to a good telegram from Liverpool. Later, because the US government's audit institute expressed dissatisfaction with the current cotton industry loan and the handling of surplus cotton, it caused the public to sell, and the market situation suddenly appeared weak. As a result, the closing price fell by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. In the Indian cotton market, although trading opened due to opposition to the resignation of the two provincial governors, there was no market price. Egyptian cotton rose by 35 pounds. Liverpool fell back by 0.03 pence at the closing.

### Local Indian Cotton Merchants Boycott Linbalili Cotton

The British newspaper North China Daily News recently published that all Indian cotton merchants in this port boycotted Linbalili cotton. According to Linbalili is a small city in India, producing a large amount of cotton annually, and selling it to all parts of India. Recently, the son of the leader, Datasaihai and Jiajisaihai, robbed women, causing public outrage. All cotton weavers and exporters in India have risen to boycott. The Linbalili authorities are now amending the law to consign to Hong Kong, but it has been opposed by Hong Kong Indian cotton merchants. Even Japanese cotton merchants are boycotting this cotton. It is reliably known that there are 532 bales of Linbalili cotton that will arrive in Shanghai on the 10th of this month, and local Indian cotton merchants have set about boycotting.

The current cotton trading is still sustainable, but large-scale transactions are still lacking, so people's hearts have no gain or loss. Japanese domestic and foreign factories enter 10 pieces of white packaged cotton, and other factories have very little vitality. Chinese factories have not adopted any single package. As for buying and selling among counterparts, it feels even more slow, so the cotton market is also trending fixed. It is necessary to wait for the yarn market to rise before there is hope of progress. Subei source, 1,180 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, 700 bales of Changyinsha, and 540 bales from Beisha. Today, 205 bales are shipped to Hong Kong, and 26 bales are shipped to Siam. The current cotton sales are listed on the left:

Tongzhou cotton 130.00-131.00 Counterparts Enter 800 bales Banknote Stack Delivery

Fire Machine Cotton 121.50-122.00 Another 600 bales Again Again

Changyinsha Packed 137.00 Domestic and Foreign Factories Enter 1,000 pieces Again Factory Delivery

### Provisions: Rice
Rice Prices Declined Across the Board for Both Japonica and Indica

The Dumi rice market presented a fluctuating situation, with both booms and busts, and unpredictability. Recently, the situation for domestic rice has been unusually complex. Regarding the source alone, it seems manipulated by some party. Exporting is sometimes smooth and sometimes obstructed. With transportation not free, it is difficult to grasp the arrival of goods. In addition, areas like Jing and Wu have entered a state of control by some party. Common hoarding households profit from this. It is hard to compare this with the stable and firm scenes of the past. Therefore, the market often changes unpredictably, causing both retailers and wholesalers, and even generally stable players, to be wary, adopting a policy of steady and sure steps, rarely taking risks or speculating. Yesterday, local stores mostly bought only to meet immediate needs, and otherwise stood by and watched. The opening market in the morning showed some vitality, with traders shouting for higher prices, but the sales market quickly weakened, showing stagnation instead. Those holding goods, wanting to sell them, had to follow the wind and lower prices to entice buyers. As a result, new Japonica and new thin rice such as "Lüjiaozhong Baige," suffered from slow sales and large inventories, with prices falling by 22-33 cents compared to the previous day. Broken Japonica and old-new converted rice also showed a softening trend. The total source for the entire market was more than 20 truckloads of goods from Sujia, Taikun, and Fengqing. Statistics showed only 5-6 thousand bags traded.

Additional news (Indica): Although Japanese merchants released some Indica yesterday, demand from rural areas inland was very strong. Inland brokers took away over 2,000 bags, so the market was not initially affected by Japonica prices. Then, Japanese merchants dumped Wu Indica, combined with a large dump of new Japonica and Lu tip rice. Market prices began to be suppressed by 12-22 cents. (Imported Rice): Yesterday, Daofu Foreign Company sold 1,500 bags of old Saigon rice from the Taikoo Warehouse for only 28.5 yuan, equivalent to only 23 yuan per stone. It was suppressed by local Indica, resulting in this low price. (Japonica Rice): Yesterday, except for the unloading of Chang Japonica being blocked and disappearing, other routes had some deliveries. Initially, Chang brokers held firm and were in demand, but then Japanese merchants dumped 6-7 thousand bags of new Japonica and Lu tip rice from the Kunshan area, each bag containing 1.3 dou of rice. New Japonica was only 25.8-26 yuan, Lu tip rice was 22.5-22.8 yuan. These were absorbed by brokerages, and the market was brought down.

### Wheat Prices Rise Another 20 Cents: Flour Not to Be Underestimated

Flour: Both the northern and southern merchants engaged in small-scale transactions. Northern merchants, in addition to purchasing artillery and naval vessel flour, also procured #4 and #5 flour. Nanyang's demand for Tianzhu flour also continued. Due to the high price of raw materials, factories remained firm in their selling intentions. The supply of returned goods was scarce. The market was secretly strong. The base price for #2 flour continued to open at 7.4 yuan, with customer prices requiring 7.5-7.6 yuan. Over 40,000 bags were traded in the entire market. The base price was still stable and not to be underestimated in the short term.

Wheat: Trading was not brisk, with both arrivals and sales low. Because sources were repeatedly obstructed and imported wheat was difficult to clear, sellers naturally held firm. However, factories, unwilling to purchase much due to high prices, only bought over 3,000 bags of Changxi and other wheat, and hoarding households pulled in 5 truckloads of Suzhou, Kunshan, and Chuzhou wheat at a price of 11.3-11.5 yuan, up about 20 cents.

Imports and Exports: Yesterday, 500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin and 5,000 bags to Tanggu. 1,350 bags of beans were shipped to Yantai, while 350 bags were shipped from Beisha. Today, there are still 3,000 bags of flour, 2,575 bags of beans, 100 bags of raw peanuts, and 150 pieces of raw oil to be shipped to Hong Kong, and 30 pieces to Siam.

### Coal: Coal Briquette Market Price Returns to Normal

Coal briquette prices, which rose repeatedly last month due to raw material shortages, have now stabilized as Hongji coal dust arrives steadily and is stockpiled in large quantities. People's confidence has stabilized, and prices have returned to normal. Common outside hoarding households are also emerging. Warehouse bills are 66 yuan, delivered by fellow traders. Large factory goods are 69 yuan per ton, wholesale to customers with a small commission. Retail at shops is around 3.6-3.7 yuan per zu (100 market catties).

### Couple's Knowledge

The misery after a couple's discord! Don't let hidden ailments, like moths, steal your future and happiness!

There are many couples who, on the surface, look no different from other ordinary couples. But under the observation of sharp eyes, whether in the wrinkles on their faces or in the attitude of their words and actions, one can see that they have a kind of hidden worry buried in their hearts, constantly eroding their bodies and minds, stealing their youth, and plunging into the miserable state of life!

In principle, a healthy couple, enjoying joy from morning till night, immersed in the atmosphere of love, giving birth to clever children, and organizing a happy family, is bound to be extremely happy! Why do they have hidden worries and fall into misery? According to medical judgment, most of the reasons lie in the man's early masturbation, spermatorrhea, or post-marital licentiousness, which consumes too much of the reproductive gland fluid, resulting in symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, disordered dreams, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging. Such a sick husband, even if he has a beautiful wife, constantly shows hypocrisy and incompetence in the life of love, or even completely unable to perform sexually. How can this not arouse the wife's hatred? When wild geese fly south and they watch the years go by, not only is her heart filled with sadness; but when the husband thinks that he is an upstanding man, why should he fail her and become a sinner in love, his eyes fill with tears, and he probably has to turn his back and shed tears in secret! As for tragedies such as elopement, divorce, suicide, and murder resulting from marital discord, they are countless in today's society!

Undoubtedly, the foundation of a couple is love, and the foundation of love is sexual health. A clever man will definitely understand this principle deeply. He will always make plans to improve his health. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" is the most cost-effective and reliable way to improve health. This preparation is made by extracting the reproductive gland essence from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, and sea dogs, and using scientific concentration and replication methods. The ingredients are completely effective and the quality is infinitely valuable. Taking it can generate sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate the blood within one day and night. It is especially valuable to take continuously, which can also help development and nourish the nerves. Those without illness can gain weight in a short period of time, prolong life, and those with the above symptoms can definitely cure various diseases and return to youth. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Himitotts Gujing Pian" to stop leakage, which will be more effective!

Patient Ren Baiming, from Anhui, 26 years old, a businessman. Early marriage caused injury, resulting in kidney deficiency and brain weakness, combined with spermatorrhea. Three years after marriage, they have never had children, and the couple's relationship is like ice and coal. He came to this clinic for treatment last month. After observing his symptoms, I immediately instructed him to purchase "Shengzhisu" and "Himitotts Gujing Pian" at Huamei Pharmacy and take them together without interruption for more than a month. New therapies such as electrotherapy injections were also applied, and he really recovered his perfect health. The couple's love has deepened, and it is said that there are signs of a promising son.

### Treatment for Deteriorated Spermatorrhea Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

A disease with no pain or itching is often the most severe disease. We can prove this by taking the nocturnal emission of young people as an example. Ignorant young people, due to the impulse of curiosity or the temptation of a bad environment, often commit masturbation habits or early marriage and licentiousness. One must know that these inappropriate sexual behaviors are most likely to damage the sexual nerves, loosen the sperm gate, and lead to terrible spermatorrhea. However, ignorant young people do not know the terror of spermatorrhea, or think that spermatorrhea is painless, and let it go on for years, or although they know that spermatorrhea is harmful, they still delay treatment. As a result, the symptoms worsen, and some go from mild nocturnal emission to severe spermatorrhea and leakage; and some, due to sperm depletion and blood exhaustion, develop brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, and other symptoms. If this kind of young person is studying at school, their studies will plummet, or they may even be unable to graduate! If they are working in the business world, they will suffer from being unable to cope due to lack of energy, or even lose their jobs! If they want to fall in love, they are often abandoned by women due to their unattractive appearance and fall into the misery of unrequited love! If they are already married, it is even more difficult for the couple to enjoy marital bliss, and various tragedies constantly arise in the family! The misery after the deterioration of spermatorrhea is simply indescribable! Early treatment of spermatorrhea is easy, but one must not take miscellaneous drugs such as "spermatorrhea pills" indiscriminately, as there is also the possibility of delaying the disease. If you take the world's only holy medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Himitotts Gujing Pian," it can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and achieve the magical effect of inducing sleep and stopping spermatorrhea. If the condition has deteriorated and there are the above symptoms, in addition to continuing to actively take "Himitotts Gujing Pian," you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (available at major pharmacies such as Zhongxi Wuzhou) to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, nourish the nerves, and help development. Continuous use will definitely cure various diseases in the short term and make the body healthier. However, if patients can come to this clinic in person and receive electrotherapy injections and other methods, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Beauty: Transforming the Breasts in Winter is the Fundamental Method

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Because the season is approaching winter, when we open the newspaper, what catches our eye, in addition to various tonic advertisements from Chinese medicine stores, are also no shortage of western medicine tonic injections, tonic pills, and ginseng and bird's nest shops' official bird's nests, white fungus, etc. These tonics certainly have their own strengths, which we will not discuss, but what I want to discuss today is the only effective tonic for women that has been overlooked and rarely advertised, and has been produced under the development of science and the flourishing of medicine.

Speaking of women's tonics, perhaps some will say: Aren't women's tonics also flooding the market, dazzling people? This is certainly true. But I want to ask: Among women's tonics, in addition to drugs that regulate menstruation, invigorate appetite, and clear leucorrhea, are there any special drugs that can adjust the various endocrine glands in the body, develop the breasts, and transform the entire health and beauty of women? If so, it is only "Shengzhisu," a reproductive gland and ovarian endocrine preparation for women invented by German physiology master Dr. Stanner. The so-called beauty and health of women, and whether the effect of taking tonics is achieved, only depends on their pair of breasts. If the breasts are high and the nipples are erect, the hips are plump, and the curves are clear, then not only will men be captivated by her, but when she goes out and socializes, she is like a flower that is both gorgeous and fragrant. Everyone hopes to get close to her fragrance and feels fortunate for three lifetimes. As for health, it can also be seen at a glance that the ovarian function is sound and the metabolism is vigorous. As for the effectiveness of taking the drug, it can be judged by whether the withered breasts are raised. This has been recognized by famous Chinese and foreign doctors throughout history, and is not comparable to hearsay. However, after taking female "Shengzhihu," they have all been able to achieve their wishes in the short term. The ingredients of female "Shengzhihu" are ovarian hormones, pituitary gland, liver paste, pancreas, and minerals such as phosphorus, calcium, and iron extracted from male and fierce animals, and precisely refined under purple light rays. Therefore, the medicinal properties are exceptionally peaceful and the effects are exceptionally great. If taken continuously during the winter storage period, not only will menstruation be regulated, complexion will be rosy, and skin will be smooth and greasy, without fear of roughness, cracks, or cold, but also the withered breasts can be raised day by day. By the time the coming spring arrives, the magnificent state of their height cannot be described in words. At this time, those who take it are surprised and sigh that it is indeed the truth for women.

### Western District's Proposal Submitted to the Puppet Government The Shanghai Municipal Council Clarifies its Position

Merely Negotiating Temporary Applicable Measures

Not Establishing a Permanent Agreement with the Puppet Government

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office issued a public announcement yesterday stating: "Yesterday (2nd) afternoon, the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Council visited the 'Mayor' Chuan Xiao'an and submitted the Council's recommendations regarding police power on extra-settlement roads in the Western District. To avoid misunderstandings, it must be stated that the Council's intention is not to establish a permanent agreement to resolve the issue of extra-settlement roads, but merely to negotiate temporary applicable measures to stop friction between the two sides and ensure the maintenance of order."

What the Shanghai Municipal Council submitted to the puppet "Municipal Government" yesterday was only the first bundle of the specific plan, the police issue portion. The Chairman, F.C. Jones, and Secretary-General, Philip, personally brought it to the "Municipal Government" in the city center at 4:30 PM yesterday and handed it over to the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an. Jones and Philip intend to first agree with Chuan on a temporary agreement regarding police power, so as to resolve all recent disputes and guarantee the restoration of law and order in the extra-settlement road area, and then discuss donations, taxes, and other issues. The Shanghai Municipal Council has maintained absolute silence on the state of yesterday's talks, making it impossible to obtain information. However, it was learned from reliable sources last night that the official negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet "Mayor" have been decided to begin early next week. Because the puppet "Mayor" cannot act alone at this time, he will first discuss the contents of the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan with the Japanese side. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Continental News published a commentary the day before yesterday, titled "The Shanghai Municipal Council Should Be More Transparent," stating that any solution to the issue of extra-settlement roads must be in cooperation with the Japanese side. The words threatened the Shanghai Municipal Council extremely and criticized the Shanghai Municipal Council for not having Japanese directors participate in the discussion when drafting the plan.

Chinese Directors Never Participated in Opinions

The Continental News reported that the shooting incident near Columbia Road on Tuesday night (1st). Yesterday (1st), it was heard that the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council have accelerated the date of submitting the proposal to "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an to resolve the dispute over extra-settlement roads. The Council remains silent on the contents of the proposal. However, it is heard that the Council directors and the consular corps here are still continuing to consider the contents of the proposal. It is also heard that the Council meeting yesterday did not discuss this matter at all, because if the discussion of the proposal was on the agenda, the Chinese and Japanese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council would be very hesitant. It was heard from the Chinese side yesterday that the Chinese directors have not participated in the discussion of the proposal so far. When reporters went to inquire, they did not express definite opinions. However, it is heard that if this matter is handed over to the Chinese directors for discussion, they will definitely oppose it due to their special status.

French Newspaper Reports Japanese News

The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 2nd that, according to Japanese sources, representatives of the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government" can negotiate this afternoon (2nd) to resolve the issue of extra-settlement roads. According to the Japanese side, the scope of this negotiation should include the expenses of road construction and drainage, the maintenance of public utilities, the rectification of taxes, and other issues. That is, all the issues previously raised by the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government" to the Shanghai Municipal Council will be discussed. As far as the Japanese side knows, on October 22, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, F.C. Jones, and the "Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government," Chuan Xiao'an, held a negotiation once at the Japanese Consulate General's Office. At that time, it was already discovered that the negotiation of this issue had a great possibility of being resolved.

Chief Patrol Yorke Denounces Rumors

The English Great American Evening News reported that Chief Patrol Yorke of the Police Department today (2nd) not only completely denied the rumor spread by the Tongmeng News Agency that the Police Department and the "Special Municipal Government" police had an incident on Columbia Road yesterday (1st) and that it was resolved after Yorke admitted that it was a mistake of the Police Department, but also said that the news was extremely absurd. The Tongmeng News Agency's news that Yorke was responsible for the "D" area is also inaccurate, because the "D" area is located in Yangshupu, while Yorke is responsible for the "B" area in western Shanghai.

### Unified Public Debt, Type D, Fixed-Term Lottery Redemption

Total principal and interest of five public debts amounts to over 56 million yuan

The eighth lottery redemption of the Unified Public Debt. The winning numbers for Types A, B, and C have all been drawn. Type D is scheduled to be held on the 10th of this month. The branch has notified the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the banking industry association to send representatives to monitor the process. The lottery for Type E is scheduled to be held on December 10. For all five types above, discounting and payment will begin at the end of January next year. The total redemption amount is 14.35 million yuan, and the interest payment is 41.9456 million yuan.

### Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes to be Printed by Mid-Month

Total amount remains 500,000 yuan

To be distributed through industry associations

After the Central Bank, pursuant to an order from the Ministry of Finance, issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, the first batch of 500,000 yuan has been issued. In view of the current high demand in the market, it has been decided to issue another 500,000 yuan. The head office has ordered the Hong Kong office to sign a continued printing contract with the American Yongning Company. Printing is already being rushed. Once printing is completed, it will be handed over to the Shanghai branch for issuance. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the second batch of fractional currency notes includes 200,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 300,000 yuan in five-cent notes. The style is exactly the same as the first batch. The contract stipulates that the goods must be delivered 20 days after the signing of the contract, which is approximately completed by the 15th of this month. The notes will be delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank in batches for gradual issuance. In order to promote widespread circulation, it has been decided to improve the issuance method and entrust the industry associations to distribute the notes to their member firms. It is heard that the industry associations have already begun registering for the collection of fractional currency notes. After the second batch of fractional currency notes is issued, they will be collected from the Central Bank and distributed to the member firms for use. As for the value coupons previously issued by the firms, they have been given a deadline to withdraw them themselves. The issuance of tokens by the concession tram company has also been suspended.

### After Tension Along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, Japanese Military Trains Arrive One After Another

Passenger trains "rest," Japanese troops head west

Japanese troops retreat from Xitang on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway

Guerrilla areas in Punan restore to original state

The situation in various towns along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has been extremely tense in the past two or three days. Kidnappings have occurred along the way in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places for days. The 12:40 passenger train from Shanghai to Nanjing the day before yesterday (1st) was temporarily suspended, and a powder sign was hung with the words "13:40 train, rest today." Therefore, rumors arose one after another, some saying that the railway was under special martial law, and others saying that trains would be suspended and traffic would be cut off.

Su took a steam car back to Shanghai. The car passed through Weiting, Zhengyi, Kunshan, Nanxiang, and other stations, and Japanese troops were seen allowing troop trains departing from Shanghai to pass. There were four such trains. However, the Japanese military police boarded the steam car and pulled down the window curtains, not allowing passengers to look out the window. There were many passengers in the car, and women and children were all panicked.

No Pedestrians Along the Road

The various townships of Xin Zhuang, Mei Long, and other places in the suburbs of Shanghai have been implementing martial law and conducting strict inspections for days due to the Japanese military's troop movements. Villagers approaching the railway line are often shot. Therefore, the small roads near the railway have been almost deserted and unusually desolate. It is also heard that the plainclothes team formerly in the Guanshengyuan Farm, whose name was "People's Peace Self-Defense Corps," numbering about a hundred people, was led by Tao Mou the day before yesterday and patrolled the town with the Japanese military police team. Now, posts are stationed at the main intersections of the Shanghai-Min Road to protect and defend.

Chasing Japanese Troops in Xitang

After the Japanese military police garrison at Fengjing Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was surrounded by Chinese regular troops and two foreign-style bridges on the railway were destroyed, the Japanese troops destroyed Xitang Town. Now, according to continuous news obtained from the navigation industry, the Japanese troops entrenched in Xitang, after being engaged by the Chinese 30th Division, were driven back to Jiaxing. The Chinese troops intercepted them section by section along the way, abandoning many corpses and weapons, suffering heavy losses.

Guerrilla Team Moved

Punan is the base area for guerrilla teams. Previously, due to the puppet "Fengxian County Administration Chief" Xu Chao (i.e., Xu Zijiang) leading Japanese troops to occupy Nanquan Town and recruiting salt smugglers and local ruffians in the name of the already executed puppet "Deputy Commander of the 3rd District Pacification," Li Tianmin, the guerrilla team suffered greatly in the past three months. In addition, with Yu Tao Sheng Lai Shanghai, Zhang Fan shaking, only Ding Xu Gu Xi four units hard to engage, located in the sea corner, most of them moved towards Shanghai-Hangzhou Road and Su-Jia Road. However, now the Commander of the 3rd War Zone specially selected the entire old Independent 45th Brigade (now expanded into a division, divided into three brigades: 33rd, 35th, and 37th), and the 62nd Division, first occupied the entire Zhapu and Pinghu (except for the city walls), driving out the Japanese troops and reaching Punan directly. As far as the military order reached, Zhang Huifang, Li Wenyuan, Xu Zhifei, and Zhang Miaogen's units were all affected. The Japanese troops retreated one after another. Therefore, the two corridors of Pudong and Shangchuan Road, the Shangnan Road area, and the Duxing Zhagang Tangkou opposite Minhang, the guerrilla team has restored its original strength.

### Japanese "Hengchan Company" Encircled the General Public

Owners Do Not Pay Attention

Digging Soil and Bombing Workers to Death

The "Shanghai Hengchan Company," established with Japanese investment, first started operating real estate business, arbitrarily encircling civilian land in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas to build houses for profit. This method of trading empty and buying empty is being actively promoted, and countless original landowners will lose their property rights one after another. The details are recorded as follows.

Only Debt Certificates Paid for State-Owned and Civilian Land

A person named Xu Tingsheng had four or five mu of land in a certain place in northern Shanghai. Because the land was located in an important location, it was coveted by the Hengchan Company. The company erected fences around the land and circled it for use, and was about to build houses. After hearing about it, Xu tried to negotiate with the company, unwilling to sell. Unexpectedly, Hirai, a Japanese section chief of the Hengchan Company, arbitrarily assessed the value of the land at 5,364.4 yuan, ordering Xu to first take 364.4 yuan in cash, and pay 5,000 yuan in a blank non-cashable debt certificate. Xu was extremely angry and refused to accept both the cash and the debt certificate, entrusting the ownership of his inherent land to fate.

Building Houses and Artillery Wounds People

The Hengchan Company also encircled more than ten mu of farmland in the name of a certain surname near the "Dadao Municipal Government" in the city center, surrounded it with fences, and hired many coolies for days, preparing the ground in order to start building houses. At noon the day before yesterday, three coolies dug up a shell in the swamp on the land, touched the mechanism, and suddenly exploded. With a loud bang, the surrounding areas were shaken. The "Dadao Municipal Government" Chuan Xiao'an and other people were suspected of causing trouble and were greatly panicked. It was not until the cause was found out that they could breathe a sigh of relief. When the shell exploded, two coolies were bombed to death on the spot, and another coolie had a leg blown off. After being sent to the Fumin Hospital run by the Japanese in Hongkou for treatment, he died of breathlessness yesterday morning.

### EUROPEAN ARMISTICE ANNIVERSARY - THIS YEAR, DIM AND COLORLESS

Shanghai British Community to Hold Simple Ceremony

Donations to be Collected to Aid Soldiers' Families

With the Second World War erupting following the deterioration of relations between Germany and Poland, and both sides exchanging heavy artillery fire, the British community in Shanghai will hold the "European Armistice Anniversary" on the [blank]th of this month. Given the extraordinary times, this year's remembrance ceremony will be somewhat restrained. At 8:30 AM on that day, led by Mr. Aitken, Chairman of the British Victory Association, a wreath made of poppy flowers will be presented to the

Goddess of Peace

on the Bund. Members of the association and other British expatriates wishing to participate can wear their medals or awards and gather at the statue of the Goddess of Peace at 8:10 AM. The ceremony is said to be very simple. At 10:45 AM, a meeting will be held at the British Church at 219 Jiujiang Road, presided over by the Reverend Chatfield. At 11:00 AM sharp, there will be three minutes of silence, followed by a performance by the pipe band of the 1st Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders. All British expatriates wishing to participate are welcome; however, seating will not be reserved. After the ceremony, participants are asked to make a donation to support the British Victory Association. The traditional meal for British veterans will reportedly be canceled this year. The open

sale of poppy flowers

on the streets to the general public will also be discontinued this year. If British expatriates need these flowers or wish to give them to friends, they can obtain them free of charge from the British Victory Association on Jiujiang Road before next Tuesday. Special poppy flowers for decorating cars or display tables can also be obtained from the association. Wreaths for car decoration will be exhibited on the 11th, as usual. Those who want them need not pay, but a small donation is required to help the families of those who sacrificed their lives in the war who are living in Shanghai. It is said that these poppy wreaths, although distributed by the association, come from London, England, and are worth several times more than those in Shanghai. Therefore, charitable donations will also be increased. On the day of the Armistice Remembrance, the British Victory Association will urge all British expatriates to wear wreaths throughout the day to commemorate the honored souls of the war dead.

### A DAZZLING ARRAY OF EXHIBITS - LANGUAGE EXHIBITION OPENS TODAY

Nearly All Chinese and Western Ancient Treasures Have Been Collected

Bo Fangji, Lin Kanghou, and Others to Preside Over the Opening Ceremony

The Language Exhibition, prepared for months by local social celebrities and language experts, is scheduled to open at 9:00 AM today on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road. The opening ceremony will be presided over by Messrs. Bo Fangji, Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Lu Gaoyi, who will also deliver speeches. Invitations were distributed yesterday, inviting people from all walks of life to visit. The exhibits began to be displayed yesterday afternoon. In addition to the items submitted earlier, many more items were received yesterday from all sectors of society.

Exquisite and Rare

Unseen Before, such as Zhang Feng's Western postal wooden slips, Shi Ni's Qin and Han tile ends, Ding Fubao's ancient coins and books, Jin Nigao's "Xi Ru Er Mu Zi" (Aids to the Eye and Ear of Western Scholars), Zheng Zhenduo's Matteo Ricci's phonetic script, Zhang Ruogu's Mongolian sand king's new pen Mongolian script, Qu Xihua's Xue Qing Stele inscriptions, Xingdao's phonetic script, Zhou Yueran's

Song and Yuan Fine Editions

of Mang Jing and other versions, as well as the English convert to Chinese Ma Binhe's imitation of Yi script, the Ceylon palm-leaf scriptures from the Xuantong Astronomical Church Library, French versions of the Four Books and Five Classics, Mongolian version of the Suvarnaprabhasa Sutra, the Bible Society's Bibles in 692 languages and language tables in 972 languages, huge Wei Dynasty steles, Tang Dynasty handwritten scriptures, texts on Six Dynasties Buddhist statues, etc., are a feast for the eyes. There are also Liu Zhi's bronze tripods and the antiques from the Irene Garden, etc., which are especially precious and will be delivered this morning. The venue is divided into special exhibition rooms according to the exhibits: Religion, Inscriptions, Performances, Oracle Bones, Ancient Coins, Books, Irene Garden, and others. Because the exhibition received a large number of items, but the venue is too small, some lightweight items will be displayed in rotation. In addition to the daily opening of the

Exhibition

at 9:00 AM, various performances will be held in the afternoon. The association has also printed and is selling at the venue the three books it has compiled, "Chinese Writing Forms," "Chinese Phonetics," and "Phonetic Scripts Since the Ming Dynasty." A catalog of exhibits is also available for guests to refer to, so that people can have a deep understanding of Chinese language. The books are sold for five cents each at the Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, Medical Book Company, and at the exhibition venue. In recent days, the crowds of buyers have been extremely large, which shows that the people of Shanghai want to feast their eyes on this.

### JAPANESE WARSHIP SHELLS LONGSHAN

According to shipping industry news, on the morning of the 29th, at 9:00 AM, a Japanese warship sailed to the Longshan sea area, which belongs to Zhenhai County, and continuously fired at the shore, with as many as 27 shells. The damage was minimal. After shelling, the Japanese warship immediately sailed to the [blank] port sea area outside Zhenhai and anchored. The Zhenhai Fortress has been monitoring it. The Longshan pier was thoroughly destroyed by the stationed army last winter.

### HSBC ABSORBS FOREIGN EXCHANGE - MARKET REMAINS STEADY

Showing Stability of Public Sentiment, Contrary to Past Practice

Hong Kong Capital Flows to Shanghai, Strengthening Foreign Exchange Reserves

Regarding the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange, it has been manipulated by speculators, resulting in unprecedentedly low exchange rates. Now, thanks to the government's successful control of trade, imported goods are scarce, and exports of domestic goods have increased. The Hong Kong government's implementation of wartime commercial controls has caused capital from Hong Kong to flow to Shanghai. At the same time, exporters in Shanghai are selling the foreign exchange they earn to the black market, and importers in Shanghai are continuously selling the foreign exchange they earn to the black market. Hong Kong speculators' consistently aggressive buying has caused the black market for foreign exchange to ease unprecedentedly. HSBC Bank's listings have been repeatedly lengthened, and the price of the Chinese yuan in Shanghai has risen invisibly. Those operating long positions are discouraged and helpless, and every day, suppliers flood the market. Small-scale foreign exchange hoarders are numerous. Confidence in the Chinese yuan arises spontaneously, further contributing to its strength. Last week, HSBC Bank tried to buy British foreign exchange, purchasing a considerable amount at 4 and 625/1000 pence, but it had no effect on the market. In the past, the market was always alarmed whenever HSBC intervened, and sellers immediately retreated. Now, this is not the case, which shows how much the market psychology has changed. As for remittances from overseas Chinese, in the past, they were remitted to Hong Kong, but now, due to Hong Kong's controls, the remittances are rerouted to Shanghai, and funds are flowing into Shanghai.

### WINTER WIND SEASON - DIFFICULTIES WITH BARGE TRANSPORT IN ZHENHAI

According to shipping industry news, the number of barges in Zhenhai had gradually increased to more than 100 a month ago. Each ship was unloading in sequence, which was sufficient to manage. However, as the season has entered late autumn, the area outside the Zhenhai port is an area with many islands. Every autumn rain season, northwesterly winds blow from all directions, and the wind is very strong. As barges have limited load capacity, they cannot sail outside the port when it is windy. Therefore, in the past month, barge unloading has often stopped due to the wind, causing voyages to be significantly delayed. Currently, shipping companies are jointly discussing ways to improve the situation, so that voyages are not affected by the winter wind season.

### PATROL DUTIES AT THE THREE FLOATING WHARVES TRANSFERRED TO THE WATER POLICE

Solely Responsible for Boat and Ship Issues at the Wharves

Police Investigations Still Under the Jurisdiction of the Police Department

—All Cases to Be Tried by the Special Court—

According to the Continental Daily News, from yesterday (the 1st), the Water Police took over the patrol duties of the 9th, 10th, and 11th floating wharves in front of the Customs wharf from the Police Department. However, the scope of activities of both parties will not be affected by this patrol duty. Police investigations matters occurring on the floating wharves themselves will be handled by the Police Department, while issues concerning boats and ships moored near the wharves will be managed by the Water Police. All cases, whether in the river or on the wharves, will continue to be tried by the Special District Court. Since the landing places along the Bund have been restricted, and there are many boats and ships requesting temporary mooring, the Water Police had previously limited small boats wanting to pick up passengers on the Bund to ten minutes. However, many small boats moored for longer than the time limit. Therefore, it is more convenient if the police officers of the Water Police, who are responsible for boats and ships, patrol the floating wharves.

### STREET FLOODING SITUATION THIS YEAR

The Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek Have Been Neglected for Too Long

The City's Ground Level Is Also Gradually Declining

The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council Seeks Ways to Improve

In recent years, several parts of the concession south of the Suzhou Creek have often been flooded, causing inconvenience to pedestrians and vehicles. The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has prepared a dredging plan and submitted it to the Public Works Committee for review. The reasons for street flooding can be summarized in two points: one is high river levels, and the other is excessive rainfall. The situation is described in detail below:

High River Levels

The flooding caused by the rising water of the Suzhou Creek has a profound impact on areas close to the Huangpu River or the Suzhou Creek, especially the area between Henan Road and the Bund, and near the three major companies on Nanjing Road. Several parts of the northern district are also slightly affected. The Public Works Department began to reconstruct the Lixia Road between Henan Road and the Bund several years ago, raising the road surface. However, due to the high cost and obstruction of traffic, the reconstruction project was suspended in 1936. However, the manholes in the area have been fitted with valves to prevent backflow of river water, and a seawall has been built along the Bund. The Public Works Department has also installed a pump to drain the water when the manholes are blocked. These measures cost little but have a great effect. The ten flood-prevention measures have been implemented two or three times this year, with five times not being fully effective. Of these five times, four were due to excessive rainfall, which exceeded the pumping capacity. The other time occurred on the night of August 19th. That day, the river water was about four feet above the ground at midnight, but by 8:00 AM the next morning, it had all receded. On the 17th of last month, the river water was about one foot above the lowest part of the concession, but thanks to the appropriate measures taken by the Public Works Department, the concession was not affected. The ground around the three major companies on Nanjing Road is low, so tidal water easily flows through the drains to the ground. The remedy is to install spherical valves on the drains. However, during high tide, if there is too much rainwater or water pouring into the drains, the streets will flood and it will be difficult to drain. The Public Works Department has now introduced a method to drain the street water to the nearest drain pumping station and has installed a special pump for use. Several parts of the northern district are sometimes affected by tidal water. To remedy this, the drain openings have been fitted with spherical valves.

Excessive Rainfall

The city's ground level is low, and street flooding is inevitable if there is several inches of rain within a few hours. In the past two years, the flooded area has become wider and the duration longer. The reason for this is that the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek have not been dredged for a long time, and the city's ground level is also declining. The western district's boundary roads have seen a sudden development of industry, which is not controlled by the Public Works Department, and the drainage outlets of the French Concession (which are connected to the drains of the Public Concession on Avenue Foch) are not easily maintained in perfect condition. In June of last year, there was a heavy rain, the amount of which was the highest since 1875. The chief engineer of the French Concession's municipal authority, in light of the situation at the time, drafted a plan. This plan requires larger water pipes and several large-scale pumping stations. If its scope is extended to all parts south of the Suzhou Creek, up to the railway line, it will require an investment of 60 million yuan and take at least ten years to complete. The current measures taken by the Public Works Department cannot completely prevent street flooding when there is excessive rainfall, but they do reduce its depth, width, and duration. The western district and the roads outside the western district are most affected by rainwater. These areas lack proper drainage facilities, and in recent years, many ponds and river channels have been filled to create small plots of land, so the outlet for rainwater is reduced. The roads on the border of the concession's western section are therefore often flooded. The area of the roads outside the western district is not much different from that of the concession, so its impact is clear. Although there has not been as much rain in the past two years as there was in June of last year, the western district is continuing to develop, and the number of uncontrolled buildings is increasing. The Public Works Department believes that it is necessary to improve the drainage facilities as much as possible, but the cost should be as economical as possible. As for all the existing drains, in addition to being cleaned at all times, the Public Works Department has paid special attention to them. The department has hired an additional engineer and an assistant to specialize in drainage matters. It has also added equipment to quickly remove silt from the drains. The amount of sludge removed from the manholes used to be about 20 tons per month, but since the installation of the above equipment, it has increased to 600 tons. All the main drains in the areas that are most easily flooded were quite clean this summer. At the beginning of this year, a new large drain was laid on Avenue Grande Occidentale (from Rue Amiral Bayle to Columbia Road). Recently, a new water pipe has been laid on Columbia Road to drain the floodwater from Rue Annam to the Fa Hua Creek. Another water pipe has also been laid to drain the floodwater from the lower part of Route Tenant de la Tour to the large water pipe on Avenue Haig. The lowest part of Route Cardinal Mercier, about 1,500 feet, is being rebuilt. These measures have been effective, but it is still difficult to prevent street flooding when there is excessive rainfall. Currently, residents of the western district often feel inconvenienced by street flooding after heavy rains. This shortcoming must be remedied by thoroughly renovating the drains. A more convenient method is to directly connect the drain water to the Suzhou Creek, but the area between the border of the concession and the railway line is large, and some parts of the road surface must be raised, which will cost as much as 800,000 yuan. Moreover, before this plan can be implemented, the relevant authorities must allow cooperation. At the same time, the Public Works Department must find ways to prevent the flooding in the western district from spilling into the concession, otherwise it will be useless.

On the 27th of last month, the Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting and carefully considered all the facts regarding the above-mentioned plans. As a result, it was decided to recommend to the council that it take all possible measures within reasonable limits next year. As for the plans that should not be held at present, the above recommendations have been approved by the council. Thereafter, the routine work of the Public Works Department will continue. The pumping system can eliminate the floodwater in the western district. After the improvements, the drainage volume has increased by about 100,000 gallons per hour. In addition, there are other measures that can significantly improve the situation in the western district if there is excessive rainfall.

### ARMED ROBBERY AT A COTTON CLOTH SHOP ON ZILAI STREET - DETECTIVES AND ROBBERS FIGHT - ONE ROBBER KILLED AND FOUR CAPTURED

Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, an armed robbery and shooting occurred in the French Concession on Zilai Street. The details are as follows:

Equipped with a Burglar Alarm

Wang Huiming, from Suzhou, runs the Jinchang Shenji Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 14, Lane 43 (Shenxing Lane), Zilai Street, French Concession. Tang Guozhu, from Pudong, serves as the manager. The shop is equipped with a burglar alarm connected to No. 17 next door and then to the French police station, for security against burglaries.

Robbery in the Early Morning

Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, shortly after the shop staff got up, seven robbers, armed with a Mauser pistol and a handgun, broke into the shop, confined everyone, and proceeded to rob it. They took over a thousand yuan in cash from the desk. At that moment, the shop manager secretly pressed the burglar alarm. The police station received the alert and immediately dispatched a large team of detectives to search and arrest the robbers.

Resisting Arrest with Gunfire

The detectives, led by Chinese Detective Dai Rongji and including Detectives Zhang Dongcheng, Ni Jinrong, and Chen Fusheng, arrived at the shop to apprehend the robbers. As the detectives were about to enter, the robbers came out. Seeing the detectives arriving, they opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives returned fire. More than ten shots were fired in total. As a result, one of the robbers, Yang Da'yan from Jiangbei, was shot in the leg while trying to climb the wall to escape and fell to the ground, where he was captured.

Netting the Entire Gang

In addition, four other robbers were captured on the spot. Over one thousand yuan in stolen cash, a Mauser pistol, and twenty-five rounds of ammunition were confiscated. Two other robbers fled eastward. The detectives chased after them, and one robber was shot and killed at the intersection of Jixiang Street. The remaining robber escaped without a trace. Five robbers, as well as the stolen goods and ammunition, were taken to the police station, to be sent to the Second Special Court today for legal prosecution.

### DANCER ABANDONED - SUES FOR RECOGNITION OF DAUGHTER - DEFENDANT ORDERED TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT

Xue Meiying, a 24-year-old dancer from Nanjing, was once married but unfortunately lost her husband early. Unable to bear widowhood, she left her marriage and worked as a dancer in Shanghai. Last year, at a dance hall, she met Li Xianglu, a dance patron from Guangdong (currently a comprador at a foreign company), who was in his thirties. They fell in love at first sight and soon began living together. Before long, Xue became pregnant. Li, upon hearing the news, was not only not happy but worried, and he resolutely abandoned Xue, never returning. Xue gave birth to a daughter a few months later. Having been out of work for a long time, she was struggling financially. She hired a lawyer to sue Li in the First Special Court, demanding recognition of the daughter as his own and requesting an order for child support of over 16,000 yuan. Judge Li Humin heard the case several times, summoning relevant witnesses to court and conducting a detailed investigation. Yesterday, the court ruled that the daughter born to the plaintiff was the defendant's biological daughter and ordered the defendant to pay child support of 20 yuan per month. The rest of the plaintiff's claims were dismissed.

### FOREMAN EXTORTS FACTORY OWNER

The metal manufacturing factory at No. 8, Lane 39, Connaught Road, was founded by Xu Yuan, from Ningbo. The factory employs hundreds of workers. Recently, the factory temporarily suspended work because the orders from the contracted clients had been completed. Wu Ali, a foreman from Wuxi, took the opportunity to extort 400 yuan from the factory owner Xu Yuan as dismissal fees for the workers, causing trouble for Xu. The matter was settled with 50 yuan. However, the money was embezzled by a Mr. Yin, who is on the run. At 5:30 PM on the 24th of last month, Wu Ali gathered a group of over ten people and went to the factory again to demand money from Xu Yuan. He assaulted Xu and threatened to harm Xu if his demands were not met. The case was reported, and the police from Gordon Road arrested Wu Ali and brought him to the First Special District Court for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui continued the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that Mr. Yin and Wu's accomplices could not be arrested and requested prosecution. When questioned, the defendant insisted that he had not received any of the 50 yuan dismissal fee given by the factory and had resorted to this tactic to seek leniency. Judge Liu sentenced Wu Ali to three months in prison as a warning.

### DANCER BURNS HER ADOPTED DAUGHTER - INJURIES VERIFIED - DEFENDANT DETAINED FOR INVESTIGATION

Chen Meiying (also known as Chen Meibao), a 30-year-old woman from Guangdong, used to work as a dancer. She met and cohabited with YCO, a Filipino musician, at Room 12, Apartment 52, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. Two years ago, she adopted a nine-year-old girl, Chen Sandi. However, Chen was usually violent and often

Beat the Girl

Recently, she escalated her abuse, using cigarette burns on various parts of the girl's hands, legs, face, and ears. Outraged, someone reported the abuse to the police. Detective Ter of the West Police Station and Chinese Detective San Daotou No. 1013 arrested Chen Meiying, along with Chen Sandi, and took them to the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Jiang Baoli, filed a public prosecution for abuse under Article 286 of the Criminal Code and stated the details of the case, saying that after the police received the report, they

Immediately Investigated

They learned that the second landlord was You Laosan, who used the premises as an apartment and rented it out separately. Room 12 was rented by the defendant and a Filipino. At that time, because there were American interests involved, the police did not make an arrest. They contacted the American Consul to confirm that the defendant was still of Chinese nationality and then arrested her. At that time, only the girl Chen Sandi was in the room. She was pale, malnourished, and had cigarette

Burns on Her Face, Ears, Hands, and Legs

Later, they learned that the defendant was gambling at mahjong at No. 25 in the same lane and arrested her there. The defendant admitted to the burns at the police station, but the Filipino was her accomplice and had incited her. Further investigation was needed. He requested that the case be postponed. Judge Xiao Peishen and Prosecutor Song Genshan examined the injuries in court and questioned Chen Sandi, who testified that she was burned three

Times with Cigarettes for Misbehaving. When Chen Meiying was questioned, she admitted that she lived with the Filipino and had adopted Chen Sandi two years ago. She had burned her with cigarettes because she disobeyed and she had a bad temper, but it was only one time. The court ordered the defendant to be detained pending further questioning and postponed the hearing for seven days. The girl was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.

Guo Cai, a Cantonese woman, forty-four years old, lives in the garret on the second floor. A set of her wedding attire, hanging behind the door in her room, was stolen on the morning of the 30th of last month at 10:00 AM. She immediately reported this to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. The investigation revealed that it was stolen by her neighbor, Yan Li, who pawned it for ten yuan. Li was arrested, and the pawn ticket was found. The stolen goods were retrieved. She was brought to the Second Special District Court yesterday. After questioning by Judge Wu, Li's statements were evasive. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning. The defendant was detained.

### No Progress in Negotiations for Detained Portuguese Ships

Regarding the negotiations for the release of more than ten Portuguese merchant ships, including the Tang Qiao Tang Bei Tang Lumei Da Li Bao, a reporter from Daguan News Agency specially inquired with shipping industry yesterday. There is no matter of organizing a Sino-Portuguese shipping company. Regarding the detained Portuguese ships, the Japanese side has repeatedly expressed its willingness to release them, but only on the condition that they register with the pseudo "Maritime Administration Bureau" and cooperate with the Japanese side in operation. The Portuguese merchants are unwilling to accept this and resolutely reject it, resulting in a prolonged delay. However, diplomatic channels are still being used to continue negotiations. However, the Hailong vessel of the Atlantic Shipping Company, which was detained on April 5th of this year along with other Portuguese ships, was released on the 21st of last month. It immediately sailed to the French-owned Quxin Shipyard in Nanshi to enter the dock for inspection of the hull and repair of the machinery. The work has now been completed. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 1st), it left the dock and sailed back to the buoys at Nos. 29 and 30 Yangshupu, where the deck passenger seats will be repaired and repainted. The routes it will travel after completion are currently undecided. The Hailong is the first of the detained Portuguese vessels to be released, and negotiations for the remaining vessels are still underway.

### One of the Shanghai Hundred Views The Mysterious Medicinal Plaster Shop A Confession of a Trier

— Zi Hong

When you are so sick that there is no other way, even the aspiring scholars will pray to the Bodhisattva. My back has been aching for several days and it has not gotten any better. Forcing myself, I barged into that plaster shop I did not believe in. When I saw the tiger skin hanging on the wall, I felt as if I was being sent into the tiger's mouth.

Green wine bottles, red plasters, big pythons, and small monkeys, the whole place was filled with the atmosphere of a traveling salesman. The man with the chubby cheeks came up to me and asked about the source of the illness, and patting my stomach, said loudly: "Treat it quickly! Treat it quickly! This is madness."

Inexplicably, a plaster was stuffed into my hand, considered the cheapest price, one yuan. The plaster read "Secretly Made Magical Panacea". The man slapped me on the shoulder, which was really unbearable. It hurt so much that I could hardly breathe, but he grinned and shouted: "Friend, I guarantee it will work, and if it doesn't, I'll refund your money!"

I spent the night in groans, and the mystery did not work, but it hurt so much that it swelled up. Remembering that he said "no charge for additional medicine", I barged in again. Before I could say three words, he acted like a fortune teller, asking me to stretch out my hand to look at, pressed my nails and said: "Your illness is severe and the medicine is light. You should use a refined musk plaster, five yuan each." Then he saw that I didn't look like I was going to buy it, and said again: "Return the old plaster to me, and I'll give you one yuan off. We're honest businessmen, aren't we?"

"Come, I'll give you a few injections and apply some medicine, and I guarantee you'll be completely cured!" As he said this, there was also a patient at the door using a very long needle to stab his leg. I trembled a little. Although he said there would be no charge, I declined and left immediately.

"Then drink some Madness Chasing Medicine Wine, two yuan and forty cents a catty. Internal drinking, external plaster, internal and external response, I guarantee you'll be completely cured!" I admired how many methods he had to guarantee a cure.

I was a little scared when I saw the green wine and red cap. I quickly said: "I don't drink wine."

"You don't drink? You have to drink even if you don't drink when you're sick. I'm not asking you to drink it all in one gulp. You can use it in your dishes or rice. You don't drink?"

"I didn't bring much money."

"How much money did you bring? Buy a little less, six cents okay?"

"You said that if the plaster doesn't work, you'll refund my money. Today you said that the pores open on the first day, the medicine will work on the second day, and it will be completely cured on the third day. Then please add some medicine, and I'll come back to ask for your advice in three days."

"I said how much money did you bring? I said a one yuan plaster is not a panacea. There are good ones: five yuan, ten yuan. I think you should still drink some medicinal wine. How much money did you bring?"

"Only twenty cents! I don't drink wine, is it okay to buy twenty cents?" I said on purpose.

"Okay, I don't want your money!" He pulled a face and shouted, telling me to take off my coat and stand at the door. Surrounded by many onlookers, he shook my arm as if it was nothing, then hooked my arm back and carried me on his back, then grabbed my arm and picked me up as if I were a flat ancestor. I shouted, and the little monkey even tore my clothes. He laughed in public and said: "Young man, you can't stand this little bit of hardship. I guarantee you'll be okay, I won't charge you a penny, go!" He slapped me on the back. I was in so much pain that I couldn't speak, and I slipped away as if I had escaped from the tiger's mouth. I could still hear him say behind me: "Problem, I won't charge you a penny, I guarantee you'll be okay!"

Chapter 17: Learning Field Work, Reporters Enter New Territory, Studying Internal Affairs, Learning to Line Up in the Little Schoolyard

This shows that the genius of a journalist is indeed an important part, and it is also difficult to force it for a while. Miss Shao Huihua was born with journalistic talent. When she was sixteen years old, she was still studying at school, and she could interview important news and run a wall newspaper. She could actually obtain news that others could not. Even if she competed with her classmates to win, to probe into a secret piece of news, it was just for fun, she could also win and be a host. Many classmates said that she had the skills of a detective, and she could be a female detective in the future and contribute to the country. But she did not admit to such words. She said: News investigation cannot be equated with being a detective. Often being a detective or a spy is a kind of secret work, often using cunning means, for an important document, even to the point of coercion and plunder, which is not right. As for collecting news, that is a matter of being upright and upright. The news obtained must be publicized to the public and disclosed to the world. It is really a sacred job. Moreover, being a detective or a spy inevitably has a sense of enemy and me, which exists in between. If it is the work of news investigation, it is not like this. Some news releases must be approved by the other party before they can be disclosed. There is also the fact that a piece of news has a great relationship with timeliness. In addition to talent, it is necessary to talk about cultivation. If you only have talent and do not cultivate it, you will often be misled by talent, and even go astray, which is very dangerous. But what is the method of cultivation? This question is too big! To put it simply, morality is a circle drawn for talented people. No matter how talented you are, you cannot jump out of the circle of morality. Naturally, a person always has a sense of justice. If talent jumps out of the scope of justice, that talent will cause trouble. The key is common sense. How to say that common sense is rich and common sense is shallow, this is progressing with the times. Common sense is like the capital of a capitalist. In the past, this little bit of capital was already enough, but in today's world, this little bit of capital is felt to be insufficient. Because the times are progressing, all kinds of things have become complicated. Originally, the little bit of common sense that I knew felt very rich, but now the things that should be known should be added more. If you don't understand this, and you don't understand that, it will clearly show that you are poor in knowledge. Moreover, a journalist is a large treasure house of common sense. It is really as said in ancient novels: he knows astronomy above, understands geography below, and is proficient in the three teachings and nine streams. It was already necessary to do so in ancient times, let alone in modern times? This is already the case for an ordinary person who stands in society, let alone a journalist? (198)

### Please Pay Attention, Parents

— Shu

It is already late autumn, and the children have all put on their woolen clothes. Accordingly, the swindlers who "peel the frogs" that come with the season have also come on the market. Everyone is also warning parents not to let their children go to the streets. Shanghai's society is full of traps. Swindlers who trick children out of woolen shirts and the like seem to be nothing to write about. For example, the news recently advertised in the newspapers about children being abducted and shipped overseas is even more difficult to prevent. Therefore, the thing I want to ask parents to pay attention to is not to guard against swindlers, but to pay attention to the actions of children on the streets.

Children are active, and keeping them at home is not a good idea, especially in the inch-gold land of the "isolated island". Within the fortress,

### Establishing Grain Storage

— Zhang Zhenshan

Some time ago, when rice prices soared, which had a serious impact on general social life, everyone seemed to comfort themselves by hoping for smooth sources and thicker stocks. However, the facts proved that the obstacles to the source were not very serious, and the stocks were not thin, but prices still did not fall back, and they hoped for the new grain to come on the market. Now that the new grain has come on the market, rice prices remain the same. In a helpless state, this kind of social fear and worry is especially overflowing in everyone's words.

However, expectations are empty, and fear and worry do not help the facts. Now, the First Special District Citizens' Federation has suggested to the Public Concession Board of Works and the French Concession Board of Directors to collect and transport a large amount of national rice from the producing areas at the time when new grain is coming on the market, and set up public warehouses within the concessions to implement storage for future needs, so that rice prices will continue to fall. The two concession authorities have accepted this suggestion because it is reasonable.

Although this is a stopgap measure, it can prevent future panic if implemented. We try to deduce the future illusion of the time when new grain is on the market and when there is no grain, and after shivering, we naturally hope that it will be realized as soon as possible. At present, the general poor coolies, under the heavy burden of life, are already unable to breathe. For those who rely on labor to live, getting enough to eat in a day is really great luck! Moreover, there are even more people who cannot get enough to eat, who cry to each other with the ox-coat, and who let the social environment control their fate! Their plight is deepening with the passage of time. If rice prices continue to rise, the future miserable situation of the middle and lower classes will be even worse than today. This is unbearable to imagine, right? Therefore, establishing grain storage is an urgent need in a helpless environment.

This method of establishing grain storage, after the planning of the concession authorities, will naturally not be a problem for sufficient funds and large warehouse locations. However, if the quantity is sufficiently expanded, then the method of no-interest investment by citizens may not fail to achieve considerable good results.

Since it is said to be "no interest", why would anyone invest? Are you joking? Actually, no. For example: the competent authority for establishing grain storage collects citizen investment, stipulates that it starts from five yuan or ten yuan, or a certain amount, does not give interest, but gives priority to future flat whips, and in the future, it can receive the amount of rice equal to the amount of the receipt. In the unpredictable evolution of the social environment, in case of a severe stage of rice shortage, investors can be confident (if they hoard themselves, they cannot purchase directly from the producing area, so there is no cheap price). In this way, the enthusiasm for investment is indeed expected, right?

As for public warehouses, if land is purchased and built, it seems that the cost will be increased, and it is more economical to rent various spare warehouses and the like. As for dredging the source, cracking down on hoarding households, monitoring manipulation, etc., it is hoped that they will also be carried out at the same time, so as to achieve a two-pronged harvest.

Seeing children making trouble everywhere, many parents ask them to play in the alleyways or on the streets. Some, as mentioned in an article in this magazine a few days ago, send them to school to "confine the barbarians". Naturally, children born into unfortunate families are ultimately unfortunate. Those who can be sent to school to "confine the barbarians" are at least the lucky ones who can receive education. In fact, letting them out of the small room and getting a larger place to play, which suits their active personality, is not necessarily a good place for those who do not have a garden and do not have the power to send them to kindergarten. But we have to see what they are doing in the alleyways or on the streets? Playing marbles and gambling at candy stalls are good; associating with hooligans and learning various curses and fights are also everywhere. Parents don't know what they do outside every day. Being able to avoid the noise in the house is all they care about. In this way, they sink into a bad environment and get used to all the bad things. They are already unfortunate to be born into such families. Won't they be even more unfortunate in the future and become useless people in society? Therefore, I think it is a problem worth paying attention to not letting children go to the alleyways and street corners, but the educational work of correcting what they do in the alleyways and street corners is even more worthy of attention!

### Wireless Film Advertising

— Xin Ying

We all know that wireless broadcasting has become an advertising tool today. General merchants use wireless broadcasting to promote themselves. They constantly broadcast from the radio station to announce how good the quality of their goods is and how cheap the sale is, as well as the news of big discounts and big sales.

Based on this fact, after the wireless radio and movies become popular, in addition to providing entertainment for people, like wireless radio broadcasting, it will definitely be used by merchants as an advertising tool; and in fact, Hollywood film companies have taken the lead in using wireless movies as an advertising tool for films.

The blockbuster "Gungadin", which was released in Shanghai, used wireless movies as an advertisement in New York and London after it was completed. Paramount has also expressed that from now on, all new films will be advertised by wireless radio throughout the United States.

Because wireless movies are still new, the states in America have not yet imposed commercial control. At the same time, the current notes issued are considered by the authorities to be non-commercial, so whether it is legal is still a question.

The National Broadcasting Company in America plans to promote wireless movie advertising; therefore, it is planning to distribute an extremely small booklet called "Wireless Movie Advertising," preparing to distribute 5,200 copies every week, so that merchants can use sound and images to advertise and promote their goods, and naturally get better results.

### Hong Kong Film Circle Miscellany

— Cui Ping

Cheng Bugao, the famous director now serving in the Political Department of the Military Commission, recently came to Hong Kong on official business and was extremely indignant about the rumors and slanders spread by a certain tabloid in Shanghai about him and Tan Ying. Cheng said, "…I have been working hard for the country, braving danger on the front lines, sacrificing the happiness of my family, all to fulfill my personal responsibility to the country and the nation. Although I do not seek praise from friends, they instead fabricate stories to damage our relationship. In fact, our relationship cannot be destroyed by those rumors, but I always wonder why those who damage me don't use their pens to attack others? Instead, they slander someone who is working for the country."

It is now a fact that Jin Yan and Wang Renmei have accepted an invitation from the Central Film Studio to participate in the filming of "A Thousand Miles of Clear Sky." Jin and Wang left Hong Kong on October 23rd, transiting through Haiphong to Chongqing.

Li Dashen has arrived in Hong Kong with Zhu Qingxian. The cooperation between Xinhua and Nanyue has been materialized. First, they will film "Peerless Beauty" starring Hu Die. Following this film will be "The Oil Peddler Courts the Courtesan." It is not yet determined whether Hu Die will play the "Courtesan" in this film. It is said that at least ten films must be shot in the next year, all of which will be domestically produced. Actors will also be transferred from Shanghai to Hong Kong to work. The first batch of those heading south are Lu Luming, Tan Ying, Sun Min, and others.

The news that Hua Huilin will play "Empress Dowager Cixi" has been recorded in this publication. Hong Kong's Nanyang Company has now produced this film, directed by Gao Lihen and starring Li Qinian. However, after filming for only a few days, Gao suffered from hemoptysis due to overwork, and the filming was temporarily suspended. The "Empress Dowager Cixi" filmed by Nanyang is a Cantonese film, while the one Hua plans to film is a Mandarin film, which can be said to be completely unrelated.

Hu Die told people that her current weight is several pounds lighter than when she filmed "Rouge Tears" in the autumn, returning to her average figure. However, she still dares not eat too many nutritious foods.

The Friendship Company, jointly formed by Gu Wuwei and Qian Zao, has not yet officially released its first film "Flower of the Earth" except for a charity screening. The second film has been decided to start filming at the beginning of the month, with the title "The Wang Clan and Qin Hui." The Wang Clan will be played by Lu Cuilan, and Qin Hui may be played by Tang Huaiqiu as a guest role. Members of the China Travel Service's Hong Kong troupe will also participate in the performance.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

The Miraculous Reunion of Wang Yunfang and His Father

Wang Yunfang, an old partner of Kirin Tong, was appreciated by the opera-loving circles for his meticulous acting and generous demeanor when he performed on stages such as the Tianchan in Shanghai a few years ago. However, he was fond of Buddhism by nature. Besides writing and painting at home, he was very fond of studying Buddhism with others. Whenever he met with friends, he always held his rosary and chanted "Amitabha." If others talked to him about family matters, he would sigh deeply, expressing infinite sadness. Whenever it was the New Year or other festivals, when neighbors and fellow professionals shared the joy of family reunions, he was even more saddened, often saying to others, "I will never be able to get the true love of my parents in this life; I can only chant Buddha and cultivate for the next life!" Unexpectedly, when he was nearly thirty years old, an old man surnamed Wang sent him a letter, saying that he was his father, from whom he had been separated for twenty years. When Yunfang first received this letter, he suspected that it was an unscrupulous person impersonating him for fraud. However, after several correspondences and exchanging photos, it was finally proven to be his father, Bi Chang. At that time, Yunfang was overjoyed, thinking that it was his sincerity that moved him, and that the gods and Buddhas had secretly driven him, so he encouraged his father and son to leave their respective residences in Shandong Province and reunite in their ancestral home in Jiangsu Province (originally from Jintan, Jiangsu). In his surprise and joy, he specially hosted a banquet at the Daya Building on Fourth Avenue, inviting Mr. Bu Linwu, Xu Langxi, Su Shaoqing, Zen Master Huihai, and myself, among others. These people had either introduced him to perform in the south, or had a teacher-student relationship with him, and encouraged and taught him to promote his studies so that he could gain a foothold in Shanghai. At that time, his father, Bi Chang, also attended the banquet, but this person seemed to have a slight mental illness and did not say a word throughout the banquet. We were not convenient to inquire about the truth of this matter on the spot, but what can give us a superficial proof is that Mr. Bi Chang's face and figure are almost identical to Yunfang's, especially the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and nose. After he finished eating and left first, the crowd began to inquire Yunfang in detail about the course of this matter, and he had the following account. (132)

New Film Introduction

### Serenade

— Qi Hua

"They Shall Have Music"

"Serenade" mainly introduces the violin virtuoso Jascha Heifetz's performances, and The Peter Meremblum California Junior Symphony Orchestra. In the whole film, Jascha Heifetz's violin performance appears three times, and his fingering and bowing are solemnly introduced. During the first performance, the camera captures the use of his fingers and bowing from various angles. Therefore, for those who are interested in music and researchers, this specially filmed "Serenade" is worth seeing.

As for the story woven together, it tells of music professor Lawson taking in poor children as students, which leads to the school's financial difficulties and heavy debts. However, when he sees the students he personally trained succeed in art during the performance, his heartfelt joy is evident on his face. The success of an artist is achieved through much hardship and painstaking effort, which is very touching. However, in this "Serenade," which focuses on music, the director's skills are too weak, and it is far inferior when compared with "Danfeng Chaoyang," which has the same theme.

Joe McCreery and Andrea Leeds do not have much to do in the film. Walter Connolly, who plays Professor Lawson, performs very well in the style of a musician. For example, when he discovers that Frank understands musical notes, when his own band is playing a piece of music, and when he listens to a female student's piano solo at a concert, the expression of spiritual comfort is sincere and touching. The child who plays Frank is also very good at acting, but there are not enough opportunities for development here.
