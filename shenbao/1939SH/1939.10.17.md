Every student must resolutely fulfill his responsibility of saving the country against Japanese aggression and assist in the implementation of the Three Principles of the People so that China can achieve independence and freedom. Today, the troops at the front are sacrificing their lives to free China from brutal oppression. Therefore, every citizen must resolutely express the same spirit of sacrifice to avenge the nation's shame.

Editorial

### Review of Japan's Economic Strategy Towards China

The aggression of modern countries takes economics as the sole goal. However, Japan's aggression towards China simultaneously encompasses political, military, and economic objectives. Although economics was an important component in its initial consciousness, the irrational development of facts has transformed it into politics and military as the primary focus, with economics as secondary. This is no longer modern aggression, but a complete, primitive plunder. This can be distinguished not only by analyzing the nature of its policies, but also by verifying its accuracy with various small actions in the occupied areas of China. Of course, this is what Japan is unwilling to admit, but the problem lies in the form of facts, not in willingness or unwillingness. Even if Japan does not recognize aggression at all, even economic aggression, it only needs new factual forms in the future to provide counter-evidence, without waiting for Japan's denial.

Japan unconsciously placed excessive emphasis on politics and the military. Political conspiracies and military offensives have not succeeded, and its economic strategies have also failed. The so-called political conspiracy is based on the tone of "using Chinese to control Chinese." The so-called military offensive takes quick battles and quick decisions as the strategy. The so-called economic strategy is not the looting of small actions, but the establishment of the "North China Development Corporation" and the "Central China Revitalization Corporation." (In South China, operations are temporarily entrusted to the "Taiwan Colonization Corporation," which is small in scale and will not be discussed here.)

The North China and Central China companies were "formally established" on November 7 last year, with the same mission as the "South Manchuria Railway Company" in the four eastern provinces, that is, what the Japanese call "national policy companies." The former has a capital of 350 million Japanese yen: the business plan is divided into (1) transportation and ports (2) postal and telecommunications (3) power generation (4) minerals (5) salt manufacturing, sales and utilization, etc. The latter has a capital of 100 million Japanese yen: the business plan is divided into (1) railways (2) water transport (3) communications (4) radio broadcasting (5) electricity and tap water (6) minerals (7) Shanghai public utilities (8) aquatic products, etc. (As for the cotton planting industry, which is the main resource in North China, it is controlled by another "North China Cotton Company.") Judging from the business plans of the two companies, it seems that everything is included, and the resources of North and Central China can be grasped at once. Unfortunately, the fact is quite different.

Facts led to his failure: First, the military occupation area is not only temporarily occupied in international law, but it is not that the area can be occupied as one's own property when the force is reached; and in various objective conditions, only points and lines are occupied, and the "surface" cannot be occupied stably. As evidence of the repeated cutting of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, it can be seen that the so-called line is by no means stable; furthermore, as evidence that Hunan, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Hubei, and other provinces, once counterattacked by the Chinese army, have recovered several rivers, mountains, towns, and cities, it can also be seen that the so-called point is by no means stable. Japan placed excessive emphasis on the military, and the points and lines occupied by the military could not be grasped, so how could the economic strategy attached to the military be implemented?

Second, in China, economic facilities require the cooperation of the Chinese people as a factual necessity. In the military-occupied areas, Japan's power is enough to deter the Chinese in the occupied areas who have no weapons and no money. However, in the past two years, Japan's massacres and small actions, not to mention the sadness, anger, resentment, and poison of the Chinese in the occupied areas, are at least respected and kept at a distance. How can we achieve the so-called cooperation? The puppets who follow the Japanese, regardless of their consciousness, ability, or even "status," are fundamentally unworthy to be one party in the cooperation between the two parties. Furthermore, imagining the Japanese side's idea, they will never regard the Chinese in the occupied areas as friends who can confide in each other and conspire to achieve mutual benefit; they treat each other like masters and servants, and defend against each other like thieves. How can they invest? How to establish economic relations? How can they promote their economic strategy?

Third, the Japanese side has no way. The capital of the North China and Central China companies is said to be 350 million yen and 100 million yen respectively; at first glance, it seems that it is not too little, but it is actually very weak to undertake the various projects in its plan. And in fact, the capital contributed by the Japanese government, except for the so-called "in-kind shares," is extremely small: most of it is waiting for Japanese private investment, but private investors are neither reassured nor interested in this investment. (The North China Company's private shares are divided into 3.5 million shares, and only 100,000 shares are publicly raised. The Central China Company's private shares are divided into 100,000 shares, but there are 9,770 shareholders!) The results are so miserable that it has to adopt the method of issuing company debentures; who knows who will buy the bonds? Everything is hitting a wall, so after discussions between the Tokyo government and various related parties, it is believed that the Japanese government has no way to assist North China, Central China, and the "Manchuria Five-Year Development Plan." As a result, its planned policy had to be changed. The board of directors of the North China Company met in Beiping and decided to amend the organizational law, and in the future, all facilities should be limited to satisfying local needs, and no longer based on the plan preset by Tokyo. In other words, in the future, the Tokyo side will only take a hands-off attitude towards economic development plans in mainland China, and all projects must be supported by the two companies themselves; if Tokyo's assistance is necessary, it will be limited to those that directly generate profits that can be compensated. Facts have proved that Japan's economic strategy towards China under aggression has failed! Gold and stone calligraphy and painting, mahogany tables and chairs, although they have been effectively carried back full of small actions; this can be said to be quite successful in primitive looting; but in modern economic aggression, it is not as valuable.

### British and French Allied Forces Stand Ready to Defend Against German Attack; French Artillery Bombards German Concentration Points; Large Numbers of German Troops Head to the Front Lines Overnight

Paris: Anticipating a large-scale German attack on the British and French Allied Forces within the week, it is reported that the British and French Allied Forces have completed their preparations to meet the enemy. It is rumored that Hitler's headquarters have moved to the western front today. It is expected that the German side will use large numbers of tanks, bombers, and fighter jets as its main force in the offensive. According to observers here, if the German side attacks, it will inevitably be on the Saar front, while the Rhine front, where the river is very rapid, and the main railway bridges have been bombed and destroyed by the French army, making it very difficult for the German side to advance. As for the front east of Luxembourg, the mountainous terrain is rugged and the forests are dense, making it even more difficult for the tanks that Hitler relies on as his weapons to be used. The western front was cloudy and foggy on Sunday, with not much activity. (16th Reuters Dispatch)

Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 84, stating, "There are frequent movements in the enemy's positions between the Moselle and Saar Rivers. Patrols of both enemy and our forces are active near the city of Weissenburg." (16th Havas Dispatch)

Paris: German troops have been concentrating along the Moselle River and in the Hardt Forest for days, appearing ready for a large-scale offensive. French artillery has been shelling the enemy's concentration points and rear areas along the entire 100-kilometer front since late last night, with great force. Yesterday, the front was very quiet, and the German artillery was also silent. This is no different from the situation before the previous attacks. The French headquarters sent out reconnaissance teams to scout around and ambushed at the end of the Hardt Forest, often capturing several enemy soldiers. In the evening, French army and air force observers discovered that the enemy's rear was extremely active, and transportation on the roads leading to the front was also very frequent. Listening quietly with sound detection machines from the French positions, the sound was clear and distinguishable. The French authorities then took preemptive action and bombarded it with fierce artillery fire. (16th Havas Dispatch)

Paris: According to reports from French observation posts and front-line guards, the German front and rear were unusually active last night. The ten-mile road from the front to the rear was illuminated by searchlights, indicating that road transportation was very busy. Cars used their headlights to give light to advancing troops or vehicles without lights. Torches flashed all night along the front lines, indicating that troops were arriving and being distributed to various positions, and officers were examining maps to find the assigned defensive points. The sound of engines was very loud in various rear areas, indicating that heavy tanks and heavy trucks were densely moving forward. According to custom, troops are transferred to the front-line positions 24 hours before they intend to take the offensive, so there seems to be no doubt that the German army will take the offensive, or it can be said that it has already begun. (16th Reuters Dispatch)

London: Although the German National Socialists are unwilling to tell the truth to the residents of the Rhineland, the people of the Rhineland have been greatly shaken by the French army pressing on the border. It is rumored that more than two million residents have been evacuated, which is truly an experience that the Germans have not had in more than a hundred years. The French army's occupation of German territory also has a huge economic impact. The French air force and artillery have caused various industries in the Saar region to come to a standstill, and Germany has not been able to obtain a large amount of coal and iron from this area. According to observers in London, German propaganda often says that the progress of the French army on the western front is minimal, and towns such as Saarbrücken, within two miles of the border, are still in German hands. The Siegfried Line is also far from the front line, and this line is intact except for being shelled. Germany obviously wants the British and French Allied forces to make a frontal attack and suffer many casualties. However, in the initial stage of the current war situation, it is not important for the army to go deep. The British and French Allied forces have learned from the bitter experience of the European war, and are currently fighting steadily and steadily, making a systematic encirclement. This tactic has achieved very valuable results at a very small price. Saarbrücken is an important intersection of roads and railways, and is now surrounded on three sides by the French army. All roads and railways are within the range of French artillery fire stably positioned on the high ground. The French army is not eagerly occupying this town, because the occupation of this town may not increase the French army's advantage, but only make the army ambushed or hand-to-hand combat, resulting in unnecessary casualties. (16th Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military headquarters announced that once the German army has completely occupied all areas within the scope of German interests in the former Polish territory, the German military headquarters will stop publishing reports on the eastern front. As for the western front, there is only a small-scale war with little artillery fire. On the Rhine River, the French army, which has built strong fortresses southwest of Stahstad, has been forced to withdraw due to rising river water. (16th Haitong Dispatch)

British naval officials have denied this claim. This, along with the German claim that the British battleship HMS Hood was sunk last night, is also fabricated. (Havas, 16th)

London – The French mail steamer "Brazza" (10,000 tons) and the steamer "Louisiane" (7,000 tons) were sunk by German submarines on the 14th of this month in the Atlantic Ocean. British warships immediately sailed to rescue the passengers and crew, totaling 400 people, including many women and children. Only fifteen people are missing. Survivors who landed in a British port this afternoon said that the "Louisiane" was intercepted by a German submarine that demanded supplies. The captain refused, and the submarine opened fire, killing the first mate. Several women and children were also injured. Seven passengers on the "Brazza" died, and many lifeboats were damaged by gunfire and rendered unusable. Many passengers had to swim in the water until rescued by British warships after swimming for over an hour and a half. (Havas, 15th)

Passengers and crew floated on small boats for over eight hours before being rescued by a British warship. They arrived safely in the country today. The "Arvondale," displacing 9,205 tons, was completed just last year and was well-equipped. (Havas, 15th)

Amsterdam – According to news received here, the British 9,200-ton ship "North Haven" was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean yesterday. All passengers and sailors were rescued by British warships. (Haitong, 16th)

London – Germany has repeatedly issued news claiming that a British 10,000-ton cruiser was sunk off the southwest coast of Scotland. In addition, two British aircraft carriers were sunk one after another, and a destroyer and the battleship HMS Hood were severely damaged and will be out of service for several months. Several cruisers and destroyers were either sunk or damaged during the battle off the coast of Norway last week. British officials have corrected this information, stating that the so-called 10,000-ton cruiser was merely an ordinary patrol vessel, which was damaged but not sunk. The battleship HMS Hood was never hit. Of the aircraft carriers, only the HMS Courageous was sunk; the HMS Ark Royal was hit by water. The naval attaché of the U.S. Embassy in England boarded the HMS Ark Royal a few days after Germany broadcast this news, proving that the claims were completely inaccurate. In short, no British destroyers or cruisers have been hit since the outbreak of the war. Although German aircraft bombed the Norwegian coast for a long time during the battle, none of the bombs hit their targets. (Havas, 15th)

### German Aircraft Attack Scottish Coast; British Fighter Planes Respond

Royal Air Force planes immediately intercepted and inflicted casualties. Details of the engagement are still being investigated. However, according to news from Edinburgh, fragments of shells were found on several streets in the city after the anti-aircraft fire ceased. Someone standing in front of his shop picked up a piece a few yards away, still feeling hot. The air raid siren did not sound. There was also a lot of aerial activity in the northern part of Edinburgh. According to eyewitnesses, three fighter planes were seen flying low in the sky. Subsequently, an enemy aircraft flew low towards the city, disappearing behind a hill. Soon after, the sound of machine guns roared, and the aircraft turned northeast.

According to reports from Edinburgh, three German aircraft were seen flying over the Firth of Forth. (Reuters, 16th)

It is anticipated that important decisions will be made to promote mutual interests between the countries. The King of Denmark is scheduled to depart from here tomorrow evening with the Foreign Minister to attend the conference in Stockholm. (Haitong, 16th)

Stockholm, Sweden – Today, Swedish newspapers published the names of the personnel who will accompany the heads of state of the Nordic countries to Stockholm, but the name of a director from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not included, drawing attention here. It is generally believed that Finland's Director Niko Poes, currently staying in Moscow with Paasikivi, will also attend. It is reported that the heads of state of the Nordic countries will arrive here on the 18th and begin the meeting at the Royal Palace on the same day. A grand banquet will be held that evening, inviting all attendees. (Haitong, 16th)

Brussels – Belgian public opinion advocates that Belgium and the Netherlands should act in unison with the four Nordic countries at the Stockholm Conference. Political circles here believe that close cooperation among neutral countries is essential. Belgian newspapers state the historical mission of the Nordic countries, hoping that the Stockholm Conference will take steps to stop the "terrible catastrophe." "L'Indépendance Belge" believes that only the heads of state of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland formally proposing a peace appeal can persuade President Roosevelt to take new steps to mediate the current European war. (Haitong, 16th)

### Finland Temporarily Refrains from Announcing Soviet Demands, Hope Remains for an Agreement

Helsinki, Finland – The Finnish delegation, led by Minister to Sweden Paasikivi, returned from Moscow on the 14th of this month and is expected to return home tomorrow to submit a report to the government. They are scheduled to return to Moscow on the 17th to continue negotiations. Regarding the nature of the demands made by the Soviet Union, officials here are remaining silent. Political circles say that the fact that Paasikivi was allowed to return home to report suggests that the demands are not of an ultimatum nature, and that there is hope for a friendly resolution of the talks between Finland and the Soviet Union. However, the Finnish government is still taking various security measures for precautionary reasons and continuing to conscript reserves into service. (Havas, 15th)

Helsinki – The Finnish government and the Finnish Presidential Palace refuse to disclose details of the demands made by the Soviet Union to Finland, but claim that the news published in overseas newspapers regarding these demands is completely untrue. According to information obtained from reliable sources by a Moscow correspondent for a Danish newspaper, the Soviet Union has made four demands on Finland, three of which are: (1) Cession of the islands of Tytärsaari, Lavansaari, and Säiskari in the Gulf of Finland, and control of the island of Sursaari, which controls Kronshtadt Bay, may also be included in the cession. (2) Finland must not fortify the Åland Islands and must allow the Soviet Union the right to inspect the islands. (3) Finland must conclude a military treaty with the Soviet Union. The fourth demand is unknown, but it is believed that this is the reason why the Finnish delegation returned home. The Soviet Union agreed to cede territory in East Karelia to compensate for the cession of the islands in the first demand. It is reported that representatives of the Finnish National Socialist Party recently went to Berlin but returned empty-handed because the delegation was only received by low-level officials who told them that Finland's interests were not within Germany's sphere of influence. (Reuters, 16th)

Helsinki – According to news received here today, Finland will actively participate in the four-nation conference convened by the Nordic countries in Stockholm. At the same time, methods to protect civilians and property are being vigorously promoted. Thousands of high-speed trains, trucks, and horse-drawn carriages are being prepared for contingencies. Food reserves are also plentiful, but the people are being urged not to waste water. Tourists and ships are no longer allowed to travel to the Åland Islands, and travel between Finland and Sweden has also been restricted. (Associated Press, 16th)

Copenhagen – According to a Helsinki correspondent for a Danish newspaper, Finland is still continuing to prepare for contingencies. All valuables in Helsinki are being moved elsewhere, and shops are also transporting all their inventory to the countryside. It is expected that Finland will soon have an army of 500,000 men. According to rumors in Helsinki, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was in Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov told him that the German residents of Finland must be evacuated completely. It is reported that Ribbentrop has agreed. (Reuters, 16th)

Zurich, Switzerland – According to news from Moscow, Soviet authorities are busy preparing for the elections to the National Assembly of the Ukrainian region of Poland. The region is divided into 1,500 electoral districts.

In addition, a certain newspaper reported that the Soviet government intended to sovietize the Baltic Sea coastal countries. Soviet newspapers have firmly denied this. (Havas, 15th)

Zurich, Switzerland – The Neue Zürcher Zeitung recently reported that each Soviet army unit entering Polish territory is a propaganda unit. They carry large amounts of communist propaganda materials to distribute to residents, and propaganda agencies and printing presses have been set up everywhere to spread the ideology in various languages and pictures to residents of cities and towns and villagers in rural areas, house by house. The names of those who refuse to accept portraits of Stalin and other propaganda materials are registered. The propagandists also encourage farmers to seize the land of landlords and take it for themselves. (Havas, 15th)

### Molotov Receives the Turkish Foreign Minister. The Signing of the Soviet-Turkish Agreement is Postponed Due to New Demands from the Soviet Union

Berlin - The German News Agency released a special dispatch from Moscow stating that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu at the Kremlin this afternoon. Prior to this meeting, Soviet-Turkish negotiations had resumed. (Reuters, 16th)

London - According to a dispatch from the Istanbul correspondent of the News Chronicle today, the reason for the breakdown of Soviet-Turkish negotiations is that the Soviet Union is demanding that Turkey terminate its mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is now awaiting new instructions from the Turkish government. (Associated Press, 16th)

Rome - According to informed sources, the Soviet Union intends to provide guarantees for the Romanian border in exchange for Romania's recognition of Soviet interests in the Balkans. It is also said that in view of the compromise already reached between Turkey and Romania, the two countries may request the Soviet Union to provide full guarantees for the Turkish-Romanian border as compensation for blocking the Dardanelles Strait. (Reuters, 16th)

Danzig - According to the Berlin correspondent of the National Daily here, the new demands made by the Soviet Union to Turkey have made the nearly concluded Soviet-Turkish talks in Moscow difficult.

Ankara - Regarding the negotiations between Turkey and the Soviet Union, the cabinet convened a State Council meeting last night to discuss the matter until late at night. Officials are unwilling to express anything about the details of the meeting. The semi-official Ulus newspaper also made no mention of it. (Havas, 16th)

London - Political figures here have recently commented on the negotiations between Turkey and the Soviet Union, saying that the reports that the two countries would sign an agreement at the end of last week have not materialized, indicating that the current negotiations must have encountered difficulties. Although German sources have reported that the conditions put forward by the Soviet Union have been rejected by Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu and that the negotiations have almost broken down, there is no evidence to prove this. The claim that the Soviet Union is demanding the abolition of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey is also not necessarily reliable. It is believed that the difficulty in the negotiations lies in the issue of the invasion of Romania or Greece, as Turkey has an obligation to assist these countries. As for the current negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland, according to what is known here, the Soviet Union has indeed demanded several small islands in the Gulf of Finland and has demanded that Finland agree not to build defensive fortifications on the Åland Islands, allowing the Soviet Union to monitor them. At the same time, it also signed military clauses with the Soviet Union. Although all these matters have caused difficulties, there is still a possibility of reaching an understanding. (Havas, 16th)

### The Soviet Red Star Newspaper Comments on the Positions of Britain and France

Moscow - The Red Star newspaper recently published an article titled "Chamberlain's Warmongering," stating, "Chamberlain and Daladier recently delivered speeches in response to Hitler's proposal to convene a conference of major powers to peacefully resolve the dispute, declaring that Britain and France will continue to fight. The positions of these two prime ministers have completely exposed the true imperialist aims of the Allied forces to the public. Britain and France have rejected Germany's peace proposals and must bear full responsibility for the continuation of the war and the endless disasters that will follow. The rapid development of the situation in recent days has made the working masses increasingly aware of the truth. No matter how hard the Labour Party tries, it cannot conceal the following fact: the purpose of launching and continuing this war is purely to intensify the exploitation of the laboring masses by capitalist aggressors. The anti-war movement is growing in Britain, and various workers' organizations have recently passed numerous resolutions demanding an immediate return to peace." (TASS, 15th)

### The Peace Movement Continues, with the Pope and the King of Belgium Both Expected to Make Statements

Brussels - King Leopold III of Belgium, at the request of U.S. President Roosevelt, is scheduled to deliver a radio address on the 26th of this month, which will be broadcast across the United States by the New York Broadcasting Station. The 20th Century newspaper here commented on this matter, saying, "The American intellectual community launched an initiative last year, inviting celebrities from around the world to deliver radio addresses. The first person to do so was Mrs. Roosevelt. Now, Leopold III will address international affairs and neutrality, expressing Belgium's views on the issue of neutrality. This move is of great significance in the current situation." (Havas, 16th)

Milan - Pope Pius XII is currently preparing to issue his first encyclical.

If not affected by unexpected political developments, the encyclical is expected to be published around the end of the month. (Haitong, 16th)

New York - Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George published another article in the New York American today, discussing the issue of war and peace in Europe. He said that if U.S. President Roosevelt could come forward to convene a peace conference, then this conference would definitely succeed. The hesitation of the current belligerent countries to launch large-scale warfare is a great opportunity for mediating peace. If "three courageous countries" cannot avoid large-scale military confrontation, then in addition to the terror of bloodshed and sacrifice, the consequences are unpredictable. (Haitong, 16th)

### Germany Plans to Use Submarines and Aircraft to Attack Britain's Maritime Control

### Germany Plans to Exchange "Colonial" Rights for Soviet Gold: Reason for the Withdrawal of Germans from the Baltic Coast

Riga - According to information obtained here, Germany and the Soviet Union have recently agreed on a plan that is very beneficial to the Soviet Union. The main point is that Germany will exchange its "colonial rights" in Europe for Soviet gold. Germany needs gold very urgently, and the Soviet Union will only agree to provide gold after Germany relinquishes its rights in the Baltic Sea region. Hitler was forced to decide to withdraw the Germans from the Baltic states. After all these people have been evacuated, the Soviet Union will have to pay the first batch of gold. The property left behind by these Germans will be received by the government of the country where they are located and paid to Germany in gold, and then the government will pay it to the Germans in Marks, as compensation. (Havas, 16th)

Danzig - The Swedish correspondent of the National Daily here reported that the evacuation of Germans from the Baltic states is the greatest tragedy in German history. They have lost everything without suffering any blows. The evacuating German residents are only allowed to take one bicycle, five Marks, and a day's worth of food. As for all their furniture, it must be sealed up. Money is deposited in the bank, and it is unknown whether it will be returned to its original owner in the future. All German businesses have been placed under local management. German banks have closed. The German newspaper in Riga will cease publication on November 10th. In Riga alone, 35,000 Germans have left the country, and their future is uncertain. They do not know where they will go. (Reuters, 16th)

### Personnel Changes in the U.S. Navy

London - According to a dispatch from the New York correspondent of the Daily Mail, after major defects were discovered in the design and construction of some new U.S. ships, major changes have occurred in the U.S. Navy, resulting in the transfer of three admirals and the reassignment of many junior officers. Rear Admiral Bowen, the former head of the Bureau of Engineering, has been transferred to be the head of the Naval Research Laboratory in Bellevue. Rear Admiral Dubois, the head of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, has been transferred to be the director of the new model ship canal in Carderock. His former position will be succeeded by Rear Admiral Kling, the head of the Washington Navy Yard. The correspondent also stated that the stability of two newly built 1,600-ton destroyers is questionable because their weight has exceeded several tons and they lack operational efficiency. In addition, there are ten similar destroyers that could have joined the fleet soon, but currently, urgent changes will need to be made to the construction of each ship. (Reuters News Agency, 16th)

### U.S. Neutrality Act Amendment Will Be Amended Again to Remove Restrictions on Pacific Navigation

Washington - According to sources here last night, Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a secret meeting to further amend the Neutrality Act Amendment to remove restrictions on Pacific navigation for American merchant ships. Except for the European war zone, the President will be given the power to designate other prohibited areas so that American merchants can continue to trade with nominal belligerents, such as New Zealand and the South African Federation. The administration believes that this amendment can be passed in the Senate because there are now several senators from Pacific coastal states who are participants in isolationist debates and who all feel this way. It is understood that Majority Leader Barkley will propose to start one hour earlier each day and delay adjournment by several hours. Unless the isolationists can agree to limit the debate, Barkley predicts that the Neutrality Act Amendment will be put to a vote by the end of next week. At the same time, the isolationists are also preparing for a final push. Johnson and Holt will speak tomorrow and Wednesday, respectively. They will attack the government, saying that the government had promised Britain and France that the United States could amend the Neutrality Act if Britain and France fought Hitler. (Associated Press, 16th)

### A Chinese Aircraft Manufacturing Plant Has Been Established in the Southwest, with 2,500 Technicians and Modern Equipment

New York - China now has an aircraft manufacturing plant worth US$2 million, employing 2,500 Chinese technicians supervised and trained by 15 American technicians. The plant is located in a remote town in the interior of China with a population of 3,500. All equipment is modern. The plant was designed in 1933, and new products were launched the following year. To avoid Japanese aircraft attacks, the plant has been relocated four times. The current location is named Paulville (named after Paul, the chairman of the Continental Corporation). The place has become a town. The town's base was selected on December 10th last year and resumed production of new aircraft in May of this year. Paul has been involved in the export of aircraft and raw materials for many years. He began his relationship with the Chinese Air Force in 1933. He sold a private aircraft to China and helped China reorganize its air force. Later, he developed a friendship with senior Chinese officials and sold Curtis aircraft worth US$1 million to the Chinese government. Soon, he became China's informal aircraft supplier. The Chinese government and he planned to establish China's first aircraft manufacturing plant. In the summer of 1934, the aircraft factory started manufacturing, but it was bombed within three days of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and immediately moved to another location. The Chinese government supplied trucks to transport the machinery to Nanjing, and then by ferry to Hankou. Amid constant Japanese air raids, it took five days of arduous work to reach the destination. When the Chinese army withdrew from Hankou, the Chinese government and Paul once again moved the factory, with a total of 181 trucks, traveling more than a thousand miles without any loss along the way. The new factory is located in southwest China, with only a narrow-gauge railroad from French Indochina to reach the location. The location is very hidden, but transportation is extremely inconvenient. So, it was moved again. With the cooperation of all parties and the use of a large number of Chinese workers, the personnel of this Sino-American cooperative aircraft factory, including architects from Myanmar and China, worked hard for a long time to complete this new factory. All equipment is state-of-the-art and comparable to any American factory. There are 3,500 residents in this new factory city, with all modern facilities, including a club for foreigners and 21 villas. The hospital has 81 beds and cost a total of 700,000 yuan. This kind of construction would cost at least 2.5 million yuan in the United States. Paul resides in Hong Kong and has traveled to the interior 27 times in the last eight months, all by plane. However, Paul is currently in New York. (Associated Press, 16th)

### Chen Mingshu Has Not Left Chongqing

Chongqing - The Japanese broadcast on the 9th of this month that Chen Mingshu had left Chongqing for Hong Kong. According to Xie Renzhao, the person in charge of the National Diplomacy Association, the Japanese have spread rumors about Chen Mingshu's actions more than once. This kind of divisive trick is not worth laughing at. Mr. Chen is the chairman of this association, and I am most familiar with his actions. I will not elaborate on other matters. Taking the Wang Lixi Memorial Service on the 8th of this month as an example, Mr. Chen personally attended the meeting and served as the chairman, which proves that the Japanese rumors are futile.

### Kong Xiangxi Issues a Statement: Japan Intends to Subjugate the United States, and the United States Cannot Ignore It

Chongqing - Today, a reporter asked Dr. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan of China, whether China has any intention of seeking peace with Japan. Kong replied, "Today's question is not about China seeking peace with Japan, but about whether Japan can abandon its aggression against China. All countries in the world know that China is a peace-loving country. We only know how to fight for national survival and to maintain a peaceful order, until Japan abandons its ambition to conquer and control China, peace can be realized. Furthermore, peace must be based on honor and justice and must be a lasting peace. The peace between China and Japan is not only related to China and Japan but also to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. Furthermore, Japan's aggressive aim is not only to conquer China but also to subjugate the United States. At present, it is certainly a difficult goal to make Japan conquer the United States, but if Japan can control China's manpower and resources, its plan will be greatly expanded. Therefore, the United States cannot ignore the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, we cannot help but hope for direct American assistance and spiritual sympathy. However, if the United States wants to restore peace in the Far East and maintain its interests in the Far East, it does not need to resort to force. The United States only needs to adopt an attitude of using force to maintain its interests to achieve its goal. But if the Japanese know that the Americans are not prepared to defend their main interests in the East with force, then Japan will actively carry out its plan to destroy these interests. If Japan's position in the East becomes stronger and more solid, then Japan will attack the United States itself. Fifteen years ago, some people thought it was a joke that Japan would never attack China, but now it is a fact. Today, some people think that Japan will never attack the United States. Who knows if they will fall into a lack of awareness again? The most obvious thing is that if Japan does not want to attack other countries besides China, then why did Japan abolish the Washington Naval Treaty? Why build a powerful navy? It must be known that Japan's military operations against China are mainly based on the army and air force and do not need to use the main force of the navy. Furthermore, if Japan has no ambition towards the United States, then why has Japan established a spy network in the United States, Panama, and other parts of the Americas? And the discovery of these spies is mostly due to the American government. If Japan has no ambition towards the United States, then why do Japan's large fishing fleets gather on the American Pacific coast and enter and exit the Hawaiian Islands? If we search for the motives and answers to these questions one by one, we will have thought about half of them. In short, Japan not only harbors the ambition to dominate the world, but also resents the United States because of the American immigration law that excludes Japanese people, the California legislature that does not allow Japanese people to purchase land, and other treatments that the Japanese regard as humiliating. Your President has advocated resolving the dispute between China and Japan and restoring peace in the Far East through an international conference, which shows that your country's politicians have excellent insights into restoring peace in the Far East. The United States will certainly not sign a new treaty with Japan until Japan expresses its respect for the rights of third countries. But since Japan is trying to subjugate China and eliminate the power of Western countries in China, it is certainly impossible for it to respect the rights of third countries. And Japan's attempt to eliminate Western power in China is not an empty theory but a fact. Recently, Japan has demanded that Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in China, which is one example. As for Japan's spending all its resources to buy scrap iron from the United States, it is nothing more than wanting to use it to conquer the world. Therefore, China's current resistance is fighting for the world, and it is fighting for the United States, Japan's neighbor across the Pacific. Therefore, my current appeal to the United States is not for American sympathy (because we have fully appreciated and are grateful for American sympathy), but for American cooperation so that this international rogue will not act recklessly." (Maris, Far East Manager of the Associated Press, 26th)

### Fierce Battles in the Suburbs of Chaozhou City: Chinese Troops Brave Rain to Capture Bijia Mountain; Traitorous Chao'an Rely on Opium and Gambling for a Living

Shantou Correspondence: For days, the Chinese guerilla forces have been entering and exiting Chenghai City, their footprints reaching deep into Ouding and even outside Shantou City. The Japanese troops have divided their forces to harass Raoping's Lin and Chaoyang's Haimen Shalung, attempting to contain the outer lines of the Chinese army. The Chaoshan Railway and the levee highway have been cut off by the Chinese army in multiple sections, effectively encircling Chao'an City on three sides, preventing Japanese reinforcements from Shantou. Simultaneously, the Chinese army is heavily deployed in areas like Anjie Road, and Sangpu, Yixi, and Zhutong Mountain, with guerillas providing cover for artillery positions on various high grounds outside the city. On the morning of the 3rd, amidst heavy rain, Commander Tan's troops, crossing the Han River upstream, braved the rain to charge and seize the Japanese positions on Bijia Mountain. Upon reaching the mountainside, Japanese artillery on the summit opened fire, but to no effect. A bayonet charge ensued for an hour, culminating in the Chinese troops capturing the Japanese artillery positions and seizing twelve cannons. A post-battle inspection of the mountain revealed over 130 Japanese corpses left behind, with many more wounded escaping. The Japanese suffered approximately 200 casualties in this battle. On the 5th, under clear skies, Chinese aircraft appeared over Chaoshan at 7 AM, dropping bombs on the Yixi area north of the city, preventing Japanese forces from massing. The Chinese ××× Group Army, having reorganized in Fengshun and Jieyang, advanced to the outskirts of the city. Their new artillery accurately fired, engaging in artillery duels with the Japanese artillery on Hulu Mountain. From 8 AM, cannon fire resounded every minute, shaking the mountains. The area outside the city was deserted for dozens of miles, as villagers had received leaflets dropped by aircraft beforehand, warning them of the impending Chinese offensive, and voluntarily evacuated beyond the range of the artillery fire. The artillery battle continued until 10 AM when two Japanese planes arrived, circling the Han River levee multiple times for reconnaissance before dropping four bombs on the mountainous area near Yixi Station. However, the Chinese artillery positions were well-concealed and remained undetected. After the Japanese planes left, the Chinese artillery resumed firing, destroying almost all Japanese positions on Hulu Mountain and Jin Mountain. Two shells hit the Japanese barracks within the Han Mountain Normal School, causing thirty to forty Japanese casualties. The Chinese army did not hold Bijia Mountain after capturing it because the summit was exposed and offered no cover, making it vulnerable to aerial bombardment. The Japanese, on the other hand, would defend it at all costs, aiming to use it as a shield for the eastern part of Chaozhou City.

Due to the Fierce Fighting in Chao'an and Shantou, the Local Puppet Organizations have been Unable to Officially Appear for Three Months Since the End of June; However, Self-Serving Individuals, Frightened by the Cannon Fire, Dare Not Take Office; Individuals such as Chen Juemin, the puppet Hui Chao Jia Garrison Commander, Zhang Weichen, of the puppet Chaozhou Security Maintenance Association, and Zhou Zhizhen of the Shantou Local Security Committee, merely possess a wooden signboard and obtain some expenses from the Japanese army. In reality, they have no influence or function. Zheng Yunxiang, a Taiwanese resident of Chao'an for many years, ostensibly operates a pharmacy but is primarily engaged in smuggling. Recently, he enticed certain youth elements to hold a so-called Revival Assembly. On the 7th, the puppet Revival Association produced a puppet Chao'an Maintenance Committee, selecting Yu Xurunshi, Wu Peiyu, Hong Runbo, Fang Guoxing, and Lu Zhenzhi as puppet committee members. Amidst the cannon fire, they recruited fifty local thugs as puppet police, who are dedicated to collecting fees from gambling dens and brothels. Each evening, the committee members divide the proceeds, each receiving twenty to thirty yuan per day. However, upon hearing of guerilla forces entering the city, they all scatter and flee. After things settle down, they reappear to collect fees. Besides this, they have nothing to do. The puppet self-governance associations in various villages are similar. When twenty to thirty Japanese soldiers arrive in a village, the puppet committee members emerge from the opium dens to express their welcome. Flanking the soldiers with shiny bayonets, they strut around, declaring that the Imperial Army has arrived and demanding that everyone quickly pay the owed household taxes. They also demand that opium dens and gambling houses pay their back taxes and donate twenty yuan each to the Japanese army as a reward. They also ask the heads of various family clans for pigs, chickens, and ducks to buy wine and cook meals for the Japanese soldiers, keeping themselves busy with flattery. Their behavior is extremely despicable.

Japanese in Suzhou Establish a Materials Exchange

Compiling a List of Import and Export Goods

Suzhou Correspondence: This county, being the first city on the Beijing-Shanghai line, enjoys smooth water and land transportation and abundant resources. Although it suffered from the Japanese invasion, the losses were lighter compared to other counties. Consequently, the post-invasion cityscape appears bustling. Goods from neighboring counties are imported and exported, and due to transportation reasons, many are transshipped through this county, turning it into a commercial hub for the guerrilla areas south of the Yangtze River. The puppet county magistrate, driven by greed, re-established former checkpoints as merchandise inspection offices, levying heavy taxes. It is said that the monthly revenue is quite substantial, but it has also attracted the attention of the Japanese. They entrusted Lu 　 Bian (former Deputy Consul stationed in Keijo, Korea), a local resident, to establish a "Materials Exchange." The site has been determined to be a certain building on Guanqian Street in the city. It is reported that its business scope is very broad, controlling and monopolizing daily necessities such as rice, tea, silk, cloth, and cigarettes. In the future, the commercial interests of this county will be seized by this exchange, allowing it to raise prices at will. Although various shops have repeatedly requested the Japanese to prohibit this, they have been unsuccessful and can only lament their helplessness.

Furthermore, copper coins and fractional currency in this city were not lacking until two months ago. However, after the Japanese began purchasing them, they are now disappearing. Although the puppet police have repeatedly cracked down on the illegal sale of copper, they have been unable to stop it due to their limited authority. Currently, substitute currency notes are overflowing everywhere. Even very small shops are issuing large amounts of currency notes before the shopkeepers close down and flee. Petty criminals are using the names of old shops to print fake currency notes, creating chaos in the market, which is beyond imagination. It is rumored that the puppet Suzhou People's Bank (established by puppet Shanghai mayor Fu Zongyao and others) is taking advantage of this opportunity to print large numbers of fake fractional currency notes in order to absorb legal tender from the people.

Local Bullies Rampant in Dinghai

Two Teachers Murdered; County Government Sends Troops to Suppress Bandits

Dinghai Correspondence: Since the fall of this county, local bullies and vagrants have frequently taken the opportunity to rob in the countryside, falsely claiming to be guerrillas and forcibly collecting military supplies, causing great suffering to the people. Recently, some local bullies, again impersonating guerrillas, kidnapped Yu Zefang, the former headmaster of Gan Da Zhao Elementary School from Yixing, and Mei Xin, the former headmaster of Wu Xie Xin Family Temple Elementary School. They were shot dead in a certain village. County Magistrate Su was very saddened and indignant upon hearing the news. He immediately led his subordinates to a certain village to encircle and suppress the bandits, capturing the bandit leader's wife and several bandits. However, the bandit leader himself had disguised himself as a bride, escaped in a sedan chair to another location.

### Discussion on Cultivating Scout Instructors (Part 1) Yang Kejing

Detailed Explanation of the Necessity of Cultivating Scout Instructors

(Chongqing Dispatch) Yang Kejing, head of the organization section of the General Association of Boy Scouts of China, wrote an article on the cultivation of Scout instructors due to the extreme lack of Scout instructors in our country. The article offers concrete suggestions on how to cultivate a large number of Scout instructors in the future and is worth considering. The original text is recorded below.

Since the Ministry of Education issued an order requiring all junior high schools across the country to implement Scout training, most of the provinces and cities that had not yet organized Scouts have followed the order and set up Scouts. Although there is no clear order from all primary and secondary schools to uniformly implement Cub Scout training, many have voluntarily set up Cub Scouts or Scouts. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 25th year, there are a total of 3,2　 schools in the country, including 36 high schools, 191 senior vocational schools, 814 normal schools, 530 senior vocational mixed schools, 494 senior and junior vocational mixed schools, and 1,390 practical schools. Except for high schools and senior vocational schools, the remaining 3,037 schools should all set up Scouts according to the order. At least one Scout instructor is required per school. If the number of students in a school is too large, it must be increased to two or three. There are a total of 320,080 elementary schools in the country. If all elementary schools were to implement Cub Scouts, at least one instructor would be required per school. With such a large number, even in peacetime, the number of Scout instructors is insufficient. Moreover, during the War of Resistance, many Scout instructors switched to military and political circles. The number who retreated to the rear and continued to work in Scouting is limited, further exacerbating the shortage of Scout instructors. This spring, various primary and secondary schools and children's welfare institutions in Chongqing sent letters to the China Boy Scouts Association and the Chongqing Municipal Council requesting the introduction of Scout instructors, totaling more than ten places, but it was always difficult to find someone to introduce. If this is the case in Chongqing, the situation in the entire province of Sichuan can be imagined. Extending this to the rear provinces, wouldn't it be the same? This is why the cultivation of Scout instructors is so urgently needed.

Scout training is originally a type of education, and no one can deny this. Scout teachers are trained by normal schools, which is also a matter of course. This spring, the General Association of Boy Scouts of China sent a letter to the Ministry of Education ordering all normal colleges and normal schools to increase Scout courses, so that students can serve as primary and secondary school Scout teachers after graduation. One is to open up another path for normal school students, and the other is to add a large number of excellent teachers to the Scouts. The intention is sincere and good. There are a total of six normal colleges and 814 normal schools in the country. At least one-tenth of the graduates each year can serve as full-time primary and secondary school Scout teachers, and all graduates can serve as part-time Scout teachers. After a few years, all primary and secondary schools will have excellent Scout teachers. From this point of view, normal schools are the most suitable institutions for cultivating Scout instructors.

YMCA Prepares to Establish Student Service Society

The student department of the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA, due to the soaring prices of books, stationery, and daily necessities, has initiated the organization of a student service society to reduce the burden on students. It will collect old stationery and daily necessities from students in various schools and display them in the Household Goods Trading Society affiliated with the YWCA for consignment sales. The owners of old items that are no longer suitable can obtain economic income, while buyers can obtain needed items at low prices, which is truly a win-win situation. The society held its first general meeting on September 28th and is currently preparing to officially open on November 1st.

Relief Center for Out-of-School Children Holds Centralized Examination

The ten voluntary elementary schools and one central voluntary experimental elementary school established by the Relief Center for Poor and Out-of-School Children in this city have been fully opened, with a total of approximately one thousand students. The grade system is based on the regulations of the Ministry of Education, shortening the length of study, with the six-year primary school curriculum combined into four years. In order to save expenses, the original-grade complex system is adopted. Because each school has been open for more than a month, in order to examine the performance of the students, a centralized examination will be held starting today. The questions will be set by the center and distributed to the teachers of each school for the students to take. Those who perform well will be awarded prizes by the center to encourage them.

School News

### West League Football Rescheduled for This Week: Group A Ludo vs. French-Chinese Chamber of Commerce; Saturday Afternoon - 1:30 PM at Yiyuan; Tung Wah Lun Kong to Compete at Six Events

The 1939-40 West League football season, due to the rain delay last week, is scheduled to begin this week with the simultaneous opening of battles in Groups A, B, C, and Reserve. This week's schedule has a total of eight major battles on Saturday and Sunday, with four in Group A. However, the schedule differs from the one announced yesterday due to the location of the injuries. Within this month, Group A can only play four games per week (originally scheduled for five). The two games between Ludo vs. North-West and Tung Wah vs. French-Chinese Chamber of Commerce were postponed because there is a date specifically for makeup games, so they are not included in the schedule for this week. As a result, Tung Wah has a bye in Group A this week, while Ludo will move up the schedule from next week and instead play French-Chinese Chamber of Commerce at Yiyuan at 2:30 PM on Saturday. There is another Group A game on Saturday, between Portugal and West Fords. Both Group A games on Sunday belong to the West team, while in the Reserve Group, the two strong Chinese teams, Tung Wah and Ludo, will both compete at Jiaozhouyuan. Tung Wah is against Fu, while Ludo is against North-West. The Chinese team with the most games this week is Saturday's Group C Zhendan vs. Peide, and Youyou vs. Hertzberg, and Sunday's Group B Grolink vs. Survey. The schedule for the West League opening week is recorded below.

### Hong Kong Women's Basketball Team Forms to Conquer the Philippines

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Chinese Sports Advancement Association held a special executive committee meeting at the China Restaurant on the 6th floor at 1:15 PM on the 30th to discuss whether to send a women's basketball team to the Philippines to compete. Attendees included Chairman Xie Yuchuan, Li Huitang, Guo Mukai, He Shaoan, Lu Zhiqiang, Chen Zhiqing, Ye Guan　, Zhang Rensheng, and others. Zhong Zhiqiang stated that the organization of a women's basketball team to compete in the Philippines is currently underway. This time is different from when the women's basketball team went to the Philippines in 1933. Last time, it was a trip, but this time, the trip to the Philippines is because local people in the Philippines invited them to compete. The attendees were divided, and it was decided that it could not be done in the name of the Hong Kong Women's Basketball Team. Then Zhong Zhiqiang said that if that name could not be used, could he use a private organization to go to the Philippines to compete. It was then passed. Zhong then introduced Chen Rongtang, Li Chunyu, Yan Xiurong, Deng Yanhao, Lin Shaoping, Chen Huiqing, Huang Maizhen, Wu Ruixin, Nai Shangying, Chen Qizhen, and Ye Muzhen as eleven players to compete in the Philippines. However, the director of the basketball department must prove that they are amateurs, and then the basketball department will submit it to the Joint Association Committee for approval, and then a certificate will be issued.

### Finance   US Dollar Exchange Rate Turns Loose, British Gold Tight; US-British Exchange Rate Returns with Rising Shadow

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the gray market, the US-British exchange rate was generally calm and slightly loosened. In the early morning, due to overseas US-British exchange rate fluctuations, it suddenly rose by 1.125, causing the opening situation to be slightly tight at 0.03125 for the British pound, while the US dollar remained unaffected. After the opening, the market was unusually quiet, with very few transactions. Initially, a Japanese firm suddenly began buying, but Chinese merchants simultaneously sold. Moreover, apart from HSBC, foreign banks showed little interest, so the market appeared to harden slightly. However, HSBC seized the opportunity to absorb spot sterling, followed by opportunistic buying, so the market subtly leveled out. By noon, the buying spree had subsided, and the market hardened slightly again. In the afternoon, although there were some small-scale purchases, they had no impact. The market was quiet, and the closing price remained unchanged. In the end, the British pound tightened by 0.015625, while the US dollar rose by 0.03125. The futures situation was identical to the spot market. Trading occurred, with reports that some firms absorbed November US dollars and sold November British pounds at 9.667%. Trading was brisk in the morning but quiet in the afternoon.

Chinese Merchants Sell, Japanese Firms Buy

In the early morning, there were no cables from London regarding large denomination transactions or Bank of America prices. London spot gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates: British pound versus US dollar, Shanghai dollar, and French franc were all flat. US dollar rose against British pound by 1.125, fell against Shanghai dollar by 0.15, and rose against French franc by 0.5. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices: British gold at 4/5.53125, US dollar at 7.5, compared to last weekend, British pound was tighter by 0.03125, while the US dollar was unchanged, due to the exchange rate rebounding. After the opening, Chinese merchants showed some willingness to sell, and some foreign banks like Banque Belge pour l'Étranger also showed interest, so the market slightly hardened. It was estimated that Chinese merchants and foreign banks successively sold spot British gold at 4/5.53125 and 5625, and spot US dollar at 7.53125 and 5625 to Japanese firms. HSBC's listed prices were announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax also remained unchanged. Subsequently, HSBC suddenly absorbed spot British gold at 4/5.5625 from a certain bank. Simultaneously, a certain firm bought November US dollars at 7.4375 from Chinese merchants. Shortly after, a certain firm suddenly sold November British gold at 4/5 to a peer (the combined November US-British exchange rate was approximately 3.9667). Later, a certain firm suddenly absorbed spot British gold at 4/5.53125 and spot US dollar at 7.5 on behalf of a certain party from a peer, thus the process leveled out. By noon, the buying spree had subsided slightly, and the market trend slightly loosened again. At the noon close, banks' spot selling prices were: British gold at 4/5.546875, US dollar at 7.53125, compared to the morning open, British pound loosened by 0.015625, US dollar hardened by 0.03125.

Afternoon Market Was Extremely Quiet

The afternoon market was even quieter. It was reported that some firms still made small purchases, but prices remained unchanged. At the evening close, banks' spot selling prices were: British gold at 4/5.546875, US dollar at 7.53125. British gold for this month at 4/5.515625, US dollar at 7.46875. British gold for November at 4/5.453125, US dollar at 7.34375. As a result, compared to last weekend, both spot and forward British pounds were slightly tighter by 0.015625, while the US dollars were all slightly looser by 0.03125.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Six Yuan

Hong Kong, 16th (Telegraph). Today's exchange market opened stable, unchanged against British pound and Japanese yen. Spot US dollar was tighter by 0.0625, at 24.875. Forward rates were not quoted. Shanghai exchange rate rose by four yuan, to 325 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was calm. Spot US dollar loosened back by 0.0625, to 24.9375. Forward rates were also quoted, still at 24.8125. Shanghai exchange rate continued to rise by two yuan, to 327 yuan. At 2:30 PM, the market was stable, with no significant changes.

Tianjin US Dollar Exchange Rate Six and a Half Yuan

Spot British pound tightened by 0.125, at 3 pence 875. Spot US dollar contracted by 0.0625, at 6.5 yuan. Shanghai exchange rate still opened at 117 yuan. "Joint Note" gray market also traded at 86 yuan original price.

### Gold Market Lingers

Yesterday's cash gold gray market situation: Although foreign exchange rates reported loosening, and negative news such as our army's victories filled the market, ultimately, due to fierce and astonishing buying, the closing price was one yuan higher than the previous day. At the initial opening, exchange bills were slightly looser, priced at 4012 yuan, about 11 yuan lower. Subsequently, the Hong Kong gang started buying, causing the price to rise. However, soon other gangs sold, and overwhelmed by the sellers, the price plummeted to the day's low of 4006 yuan. But the Hong Kong gang refused to show weakness and bought a lot, finally pushing the price up to the day's high of 4028 yuan. The noon close was at 4016 yuan. In the afternoon, a gold firm sold, pushing the price down a few yuan. From then until the close, the Hong Kong gang's buying interest remained strong, no less than in the morning, so the closing price was 4024 yuan. Trading was brisk throughout the day, approximately 1300 taels. Jewelers' ornamental gold remained unchanged. Customs gold, etc., remained stable.

Cash Gold Without Major Fluctuations

Since the early morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened with reports of firmer foreign exchange rates, and market sentiment was relatively weak. The opening price immediately traded down 11 yuan, with money changers trading 30 taels at 4012 yuan. After the opening, money changers again traded 10 taels at 4010 yuan. At that time, the Hong Kong gang suddenly became active. For a moment, sellers were watching. The price jumped 7 yuan. A certain jeweler bought 30 taels from a peer at 4017 yuan, then raised the price by 3 yuan. Money changers bought 20 taels from a gold firm at 4020 yuan. Subsequently, because money changers, gold firms, and jeweler gangs showed a strong willingness to sell, they supplied endlessly to each other. Although the Hong Kong gang was still buying at that time, it was not as strong as in the beginning. Soon, the price dropped 10 yuan. A jeweler gang sold 10 taels to a gold firm at 4010 yuan. After that, the securities gang came to buy, causing the price to rise by 6 yuan. The securities gang bought 20 taels from a gold firm at 4016 yuan. Then, because a cash gold firm started selling again, and buyers were weak, the price immediately dropped 10 yuan. A cash gold firm sold 20 taels to the securities gang at 4006 yuan. Later, it was reported that foreign exchange rates had rebounded from loose to flat, and buyers gradually increased. Shortly after, the price returned above the 4010 yuan mark. At that time, the Hong Kong gang came to buy vigorously again, more than 500 taels, and then rose again by more than 10 yuan. A certain jeweler bought 20 taels from money changers at 4028 yuan. At noon, the Hong Kong gang stopped buying and watched, and it was reported that foreign exchange rates had slightly firmed again. The price could not sustain and fell back 13 yuan. Money changers traded 10 taels at 4015 yuan, then money changers bought 20 taels from a gold firm at 4016 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opened calmly. Initially, money changers traded 10 taels at 4017 yuan, then a certain gold firm came to sell, pushing the price down 5 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 30 taels to money changers at 4012 yuan. After entering, the Hong Kong gang suddenly commissioned a certain gold firm and a certain jeweler to buy strongly, immediately raising the price by 12 yuan. A certain jeweler bought 30 taels from money changers, and a certain gold firm bought 10 taels from money changers, both at 4024 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to last weekend, the price rose by 1 yuan. The selling price of cash gold firms' own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than smelted gold, and purchases had to be reduced by about 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Ornamental Gold Remains at Original Price

Jewelers' ornamental gold per tael remained unchanged throughout the day because smelted gold had no major fluctuations. Datonghang still suspended the original price of 405 yuan. New peers are same with higher price, and purchases had to be reduced by about 20 yuan.

### Securities Market Quiet; Jardine Matheson Shares Hit New High

Securities gray market: Yesterday's market situation, after the sharp rise on Saturday, yesterday's trend still showed a continuous upward momentum. The so-called peaceful atmosphere was just a flash in the pan. There were also rumors of continued issuance of public bonds in the market, so the bond market trended sideways, waiting for new news to help. Throughout yesterday, although the volume of buying and selling was not large, the style remained consistent. Companies such as Tiansheng, Lianhe, and Dafeng consistently bought throughout the morning and afternoon, while companies such as Hongda and Datong consistently sold throughout the morning and afternoon. The rest, such as Hongkang and Maotai, favored buying, while Defu, Lianyi, and Tongyu favored selling. Because there were no large inflows or outflows, the market price trended sideways and was dull. According to the results of the day, most stocks continued to perform well, rising 0.05 to 0.25. However, Class D bonds, because they did not trade on Saturday afternoon, rose by 0.95 alone. The total number of transactions was 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: Shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, because dividends are about to be issued, the market price has been raised to above 9 yuan, but there is a shortage of goods in the market and there have been no transactions. In addition, the Public Industry Association reported that although the stock market only had an hour of trading in the afternoon, it was still exceptionally active. Jardine Matheson shares rose to an unprecedented high of 66 yuan, which is noteworthy. Shares of International Trust Company also rose to 7 yuan. Other stocks had little change. Interest in rubber stocks was also idle. The consumption of American rubber in September was 55,100 tons, maintaining the high level of the previous month. The inventory for the same month was 150,200 tons, a decrease of 11,000 tons. This inventory is now only sufficient for three months of supply, which has fallen to a dangerous level, so it must be replenished quickly to avoid serious situations. The excess of the spot price of raw rubber over the futures price in the New York market is a direct consequence of this situation.

### Swedish Rong Iron Factory

Regular Shareholders Meeting Convened

Rubber Trust to Pay Dividends

The Rubber Trust Co., Ltd., managed by Huitong Yanghang in this city, has now been resolved by the board of directors to pay the second interim dividend for the one-year period ending September 1939, starting from October 25, at 0.15 per share in national currency. The first dividend was also 0.15, for a total of 0.30 in national currency. The British-owned Swedish Rong Iron Factory Co., Ltd., managed by Anli Yanghang in this city, will convene an extraordinary shareholders meeting on November 10 to discuss the liquidation of the company and to determine the liquidation accountant and liquidator.

### Yarn and Cotton: Buyers' Enthusiasm Wanes; Cotton Yarn Difficult to Rebound

The yarn market is still in a stable situation, but the trend is slightly uneven. Market prices rise and fall differently, and the market is still quiet, so transactions are even less. As for general operators, they slightly reveal a feeling of discouragement, and they are very cold to the current concept of going long, so the momentum presents a state of hesitation and uncertainty. From the perspective of the general situation, due to poor digestion, the future may be difficult to rebound.

The opening of the current yarn market in the morning is still a scattered atmosphere as usual. The opening is delayed for a long time, but there are few buyers. The spot price of 20 count Double Horse Foreign Warehouse is 710 yuan, down 9 yuan. Although there are many people calling out on the warehouse receipts, there is a lack of buyers. The opening price is 692 yuan, and after a while, a snatching buying spree suddenly rises, and it returns to 720 yuan. Finally, due to the lack of real demand, it trends downward again. The closing price of 20 count Double Horse is 713 yuan. After checking the transaction in half a day, the statistics are 842 bales. The market price of Double Horse fell 9.5 yuan, Double Earth fell 6.5 yuan, and Tiannv fell 8 yuan, but 20 count Shepherd rose 7 yuan. The factory opened 200 bales of 10 count new Yi yarn from Hongzhang Factory, priced at 565 yuan. The amount of each gang buying is listed below: Peers 085 Hong Kong 205 Mainland 145 Xiamen 72 Jiangxi 115 Ningbo 20 Total 842

### Cotton Factory Demand Reduced; More Than 4,000 Bales of General Cotton Arrive

The cotton business is still sustainable, but the factory's buying interest is strange. The yarn market is not good, and the sales channels are narrow, so the intention to add raw materials is very weak, so transactions are greatly reduced. As for the peers, in view of the above situation, buying and selling is not as lively as in the past. The daily factory is also dull as always, so the cotton market has nothing to be proud of, but the momentum is stable. The source of cotton from northern Jiangsu is still uninterrupted. In the past two days, another 4,419 bales have arrived. The current cotton sales situation is listed below: Tongzhou 135.00 136.00 Peers 500 bales Changyinsha 134 Peers 200 bales Huoji 130.75 Peers 120 bales Taicang Cotton 139.00 Xinsheng 500 bales Brazil 173.00 Wanchang 20 pieces

Another message: The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is due to the stability of the exchange rate, and there is no improvement in the transaction. All parties are looking forward to it. The factory's intention to buy is very weak, and the peers are temporarily unwilling to sell. Moreover, the arrival of Tongzhou goods in recent days is very crowded, so the trading of foreign cotton is quite quiet.

Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was very quiet in the morning? All industries are waiting and watching because of the weekend. The telegrams from Mumbai all reported a fall, and later, due to southern hedging sales and long positions closing, the closing price fell 12 pounds compared to the previous day. India, including the forecast, fell 3 rupees, and Egypt rose 35 pounds.

### Grains: Guest Indica Rice Rebounds; Broken New Japonica Rice Without Changes

Since the Du Lai market has implemented the rectification of trading rules, there are an unusually large number of customers from various places visiting the market, and the weather is turning cloudy, and people's hearts are towards prosperity, and guests have successively inquired about the local customers yesterday, and at the beginning of the market, the various guest traders shouted up half a yuan to one yuan or so, The Jiangbei Jian opened at 19.1 yuan yesterday, Nanjing No. 1 Nanguan Jian opened at 19 yuan, No. 2 at 19.3 yuan, Zhong at 19 yuan, Wuhu Jian from 19.5 yuan to 18.25 yuan, and Yanglu Jian also improved by two or three corners. The price of Suzhou Kunfeng Jia Yang Jian was 23.2 yuan to 21.5 yuan, and the price of Lu Jian was 23.67 yuan to 22 yuan. The prices of various broken japonica rice were too far apart from the new goods, and there was a lack of special goods, which were all medium grades, so transactions were not smooth and prices did not change. It is estimated that the regular help special break opened at 32 yuan, the city at 30 yuan, and the middle at 28.3 yuan. Wuxi High Break 30 yuan to 27 yuan, Suzhou Tong Help Break 26.5 yuan. As new japonica rice arrived one after another, there was not much fluctuation. The opening price of Changzhou new japonica rice was 28 yuan, Kunshan new japonica rice was 27 yuan to 26 yuan, and Suzhou Tong Help Japonica rice was 26 yuan to 24 yuan. There were not many shipments of Baige rice, and the guests selected good quality, because the quality of the broken goods was soft and easy to change, resulting in different thoughts between buyers and sellers, resulting in a situation of increasing the price of special goods, which rose by more than one yuan. If the special Baige rice of Fengjia opened at 19.2 yuan, the city was 17.4 yuan, and the next was 16.5 yuan. Only one or two hundred bags of Qingjiao kiln species arrived these days, which are also unusually tight, initially shouting 31 yuan, and later actually selling 30.05 yuan and 30 yuan, and also rose by more than one yuan. Change Yuan is average, old is 31 yuan to 30 yuan, and new is 25 to 26 yuan. The total number of goods arriving in the city was more than 4,000 bags, and the number of transactions was 14,000 to 15,000 bags.

The arrival of guest indica rice decreased yesterday. Except for the continuous arrival of stored rice in Wuhu, Nanjing, etc., the production price of indica rice in Jiangbei was not loose, and the medium-grade goods with low prices had to lose money. Therefore, apart from the suspension of business by brokers, they were unwilling to lightly sell new arrivals and previous deposits with the market. Benke took advantage of the low price to absorb, and each of the inland and hoarders took more than 1,000 bags, and the village of Benjie was also quite lively, so the price rebounded by 0.5 yuan to 0.6 or 0.7 yuan. The price of high-quality guest indica rice has reached 20 yuan, regardless of medium-grade.

### Flour Factory Market: Raised to 7.2 Yuan, Wheat Also Follows Up by 0.4 Yuan

Flour: Yesterday's market has implemented the upgrading of the field, and the buying interest from the north and south foreign gangs and the mainland is commendable, but the factory's willingness to sell is very firm, and the return of goods is even less supplied. It is heard that the new warehouse receipt price of the Red and Blue Car is 7.27 yuan, the price of the warship brand transit goods is 7.13 yuan, and the price of the Phoenix brand in October is also 6.9 yuan, which is 0.2 or 0.3 yuan higher than last week. It is also heard that the foreign powder is out of stock, and the European war peace is disappointing, people's hearts are good, and 1,000 bags of Double Eagle brand have been traded, and the price has risen to 7.8 yuan. The bat brand buyers are not greedy, and there is no proper transaction for the time being. Wheat: Yesterday's market also tended to improve, and the source was not strong. More than 10,000 bags arrived in two days. The powder market has been on the rise for several days, and the raw materials have followed suit. Yesterday, the factory's buying interest was quite strong, and the hoarders' sales were also lively. Fufu and other factories took more than 6,000 bags of goods from Guandian, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Luhe, and Anqing, and the hoarders took six cars of wheat from Guandian, Kunshan, and Danyang. The market was about 0.4 yuan higher than last weekend.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Falls First and Then Returns

Yesterday, the price of soybean oil fluctuated greatly, with a difference of 1.2 or 1.3 yuan during the day. In the early morning, the general floating hoards were eager to come out of the market, carrying on the exhausted momentum of last week. Kobe oil first fell by 0.6 yuan, and other oils followed suit by 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. After entering the market, the inland Xichang gang suddenly came to drag in, and the market was immediately invigorated. Large households took the opportunity to reverse the trend, and as a result, the market prices of various oils returned to the original prices of last Friday, and Kobe oil rose by 0.6 yuan. The highest price was 66 yuan. A total of 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded in the market (the price is detailed in the market price column), 80 pieces of Yanqi oil, 50 pieces of Qingqi oil, 36 barrels of Kobe oil, 115 barrels of Lian oil, 150 cans of Baijiao canned oil, 700 pieces of peanut oil were traded in this street, and the opening price was 57.5 yuan, which was 0.3 yuan lower than the previous market.

The trend of the association's allocation is very tight. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar continued to rise by about 2 yuan, the price of the warehouse goods in this warehouse was 53.5 yuan, the initial price of the goods in the foreign warehouse was 54.1 yuan, and then it rose to 54.5 yuan.

The price of Taikoo car white sugar rose by 1.5 yuan, the price of the B-mark of the east warehouse was 58.6 yuan, the price of the west warehouse was 59 yuan, and the rest was refunded.

### North-South Goods: Jiangbei Peanuts Offer New Products; The Price Opens at 23 Yuan Per Load

Jiangbei's new peanuts were transferred from Wuxi to two batches yesterday, one with 78 bags and the other with 90 bags, and they were immediately opened. The price was 23 yuan per market load. According to the Qingdao letter, 120 bags of new peanuts arrived, and they were taken away by the foreign stores, and the price was 16 yuan. The price of raw peanuts was looser, and the price of old goods was reduced by 1 yuan. 58 bags were taken away by the oil mill at that place at 26 yuan. The number of stocks has been scarce. More than 200 bags of new raw peanuts arrived, and they were reduced by 2 yuan. The price of 24 yuan was taken into by foreign stores and Shenbang, etc., and the price was 24 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Peers' Stocks Are Full, Cotton Cloth Transactions Are Light, and Dongpi Is Tired and Cannot Be Revived

The cloth market has been sluggish due to poor sales to customers, the stocks of peers in this street are full, the hoarders are watching and not moving, and the retail households have little resale, so the transactions are light, and the market price has fallen down and down. The price of white goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill has fallen by about 0.1 yuan, and the price of fine cloth and fine twill has fallen by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan. The price of some dyed and printed cloth has also continued to fall (per piece) by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. The price of various flannels that are currently in season is stable due to the shallow stock, but it is not as brisk as before. Customer sales in South Road and abroad are slightly decorated. The Yunnan gang handles 30 or 40 boxes of color cloth, color twill, cheongsam, and strip bleached cloth, the Guangdong gang handles nearly 50 pieces of flannel, color cloth, color twill, and coarse cloth, the Yong gang handles 70 or 80 pieces of color twill, color cloth, and coarse cloth, and the Min gang handles more than 20 boxes of color cloth and color twill.

The current price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth spot goods has fallen to 20.01 to 0.02 yuan per piece yesterday, and the price of fine twill high-grade brands has also fallen below 20 yuan. The Longtou sales opened at 19.25 yuan, and the market atmosphere was sluggish. The reason is that the actual transaction is deserted, and non-industry hoarders are eager to get rid of the goods, which leads to a straight-line decline and fatigue cannot be revived. The price of color goods, Four Gentlemen Serge, opened at 0.65 yuan per yard, and the price of Zhigong was 0.66 yuan, which was also 0.7 or 0.8 cents per yard lower than the peak market price.

### Market Conditions Record

The foreign currency weakened uniformly yesterday. Although the exchange market and gold prices were not very different, the foreign currency showed a tired trend. The initial US dollar note was as high as 13.523 yuan, and then gradually dropped to 13.4 yuan. In the afternoon, it was suddenly reported that there was a great victory in northern Jiangxi, and most of the colleagues thought it was small, and finally retreated to 13.38 yuan, and the result was a reduction of 0.04 yuan. The British gold pound notes fell 0.5 yuan, and the US dollar also fell 0.5 yuan. The Hong Kong ticket was lower by 0.02 yuan, the French franc ticket was lower by 0.005 yuan, and the Singapore ticket, the Dutch ticket, the Rupee ticket, and the Philippine ticket all fell 0.2 yuan.

Kaiping General Coal Arrives New. Kaiping Anthracite Coal has been obstructed by shipping in the past, and there are few incoming goods, which is only enough for the sales offices to sell, so the door shops have long since disappeared. A few days ago, Yitaixing made various efforts to bring in 3,200 tons of Kaiping general coal, which was transshipped on the Yangjingbang to the upper warehouse, and the estimated price of each ton of screened blocks was 80 yuan, the general cargo was 70 yuan, the No. 1 chips was 74 yuan, and the No. 2 chips was 67 yuan, both in current cash transactions, and the delivery to the customers' homes was to be added separately.

### Problems of Road Construction Beyond the Boundary; The Bureau of Works Appeals to the Diplomatic Body; The Tax-grabbing Intention of the Puppet Side Is Very Obvious, and the Diplomatic Body Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss the Response

The puppet government in the road construction area beyond the boundary in western Shanghai has repeatedly sent puppet police to occupy the guard posts of the patrol room, and piled sandbags on the sidewalks built by the Bureau of Works and sent puppet police to guard them. Recently, it has tried to seize taxes in the road construction area beyond the boundary. The Bureau of Works is extremely dissatisfied with these illegal acts. It is reported that it has submitted a report to the consular corps, and made an appeal to the consuls general of various countries related to the Public Concession. After consideration, it has been decided to convene a meeting of the consular corps in the near future to discuss the future response policy.

The Puppet Side Covets Millions of Donation Taxes

It is reported that the biggest purpose of the puppet government is to seize the donation taxes in the area. In the first half of this year, the house donation land tax actually collected by the Bureau of Works in the road construction area beyond the boundary totaled 528,642 yuan, and the estimated annual income listed in the budget is 931,000 yuan. This number is almost one million yuan, so the puppet "municipal government" under the wing of the Japanese is thinking of coveting it, because the subsidies of the "Renovation Government" to the puppet municipal government have been stopped.

The Authorities Said That They Would Never Give Up

As for the attitude of the Bureau of Works towards the road construction question beyond the boundary, the roads are purchased and built by the Bureau of Works in accordance with the authority stipulated in the land regulations, so the residents living on both sides of the roads should pay rent and land tax to the Bureau of Works, and the residents living in the alleys beyond the road construction, if they use the public facilities such as ditches, pipes, lights, and tap water built by the Bureau of Works, they must also pay donations and taxes according to regulations. Recently, the puppet "municipal government" has also tried to collect donations and taxes in the area, but the result is unknown.

Interference With Police Power, The Patrol Room Does Not Pay Attention

The Bureau of Works spends a lot of money every year on road construction beyond the boundary, such as hygiene work and fire fighting work. Up to now, the way the puppet "municipal government" interferes is to try to interfere with the patrol room of the Bureau of Works in exercising its duties. Although the puppet "municipal government" had previously promised that it would only exercise its duties outside the road construction road beyond the boundary, it has now clearly violated what it said. The recent development has also expanded the scope, and it is trying to seize the traffic guard posts of the two red and green lights on Yidingpan Road (one is on Daxilu, only one is at the intersection of Yuyuan Road). It sent a final notice to the patrol room, saying that the two red and green lights there would be prohibited from being used from now on, but the patrol room ignored it. This is a new illegal incident in addition to sending donation tickets to the residents.

### Philippine Vice President Discusses Philippine Politics

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, Philippine Vice President Sergio Osmeña, upon his return to the Philippines from the United States, passed through Shanghai and stayed for several days. This morning (the 16th), when interviewed by reporters, he warmly praised the newly appointed U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Paul McNutt. It is said that the people of the Philippines will give McNutt a grand welcome, as he is a virtuous and capable man whom Osmeña greatly admires. The Philippine government sent him to the United States to pursue certain economic revisions and seek changes in tax rates. During his stay in the United States, he had the opportunity to work with McNutt, who provided him with full assistance.

### Establishment of the Tydings-McDuffie Act

Regarding the approval of the Tydings-McDuffie Act for complete Philippine independence, Vice President Osmeña stated that he believes the Philippine problem has been correctly resolved politically by the laws passed by the U.S. Congress. Therefore, he is confident that there will be no other developments except for the establishment of a fully independent Philippine government on July 4, 1946.

### This Trip Was Solely an Economic Mission

Osmeña declined to comment on the political situation in the Far East and Europe but reiterated that his trip to the United States was purely economic in nature. He originally planned to depart from San Francisco on the *President Cleveland* to travel with old friends like McNutt, but it did not work out. However, he met with McNutt again in Japan and attended a banquet hosted by U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew. It is reported that Vice President Osmeña will stay in Shanghai until Sunday, when he will take a boat to Hong Kong. He hopes to stay in Hong Kong for several days before returning to Manila on the *Victoria*.

### Keen Interest in Touring Shanghai

According to *The China Press*, Philippine Vice President Sergio Osmeña arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) aboard the French ship *Félix Roussel*. However, his whereabouts yesterday were difficult to ascertain, as this prominent Philippine political leader, welcomed by several Chinese friends, spent most of the day sightseeing and visiting friends. Osmeña is staying at the Park Hotel. According to news obtained last night, he is not expected to depart for Manila before the middle of this week. He came to Shanghai from Japan. It is also reported that related organizations in the city will host a public banquet for Osmeña on the 18th of this month.

### Britain Establishes Intelligence Branch in the Far East

According to the *North China Daily News*, Mr. Scott, the former financial assistant advisor to the British Embassy in China, has now been appointed as the head of the Far East branch of the British Intelligence Department. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) and will establish headquarters in Hong Kong. Reynold Packard, the Tokyo correspondent for the London *Daily Mail*, has been appointed as the assistant director of the Far East branch of the Intelligence Department and arrived in Tokyo on Thursday. His main office will be located there. According to a Tokyo dispatch yesterday from the Japanese Domei News Agency, Packard denied the claim that the British government intends to allocate ten million yuan to cover propaganda expenses in the Far East. Packard, on behalf of the British government, formally reaffirmed that although the Western Front is relatively calm at present, Britain is determined to "fight to the finish." Packard also mentioned the situation in London, saying that there are air raid alerts in London, but no enemy planes have yet arrived.

### Bank of Communications Resumes Operations in Shanghai Yesterday Morning After Evacuation The rumor about Leasing is False

After the old site of the Bank of Communications headquarters on Hankou Road and the Bund was forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese military police headquarters, the various branches of the Bank of Communications that had evacuated from Shanghai resumed operations yesterday and restored receipts and payments. The recruitment examination for probationary employees will continue after a suitable location is found, but the training class for bank employees has been forced to suspend. The details are as follows:

### Operations Resumed Yesterday

The various branches of the Bank of Communications that had evacuated from Shanghai resumed operations at their original locations yesterday morning and are handling the temporary joint communications office for the various branches of the Bank of Communications that had evacuated from Shanghai, including the three regions of Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang: (1) The Zhejiang region includes Hangzhou, Wuxing, Jiaxing; (2) The Zhenjiang region includes Zhenjiang, Taixing, Taizhou, Nantong, Rugao, Dongtai, Yancheng, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Huaicheng, Qingjiangpu, Suqian, Huangqiao, Jiangyan, and Qintong; (3) The Shanghai region includes Changzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Danyang, Liyang, Bengbu, Wuhu, Xuancheng, Xinpu, Banpu, etc., totaling more than thirty branches.

### Use Main Entrance

The temporary joint office of the various evacuated branches of the Bank of Communications opened the main entrance at No. 14 Huangpu Road yesterday morning. Anyone making payments, recieving, or inquiring for the evacuated branches should use the main entrance from now on. The alley entrance on Hankou Road, which was previously used for entry and exit, has been changed to a back door, and the door to the staircase leading to the third and fourth floors has been completely locked. Regarding the recruitment examination for probationary employees, the examination questions and application documents have been moved out and it has been decided to continue processing in the short term. The bank will publish an announcement in the newspaper regarding the location and date. However, the training class for bank employees has been temporarily suspended due to the forced requisition of the location.

### No Leasing

After the third and fourth floors of the old Bank of Communications headquarters were forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese side for use as dormitories for the personnel of the Japanese military police headquarters, they all used the side door at the street number on Hankou Road for entry and exit, with an elevator directly to the third and fourth floors. However, after negotiations with the police, the Japanese side still occupies the site and has not withdrawn. As for rumors that the matter will be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for discussion, the reporter met with a certain Chinese director yesterday and learned that the matter has not been proposed on the agenda for the next board meeting, so the rumor about the discussion cannot be confirmed. As for the leasing news reported yesterday regarding the Bank of Communications, according to investigations, it is not true.

### Local Groups Launch "Respecting Integrity and Shame" Campaign Promote Moral Values and Uphold National Righteousness; Immediate Discussion of Campaign Advancement Measures

In view of the recent decline in moral values and the loss of integrity and shame, even among those with status and prestige in society, who disregard shame and are obsessed with power and serve the enemy, at this time of serious national crisis, leading figures from local industrial, commercial, educational, and charitable organizations, such as Yan Shengsan, Wang Zhicheng, Ye Fengdi, and Zhu Chengfu, could not bear to stand idly by.

### Unwilling to Stand Idly By

The spread of this trend will affect the war of resistance and shake the foundations of the country. Therefore, at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (the 16th), they held a dinner party at the YMCA in Baixianqiao to launch a "Respecting Integrity and Shame" campaign. More than 130 people attended. Luo Ziqiang was elected as chairman to report on the significance of launching the integrity and shame campaign and stated that this campaign is purely motivated by

The meeting adjourned after the discussion.

### Repayment of Principal and Interest on National Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds

After the National Defense Bonds of the 27th Year of the Republic of China (1938) and the Gold Bonds of the 27th Year of the Republic of China (1938) were issued at face value on May 1 of last year, the Ministry of Finance sent letters to various agencies and organizations to encourage people across the country and overseas Chinese to subscribe. Subscriptions were very enthusiastic. October 31 of this year is the first date for repayment of principal and payment of interest on these two bonds. The ministry has already allocated funds from the designated fund and handed them over to the National Debt Fund Management Committee of the Central Bank.

### Sanmin Youth League Sends Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek to Congratulate Victory

With the decisive battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies outside Changsha, and with the Chinese army repeatedly capturing important towns in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces within a period of ten days, local civil groups sent telegrams to Chongqing and the front-line soldiers to congratulate the victory and express their condolences. The members of the Sanmin Youth League are spread throughout the provinces. It is now known that the General Headquarters of the Military Celebrations received a telegram from the Shanghai Branch of the League to General Chiang Kai-shek, forwarding condolences to the commanders of various war zones and all the soldiers, which stated, in brief: "With the repeated capture of important towns in Hunan and Jiangxi and the joyous news being reported, the people are delighted and encouraged, and we send our condolences and express our respects."

### "New Taikoo Maru" Sinks Outside Xingang Violated Regulations by Carrying Too Many Passengers and Cargo; Hull Ruptured, Leading to Sudden Accident

More Than Four Hundred Passengers, Only Over One Hundred Rescued

Since March of this year, foreign merchant ships sailing the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, passing through the ports of Tongzhou, Chongming, Qidong, Haimen, and Jingjiang, have frequently encountered obstruction by the Japanese navy, resulting in a sharp decline in business and many closures. Initially, there were thirty to forty ships operating on the above-mentioned routes, but now there are fewer than ten, including *Jiangding*, *Luan*, *Luokang*, *Keisden*, and *Lisha*. Shipping to ports under the jurisdiction of Jingjiang County (i.e., Longwokou) is completely dominated by Japanese merchants. Foreign merchant ships are not allowed to operate. To operate a port, it is necessary to have a Japanese merchant background and fly the Japanese flag. Currently, the North and South Ocean Lines and Yangtze River Lines owned by the Japanese Nisshin Kisen Kaisha have been merged into the East Asia Shipping Company. However, the small steamers operating on the Chongming Line are still managed by Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, including *New Taikoo Maru* and *Dahua Maru*, which operate on the port line, and *Zhejiang Maru* and *Qingning Maru*, which operate on the Chongming line.

### Departure Yesterday Morning, Sank at Noon

The *New Taikoo Maru* has a displacement of 108 tons and a hull length of 118 feet. Yesterday morning, at Pier 2 on the Bund, it loaded a full cargo of goods and more than 400 passengers, departing for ports such as Kou’an and Xingang. Unexpectedly, 11 nautical miles from the mouth of the Wusong River, at 12:45 p.m., the ship sank due to being overloaded and having more passengers than the allowed number of 150 (the company admitted to over 200). The hull ruptured and sank. When the accident occurred,

### Jardine Matheson Iron Barge Encountered and Rescued

The Jardine Matheson Company's *Hanhe* (an iron barge) happened to be returning to Shanghai from Beishahu, carrying cotton. Seeing the *New Taikoo Maru* sinking, it immediately sailed to the side of the ship to rescue and sent a telegram to Shanghai. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha received the telegram and immediately dispatched the small steamer *Qingshan Maru*, which rushed to the rescue at around 2:00 p.m. yesterday. A nearby Japanese destroyer also arrived at the scene to assist in the rescue.

### Cause of Accident Worthy of Attention

It is said that the *Hanhe* rescued more than 60 people. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, but due to the above-mentioned circumstances, it was delayed until around 6:00 p.m. It was expected to arrive last night. The cause of the accident was entirely due to excessive cargo and too many passengers, resulting in this unfortunate incident. The Japanese destroyer that helped with the rescue also rescued 49 passengers and entered the port at around 7:00 p.m. last night, sailing directly to the South Huangpu. It is said that injured passengers were sent to the hospital by the ship for treatment.

### Sudden Change in Climate Northern China's Atmospheric Pressure Rises Hurricane Sweeps Over Shanghai's Eastern Waters; High Tides Continue, Water Level Has Not Receded

The weather in this city has changed dramatically due to the influence of a small high-pressure system in northern China. The temperature has dropped, the wind has picked up, and rain has been intermittent. The highest temperature at 10:00 a.m. yesterday dropped to 71.1 degrees, compared to 75 degrees at 10:00 a.m. the day before.

### Severe Hurricane Advances Rapidly Northward

According to the Observatory, another hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean, and the wind force is quite strong. At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, it had advanced to 27 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude, with the center of the wind force within 60 nautical miles, advancing rapidly in a north-northeast direction. According to the reported position, the hurricane has moved near the Ryukyu Islands. At 5:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the Observatory continued to report that the hurricane had advanced to 29 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude, with the center within 60 nautical miles, still moving in a north-northeast direction. According to the reported position, the hurricane has reached southwest of Kyushu Island in Japan and will pass approximately 400 nautical miles east of Shanghai. As a result, the climate in this city is also disturbed by it, with strong winds and heavy rain throughout the day. When the wind picked up, there were a total of five wind forces.

### Sudden Climate Change; High Tides Continue

Yesterday afternoon at 4:20 p.m., dark clouds gathered, the sky darkened, forming a dim state, lasting for several minutes before it cleared slightly. Also, before 3:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the highest temperature was only 72.1 degrees, while the highest temperature at the same time the day before was 82.4 degrees, a sudden drop of more than ten degrees. The difference between the hot and cold weather in one day can be said to be significant. The Huangpu River still had a high tide at 2:10 p.m. yesterday, measuring more than 11 feet. As a result, the low-lying streets and sewers were inundated with water, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, Guizhou Road, Gansu Road, Avenue Foch, Avenue Joffre, Avenue Haig, and Avenue du Roi Albert, etc.

### In the Cold Wind and Bitter Rain Puppets Perform Dramatically The Parade Was Blocked Midway and Departed Sadly; Very Few Guests Attended the Puppet Government's Reception

Yesterday was the anniversary of the establishment of the puppet "Municipal Government." To make a grand show of it, the various puppet organizations decorated their doors in a big way yesterday. However, the weather was unfavorable, with heavy wind and rain for several days. The color arches built in front of the puppet municipal government were blown down by the strong wind. It was originally planned to build an arch under the Baidu Bridge, but it was prevented by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The conical arch at the intersection of Qijiang Road and North Sichuan Road also lost its color after being blown by the cold wind and bitter rain. The red cloths with congratulatory words written on them, which were tied on the piers of Baidu Bridge and Sichuan Road Bridge, were torn by the strong wind. From 12:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. yesterday, the puppet municipal police局 used the Guangdong Grand Theater before "August 13th," now renamed the Fumin Grand Theater, as the venue for a recreational event. There were six puppet police officers standing in front of the theater. The programs performed, in addition to martial arts, were mostly outdated old dramas, and there were very few spectators.

### Parade Blocked

At 3:00 p.m., the puppet side sent more than 20 trucks, each carrying two or three people wearing short jackets and untidy suits. White bamboo cloth banners with congratulatory words were hung on the sides of the trucks. The people in the trucks all held small five-color flags, Taijitu flags, and colorful triangular flags. They arrived at North Sichuan Road, intending to pass through Sichuan Road Bridge and drive towards western Shanghai. When the trucks reached the top of Sichuan Road Bridge, they were stopped by the guards at the southern pier and prohibited from passing. One side reported to the military authorities stationed there. After consultation between the two sides, the British troops believed that if the slogans and flags on the trucks could be completely removed, they would be allowed to pass. After a standoff until 3:20 p.m., the puppet side complied, collected the slogans and flags, and was allowed to slowly drive across Sichuan Road Bridge, two trucks at a time. A total of six trucks were allowed to pass in three batches.

### Pathetic Situation

Unexpectedly, less than a hundred steps after crossing the bridge, these six trucks raised the slogans and flags and shouted slogans. The police believed that this would disrupt public order and detained the last two trucks, escorting them away. At this time, traffic was also cut off, but single pedestrians could still pass. The trucks that stopped on the bridge had now driven to the southern pier and were also stopped by the police. One side immediately called the police, and at 3:30 p.m., two red police vehicles arrived, facing the trucks parked at the southern pier from a distance, and the situation suddenly became tense. Seeing the police vehicles arriving, the people on the trucks were unwilling to be outdone and raised a large five-color flag of more than ten feet. The strong wind and heavy rain made the flag even more colorless, and the ignorant workers on the trucks had nowhere to hide. The situation was quite pathetic. At the same time, two trucks of fully armed British soldiers arrived at the entrance of the British Navy Youth Club at No. 630 Sichuan Road, carrying guns and ammunition, stationed inside to prevent the situation from escalating.

### Departs Sadly

According to people coming from the northern pier, there were still fifteen trucks parked on that side, and several trucks of armed Japanese soldiers also arrived, making the situation even more tense. At this time, a Japanese officer came from the north side of the bridge, walked to the front of the two red police vehicles, looked around, and peered into the vehicles. The police did not stop him. In this situation, after a standoff for two hours, the red police vehicles finally left at 5:50 p.m. After a while, the trucks parked at the southern pier also lowered their flags and drums, decided to drive over, and drove around Suzhou Road. Traffic was also restored.

### End Hastily

According to foreign sources, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the puppet "Municipal Government" held an anniversary of its establishment in the "City Center" Building. The puppet "Mayor" was scheduled to host 1,500 guests, but very few people accepted the invitation. Westerners who attended included Frankling, Chairman of the Municipal Council; Philip, Director-General and Director of the Municipal Council; Jobert, Chief of the French Concession Police; Bowen, Chief of the Municipal Council Police; Jones, a famous lawyer; and Fischer, the German Consul-General. No British or American consuls attended. There were many flags hung there. When 10:00 a.m. arrived, after the transmission of the speech, other puppet members and Japanese naval and army officers gave speeches in succession. After entering, they inspected eight teams of puppet police, took photos, and dispersed. In addition to the banquet, each participating "guest" was given a specially made flower bouquet and a silver badge tied with a silk ribbon or tassel. The puppet police stationed along the way were not carrying guns. "Matsui Road," the main road leading to the "City Center," had puppet police stationed, who were polite, but each guest's car had to be checked before being allowed to pass. Finally, according to foreign sources, the puppet side spent as much as 400,000 yuan on this "celebration."

### Still Not Acting on Behalf of Soviet Affairs Awaiting Moscow Telegram

Regarding the Soviet consulates in the four occupied areas of Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, and Zhangjiakou, which have been ordered to close, the affairs they left behind have been entrusted to the Norwegian consulates in the above-mentioned areas to handle. The reporter inquired with diplomatic circles again yesterday morning and learned that the Norwegian consulates have not yet been able to handle the affairs they are acting on behalf of, such as consular visas and issuing passports. It is heard that the Soviet consulate in Shanghai has telegraphed the Soviet consulate in Harbin to inquire. According to a reply telegram from the Harbin side, it is still necessary to request instructions from Moscow. However, diplomatic circles believe that the question of when the Norwegian consulates will take over on behalf of the Soviet consulates is not important. What is important is the fact that the Soviet authorities have taken this measure. Therefore, it is generally believed that Soviet-Japanese relations may not be able to ease as a result of the recent signing of a ceasefire agreement.

### Shooting in a Brothel Japan Plans to Protest Claiming Shooters Were Guerrillas

According to *The China Press*, it was reported by the Japanese side last night (the 15th) that the Japanese consulate authorities plan to protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department regarding the shooting in a brothel on Saturday night that injured two Japanese people. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese consulate officials have completed the investigation of this crime and plan to accuse the Police Department in their protest of "still failing to effectively curb the activities of Chongqing elements." It is reported that the shooting occurred at a brothel at No. 26 Pingwang Road. According to the police report, several Chinese and Japanese people were drinking and having fun in the brothel at the time. Suddenly, a Chinese person entered and opened fire. Li Dingshi, the "Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Special City Government," escaped unharmed. Two Japanese "advisors" to the "City Government" were each shot and wounded. A Chinese director of a Chinese-Japanese joint venture automobile company jumped out of the second-floor window and was injured. One prostitute was killed and one was injured. Those injured include Kitasho Ketsu, 40 years old, who was shot in the abdomen from the left side; Ikeda Ketsuro, 41 years old, who was hit in the face with a gun butt; and Dong Ming, director of the Huazhong Urban Automobile Co., Ltd., who jumped from the building and injured his buttocks and left leg. Another Japanese advisor, Sasaki, Wang Changchun, a "Councillor of the City Government," and Li Dingshi, "Director of the Public Works Bureau," were unharmed. According to the witnesses, three or four assassins rushed into the room where the banquet was being held, shouting that they were guerrillas, and then fired eight shots. When the bullets jammed and could not be fired, they hit Ikeda in the face with the gun butt. After Kitasho was injured, he was taken to Fumin Hospital, and the bullet in his abdomen was removed by surgery on Saturday night and he is expected to recover in two months.

### American Government and Public Opinion Concerned About Far Eastern Events. Whether the Treaty Between the US and Far Eastern Nations is Renewed Largely Depends on the Outcome of the War in China. Remarks by the US High Commissioner to the Philippines Before Departing from Shanghai

Mr. Sayre, the newly appointed US High Commissioner to the Philippines, accompanied by his wife and two children, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Lines at 2:00 PM on the 15th. Mr. Gauss, the Consul General of this port, Admiral Hord, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and over 300 others, held a welcoming reception for Mr. Sayre at the Shanghai Race Club, located at Xieqiao on Jing'an Temple Road, at 6:00 PM that evening. As Mr. Sayre was about to take office, he did not wish to linger and hastily departed from Shanghai with his family on the original ship at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, heading to the Philippines to assume his new post via Hong Kong. During his voyage, Mr. Sayre briefly spoke to reporters about the general situation in the United States. The following is the transcript of his remarks:

The United States Hopes to Maintain Neutrality

Civilization depends on trade. Past great cultures have died because their commerce was suppressed. Trade between the United States and the Far East only has beneficial effects for those involved. When asked about the US's attitude towards the current situation in Europe, Mr. Sayre replied that the American people hope to maintain neutrality but are deeply concerned about preserving democracy. The American people do not want international chaos and rule the world with force. Whether the United States can remain neutral in the war is still unknown.

Many US-Japan Treaties are Outdated

Regarding the issue of the abrogation of the US-Japan commercial treaty, Mr. Sayre gave a brief reply, stating that many of the old clauses could not protect US interests. As the abrogation of the treaty would take a considerable amount of time, the Japanese government was notified that the United States had decided to replace the outdated clauses to make them suitable for modern use to adjust international trade and interests.

Equal Treatment for All Treaty Nations

About a year ago, the United States concluded excellent commercial treaties with Britain and France, as well as with Switzerland, Norway, and various Latin American countries. These commercial treaties are based on the principle of equal trade treatment and stipulate opposition to discriminatory trade barriers. This new system has already shown its results, namely increased trade and the protection of US exports to various countries. The most sincere approach is being taken to protect US interests and commercial treaties that benefit other countries, and every effort is being made to advance this.

Far East Shipping Should Be Maintained

When asked about the restrictions on American shipping stipulated in the Pittman Neutrality Act amendment currently under discussion in the Senate, Mr. Sayre declined to discuss the matter, except to say that he hoped that American shipping in the Far East could be maintained and not hindered. However, he expressed his firm view that the general trade of the United States needs to be maintained. On this point, Mr. Sayre pointed out that world civilization depends on trade, and he cited major trading nations that have been dominant in the past and present due to trade, and reviewed the decline of powerful nations due to the loss of their trade. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain trade between the United States and the Far East.

Far East Events

Of Utmost Concern

When asked whether Senator King's proposed amendment to the Pittman Bill would gain the approval of the Senate, Mr. Sayre did not comment on this. If Senator King's amendment is passed, it will repeal the proposed restrictions on American shipping to the Far East. Mr. Sayre continued to comment on the events in the Far East, stating that the American people are deeply concerned about China, and even with the outbreak of the European war, this concern has not diminished. Whether the commercial treaty between the United States and Far Eastern countries is renewed depends largely on the outcome of the war in China. If the war in China is not resolved, there will be no detailed discussion of the commercial treaty.

No Criticism of Philippine Issues

When asked about his views on Philippine affairs and the possibility of the United States continuing to hold sovereignty over the Philippines after the current independence bill is amended, Mr. Sayre did not give a definite answer but acknowledged that this issue is currently under study. He cannot make any comments at this time. When he does make a definite statement on Philippine affairs, it will be in Manila, not Shanghai. Among the many issues he will be paying attention to, one is the re-examination of the issue of Philippine independence. At this time, he has no specific plan to study this issue. He also declined to comment on reports that the Philippines hopes to gain independence while maintaining economic priority, like Cuba.

Mr. and Mrs. Sayre's Short Stay in Shanghai

According to reports, those who welcomed Mr. Sayre upon his arrival in Shanghai yesterday included Admiral Hord, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and Mr. Gauss, the US Consul General. After meeting with reporters, Mr. Sayre boarded Admiral Hord's barge to go ashore, and then toured the city with his wife. Mr. Gauss then hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Sayre at the Columbia Country Club. The reception was informal, and American expatriates in the city were invited to attend. About 300 people attended. Mr. Sayre was formerly the Assistant Secretary of State. He decided to bring his wife and two children to the Far East. Those traveling with him also included his legal advisor, Mr. and Mrs. Pell, administrative assistant, Mr. and Mrs. Wheelock, and private secretary, Miss Gray, and Miss Newcomb.

### College Students Commit Crimes; Extorting Classmates Leads to Arrest; Confession of Gang Membership and Intimidation Results in Court Order for Detention

Guo Jiarong (21 years old), Chao Weizu (19 years old), both from Changzhou, and Lu Xiaofeng (19 years old), a local, and Yan Wenkuai (19 years old), from Ningbo, all students at a certain university, frequently frequented dance halls, causing the money provided by their parents to be insufficient for their expenses. Guo Jiarong, together with Zhu Zhaogen, a local student currently studying at the Kader Road Chinese Vocational School, had

Previously Been Classmates

Zhu came from a well-to-do family. Therefore, Guo Jiarong colluded with Lu Xiaofeng, Chao Weizu, Yan Wenkuai, and others to summon Zhu Zhaogen from his home at 77 Pan Sheng Road in the French Concession on the 12th of this month. While strolling and chatting on the road, Guo Jiarong claimed that a former classmate named Zhang Yong had been arrested by the Japanese for participating in guerrilla activities. Lu Xiaofeng spoke in Japanese and dressed like a Japanese person. Yan Wenkuai

Played the Role of Translator

claiming that the Japanese person (referring to Lu Xiaofeng) worked for the Japanese army. According to the claim, after Zhang Yong was arrested, his confession implicated Zhu Zhaogen as an accomplice. The Japanese were now also seeking to arrest Zhu Zhaogen. At the time, Guo Jiarong expressed shock and asked Zhu Zhaogen how he would deal with it. Zhu also felt deeply uneasy. Yan Wenkuai and others then said that they should ask this Japanese friend (referring to Lu Xiaofeng) for help to prevent the matter from escalating. Lu Xiaofeng continued to express his opinion in Japanese. Guo Jiarong and others said to Zhu Zhaogen,

This Matter is Not Small

At least 500 yuan is needed to settle the matter. Zhu begged bitterly at the time, and it was eventually decided that 320 yuan would settle the case. However, Zhu did not have such a large sum of money at the time and only gave Guo Jiarong and others 30 yuan. The rest was agreed to be paid in full on the evening of the 15th of this month. Guo Jiarong and others took the 30 yuan and spent 10 yuan on a meal, leaving 20 yuan to be divided, with each receiving 5 yuan. After Zhu Zhaogen made the payment, he reported it to his parents,

Who Then Realized He Had Been Deceived

They reported the information to the French Concession Police Station and requested an investigation. Upon receiving the report, the French police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to wait at the agreed-upon time for the remaining payment to be made. As expected, Guo Jiarong and the other three arrived on time to collect the money and were arrested together by the detectives and taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, Detective Xu Jinlong and others escorted them to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Zhang Minsheng

Took the Stand for Interrogation

The defendant Guo Jiarong confessed that on the 12th of this month, his classmate Yan Wenkuai came to borrow money. The defendant did not have any money at the time. Later, they went to visit their classmate Zhu Zhaogen together. It happened that a friend, Lu Xiaofeng, looked like a Japanese person, and did not know Zhu Zhaogen. Moreover, they knew that Zhang Yong was Zhu's good friend and had been arrested. Therefore, the defendants temporarily came up with the idea of borrowing money from their classmate Zhu Zhaogen.

It Was Not Premeditated

Lu Xiaofeng confessed, "I only said a few words in Japanese, I didn't take care of other work." Yan Wenkuai, Chao Weizu, and others also confessed to participating in extortion and fraud. The court briefly questioned the plaintiff, and then ordered that the defendants be detained, and rescheduled the hearing for October 25th.

Garden Owner Kidnapped

Ransom Demanded

Chen A'dong, a local resident of Chenjiazhai on Baisezhong Road, Haig Road, in the French Concession, went to plant trees in the garden of Linjia Lane on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai around 8:00 AM on September 28th. He was suddenly kidnapped by more than ten bandits and has been held for half a month.

### Bizarre Murder Occurs in Hongqiao Town, Western Shanghai; Female Homeowner Shot and Killed After Midnight Knock; Perpetrator Flees; Motive for Assassination Unknown

Wang Jiying, a 30-year-old local woman from Xinqiao Village, the westernmost part of Hongqiao Town, western Shanghai, had never married and lived with a 10-year-old adopted daughter and her father, Mr. Wang, in Shanghai. Her father ran a carriage business, which was doing well. After August 13th, Mr. Wang became ill and disabled. Jiying took over her father's business, but she was naturally romantic and not good at managing it, leading to its decline and eventual closure. A few months ago, feeling that it was difficult to live in Shanghai, she thought that life in the countryside would be easier to maintain. She immediately moved back to her old home in Hongqiao. Suspicious figures often entered and exited her door. At midnight the day before yesterday, a very urgent knock was suddenly heard. Jiying immediately ordered her adopted daughter, who was lying in the next room, to open the door. She saw a stranger who seemed familiar. The man told the girl to go back to her room. Then,

He Arrived at Jiying's Bedroom

The girl heard the two talking in very low voices in the next room, which were not very clear. She only felt a murmuring sound. About an hour later, the two seemed to walk out of the bedroom. Suddenly, a loud bang was heard. The girl rushed to see Jiying lying in a pool of blood, unconscious and barely breathing. The man was already gone. Neighbors rushed over upon hearing the news and placed her on the bed. She had already died. They saw that she was only wearing a cheongsam, and her lower garments were missing. They felt surprised. Why was she assassinated? It was difficult to understand at the time. There was no news. The family of Chen is extremely worried and concerned. However, due to the remote environment, there is no way to rescue him. Suddenly, yesterday, they received a letter from the bandits, claiming that the hostage is currently ill, but not seriously. They are being treated by a doctor. They also said that if 200,000 yuan can be used for ransom, the hostage will be safely returned, etc. According to Chen's neighbors, Chen has four brothers, all of whom are engaged in gardening. They are usually hardworking, simple, and frugal, so they have some savings. However, Chen only received a quarter of it.

### Fake Diamond Ring Discovered; Owner Hu Shanqing Arrested; Confession Indicates Exchange by Pawnshop

Hu Shanqing (34 years old), a native of Ningbo who worked as a chief steward on French warships, currently resides at No. 2 Hongyuli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street. On the first of this month, due to urgent need, he took a diamond ring that he had purchased in Saigon, French Indochina, to Hengde Pawnshop at No. 277 Aidoa Road for

Pawning

He received 500 yuan in national currency. Afterwards, the store discovered that the diamond ring was fake, but there was nothing they could do. The day before yesterday afternoon, Hu went to Baili Jewelry Store at No. 252 North Hai Road, which specializes in redeeming pawned items for customers, intending to sell the pawn ticket

for a Price of 400 Yuan

to the store. The store owner, Chuan Bingyang, said that the price could only be determined after redeeming the item and assessing the quality of the diamond ring. Hu agreed and

Left the Pawn Ticket

with Chuan. Chuan then prepared the funds and took the ticket to Hengde Pawnshop to redeem the item. He was stopped by the pawnshop clerk, Pan Huasheng, who withheld the redemption money of 514 yuan and 10 cents, and took Chuan to the police station, revealing the truth. The police then dispatched officers to arrest Hu at his address and confiscated another pawn ticket, also for a diamond ring, pawned at Yuantong Pawnshop on West Zilaihuo Street for 200 yuan. The officer then went to the pawnshop to investigate and learned that the diamond ring was also a

Fake Pawn

He took them all to the police station for questioning. The police chief did not detain Hu because he had a legitimate occupation. Yesterday, Hu was transferred to the Second Special District Court and prosecuted for fraud under Article 339. Judge Qiu of the Eighth Criminal Court interrogated him. The defendant, Hu Shanqing, confessed that the diamond ring was indeed purchased by himself in France. However, the diamond ring currently produced was not his, but had been

Exchanged

by the pawnshop. The other ring was purchased from a friend named Li Maohe for 300 yuan. Li was also present in court today and could prove it. Li Maohe was then interrogated, and he confessed that the diamond ring pawned at Yuantong Pawnshop was indeed sold to Hu by himself. After reviewing the situation, the court decided to reschedule the hearing for the 23rd of this month. The defendant was released on bail with a 600 yuan surety from the store.

Chinese Compradors on Yangtze River Steamers

Completely Withdrawn

According to sources from Hankou, after the bombing by Chinese air force ten days ago, the situation became tense. Residents evacuated to safe areas, fearing that tanks would soon approach after the air raids. In addition to stepping up defenses, the Japanese army also paid attention to defending all kinds of temporary "local organizations" there. Important new dignitaries rarely go to the organs to handle affairs. The shipping route from Shanghai to Hankou is now dominated by the Japanese "Toa Kaiun Kabushiki Kaisha." Because Japanese ships fear being attacked by Chinese aircraft, all Chinese compradores have been completely withdrawn (Chinese compradores originally traveled back and forth between Shanghai and Hankou with the ships). Passengers are also greatly reduced due to fear of accidents en route. Because there is no war risk insurance, there are even fewer reported shipments. Both passenger and freight business have plummeted.

At the Intersection of Bazilu Road

Japanese Erect Boundary Markers

Yesterday morning, the Japanese army nailed a wooden sign reading "British and Japanese Defensive Area Boundary Line" on the wall of Delong Straw Company at the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazilu Road. It was found that the Japanese had already erected a boundary line marker next to the electric pole at the south entrance of Bazilu Road. Now, it is being re-erected. The intention is truly puzzling. Japanese soldiers stationed at the intersection of Bazilu Road and Fusheng Road have been withdrawn. However, two armed Japanese soldiers patrol North Jiangxi Road from south to north, carrying guns on their shoulders.

Female Jin Xiaomei

Sentenced for Using Counterfeit Money

Jin Xiaomei, a woman from Jiangyin, was instigated by Ah Ming, who is still at large, to carry three one-yuan counterfeit banknotes and fifteen double-corner notes from the Central Bank and use them at 107 Guangdong Road. She was discovered by Shu Pinfang, a noodle stall vendor, who reported it to the Chinese police and took her to the police station. Based on her confession, the police went to the home of Ah Ming, who is still at large, at No. 68 Jialu Road and confiscated 53 one-yuan counterfeit banknotes. Yesterday morning, she was brought to the First Criminal Court and prosecuted for using counterfeit national currency. Judge Feng De presided over the hearing and sentenced Jin Xiaomei to three years of imprisonment for attempted use of counterfeit money, and confiscated the evidence.

### Local News

### Poetry and Overcoming Nature - Reading Notes - Shuang Chang

Human evolution is due to labor, and culture only arises after labor. "Aiyo Hangyo" was originally shouted out because the work was too hard; the sound is simple, but from this, things like poetry are produced. Long ago, that labor cry evolved into simple poetry. When I hum "The Song of Striking the Earth", I can imagine people living in nature at that time, working freely only for the needs of life.

The society of Yao and Shun changed. By the time of "The Song of Auspicious Clouds", the clan social organization gradually became complete, production tools were improved, and the way of life also progressed, and further resisted nature. Yu and others controlled the waters, "cutting wood along the mountains, opening up the nine rivers, and reaching the four seas", creating a human miracle. And "Futaomo" is a kind of labor cry that encourages each other up and down. However, although humans initially conquered nature at that time, they still had not escaped its shackles. The "Song of the Emperor's War" shows the concept of nature.

The relationship between humans and nature had a great influence on the development of poetry later. After Yu, the rise of the production economy brought about the collection economy, and this relationship was further strengthened. Humans discovered the mystery of nature in planting and believed that there was a hidden god in charge of everything. After work, they produced a kind of flattering act of worshiping gods (together with flattering the rulers). This is the same as the four-stringed lyre poems performed in the ancient Greek games. Later, the "Nine Songs" attributed to Qu Yuan in Chu Ci was originally a sacrificial song similar to that time, but it still could not avoid mystery. The hymn of the Book of Songs "Ode" is ostensibly said to be for one's own familiar ancestors, but it is still a kind of tabooing role of Confucius who did not understand the way of nature, so he shunned singing about natural monsters and gods.

Undoubtedly, some poetry still has not gotten rid of these kinds of factors up to now, which has made it easier for evil forces to take advantage, although it originally started from the cry of labor. As the times develop, the attitude towards nature has gradually changed, but there are also differences in quality and quantity. The cry of "When will the sun perish, I will die with you!" is ultimately too little. In the process, many let "I don't know which direction the wind is blowing!" fill it up. Human resentment has many manifestations in history: "The red sun is scorching like fire, and half of the rice seedlings in the fields are withered" all the way to "The oppressed raise their fists together", they want to resist nature and overcome evil forces. And this road is arduous.

Quite a few poets have mentioned overcoming evil forces; what about nature? Many people have failed to go alone. The singer of the times, Gorky, gave an example in "The Theme of Poetry":

...But you, forget the gods,

Builder who swallows the feet of the oppressor,

You have to choose...ants or citizens?

You are fused together, ants and citizens,

Then the working masses,

...we learn from nature,

While learning, we teach nature.

Gorky believes that although this poem is very clumsy, it still shows that the poet has the most valuable concept of a revolutionary philosopher, but humans are not only learning and teaching nature, but also more bravely making the power of the elements of nature follow the power of our reason and will, we leap to become the masters of nature, creating our own "second nature".

Nature should also be overcome!

When we understand poetry with this point of view, we can understand history; and we can have a more correct and strict evaluation of a certain traditional simple worship and praise of nature.

(Addendum: Some of the ancient poems cited in the article are suspected of being forged in their times, but their "ancient" seems quite credible, so they are discussed.)

### Gold Prospectors on the Banks of the Dulu River Zhu Zhang

The leaves of the Chinese flowering crabapple tree snag the sunset over the Dulu River, leaning askew on the uneven mountain path, facing the desolate sound of the west wind. From the wilderness of Luobei, several sounds of rumbling donkey carts float.

The river flows from a screen of overlapping winds, the yellow sand beneath gently undulating. Every morning, before the mist has fully dissipated, many companions come to the river, heads bowed, silently searching for their livelihood, until night when they return with their birch bark containers full.

Another dawn arrives, a gust of wind sweeping over the white stone tents, awakening the river, ruffling its light紗-like skirts. A group of lively children rush over with their bags, kissing the surface of the river, dipping their hands into its embrace. At times, it will stuff a handful of sandy substance containing dreamlike riches into the hands of the children, who leap for joy, even tears flowing, thanking the river.

"Little bastard without a father, get out!" Suddenly a child with tears streaming down their face retreats gradually from the river under this stern threat. The river's fragrance entirely covers the body of a child with angry eyes.

A red-clothed girl slowly approaches with a woman whose face is full of sorrow, walking to the side of the sobbing child, raising a thin hand with a purple strip of cloth, she says wearily, "Child, who is bullying you again!"

The child's sobs intensify into loud wails: "He scolds... my mother," the child throws themselves into the woman's embrace.

"Little bastard without a father, widow without a husband, get out!" The fierce child from before shouts again loudly.

"Alas, a child without a father?" The woman looks towards the sun covered by thick clouds, letting out two bean-sized tears, questioning a sentence.

The whirring sound of panning sand continues to echo around, no one looked up a few times and made a sound—she felt that the truth was indeed too pitiful.

"Child—" The woman wipes away her tears, placing the crying boy and girl a little behind her.

"One generation's grudge will be encountered for a hundred generations." —Autumn

### Hope Pinpin

What is hope like? An inn on a journey, an oasis in the desert, or a lighthouse in the vast sea? I cannot say, but I know that there is always such a thing as hope in the world—you probably know the story of Pandora.

What is annoying is, where is Pandora's box hidden? Pain, disaster, failure, disease, escaped and spread among people, everyone can see it (maybe they will come to see you, suddenly). Hope, fortunately, did not escape, locked in the box, why can't this box be found? Where exactly did Pandora hide it in a secret place!

People are sad because they can't find hope, and even curse it:

What is hope? It's a prostitute:

She confuses everyone, offering everything to all;

Waiting for you to sacrifice a great deal of shells—

Your youth—she will abandon you.

—Petofi Sandor

Don't be like this, good people! Just imagine: If hope is really scolded away, what will we become? Losing the inn, we will drift aimlessly to the end; the oasis dries up, we will wither and die; without a lighthouse, we will grope blindly like a blind man. Hope gives me refuge, comfort, light. People hope to fly, develop: People hope to eat, grow bigger. Relying on hope, we progress, we survive. If the whole natural world had no hope, the sun would not want to rise again after it sets, the flowers and plants would not want to be reborn after they wither, and nature would die.

Laziness is the enemy of hope, diligence is the friend of hope. Laziness does not want hope (maybe there are some dreams, but dreams are not hope), hope does not go to him. Diligence wants hope, he uses strength to find it—breaking through the ground, leveling the boulders—so in the sweat, under the blood, hope meets him.

We don't have to be disappointed, there is only one hope today, hope for the victory of the motherland, the dawn has already appeared, reach out and take it, but you must first sweat and bleed! Go, hope is coming, go meet it!

, said to the children who were still grumbling, "Their father is indeed gone, gone for seven or eight years, their father died in the gums of one side of the master of this field, yes, he died so tragically; but your father—is still alive? Children with fathers are happy, oh, is a father who works for our enemies happier than an unfortunate father?" The woman's voice rose, and even made the surrounding sounds of panning for sand stop. —

"Alas, poor children without fathers. But our children, how many of you really have fathers? Children, tell me,"

Dozens and hundreds of lines of hot tears rolled out from the corners of her eyes—these were hundreds of eyes full of scars, "..." Even she cried, cried excitedly. The fierce child's face became even redder, and his shoes were also wet.

"That's right, you are all children without fathers and only useless mothers, but do you want your fathers? Do you like your kind fathers?! Alas, children, your fathers will not come back. But, when you grow up, you will know father... Father is always present in your smart brains! ..."

"Yes, father? Children without fathers—" A series of fierce roars seemed to melt the opposite white snow.

An armed yellow-clad soldier rushed over with a gun: "What are you stirring up?"

At this time, one hand after another gradually lowered, the climax subsided, only to see sandbags floating on the sparkling quicksand.

"Oh, children, do you miss your fathers," the yellow-clad soldier said when the air was quiet, "When you finish your work, finish reading your books, go to see your fathers, be good. Oh! Old woman, don't hinder work, so they can see their fathers earlier... Haha... Hehe... Haha,"

The children walked away with tears in their eyes, slowly leaving the embrace of the river, they went far away to receive ten copper coins of reward. A child calmly walked back after a while, standing blankly by the river. He seemed to be cursing. "Touch..." A series of shining discs in the sunset suddenly fell on the river: "Finding a father doesn't need these stinky copper coins,—"

On the dusky Dulu River, all the colliding birch bark containers were gone, the river violently sent a huge wave: Crash crash crash...

Tomorrow, under the sun, a yellow-clad soldier will be leaning next to the river. Anxious. The river slightly let out a bitter cry!

"Thank you to our Dulu River for waking us up, we will never pan your quicksand again, goodbye!" The yellow-clad soldier seemed to hear a children's song, he could no longer relive the old dream of prosperity.

(Note) The Dulu River is located in the southwest of Luobei in Heilongjiang Province and produces gold sand.

The Arts

### The Process of Adapting "Love Sea Doubts" Yu Ling

This play is adapted from John Galsworthy's "The Show". I wrote it hastily, I suffer from having little time to sit at my desk and flip through dictionaries, I owe the convenience of Mr. Fang Guang-pu's translation, and even borrowed a lot from it, which should be stated, and thanked. - Mr. Fang's translation is named "A Fuss", which is an English-Chinese translation version published by Kaiming.

The original play is in three acts, the first act being a rain scene. In the current Chinese stage, changing scenes is difficult, so I simply changed it to a four-act play. The adaptation was for the "Shanghai Drama Society" to use for an experimental public performance on a Sunday morning at the "Xinguang Theatre" this spring. Due to the limitations of performance time and stage equipment, I cancelled the first scene of the second act of the original play - the newspaper office scene. Now the "Shanghai Drama Society" will use it as one of the repertoire in long-term public performances. After re-reading the mimeographed version of the second act, I specially added it for publication to make it complete.

The reason for changing the content is entirely for the performance of "this time and this place", hoping to contact and relate to "that" thing more possibly. I hope that insightful John Galsworthy researchers will forgive me!

Regarding him, there have been many early introductions in China. This spring, the "Shanghai Drama Society" also performed his "First and Last". Regarding "The Show", Mr. Fang has already given a detailed explanation in the preface of "A Fuss", so I will omit it here.

The above is the postscript when this script was titled "Full City Storm" for publication.

Now the "Shanghai Drama Society" has adapted it into "Love Sea Doubts", after "Wu Zetian", and publicly performed it at the "Huangong Theatre". Speaking of the title, this is indeed a matter that has been carefully considered. Mr. Fang once wanted to change it to "Barking at Shadows", "Quarreling", "Sao Yuan", "Selling Savage Heads", "XXXX's Suicide Case", etc., and finally translated it as "A Fuss". At the beginning of the adaptation, based on the meaning of making a fuss all over the city, I changed it to "Full City Storm". After the "Shanghai Drama Society" failed to perform it for some reason, it was changed to "The Light at the End of the Tunnel" in the preview, meaning that the case in the play was constantly making a fuss, and finally the truth was revealed, like another village after the light at the end of the tunnel. Because the plot of "Another Village" at the end of the third act could not be approved, it was necessary to change the killing back to suicide. So the title of the third section was changed to "Love Sea Doubts". As the name suggests, this performance seems to focus on detective activities. Thinking of this, I once again feel the "lead-like mood". For the theater activities at this time and place, for the great Galsworthy of the original author!

### Films Without Male Stars Jingyuan

Since there has been cinema, there has only been one film starring entirely female stars, that is, MGM's recently completed "The Women". This film is a collaboration of 130 Hollywood female stars, led by Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine. The director is the famous George Cukor. The feature of the whole film is that there is not a single male character, only the background of a man appears in the last shot.

### Hotels Talk About the Infinite Emotion of the World's Changes - A Generation of Martial Artist Yang Ruiting Tianma

- Thirty Years of Opera Career Vanishes

Thirty years ago, the Changhua Wusheng in the Peking Opera world, Yang Xiaolou of Beijing, Shang Heyu of Tianjin, were once famous. At that time, among the rising Phoenixes, Li Jirui and Yang Ruiting were also well-known artists.

However, over the past thirty years, the opera career has vanished his youth like flowing water, the dead are dead, the old are old, and even the sparkling generation of Yang Ruiting is already an old man with white hair and childlike face in his fifties. Recently, Ruiting came to Shanghai from Tianjin, and the reporter met him at the city building. His spirit still retains the robustness of the past. He laughed heartily.

"The huge Yongan Company on the seventeenth floor, more than ten years ago, was exactly my old place where I performed vigorously in Shanghai!"

He seemed overwhelmed by the vicissitudes of life and told me that it was the original site of Tianchan, and the "Hongzhong" hostel today was the former "Yiwuting". According to confidants, Yang Ruiting's reputation was truly invincible at that time. His famous plays such as "Iron Bow Mountain", "Changban Slope", "Taking Gordon", "Zinan Prefecture", etc., can be called the best of ancient and modern times, and they are still in the minds of opera fans today!

Before August 13th, Yang Ruiting once performed on the Golden Stage, performing as an old man with both literary and martial talents. His reputation and his skills were naturally a sensation. However, in the past few years, due to the war in Shanghai, he went north to Tianjin. This time, he came to Shanghai at the invitation of the New Stage to unite with the Tan School old man and Xun Huisheng. Wang Qingli, who has been paired together in Yi, also came to Shanghai.

### The First Buddhist Film "Guan Shi Yin" on the Silver Screen Wuliang

Recently, Yihua Company has also devoted all its efforts to prepare for the shooting of a Buddhist epic "Guan Shi Yin". Three or four years ago, when Mr. Wang Yiting was still alive, he repeatedly told the owner of Yihua that there were many Western films that promoted religion, but Chinese films had not yet made contributions to Buddhism, and proposed that "Guan Shi Yin" be made into a film, which would make a great contribution to the Buddhist community. Because China has a large illiterate population, although Buddhism is popular in rural areas, they all know what it is but do not know why it is. However, they do not know that Buddhist studies contain extremely profound spiritual consciousness, such as "Guan Shi Yin". In terms of Taoism, Buddhists have six harmonies and five virtues, not just cultivating Taoism. Therefore, Yihua should treat the shooting of this film with extreme caution and strict attitude, and it is heard that it will hire famous people with great accomplishments in Buddhist studies to study together, hoping to dissect the true meaning of Buddhism and give Chinese people a deep understanding of Buddhism.

### Wang Yurong Comes to Shanghai First Weiwei

Jin Zhongren, Zhu Binxian, Sun Futing, Guan Shengxi Come Together

The new golden corners Wang Yurong and An Shuyuan will take the stage in early next month. Except for An Shuyuan who has already come to Shanghai, Wang Yurong will take the next Shengjing round to the south. Those who come with Wang also include supporting roles Jin Zhongren, Zhu Binxian, Guan Shengxi, Qiu Shengrong, and Sun Futing.

Guan Shengxi and Qiu Shengrong have not been away from Shanghai for long, and Shanghainese already have a good understanding of these two. Jin Zhongren has not been to Shanghai for a long time. This time, Yurong is coming south because the young man in this play must be Zhongren. Zhongren then came with Wang. Zhongren's Xiaosheng, in today's capital opera circle, is called the "Three Old Xiaosheng" together with Cheng Yanqiu and Jiang Miaoxiang. His art has reached the pinnacle of perfection. He has a unique understanding of Fangjin opera. An Gongzi of Thirteen Sisters can be called a unique figure, a solid typical figure. Zhu Binxian sat in Binqing Society. He came to Shanghai with Li Wanchun, but the impression he left on Shanghainese was not deep. Binxian is good at performing funny clown operas. Although he has a slight problem with his tongue, he can resonate in the hall. There are many talented clowns in recent years, but there are not many who can resonate in the hall. Binxian has made a lot of progress in recent years. After Ma Fulu left Qingsheng Society, Xun Huisheng regarded him as his right-hand man. Sun Futing is an expert in old dan roles and has been with Mei Lanfang and Xun Huisheng for a long time. He once came to Shanghai with Cheng Yanqiu last year. Jin, Zhu, and Sun are all members of Huisheng's team. This time, Jin and others came to Shanghai with Wang Yurong, which has a great impact on Huisheng's performances. However, Huisheng also has an agreement with Golden and will take over after Wang Yurong. Therefore, Huisheng resolutely agreed to let Jin and others come south. It is expected that Jin and others will not return north temporarily after the performance. After Huisheng comes to Shanghai, they will take the stage together again.

Wu Yanheng, the martial artist who is currently performing at Golden, is also Yurong's old partner. Since Yurong is coming to Shanghai, the Golden authorities are retaining Wu. In addition, whether Qiu Shengrong will come to Shanghai is still a question. Golden has agreed with Yuan Shihai, and Wu and Yuan have been scheduled to perform in succession.

As for whether the old actor Wang Yaoqing will come with Yurong, it is still questionable. Yaoqing does have the intention to come south, but I am afraid that all parties will ask for guest performances. Today's Yaoqing is no longer willing to perform on stage. The Golden authorities also very much hope that Yaoqing can come and declare that they will never insist on inviting guest performances. Zhao Tongshan (Furong Cao) has sent a letter to Yaoqing on behalf of Golden's performance. If there is any definite news, I will inform the readers again.

Offstage Anecdotes

### Member of the Board, Beile, Candidate for Taoist

I have said before that as long as those who make a living by performing opera can create their own childhood name (which the northerners call milk name) and nickname and make it famous, they don't have to worry about not becoming popular. At the same time, those in Beijing who are old hands at appreciating opera are particularly happy to hide the real names of famous actors and mention their childhood names and nicknames to show that they know the actors' family history. For example, if someone says "Yu Shiqin's Thirteen Sisters" is good, he will definitely continue to say: "Zhuang Er's play is simply unparalleled;" If someone says: "Yu Jusheng's Changban Slope is very experienced;" He then continued: "Of course, this is Mao Bao's signature play." In addition, there are those who like to pretend to be old-timers, but they are only children themselves. Whenever they talk about Lanfang and Shuyan, they always say Xiao Mei and Xiao Yu, which can be summed up in one sentence, which is what those people in Beijing who advocate feudal ideology like to put on the air of "Bailing". "Putting on airs" means praising one's own status and putting on airs, which is the meaning of "showing off" in Shanghai dialect.

In the past, it was popular in society to shout childhood names and nicknames, so the actors not only did not regard this as a shame, but also felt that it was a glorious and decent thing. When Sun Zuochen was alive, one day he took a red business card to pay me a New Year's visit. I saw three large characters "Sun Guangtong" printed on it, with two small characters "Zuochen" next to it. I was very surprised and asked him: "The name Sun Guangtong is very rare." He replied happily: "Isn't it, according to my own opinion, it is better to print my nickname "Lao Yuan" on the business card, then the whole country will know it, so as not to cause people to guess." He did have a serious face when he said this, and he was very proud. From this, it can be seen how they value their childhood names that have been shouted by the society. Later, there was a gentleman who insisted on changing the "Lao" character in Lao Yuan into the character "Lai" to show off his knowledge, which was really a ridiculous joke. At the same time, those who are good at drawing snuff bottles are also reluctant to give their names to others casually. (120)
