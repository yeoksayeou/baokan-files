### Full-Scale Counteroffensive by Chinese Forces in Northern Hunan; Remaining Japanese Troops at Yingtien Annihilated; Repeated Japanese Attempts to Land Near Hsiangyin Thwarted; Nearly 10,000 Japanese Soldiers Killed in Action in One Week

The Japanese troops who advanced south from Milo along both land and water routes in northern Hunan suffered a severe blow on the 23rd after being met with a fierce counterattack by Chinese forces. That evening, the Chinese forces launched a full-scale counteroffensive, and after a fierce battle throughout the night, the remaining Japanese troops hiding along the banks of the Yingtien River were completely wiped out. Another unit of Japanese troops attempting to cross the Hsinchiang River to harass Linchieh on the Hsinchiang River were also repeatedly attacked by Chinese forces and annihilated on the south bank of the Hsinchiang River. In total, the Japanese casualties in Yingtien, Hsinchiang, and Yanglinchieh exceeded 2,000 that night. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese forces, again using over 20 aircraft to cover more than 60 speedboats, emerged from Tungting Lake and attempted to invade the branching ports and rivers, launching another attack on Chinese-held Yingtien. At the same time, the Japanese troops north of the Hsinchiang River also launched a coordinated infantry and artillery assault to the south. As of noon, battles were raging on all fronts.

Milo - From Luchiachiao, Huchihpin, and Chiunmatsui west of Hsinchiang River's south bank to Jungchiawan, Hsinchiang and from Hsinchiang's east to Yanglinchieh, along with Yingtien north of Hsiangyin, Chinese and Japanese forces have been engaged in day-long battles on the 24th, with the fighting continuing fiercely into the night. Japanese troops attempting to forcefully land at Luchiachiao, Chiunmatsui, and make unauthorized crossings of the Hsinchiang River have been repelled by the Chinese forces. However, numerous attempts to forcefully land and make unauthorized crossings continue. At times, the Chinese forces also crossed the river to pursue the Japanese, resulting in an extremely complex and confusing situation in the area. In the Yingtien area, Chinese and Japanese forces have fought back and forth seven or eight times. Although a small number of Japanese troops managed to invade eastward from Yingtien by nightfall, they were repelled by the Chinese forces. According to captured prisoners, the Japanese forces mobilized a force of 60,000 men with the aim of invading Changsha. Their strategy remains the same as when they attacked Nanchang: an enveloping maneuver. The only difference is that previously they used tanks and cavalry to form mobile units for this task, but now they are using speedboats carrying only three days of provisions. However, this strategy has clearly been thwarted by the fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese forces in Yingtien for two days. Looking at the overall situation, since the Chinese forces in northern Hunan began their major offensive on the 18th, they have been fighting for over a week, and under all circumstances, the officers and men have held a determination to die, with no one retreating without orders. Even if only one soldier remained, he would fight to the death. With this spirit of heroic sacrifice, they have been able to eliminate nearly 10,000 Japanese soldiers in one week, creating a glorious record in the Tungting Lake campaign. Although the Japanese are reinforcing from the south and appear to be planning another attack, the morale of the Chinese forces is high and they are fighting with increasing vigor, ensuring the complete defeat of the invading Japanese troops.

Chungking – According to Chinese sources, fierce fighting is taking place on both sides of Tungting Lake. Yesterday morning, Japanese naval, land, and air forces launched a joint offensive against the Chinese positions in northern Hunan. It is reported that the Japanese are attempting to invade Changsha. While the Japanese army was attacking the Chinese positions north of the Hsinchiang River, another unit of Japanese troops, under the cover of warships and aircraft, attempted to outflank the Chinese forces on the left through Tungting Lake. It is reported that one unit of Japanese soldiers, divided into 200 speedboats and escorted by 30 warships, planned to land on the south bank of the Hsinchiang River. Another unit, divided into 100 speedboats, landed at Yingtien. Yingtien is located north of Hsiangyin, between the front lines of the Chinese forces and Changsha. It is observed that the Japanese are focused on pressing the Chinese forces on the east bank of Tungting Lake with an encircling action. Thirteen Japanese aircraft bombed Chinese positions in Yingtien and Hsiangyin throughout the day. At the same time, multiple Japanese aircraft extensively bombed northwestern Hunan Province, with 17 bombing Hochen and 20 bombing Hsiangyin. Six aircraft were reconnaissance over Changsha, Hsiangtan and other places observing the movements of Chinese forces. The Chinese forces fought bravely at all points. It is reported that the fighting on the east bank of Tungting Lake is the most intense. At Luchiachiao on the east bank of Hsinchiang River, and Chuma Village on the south bank, the Japanese attempted to land more than ten times yesterday. The fierce fighting yesterday resulted in over 3,000 Japanese casualties, and the intensity of the battle is unprecedented since the battles of Hsuchow and Hankow. Last night, the Chinese forces repelled the Japanese at all points. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)

Chungking - According to sources here today, the Japanese offensive in northern Hunan aims to capture Changsha. The fighting reached its peak yesterday. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft extensively bombed the rivers and mountains on the southeastern shore of Tungting Lake. The fighting on both sides was extremely fierce, and the Japanese suffered as many as 3,000 casualties. The Japanese advances have been severely checked by the defending forces. At the same time, in order to coordinate with the advance of ground troops, Japanese aircraft extensively bombed over 30 Chinese cities and towns in the above-mentioned areas. It was reported here yesterday that Japanese small warships and speedboat crews were busy landing on the east bank of Tungting Lake yesterday.

The commander of the Japanese Yamamura Haruo Brigade was seriously wounded, and some reports indicate that he has died. (Dispatch of the 24th)

Changsha - Japanese troops in northern Hunan have repeatedly failed to cross the Hsinchiang River, so they are now using speedboats to exit Tungting Lake and attack Yingtien north of Hsiangyin, hoping to coordinate with their land forces advancing south to threaten the flanks of Hsinchiang. When the Japanese troops forcibly attempted to land in Yingtien, they used air cover and also launched poison gas bombs. The Chinese forces resisted the poison gas and, after a day of fierce fighting, finally defeated the Japanese troops, sinking over 20 of their speedboats. By the evening of the 23rd, the Japanese forces were exhausted, and the remaining speedboats retreated in disarray. There were also more than ten attempts to forcibly land at Luchiachiao and Chiunmatsui, but by the evening of the 23rd, they had all been completely repelled by the Chinese forces. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese armies on the main front of Hsinchiang have formed a standoff across the river. (Dispatch of the 23rd)

### The "Provisional Government" of North China Issues a Statement

Peiping - The members of the "Provisional Government" of North China do not support the new "Central Government" to be organized under the leadership of Wang Ching-wei. This attitude can be seen from the public announcement they issued yesterday. Wang Ke-min originally intended to meet with reporters yesterday afternoon to report on the proceedings of the Nanjing meeting, but did not attend. The public announcement issued in the name of all members of the "Provisional Government" stated, "We are deeply moved by Mr. Wang Ching-wei's peace statement. We lack capable people, so we only organized a 'Provisional Government.' Although we lack intelligent people, we cannot be mere figureheads and sit idly by. We did not choose an administrative head, so that we could leave the position vacant for capable people. We express our gratitude for Mr. Wang's statement, because Mr. Wang praised the things that 'members of this government' have done in the past. We are ashamed to accept Mr. Wang's praise. If the things we have done in the past are related to national affairs and the people's livelihood, then we still hope to continue our original aspirations to the end. At this time of national crisis and the people's misery, it is not the time for us to talk about party factions. We are content if peace can be achieved. Therefore, we have sincerely expressed our views as above." Local Chinese believe that this public announcement expresses opposition to Wang Ching-wei's advocacy of Kuomintang ideology and mocks the Japanese for using the "Wang Ching-wei government" to control the country. It is recalled that Wang Ke-min often made anti-Wang remarks when he previously hosted news reporters (Associated Press dispatch of the 24th).

Editorial: Japan's Readjustment of the Status Quo with the United States

Following the signing of the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union to cease hostilities, Japan has recently devoted its full efforts to the United States. This is a clear sign.

From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese side had a kind of delusion, thinking that it had not only defeated China, but also defeated the world. The delusion was so extreme that it bordered on madness. In the international arena, they were arrogant; in China, they disregarded the rights and interests of other countries as if they were nothing. It was not until the bombing of the U.S. warship Panay that they regained some of their reason and knew that they should still be cautious and have some scruples, so they showed their gentleness to the United States. After some time, seeing that the United States had never spoken harshly, they were even more disrespectful and insulting, even ignoring the U.S. note of last New Year's Eve, thinking that it would pass with the years; and when the United States announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty in late July of this year, it was like being struck with a head-on blow, and they were in agony and anxiety, unable to think of any plan. With the rapid changes in the world situation, although Japan waved the anti-communist banner of Germany and fraternized with the Soviet Union, the cabinet was changed for it, and the progress and retreat were hesitant, but before long, the European war broke out, and Britain and France went to war one after another. "The intentions and actions of the United States and the Soviet Union are increasingly influencing the Far East." Therefore, they are eager to adjust the status quo with the Soviet Union and the United States. Their previous agreement with the Soviet Union and their recent moves toward the United States are all for the Far East; in other words, they are all intended to deal with China. Yesterday, the German Haitong News Agency's Tokyo dispatch stated that Japan's diplomatic policy is mainly to end the Sino-Japanese dispute, which is insightful.

However, what will be the possible realm of the readjustment of the status quo that Japan obtains with the United States and the Soviet Union? In terms of the Soviet Union, the two countries signed an agreement to cease hostilities, and the Soviet Union appointed an ambassador to Japan. The Japanese were pleased with these two events, thinking that they had achieved a great harvest, but in fact, they only returned from "abnormal" to "normal." The Japanese side's expectations for what they call adjustments between Japan and the Soviet Union are probably not limited to this, but it is also credible that Japan does not dare to have any extravagant hopes for the Soviet Union. The most extravagant thing they hope for is that the Soviet Union will no longer trade with China; in this regard, it is credible from all aspects that the Soviet Union will never be bound by this treaty. Therefore, the adjustment of the status quo between Japan and the Soviet Union has nothing to do with their attempt to deal with China.

In terms of Japan's so-called adjustment with the United States, they are starting with the replacement of the foreign minister. The candidate for foreign minister is Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura of the Navy. Nomura had studied at the U.S. Naval Academy and had served as the naval attaché at the Japanese Embassy in the United States. At the Washington Conference, Nomura was one of the Japanese representatives. Because of this background, he is familiar with many people in the U.S. government and public, and the Japanese regard him as a "U.S. expert." The ties of diplomatic relations to the talent of the foreign minister often have their subtle effects. Therefore, both the Japanese government and the public have high expectations for Nomura's entry into the cabinet. However, examining the current state of U.S.-Japan relations, the crux of the matter lies in the fundamental contradiction of national policies; that is, the United States is committed to maintaining the civilized principles of mankind, maintaining the principles of international justice, and maintaining the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, while Japan is using force to destroy what the United States wants to maintain. The contradiction transcends diplomacy and enters the realm of politics. How can this be eliminated by the talent of the foreign minister? It is absolutely impossible to change a foreign country's traditional national policy with the talent of the foreign minister, so how can Nomura adjust it?

Adjusting the status quo between the United States and Japan requires Japan to abandon its aggression; otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. Judging from the fact that Japanese leaders do not correct their own actions but only blame the foreign minister, it can be seen that Japanese leaders have failed to understand the crux of the problem. Suma Yakichiro, the former counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, returned to Japan a few days ago and frankly told reporters that the U.S. sentiment toward Japan is much worse than what is understood in Japan. He also said that the U.S. Navy has an extremely bad feeling toward Japan. He also said that the China incident has stimulated U.S. women, thus greatly influencing public opinion. Why is all this so? In fact, it reveals the hidden truth, is it not aggression! Suma knows this, but the Japanese authorities do not know it. Is it necessary for someone of high rank and prestige, such as Admiral Nomura, to enter the cabinet before Tokyo is prompted to reflect? The U.S.-Japan trade treaty will expire next January; and next year's large-scale exercise by the U.S. Pacific Fleet will be advanced in particular, that is, it will be held in January. These two things do not necessarily have a causal relationship, but they can be a reference for those who do not know how to reflect. The United States has never spoken harshly, but those who are good at reflecting should not wait for harsh words.

### General Bialorussia Arrives on the Western Front; German Forces Begin Counteroffensive; Fierce Fighting on the East Bank of the Saar River; French Positions Remain Unmoved

Paris - The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 40, stating, "On today's front lines, there has only been localized artillery fire, with minor skirmishes between outpost infantry units in certain areas." (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

Paris - According to information received here, the German forces on the Western Front have resumed activity following the arrival of their commander, General Bialorussia, initiating several localized battles along the entire front, particularly in the region between the Saar and Rhine rivers. German patrols are launching more frequent attacks than before, and their artillery is also attacking French positions with greater intensity. At one point, the Germans launched a formal assault, previously deploying in small squads, but this time using a large force in a surging attack, displaying considerable bravery. However, they were completely unsuccessful before reaching the French defenses, as the German forces were immediately hindered by heavy French artillery and machine gun fire, preventing any advance. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Paris - The French High Command declares that German forces on the Western Front launched a fierce counteroffensive against French troops last night. Following the German High Command in Berlin's declaration that "the war in Poland is over," German forces began their counteroffensive against France. French officers claim that fighting on the east bank of the Saar River is intense, with French forces repelling three German assault teams. Both French and German forces continue to bombard enemy positions with powerful long-range artillery. It is widely believed that the German offensive is a welcome gesture for General Bialorussia's arrival on the Western Front from Poland. French machine guns and artillery repelled three German assaults against French positions near the Saarbrücken forest area. German assault teams engaged French forces with hand grenades and bayonets. It is reported that German heavy artillery is bombarding the French Maginot Line, French positions, and roads. French officers claim that fighting is occurring between the Saar and Zweibrücken, where French forces have made progress, an area deemed extremely important by the Germans. French forces have advanced into the German Western Front defenses near Zweibrücken. The French High Command declares that the French Air Force was extremely active yesterday, scouting German movements on the front lines. It is reported that German forces continue to concentrate in two areas: across from Belgium in Alsace-Lorraine and across from Switzerland in the Black Forest. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

Paris - Renowned journalist Maurice recently commented on the situation on the Western Front in the Petit Parisien newspaper, stating, "Since the 22nd of this month, our main defensive line has been extended eastward by over seventy kilometers, including the town of Hombach and the area northwest of Lauterbourg. There has been heavy artillery fire along the entire front on the evenings of the 22nd and 23rd, particularly north of the Lauter River and near the city of Weissenburg. In addition, the enemy has launched repeated and fierce attacks in the Saar, Blies, and Horn River valleys, with the ground fighting becoming more intense than before. Our outpost positions in these areas, using several small forests as cover, have been gradually advancing northward in recent days, with the main objectives being the cities of Saarbrücken and Zweibrücken. In the Zweibrücken area, our forces have advanced to a small forest (on the road from Sarreguemines to Zweibrücken). This location is strategically important, and the enemy is eager to retake it, having launched three counterattacks with two battalions or even a regiment, all of which were repelled by our forces using artillery and machine guns. Our positions remain unmoved." (Havas Agency dispatch, 24th)

Our forces are determined to defend the city of Warsaw and the Modlin area to the last breath." (Havas dispatch, 24th)

London - The German High Command has just stated that the Polish campaign is now complete and the Polish army has been destroyed. According to the German announcement, this is the third time this week, but the Germans still acknowledge that Polish forces are still holding positions in the Warsaw and Modlin areas. The Germans claim to have captured 450,000 Polish soldiers and seized or destroyed 800 Polish aircraft, with the rest having fled abroad. German troops who crossed the demarcation line in several places are now withdrawing to make way for Soviet troops. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin - The German Supreme Command announced this morning, "German forces are advancing along the demarcation line in the east according to the original plan. In recent days, the number of deserters fleeing from Praga and Modlin continues to increase. The German Navy continues to bombard Polish positions on the Hel Peninsula." (Haitong dispatch, 24th)

Berlin - An official communiqué from the German High Command stated, "After the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Poland, Polish troops, especially those operating in the Vistula River area, have suffered defeats. After the Germans implemented annihilative warfare, the fiercest battles occurred along the Vistula River, where over a hundred Polish soldiers were defeated, captured, killed, or wounded by German forces. No Polish active or reserve divisions or independent brigades escaped, with only a small number fleeing to the eastern Polish marshlands, where they were repelled by Soviet forces. Currently, only a small number of Polish troops continue to fight in Warsaw, Modlin, and Hel. German forces are delaying their attacks out of consideration for civilian lives." (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

Berlin - Air Minister General Göring inspected the German Air Force's First Group on the northern front of Warsaw yesterday. (Haitong, 24th)

### Siegfried Line: Unhygienic Conditions

Paris - German prisoners captured by French forces have described the poor conditions within the Siegfried Line, stating that the recent cool and humid weather has greatly affected the health of the garrison. Soldiers defending the Siegfried Line are stationed in concrete bunkers, but the bunkers are very small and lack adequate ventilation. If the iron doors are closed, the conditions inside become extremely uncomfortable. Some bunkers offer no room to maneuver other than to fire from within. If the fighting lasts too long and they cannot go outside, the soldiers have to sleep standing up. Outside temperatures easily penetrate the bunkers, and water often drips down the walls. Food must be brought in from outside, and when the lines of communication are threatened by artillery fire, the soldiers are forced to remain in the damp bunkers, lacking food, sleep, and adequate air.

### Duke of Windsor Arrives at the Front with the Army

Amsterdam - According to a dispatch from London received here, the Duke of Windsor has arrived at the French front with the expeditionary force, serving as a staff officer with the rank of Major General, and is currently stationed in an unidentified town under an assumed name.

### Reservists Continue to Enlist; Soviet Forces Advance Deep into Poland; The German-Soviet Border is Temporary in Nature; Fundamental Resolution of the Issue Will Take Time

Moscow - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has just issued an order stating, "Due to the extraordinary situation abroad, the mobilization of reservists in the Moscow, Kalinin, Belorussian, Kiev, Kharkov, and Orel military districts, as ordered on September 7, will continue pending further instructions. All workers and staff who have been drafted will be reinstated to their original positions upon completion of their military service." (TASS dispatch, 23rd)

Moscow - The General Staff of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army issued the following war report on September 23:

"On the morning of September 23, units of the Red Army began to advance to the line demarcated by the Soviet and German governments, occupying the towns of Stryj and Grodno, and advancing to a line west of the towns of Brest-Litovsk, Kovel, Volodymyr-Volynsky, and Lviv. On the same day, units of the Red Army continued their mopping-up operations in Western Belarus and Western Ukraine, clearing small units of Polish troops northwest of Grodno and northwest of the Brest-Litovsk fortress. Further reports indicate that on September 22, while the Red Army was clearing a unit of Polish troops southeast of Kovel, it captured over 8,000 officers and soldiers, seized 2,000 horses, and several trains loaded with military supplies." (TASS dispatch, 24th)

London - According to reports from Berlin, German Führer Adolf Hitler will visit the Western Front in the near future. Also, several Swedish military officers recently traveled to Moscow to discuss the demarcation of occupied territories in Poland and were originally scheduled to return home after the deliberations were concluded, but they remain in Moscow "continuing negotiations," indicating that the claim that the border between the two sides has already been demarcated is premature. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

Berlin - The Frankfurter Zeitung believes that the division of the occupied territories in Poland between German and Soviet forces is not a permanent border but rather a temporary one. When the Swedish army was ordered to enter the borderlands, there was no intention of extending the Swedish border as far east as possible. At the beginning of the German-Polish conflict, Führer Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to actively defend the German borders, and this task has been completed. The work currently being carried out relates to the national and political life of the Germans who were previously forced to live within Poland. It is currently difficult to predict how the eastern border will be defined. What can be determined is that safeguarding the new order in this region belongs to Germany and the Soviet Union. The determination of a permanent border must await an investigation into the ethnic and economic situation. The current border is merely for military convenience. The fact that the current border runs through the center of Warsaw proves that this is not a permanent, final border. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)

Riga - There is great attention paid to the border demarcation between Germany and the Soviet Union. The newspapers believe that the current demarcation can only temporarily resolve the Polish problem. The final border must be based on three principles: (1) military, (2) national, and (3) economic. Hitler, in his speech in Danzig, stated that there could no longer be an independent Poland. Therefore, Poland will temporarily be under German protection or German-Soviet co-management. A fundamental resolution of the issue will require a long time. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)

Moscow - Germany and the Soviet Union have demarcated a border within Poland. According to reliable sources, the border demarcation negotiations were initiated by Germany. The German Ambassador to the USSR, Schulenburg, recently asserted that even Brest-Litovsk should not be allowed to be occupied by the Soviet Union, let alone other places further west. However, the border that has now been agreed upon is 150 kilometers west of Brest-Litovsk, and the town of Praga, near Warsaw, has also been assigned to the Soviet Union. In other words, the Soviet Union has acquired more than half of Poland's territory at a very small price, including the oil region and industrial center of Eastern Galicia, with a population of nearly 20 million, representing a great victory. It is believed that Germany is eager to establish an understanding with the Soviet Union and therefore has to accept Soviet conditions. In addition, the border currently set by Germany and the Soviet Union has an immutable nature, and the idea of a buffer state is no longer mentioned. There is little doubt that the Soviet government will establish a Polish Soviet Republic in the purely Polish-populated area as part of the Soviet Federation. Diplomatic circles say that Germany launched the war because England and France refused to allow it to do as it pleased in Central and Eastern Europe. Now, to cope with the war on the Western Front, it has to allow the Soviet Union to control Central and Eastern Europe, from the Baltic coast to Slovakia and Romania. Soviet troops have now advanced to the heart of Central Europe, greatly consolidating the country's position and no longer worrying about a German invasion. In the future, it may impose a disguised protection system on the Baltic states and pressure Romania, thereby reclaiming Bessarabia, which Germany will be unable to prevent. In addition, the Soviet border is now close to Slovakia, where Slavs live, and it can further incite them and cause revolutionary movements in Central Europe. The Soviet Union is well-suited to do all of this, and it does not need to conclude a treaty of alliance with Germany unless it has even broader plans. At this moment, Soviet mobilization is still underway, but the number of troops transferred to the western frontier has decreased. Among foreigners in Moscow, the Japanese are still satisfied, saying that the Soviet Union will be busy dealing with European affairs and will have little time to attend to the Far East. (Havas dispatch, 23rd) Germany and the Soviet Union divide Poland and demarcate the border, from the East Prussian border, along the Pisa River, Narew River, Vistula River, San River, to the Carpathian Mountains. The land acquired by the Soviet Union accounts for almost two-thirds of the Polish territory, with a population of 11 million, even larger than the land lost in 1920, i.e., the so-called "Curzon Line" (shown as a dotted line in the figure). The oil fields of Galicia are mostly obtained by the Soviet Union. As for the land obtained by Germany, it accounts for only one-third of the Polish territory, but the population accounts for 20 million. At the same time, the coastline on the Baltic Sea has been extended to the Memel area. The coal mines of the Destes and Upper Silesia, the steel and textile industries of Lodz and Upper Silesia, and the farmland and forests of Bosnia are all owned by Germany.

### Estonian Foreign Minister Undertakes a Mission to the Soviet Union; The Issue of Fortifying Estonian Islands Will Definitely Be Discussed

Moscow - Estonian Foreign Minister Selter is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow morning. According to official sources, this visit is to discuss the extension of the existing commercial agreements between the two countries. However, foreign observers say that other issues, including the neutralization and disarmament of the Estonian islands in the southern part of the Gulf of Finland, will also be discussed. The Soviet government also intends to raise the issue of fortifying Äland Island. Äland Island, located in the Baltic Sea, can serve as a base for blockading the Gulf of Finland. Sweden and Finland established an agreement in January of this year to discuss fortification measures, and the signatory countries of the 1921 convention, namely England, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Denmark, agreed. The Soviet Union also wanted to participate in the matter, but it was deeply dissatisfied that Sweden and Finland did not consult with it in advance. Therefore, it expressed its opposition when the Council of the League of Nations discussed this agreement in May of this year, and the Council of the League of Nations made no decision until now.

### General Fritsch Killed in Action; German Newspapers Publish Obituary; The Nature of His Position is Veiled in Secrecy

Berlin - The official announcement of the death of former German Army Commander-in-Chief General Fritsch was officially released yesterday, stating that he had been killed in action on the Polish front on the 22nd of this month. However, the inside story of this matter remains mysterious and inexplicable. Also, the "General Report" recently published a mysterious obituary on the matter, with the signature of the current Commander-in-Chief Bialorussia at the end. The obituary stated that General Fritsch "was killed in action while carrying out an emergency inspection," and that his position was only the commander of the 12th Artillery Regiment. As for the circumstances of his death, they were not clearly announced. It is incomprehensible why Fritsch, as an artillery officer, would have to carry out emergency inspections. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

### German Submarine Sinks Finnish Merchant Ship; No Hope of Rescue for the Crew of the Wangjie; The British Navy Has Sunk Seven German Submarines

Bergen, Norway - The Finnish steamer "Mathilda Thorden," loaded with a batch of celluloid, set sail from the port of Kemi in Finland and, at 11:20 last night, was intercepted by a German submarine 15 miles off the coast of Arendal, Norway. The submarine ordered the 23 crew members to abandon ship, and then sank the ship. The crew members arrived in Arendal this morning in two small boats. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

Lisbon - Rear Admiral Gothner, commander of the US Mediterranean Fleet, arrived here last night aboard his flagship "Trenton." En route, he received a distress signal from the British ship "Constance," which was being pursued by a German submarine near Cape Finisterre. Rear Admiral Gothner immediately dispatched the "Jacob Jones" to assist, supplying the British ship with fresh water and other supplies. A German submarine was spotted at the time, but it fled upon seeing the "Jacob Jones." (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

London - According to a statement from the Information Ministry, Germany's outrageous use of submarines in violation of treaties has led to the continued loss of British merchant seamen. There is now no hope of rescue for the crew of the British ship Wangjie (4,853 tons). The Wangjie sent a distress signal 300 miles west of Ouessant, France, stating that it had been shelled by a German submarine and was sinking, and that the crew had abandoned ship as instructed. Two Danish and Norwegian ships received this telegram on September 6 and searched the Wangjie's location, but found no trace of it. British ships were also unable to find any survivors. At the time, it was still hoped that the crew had been rescued by fishing boats or ships without radios, but nearly three weeks have passed with no news, and it is feared that this hope has faded, and the crew of the Wangjie have been sacrificed because of Germany's violation of treaties by engaging in submarine warfare. Article 4 of the London Naval Treaty signed by Germany in November 1936 clearly stipulates that warships or submarines may not sink merchant ships until the crew of the merchant ships have been placed in a safe place. Uncovered lifeboats cannot be considered a safe place unless the weather is calm and land is nearby or ships are coming to help. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

London - Since the start of the war, the British Navy has sunk a total of seven German submarines. Naval experts, after hearing the news, requested that the Information Ministry issue an article pointing out that German submarines are very vulnerable to attack due to the lack of a strong fleet to support them. It said that submarines of all countries are easily sunk by torpedo boats or merchant escorts when traveling on the surface, and can also be attacked with depth charges when traveling underwater. If these depth charges explode near a submarine, they are enough to destroy the hull and sink it. Even if the explosion is farther away, the force of the shock is enough to destroy the submarine's generator and various machinery, extinguishing its lights and forcing the submarine to surface, where it can then be shelled and sunk. In addition to torpedo boats and escorts, there are also aircraft that can fly down quickly and bomb the submarine before it has time to enter the sea, and use machine guns to strafe the officers and soldiers on deck. Killing just one person can prevent the air vent from being closed, and if the submarine still manages to enter the sea, it will sink. Moreover, machine gun bullets can sometimes penetrate the hull, preventing the submarine from resurfacing. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

### British Seizure of Contraband Complies with International Law

London - The Information Ministry has just issued a communiqué stating that German propaganda agencies have recently issued news claiming that the United States Navy's actions in cutting off Germany's overseas cargo sources are in violation of international law. However, although neutral countries have the right to trade with Germany, Britain is entitled to seize various contraband items being transported to Germany in accordance with international law. In other words, as long as the rights of belligerents exist, Britain will enjoy the right to seize contraband. After all, no belligerent country will allow the enemy to purchase various goods to continue the war without interference. In short, in addition to exercising the rights of belligerents, Britain has no intention of interfering in the economic relations between neutral countries and Germany, and does not want to restrict the freedom of neutral countries to trade. On the contrary, Britain is still prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the needs of neutral countries for supplies for their own use. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

### Two Submarines Discovered in the Gulf of Mexico; Nationality Unknown

Mexico City - Last night, two submarines of unknown nationality were discovered for the second time in the Gulf of Mexico, located just outside the three-mile territorial sea line of Veracruz state. The first discovery was outside the port of Veracruz, and the second was outside Puerto Mexico, which is the only outlet for the Tehuantepec Isthmus, a major oil-producing area.

### Italian Prime Minister's Declaration: Wishing to Preserve Peace and Prevent Expansion of the War's Scope

Rome - Yesterday, Mussolini delivered a speech at the Palazzo Venezia to leaders of the Fascist Party in Bologna province, stating that the end of the European war had arrived. This was Mussolini's first public speech since May. He stated, "The Polish problem has been completely resolved. The European war has not actually begun. The armies have not yet formally made contact. If all parties can understand the futility of maintaining or reforming this historical mistake—the Treaty of Versailles—then this decisive war can be avoided. Italy will not change its initial intention and will continue to strictly adhere to the neutrality resolution passed by the Cabinet on September 1." Mussolini also ordered the leaders to severely crack down on rumor-mongers. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)

Berlin - According to the "People's Observer," Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, after inspecting Piedmont this spring, delivered a speech in Genoa, declaring that he would remain silent until there was an important decision to make, at which point he would speak. After mentioning this, the newspaper claimed that Mussolini's decision to deliver a speech today, despite not yet having reached a decision, was based on two reasons: First, to indicate that Italy is not staying out of international affairs but is closely monitoring the situation, ready to act at any time; and second, to declare that if the Western European powers accept Mussolini's speech, peace can be achieved. (October 24, Huitong dispatch)

Rome - The renowned journalist Gaeda, often referred to as the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, recently published an article in the "Italian Daily," stating, "At this time of unrest in Europe, Prime Minister Mussolini has determined an attitude for our country, ensuring that Italy occupies an important position in today's Europe. In short, our country should strive to safeguard the collective interests of the European continent on the one hand, and protect its own vital interests on the other. This attitude was clearly explained at yesterday's Cabinet meeting. From an international standpoint, this attitude is not only in accordance with the various agreements that our country and other countries have signed, but also suits the common desire of all nations to not expand the current war. From a national standpoint, it can also safeguard the country's concrete interests and is welcome by the people. However, this attitude is not passive but active, and its goal is to preserve peace. In other words, while meticulously safeguarding the legitimate interests of its nation, Italy also hopes that other nations can feel their shared responsibility towards Europe. However, since Italy has decided to pursue this policy, it must closely monitor the evolution of the situation." (October 23, Havas dispatch)

Paris - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech has been commented on by diplomatic circles here, stating that Prime Minister Mussolini has reiterated Italy's desire to remain neutral and has voiced support for Germany, arguing that once Germany's goals have been achieved, the war can end. (October 24, Havas dispatch)

Geneva - According to sources here, French political figures have expressed disappointment with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's brief and appropriate statement on the current political situation. They are surprised that the Italian Prime Minister's declaration did not offer any peace proposals. Regarding the Italian Prime Minister's statement that the Western countries had not yet engaged in war with Germany after the end of the Polish war, Parisian figures refuted it. French political figures are puzzled as to why the British and French authorities did not take the same action of declaring war on Germany after the Soviet Union invaded Poland. Parisian public opinion generally believes that the Italian Prime Minister's declaration is of no benefit to the European situation. (October 24, Huitong dispatch)

Washington - Political circles here expressed support last night for Mussolini's pursuit of peace, but they believe it is too late. The peace appeals of Italy, the United States, and other countries cannot save this war that has already erupted. In this war, the Polish problem has indeed become a minor issue. The main point is the contact between Britain, France, and Germany. The disintegration of Poland has little to do with the current development of the European situation.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Drafts Neutrality Act Amendment; Majority of Senators Support the President's Proposal

(Washington) - Judging from the recent public opinion in the Senate regarding the issue of neutrality, there are 35 senators who oppose the repeal of the arms embargo. The remaining 61 senators mostly support President Roosevelt. However, there are still 10 to 15 senators who have not yet decided which side to support. Those who support the President are confident that they will win in the end, but they expect that it will take a month or six weeks of intense debate and campaigning to defeat the isolationists. (October 23, Reuters dispatch)

(New York) - Landon, the Republican presidential candidate in 1936, visited Roosevelt yesterday to ask if he would participate in a third presidential election. "Scripps-Howard" newspaper reporter Simms interviewed Landon afterward, who said that President Roosevelt should issue a clear statement that he will not participate in a third election, and that he will not accept even if the Democratic Party nominates him as a candidate, as the greatest contribution the president can make under the current difficult and chaotic situation. Landon also said that he does not oppose President Roosevelt's Neutrality Act proposal if this bill can keep the United States out of war. However, if Roosevelt participates in a third election and causes the Democratic and Republican parties to abandon party politics, it would be unfair. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)

(Washington) - US Senator Pittman convened the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday for a so-called "tail-end" meeting to draft a bill to amend the Neutrality Act. The content is roughly the same as the President's proposal. Therefore, the debate over the Neutrality Act has begun, and the senators who support the amendment are gathering to discuss ways to abolish the arms embargo clause. Democratic Senator Clark, who has always opposed abolishing the embargo, is now confident that he is also among those "invited" to participate in the "tail-end" meeting. Clark is a well-known isolationist senator, and Pittman will hesitate if he insists on participating in the future. According to government sources, the "tail-end" meeting will draft a bill this week so that it can be submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee for discussion as soon as possible. According to statistics from the Associated Press, the opinions of senators on the amendment of the Neutrality Act are close to the government's. The following table shows a rough overview: Democratic Party, Republican Party, Other, Support Amendment, 45, 5, 1, Oppose Amendment, 10, 12, 3, Uncertain, 20. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)

(Hyde Park) - President Roosevelt again refused to comment on the issue of his participation in a third election last night. He also did not want to express any opinion on Landon's remarks before seeing the full text. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)

(Washington) - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet on the 25th of this month to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment issue. Committee Chairman Pittman recently invited 14 Democratic Party members to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment he plans to propose. The content includes: (1) Abolishing the arms embargo clause; (2) Implementing "cash and carry" terms for all goods shipped to belligerent countries; (3) Prohibiting American ships from transporting goods to belligerents, with severe penalties for violators. This is stricter than the measures Pittman proposed in the previous session of Congress. It is generally said here that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has a total of 23 members, and Pittman has already invited 14, so there is little doubt that he will obtain a majority of votes in favor. In addition, Democratic Committee member Clark, who has always opposed the abolition of the arms embargo clause, was not invited to attend today. (October 23, Havas dispatch)

(Hyde Park, USA) - The New York World reported yesterday that a key Republican figure, namely Landon, the candidate in the last election, had suggested to President Roosevelt that he announce his intention not to run in the next year's election, and that Landon meant that the Republican and Democratic parties should eliminate their differences, but only on the condition that President Roosevelt does not run again. When the President arrived in this city today, a reporter asked him about this news, but the President refused to comment. (October 23, Havas dispatch)

(New York) - Republican and isolationist figures have recently launched a nationwide committee to oppose President Roosevelt's proposal to repeal the arms embargo clause. Key Republican figure, former President Hoover, recently instructed his secretary to issue a statement to the press, stating that he does not intend to join this committee and wishes to maintain freedom of action. (October 23, Havas dispatch)

### Britain Willing to Respect Norwegian Neutrality, on Condition that Germany Does the Same

### Pan-American Conference Opens; Panama President Delivers Opening Address

(Panama City) - The Pan-American Conference opened here at 5 p.m. today. Representatives from all 21 republics of the Americas attended. The President of Panama, Arosemena, delivered the opening address, followed by the election of four committees: (1) Legal and Political Committee; (2) Economic Committee; (3) Neutrality Issues Committee; (4) Credentials Committee. It was also decided to convene a plenary session on the 25th of this month, with Panama's Foreign Minister Garay designated as chairman. According to well-informed sources here, the conference is scheduled to close on the 30th of this month. The following is a summary of President Arosemena's speech:

The President first stated that the Pan-American Conference, when held in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1936 and in Lima, Peru in 1938, stipulated that if a war occurred outside the Americas and threatened the peace of the Western Hemisphere, the American countries should immediately consult with each other. The convening of this conference is based on this stipulation. It is regrettable that less than a year has passed since the last conference in Lima, Peru, and this stipulation has been put into practice due to force of circumstances. At this time, what the American countries should show to the world is not only geographical unity, but also spiritual consistency. Various moral values have gradually disappeared, and Western civilization is declining daily. The responsibility for reversing this trend and preserving these values and this civilization for humanity should be borne by the American countries. Even if some American countries have adopted dictatorship, none has adopted imperialism or totalitarianism. No nation on the American continent is willing to follow a leader in adventurous actions to expand power or conquer mankind. This can be stated with certainty. (October 23, Havas dispatch)

(Mexico City) - According to reliable sources, during the last European war, Germany opened a port in the Gulf of Mexico, near the port of Nautla in Veracruz province, which has now been rebuilt to serve as a submarine rendezvous center. Although Mexican authorities have denied this, unidentified submarines have indeed been found in the Gulf of Mexico. Shipping companies in Veracruz province have had to take various precautionary measures, painting the name of Mexico on both sides of all ships to avoid being mistaken. In addition, several private radio stations have been set up within Mexico to report various news to Germany. Mexican authorities have begun searching for them. (October 23, Havas dispatch)

### German Side Announces Strategy for Invading Poland

(Berlin) - The High Command of the German Armed Forces issued the following statement last night: "The Polish war is over. The most intense battle was the battle on the Vistula River bank, defeating 1 million Polish troops, the majority of whom were captured. Only a few scattered units escaped to the eastern frontier. The entire Polish army now has only a few remnants stubbornly resisting in Warsaw, Modlin, and the Hel Peninsula. The reason they are able to do so is entirely because Germany wants to avoid unnecessary sacrifices for the Polish people. In the spring of this year, Germany, in view of Poland's attitude and its increasing reliance on foreign guarantees, which created a tendency to resolve German-Polish relations by force, studied Poland's intentions from its military measures and newspaper articles, and reached the following conclusions:

(1) Polish Strategy: Polish senior generals underestimated the strength of the German army, believing that Poland could take advantage of Germany's two-front war and launch a partial attack against it. Their planned strategy was to occupy Danzig and encircle East Prussia from three sides. Therefore, the troops were deployed as follows: A. Northern Route: North of Warsaw, its mission was to prevent the German army in East Prussia from moving south, while also advancing to attack it. B. Western Route: The Corridor troops, cooperating with the Northern Route to attack East Prussia and seize Danzig, and gathering a large army in Posen to provide support. C. Southern Route Defense Line: The Krakow-Lviv area. Polish senior generals believed that the troops in this area were sufficient to protect the industrial zone and could even invade the industrial area of Upper Silesia.

(2) German Strategy: The purpose of the German operational plan was to encircle a large number of Polish troops on the Vistula River bank and annihilate them there. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, General Brauchitsch, and the Chief of the General Staff, General Halder, decided to form northern and southern army groups. The Southern Army Group was commanded by General Rundstedt, with Lieutenant General Manstein as Chief of Staff. The Northern Army Group was commanded by General Bock, with General Salmuth as Chief of Staff. The Southern Army Group consisted of three armies: First Army Commander List, Second Army Commander Reichenau, and Third Army Commander Blaskowitz. The Northern Army Group consisted of two armies: Army Commanders Kluge and Küchler. The Southern Army Group's task was to advance towards the Vistula. General List led the First Army to push eastward from Upper Silesia. The Second Army, Reichenau, moved northeast. The Third Army, Blaskowitz, advanced from east of Breslau to besiege Warsaw, completing a large encirclement. The Northern Army Group was ordered to quickly establish contact with East Prussia and move south to support the Southern Army Group. The war unfolded gradually according to the original plan. A large-scale annihilation battle took place on the Vistula River bank, resulting in the capture of 450,000 prisoners, 1,200 artillery pieces, and countless other munitions."

### Romanian New Cabinet is Only Transitional; Continued Purge of Iron Guard Members

(Bucharest) - After the assassination of former Prime Minister Calinescu, the King has appointed General Argeseanu as Prime Minister. Political figures here have declared that the Argeseanu cabinet is only transitional, and a new cabinet will soon be formed by key political figures. (October 23, Havas dispatch)

(Bucharest, Romania) - The Romanian government authorities continued to purge members of the fascist Iron Guard yesterday in retaliation for the assassination of former Prime Minister Calinescu. It was previously reported that a total of 2,300 members had been killed, but it is now known that this was an exaggeration. However, at least 340 people were shot or "killed while trying to escape." Many people were arrested in various places yesterday, and the concentration camps are overcrowded. The Romanian government authorities have vaguely indicated that they intend to punish the families of the assassins. According to a statement last night, the Romanian Minister of the Interior has received countless letters questioning why the government has not punished the families of the assassins, but the statement did not mention future retaliation measures. According to the semi-official "Romanian Newspaper," "It is one of the government's duties to arrest troublemakers." (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)

(Bucharest) - At 9 a.m. this morning, the state funeral of the late Prime Minister Calinescu was held here, with tens of thousands of people participating. Current Prime Minister Argesanu represented the government, former Prime Minister Urdareanu represented the House of Representatives, Senate President Anghelescu represented the Senate, and former Cabinet member Văcărescu represented the National Front. Five speeches were delivered by people's representatives to commemorate and praise Calinescu. (October 24, Huitong dispatch)

### Arms Issue: Supreme Defense Council Discussed Yesterday

(London) - The British and French Supreme Defense Committee held a joint meeting in Britain yesterday, mainly discussing the adjustment of arms manufacturing industries on both sides. This is because the weapons needed by the French army are sufficient for domestic production, but assistance from Britain is needed to supply future allies. Diplomatic figures here said that although Poland has been defeated, Britain and France are still considering how to attract other countries to conclude alliance treaties with them in order to contain Germany in the east. However, as long as the current U.S. Neutrality Act is not amended, the allied countries can only purchase weapons from Britain and France. This is why the Supreme Defense Committee held a joint meeting yesterday to discuss this issue. (October 23, Havas Agency dispatch)

### Franco-Japanese Relations

(Paris) - Political and diplomatic figures here are all pleased that Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada has been appointed as the ambassador to France, saying that the decision to fill the vacancy of the Japanese ambassador in a short period of time under the current international situation is of great significance. Once Ambassador Sawada arrives here to take office, various issues related to the two countries can be discussed in a good environment, thereby establishing closer relations. In addition, Ambassador Sawada served as a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in France for many years, is known for being pro-French, speaks French fluently, and is familiar with world affairs, so he is well-suited for the job.

### Singapore: Japanese Fishing Rights Granted Extension by British

(Tokyo) - According to Japanese sources here, the Singapore authorities in charge of fishing rights summoned all Japanese holders of fishing licenses yesterday, stating that all fishing licenses that are about to expire will be valid until the end of this year. It was also said that London and Tokyo have now agreed to extend the Japanese fishing licenses. This action by the British side will enable thousands of unemployed Japanese fishermen to regain "work". (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)

### Germany and the Soviet Union Implement Policies in Occupied Polish Territory; Different Words, Different Methods; Polish People Still Determined to Restore Their Country

(Paris) - A spokesman for the Polish Embassy in France told our reporter that the policies implemented by Germany and the Soviet Union in the occupied areas of Poland are completely different. The German method is to treat the Polish people as prisoners, using bayonets to force them to work. The Soviet Communists, on the other hand, have a completely opposite method. They first use communist propaganda on the Polish people to make them lean towards the Soviet Union. As for the Polish people, whether facing the German army or the Red Army, they all consider them invaders who have invaded Polish territory. To this day, they are still determined to drive these two enemies out of the country and restore their territory. And until now, the Polish troops between Warsaw and Modlin are still resisting the enemy's offensive. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)

(Stockholm) - Since the Soviet Union invaded Poland, communism has spread. The Swedish newspapers are all using extremely anxious tones to expose this crisis. The Stockholm Daily News stated, "Three-quarters of Polish territory is being Bolshevikized by the Soviet Union, and it intends to stay there for a long time. The National Socialist regime has always claimed to be a defense against communism, but now it has opened the floodgates, allowing the flood to inundate the European continent. What we are witnessing is the first step of the Soviet Union's westward advance. Germany has handed over most of the Polish territory it conquered to the Soviet Union, showing that it is willing to continue to make goodwill concessions to the Soviet Union. It should be known that the day Germany is fully engaged in the Western war will be the day the Soviet Union can act freely in Eastern Europe. The dream of Pan-Slavism will become a reality, and Germany will no longer be able to oppose it." The Swedish Daily stated, "We still remember that on March 15 of this year, when the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia became German protectorates, Führer Hitler said that the Soviet Union intended to establish air bases in Czechoslovakia, so he placed Czechoslovakia under German protection, thereby protecting all of Europe. How could it be that only half a year has passed, and the Soviet Union has been able to build air bases in areas adjacent to the German border? We do not know how Germany will explain this. Moreover, the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland is under the pretext of liberating Slavic compatriots. The 8 million Czechs and 12 million Poles who have been incorporated into Germany hate Germany even more than they hate the Soviet Union, so the torch of Pan-Slavism is about to start a prairie fire."

### Anti-German Movement in Czechoslovakia is Growing

(Paris) - The official Czech news agency here announced yesterday that the Czech people's uprisings in Bohemia and Moravia are continuing to grow. The situation in the Pilsen area is particularly fierce. Workers at the Škoda factory have disarmed the police there and released all anti-Nazis who had been arrested.

### Australia Decides to Send Troops to Europe to Aid the War

(London) - The Information Department issued a communiqué stating that the Australian Federal Government has decided to send an expeditionary force, including four squadrons of bombers, two squadrons of fighter jets, and pilots, to Europe to aid the war. The structure and size of the expeditionary force are still under consideration. In addition, the Federal Government has taken various measures in the army and navy to replenish its forces. In addition to the complete mobilization of the Navy, army reservists will be called up for enlistment, so that an additional brigade can be formed to defend the country or be sent abroad.

### Polish Government Prepares to Move to France; Soviets and Poles Detain Diplomats

(Brussels) - Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Szembek arrived in Paris yesterday. Szembek is the first high-ranking Polish government official to arrive in France. Political figures in Paris claimed that Szembek's arrival in France is to make arrangements so that the Polish government will soon move to France. (October 24, Huitong dispatch)

(Moscow) - According to well-informed sources, of the Soviet diplomats stationed in Poland, except for Ambassador Sharonov and the military attaché, who have arrived in Russia, the whereabouts of some other diplomats and consuls are unknown. The Soviet government has therefore decided not to allow Polish diplomats stationed in Russia to leave the country until the Polish diplomatic representatives and their families safely return to Russia.

### United States Actively Manufacturing Aircraft

(Los Angeles) - Although the current U.S. Neutrality Act does not allow the export of aircraft to belligerent countries, aircraft manufacturers here mostly believe that the current Neutrality Act will soon be amended. Therefore, aircraft factories are still processing and manufacturing aircraft. The aircraft hangars here are now full of new aircraft, so that when the Neutrality Act is amended, they can immediately provide for the needs of Britain and France. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)

### Problem with German Kerosene Supply

(London) A certain military correspondent claims that, according to aviation experts here, the German army lost over 400 aircraft in Poland. This was due to the poor quality of the aircraft and the inefficiency of the pilots. The Soviet Union's occupation of Polish oil fields and the cutting off of the Romanian border have led to speculation about Germany's oil resources. German experts estimate that Germany needs 16 to 18 million tons of oil annually during wartime, but Germany itself can only extract 3 million tons of oil from coal each year. The Soviet Union has a high domestic oil demand, so it is doubtful whether it can supply Germany with large quantities. Therefore, there are rumors that Germany is preparing to invade Hungary, aiming for Romania's annual oil production of 7 million tons as its ultimate goal. However, the Soviet Union can move into Slovakia as a countermeasure. (Reuters, 24th)

### Germany Restricts Food Purchases Again

The normal amount each person can purchase per week has been determined as follows: (1) Bread: 2 kilograms and 400 grams; (2) Meat: 500 grams; (3) Butter: 80 grams; (4) Butter substitutes: 120 grams; (5) Lard: 60 grams; (6) Cheese: 62 grams; (7) Jam: 100 grams; (8) Sugar: 250 grams. In addition, milk is only available for children. Potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and fish can be purchased freely. (Havas, 23rd)

### German-Belgian Trade Talks Proceed Smoothly

(Beijing) According to news from here today, the trade talks between Germany and Belgium are proceeding smoothly. It is reported that Germany has agreed to continue supplying Belgium with the necessary goods as it did before the outbreak of the European war. As for what Belgium will supply to Germany in the future, Belgium is hesitant because it strictly adheres to neutrality. The prices of Belgian steel products for domestic needs have not increased, but the prices of exports have greatly increased. (American Guan News, 24th)

### Death of Famous Austrian Psychologist Sigmund Freud

(London) Professor Sigmund Freud, the famous former Austrian psychologist, passed away last night at his residence in Hampstead due to illness, at the age of 83. Professor Freud was a leading figure in modern psychoanalysis and a former professor at the University of Vienna. He authored numerous works, many of which have been translated into various languages. His theory focuses on analyzing the human subconscious. Since the annexation of Austria by Germany last March, Freud, being Jewish, was not tolerated by the National Socialist Party, so he fled to England and settled in Hampstead, a suburb of London.

### A Comparative View of the Two European Wars by Chen Chuxiang

First, it must be stated that it has only been a little over twenty days since the outbreak of this European war. In this short period, Poland has collapsed, while the main forces of Britain, France, and Germany have just begun to engage. The Soviet Union's sudden entry into the war is also a major mystery. Trying to make a prophetic judgment on how it will change or what the outcome will be is simply self-deception. The purpose of this article is to briefly compare the brewing, outbreak, and initial military and diplomatic situation of the last European war with this European war. As for future developments, readers should speculate for themselves. History is recorded.

Everyone knows the cause of the last European war. It cannot be simply attributed to the assassination of the Crown Prince in Sarajevo. It should be traced back to the situation after the Franco-Prussian War. After France was defeated in 1870, its prestige plummeted. It was isolated due to the flexible diplomatic skills of Germany's Iron Chancellor Bismarck. At that time, Germany formed the Three Emperors League with Russia and Austria and the Triple Alliance with Austria and Italy. By revealing France's ambitions for Belgium and expressing Anglo-German friendship, Germany gained favor with Britain. As a result, Germany, while not dominating the European continent, certainly held an advantage. When Bismarck was forced to step down, Wilhelm II reversed his policies, causing Britain to be wary by competing in naval power and promoting the "Three B's" policy. He lost favor with Russia by helping Austria develop in the Balkans. Therefore, Britain, France, and Russia joined hands one after another, while Germany, apart from Austria, only had a nominally aligned Italy. Wilhelm was not alert to this and still wanted to fulfill his hegemonic ambitions. This conflicted with Britain's traditional policy of maintaining the balance of power in Europe, ultimately leading to the war. After the war, France, with the triumphant posture of a victorious nation, courted Belgium, Austria, the Little Entente, and the Baltic group to form its satellite groups. It also formed an alliance with Soviet Russia, completing the encirclement of Germany. On the surface, it seemed that France gradually had ambitions to dominate the European continent. In reality, France's goal focused only on passive defense because it was a victorious nation, a nation that "had," hoping to maintain the status quo. Its cooperation and mutual assistance with other countries were more about significance than manipulation, so it did not pose much of a threat to Britain. However, Britain still could not tolerate it. A distant example is opposing the French and Belgian occupation of the Ruhr. A recent example is condoning the rise of Hitler. Hitler's plan was written in "Mein Kampf." Britain was not unaware of it, but since Hitler came to power, rearming, militarizing the Rhineland, and annexing Austria, Britain always adopted an attitude of "keeping one eye open and one eye closed," at most issuing only a hollow protest. During the Sudetenland crisis in Czechoslovakia last autumn, the European situation became tense, with an atmosphere of "grass and trees all being soldiers." However, Chamberlain finally softened and personally flew to Germany to negotiate with Hitler. The Sudetenland merged with Germany. Soon after, the two issued a joint declaration, stating that disputes between the two countries would not be resolved by war. The "Non-Aggression Declaration" between France and Germany also followed. It was not until this spring, when all of Czechoslovakia fell, that the situation changed drastically. Chamberlain then keenly felt that Hitler's guarantees were untrustworthy and his ambitions insatiable. At that time, Lithuania was being threatened by Germany over the Memel issue, and Poland also had the possibility of invading Lithuania. In order to maintain its traditional policy of maintaining the balance of power on the European continent, Britain resolutely gave Poland a guarantee. At the same time, it also wanted to use the "Bear of the North Sea" (the Soviet Union) to deter Germany's eastern border. It sent a delegation to the Soviet Union with France to negotiate an alliance, but both sides were always suspicious of each other. As a result, after five months of negotiations, nothing was achieved. Instead, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact suddenly came into existence like a bolt from the blue. Hitler then believed that he could be absolutely assured of the eastern border. His ambitions towards Poland became increasingly apparent. He used the Danzig issue as a pretext to take military action. If Britain and France tolerated this, Central and Southeastern Europe would fall entirely into German hands. Then, Germany might join forces with Italy and launch an attack westward or make colonial demands. Britain and France would find it even more difficult to deal with. Therefore, they had no choice but to fulfill their guarantee to Poland. After the German army invaded Polish territory and refused to withdraw, they declared war on Germany one after another.

On the surface, this is the cause of this European war. However, the British had long questioned, "Is the city of Danzig worth going to war for?" To say that Britain and France are truly fighting to uphold international justice and suppress aggressive evil deeds is as ridiculous as believing that Hitler is fighting to liberate German expatriates in Danzig. If Britain and France wanted to uphold international justice, why didn't they "draw their swords" when Austria and Czechoslovakia were being divided up, but delayed until now? While Hitler violated his promises, Britain also failed to fulfill its promises every time. Leaving aside the distant past, in recent times, the borders of Czechoslovakia after the cession of the Sudetenland were guaranteed by them. Why did they sit idly by and watch Czechoslovakia fall? In comparison, Hitler's words when he condemned Britain after hearing the British declaration of war can explain the cause of this war. He said that Britain, being located outside the European continent, always focused on maintaining the balance of power on the European continent. This led to the Anglo-Spanish, Anglo-Dutch, Anglo-French, and Anglo-German wars in the past. However, his words only told half the story. He did not explicitly state that he was pursuing a hegemonic policy, which disrupted the balance of power in Europe and caused the war. What Britain fears most is a country promoting a hegemonic policy on the European continent. Under this situation, Britain has no choice but to embark on the path of driving him back.

### Tung Wah Association Wins First Match: 7-4 Victory over the Rangers, Leading 3-1 in the First Half, Wu Qixiang Active on the Forward Line

Yesterday, the weather was clear and the Yiyuan Stadium was lively again. Because of two good matches, no fewer than three thousand people came. Those who arrived early enjoyed the benefit of watching the first match for free. Tickets were not sold for the first match, and the gate was wide open. When the Tung Wah Association came on the field, the gate was closed, but it was impossible to ask those who had arrived early to leave. The Tung Wah Association, with the help of Wu Qixiang from Hong Kong, won the first match with a score of 7-4 against the Rangers, leading 3-1 in the first half.

Tung Wah Association:

Qin Bicao

Chen Hongguang Zhuang Youren

Shu Shigeng Cai Shengmiao Wang Cuixing

Wan Xianghua Yu Qiaxing Dai Linjing Wu Qixiang Jia Youliang

Rangers:

Hu Erfei

Xue Niqing Ke Xunaigu

Bao Si Simmons Ai Qigufu

Adige Meng Kecai Yinggelan Fafanxiao Kaipusiding

In the first half, the Rangers kicked off and attacked. After five minutes, Wu Qixiang passed the ball to the center, and Dai Linjing took advantage of the goalkeeper's save and lightly pushed the ball under his arm. Tung Wah took the lead. The offensive was very strong for a while. Yu Qiaxing and Dai had a wonderful collaboration, but Dai kicked the ball slightly high, and it flew over the crossbar. On one occasion, Youliang made a wonderful cross, but Xue Niqing rushed to clear it out of bounds. Although the opportunities were good, they did not materialize. Then, the offensive shifted to the other side. Kaipusiding crossed the ball, and the landing point was excellent. Qin Bicao punched it out, showing his skill. Fafanxiao hooked the ball from the bottom line, and Qin caught it steadily. After eighteen minutes, Ajia shot and scored, making it 1-0. Tung Wah still had many good opportunities. Dai made a shot from eighteen yards, and Yu Qiaxing made a close-range hook, but both were blocked by Simmons. After twenty-six minutes, the Rangers found an opportunity to shoot. Fafanxiao shot from ten yards and scored, making it 2-1. After thirty-two minutes, Wu Qixiang received a wonderful pass from Youliang and headed the ball into the net, making it 3-1. Tung Wah took the lead.

In the second half, after the break, both sides made major changes to their lineups, forming the following formations:

Tung Wah Association:

Qin Bicao

Zhuang Youren Hu Hanwen

Zhang Zhaopeng Cai Shengmiao Wu Qixiang

Wan Jin Wan Xianghua Dai Linjing Shen Shiyan Jia Youliang

Rangers:

Kaizi

Gelinbo Ke Xunaigu

Baotaisi Shibenting Qinen Siqi

Hu Er'en Meng Gucai Yinggelan Fafanxiao Kaipusiding

Tung Wah's momentum was still strong, but because the front line had been changed, the movements were unfamiliar. The Rangers were in a similar situation, so the situation was still controlled by Tung Wah. After seven minutes, Youliang passed to Dai, and Dai pushed the ball in. Shen Shiyan gently kicked it in, completing the goal, making it 4-1. Youliang was trying out new shoes for the first time this season. He usually wears rubber shoes when practicing, so he wasn't very natural. On one occasion, he had a good opportunity, but he shot the ball into the goalkeeper's arms. After thirteen minutes, Tung Wah's misfortune struck. Yinggelan rushed into the penalty area and kicked the ball. Qin Bicao didn't catch it steadily, and it slipped in, making it 4-1. Half a minute later, Yinggelan, the former Liu Lang, went deep again, passing the ball to the right wing. Kaipusiding added a kick, and the ball bounced in from the top post, making it 4-3. Tung Wah lost two goals in half a minute. Then, Hongguang was adjusted back into the game, and the defense line returned to its position in the first half. Hu Hanwen was made right midfielder, and Wu Qixiang was transferred to left midfielder. The situation improved again. After eighteen minutes, Wan Jin shot, but it was saved. Shen Shiyan rushed to kick it in, making it 5-3. After twenty-six minutes, Dai passed to Ajia, and Youliang passed back to Linjing. Linjing kicked with his left foot from sixteen yards, creating another miracle, making it 6-3. After thirty minutes, Hu Er'en cut in, and Hong first committed a foul. Simmons took the penalty kick and scored, making it 6-4. In the last minute, Dai received a pass from Shen and pulled a shot from close range, completing the match with a score of 7-4. Tung Wah won the victory.

The Shanghai National Arts Research and Discussion Society held a meeting at its clubhouse on Shanhai Pass Road yesterday afternoon, with free participation from all members. There were a total of eleven items on the program, among which Cha Mingsheng's single broadsword and Wang Zhengfang's Eight Immortals Fist were the most outstanding.

### Southwest Economic Construction

— Fang Peixing

The only way for China's economic construction to advance is through decades of effort.  However, the results have not been significant for two reasons.  First, before the establishment of the National Government, although there was construction, there was no planning.  Second, after the establishment of the National Government, although there was planning, it was limited by internal and external troubles, and progress was still insufficient.  With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the internal troubles have been alleviated, so in the past year or so, the government has been making unprecedented efforts in the economic construction of the whole country, especially the southwestern provinces.  In February, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang passed the "Production, Construction, and Control Plan for the Western Provinces." Later, our highest authorities also pointed out: "The western provinces are the source of our country's resistance," and explained that "only the development of transportation and economic construction in the Northwest and Southwest can provide a solid foundation for long-term resistance and national reconstruction. Only after the completion of the Northwest and Southwest transportation routes can the materials needed for our resistance and economic construction be fully supplied, without fear of shortages."

Therefore, since the government moved westward, it has been committed to completing the economic construction of the Southwest. In the past two years or so, the industries, finance, and transportation departments of the southwestern provinces have all made significant progress: such as the control of production and sales of local products such as Sichuan silk and tung oil, the commencement of the development of Kang and Yunnan gold mines, the accelerated construction of the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Burma roads, the completion of the interprovincial highway network, and the unification of currencies in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. These are all evident to all. Recently, the Southwest Economic Construction Commission and the Southwest Economic Construction Research Institute have been established to specialize in these matters, with unlimited prospects, further strengthening the people's belief that "the War of Resistance will surely be won, and the nation will surely be built."

Agriculture and Industry

The Central Agricultural Experiment Station has established five working stations in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, and Yunnan to expand the promotion of rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, cotton, industrial crops, tung oil, walnuts, silk, tea, and animal husbandry. The Agricultural Promotion Committee cooperates as much as possible with the Agricultural Bank and the Central Agricultural Experiment Station in a vertical direction. On the one hand, it directly interacts with farmers to promote the development of agricultural affairs.

In terms of rural economy, under the planning of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Agricultural Bank, and with the assistance of the banking sector, each province has established cooperative business offices, designated loan areas, established farmers' associations, and organized agricultural warehouses for storage, mortgage lending. Some banks have also established agricultural departments, adopting long-term, low-interest, annual repayment methods to implement various rural loans.

As for industry, the Central Industrial Experiment Station has established eleven laboratories in Chongqing and other places. The Executive Yuan has allocated five million yuan to establish the China Industrial Cooperative Association, dividing the country into five working areas: one is the Sichuan-Kang area, with the office in Chongqing; the second is the Northwest area, with the office in Baoji; the third is the Southeast area, with the office in Ganzhou; the fourth is the Yunnan area, with the office in Kunming; and the fifth is the Southwest area, with the office in Shaoyang. The association has greatly benefited the relocation of factories and the improvement of industrial technology. No fewer than 300 industrial enterprises from the Southeast and Central regions have successively moved into Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hunan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. These factories are dispersed throughout the region, all with the central goal of strengthening national defense and increasing the power of resistance. With the assistance of the government, the industries that have moved from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces to the Southwest include 22 machine factories, 10 chemical factories, 7 textile factories, 7 printing factories, 5 electrical factories, 3 ceramic factories, and other factories. In addition, there are also cement plants and paper mills newly established in Yunnan by Mr. Du Yuesheng and others, the Sichuan Alcohol Factory jointly operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Sichuan Provincial Government, the Wanxian Hydropower Plant, the Chongqing Oil Refinery, and the Southwest Trading Company and Huaxi Reclamation Company initiated and established by Mr. Chen Jiageng and others, with a capital of five million yuan each, planning to invest in the development of Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces.

(Editor's Note: The original text elaborated on transportation in great detail, which has been cut due to a separate article on the subject; apologies to the author.)

Finance

As the construction undertakings in the southwestern provinces flourished, the need for the assistance of the financial sector became more pressing. Industry and finance are mutually supportive and interdependent.

According to recent statistics, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and various commercial banks have established a total of 322 branches or offices in the Southwest: 81 in Guangdong, 48 in Guangxi, 59 in Hunan, 4 in Guizhou, 128 in Sichuan, and 11 in Yunnan. Eighteen banks have established 122 branches in the Southwest from other provinces, including 15 branches of the Central Bank of China, 27 branches of the Bank of China, 6 branches of the Bank of Communications, the Chinese Farmers Bank, 9 branches of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, 8 branches of the Yucheng Bank, 36 branches of the Zhongnan Bank, 3 branches each of the Guohua Bank, the Agricultural & Commercial Bank, and the Salt Bank, 2 branches of the China National Products Bank, and 1 branch each of the Continental Bank, the China Agricultural & Industrial Bank, the New China Savings & Trust Bank, the Jianghai Bank, the Dafu Commercial & Savings Bank, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and the Sihai Bank. The central points are Changsha, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, and Wuzhou.

Conclusion

The above are just a few of the major points. From this, it is sufficient to prove that the economic construction of the Southwest is in constant progress. The inland production that had stagnated for hundreds of years before the War of Resistance has unexpectedly flourished in the two years after the war. This can be said to be a miracle, and it is also driven by the circumstances of the times. From this, we can know that a semi-feudal and semi-colonial China must wait until it obtains national independence, civil rights equality, and improvement of people's livelihood before it can talk about developing the entire national economy.

### China's Transportation Construction

— Tang Xiaoyun

It has been more than two years since the War of Resistance began. What is the status of transportation construction in the southwestern and northwestern provinces during this long process? Everyone who cares about the War of Resistance and national reconstruction is eager to know. Although newspapers and magazines occasionally report on this issue, most are biased towards one province or one region. There are few comprehensive discussions on China's transportation construction during the war. The author will present what he knows to the readers.

### International Transportation Lines

A. Railways and Highways

Currently, there are the following three railways and highways that can handle the transportation of military supplies from abroad and strengthen the power of resistance:

The original Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. This railway starts from Haiphong in French Indochina, passes through Hanoi and Lao Cai on the Yunnan border, and reaches Kunming. It is currently the most important international transportation line.

The newly built Yunnan-Burma Highway. This road starts from Kunming, passes through Xiaguan near Dali, and turns into Lashio in Burma. The total length is 716 miles. From Lashio, there is a railway directly to Yangon, which is 630 miles long. This transportation line, with a total length of 1,346 miles, in addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, can be said to undertake a huge task in international transportation.

The greatest China-Soviet Highway in the Northwest. This road starts from Xi'an, crosses Gansu's Pingliang, Lanzhou, Jiuquan, Jiayuguan, and reaches Xinjiang's Hami, Dihua, Tacheng, to the Semipalatinsk Station on the Turkestan-Siberian Railway in Soviet Central Asia. The total length is 4,391 kilometers.

In addition, the following international transportation lines are being actively planned and constructed:

Guilin-Vietnam Line: This road starts from Yining, passes through Longjin (formerly known as Longzhou), Zhennanguan, and reaches Lang Son in Annam to reach Hanoi. The length is 258 kilometers, with 150 kilometers within China. The construction cost of this road is 12 million yuan. It has been surveyed that the section from Yining to Zhennanguan will be built by French investment, and the automobile road is now being laid along the line to prepare for the transportation of building materials. As an important trunk line for international transportation in the Southwest, the Ministry of Transportation is currently setting a deadline for its completion.

Yunnan-Burma Line: This line connects the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, starting from Kunming, passing through Dali and Tengchong, and reaching Lashio in Burma. The total length is more than 700 kilometers. The construction cost is about 60 million yuan. Recently, our government has reached an agreement with the British government to use a portion of the Sino-British loan to cover the construction costs. The line has also been surveyed and is under construction, using the Yunnan-Burma Highway as the basic route for transporting materials. After the completion of this road, it can reach Yangon and reach Southeast Asia and Europe. It also occupies a very important position in foreign transportation lines.

Xinjiang-Hai Line: This is the general term for the extension of the Longhai Railway to Xinjiang. After the completion of this road, it can connect to the Soviet Highway from Tacheng and Weitangzi to reach the Inland Railway in the Soviet Union, and then to Moscow and various parts of Europe. This road is the only way to closely link China and the Soviet Union, which must be built as soon as possible. It is said that the road is currently being planned and constructed.

B. Air Routes

Before the war, China's international air routes included six main lines: Hong Kong-Hanoi Line, Chongqing-Hong Kong Line, Shaanxi-Hong Kong Line, Kunming-Hong Kong Line, Guangdong-Hanoi Line, and Guangdong-Hanoi-West Line. After the war, because the original routes were insufficient, the following three international direct air routes were added:

China-Burma Route: It was originally scheduled to open in March this year, but the formal opening was delayed due to weaknesses found during the test flight. According to reports, the line has now officially opened.

China-Vietnam Route: The China Aviation Company of the Ministry of Transportation previously discussed with the French airline to open the Chongqing-Hanoi line between China and Vietnam. After obtaining the consent of the French side, a preliminary test flight was made on the morning of March 8 this year, and then the route was officially opened.

China-Soviet Route: This line starts from Chongqing, passes through Gansu and Xinjiang, and reaches Alma-Ata on the Turkestan-Siberian Railway in the Soviet Union, and then reaches Moscow. The official opening was also realized early. As for other routes, they are currently being actively prepared.

Domestic Transportation Lines

Domestic transportation lines can be divided into five categories: railways, highways, aviation, waterways, and telecommunications. The current construction situation of each item is briefly described as follows:

A. Railways

In the ten provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in the Southwest and Northwest, the total population is about 100 million, and the land area is 4.92 million square kilometers. However, there are only a few sections such as the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Tongguan-Xi'an section of the Longhai Railway, the Xi'an-Douji section, and the Ge Bi Shi section. The total length is only 900 kilometers. The government, in view of the fact that the development of the rich resources of the Southwest and Northwest is related to the heavy freight and military transportation, which cannot be undertaken by the railway that bears the heavy load and reaches far, so under the active progress, the following railways have been completed and opened to traffic, and are being built and planned:

Chengdu-Chongqing Railway: From Chengdu to Chongqing, the total length is 523 kilometers, and the construction cost is 15 million yuan. In addition to forming the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, the government collected a capital of 30 million yuan and borrowed 24.5 million yuan from the French banking group. The road started construction in mid-February of the year before last and is now officially open to traffic.

Sichuan-Yunnan Railway: From Xufu, Sichuan to Kunming, Yunnan, the total length is 1,170 kilometers, which is contracted by the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway Company. The following have been completed: the section from Xinjin to Wutongqiao, which is 142 kilometers long; the section from Wei to Qingshuixi, which is 15 kilometers long; and the section from Jiangmenchang to Xuyong, which is 10 kilometers long.

Hunan-Guangxi Railway: Starting from Hengyang Station on the Yuehan Railway, passing through Dulin, Liuzhou, Yining, Longzhou, to Zhennanguan on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam, and connecting to the branch line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the total length is 950 kilometers. It is built in four sections: the first section is Hengyang-Guilin, the second section is Guilin-Liuzhou, the third section is Liuzhou-Yining, and the fourth section is Yining-Zhennanguan. The Heng-Gui section, which is 300 kilometers long, requires a construction cost of 36 million yuan and was opened to traffic on October 1 last year after one and a half years of work. The remaining three sections are scheduled to be completed in the winter of this year.

Baoji-Chengdu and Douji-Lanzhou Railways: After the Longhai Railway reached Douji, there are two routes to the west and south: the route to the west aims at Lanzhou, and the route to the south ends at Chengdu. The government believes that the economic value of the Dou-Cheng line is greater, and it is also the main connection line between the two major railway systems in the Northwest and Southwest, so it decided to build it first. The road is about 500 kilometers long, and the construction cost is 50 million yuan. It has been prepared from the Belgian bank and will start construction soon. As for the Lanzhou line, it will be built immediately after the completion of the Baoji-Chengdu line.

Hunan-Guizhou Railway: The total length is about 1,000 kilometers, and the construction and equipment costs are about 160 million yuan; from Zhuzhou, it reaches Guiyang via Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Xinhua, and Zhijiang. The section from Zhuzhou to Xiangxiang has been completed.

Sichuan-Guizhou Railway: Starting from Chengdu, passing through Chongqing, Chongxihe, Songkan, Tongzi, and reaching Guiyang. The total length of the entire line is about 979 kilometers and it has been opened to traffic.

Sichuan-Shaanxi Railway: Starting from Chengdu, passing through Xindu, Guanghan, Deyang, Luojiang, Mianyang, Zitong, Jiange, Zhaohua, Guangyuan, and ending at Ningqiang, Shaanxi. The section from Mianyang to Ningqiang, which is about 412 kilometers long, has been opened to traffic; this section is under rush repair.

Sichuan-Hubei Railway: Starting from Jianyang Station, passing through Lezhi, Suining, Lianxi, Nanchong, Yuechi, Guang'an, Quxian, Dazhu, Liangshan, Wanxian, crossing the Yangtze River and reaching Lichuan in Hubei Province. The total length of the road is 809 kilometers, and the Jianyang-Quxian section, which is 470 kilometers long, has been opened to traffic; the section from the watershed to Wanxian, which is 45 kilometers long, has also been completed.

Sichuan-Xikang Railway: Starting from Chengdu, passing through Shuangliu, Xinjin, Qionglai, Mingshan, Ya'an, Tianquan, Luding, and reaching Kangding, the total length is 373 kilometers. The section from Chengdu to Ya'an, which is 173 kilometers long, is now open to traffic; the section from Ya'an to Kangding is under rush construction.

Sichuan-Guizhou Railway: This road starts from Tongyang on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road, passes through Zhangming, Jiangyou, Pingwu, Songpan, and reaches Qinghai via Suge Tibetan Temple; the total length is 552 kilometers. The section from Mianyang to Jiangyou, which is 53 kilometers long, has been opened to traffic.

Sichuan-Gansu Railway: Starting from Zhaohua Station on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road, passing through Baoningyuan and reaching Bikou in Gansu Province; the total length is about 100 kilometers, and it is also under planning and construction.

In addition, the government also plans to build the Baotou-Lanzhou Line, the Gansu-Xinjiang Line, and the Ningxia-Qinghai Line, with Lanzhou in the Northwest as the center. Once the above-mentioned railway network is completed, the Northwest and Southwest provinces can be connected as one.

B. Highways

According to the report of the Ministry of Transportation last year: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, more than 1,600 kilometers of new lines have been built and 1,622 kilometers of old lines have been repaired in the southwestern and northwestern provinces. This is the number for last year, and it is obviously not suitable for the present. (To be continued)

### Prospects for Japan's Shipping Industry During the War

— Li Shumin

(6) South American West Coast Line: From Hong Kong via Japan, Honolulu, San Francisco, down the west coast of the Americas to Valparaíso, Chile. Once a month.

(7) South American East Coast Line: From Japan via Hong Kong, Singapore, across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope, across the South Atlantic to Argentina and Brazil on the east coast of South America. Once a month.

(8) China Express Line: From Shanghai via Nagasaki to Kobe. Once every four days. This line has about two 5,000-ton giant ships traveling back and forth, taking 26 hours.

Looking at the above eight lines, one can get a general idea:

Japan also relies on other countries for imports of wartime raw materials and food (such as olive oil, rubber, iron, rice, cotton, etc.). If the war prevents imports, Japan will inevitably panic. In addition, the lessons learned from the UK in the previous Great War; in view of this, Japan will more actively take the same measures as the UK to exert its power in the Pacific theater and hope that its shipping commerce will expand to the East Indies, Southeast Asia, and North America. According to a famous Japanese commentator, Japan's shipping commerce in the year before last was as follows:

(1) To the Asian continent, north of Hong Kong - 19%

(2) To the Asian continent, south of Hong Kong (including Hong Kong) - 18%

(3) To the East Indies, Philippines, etc. - 11.5%

(4) To North and South America - 33%

(5) Others such as Singapore - 18.5%

The commentator hinted: During the war, 48% of the commerce will be cut off from the UK, and that 48% does not yet include the Americas and the northern part of the Asian continent.

During the last Great War, the UK blockaded its enemies in the depths of the ocean, so the commercial operations of the invaders were almost non-existent. However, this is the opposite for Japan, whose commerce can extend thousands of miles away, which is unbelievable. It can also eliminate or blockade the commercial aggression of various powerful countries and pay attention to commercial transportation under the protection of new cruisers. Therefore, the map of its shipping commerce expanded greatly during the last Great War. This can be confirmed by the following distances:

(1) Japan to Korea… 120 miles

(2) Japan to Shanghai… 470 miles

(3) Japan to San Francisco… 4,760 miles

(4) Japan to Mexico… 6,9[missing digit(s)]

If Japan's shipping commerce hopes to exist during the war, cruisers must be manufactured in large quantities, and according to an expert, each ship must weigh 300,000 tons. Because commercial activity during the war cannot be maintained thousands of miles away without cruisers. The original need was mostly used for the waterways between Japan and Korea and Shanghai, and then gradually expanded to Europe and England. According to Japan, maintaining its shipping commerce so that other countries can continuously supply raw materials and maintain its inherent export goods in order to stabilize the domestic economic situation was originally its two major wartime economic problems, and the solution to these two problems depends entirely on the contribution of cruisers. Therefore, cruisers will also be manufactured without limit, which cannot be limited by the 5:5:3 ratio.

### Finance: Hong Kong Gang Absorbs, Cooked Gold Rises 30 Yuan; Jewelry Gold and Pure Gold Needles Change

Cooked Gold

Yesterday's spot market conditions for cooked gold were without formal trading due to the Sunday holiday. However, outside the exchange, initially affected by the weak sentiment from the evening before, the price briefly fell to 4,080 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange firm strongly absorbed (reportedly entrusted by Hong Kong and local gangs), raising the price to 4,135 yuan. By midday, the situation had stabilized somewhat. The selling price at money exchange firms was quoted at 4,130 yuan, and the buying price was around 4,120 yuan, an increase of about 30 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price.

Jewelry Gold

The selling prices of gold jewelry at jewelry stores remained unchanged. Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng both maintained the price of 415 yuan per tael, unchanged from the original price. The buying price was reduced by about 20 yuan.

Pure Gold

According to a London dispatch on the 23rd, British pure gold remained at £8 8s per ounce.

### Sugar Market: A Batch of Rough Blue Sugar Has Arrived

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly tight. The association's opening price for spot raw white sugar outside the warehouse was initially 53.5 yuan, then rose to 54.5 yuan, an increase of one yuan. Taikoo Che Bai (Western Machine B Mark) was 97.5 yuan to 58.5 yuan, up 5 jiao. DY Mark (East Warehouse) was 56.2 yuan, HX Mark was 55 yuan, H Mark (Car Red) was 42 yuan, Dutch Red was 43 yuan, and there was not much change for the rest. A batch of domestic rough blue sugar has arrived, but the quantity is unknown.

### North-South Goods: Sophora Japonica Rises Again by 2-3 Yuan

The current arrival of Sophora japonica is scarce, and the land price is quite firm, so the Shanghai market has risen again. Ordinary goods have risen to 28-29 yuan, and high-quality goods are 37 yuan, an increase of another 2-3 yuan compared to before. The future market is still expected to tighten further.

### Seafood: White Pepper Stabilizes, Black Pepper Drops by 4-5 Yuan

Pepper prices have recently stabilized, and group traders have even withdrawn, so black pepper has dropped by 4-5 yuan. No. 1 pepper is 116 yuan, large black pepper is 115 yuan, and white pepper is stable, still priced at 140 yuan to 135 yuan.

### Tapioca Starch Arrives Sparsely, Pricey; Sago Also Rises by More Than 10 Yuan

Tapioca Starch: Due to the long-term lack of supply, the market stock is becoming increasingly scarce, so the trading price has risen again. Currently, Flying Unicorn is selling for 40 yuan, up 4 yuan. KG Mark and Three X Mark are both selling for 39 yuan, up 5 yuan. Double T Mark is 35 yuan, up 6 yuan.

Sago: Yesterday's market price was more than 10 yuan higher than in mid-July. Large grains are 38 yuan, and small grains are 35 yuan.

### Coal: Stockpilers Cut Prices and Sell; White Coal Trading is Active

After the price increase of Haifeng White Coal the day before yesterday, business was very quiet during the off-season. However, recently, a certain warehouse in Shanghai West, due to its location in a cross-border area and environmental factors, various stockpilers had to cut prices and sell, reducing the price by 3-4 yuan from the new price of 126 yuan to secure profits. Street customers also took the opportunity to absorb the coal, and trading became active, with daily transactions among fellow traders reaching 300-400 tons.

### Medicinal Materials: Unified Pinellia Tuber Price Difficult to Rise

Several packages of unified Pinellia tuber were opened, with a price of 125 yuan. Recently, it was heard that a certain shop still has five or six packages in stock, planning to sell them for 130 yuan. Both trading parties are negotiating, but no deal has been reached yet.

### Contributions from All Sectors, Belief in Resistance and National Construction Grows Stronger, Rumors Subside, Foreign Exchange Rate Achieves New Level, Bank of China's Legal Price Remains Unchanged

Recently, the Shanghai market was rife with peace rumors, and the prices of gold in the black market, cotton yarn, and government bonds experienced intense fluctuations. Subsequently, the central government strongly refuted the baseless rumors and reiterated its determination to resist the war and build the nation. These rumors then began to dissipate.

Gold and Cash Donations are Extremely Enthusiastic

The determination of citizens from all sectors in this city to resist the war and build the nation is growing stronger. The Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank, which are acting as agents for the collection of gold and cash donations, receive citizens who come to exchange and donate every day. Many people also specify the use of their donations, and their enthusiasm is admirable. As for the exchange of gold, the public is willing to exchange it for cash at the Bank of China's listed gold price, which is commendable. According to a statement from a Bank of China official yesterday, although the number of people going to the Bank of China to exchange gold and donate cash is not very large, people from all walks of life are represented. The amount of gold exchanged and cash donated is not yet planned to be announced.

Legal Foreign Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged

The Ministry of Finance is striving to stabilize foreign exchange rates to maintain the external value of the legal currency. Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, the foundation of foreign exchange across the country has become more solid. The legal foreign exchange rate announced by the Central Bank every day remains unchanged, and foreign exchange is supplied as much as possible for the import of essential goods for various industries.

Black Market Exchange Rate Forms a New Level

As for the Shanghai black market foreign exchange, it is now entirely manipulated by speculators. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has decided not to maintain it and will let it take its natural course. Since the outbreak of the European war, those who own foreign exchange panicked and sold it off. The foreign exchange market here showed a very strong upward trend, but within a few days, the feeling of fear subsided, and the exchange rate still hovered between 3.5 to 4 "ban shi." Therefore, when the current exchange rate falls below 3.5 "ban shi," it encounters strong resistance. On the other hand, it is not permitted by the environment to rise above 4 "ban shi." It seems to have become a "natural level."

Speculation and Rumors are Not Credible

Therefore, speculators cannot profit greatly and deliberately spread rumors to cause drastic fluctuations in the market, such as the peace rumors and the issuance of foreign exchange certificates that occurred recently. Now it has been confirmed that the rumors circulating in the market are completely without basis. However, various new rumors are still prevalent in the market. Therefore, fluctuations in the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange are in fact difficult to avoid, but the price in this black market for foreign exchange is no longer sufficient to represent the status of the legal currency.

### Soviet Consul Leaves Shanghai for Japan

Due to Political Developments, He is Transferred Elsewhere, and Will Soon be Replaced by Someone Else

The *North China Daily News* reports that the Soviet Consul in Shanghai, Konstantinov, along with a secretary from the consulate, left Shanghai for Japan yesterday (the 23rd) aboard the *Shanghai Maru*. It is said that these two officials have been transferred elsewhere due to recent political developments and will be replaced by others in mid-October. The consulate secretary, Kolomitsev, is currently in charge of everything. It is reported that the Soviet consulate just moved to its official building at 20 Huangpu Road from its temporary premises on Avenue Edward VII at the end of this week.

### Pretexting the European War, White Coal is Hoarded

Manufacturers are Extremely Anxious, Various Industries are Affected

When foreign exchange shrank frequently last month, coal merchants hoarded Indian coal and secretly collected and hoarded coal from a certain country, causing the market situation to change suddenly. They then took the opportunity to raise the price of coal without any bill of exchange relationship from more than 30 yuan per ton to more than 50 yuan suddenly, and then gradually raised it to more than 80 yuan, causing market disorder. Recently, under the pretext of the European war, they have collected and hoarded white coal, resulting in a shortage of fuel for several factories and a lack of goods to buy. The price of coal balls is also rising several times a day, and various manufacturers are extremely anxious.

### Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Settlement are Reported to the Consular Body for Handling, Thugs Rampant in Caojiadu, Western Shanghai, Public Bus Driver Kidnapped

According to reliable sources, the Municipal Council has reported the progress of negotiations on road construction beyond the settlement to the Consular Body. Because major administrative events concerning the International Settlement must be discussed by the Consular Body and reported to the governments of the relevant countries before a final decision can be made. Before the Consular Body comes up with a solution, the Municipal Council will do its utmost to safeguard its rights and interests. However, the Japanese-puppet side is adopting a nibbling attitude and constantly encroaching, so a confrontation between police and puppet police has formed in the area of road construction beyond the settlement, and the tense situation remains unabated.

Thugs Kidnap Driver in Broad Daylight

Wujiaochang in Caojiadu, western Shanghai, is the terminus of the No. 10 public bus line. Yesterday at 4:45 PM, a No. 31 bus on the No. 10 line was approaching the entrance of the Daxin Photo Studio when nine thugs in plain clothes, mostly wearing blue short trousers and jackets, suddenly stepped forward and ordered the driver of the bus, No. 390, to get out of the vehicle. When the driver refused, the thugs drew out their Mauser pistols to threaten him. The more than 20 passengers in the bus looked at each other in dismay and fled when the bus stopped. The driver was forced to get out of the bus and was taken away by the thugs to the west. When the incident occurred, nearby police and puppet police looked at each other without intervening. The reason for the kidnapping is unknown.

Ten Puppet Police Stations Have Already Been Established

Japanese and puppet military and police have encroached upon the area of road construction beyond the settlement, attempting to seize police power and actively expanding the establishment of puppet police stations in the area. According to an on-the-spot investigation by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, there are puppet police stations at the following locations: (1) Lane in Da Xi Road, (2) Zhu Jia Zhai in Da Xi Road, (3) Intersection of Da Xi Road and Columbia Road, (4) Zhu An Long in Yidingpan Road, (5) Opposite Anle Factory in Bailinan Road, (6) Western End of Triangle Field in Route des Soeurs, (7) Eastern End of Jiaozhou Road in Robison Road, (8) Opposite the China Light Bulb Factory in Robison Road, (9) Jin Situ Temple in Route des Soeurs, (10) Intersection of Connaught Road and Singapore Road. The above ten locations all belong to the "Western District Branch" of the puppet police at the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Route Kener.

### Cotton Shipped to Shanghai is Detained, Negotiations are Underway

A large batch of cotton shipped from Beisha to Shanghai was detained by the Japanese at the Waterside Hotel. Because yesterday was a weekly holiday, the owners of the goods must wait until today to conduct negotiations. More than 1,000 bales of cotton shipped from Beisha to Shanghai on the Wulin and Jiangding vessels two days ago have been safely withdrawn from the bank and stored in warehouses by the owners.

### Li Ruzhang, Executive of the Refugee Children's Education Institute, Assassinated, Attacked While Seeing Guests off at the Tianchan Theater Yesterday, One Bullet Hit a Vital Point and He Died

A shooting occurred in front of the Tianchan Theater at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yunnan Road at approximately 12:40 PM yesterday. The victim was Li Ruzhang, the executive director of the Refugee Children's Education Institute in this city. The case is confusing, and there are conflicting reports. The details of what happened are recorded as follows:

Broadcasting and Fundraising for New Institute

The Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute was established last winter. Its address is No. 9, Lane 78, Avenue Joffre and Rue du Père Robert, French Concession. It houses 500 refugee children, with Yuan Lidun as chairman and Chen Jicheng as director, and Li Ruzhang as the institute's executive director. Thanks to the enthusiastic donations of philanthropists from all walks of life, it has achieved remarkable results. Because the original site was too small, another site was built at No. 99, Lane 258, Wuding Road, International Settlement. Yesterday, on the occasion of the completion of the new site, a broadcasting program was specially held at six radio stations in this city, including Tianchan, Zhongxi, Zhongmei, Xindu, Commercial, and Xinsheng, to encourage the adoption of refugee children and raise funds for the construction of workshops.

Suddenly Shot While Seeing Guests into a Car

Li Ruzhang was responsible for reception and general reporting at the Tianchan Radio Station. He was wearing a suit and glasses and worked very hard. Around 12:30 PM, after the speech by a certain gentleman, Li rose to thank him on behalf of the institute and escorted him downstairs to his car. Unexpectedly, as the guest was stepping into the car and about to leave, gunshots suddenly rang out near the entrance of the station, with two shots fired in quick succession. At that time, the guest car had already started its engine and sped away. Li suddenly fell to the ground after the gunshots. The assassin, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled into the crowd and disappeared without a trace.

Critically Wounded in the Abdomen and Died

Although nearby police officers immediately searched, the assassin had disappeared. The information was reported to the police station in charge, which dispatched detectives to search and investigate. The Tianchan Theater was suddenly closed temporarily for a thorough search, but there were no results. Li Ruzhang was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was discovered that Li had been shot once in the back, the bullet entering the abdomen and exiting from the front, and because of excessive bleeding, his condition was extremely critical. The hospital doctors tried their best to rescue him, but unfortunately, the injury was too severe and in a vital area, and he died of his injuries in the hospital at approximately 2:00 PM that afternoon. His body has been sent to the morgue and will be reported to the court for inspection this morning before being transferred to the Leyuan Funeral Home on Jundunxin Road. The funeral will be held tomorrow afternoon, and the affairs will be handled by the colleagues of the education institute.

Former County Magistrate Now Runs Charity

Li Ruzhang was a native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and was 52 years old. He was upright, determined, and exceptionally chivalrous towards his friends. He served as the secretary of the Business Section of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the county magistrate of Jiaxing County, and the military law officer of the 26th Army. In 1927, he began to organize education and established Ximen Primary School. After the August 13th Incident, he was deeply moved by the suffering of refugee children and strove to establish the education institute. After several months of hard work, he succeeded in the end, and his contribution was very great. At that time, only 27 refugee children were admitted. Li's residence was at No. 203, Rue Saussure, French Concession, and his wife also lives in Shanghai.

The Rice Stabilization Program Has Completely Ended, 8,059.19 Shi of Tribute Rice Sold, Totaling More Than 161,000 National Currency, The Second Rice Stabilization Program Will Be Temporarily Postponed

The four Tribute Rice Stabilization Program locations have sold off the daily allocation of 7,000 bags of good tribute rice, which was completely sold out the day before yesterday. Yesterday, each rice stabilization location continued to sell broken rice for one day, thus ending the program. A total of 8,059.19 shi of tribute rice was sold in the two settlements, yielding a total of more than 161,183.8 yuan in national currency. The second rice stabilization program has been temporarily postponed. The details are as follows:

The Four Rice Stabilization Locations Have Already Closed

The five tribute rice locations in the British and French concessions, except for the first location at the intersection of North Henan Road and Lao Bazhi Road, which closed on the 20th of this month, the four locations including the second and third locations in the International Settlement and the fourth and fifth locations in the French Concession, have sold off the daily allocation of 7,000 bags of good tribute rice, which was completely sold out the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they continued to sell broken rice for one day, a total of 1,000 bags, 250 bags per location, all of which were sold by 3:00 PM yesterday. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited the four rice stabilization locations in the British and French concessions yesterday. According to the persons in charge of each location, the 1,000 bags of broken rice were of very good quality and very dry, so the common people who bought this broken rice were all very happy. It has been decided to close today. As for the third location (Yufosi Temple on Binlang Road), all the used items were transferred to the Rice Merchants Association yesterday.

Rice Stabilization Statistics Are Largely Completed

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Zhang Nianxuan, the chairman of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, yesterday. According to Zhang, the rice stabilization locations have achieved remarkable results since the beginning and can be closed. The rice stabilization statistics are as follows: The first location sold rice for four days, a total of 959.78 shi, selling 18,900 1-dou tickets, 1,200 5-sheng tickets, and 489 2-sheng tickets, totaling 19,195.6 yuan in national currency. The second location sold rice for seven days, a total of 1,985.69 shi, selling 15,900 1-dou tickets, 7,781 5-sheng tickets, and 332 2-sheng tickets, totaling 39,713.8 yuan in national currency. The third location sold rice for seven days, a total of 1,728.3 shi, selling 15,763 1-dou tickets, 3,000 5-sheng tickets, and 100 2-sheng tickets, totaling 34,566 yuan in national currency. The fourth location sold rice for seven days, a total of 1,753.82 shi, selling 12,000 1-dou tickets, 10,990 5-sheng tickets, and 216 2-sheng tickets, totaling 35,076.4 yuan in national currency. The fifth location sold rice for seven days, a total of 1,631.6 shi, selling 12,200 1-dou tickets, 7,272 5-sheng tickets, and 2,400 2-sheng tickets, totaling 32,632 yuan in national currency. In total, the five locations sold rice for 32 days. The three locations in the International Settlement sold a total of 4,673.77 shi of rice, and the two locations in the French Concession sold a total of 3,385.42 shi of rice. The five locations in the two settlements sold a total of 8,059.19 shi of good tribute rice, selling a total of 64,763 1-dou tickets, 30,243 5-sheng tickets, and 3,537 2-sheng tickets, for a total of 161,183.8 yuan in national currency. All of the above funds have been turned over to the designated bank. In addition, yesterday's sale of broken rice collected 16,578.8 yuan. It is reported that there are still residual rice and rotten rice at each location, which are still being settled. This rice stabilization program was for the service of the common people, so the measuring of rice could not be too strict, but across the four locations, the loss was only about 3 sheng per shi.

The Second Rice Stabilization Program Will Be Temporarily Postponed

Regarding the second rice stabilization program, after consultations between various groups and the committee members of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, it was decided to postpone it temporarily. According to Mr. Zhang Nianxuan, the chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, speaking to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday, the first rice stabilization program will end today, but the 8,000 bags of Saigon rice in the first program were only a drop in the bucket and of no help. Fortunately, the directors of each location commanded properly, and the authorities of the two settlements sent police to protect and maintain order. However, the second rice stabilization program is highly anticipated and is deeply hoped to be realized. After consultation, it has been decided to postpone it temporarily, but the reasons are as follows: (1) Because the amount of national rice shipped to Shanghai has increased sharply, hoarders have disappeared, and rice prices have begun to fall; (2) New goods have already entered the market in rice-producing areas such as Wuhu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Changshu, and Kunshan, and may be shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream in the short term; (3) The rice market has turned to clear sales, and large households have a considerable amount of rice stored up, and various groups have jointly ordered foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for adjustment; (4) The autumn harvest is approaching, and the grains are abundant. Rice merchants are afraid of unexpected losses and have lowered prices for sale, so the entire Shanghai food supply is not threatened by a shortage, and prices are tending to fall. Moreover, it is quite difficult to carry out the rice stabilization program.

The No. 1 District North of the Suzhou Creek Remains Peaceful After the Change of Defense, But Residents are Forced to be Injected, Japanese Troops Patrol Regularly

The situation in the No. 1 district north of the Suzhou Creek, from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, after the change of defense lines between the British and Japanese, and the Japanese troops began to take over the defense of the area, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The continued situation is recorded below:

Japanese Troops Patrol Regularly

Yesterday, the number of sentries posted by the Japanese troops in front of the Shanghai Telephone Company at the western intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road was increased to two. There are still no Japanese troops stationed at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Lao Bazhi Road. The Railway Hospital at the western end of the road has not yet been occupied by the Japanese troops and remains as it was. However, Japanese troops regularly send patrols within the area they have taken over.

Residents are Forced to be Injected

There are many local residents waiting for injections around the injection station under the canvas shed set up by the Japanese in front of the Shanghai Telephone Company at the western intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. These people must line up when entering the shed and proceed in order from the west side of the Shanghai Telephone Company. There are many women mixed in the line. These people will be refused residence in the area by the Japanese if they do not undergo this injection.

No Inconvenience, City Appearance Unchanged

The situation of the British troops stationed at the iron gate at the end of North Henan Road is the same as yesterday, but the number of British soldiers has been increased by two. The British troops have set up a new post on the side of the Qianjiang Guild Hall on the west side of North Henan Road and Haining Road, with two British soldiers defending it. Because there are no restrictions or inconveniences for the shops and residents in the defense area, they are very calm and the city appearance is unchanged.

Property Rights in the Occupied Areas are Strictly Prohibited from Being Changed, Exploiting Opportunities to Seize and Transfer, Legally Ineffective

The National Government strictly prohibits the illegal change of property rights in the occupied areas. According to the announcement, public and private property rights in the occupied areas must not be illegally transferred or seized. Those who are malicious exploit the extraordinary period and the failure to restore local order to seize the property rights of others or deliberately destroy evidence as a step to seize and transfer property. These are not only legally ineffective, but also a violation of criminal law. All relevant agencies in the occupied areas have been ordered and the people are allowed to report secretly in preparation for a thorough investigation.

The Pacific Sailing Ship Has Disappeared Without a Trace, Hopes for the Safety of Andersen and Others Have Been Largely Abandoned, No News Has Been Received for 71 Days

The *Continental Daily News* reports that news was learned from Shanghai last night (the 23rd) that all hope has been abandoned for the safety of American navigator Andersen and his sailing ship *Pacific*. According to Mr. Mortimer, the chairman of the board of the Sino-American Book Company, the owner of the *Pacific* sailing ship, he had hoped to hear from Andersen again, but that hope has now been abandoned. Andersen sailed from Shanghai with the intention of crossing the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. He encountered a series of unfortunate events along the way. The last time news was received was on July 13, when there were Andersen, his Russian wife, four crew members, and a dog and cat on board, and they were running out of food and water. Fortunately, they were heard by the *President Coolidge* near Meetwhistle Island, which provided them with drinking water and food. Forty-five minutes later, the *President Coolidge* continued on its way to Shanghai. Before leaving, Andersen said that he could reach San Francisco in at most 50 days. However, 71 days have passed since then, and no news has been received of Andersen and the *Pacific*. Although there is still a faint hope that the ship is still afloat, the ship's water supply was only enough to last for 55 days at most. In that case, Andersen and others have been without water for 16 days. Andersen is one of the Pacific's most famous American captains and has 31 years of maritime experience. Going to San Francisco on the *Pacific* to attend the New York World's Fair may have been his last voyage. The hope that they are still alive has largely disappeared. The Renji Hospital August report stated that there were 22,966 outpatients, 608 inpatients, 61 male suicides, 74 female suicides, 17 factory accidents, 615 patients sent by the Public Concession police, and 52 patients sent by the French Concession police. Looking at the above figures, the work in August increased by 10% compared to the previous month. The number of factory accidents decreased by 50%, which is an exception. The diseases treated were all summer epidemics.

### Unprecedented Disaster in Centuries, Severe Floods in North China, Natural and War Disasters Cause Immense Suffering, International Relief is Striving to Help, Mr. Edwards Returns to Shanghai After Traveling Through the Flooded Areas

The *Continental Daily News* reports that Mr. Edwards, the secretary of the International Committee of the YMCA and acting chairman of the China International Famine Relief Commission, has just returned to Shanghai after traveling through the flood area of North China. He told reporters yesterday (the 23rd) that there is a terrible flood tragedy in North China now, and the main disaster that will follow it will be famine. It is expected that when winter comes, countless people will suffer the indescribable pain of this disaster. Coupled with the disasters of war, this disaster will be the most tragic disaster China has encountered in centuries. In the past, when North China encountered floods, the two major markets of the three northeastern provinces and Inner Mongolia, which were controlled by the Japanese, provided food relief. These two markets are now closed. In the flooded area itself, on the one hand, it is still suffering from a long drought, and on the other hand, large areas of land in Hebei and Shandong provinces have become marshes. There will be no grain to be harvested this year. Once the cold season comes, many people will die of famine and disease. During the North China floods of 1920, the three northeastern provinces and Inner Mongolia transported millet and grains by train every day for three months, which were distributed by the committee, and the great famine was avoided. Now that the two markets have been closed, and the distribution of food must be determined by the local Japanese authorities, it is quite difficult. The committee is currently considering the possibility of purchasing American wheat. To achieve this goal, the committee and its relief committee in Tianjin and Peking need 3 million yuan, but it has only received 300,000 yuan. The New York-based Church Committee for China Relief has already sent US$10,000, but this is only a portion of the funds needed. It is expected that the current water level in the flooded area will not recede until the freezing season. During his trip to North China, he has seen a pitiful sight. In the Tianjin area, many families are still living on the roofs of their houses, and food and drinking water are transported and supplied by boats. From Tianjin to Tanggu, 30 miles to the south, there is nothing but a sea, which can be called the greatest flood disaster in Chinese history. Only the flood disaster can be fought against, but since there is war, there must be a great humanitarian struggle to save the innocent from starving to death, that is, to struggle to obtain and control the food and supplies urgently needed in the area.

### Planning Happiness Sets Sail

Derping's Loading is Insufficient and Postponed, Norwegian Ship Dabu's Voyage to Ningbo Undecided

Moufuk, of German merchant Reiss & Co.'s shipping department, returned to Shanghai from Zhenhai on the 15th of this month, and anchored at Jin Liyuan Wharf. As it was delayed by a dispute when weighing anchor from Zhenhai, it has now been resolved and will sail as usual. The ship weighed anchor and sailed to Zhenhai at 4:30 PM yesterday, and will arrive at the Zhenhai port this morning. According to the shipping industry, according to international law, ships of belligerent countries are not subject to any hindrance when sailing on the coast of neutral countries. Furthermore, the Derping, of Sino-Italian company, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 24th, but according to a telegram, it was postponed to the 26th due to insufficient loading. In addition, Dabu, of Norwegian merchant Wah Lun & Co., which was originally scheduled to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route today, is now still under consideration because the number of ships on the route has increased and the cargo transport is relatively light.

### Mail Ship Arrivals

Coolidge and Chepad Arrive Today, Ellora Departs Shanghai for Bombay

The United States President Lines' Pacific regular mail ship

The Great Britain Company's *Ellora* (i.e., *Mylapore*) is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Japan around the 26th and is scheduled to depart for Bombay on the 27th. The report in the newspaper the day before yesterday that the ship was departing from Shanghai for London was a misreport. Moreover, the company's voyages of all ships traveling to the Far East have been completely suspended since the outbreak of the European war. It is currently undecided whether they will resume next month.

### A Strange Case of Sinking a Giant Ship at Gaochang Temple's Jiangnan Shipyard: The Sunken Ship Was a Chinese Vessel Salvaged and Then Deliberately Sunk After Repairs and Trial Run

A strange case of a giant ship being deliberately sunk occurred at the Jiangnan Shipyard near Gaochang Temple in the Nanshi district on the night of the 21st. The Japanese side is taking this matter extremely seriously, suspecting it to be the work of patriotic Chinese. A large number of workers are expected to be detained and interrogated. It is reported that the Jiangnan Shipyard was seized after the war and renamed "Mitsubishi Shipyard." Several foremen with a money-grubbing mentality were used to recruit ignorant Chinese laborers, reaching three to four thousand in number, specifically to repair damaged Japanese warships or merchant vessels.

Repairs Completed After Four Months

In May of this year, a giant ship, which had been sunk by the Chinese side during the war, was salvaged from somewhere and towed into the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. After four months, the repairs were completely finished. On the 21st, the ship was moved from the dock into the water and moored in the center of the river, waiting to be fired up for a trial run. However, at midnight that day, several leaks suddenly appeared in the bottom of the ship, which could not be stopped. Upon discovering this, the watchman quickly fled in a small boat, narrowly escaping being submerged with the ship.

Entirely Submerged Within an Hour

The ship was entirely submerged within one hour, and the watchman, fearing the consequences, also fled completely. The following morning, the Japanese military authorities were informed of the incident. After investigating, it appeared to be a type of ship-sinking technique premeditated by patriotic Chinese. They were immediately enraged and began to search and arrest workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard. All those who had participated in the repair of the ship, numbering over a hundred, were detained. There were no leads, and it is reported that some have been released, while others are still under strict interrogation.

### Refugee Relief Cooperative Agrees to Establish Three Factories

Sock Factory to Open Next Month; Fundraising Campaign Launched

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Cooperative, recognizing the large concentration of refugees in the city, has decided to establish factories and other production ventures to provide sustainable support for the refugees. Yesterday at noon, they convened a meeting of all directors and supervisors to discuss raising funds. Leaders from various industries, including Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Zhaoyuan, Pan Zhaobang, Yang Caoxian, and several dozen others, were invited. The cooperative's executive director, Chen Peide, and general manager, Yin Rangneng, successively reported on the cooperative's affairs. After deliberation, a fundraising method was decided upon, with the goal of raising enough capital to begin production work for the refugees. Three factories will be established to produce socks, towels, handkerchiefs, and miscellaneous goods. A section of the sock factory has already been established, and the opening ceremony is scheduled for the first of next month. A fundraising campaign to promote the products will be launched, with various industry leaders soliciting donations. This kind of sustainable relief effort will undoubtedly be supported by enthusiastic members of society. Among them, Yang Caoxian generously donated all his capital of over four thousand yuan to the production fund.

### Many Businesses Settle Accounts at the Mid-Autumn Festival, Generating Significant Profits

Stockpiling Various Goods Proves Profitable; Smooth Passage Through the Festival Guaranteed

The day after tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival. As per usual custom, businesses in all industries will settle their accounts. Members of the silver and currency exchange guilds will all take a day off. Currently, various companies and firms are sending personnel to collect outstanding debts from both local and out-of-town customers as the Mid-Autumn settlement period approaches. Due to the fact that most transactions after the war are conducted in cash, special attention is paid to extending credit. Therefore, there are absolutely no bad debts this Mid-Autumn Festival. Businesses have generated significant profits by stockpiling goods after the outbreak of the European war, so a smooth passage through this Mid-Autumn Festival is guaranteed. As for the overall financial market, it has remained stable thanks to the lending and discounting activities of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China, as well as the regulatory efforts of the Silver and Currency Exchange Preparation Committee and the effectiveness of the new remittance system. However, trading on the black market is subject to fluctuations due to manipulation by speculators, but this is unrelated to the overall financial situation.

### Belgian Ambassador de Ryckman de Betz Has Returned to Shanghai

According to the French-language Shanghai Journal of the 24th, Belgian Ambassador to China de Ryckman de Betz recently returned to Shanghai on the Japanese ship "Koteng Maru" and has resumed his duties.

### Encouraging Overseas Chinese Investment and Development by Providing Various Conveniences; Incentive Measures Have Been Revised by the Ministry; Acquired Rights Remain Valid After the War

The Chinese government is fully committed to developing its resources and encouraging overseas Chinese to invest in domestic economic enterprises. Since the promulgation of the incentive measures, overseas Chinese, such as Hu Wenhu, have organized inspection groups to return to China for investigations and have raised large sums of money to invest domestically, such as establishing factories and cooperating with the authorities to develop mines, as well as various other construction projects. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has revised the incentive measures, stipulating that for any economic enterprise, including those related to agriculture, mining, industry, commerce, and national defense, where overseas Chinese capital accounts for more than 60% of the total capital, the following incentives and assistance may be provided: (1) operational and technical guidance and assistance; (2) reduction or exemption of taxes; (3) facilitation of transportation and reduction of freight rates; (4) use of public land; (5) interest guarantees on capital and bonds; (6) provision of subsidies; (7) security guarantees; and (8) awarding of honorary memorabilia. In addition, state-owned economic enterprises may be invested in or jointly operated with special permission from the Ministry. In the event of special difficulties, relief may be requested. After the end of the war, the rights already acquired by overseas Chinese under the incentive measures shall remain valid. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has joined forces with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to encourage overseas Chinese to actively invest. However, when overseas Chinese apply for incentives, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission must certify that they are indeed overseas Chinese. For companies established by overseas Chinese with their headquarters in their place of residence, when establishing the first branch in China, the certification stipulated in Article 43 of the Company Registration Rules may be provided by the Chinese consulate or the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the location of the headquarters.

### French Police Department Strictly Prevents Theft

Recently, the French Police Department has noted that as autumn arrives and the weather gradually turns colder, coupled with the rising cost of living in Shanghai, unscrupulous individuals are taking advantage of the situation, leading to several cases of robbery and snatching occurring daily in succession. In order to maintain the peace and security of businesses and residents within the Concession and to eliminate traces of theft, the Police Department has dispatched teams of Chinese, Western, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives, armed and patrolling various parts of the Concession day and night. They are also searching passersby. Furthermore, with the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, businesses are routinely sending personnel to collect debts, often carrying cash. The Police Department has issued a special order to all detectives to pay close attention, investigate and arrest bandits and petty thieves, in order to maintain order and protect safety.

### Real Estate Tycoon Qu Hongsheng Passes Away Due to Illness

The well-known Shanghai real estate tycoon, Qu Hongsheng, who was highly respected for his service to the community, unfortunately fell ill last month. Despite receiving meticulous treatment from famous doctors, he did not improve and passed away yesterday afternoon. The encoffining is scheduled for today at the Paradise Funeral Home.

### Two Gangs of Thieves Arrested for Soliciting Prostitutes, Celebrating and Dividing Loot; Nine Criminals to Be Prosecuted, Three Prostitutes Released

On the evening of the 22nd of this month, at around 12 o'clock, the French Concession Police Department received a tip-off that the Xinruixing Inn in Bulinli, Gongguan Road, was a center for robbery and pickpocketing gangs. Detectives Mao Jinsheng, Ke Enqing, and Ke Enqi, among others, were dispatched to the address. At the time, the thieves were gathered around candles, celebrating and dividing their loot. Lu A'gen, Ding Yuan'san, Dong Mingguang, Xu A'bao, and four others were apprehended on the spot, and a large amount of stolen goods was confiscated. They confessed that they usually committed theft and robbery in the Ningxing Street vegetable market and in front of the Great World entertainment complex. They also revealed that their main headquarters was located at the Faxing Inn, No. 26 Diandang Street. Based on this information, the head of the detectives dispatched the original detectives to the address. Unexpectedly, a large number of thieves were also gathered in the room, soliciting prostitutes and celebrating. The detectives entered and apprehended them all, including Feng Yao, Chen Xianggen, Wang Jinrong, Ge Hongshun, Yan Jinsheng, and five others, as well as three prostitutes. A large number of stolen goods, witnesses and evidence were also confiscated and taken to the police station. After investigation, the three prostitutes were found to have no criminal suspicion and were immediately released. Yesterday, the criminals were sent to the Second Special Criminal Court for prosecution, where Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated them separately. He ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Local Security Chief Zhu Guisheng Sued for Fraud; Both Parties Reach a Settlement

Yu Qingyuan, a native of this city residing at No. 18 Yu Jia Lane, Huage'nie Road, French Concession, had previously needed funds and thus started a mutual aid association with a total of 48 members, each paying a membership fee of 60 yuan per term. After a considerable period, due to Yu Qingyuan's death, the association was dissolved. At that time, Zhu Guisheng (also known as Nuo Ruiqing), who had served as a local security chief, was also a member.

A Total of 1,740 Yuan in Association Fees and a Loan of 300 Yuan to Yu Qingyuan, totaling 2,040 Yuan: Yu's son, Yu Fangben, used a certificate of land ownership for a plot of land measuring 3 fen 4 li 1 hao, Block 9, Yunziwei, No. 11 Special District, Huage'nie Road, to pledge to Zhu as security for repayment. However, another member, Yao Zhijiang, also had unpaid association fees of 670 yuan and filed a lawsuit against Yu Fangben.

Settlement Reached: However, Yu did not fulfill the settlement terms, leading Yao to request the Second Special Court to execute the land certificate pledged to Zhu. The Second Special Court issued an order instructing Zhu to submit the certificate to the court. In addition to complying with the order, Zhu also petitioned to participate in the distribution of the proceeds. Yu then expressed his objection. Zhu formally filed a lawsuit against Yu for debt repayment. During the proceedings, Yu Fangben suddenly filed a lawsuit against Zhu Guisheng in the criminal division of the First Special Court, accusing him of

Fraud and Breach of Trust: Yu claimed that the land certificate was given to Zhu to obtain a business license from the Land Bureau, but Zhu obtained it through malicious and fraudulent means, thus committing the crime of fraud and breach of trust and requesting that he be punished according to the law. Zhu also hired lawyer Zhao Chuanding to defend him, explaining the facts of the case and arguing that Yu's lawsuit had ulterior motives and requesting that he be declared innocent. The case was then mediated by relatives and friends of both parties, who argued that since the two parties

Were Relatives (Yu Qingyuan was the wife's brother of Zhu Guisheng's brother, Zhu Guifu), it was inappropriate for them to litigate against each other. As a result, Yu admitted to repaying the association fees owed to Zhu Guisheng in installments. Therefore, yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the First Special Court heard the case of Yu Fangben suing Zhu Guisheng for fraud and breach of trust. The plaintiff, Yu Fangben, immediately requested to withdraw the lawsuit. After questioning by Judge Jiang, the withdrawal of the lawsuit was approved.

### More Than a Dozen Thugs Robbed Goods Late at Night; Three Arrested and Sent to Court

Chen Laohu, a local resident who works as a lighterman, had his lighter fully loaded with peanuts on the afternoon of the 13th of this month. Due to the late hour, the lighter was docked at Pier 4 of the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund. Unexpectedly, more than a dozen thugs, including Zhou Dingsheng (from Gaoyou, nicknamed "Pockmarked Face"), Lin Minxin (from Huzhou, nicknamed "Trumpet"), Li Changsheng (also known as "Little Shandong"), Little Rotten Foot, Little Yang, Wu Jintang, and others, swarmed onto the boat, forcibly trying to seize the peanuts. Upon seeing this, Chen resisted and shouted for help. The thugs used iron bars to beat Chen severely, and stole two large bundles of peanuts. Afterwards, Chen reported the incident to the Water Police, who dispatched detective Qu Deming and arrested Zhou Dingsheng, Lin Minxin, and Li Changsheng on separate occasions in the past few days. Yesterday, they were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. After questioning each of them, Judge Qiu ordered a postponement for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Overview for August: Cholera Season Has Passed, Malaria Significantly Increased

Last month, the health situation in the city was similar to normal, without any major events worthy of attention. Dysentery and diarrhea increased seasonally, but did not reach the same levels as in the same month last year. Twenty-eight cases of confirmed cholera were reported. Considering the population of the city, the number of cases was extremely small and not indicative of a spreading trend. Moreover, cholera epidemics generally occur before the end of August. The cholera season has passed, and even if it does spread, it will be mild. However, the situation in the city is special, and the future is unpredictable. The Municipal Council's slaughterhouse has seen a significant reduction in operations since the outbreak of the Shanghai War in the previous year, but has recently returned to its pre-war state. Malaria has increased significantly, but because some of the areas where this disease occurs are not under the jurisdiction of the Health Department, it is impossible to control it.

The number of recorded Chinese deaths was 2,767, of which 1,619 were exposed corpses. The main causes of death were typhoid fever, tuberculosis, dysentery, and diarrhea. Sixty-eight people requested treatment for rabies from the Health Department. 162,697 cubic centimeters of cholera vaccine and 13,925 doses of smallpox vaccine were distributed. 139 cubic centimeters of typhoid and paratyphoid vaccine were distributed. The Municipal Council's isolation hospitals were relatively quiet, but the police hospital remained busy, admitting 225 Chinese patients and 28 Indian patients. The School Medical Section held a summer trachoma prevention campaign, with clinics open all day to treat students with trachoma from various Chinese elementary schools. A total of 335 students voluntarily sought treatment, a decrease of 110 from July. Members were dispatched to inspect 170 Chinese private schools receiving subsidies from the Municipal Council. As a result, 23 schools were found to have unsatisfactory internal health conditions, and were notified or warned accordingly.

The vegetable markets operated as usual. A total of 3,859 pigs were imported from other ports and landed on the Bund, an increase of over 1,400 from the previous month. 8,154 residents were vaccinated against smallpox by the Health Department, and 137,453 were vaccinated against other diseases. Since the start of the disease prevention campaign in April of this year, a total of 585,680 residents have been vaccinated. The work to eliminate mosquitoes and flies has been quite effective. The refugee shelters within the Concession housed a total of 39,342 refugees, about the same as the previous month. The health situation was satisfactory. A total of 2,299 bodies were cremated and 763 coffins were buried.

### Investigation of the Suspects in the Chen Weida Burglary Case Still Required

At 7:30 AM on the 6th of this month, the home of Chen Weida, a local resident at No. 13, Lane 170, Route Lafayette, French Concession, was suddenly invaded by four armed bandits, who robbed them of over a thousand yuan in cash and jewelry. The bandits fled after obtaining the loot. Chen filed a loss report with the French police station, requesting the arrest of the thieves. At 5:00 PM on the 12th, Shao Zuoting (28 years old), a native of Ningbo working as a rice shop employee at No. 11 Broadway Building, Broadway Road, was waiting for his wife near the trolley station at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue du Marché in the French Concession. He was spotted by Wang A'bao, a maid in the Chen Weida household, who identified Shao as one of the robbers. He was taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court, requesting detention for investigation and postponement for further questioning. Details have been noted in this newspaper. It is now known that Shao, during the investigation at the police station, produced five colleagues to testify that he was working at the Broadway Building and had not gone out at the time of the Chen family robbery. The case was heard by Judge Miao Qingbang on the morning of the day before yesterday. Lawyer Chen, representing the French Concession administration, presented the facts of the case and filed a lawsuit according to the law. The defendant, Shao Zuoting, hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to defend him, arguing that he was mistakenly identified as a robber by the victim. Chen Bangqian, the daughter of Chen Weida, appeared in court. Given the complexity of the testimony of the witnesses, which required detailed verification, it was ordered that the hearing be postponed to the 27th. The defendant was temporarily returned to custody.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Please Transfer Festival Feast Expenses to Donate to Refugees for Winter Clothing

— Qiu Lang

Among all festivals, the Chinese people are most interested in entertainment as well as in food. For example, there are many shops or families that are very frugal with their meals on ordinary days. However, when it comes to the "New Year" or "festivals", they must have rich fish and meat to feast on! The meaning behind this is that shops reward their employees and students for their hard work during the festival, while families gather together to celebrate the holiday or invite relatives and friends to dine together to connect and express their feelings. This is quite normal. Now that the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival (the 27th) has arrived, it is expected that some shops and families will once again have a lively feast with various dishes and drinks.

In terms of timing, since it is Mid-Autumn Festival, if it were a peaceful time, people could enjoy drinking and having fun to celebrate this annual holiday. But what time is it now? The national crisis is severe, the environment is harsh, prices are soaring, and it is difficult to make a living. What is the situation in various parts of the country? Recently, the Tianjin floods have affected countless disaster victims! Even in this isolated island of Shanghai, which is said to have a population of five million, the poor account for a large proportion. The incident of people being injured or killed while scrambling for cheap rice shows how many people are living in misery! As for the refugees in this city, their numbers have not decreased. Although Mr. Yu Qiaqing has allocated 10,000 bags of tribute rice to help them, the problem of food is temporarily solved. However, as Mid-Autumn Festival passes and the weather turns colder, the lack of winter clothing for the refugees is a serious problem! Recently, it was reported that Mr. Roosevelt, Chairman of the United China Relief of the United States, issued a second "Bowl of Rice Movement" declaration. He is an American, yet he is so sympathetic. We are compatriots, so how can we bear to sit idly by and not help? Therefore, two days before the festival, I urge those who are preparing to drink and celebrate to forgo your festival banquets and transfer the money for the banquets to help the refugees, so that they may buy winter clothing. It will not affect you much if you eat one less festive meal, but it will be a great act of merit if the refugees receive your gift.

### The Evolution of Socks

— Shen Xishen

Thirty years ago, we still wore cloth socks made by hand. Cloth socks have no elasticity, so they cannot conform to the curves of the feet. When worn, they would bulge in some places and wrinkle in others, making them very uncomfortable! Since foreigners invented yarn socks with fine holes, they have been elastic and comfortable, fitting well and being hygienic. They are extremely convenient! Cloth socks have gradually been eliminated. Today, even in remote rural areas, people wear yarn socks. Those who wear cloth socks are now as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns!

The evolution of socks can now be said to have reached its peak. In terms of materials, there are socks woven from cotton yarn, silk, wool, and rayon, which can be used for different climates. In terms of size, there are socks as small as three or four inches for infants, and as large as more than a foot for the largest feet. In terms of color, there are shades from light to dark, in all kinds of colors. They can also be woven with various patterns and come in long and short lengths. Men, women, old, and young all have their own styles. Civilization has truly progressed, and the feet are fortunate!

The tools for knitting socks have also been improved from hand-cranked machines to electric machines. Each hand-cranked machine can produce up to two dozen pairs of socks per day, while an electric machine can produce up to fifty dozen pairs. Therefore, most of the larger sock factories in Shanghai now use electric knitting machines, while hand-cranked machines have become widespread in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, becoming a household sideline for women. (One can rent a hand-cranked machine from a sock factory and set it up at home.) Although socks made with hand-cranked machines are still beautiful, they are inevitably uneven in elasticity and thickness due to manual labor! Socks made with electric machines will never have these defects.

Whether silk or wool socks, Chinese sock factories can now weave them themselves. Therefore, in recent years, the import of genuine foreign socks has been decreasing, which is gratifying! However, in terms of raw materials, except for silk and some cotton yarn, which can be supplied domestically, other materials such as wool and rayon still need to be imported, which is worthy of our attention.

Recently, there is a new type of sock that has elastic bands woven into the top, so that the legs no longer need to use garters. This is another new evolution of socks.

### Untitled

With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, mooncakes are a seasonal product. This year's mooncakes are extremely expensive, with a single Cantonese-style lotus seed paste mooncake with egg yolk costing 65 cents. However, despite the high price, some people in Shanghai hold the attitude that "seasonal products must be eaten".

After the autumn winds rise, the weather is getting colder day by day. In recent days, the display windows of major companies have been changed to feature new autumn clothes instead of the light summer clothes. Rich people are saying, "We need to buy new clothes again." Poor people are saying, "In addition to food, we now have the problem of clothing."

Liangxiang chestnuts have appeared on the market. Seeing Liangxiang chestnuts cannot help but remind me of "Where is home when the country is broken?" But remembering is useless. It is better to start today, strive to improve ourselves, and become a promising young person.

The poor people's "food" used to be rice, but now it can only be porridge. Recently, it can only be noodles. On the other hand, some rich people have made money off of the national crisis, and now some are making money off of the European war. They can go from eating rice to eating fancy dishes. Alas! This world is truly unfair. (Yong)

### A Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Last week's menu mentioned cooking methods for crabs, suggesting three types: crab in batter, braised crab with greens, and stir-fried crab meat with shredded pork. However, I forgot to mention braised tofu with crab meat. Actually, this is the most economical dish of all. Although prices are soaring, tofu is still relatively cheap. Currently, in Shanghai society, anything that is about seeking cheap and happy things is called "eating tofu". So, why not really eat more tofu, which is both economical and rich in vitamins? When you add tofu to the crab meat, you can use less crab meat. The cooking method is also very simple, and most ordinary families can make it well. The layer of crab oil on top of the soup is so golden and appealing. It tastes delicious when eaten hot, but it's not as good when it's cold, and it has a fishy smell.

Monday

Green vegetable and shredded pork soup, braised tofu with crab meat, plain stir-fried golden needle vegetable, braised sprouted beans

Tuesday Celery with shredded beef, braised sliced carp, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts, fried dough sticks with chicken vegetable

Wednesday Ten-ingredient stir-fried meat with sauce, steamed crucian carp, stir-fried gluten with shrimp roe, sweet bean sauce fried eggplant

### Soybean Powder as a Milk Substitute

— Fan Xiqian

A foreign doctor once treated an infant suffering from anemia caused by drinking goat's milk. He fed the baby 25 to 42 grams of soybean powder daily, and the baby's complexion gradually improved. The anemia was cured in just two weeks. The components of soybeans are rich in blood-building elements, which has been proven to contain large amounts of copper, iron, protein, and vitamin B.

It is common knowledge that iron can produce blood. Recently, some doctors have advocated taking iron and copper together to treat anemia, with greater effectiveness. However, many people experience gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, vomiting, and loss of appetite after taking them, and have to stop taking them midway. If soybean powder is used, there is no such problem.

Soybean powder is a common food in our country, but no one knows that it contains protein and vitamin B, which can cure anemia. The method of making soybean powder is very simple. First, stir-fry the soybeans until they are hot, and then grind them into a fine powder. You can also buy soybean powder on the market to reduce trouble.

When weaning, you can put soybean powder in milk, adding three grams of soybean powder to every 100 grams of milk. Mix well into a thin paste and feed it to children. It is very nutritious. The most economical way is to mix it into tofu soup, which has the same effect. Otherwise, it can be mixed into porridge. For older children, soybean powder and sugar can be used to make various cakes and dumplings.

Using soybean powder as a substitute for milk powder is also very beneficial. First, boil 30 grams of sesame oil in a pot. Then add 30 grams of flour and mix vigorously. Then add 70 grams of soybean powder, 50 grams of white sugar, and 2 grams of salt. Boil until it becomes a paste. The above ingredients are enough for a small child to eat for a day. However, children's physical condition and age vary, so the ratio can be adjusted accordingly. After children use soybean powder as a milk substitute, they should eat 30 grams of fresh fruit juice every day, just like drinking milk powder, so that the nutrition is sufficient.

Now the price of milk powder substitutes is expensive, and the monthly cost is often higher than the cost of hiring a wet nurse, which is a burden for parents. If soybean powder is used as a milk substitute, it is very economical.

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Steel King Schwab

— Weixiao

Mr. Schwab, the American tycoon known as the "Steel King," passed away in New York on the 19th of this month. When Schwab is mentioned, people are immediately reminded of how much the "Steel King's" assets really are. It is estimated to be around 1.2 billion US dollars. However, despite having such a large fortune, Mr. Schwab was a well-known thrifty person. He often said to people: "Money is mankind's great desire, but more money does not necessarily bring happiness. The greatest happiness in life lies in doing good. If someone is diligent and thrifty but not like this, then their happiness will gradually disappear. Therefore, I have experienced happiness in my life that cannot be obtained by money." Here, we can get a glimpse of his personality. Now, let's talk about Mr. Schwab's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and see what they are like.

Clothing

Mr. Schwab has a special characteristic when it comes to clothing, which is that he likes to choose clothes in stores by himself. Because of this, a joke happened about five years ago. One day, Mr. Schwab was wearing very plain, ordinary clothes when he suddenly went to a store to choose clothes. He selected an evening dress worth more than 500 US dollars. It happened that he encountered a young shop assistant who was arrogant and contemptuous. The shop assistant asked Mr. Schwab to pay half of the price as a deposit first, but Mr. Schwab only had a few dozen US dollars with him. How could that be enough? Finally, he asked the shop assistant to deliver the clothes to his home, but the shop assistant didn't believe that this old man was from the "Steel King's" family. How could he know that he was the "Steel King"? As a result, he was rejected. Mr. Schwab was extremely angry and called the store manager when he got home. After explaining the situation, the manager apologized to Mr. Schwab and immediately fired the shop assistant. However, Mr. Schwab couldn't bear it and gave him a position as a staff member in the Mecitolecton steel refinery. With special caution and effort over the years, he is now the import manager of the factory. His name is Weinesoson.

Food

Regarding food, Mr. Schwab did not like mixed foods. Besides the normal Western dishes, he was most fond of fruits, and his life-sustaining tonic was the Dragon Ros瓜 (produced in Gaden, northern United States). This melon is rich in vitamin B, and the car magnate Ford and Secretary of State Hull both loved to eat it. Every week, a light yellow car could be seen speeding on the Newdens Highway. This was a special car from the Ford Motor Factory, going to select and pick Dragon Ros melons to bring back for Mr. Schwab and Ford to eat. However, Mr. Schwab did not like rabbit meat and would never eat it.

Housing

At the eastern end of Oceanus on Broadway in New York, there is a towering 27-story building, which is his private residence. When we see the exterior of this building, which is entirely made of marble and mica, we can estimate how luxurious and valuable the house is. Unfortunately, the gate is heavily guarded on weekdays, so we cannot know exactly what it is like inside.

Transportation

Mr. Schwab was unexpectedly enthusiastic about charitable causes, and the expenses he spent each year were more than three million US dollars. He was most concerned about a large-scale orphanage in Gas Shelipov, northern United States. He liked these innocent children the most. Every summer, he had to go to Jominisun Mountain to escape the summer heat. When passing through here, Mr. Schwab had to stay for at least a week before returning to New York. He liked to play with those children at will. As for when he was in New York, Mr. Schwab often went to Ford's private residence to play racquetball, or the two of them would race dogs in the suburbs. Every month, he had to go to Washington, D.C., because there were many things to discuss with President Roosevelt or Hull. When he was in Washington, he liked to linger in major theaters to watch plays.

### The Post-War Pawn Industry

No damage within the industry, on the contrary, profits were gained. Increasing interest rates beyond reason is against the welfare of the public.

"Pawn," this huge, black character can always be found on the chalk-white walls or the terrazzo Shikumen walls on any street. It's an eye-catching, numbered character: "Pawn" -- it is the source of wealth for the poor and the lifeline of the impoverished class. Isn't that right? In front of that wide doorway, a poor man with a sallow face, carrying a small bundle under his arm, darts into the doorway like a mouse when you least expect it. In a moment, he comes out again with the empty bundle, rushing out in two or three strides, a faint smile barely appearing on his worried face -- such a tense scene plays out several times a day, I don't know how many times!

The "August 13th" artillery fire destroyed the homes of thousands of people. Having lost their reliance in their hometowns, where was their final destination? Therefore, they could only flee to the "isolated island" of Shanghai. The resident capacity of the "isolated island" reached its saturation point! But as time went on, the "refugee capital" that had been accumulated from home was almost used up. The only way to remedy this was to go to the pawnshop, pawn the few things they had, and exchange them for one yuan and a half to maintain a few days of impoverished life. Therefore, the opening of pawnshops in the concessions was like bamboo shoots after a rain, pawnshops were adorned on the streets every five steps and pawnshops every three steps.

Recently, the price of rice has risen to forty yuan per picul, coal briquettes are more than four yuan per load, and everything has risen, risen, and risen several times! Therefore, the pawn industry, under the pretext of "sharp contraction of foreign exchange" and "high cost of everything", announced that it would increase interest rates starting this month.

Their method is: starting from the first of the month, the pawn interest rate will be uniformly increased to two cents. However, in fact, this method is not unified. In the past, the pawn interest rate was 1.6%, some was 1.8%, and some pawnshops even had 3-4%, which has made the poor feel extremely panic. Currently? In this "isolated island" of deep water and scorching heat, the owners of pawnshops are raising the pawn interest rate wantonly. The livelihood of the poor will become even more difficult as a result, which is unnecessary to repeat.

Here, let us turn around and look at the pawn industry. Is it necessary for them to increase the pawn interest rate?

After the war, the pawnshops in the war zone, of course, suffered considerable losses due to the war, which is not within the scope of this article. As for the pawnshops in the concessions? Not only did they not suffer any losses, but on the contrary, they gained many profits. Just take the ornaments in the unredeemed goods as an example. The price of gold before the war was about 100 yuan, but now it has soared several times. Their profit on this alone is considerable. Other unredeemed goods such as clothing, copper, and tin utensils also have quite a lot of profit. Under these circumstances, it is really unreasonable for the pawn industry to increase interest rates. This will not only make the poor feel difficult to make a living, but also affect the peace of society.

For the benefit of the public and the peace of society, I think that increasing the pawn interest rate seems to be unreasonable.

### Three "No's" for Mid-Autumn Festival

— Xing

(1) Stop giving festival gifts: In this year, everything is expensive and life is difficult. It costs at least a dozen yuan to give a minimum festival gift, and it costs even more if you are generous. One person does this, and everyone does this, thinking that "human relations are heavier than debt", and that gifts must be given in return. However, in this special environment of difficult living, the act of giving festival gifts can indeed save money. If you have the power to give festival gifts and it is unavoidable, it is better to use this gift money as a donation to relieve refugees. This is more practical, benefiting both yourself and the recipient of the gift, and refugees can be relieved. The gift-giver and the recipient of the gift will definitely agree and will never lose their original feelings because of this.

(2) Do not burn incense burners: Qi Yue Gong, burning incense burners, is fundamentally a boring and superstitious thing. Burning an incense burner costs at least a few cents for a small one and even several yuan for a large one. The rich, of course, do not think this small amount is strange. However, when this small amount is calculated in total, the annual consumption of burning incense burners alone is as high as tens of thousands of yuan. If the consumption of burning incense burners can be changed to buying warm clothes and donating them to refugees, because the weather is already in autumn, and it is getting colder day by day, the refugees' warm clothes and food are equally urgent and necessary.

Abolish festival banquets: During the three festivals (Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and New Year's Eve), the shopkeeper must invite the shop assistants to eat a table of sumptuous banquets. In the past, both the shopkeeper and the shop assistants felt that this was a waste. Many of the funds for wine and food were used as donations. It is hoped that this can continue to be implemented during this Mid-Autumn Festival. If you eat one less meal of wine and vegetables, the refugees will benefit from it.

In short, regarding the extravagance of this festival, whether it is the gift-giver or the recipient of the gift, whether it is the trade or the residents, if they can self-motivate and self-consciously, on the one hand, they can try their best to save festival expenses, and on the other hand, they are willing to donate and relieve as much as possible. This is also the obligation that the people of the "isolated island" should fulfill for the people and the country.

### Speculation is "Big Fish Eat Small Fish". The Manipulation of Large Capitalists Results in More Losses than Gains. It Is Better to Make a Proper Investment Than to Engage in Speculation.

It is a bad phenomenon during the war: the general public is transferring property from Chinese banks to foreign banks; the general public is taking back capital invested in businesses and putting it at home; the general public is waiting for opportunities to make a business that can easily earn big money. In this phenomenon, there are two factions: one is a miser, and the other is a speculator. To sum up, they are equally afraid that the war will swallow their property, so they take back capital from legitimate businesses. As a result, indigenous industries are gradually declining, and the power of foreign goods is gradually rising. In addition, the manipulation of speculators has made the market fall into extreme chaos, and people's lives fall into extreme panic.

However, speculation does not necessarily lead to wealth, as has been proven by facts. First, speculative business is always "big fish eat small fish." All markets are manipulated by a few large capitalists. The rise and fall of market prices are determined by how much they eat in and spit out, and it is up to them to create opportunities for getting rich by raising waves and spreading rumors for no reason. Second, the fact that imported goods have not been completely cut off makes it impossible for general hoarders to guarantee profits. The soaring price of paper has now fallen. The turbulent price of rice is also falling gradually. Although the price of coal is still rising, it will also fall one day, because the source of white coal has not been cut off. Any abnormally developed business will inevitably have such a consequence. In this process, although a few people make a profit, the number of people who suffer more losses than gains must account for the majority.

If we go and ask the people who run legitimate businesses? Even if it is someone who opens a small shop, he will surely tell you happily: "I made some money this year!" This means that investing in legitimate businesses is much more stable than engaging in speculative business. This is not just empty talk, but a real situation.

Recently, quite a few people have been studying shortcuts to getting rich. This circle has expanded from speculation to wives and grandmothers. They have a headache with business, and they are asking everywhere: "What is the easiest thing to get rich doing?" So they try to buy foreign exchange, hoard rice, and go to silver shops to make gold jewelry. But they have no power, no skill, and are completely at the mercy of others. As a result, when it rises, they hope to earn more; when it falls, they panic that they will suffer a big loss, and hurriedly spit out as much as possible. When you add it all up, it still comes out to be a loss.

Chinese folk has infinite wealth, and China's nature also contains infinite wealth. If it can be widely used, China's economy will be exceptionally consolidated. Of course, we cannot just shout slogans, but we must do it in earnest. We want to explain that the high prices in the border areas are due to the underdeveloped industry. Developing industry in the interior will inevitably obtain great profits under extreme needs. As for the richness of the natives, it may be said to be gold everywhere, waiting for you to discover it.

### The Road to a New Life

— Tianwen

The cry for "relieving refugees" has failed to stimulate the hearing of the wealthy due to the prolongation of the war. Yes, the "isolated island" shows an abnormal development two years after the outbreak of the war. However, on the other hand, many enthusiastic people in the community are still actively trying to relieve them, especially those who care about orphaned and helpless children. For example, the Shanghai Relief Refugee Children's Education and Care Home recently built 28 new houses with the surplus houses of Leshan Temple, which can accommodate more than 500 refugee children. Moreover, based on the experience of disaster relief in the past two years, they know that just "raising" without "educating" will not only fail to maintain the expenses of these "old-age homes," but also develop the laziness of the refugees, making them useless. This is too far from the original intention. Especially children, in their precious golden age, should not sit idly by and allow them to become a group of social parasites in the future. Therefore, the Shanghai Relief Refugee Children's Education and Care Home takes "education" as its principle, so that these orphaned and helpless children can learn a skill and seek a foundation for establishing themselves in society in the future.

Starting yesterday, they have mobilized Shanghai artists to broadcast on six major radio stations in order to "adopt refugee children," "donate educational funds," and "build factories," and to appeal to the wealthy for the sake of the refugee children. It is hoped that the shouts of these enthusiastic artists can stimulate the conscience of the wealthy and complete this good deed.

At the same time, we also hope that donations from all walks of life will be active, so that the Shanghai Relief Poverty Children's Education Institute can expand its scope and enable all the children wandering on the streets of Shanghai to receive good education and embark on their road to a new life.
