### Japanese Troops Land on Hao Island; Fierce Street Fighting Erupts in Shantou; City Engulfed in Flames as Most Residents Evacuate; Strong Defenses Outside Shantou Control the Overall Situation; Foreigners Fear Abuse by Japanese Soldiers and Gather at Quakeshi Awaiting Rescue

(Hong Kong) Foreigners in Hong Kong received a telegram from Shantou reporting that thousands of Japanese army and naval personnel landed in two locations several miles outside Shantou City around 4:00 AM this morning, advancing inland and encountering fierce resistance from Chinese troops. Casualties were heavy on both sides, and fierce fighting is ongoing. At noon, Hong Kong's telecommunications with Shantou, foreign exchange, and cargo transportation were all suspended. Jardine Matheson's "Hosho" and Swire's "Fuzhou" ships were ordered by their companies at 3:00 PM to retreat from Shantou, unload the cargo bound for Shantou, and temporarily cease docking there in the future. The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank in Shantou City had already relocated to Hong Kong, and the Provincial Bank had also moved to the inner city. Most of the foreigners in Shantou are British, with about forty or fifty American expatriates as well. Only the British warship "Danae" is present, and it remains to be seen whether we will send additional warships. Hong Kong naval authorities have not yet made any statement. The fall of Shantou will slightly affect Hong Kong's food supply. According to a military figure in Hong Kong, the loss or gain of Shantou is not significant, as we have already made strong arrangements on the outskirts of Shantou, sufficient to control the overall situation. Even if Japanese troops manage to gain a foothold in Shantou, it will be difficult for them to deploy. (21st Special Telegram)

Chao'an: Japanese warships broke through the blockade line at Mayu Island at around 10:00 AM on the 21st and continued to invade Shantou City. Chinese defenders calmly responded, waiting for the Japanese ships to approach before suddenly opening fire, sinking more than ten Japanese ships. However, under the cover of naval gunfire and aircraft, the Japanese forcibly landed and entered street fighting at 11:00 AM. As of the time of the dispatch, Chinese and Japanese forces were still engaged in fierce combat. (21st Urgent Telegram)

Chao'an: The Japanese invasion of Shantou was expected by the Chinese military. Therefore, the city's residents were evacuated and materials were relocated as much as possible in advance, and fortifications were set up inside and outside the city, preparing to inflict the greatest possible cost on the Japanese through street fighting. Because Shantou is located on the coast, it is within range of Japanese naval gunfire, which can threaten Chinese forces at any time. According to telephone reports from the front, Chinese defenders are currently holding firm in important streets and alleys in the city, fighting the Japanese troops. As of 4:00 PM, fierce fighting was still ongoing. The Chinese military authorities have now deployed reinforcements, and more intense street fighting is expected in Shantou City. (21st Telegram)

(Shantou) Ten Japanese planes suddenly launched a frenzied attack on Shantou City at 5:00 AM on the 21st. At 5:30 AM, more than ten Japanese warships and dozens of motorboats gathered outside Mayu Island, invading Shantou City, immediately engaging in artillery battles with the Chinese coastal defense forces. Under the cover of artillery fire, Japanese motorboats broke through the blockade line at 10:09 AM, and at the same time, hundreds of Japanese soldiers forcibly landed on the eastern shore of Da Hao Island west of Mayu Island. Chinese defenders rose up in resistance, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. (21st Urgent Telegram, 10:30 AM)

(Hong Kong) After Japanese troops landed near Shantou this morning, they continued to advance inland without encountering strong resistance. The Japanese landing was covered by intense artillery fire, and the Chinese military apparently had not prepared in advance. Before the landing, the Japanese detained three British ships (Suiyang, Yisheng, and Mora), warning them not to enter the port. A US destroyer is currently docked in Shantou, and its captain, Mr. Steibora, will arrive in Shantou today. Currently, there are a total of forty American expatriates residing in Shantou. The US warship "Pope" left Hong Kong for Xiamen yesterday, but has now decided to sail to Shantou. At the same time, the US warship "Areyville" docked in Hong Kong is also preparing to sail to Shantou. According to British naval sources, they have not yet received orders to proceed to Shantou. (21st Associated Press Telegram)

(Shantou) British and American merchants here attach great importance to the Japanese invasion of Shantou. Women, children, and most merchants are deeply concerned about being killed by Japanese soldiers, and have gathered at Quakeshi facing the sea in Shantou, eagerly hoping that British and American warships will quickly sail to protect them. According to foreign observers, Shantou is located in a remote corner of the sea, and the Japanese could have invaded at any time. The reason why they waited until today to launch the attack is clearly influenced by the Tianjin British Concession incident, hoping to use this to make further demonstrations against Britain. Shantou is only 188 nautical miles from Hong Kong, and the Japanese navy and air force have long wanted to use it as a base to threaten Hong Kong and its connections with the Philippines. (21st Telegram)

(Hong Kong) According to reports received here, a large contingent of Japanese troops suddenly landed in two teams two miles from Shantou at dawn today, attempting to advance inland. Chinese troops rose up to resist, and both sides suffered heavy losses and are still engaged in fierce fighting. Currently, the foreign residents in Shantou are mostly British, followed by Americans, but only fifty in total. (21st Haitong News Agency Telegram)

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese sources, after Japanese troops landed at two locations in Shantou port this morning, they occupied Shantou City at 2:30 PM today. Another Japanese force advancing north reached Anbu, nine miles north of Shantou, this afternoon. It is reported that before the Japanese landing, all Japanese warships currently in the coastal waters near Shantou subjected the shore to intense shelling. Japanese planes also repeatedly bombed Shantou and Chinese military positions from morning to noon, almost without stopping. However, all foreign nationals currently in Shantou City are very safe. As for the Chinese residents, most have evacuated under the orders of the Chinese garrison. A fire has now broken out in Shantou City, but it is not yet certain whether it is the result of Japanese naval and air bombardment or the result of the Chinese "scorched earth policy." Although Shantou has no concessions, there are many foreign nationals, and in the interior, there are a large number of foreign missionaries. As of this afternoon, six Japanese destroyers were docked in Shantou port, three of which sailed up the river, but remained docked near the Swire and Jardine Matheson wharves. One was docked opposite the Asiatic Petroleum depot. According to an announcement issued today by the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, "Since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou has become an important port for the Chinese side to obtain military supplies from the outside world, and its occupation by the Japanese side will be a blow to Chongqing." The announcement also stated that the first Japanese landing took place at the upper and lower points of Shantou at 4:00 AM, with an initial force of only 350 to 500 men, who first "pacified" the Chinese troops on both sides of the Han River, and then the main force and mechanized units, followed by heavy artillery, landed. Another Japanese force departed from Nan'ao and landed north of Shantou, now advancing north with the intention of cutting off the railway at Huzhou, 27 miles north of Shantou. Since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou has become a relatively important import and export port for China, importing armaments and raw materials, and exporting tungsten and tung oil. (21st Associated Press Telegram)

(Tokyo) According to official announcements, Japanese naval and army units landed in three locations near Shantou before dawn today without casualties. Japanese forces are now rapidly advancing towards Shantou. Naval Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that Japanese transport ships carrying Japanese troops, escorted by the Japanese South China Fleet, arrived at a point outside Shantou at midnight. Japanese troops immediately began landing, and the Navy occupied the islands at 5:30 AM this morning, breaking through Chinese resistance. At 8:30 AM, Japanese ships moved fences and cleared mines, beginning to sail into Shantou port. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the military action undertaken by Japanese forces in South China is an expansion of purely military operations, as in the war being waged since last year, aimed at destroying important bases from which the Chinese government conducts war against Japan. The Japanese government's policy of respecting the rights and interests of third countries remains unchanged. In the current war, while efforts will be made to prevent damage to the rights and interests of third countries, it is hoped that third countries will understand Japan's true intentions and cooperate with the efforts of the Japanese military to prevent any unfortunate events from occurring. (21st Reuters Telegram)

(Hong Kong) According to a Japanese communiqué, Japanese army and naval units landed at two locations near Shantou today, and despite fierce resistance, they are advancing inland. Fighting is currently underway. According to reliable sources beforehand, the Japanese military blocked British ships outside Shantou port, instructing them not to enter the port, which served as a harbinger of the Japanese military action. British ships blocked include Yisheng, Suiyang, and Manli Maru. The British destroyer Snapdragon (905 tons) is currently docked in Shantou, observing the situation. The US ship Pierce Bailey is also there. It is reported that there are currently forty American expatriates in Shantou, with an additional twenty residing inland. The number of British expatriates is also considerable. Furthermore, shortly after 4:00 AM, 300-500 Japanese soldiers first landed in Shantou, and after fierce resistance on both banks of the river, the Japanese troops achieved their objective at 9:00 AM. Transport ships then sailed up the river, with troops and mechanized units disembarking continuously. At the same time, the vanguard is advancing inland on both sides of Shantou, apparently intending to encircle the city and cut off the railway between Shantou and Chaozhou, 27 miles from the coast. (21st Reuters Telegram)

(Hong Kong) According to observations by Chinese sources here, after the fall of Shantou, the second Japanese target in Guangdong may be Shaoguan. According to people in the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce here, although the Chinese side had dispatched 30,000 troops to the Shantou-Chaozhou area during this period, it is feared that effective resistance will be difficult due to the flat terrain. However, Chinese forces on the East River will be able to mount a strong resistance to the Japanese army, preventing the Japanese army from advancing towards Shaoguan. (21st Associated Press Telegram)

(Tokyo) Army Headquarters issued a communiqué this afternoon stating that the vanguard of the Japanese army entered Shantou at 4:30 PM this afternoon. (21st Reuters Telegram)

(Hong Kong) Reports received here state that small boats carrying Japanese soldiers, under the cover of heavy bombardment by Japanese heavy cruisers, sailed into Shantou port. Some say that the Japanese army occupied Shantou between 2:00 and 3:00 PM today. (21st Haitong News Agency Telegram)

(Tokyo) Official announcements stated that Japanese ships entered Shantou port at 8:30 AM this morning after Japanese troops occupied the outer islands of Shantou and removed all sea mines. (21st Reuters Telegram)

(Tokyo) Authorities in this city officially confirmed that Japanese troops completely occupied Shantou at 2:50 PM today. A naval communiqué issued at 7:00 PM stated that the Japanese navy had cleared the port in Shantou at 3:00 PM, removing sea mines, so that Japanese transport ships could enter the port.

Editorial

### Soaring Prices in Shanghai

The millions of Chinese and foreign residents living in the Shanghai concessions are now experiencing two major concerns: First, whether Shanghai's situation will lead to the same coercion experienced in Tianjin and Gulangyu; second, the recent soaring prices of various commodities, which have caused economic panic among ordinary residents, and whether this will deteriorate into overall social and economic chaos. The former issue is of concern to both China and foreign countries because it involves the rights and interests of European and American countries in China; while the latter is still the focus of attention for most people.

We must clearly understand the recent rise in prices of various commodities in Shanghai. This is not entirely the result of drastic changes in black market exchange rates, nor is it the result of inflation in Shanghai currency, nor is it due to an imbalance between supply and demand in the Shanghai market. The Chinese government's cessation of foreign exchange supply in the black market is intended to reduce Shanghai's huge trade deficit and prevent Japan from undermining Chinese finance. As a result, the Shanghai commodity market is affected by foreign goods that require foreign exchange, and is absolutely unrelated to purely domestic goods. As for China's legal tender, it has very sufficient reserves; as far as Shanghai is concerned, there is no phenomenon of inflation at all. These points are naturally not enough to stimulate a general rise in prices. As for the current supply and demand situation of various commodities in the Shanghai market, although some commodities have been controlled by Japan, most commodities do not feel a lack of supply, which can be used as a reason to raise prices. Take domestic rice as an example; according to surveys, Shanghai currently has more than 520,000 bags of rice in stock, and the source has not been blocked. In theory, its price should not fluctuate much; but in reality, the selling price of domestic rice has increased from 16 or 17 yuan per picul to more than 22 yuan within the past ten days. It can be seen from this that the rise in prices in Shanghai cannot but be attributed to the speculative manipulation of a few unscrupulous merchants. They are taking advantage of the rise in prices of foreign goods to deliberately raise the prices of various domestic goods; they are taking advantage of the general public's fear of the situation in Shanghai, thereby exploiting their purchasing power to seek huge profits.

Such speculative behavior is directly enough to threaten the tranquility of the Shanghai concessions. Among the residents of Shanghai, there are many industrial and commercial employees who depend on wages, many refugees who have fled from the interior, and many unemployed people before and after the drastic changes in the Shanghai situation. They have already had a difficult time; and in the sound of rising prices, the rise in prices of daily necessities is the most rapid. This is tantamount to imposing a significant oppression on the difficult lives of the majority of residents. If this situation is allowed to develop freely without active efforts to stop it, it will inevitably lead to major social problems in the future. In 1918, Japan experienced huge riots in the Kyoto and Osaka areas due to rice problems; a few years ago, rice riots also occurred in various parts of Jiangsu. These are all unfortunate incidents caused by the fact that the lives of the general public have problems. This is something that the concession authorities and residents should pay special attention to. Moreover, under the current situation, if unfortunate incidents occur in the concessions due to livelihood issues, they will provide an excuse for those who attempt to seize the concessions to accuse the concession authorities of failing to maintain good law and order, which will further increase the severity of the concession situation.

Since the implementation of the war of resistance against Japan, the Chinese government has promulgated certain penalties for speculators who raise prices; but the current Shanghai is no longer within the reach of the Chinese government's power, and the effectiveness of the law has been weakened. In order to crack down on speculative activities in the concessions, we can only hope that the authorities of the Shanghai concessions and various public legal entities will quickly seek effective remedies; at a minimum, speculators should be sanctioned.

For the sake of maintaining social tranquility, the concession authorities should take effective action to address the livelihood issues of the general residents in the concessions and the economic conditions of society, and may use police power to directly intervene in the rise in prices. It is said that the Public Concession has drafted concrete measures to limit rice prices; it is even more desirable for the two concessions to immediately cooperate to temporarily implement strict control measures for all daily necessities. This was originally effective in the early stages of the war. Now it is just a matter of reiterating old things, in order to make them more rigorous.

At the same time, I hope that the residents of Shanghai will deal with the current difficulties in a calm manner, and do not worry about the continued rise in prices. A large number of state-owned goods are stored, which may instead fall into the trickery of speculators; on the other hand, we also hope that speculators can thoroughly realize that it is immoral to exploit the public and take advantage of the fire; and under the current system of the Shanghai concessions, which has police power and the responsibility of inspection, the concession authorities can initiate the power of inspection to make it possible for unscrupulous merchants who raise prices and disrupt public safety to be punished by law. At that time. Society will never sympathize with unscrupulous merchants!

Escorted by the Japanese fleet in South China, it arrived at a point outside Shantou at midnight. Japanese troops immediately began landing, and the navy occupied the islands at 5:30 AM this morning, breaking through Chinese resistance. At 8:30 AM, Japanese ships moved fences and cleared mines, beginning to sail into Shantou port.

### British Prime Minister Addresses the House of Commons on the Recent Situation in Tianjin; Government Awaits Further Reports; No Decision Yet on Action; Protest Against Discrimination Against British Nationals Explicitly Rejected by Japan

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons today on the latest intelligence regarding the situation in Tianjin, stating that the Japanese side did not appear to be prohibiting the transport of food into the British Concession. In response to several questions from members of Parliament, the Prime Minister stated that the restrictive regulations isolating the Concession remained in effect and had not changed. Four British nationals had been stripped and searched, but the latest telegram from the British Consul-General in Tianjin did not mention any further incidents of this kind. A Japanese news agency announced that the barbed wire barrier surrounding the French Concession had been electrified on the evening of June 19. There are large stocks of rice and flour within the British Concession, and perishable foods are occasionally transported in, but the quantities are far lower than usual. The Japanese authorities claim that all items, such as vegetables, must be inspected in front of the barrier, so the transport of goods into the Concession is greatly delayed. Regarding shipping, everything has improved greatly, and ships sailing on the Baihe River recently have not been intercepted by the Japanese military authorities. When Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, he enumerated various unfortunate incidents that had occurred since the Japanese side implemented the blockade. Arita had agreed to investigate Sir Craigie's complaints about discrimination and abuse of British nationals. The Japanese government's position on the Tianjin dispute remains unclear, so it has not yet been decided whether the dispute will be discussed in Tokyo or in Tianjin. The British government will continue to receive reports on this matter in the next day or two, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister also answered a question from Labour MP Mr. 台, stating that he had heard that British nationals had indeed been subjected to violent treatment by the Japanese, and the government was currently investigating the matter. Labour MP Mr. Henderson asked whether the Prime Minister's answer implied that the Japanese government had not yet clearly stated any grievances it had against Britain, and whether this would make negotiations very difficult. The Prime Minister replied that it was indeed very difficult and that he hoped the Japanese government would state any grievances it had. Former Foreign Secretary Eden asked whether Sir Robert Craigie had explicitly stated in his talks with the Japanese government that the British government was unwilling to tolerate this blockade and that the British government intended to take any steps it deemed necessary to safeguard the food supply for British nationals in the foreign district. The Prime Minister replied that Sir Craigie had stated this and that Sir Craigie had explicitly stated to the Japanese government that we could not tolerate this blockade. The Prime Minister also answered a question from Liberal leader Sinclair, stating that the government was constantly studying the matter of ensuring food supply. Conservative MP Adams asked whether the government had considered the possibility of airlifting food supplies to the British Concession. The Prime Minister replied that the entire situation was currently under consideration and that the most pressing problem to be solved now was where to find food. The Prime Minister also answered other questions, stating that the government had not consulted with the Soviet Union regarding the situation in China, and that some members had asked whether, in view of the seriousness of this morning's news, Mr. Strang's mission to Moscow could be approved to supplement military talks with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. The Prime Minister replied that we must first reach an agreement. The Prime Minister finally answered a question stating that more than the usual number of British troops in North China are currently stationed in Tianjin. (21st Reuters Telegram)

(London) The British Cabinet met at 10:30 AM this morning to study the international situation, with particular attention to British-Japanese relations in North China. However, apart from reviewing diplomatic reports from the Far East, the Cabinet made no decisions on actions. Before a formal response is received in Tokyo regarding the British proposal to negotiate the Tianjin incident as a local matter, no concrete decisions will be made. (21st Associated Press Telegram)

### British Press Comments on Tianjin Incident as an Act of Japanese Challenge

(London) The Daily Mail today commented on the situation in Tianjin, stating that Britain now holds economic leverage, and that the Tianjin incident is an act of Japanese challenge, which is no different from the tactics of unrestricted submarine warfare, poison gas, tearing up treaties, and various other strategies used by a country in a state of serious defeat seeking to win victory. This kind of challenge cannot be compromised with and must be given an extremely firm and clear response. (21st Reuters Telegram)

(London) Sir Archibald Sinclair, the British government's chief legal advisor, said at a Conservative Party meeting in Loughborough today that it was a mistake to say that the blockade of the Tianjin Concession did not threaten the heart of Britain. This threat was largely planned and instigated by those who consider the British Empire to be the greatest obstacle to their dominance of the world. Those who express the above opinions are largely misguided because their relatives and friends in Tianjin have suffered insults and dangers. The habit of Conservative tradition denies the deep conviction that Britain has not surrendered to the kind of threat it is currently facing, nor will it ever surrender. It can only stand strong at any cost. (21st Reuters Telegram)

(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese government has explicitly rejected the British government's protest regarding special discrimination against British nationals in Tianjin and the delayed inspection of food entering the British Concession. It is reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita informed British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie of the rejection yesterday, stating that the Japanese government now supports the attitude and policy plans taken by the Japanese military in Tianjin, and that if Britain does not change its attitude towards the new situation in East Asia, the Japanese government cannot comply with the British government's request. The reaction of various newspapers to the meeting between Arita and Craigie can be seen in the text of its headline. Today's Yomiuri Shimbun headline reads, "British Ambassador Begs for Forgiveness, Arita Gives Serious Warning, Demanding Recognition of the New Situation." The Kokumin Shimbun headline reads, "The Cunning Policy of Great Britain Has Been Broken by the Japanese Government." (21st Reuters Telegram)

### Protest Over Lun Chang Incident; Britain Has Not Yet Received a Response

(London) Foreign Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the British government's protest to the Japanese side regarding the injury and death of Mr. Dinkler, a British employee of the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Pudong, has not yet been answered, which is regrettable. One member asked whether Mr. Butler had read the coroner's report detailing the cause of Mr. Dinkler's death and whether he would obtain immediate satisfaction for this unprecedented atrocity. Mr. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had read the coroner's report and was awaiting an official report. At that time, due attention would be paid to the extremely serious nature of this case. Another member asked the government whether it had expressed any sympathy to Mr. Dinkler's family, but Mr. Butler did not answer. (21st Reuters Telegram)

### US State Department to Publish Full Text of Protests Over Repeated Damage to US Property in China by Japanese Aircraft; Bombing Incidents Number Over 150

(Washington) Mr. Dooman, the US Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo, protested to the Japanese government yesterday over the continued bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft. Secretary of State Hull today confirmed that Mr. Dooman had visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry twice yesterday on the instructions of the State Department, the first time in connection with the current situation in Gulangyu and the second time in connection with the continued bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft. In addition to lodging a protest with the Japanese government regarding the bombing, Mr. Dooman also asked the Japanese government to agree to the publication of several US protests previously made on this issue. Mr. Hull also stated that, to his knowledge, Mr. Dooman's protest did not mention the situation in Tianjin. (20th Reuters Telegram)

(Washington) The full text of the protests repeatedly made by the United States to Japan regarding the bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft will be published by the State Department within days. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there have been more than 150 cases of American property in China being threatened or damaged by Japanese aircraft, of which more than 24 have occurred between June 1 of this year and the present. (20th Havas Telegram)

### Japanese Blockade of Tianjin Merely a Show of Force

(Washington) According to Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, the Japanese blockade of Tianjin is purely a "show of force." Dr. Hu believes that the Japanese will eventually soften their stance and resolve the issue as a local incident. He further stated, "The Japanese are well aware that the war has continued for two years without an end in sight. They also understand that the whole world sympathizes with China, and that Britain, France, and the United States are all providing assistance to China. In order to end the war, the Japanese must shift their focus to Britain. If Britain yields, there will be no problem with other countries." (Reuter, 21st)

(Washington) The "Ming Xing Evening News" has commented on the statement made by Secretary of State Hull yesterday regarding the Tianjin incident, stating that "Japan is taking advantage of the fact that Western European countries are too preoccupied to attend to other matters, and is actively creating its so-called 'New Order in East Asia.' The United States cannot stand idly by. Secretary of State Hull has issued the clearest warning to Japan on this point." (Havas, 20th)

### If the U.S. Strongly Intervenes, Japan Might Temper Its Arrogance

(Paris) Responsible figures here are generally satisfied with the negotiations conducted by the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Mr. Dooman, with the Japanese Foreign Ministry, saying that as a result, the Tianjin incident may be resolved locally. (Havas, 20th)

(Chongqing) U.S. Ambassador Johnson arrived here a week ago via Shanghai from the United States. It is now heard that if the Tianjin situation escalates to a serious extent, Mr. Johnson may soon return to Shanghai to maintain close contact with the latest developments. However, it is believed that he will remain in Chongqing for the time being. (Reuter, 21st)

(Paris) Today, all the newspapers here state that the United States' concern over the Tianjin incident is far greater than generally reported. "Le Figaro" reports that the United States is now paying closer attention to the situation in Tianjin than most people imagine. After the end of the European War, Britain did not hesitate to sacrifice its alliance with Japan out of respect for and to reconcile with the United States. The United States will not forget this. "The Times" reports that the protest lodged by Washington with Tokyo is said to be worded extremely sternly. "Le Journal" states, "Our responsibility is quite simple: we should absolutely do our utmost to help our British friends." (Reuter, 21st)

(Paris) Yesterday, diplomatic sources here told reporters, "Only strong intervention by the United States can force Japan to abandon all actions that damage the rights and interests of third parties in China. The attitude of the United States is also the decisive factor in resolving the Tianjin incident. If the United States adopts a policy of non-intervention, Japan will definitely take action against other foreign concessions in China." (Associated Press, 21st)

(Paris) Here, all developments in the Tianjin situation are still of great concern. French political circles attach great importance to the attitude of the U.S. government, saying that everything depends on the U.S. government. It is still hoped that the dispute can be resolved locally, but if it fails, Britain, France, and the United States should immediately take a firm stance. In the opinion of French figures, in addition to Tianjin, the diplomatic situation has become difficult. The final success of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is now considered certain. The Franco-Soviet Pact is expected to be announced at the end of this week. General Pétain, the French Ambassador to Spain, has returned to Beijing from Burgos and has had lengthy discussions with Foreign Minister Bonnet regarding the situation in Spain. The guaranteed neutrality and independence of Spain are greatly welcomed here. The thorny issue of Spain's debt to France is expected to be resolved within a few days. Spain will then repatriate its refugees in France. There are many rumors regarding the movements of German troops in Bohemia, Moravia, and the Siegfried Line, but at present, no definite information has been received. It is impossible to determine whether these people are being used as scapegoats or whether they intend to exert pressure on their neighbors. (Reuter, 20th)

### Foreign Women and Children Leaving; Tianjin British Concession Business Groups Mobilized; Vegetable Shortage Persists

(Tianjin) Today, eighty foreign women and children left Tianjin on the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s "Xianghe" steamer. This is the first group of foreigners to leave Tianjin since the blockade of the concessions. After arriving in Tanggu, all the passengers will transfer to Jardine Matheson's "Wen Sheng" and Taikoo's "Shengjing" steamers to go to Qinhuangdao. When the "Xianghe" steamer passed through the Japanese inspection point at Dalian Wharf, it was not stopped. A radio message has now been received reporting that it arrived in Tanggu safely. The departure of this group of foreign women and children by steamer to various summer resorts was specially arranged to avoid possible difficulties or unpleasant incidents that might occur if they traveled by train. The climate in Tianjin has been very hot recently, and this measure is considered essential for children. The situation in Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe is quite peaceful, and the food supply is quite sufficient, but due to the prolonged drought, there is a severe shortage of drinking water. Last night, the business groups of the British Concession in Tianjin were ordered to mobilize for alert, so the tense situation has eased slightly. At present, the members of the group are all at the headquarters, ready to depart, but they have not yet been assigned to patrol the streets. The authorities have remained silent about the reasons for mobilizing the business groups, but some observers believe that this is related to the rumors that the Japanese have new intentions towards the British Concession, which were sparked by the Japanese relaxing the restrictions at the inspection points for one hour last night. The British Concession's business groups number over a hundred people, most of whom are British and Russian nationals. Nationals of other countries account for only a small minority. It is heard that an emergency auxiliary team, composed exclusively of British nationals, is now being organized. The team members will carry only batons and will not carry weapons or wear uniforms, but only armbands. These auxiliary team members have not yet been ordered to mobilize, but have registered with the British authorities so that they can be called up immediately in the event of an emergency. There are now rumors that undesirable elements may have infiltrated the concession. The British Municipal Council has sent a letter to the managers of various British commercial firms, urging them to encourage their employees to register to join the auxiliary team. Judging from the remarks made today by Mr. Ti Bo, the Chairman of the British Municipal Council, the Japanese plan to intimidate the council's employees has not produced the desired results so far. According to Mr. Ti Bo, only one of the council's 700 constables has resigned because he feared that his family living outside the concession would be persecuted. Although the business groups have been ordered to assemble, patrols in the British Concession are still being carried out by British troops. Concession constables are also performing special duties in various streets and at various entrances and exits. The residents of the concession do not believe the news published in a certain Japanese newspaper here that vegetable vendors held a meeting and decided to boycott the British Concession and only sell their products in Japanese-controlled areas. They believe that this is a habitual tactic of the Japanese to foreshadow new methods of dealing with the concession. The meaning is that the Japanese will redouble their efforts to intercept any small amount of vegetables entering the concession, so as to make the residents trapped in the concession feel even more unpleasant. The British escort vessel HMS Lowestoft (990 tons), which was originally scheduled to set sail this morning, is temporarily moored here, which is a great comfort to the people. The situation on the border of the British Concession is quite calm today. The number of Chinese people lining up waiting for inspection is very small. The situation in the vegetable markets in the concession is still extremely bleak. Only a small number of rotten vegetables and poultry are on sale. Other meats are completely absent. (Reuter, 21st)

(Tokyo) When the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reporters today, he denied that there were any discriminatory actions against the British in front of the Japanese barriers in Tianjin. It is claimed that all nationals are treated equally, and dealt with according to the merits of the individual. Searches are necessary to confirm that the British are not carrying weapons or bombs. The Japanese military authorities, from a humanitarian point of view, "will naturally do their best to allow food and supplies to pass, but they must be searched." (Reuter, 20th)

(Beiping) The anti-British movement in North China, instigated by the Japanese authorities and the Chinese puppet regime under Japanese control, continues to spread. It is reported that an anti-British mass meeting will be held in Beiping on Friday, and Japanese "reservists" will also participate. At the same time, various newspapers in this city under Japanese control are vehemently attacking Britain in every possible way. (Reuter, 21st)

(Tianjin) A week has passed since the foreign concessions in Tianjin were subjected to extremely strict isolation. During this period, very little food has been allowed to enter the concessions. However, yesterday, a detachment of the British Royal Northumberland Fusiliers safely passed through the blockade line. A truck, guided by a detachment of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, left the concession and entered the Japanese-controlled area, and returned with a large batch of vegetables from the countryside. These items are now severely lacking in the concession. Late last night, the members of the British Concession's business groups were ordered to prepare for immediate deployment. Since the arrival of HMS Sandwich (1045 tons), there have been two British warships here, the other being HMS Lowestoft (990 tons), which was originally scheduled to set sail today, but has now cancelled due to the tense situation here. The anti-British movement is still in full swing and shows no signs of abating. A recent development is that innkeepers in the Japanese-controlled area have posted notices requiring the British to leave the concession and stating that Chinese who leave the British Concession and stay in the inns will receive a 50% discount. The food situation in the British and French concessions is still very worrying. The Japanese are now focusing on the milk supply. The entry of milk into the concession is being completely blocked. The concession also feels a lack of coal. There is a large amount of coal stored in the Japanese-controlled area across the Baihe River, but the Japanese are preventing it from being transported into the concession. A British national, Mr. Smith, was detained by the Japanese on Saturday for arguing with a Chinese policeman, and has not yet been released. The British community is extremely resentful of this matter, especially the members of the Veterans of the European War Association, as Mr. Smith is also a member. The British Consul-General, Mr. Ramsom, has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese to urge his release, but has not been successful. The inspection in front of the barriers outside the concession was slightly relaxed today, reportedly due to the Dragon Boat Festival, but the British do not see this as a sign of a major improvement in the situation. (Reuter, 21st)

(London) "The Times" comments today that the situation in Tianjin remains chaotic due to the attempt by the Japanese military authorities in North China to turn a local accidental event into a dispute over general policy. The trends and objectives of Japan's China policy have long been uncertain. The future development of this dispute is highly speculative. The recent remarks made to the press by U.S. Secretary of State Hull indicate that the U.S. government, while not directly involved in the Tianjin dispute, is very concerned about the broadest aspects of the incident. The newspaper concludes by saying that the Tianjin incident itself is clearly a matter of direct concern to Britain and Japan, but its gradual unfolding into a general movement against foreign concessions and treaty rights in China will lead to an expansion of the scope of opposition to Japanese policy far beyond what the Japanese military may be able to comprehend.

### U.S. Consul-General in Tianjin Protests to Tashiro

(Tianjin) The U.S. Consul-General in Tianjin, Mr. Goteway, today specifically lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Mr. Tashiro, regarding the Japanese interference in the actions of American nationals. In the letter of protest, the U.S. Consul listed various grievances and inconveniences suffered by American nationals in Tianjin, and stated that the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession not only caused great inconvenience to American nationals, but also caused great losses to American merchants. In addition, Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and U.S. Consul-General Goteway paid a return visit to the British Consul and military authorities in Tianjin. According to sources from the U.S. consulate, Admiral Yarnell discussed the Tianjin issue with the British side. At around 1:00 p.m., Admiral Yarnell went to Qinhuangdao to board his flagship, the USS Augusta. Furthermore, the British attitude has recently hardened. Regarding Mr. Smith, who was previously injured in the head by a puppet Chinese policeman using a pistol butt and is now being detained by the Japanese, the British side in Tianjin has lodged a "final demand" with the Japanese. In his "final demand," the British Consul-General in Tianjin stated that if Mr. Smith is not released immediately, this issue will no longer be a local incident and London will take appropriate steps.

### Japanese Aircraft Bombing Chongqing and Chengdu Damaged; 17 Aircraft Shot Down; Overseas Chinese Donate Aircraft for Combat Use

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese report today, as a result of the Japanese aircraft bombings of Chongqing and Chengdu on June 11, it has now been ascertained that the number of Japanese aircraft damaged by the Chinese side reached as many as seventeen. As for how many Japanese aircraft were destroyed in Chengdu, it is not yet possible to know completely. It is heard that the most famous achievements in the Chinese Air Force's combat record are mostly due to aircraft donated by overseas Chinese. For example, of the fifteen Chinese aircraft that fought with Japanese aircraft over Chongqing recently, most were purchased with funds donated by overseas Chinese. In recent air battles, no fewer than eight Japanese aircraft, each worth more than one million legal tender (Chinese currency), were shot down by overseas Chinese aircraft. It is heard that of these dozen or so overseas Chinese aircraft, two were donated by overseas Chinese in Cuba, three were donated by overseas Chinese in Burma, two were donated by overseas Chinese in Peru, one was donated by overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, three were donated by overseas Chinese in San Francisco, one was donated by overseas Chinese in New York, one was donated by overseas Chinese in Canada, and three were donated by the military and civilians of Guangdong. Furthermore, among these dozen or so overseas Chinese aircraft, the most glorious achievements were made by the "Siam No. 2" piloted by Huang Tianming (transliteration), the "New York" piloted by Liang Tiancheng (transliteration), and the "Canada" piloted by Zhou Jinshuo (transliteration), all of whom have shot down Japanese aircraft. It is heard that the names of most overseas Chinese aircraft are named after the country or place of donation. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Chinese Army in Northern Henan Recovers Neihuang

(Zhengzhou) Several hundred Japanese and puppet troops in the Shanyidian area of northern Henan were completely wiped out after days of fierce attacks by the Chinese army.

(Xingji) More than 3,000 Japanese cavalry and artillery troops moved from Datong to Nanguan (belonging to Wu乡) on the evening of the 15th and then invaded south in three routes, attempting to attack Wu乡 and Qin County. One route advanced from Shigongpan (about 20 li east of Nanguan) towards Quantian Gucheng, one route advanced from Shimen Village (more than 10 li southwest of Nanguan) towards Louzidi, and one route advanced south along the Baijin Highway. They are now engaged in fierce fighting with a certain unit of the Chinese army south of the Fen Shuiling (south of Nanguan Town).

### British Government Assists China; Continued Guarantee of Legal Tender; Simon Answers Questions from Labor Members

(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Mr. Bellenger, a member of the opposition Labor Party, raised a question regarding the depreciation of Chinese legal tender. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon immediately replied that the Hong Kong side had already issued a statement on this matter and that he had nothing to add. Mr. Bellenger then followed up by asking whether the British government would guarantee Chinese legal tender, as it was being attacked by the Japanese side. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon replied that the government's intention was to assist China in guaranteeing legal tender, which he believed Mr. Bellenger was also aware of. (Havas, 20th)

### Chinese Army on Dongfan Island Moves Positions

### British and French Generals Gather in Singapore; Far East Joint Defense Conference Opens; Discussion of Various Issues of Military Cooperation; Abnormally Tight Security Around the Venue

(Singapore) The important defense conference to be held here tomorrow will discuss the adjustment of British and French military strategies in the Far East. The British representatives will include Admiral Noble, Commander of the China Fleet, and naval officers from India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, and Hong Kong. The French representatives will include Admiral Decoux, Commander of the Far East Navy, and others. A total of sixty officers will attend. In view of the recent developments in China, it is natural for the general public to consider this conference to be of great significance. (Reuter, 21st)

(Singapore) Admiral Decoux, Commander of the French Far East Fleet, and his entourage, together with General Marley, Commander of the Annam Army, and Colonel Devitzy, Commander of the French Far East Air Force, arrived here today on the French warship "Bégùe." British naval officers went to the harbor to welcome them. After arriving in port, Admiral Decoux and his entourage immediately visited Singapore Governor Thomas. Furthermore, British executive officers here held a preparatory meeting at Fort Canning today. The Anglo-French talks will open tomorrow, at which time security will be set up around the venue to maintain secrecy. Anyone who is not participating in the conference will be refused entry to listen in. As for the issues to be discussed, they will likely remain a secret throughout. However, according to reliable sources, the issue of French warships using Singapore's military port as a base for themselves and for other friendly nations, and for repairing damaged warships, will be discussed. In addition, the issue of mobilizing military resources in the event of war in the Far East will be studied (it is heard that military resources and food are currently stored in large quantities in Singapore). Furthermore, the issue of improving the equipment of the Annam Army, the issue of expanding the defense works of the Annam Cam Ranh Bay military port, and the results of the recent British and French naval exercises held separately in Singapore and elsewhere will also be presented for discussion. Other issues such as the Tianjin issue, the unification of command of the British, French, naval, land, and air forces in the Far East with Singapore as the base, how to deal with the superior Japanese navy when taking retaliatory action against Japan, the issue of defending Hong Kong, the position of the United States, Siam, and the Dutch East Indies in the Far East military strategy, and the issue of protecting merchant ships are all on the agenda.

### Franco-Japanese Conclusion: Trade Agreement

(Paris) Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has rigorously controlled foreign exchange. French trade with Japan has shifted from surplus to deficit.

According to responsible sources, France's proposal has been accepted by Japan, and a trade agreement is about to be concluded. According to this proposal, the Japanese government has agreed to increase its annual purchases of French goods to restore the balance of trade between the two countries. This is of great benefit to the French export industry. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

With this preparedness and the reserve armaments manufactured by various factories, our preparation to weather the critical transitional period will be the most thorough in our history.

### Three-Power Anti-Aggression Agreement: Favorable Progress in Anglo-Soviet Negotiations, Britain Eager to Reach Compromise with Soviet Union, Soviet Union Denies Insistence on Guaranteeing the Far East

(Moscow) Regarding the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov is scheduled to continue talks with French Ambassador Naggiar, British Ambassador Seeds, and British Foreign Office Central European Department Director Strang at 6:00 PM today. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

(London) Today, Reuters diplomatic correspondents stated that well-informed sources here have a more favorable view of the progress of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's recent memorandum has been studied and finalized, and it is believed that the views of both sides are close to agreement. If there are no unexpected developments during the next meeting between the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union, British Foreign Office representative Strang, and Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov, both sides will indeed have a good opportunity to remove all differences of opinion in principle. If a compromise can be reached, it will be followed by drafting the details, which may take some time to complete. In short, well-informed sources are quite optimistic about the prospects. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

(London) Sources close to the government here recently declared that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have now entered a decisive stage. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic countries this morning and decided to accept France's proposal. In essence, if the vital interests of one of the three countries—Britain, France, and the Soviet Union—are threatened, the other two countries should provide mutual assistance. This proposal differs from the one proposed by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in only one respect: the Soviet Union insists that the names of the Baltic countries should be explicitly mentioned, while Britain and France suggest leaving them out. Since the Baltic countries have stated that they do not want to be guaranteed, it is not convenient to force them to accept it. Britain has therefore decided not to explicitly provide guarantees to those countries. The Soviet Union's sincerity in concluding an agreement can be seen in whether it accepts the new proposal from Britain and France. In addition to this, key issues such as the Soviet Union's request for immediate staff talks have been resolved. The British government has ordered its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to speed up negotiations in the hope of reaching an agreement as soon as possible. According to reliable sources in Berlin and Moscow, Germany is using the bait of concluding a non-aggression pact, a trade agreement, and even a "Baltic Locarno" to induce the Soviet Union to maintain a neutral position. However, it is said that Hitler still harbors suspicions about the Soviet Union and has only allowed Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to try to break through the "Eastern European front" with diplomatic tactics. The proposals Germany has made to the Soviet Union are only informal. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its position, except to put them on file. Because of all this, the British government is eager to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to prevent Germany from reaping the benefits. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

(Moscow) German newspapers have recently published news that the Soviet government insisted on guaranteeing the Soviet Union's Far Eastern borders during negotiations with Britain and France, and that this claim is an obstacle to the conclusion of an agreement. TASS is authorized to declare that the above news is completely fabricated and has no basis in fact. (TASS dispatch on the 20th)

(Berlin) German newspapers have recently reported that the Soviet Union once asked Britain to accept a guarantee clause in writing, so as to implement it in the event of war in the Far East. Although this statement has been denied by both British officials and the Soviet TASS news agency, the German News Agency still takes this as its word, adding the comment that Britain's own denial is not enough, and now it is inciting the Soviet government to issue a denial. It is said that German newspapers did not involve the words "guaranteeing the Soviet Far Eastern border," only saying that the Soviet Union asked Britain to accept in writing to provide assistance to the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union goes to war with Japan. As it is, Anglo-Soviet negotiations have reached a stalemate, and Anglo-Japanese relations have suddenly become tense due to the Tianjin incident. The difficulties encountered by British foreign policy are increasing day by day. "It must be known that Britain is unable to do anything about the Tianjin incident, how can it help the Soviet Union in the Far East?" (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

### Anglo-Soviet Staff Talks Can Be Implemented As Soon As Agreement Is Reached, Prime Minister Chamberlain Answers Questions from Parliamentarians

(London) Several members of the House of Commons today asked the government if it had consulted the Soviet government on the situation in China. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied in the negative. Opposition Labour Party member Wedgwood then asked, "The news that came this morning is quite serious. I wonder if the Prime Minister can allow our staff to conduct talks with the Soviet staff as soon as possible to supplement the mission of Strang, Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office." The Prime Minister immediately replied that this could only be implemented after the Anglo-Soviet agreement was concluded. Liberal Party member Mander asked if the Anglo-Franco-Soviet agreement was intended to be extended to the Far East, to which Foreign Secretary Butler replied in the negative. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

### German Delegation Arrives in Moscow to Promote Trade Relations

### Germany Builds Forts on Polish Border, Eager to Seize Danzig, Holy See Envoy to Warsaw Returns Home to Report for Duty, Related to Promoting German-Polish Relations

(Berlin) German National Socialist sources announced last night that the Propaganda Minister's fierce speech in Danzig this week showed Germany's new effort to reach a comprehensive solution with Poland. This solution will be faster than most people expect. According to reliable sources, Germany has begun to step up the construction of fortifications on the Polish border, and the German army has also completed its concentration on the Polish border. Although this report has been denied by the German side, it is widely believed to be reliable. Hitler is currently in Obersalzberg, while diplomats here are paying close attention to various issues related to Polish relations (Associated Press dispatch on the 21st)

Danzig: The Danzig National Socialist Party's newspaper "Volksstimme" published a long article yesterday to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's acquisition of power in the Danzig Senate, with the title "Today is the Last Period of Danzig's Independence Forcibly Created by the Treaty of Versailles." The general idea of the full text is: "Leader Hitler must keep his promise, regardless of the opinions and plans of anti-German countries, sooner or later he will return Danzig to Germany. The determination of the citizens of Danzig and their political beliefs have matured to date. They have never lost their courage and discipline and are always ready to sacrifice for the benefit of Germany. We are currently awaiting the arrival of the final decision period to amend Danzig's current independent status as revenge for destroying the Versailles system." (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)

### India's Population Soars, Food Becomes a Problem

(Geneva) Indian Labor Representative Sir Nas, in his speech at the International Labor Conference yesterday, gave a detailed account of the Indian government's economic construction. According to him, the Indian government has achieved excellent results in the development of irrigation work and the improvement of soil and animal husbandry technology. The government pays attention to the food problem, but because of the large population, the increase in food is difficult to achieve significant results. It is predicted that within a few years, India's population may reach a huge number of 400 million, so various problems arise in how to maintain an appropriate standard of living for the people's diet and daily life. The Indian government is racking its brains on how to deal with it. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)

### Chengdu Bombed by Japanese Planes, Chinese Air Force Shoots Down Three Japanese Planes, Heavy Damage to Civilian and Commercial Areas

Chengdu Air News: The Japanese army began to bomb Chongqing on May 3. Following this, on the evening of the 11th of this month, 27 heavy bombers indiscriminately dropped explosive and incendiary bombs on civilian and commercial areas in Chengdu, attempting to destroy the city of Rong. The situation is recorded as follows:

Alarm Sounded

The weather on the 10th was very clear, with a clear sky and no clouds. From the morning, people felt the danger of an air raid, and many people temporarily evacuated. At 5:30 PM, Chengdu received a report that 27 Japanese planes were flying west from Badong, Hubei, and appeared to be entering Sichuan. At 5:40 PM, another report was received that three groups of Japanese planes, each with 27 planes, were spotted somewhere. Two groups passed through the territory of Fengjie and Kaijiang counties, and one group continued to fly west. Chengdu then issued a preliminary warning. At 6:30 PM, 27 Japanese planes passed over , and Chengdu issued an air raid warning. At 7:10 PM, Japanese planes passed over , and Chengdu issued an emergency warning. At 7:30 PM, 27 Japanese planes, in a single line, invaded the city's airspace from the northeast, indiscriminately dropping explosive and incendiary bombs in civilian residential and commercial areas, and then headed southeast . The alarm was lifted around 8:00 PM.

Fierce Air Combat

When the Japanese planes approached the city's airspace, several squadrons of the brave Chinese Air Force had already soared into the clouds, waiting in battle formation. When the 27 Japanese planes flew in, the Chinese Air Force immediately rushed to intercept them. The Japanese planes were panicked and dared not engage in battle. After dropping the bombs indiscriminately, they tried to escape. The Chinese Air Force tracked and pursued them, and a fierce air battle broke out in the southeast of the city. The Chinese Air Force bravely chased and killed them, rushing into the Japanese fire net, attacking back and forth, and often shooting down three Japanese planes. After chasing for a considerable distance, the Chinese air squadron safely returned to defense.

Blood Feuds and Fires of Hate

The Japanese planes indiscriminately dropped explosive and incendiary bombs in this attack on Chengdu. Many places in Yanshi Intersection and streets caught fire. These areas are all civilian residential and commercial areas and have no military significance. West China University, which is run by foreigners, was also bombed, and Mrs. Li, the president of the Baptist Church, was injured. Flames soared in the disaster area, and corpses and flesh flew everywhere. On the tops of walls and under telegraph poles, severed limbs were still bleeding. Women and children who were crushed and injured were crying in the fire. A young woman, holding her child with a broken arm and abdomen, sat in the blood and fire, crying and calling for revenge. In the smoke and flames, the old, weak, women, and children cried in each other's arms, watching their property burn to ashes. They were homeless. The fierce flames and poisonous fire burned until 3:00 AM on the 12th before being extinguished. Countless houses in the disaster area were turned into rubble. At 7:30 PM that night, when the Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed and the fire reached the sky, fire-fighting teams and paramedics rushed into the area to risk their lives to put out the fire and rescue people. The carrying teams, dismantling teams, investigation teams, comfort teams, rescue teams, and patrol teams all worked in an orderly manner, rescuing the injured, suppressing the fire, dismantling houses, and guarding the belongings of the citizens, staying up all night, fully demonstrating a tight organization. Huang Shebo, a brave company commander, and more than 20 soldiers were directing traffic outside Xiaomen when they were hit by bullets and injured. Several female workers from the provincial party headquarters were burned beyond recognition while rescuing refugee children.

Officials Offer Condolences

That night, Deng Xihou, chief of the Sichuan-Kangsuo Pacification Headquarters, Wang Zuanxu, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Qu Yingguang, vice chairman of the Central Relief Committee, Huang Jilu, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters, and various military, government, and police officials immediately set out separately to the streets and alleys of the affected areas to supervise the protective personnel, implement emergency rescue, and visit the disaster-stricken compatriots in the affected areas on the 12th.

Emergency Relief

Regarding the follow-up work such as relief and burial, the party, government, military agencies, and various rescue organizations were still actively working as of the evening of the 12th. The party, government, and military convened an emergency joint meeting on the afternoon of the 12th and resolved that the protection teams, rural service teams, military control, and military camp contingents should be responsible for actively sweeping the rubble on the streets, filling in the bomb damage, and moving the unexploded bombs. The municipal government and the Highway Bureau should control vehicles and strictly prohibit raising prices to facilitate evacuation and inform the merchants to immediately evacuate goods to the countryside to preserve material resources. Shelters were set up for the victims who were homeless. The injured were rushed for treatment, and the dead were quickly buried. Yang Quanyu, the mayor of Chengdu, and Yan Xiaohu, the garrison commander who were training somewhere, have returned to Chengdu on special leave to handle the aftermath and relief work. The bereaved families of the dead will be compensated with 30 yuan, the seriously injured will be compensated with 20 yuan, and the slightly injured will be compensated with 5 to 10 yuan. From the 12th, funds have been allocated by the Central Relief Committee and will be handled by the Chengdu Emergency Relief Joint Office. The dead who are unclaimed have been buried by the government with coffins. The Chengdu Municipal Government has formed two major teams of disaster area workers.

On the morning of the 12th, they went to the disaster area to conduct investigations and condolences, and sent personnel to the four major hospitals of Chengdu Fucheng, Cunren, and Shensici Ping'an Bridge Beimen Catholic Church to express condolences to the injured people, investigating the dead and victims. All street lights and streets were completely restored to order on the evening of the 12th.

Active Construction

Since the government actively carried out evacuation, the countryside in each evacuation area began to prosper. Many working people are rushing to build houses there. After the air raid on the 11th, thousands of citizens, young and old, moved to the countryside overnight. Young men and women are scattered in bamboo forests and rice paddies. In small thatched cottages, modern small restaurants are open. The songs of resistance against the war echo in the green waves of rice seedlings. The countryside is actively building and rapidly prospering. (June 12)

### Before Shantou Fell, Japanese Warships Tentatively Tried to Land, Dozens of Fishing Boats, Motorboats, and Rubber Boats, Approaching Gezhoushan Bay Were Repelled, Rumor Says Japanese Army Attacking by Taking Advantage of Rising Han River Water

Shantou Communication, 13th: Japanese warships outside Mayu Port suddenly increased to seven, and electric boats, armed speedboats, etc. increased to two or thirty, tentatively trying to land outside ChengHai Nanbei Port Mayu Port. At 9:00 AM on the same day, six Japanese planes flew along the coast to scout and attacked Shantou and Chao'an in the rain. Near the Yixi Railway Station outside the North Gate of Chao'an, four bombs were dropped. The north embankment was unharmed. The bombs fell in the fields, causing very little damage. At 4:00 PM, two more Japanese planes flew into the city's airspace and dropped four bombs, which fell near Tongji Road Beihai, destroying several empty houses. The Shantou military and police moved out along the coast in the rain in the evening. Around 6:00 PM, a Japanese patrol ship, two destroyers, and two transport ships moved to the vicinity of Haimen Bay outside Mayu Port, put down sixteen motorboats, and looked for a landing point. The Chinese military and police hid in the soil caves early and did not make a sound. At 7:00 PM, it was dark and the light rain continued. The Japanese side sent out five armed fishing boats, sixteen motorboats, and two or thirty rubber boats, rushing towards the vicinity of the Mayu Port blockade line, releasing smoke screens, spreading a thick fog on the water. The ships fired remotely, using shells to indicate targets. The motorboats were full of Japanese soldiers. When they rushed close to Gezhoushan Bay, the seabed was full of reefs, and the Japanese boats could not get close. They opened machine guns and bombarded the rocks. The Chinese army also returned fire with guns and cannons. Until the 14th morning, five or six Japanese boats were sunk, and many Japanese soldiers drowned and became food for sharks. The residents of Shantou heard the gunshots very clearly. If the Japanese army had succeeded in landing in Gezhou and Dahu, there would have been a fierce battle. That night, the women and children of the coastal villages mostly climbed mountains to Jiaoshi to take refuge in the dark and rain. On the morning of the 14th, the fighting did not stop. Foreign ships temporarily stopped entering and leaving. The authorities stepped up the forced evacuation of the people and managed the teams (that is, the citizens were formed) with military laws, and controlled food and ships. It is expected that the battle of Shantou will start near the shore at any moment. Also, before dawn on the 14th, an air raid alarm was issued. Men, women, old and young left the city in panic amid cries of alarm. According to rumors in the city, the Japanese army plans to take advantage of the rising Han River water to invade Meipu and use rubber boats to penetrate deep above Songkou. The authorities issued announcements to reassure the people to avoid panic.

### Zhejiang Traitors Fight Each Other

Replacement of Puppet Police Chief

Hangzhou Communication: Chen Bingjun, the puppet police chief of Zhejiang Province, and the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province were at odds with each other. He then made an excuse to transfer Chen elsewhere and replaced him with Wu Hong, the former puppet guard section chief and acting chief. Chen was very unwilling and sneaked to Nanjing, to the puppet pacification department secretary Liang Xiaocheng (Liang Hongzhi's son), pointing out the various acts of transgression by Zai. Liang suddenly dismissed Wu and replaced him with Shang Rongzhou. Shang has come to Hangzhou to take office. Their struggle for power and profit is evident. Gangs of thieves are as numerous as hair in the downtown areas of the city.

### Wuxi Japanese Army Induces Ignorant Young People

Gangs of Thieves as Numerous as Hair in the Downtown Areas of the City

Wuxi Communication: The Japanese army suffered military defeats on the front line, with many deaths and injuries, and it was extremely difficult to replenish them. They had no choice but to forcibly conscript young men from the occupied areas and press them to fight on the front lines. Among the young people who were forcibly conscripted in Wuxi were the clerks of mountain goods shops. Recently, they formed the so-called "Anti-Communist Youth League," using all kinds of inducements to get ignorant teenagers to join, engaging in training and military activities. However, very few people joined. Robberies have occurred in the city for days, and residents are uneasy. On the afternoon of the 16th, Xu Zeng, a woman from Nanzha Township, Jiangyin, received 80 yuan for silkworm cocoons at the "Silk Cocoon Office" in the city, packed it in a shoe box, and wanted to take a small steamer back to her hometown. Passing through Guangfu Gate Taiping Bridge, she was robbed by three robbers. Also, at the HuaCheng oil company at Changan Bridge, at 9:00 PM, it was also robbed, losing two or three hundred yuan. Gangs of thieves are as numerous as hair in the city and the countryside, and the Japanese puppets have difficulty coping with them.

### Kunshan's Opium and Gambling Are Rampant

Kunshan Communication: Under the rule of the puppet organization, opium and gambling are extremely prevalent in Kunshan. The puppet opium suppression director is Gao Jixian, who uses opium suppression as a name to sell opium in reality. Therefore, opium dens are lined up in the city, and business is booming. All those who open opium dens must pay donations. The donation rate is divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A is 30 yuan per month, Type B is 20 yuan per month, and Type C is 10 yuan per month. Opium addicts must also register with the puppet bureau. If they are found smoking privately without a certificate, they will be severely fined. Therefore, the puppet bureau's income is very high. The gambling hall is presided over by a rogue. The puppet police do not interfere because they have subsidies. Ordinary ignorant farmers flock to it. The other day, Jin Zhixi, a villager from Jing Village outside the North Gate, because he was repeatedly defeated, threw all the hard work he had earned in a year into the gambling hall, and committed suicide out of anger. The intensity of its harm can be imagined.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern: After the Kunshan communication in your newspaper on the 19th was published, the members of our association and fellow villagers inquired about the situation from our association. Our association sent personnel to investigate. Now, the fellow villagers who came to Shanghai from Pinghu on the 19th have proven that there is no such thing. However, it is true that the people are ashamed and humiliated under violence because of their lives. We are hereby sending this letter to your newspaper, hoping that you will publish this letter as a correction. We are extremely grateful for your fairness. Sincerely, Pinghu Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, June 21.

### U.S. Ambassador Travels Through Yunnan to Chongqing; American People Sympathetic to China's Resistance; Ambassador Praises Yunnan-Burma Road Project

Kunming Air Dispatch: U.S. Ambassador Johnson, returning from the U.S. to his post, passed through Yunnan on his way to Chongqing and arrived in Yunnan on the 7th of this month. According to the ambassador, "The American people are extremely sympathetic to China's resistance and believe that victory will ultimately belong to China." He also mentioned that on his previous trip back to the U.S., he took the Yunnan-Burma Road. He said that the Yunnan-Burma Road project was vast, similar to the Panama Canal project in the U.S. The Chinese government was able to complete this great project in a short period, and it is said that the road construction did not use machinery but relied purely on manual labor, which shows the people's perseverance and hard-working nature, which is unmatched elsewhere, and is truly admirable. However, it is inevitable that collapses will occur during rainy weather. It is hoped that the spirit of road construction will be maintained to repair it at any time to keep it unobstructed, which will greatly benefit transportation. On the afternoon of the 8th, the ambassador went to the provincial government to meet with Chairman Long, and they had a pleasant conversation. At 4 p.m. on the 9th, 16 groups from the Provincial National Diplomacy Association welcomed the ambassador at Yunnan University, with more than 200 people attending. On the 11th, the ambassador set off by car from Guizhou to Chongqing.

As for Guangxi, I personally went to inspect all the important counties in the province and witnessed the enthusiasm of out-of-school adults entering school, their diligence in studying, and the determination and effective supervision of the authorities, as well as the resolute enforcement of laws and regulations forcing people to enter school, which is exciting. It is expected that illiteracy in the province will be completely eliminated as scheduled, which can be reported to the people of the country.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Exports Over the Past Year; Reason to Celebrate the Future of Chinese Silk; Such Achievements Amidst Hardship and Adversity Prove That Self-Reliance is Not Difficult

In the more than 20 months since the war, Shanghai's export situation, from June 27 to May 28, has shown considerable progress. On the one hand, this is due to the tense global silk production and sales relationship, which stimulated the rise in silk prices; on the other hand, the amazing efforts of the Chinese silk industry subjectively are also the most important factor. Looking at the almost complete destruction of silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang after the war, as well as the re-emergence of silk factories in Shanghai after the war shifted westward, and the almost year-round day and night operation of all newly opened silk factories in this term, the fewer production tools were able to obtain a large amount of labor results. On the one hand, this is one of the reasons why all silk factories have obtained more profits, but on the other hand, at the time of survival and extinction, Chinese silk can still meet the needs of foreign countries to a considerable extent, so that "Shanghai silk," which was on the verge of bankruptcy after the war, can still circulate in the international market. This is truly the greatest contribution of both labor and management in the Shanghai silk industry in these 12 months. The details of Shanghai's silk exports over the past year are specially investigated and listed in the table below, with the total export volume of the past three years attached for comparison:

Statistics of Shanghai's silk exports over the past year (unit: picul) Looking at the table above, in the first year of Shanghai's silk exports after the war, the exports to Europe fell by 10,565 piculs compared to the previous year, the exports to Asia fell by 4,960 piculs, and the exports to the United States fell by 17,688 piculs. In the first year of the war, Shanghai's total silk exports fell by 32,213 piculs compared to the previous year. If the silk price is 1,000 yuan per bundle, the silk exports affected by the war that year should be over 32 million yuan. However, in the last year (June 1, 27 to May 31, 28), the phenomenon of the revival of the Chinese silk industry in Shanghai is deeply gratifying. Its performance in exports has jumped out of the war by onefold in the first year, with 19,169 piculs transported to the United States, 12,713 piculs transported to Europe, and 5,714 piculs transported to Asia and Africa, totaling 37,596 piculs. Although this figure is far below the pre-war level, this point is enough to establish our confidence in self-reliance and regeneration, and enough to guarantee that Chinese silk will dominate the world market when the final victory comes.

### Finance: Pure Gold Down Slightly; Ornamental Gold Still at Original Price

Spot red market situation: Due to the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, business was suspended, and most of the money exchange shops were also closed. No transactions were heard outside the spot market.

The jewelry stores are still open as usual. The selling price of jewelry gold per tael is still 270 yuan for Datong Bank, 268 yuan for Xin Bank, and 262 yuan for purchases.

The Central Bank was open as usual yesterday. Upon receiving a London telegram on the 20th, the British pure gold fell slightly by a half penny, and the price per ounce fell to £7 8 shillings 5.5 pence, causing the bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold to fall to 1,211.9 yuan. The listed customs gold is still 2.396 yuan, and the Shanghai standard gold price is 40 cents lower, at 1,207.2 yuan.

### Large Bars Shrink Sharply; Indian Silver Falls Again

According to London Telegram on the 20th, silver market conditions: The Indian and speculators sold out, and there was a lack of maintenance. The market was weak. After closing, it was stable and hard. Indian and American merchants bought at a higher price of 0.0625 at the listed price, but the seller's supply was very weak. The recent large silver bars have shrunk sharply by half a penny, and the forward ones have fallen sharply by 4.375. Also, New York Telegram, American Silver is as solid as ever. Also, Bombay Telegram, Indian silver market conditions are still weak. Both current and futures have continued to fall by five annas.

Also, Reuters London, June 21: The price of silver fell sharply for a long time today. The spot price per ounce is fixed at 19 pence 125, while yesterday it was 19 pence 625. This definite price cut is not purely accidental. The reason is that most people are hesitant about the US Treasury Department's policy of buying foreign silver after the end of June, which caused panic. It is heard that the market is currently lacking buyers, and there are speculative sales and many liquidations, causing the market to be unduly and heavily affected. News and communications from all walks of life expect that the unstable situation will continue until the US Treasury Department makes a decision. Today's price changes may reflect many rumors about this matter.

### Statistics of Bank Checks and Notes Exchanged in May

### Yarn and Flower: About 8,000 Pieces of Cotton Yarn Will Be Released Soon

Since the tightening of foreign exchange in the yarn market, speculators in the market have been active, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of buying and selling chips. The market situation is unpredictable and difficult to grasp. After investigating the inside story of transactions in the market, some bulls have slightly emerged. However, the amount absorbed by the gold industry and the securities industry is in and out from time to time. Therefore, the waves are surging, and the majority of sentiment is still bullish. However, with the tightening of silver, the financial community has said that discounts on commodity mortgages will be reduced. If implemented, the buying trend may be slightly curbed. Recently, the factories have released a total of seven or eight thousand packages of coarse and fine yarn. The production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in other factories is also becoming increasingly busy.

As for the cotton situation, the situation of local cotton is not worth mentioning in a bad environment. However, foreign cotton has risen a lot due to the impact of exchange rate contraction. However, its corner has always been in a hovering state, without great expansion. Items with "　" in the table have no definite guarantee.

### Japanese Troops Landed in Swatow - Information from the Shipping Industry - Suiyang Wheel Detained Passing Swatow, Unclear Where Japanese Troops Landed - Two British Vessels Sail to Swatow as Usual Today

Yesterday morning, this city spread news of Japanese troops landing near Swatow, but according to the shipping industry, as of yesterday evening, there was no confirmed information. Although various evening newspapers have special dispatches from Hong Kong and Reuters reports confirming it, the name of the place where the Japanese troops landed is unknown. The following is a record of the information obtained by shipping merchants in this city yesterday:

Suiyang Did Not Dock Passing Swatow

The British vessel Suiyang left Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. on the 18th, carrying goods to Swatow and Hong Kong. It arrived in Swatow on the evening of the 20th (the day before yesterday). When it attempted to enter the port to unload goods at dawn yesterday morning, it was dissuaded by a certain party, so it stopped entering the port and sailed directly to Hong Kong. It also telegraphed the Shanghai office to report. Because the telegram was brief and the truth was unclear, the Shanghai office sent a telegram to inquire. In the morning, it received a reply from the vessel, roughly stating that Japanese troops had landed near Swatow, and it was prevented from entering, so it went directly to Hong Kong.

Japanese Warships Concentrated Outside Swatow

After learning of the Suiyang vessel's news yesterday morning, the British shipping company found that its New Yisheng vessel also left Shanghai at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th for Swatow and the coastal defense of Hong Kong. It was estimated to be in Swatow as well. Why was the situation in Swatow so severe that the vessel had no telegram to report? So, at 9:15 a.m. yesterday morning, it sent a telegram to the Swatow branch to inquire. At 11:40 a.m., it received a reply from the Swatow office, only stating that there were many Japanese warships outside the port and that the city was still peaceful. There was no mention of Japanese troops landing, nor was there any advice to stop loading and unloading goods.

Desheng and Zesheng Enter the Port as Usual

The company has two vessels, Desheng and Zesheng, sailing to South China today, also to Swatow and Hong Kong. Although there was news of Japanese troops landing in this city yesterday, the Swatow branch's reply was still peaceful. Therefore, passengers and goods were loaded as usual yesterday, but passengers were notified that goods would be loaded as usual. If an incident occurred in Swatow, the goods would be taken to Hong Kong. According to the office, as of 6:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, there was no news of changes in Swatow. Therefore, the two vessels will depart for Swatow at 2:30 p.m. today according to the scheduled sailing time. Moreover, both vessels have wireless equipment and can send telegrams at any time.

### Shanghai-Tianjin Freight Transportation Has Been Smooth

Dingsheng Telegraphed That It Arrived in Tianjin Yesterday Morning - Hengsheng Carries Goods North Today - The British and French Concessions in Tianjin Have Been Blockaded by the Japanese Army for Nine Days Now. British Vessels Going to Tianjin in This City Once Stopped Loading Goods. Later, Seeing the Risheng and Shuntian Vessels Arrive in Tianjin Without Being Searched, the Situation Was Slightly More Relaxed. Therefore, the Hunan and Guisheng Vessels Going to Tianjin the Day Before Yesterday Have Resumed Freight Transportation, as Reported in the Previous Newspaper. It Is Now Known That the Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng Vessel, Which Left Shanghai for Tianjin at 1:00 p.m. on the 15th, Arrived in Tanggu at 5:00 a.m. Yesterday (the 21st). The Vessel Telegraphed Yesterday Morning, Stating That Once the Tanggu Flour Is Unloaded, It Will Sail to the Tianjin Wharf. It Is Reported That Although the Vessel Did Not Load Goods When Going to Tianjin, It Carried 200 Tons of Foreign Goods from a Hong Kong Shipping Company to Tianjin, So It Must Go to Tianjin to Unload. After Unloading, It Will Come to Shanghai from Tianjin Tomorrow, Estimated to Arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. Today, the Company Has Another Hengsheng Vessel Continuing to Load Goods for Transportation to Tianjin. Therefore, Shipping in the Tianjin Concessions Has Been Smooth.

### Counselor of the German Embassy Transferred to Shanghai Consulate

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st - Fischer, Counselor of the German Embassy in China, has been in charge of embassy affairs since Ambassador Trautmann returned to Germany. He has recently been ordered to be transferred to the Consul General in Shanghai. Before Ambassador Tao returns to office, he will be replaced by Altenburg, the German Consul General in Guangzhou.

### Two Concessions Make Efforts in Safety Campaign

Eliminating Vendors and Beggars Along the Way to Avoid Obstruction and Accidents

The Safety Campaign Publicity Week initiated by the Public Concession's Public Works Department began on the 18th. Yesterday was the fourth day, and all work was proceeding as usual. However, the police departments of the two concessions believed that sidewalk vendors, street vendors selling vegetables, and beggars were disrupting traffic and hindering the safety campaign. Because these vendors block sidewalks or roads, vehicles and pedestrians often violate regulations. Therefore, yesterday, they dispatched personnel to various roads to correct licensed vendors. Those without licenses were all banned, and beggars were arrested to ensure smooth traffic. Since the implementation of the road traffic regulations in the two concessions, citizens have been able to comply with the instructions of the patrol officers, so the order is well maintained.

### Anti-Japanese Leaflets Found in the Bund and Yangshupu - Criticizing the Japanese Side for Disrupting China's Financial System - Accusing "Huaxing" of Exchanging Legal Tender with Waste Paper

Dabaoyun, on Sunday, someone distributed a large number of anti-Japanese leaflets called "To the Chinese People" in the Bund and the western district of Yangshupu, vehemently criticizing the Japanese side's attempt to disrupt China's financial system. The signatory was "Those Who Hope to Help You." After the leaflets were issued, a large team of Japanese military police

Immediately Blocked

All nearby passages, searching pedestrians and vehicles. One part of the leaflet stated that your blood enemies and quasi-traitors have now organized the so-called "Huaxing Bank," whose purpose is to destroy your monetary system and use the waste paper they issue to exchange for your legal tender.

Accepting Counterfeit Money

Is tantamount to shooting your own front-line warriors, is no different from piercing your heart with an arrow, is like digging your ancestral grave, and is even like allowing your wives and daughters to live as slaves under the oppression of the enemy. Uniform Collection of Sand and Gravel Import Duties.

37.5 Cents Per Ton Must Be Paid in One Go at the Wusong Estuary. Since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Association, after the Wusong Estuary branch of the customs was suspended, all sand and gravel transported to Shanghai was taxed by the customs after being transferred to the Suzhou River. Now that the Wusong Estuary branch has been restored, sand and gravel duties are collected as usual, at the rate of 37.5 cents per ton. The Shanghai Sand and Gravel Association has noted that the customs branch at the Wusong Estuary has resumed taxation. However, all sand and gravel, once transported to the Suzhou River, will still be taxed as before. The association believes that the matter concerns the burden on the industry and that it is necessary to request the customs to collect taxes uniformly. It jointly sent a letter to Mr. Luo Fude, the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, with the Fishing Boat Sand Transport Industry Association, requesting him to order the uniform collection of sand and gravel duties. Previously, the Jianghai Customs replied to the two associations, agreeing to follow the request. It is now known that the relevant duty has been stipulated by the Jianghai Customs authorities as follows: (1) Those who have already collected duties at the Wusong Estuary branch will not be taxed again after being transferred to the Suzhou River; (2) It is stipulated that the duty for each ton of sand and gravel is 37.5 cents, which must be paid in one go at the Wusong Estuary branch; (3) If the same incident occurs again in the future, it can be reported to the customs for exemption from taxation. The Jianghai Customs has notified the tax police of the Wusong Estuary and Suzhou River branches, along with the measures.

Ningbo Fellow Association Asks to Restore Shanghai-Ningbo Passengers

For the convenience of fellow villagers, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has sent telegrams to President Chiang, Governor Gu and Commanders Liu of Zhejiang Province, Chairman Huang, and Commander Guo of the Ningbo Defense Department, requesting permission to restore passenger transport between Shanghai and Ningbo. The telegrams have recently been sent.

### European Refugees Plan to Come to China to Open Up a New "Land of Happiness" - It is Heard that the National Government Will Allow This Plan to Be Implemented Under Certain Circumstances

Disclosed by German Banker Bogras

The Mainland Newspaper Yun, German banker and industrialist Bogras, is currently discussing with senior officials of the Chinese government to open up a new "land of happiness" in China. Based on a well-organized economic system, it will accommodate 100,000 European refugees. Thus, the problem of homeless Jewish refugees may have a sign of possible solution. This news was disclosed by Bogras himself yesterday (the 20th) when he hosted a press conference at the Cathay Hotel. According to reports, the Chinese government allowed him to prepare for immigration to China by the Yunnan Provincial Government under certain circumstances. They have the right to reside and work, and enjoy government protection and the same rights and responsibilities as Chinese citizens. According to the written statement issued by Bogras, the outline of his plan is as follows:

Immigrants Must Have Sufficient Funds

All those who come to China must bring sufficient funds to cover food and accommodation for about one year. Part of this fund will be used to purchase materials necessary for resettlement and to open shops. In the first year or two, a committee and a cooperative bank will be organized by the heads of various immigration agencies around the world to handle food, accommodation, and commercial matters in accordance with the proposed economic system, and to provide training in preparation for self-reliance in the future when opportunities arise. Many senior officials of the Chinese government have agreed to this proposal in their personal capacity, and soon

The Most Difficult Economic Problem

At the same time, letters have been sent to the leaders of various immigration agencies around the world, seeking their opinions on this matter. The main difficulty that may be encountered before the implementation of this plan is the economic problem. However, if effectively organized, most immigrants can become self-sufficient within one or two years. In view of the fact that immigrants who want to go to various countries in the world are either not allowed to enter or feel extremely difficult when entering the country, this decisive opportunity should not be underestimated. There are many opportunities to engage in revival in a vast country, and the opportunities will be abundant after the end of the war.

Political Motives Vigorously Avoided

There are at least 500,000 people in the world who are eager to move to any place, but all matters related to this plan must not have political or secret motives. The immigration problem must be handled on an economic basis in order to be resolved. Bogras then answered reporters' questions, saying that prospectors must be carefully selected, and the most suitable jobs for those who colonize China are transportation, machinery, and chemistry. This plan will be applied not only to Jewish refugees, but also to any homeless person in the current situation, not limited to any particular religion, but it is absolutely not political in nature.

Use Immigrants to Develop Resources

Southwestern China has always been known for its hidden resources. If Europeans are transplanted, the Chinese government and the immigrants themselves will benefit from it. Bogras, the host of this plan, has visited the Far East several times in the past five years and is very concerned about the Jewish refugee issue.

### The Dragon Boat Festival Was Spent Peacefully - Smooth Settlement of Accounts in Various Industries - Although the Foreign Exchange Rate Rose, the Money Supply Was Not Tight - The Credit System Was Gradually Restored

Loans Released Were Recovered on Schedule, with Very Few Bad Debts

Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and the silver and money industry and various industries and markets were closed. The finances were stable, and various industries passed the festival peacefully. Under abnormal development, various industries gradually resumed the credit system. The details are as follows:

Silver and Money Industry Closed, Various Industries Closed

The members of the Silver and Money Industry Association, as well as the Exchange, Acceptance, and other establishments of the Market Preparation Treasury, took a day off for the Summer Festival. Various industries and markets, such as soybeans, rice, securities, cotton yarn, miscellaneous grains, flour, cash, sugar, and cotton cloth, were closed for a day for the Dragon Boat Festival. Most factories, firms, and companies were also closed to handle the settlement of accounts for the Dragon Boat Festival. The people of Shanghai could not avoid the custom, and calamus, artemisia, and zongzi (glutinous rice dumplings) were abundant in the market, becoming essential items for households. As for foreign banks, foreign firms, and institutions such as the Public Works Department and the Public Administration Bureau, they also stopped working as usual.

The Market Was Stable, and Prices Soared

The Shanghai financial market remained as stable as ever. Except for the interbank lending rate rising to 25%, other interest rates remained largely unchanged. In Shanghai, which is abnormally developed, funds are abundant and difficult to use. At the same time, the increase in population has led to speculative activities such as hoarding, which has caused prices to soar. Various industries can make profits. Therefore, for this year's Dragon Boat Festival, the accounts released by various industries can be recovered, and some of the previous old accounts can also be recovered. However, since the exchange rate has tightened, the price increase of foreign goods is expected by everyone, and most domestic goods have also announced price increases at the same time, which is very disheartening. Speculators can make a profit of 4% by using foreign exchange, and they flock to it, which increases the demand for legal tender. The discount rate for remittances and notes has soared, reaching 70 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of 16 yuan compared to the previous few days. Merchants and the bourgeoisie have also purchased and hoarded goods in legal tender, attempting to manipulate the market and wait for a good price to sell. Therefore, the high prices of this Dragon Boat Festival are unprecedented in previous years.

Funds Are Needed, and Bad Debts Are Very Few

The population of Shanghai has surged, and the branch offices of various banks in the war zone have withdrawn to Shanghai and are operating as usual. Therefore, funds are concentrated, and deposits have increased. Because there is an excess of funds and narrow investment channels, speculative activities are flourishing. Recently, the prices have soared, and the purchase and hoarding of goods has become a way to make money. Therefore, deposits in various banks continue to decrease. Although various banks once increased the interest rate on mortgage loans to 8%, most of them have recently stopped accepting them, which shows that there is an excessive demand for funds and insufficient supply. Therefore, the phenomenon of excessive funds in recent years seems to have become a thing of the past. Banks and money shops have also recovered the released funds on schedule due to the abnormal development of various industries, with very few bad debts.

### A Japanese Plane Crashed and Was Completely Destroyed in the Suburbs of Yuhuan - Two Pilots, One Killed and One Captured - Japanese Warships Fired Dozens of Shots Afterwards

Coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have recently been attacked by Japanese aircraft from time to time. A few days ago, a Japanese reconnaissance plane in Dongtou (80 li away from Yuhuan County), which belongs to Yuhuan County, crashed due to damage to the aircraft's parts during the flight. When it landed, the fuselage was completely destroyed. One Japanese pilot was killed on the spot, and another Japanese pilot was captured by the Chinese defense forces and has been escorted to a certain place. After the Japanese plane crashed, a Japanese warship sailed to the sea off Yuhuan and fired dozens of shots at Dongtou, which landed in the wilderness. There was no loss to the local area.

### Maintaining People's Livelihood - Concessions Will Set New Rice Prices - Each Stone Will Be Increased to 21 Yuan First - Shanghai's Rice Stock is Sufficient, Citizens Need Not Worry

The price of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Market has soared, breaking the 22 yuan mark, which has a significant impact on the people's livelihood and social stability. Since representatives from various rice industry groups visited the concession authorities to suggest stabilizing rice prices and maintaining the people's livelihood, the authorities have taken measures, and there is sufficient stock. It is hoped that citizens need not worry. The details are as follows:

Concessions Consider Setting New Price Limits

After receiving suggestions from rice industry groups, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has taken measures after research and consideration. In addition to making every effort to maintain the people's livelihood within the concession and stabilize rice prices, the first step is to lower rice prices to a certain new price limit, which is said to be 21 yuan per stone. It is also believed that Shanghai's rice stock is still sufficient, and the source remains uninterrupted. The entire concession will not lack food, so it is hoped that citizens will remain calm and need not worry. It is considered unnecessary to order foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for relief.

The Management Committee Is Scheduled to Meet Today

The Management Committee of the Soybean and Rice Market has scheduled to invite 105 firms in the market at 3:00 p.m. today to persuade them to take the overall situation into account and not to speculate on rice in order to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai and suppress rice prices. The market was also closed for two days starting yesterday to handle the settlement of accounts for the Dragon Boat Festival, and trading will resume on the 23rd. It is hoped that the market will be able to open after the Dragon Boat Festival, so that rice prices can fall back to within 21 yuan, and hoarders will no longer engage in speculative transactions. At the same time, it is hoped that various firms will advise hoarders that it is easy to breed mold and insects during the yellow plum season, and it is not advisable to hoard any more.

Shanghai Has a Stock of 600,000 Bags of Rice

The food supply for the people of this city is extremely abundant. According to a survey by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, last week, the rice stocks in various rice warehouses still had 523,822 bags. However, this is only the total number of rice stocks in various rice warehouses. The number of rice sold by rice shops and rice purchased and hoarded by citizens is certainly not small. According to estimates from the rice industry, it amounts to as many as 500,000 to 600,000 bags. Therefore, there is absolutely no fear of food shortages in this city. However, the soaring rice prices recently are due to the Tianjin and Gulangyu incidents, which have prompted citizens to purchase and hoard, and the number of rice shops has doubled. Since foreign exchange has tightened, the foreign rice ordered from Saigon cannot be transported to Shanghai for relief. The above two are the speculative opportunities for unscrupulous merchants, and they are also the two major reasons for the high rice prices.

Every Effort Is Being Made to Dredge the Source of Domestic Rice

In addition to suggesting that the concession authorities find ways to suppress rice prices and dispatch personnel to assist in maintaining market order, etc., various rice industry groups have now agreed to the suggestions of the concession authorities. However, the leaders of various rice industry groups believe that in order to stabilize rice prices, it is first necessary to dredge the source in order to increase stocks, so that rice prices can fall back. It is said that the method will be proposed at the meeting of the Market Management Committee at 3:00 p.m. today. It is heard that the number of domestic rice being transported to Shanghai from various rice-producing areas has been increasing recently, but the various shipping merchants are no longer working as hard as they used to because there is no profit to be made. Yesterday, the various shipping merchants took a day off as usual due to the lunar Dragon Boat Festival, so there were no rice boats transported to Shanghai yesterday. They will continue to collect and transport rice starting today.

### Japanese Soldiers Enter Concessions Must Be Inspected

English Army performed its duties on the Daxilu.

At 10:30 a.m. on the day before yesterday, a Japanese military truck carrying more than a dozen fully armed Japanese soldiers entered the concession from Daxilu in western Shanghai. After crossing the boundary line guarded by the British army, it was suddenly chased back by the British army and ordered to stop. The Japanese army had no choice but to stop the vehicle, and the British army carried out strict inspections. Although the Japanese soldiers on the vehicle showed displeasure, there were no other actions, so fortunately, no accident occurred. It is heard that Japanese military vehicles entering the concession in the future must go through the British army's inspection procedures.

### Yunnan Post Office Burnt Down

The Shanghai Postal Administration received a telegram from the Yunnan Provincial Postal Administration yesterday, stating that the bureau suffered a fire last month due to careless handling of fire, and all packages, letters, vouchers, and orders were burnt down. Please notify the senders to quickly fill in a duplicate order for verification. It is now known that the Shanghai Postal Administration, after receiving the telegram, will issue a notice today due to the urgency of the matter, hoping that the senders will fill in the duplicate orders and send them to the bureau.

### Savings Movement Appeals: All Industries Should Curb Prices, Consider the Livelihoods of Ordinary People, and Stabilize Order; Simultaneously, Advise Citizens to Practice Thrift

The city's Savings Movement Committee, deeply concerned about the continuous rise in prices and the unabated inflation that has caused great panic among the livelihoods of ordinary people, yesterday issued a special article appealing to all industries to consider the overall situation and promptly curb prices. At the same time, they advised citizens to practice thrift and overcome the difficulties together. The following is a breakdown:

Appeal to All Industries to Curb Prices

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, due to the obstruction of transportation from the interior and the inconvenience of cargo transport, coupled with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the prices of all goods have risen sharply, nearly doubling compared to before the war. Ordinary salaried classes and working-class laborers find it difficult to make ends meet with their monthly income, and the feeling that "life in Shanghai is increasingly difficult" is now even stronger. Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, industries such as hardware, coal, Western medicine, woolens, and leather have successively announced price increases, with some rising by 30% to 50% or even more than 100%. Industries unrelated to foreign exchange have also taken the opportunity to raise prices. Some rice merchants even dared to manipulate the market and hoard goods, fueling inflation. Such actions, which only consider one's own interests and threaten the livelihoods of ordinary people, are extremely wrong. All sectors of the city are deeply concerned about this, believing that the continued soaring of prices will exacerbate social problems and have a detrimental impact on local order and public safety. Even the industries themselves will suffer. The Committee feels a sense of crisis and cannot remain silent. Therefore, it sincerely appeals to the leaders of all industries to take immediate measures to curb inflation. Profitable manufacturers should consider the overall situation and not raise prices rashly. Even if cost increases make it unavoidable, there should be a reasonable limit to prevent prices from becoming excessively high. In these extraordinary times, maintaining order in the rear is the duty that we should fulfill. It is hoped that all industries will share the difficulties and overcome them together. The residents of the isolated island will offer sincere prayers.

Advise Citizens to Practice Thrift

Due to the tightening of foreign exchange, various industries in Shanghai have again raised prices, causing distress in daily life. The price of rice is like pearls, and firewood is like cinnamon, making it difficult to sustain meals. The lives of residents in the isolated island are already severely threatened. However, there are still many people who indulge in extravagant lifestyles, spending fortunes on entertainment without hesitation, seemingly unaware that if the nation falls, where will they find refuge? Even those with wealth may find themselves impoverished. Moreover, the war is prolonged and without end. Future hardships are unpredictable. We should emulate the perseverance and determination of the past and start practicing thrift from now on. In this time of rising prices, save wherever possible. By reducing extravagance and contributing to the country and helping disaster victims, you will have peace of mind and a sense of security. Saving resources is cultivating national strength; saving the country is saving oneself. As for ordinary people, they should understand the difficulty of obtaining resources, discard vanity, and abandon extravagant habits to make their lives simpler. Only in this way can we overcome the difficulties. The future is long, and the hardships are intense. Fellow compatriots on the isolated island, let us encourage each other.

### American Warship Collides with Chinese Vessel: Officers Convene Court-Martial; Losses of Sailboat Carrying Fish Amount to 3,000 Gold Coins; The Ship at Fault Must Leave Shanghai After the Inquiry is Completed

The English-language 大　 Evening Post reports that a court-martial organized by American naval officers investigated the incident in which the American destroyer USS Barker collided with a Chinese sailboat at 1:00 PM on Sunday, the 20th. The committee resumed its inquiry on the USS Ward yesterday morning (June 21st). It was found that the USS Barker, along with three other destroyers, set sail from Shanghai to Qingdao on Sunday.

Near Wusong Donggou

The bow of the warship collided with a Chinese sailboat that was crossing the river, splitting the sailboat into two. The people on board were rescued by nearby sampans. The sailboat was crossing the river towards Shanghai when the incident occurred. The estimated loss of the sailboat and its cargo of fish is 3,000 yuan. It is unknown whether the bow of the warship was damaged. After the incident, the USS Barker turned around and

Returned to Shanghai

Now it is docked at the naval pontoon. It will leave Shanghai after the committee completes its investigation. The USS Barker belongs to the Third Destroyer Division of the United States Asiatic Fleet and was sailing to North China with the USS Alden, USS Whipple, and USS Edsall to join the fleet for summer exercises.

### Public Bus Issues Tokens

Industries Individually Seek Remedies

After the shortage panic of copper coins in the Shanghai market, caused by unscrupulous merchants hoarding them for profit, industries sought remedies by using stamps and revenue stamps as replacements. The Shanghai Tram Company and the French Concession Tram Company both issued fractional tokens. Now, the Chinese Public Bus Company of the International Settlement, in addition to reissuing the previously minted and withdrawn fractional coins, is now using the previously minted zinc passenger counters as two-fen coins. The coins are round, with a model of a public bus and the English words "China General Omnibus Co. Ltd." on the front, and the signature "GDS" on the back.

### Charcoal Market: Abundant Reserves

Sufficient to Supply the City for Half a Year; Supply Exceeds Demand, Prices Do Not Rise

The city's demand for charcoal fuel has traditionally been met by the Charcoal Guild sending members to Wenzhou, Zhejiang to purchase it. However, due to the interruption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou, the source decreased. Fortunately, the reserves were sufficient. However, due to hoarding by speculators, market prices fluctuated. Later, the Guild convened a meeting to unify the selling price, which allowed them to weather the crisis. According to news from the charcoal industry, since the Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping route reopened, a large amount of Wenzhou charcoal and Huangyan firewood has been shipped to Shanghai for adjustment. The current charcoal reserves in Shanghai are extremely abundant. In the market transactions, due to the ample supply of spot goods, supply exceeds demand, and major dealers are selling off their stock. Although the cost of shipping is relatively high, industry insiders, considering that fuel is a daily necessity for citizens, have decided to sell at the purchase price. It is estimated that the current charcoal reserves in Shanghai are around 80,000 to 90,000 dan, sufficient to supply the city for six months. The industry is still continuing to purchase, and large quantities may be shipped to Shanghai in the coming days. Therefore, amidst the rising prices of all goods, only the price of charcoal remains the same.

### Tushanwan New Police Station Strengthens Defense

Japanese and Puppet Military Police Attempted to Surround the Station the Day Before Yesterday Afternoon

The area near the Tushanwan Catholic Church in Xujiahui, which people at the time called the "Church Concession," has been temporarily established by the French Concession authorities as a new police station, which has now been formally established and has begun operations, with the aim of ensuring the safety and security of the local residents. It is understood that the Japanese and puppet authorities are extremely unhappy with the French authorities' decision. At 6:00 PM yesterday, a large number of Japanese and puppet military police, armed, rushed to the border area, attempting to surround the new police station. French, Chinese, and Annamite police officers, witnessing the seriousness of the situation, immediately reported to the police station. Subsequently, a large number of detectives were dispatched to assist in the defense. The police station also immediately reported to the General Police Station, and armored vehicles and armed detectives rushed to the scene, creating a tense situation. However, the forces soon withdrew, and the tense situation eased. However, the French Concession authorities attached great importance to the area. Yesterday, several trucks loaded with workers, bricks, and cement rushed to the vicinity of the new police station to build strong fortifications.

### Enthusiastic Individuals Actively Donate Funds for Refugee Children

Over 2,700 Yuan Received

The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association provides shelter for refugee children from newborns to 16 years old, as well as maids from 6 to 17 years old. There are currently a total of 900 refugee children and maids being cared for, requiring an annual expenditure of 60,000 yuan. The Association, feeling the difficulty and importance of its work and the enormity of its expenses, launched a campaign to raise funds for the education and care of refugee children in Shanghai from the 15th of this month. In recent days, donations from people from all walks of life have reached 2,777 yuan, and more are still being sent in. Among the donors, Mr. Song Wanfu from Qinglian Pavilion wrote, "As a tea house worker, my abilities are limited. Hearing that your association is working for the well-being of refugee children, I am willing to donate 2,400 bottles of '痧藥水' (a type of Chinese medicine) for the children's use. In addition, I previously initiated the construction of an auditorium in Pudong, and I am willing to allocate the 444.50 yuan from that fund to your association for the purpose of nurturing refugee children." Other donors include Chen Jiaqing and Chen Quan, who reside on Route Cardinal Mercier.

### Public Bus Company: New Route 17

Begins on June 24th, Between Rue Say Zoong and Jing'an Temple

### Restaurant and Catering Industry Decides to Implement: Summer Abolition of Cold Dishes

The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to promote the health of citizens, issued an order last summer requiring the restaurant and catering industry not to serve cold dishes at summer banquets to prevent the spread of unsanitary conditions and cholera. Due to the good results, it will continue to be implemented this year, stipulating that it will be enforced from July 1st to September 30th. The order was issued to the Industry Guild for compliance. The Guild held a meeting the other day and decided to notify all members to implement the order uniformly to avoid penalties. It also plans to send personnel to various restaurants and catering establishments to investigate the situation at that time.

### The Puppet Regime's Mediation on the Lanchang Labor Strike: No Results; The Conditions Are Harsh, Requesting the Employment of Puppet Police; The Factory Has Already Made It Clear That It Refuses

Regarding the labor strike at the Lanchang Factory in Pudong, Zhu Yuzhen, a "representative" of the puppet regime, led a group of activists into the factory for the fourth time yesterday to meet with the Westerners, pretending to mediate. It is reported that the "conditions" they put forward were very harsh. The first requirement was that the Russian guards of the factory be withdrawn and that "petition police" be hired from the puppet "police station." This was tantamount to attempting to place the entire British-owned Lanchang Factory under the protection of the puppet organization. This point involves international relations and has been explicitly rejected by the factory. Therefore, discussions on other points all ended without results.

### The Ministry of Finance Notifies All Provinces: Implementing Financial Policies

Internally Seeking Enrichment and Activity, Externally Resisting Aggression

In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, the Ministry of Finance has determined its financial policies to internally seek enrichment and activity, and externally resist the aggression of the Japanese. It has now notified all provinces to implement them uniformly: (1) Complete the financial network in the Southwest and Northwest, and urge local financial institutions in each province to establish branches to facilitate financial circulation; (2) Encourage savings, urge the opening of national construction savings accounts, absorb idle funds, and invest in productive industries; (3) Improve the methods of overseas remittances, urge the establishment of overseas remittance financial networks to facilitate overseas Chinese and enrich foreign exchange; (4) Allow local financial institutions in the war zone provinces to issue one-yuan notes and subsidiary currency notes to control the issuance of legal tender and prevent the Japanese from exchanging it; (5) Use local financial institutions and foreign merchants to purchase supplies in the war zone to prevent the materials in the war zone from being used by the Japanese, and to increase foreign exchange income and food for the military and civilians in the rear; (6) Strengthen the collection of gold and silver and work hard to develop gold mines to increase reserves; (7) Establish institutions to promote and connect economic and financial matters in the war zone, and plan for economic and financial matters in the area; (8) Use diplomacy to stop the circulation of Japanese and puppet banknotes and the seizure of foreign exchange. It is hoped that the provincial governments will implement these policies in earnest in order to achieve satisfactory results. Through efforts in all aspects, we must ensure that the Japanese schemes are not successful and do our best to promote and awaken the masses to fight together. Anyone who hinders the implementation of the government's financial policies should be actively prevented, saving materials and financial resources, and contribute their strength to the country for the sake of the war of resistance and national construction.

### Zhejiang Orders All Transportation and Sales Offices: Must Not Stop Receiving Goods

In order to Avoid the Accumulation of Local Products and Affect Financial Conditions; Even if There are Difficulties, Efforts Should be Made to Maintain Operations

The Eighth District Administrative Inspectorate of Zhejiang Province was ordered to instruct all transportation and sales offices to investigate the fact that since the Japanese aircraft have wreaked havoc, some transportation and sales offices have been using the excuse of poor economic conditions and transportation difficulties to stop receiving goods, resulting in the accumulation of local products and financial stagnation, which has had a profound impact on society. It is important to know that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, the rear is more important than the front, and production is more important than combat. All the transportation and sales offices bear the special responsibility of transporting and selling production. Even if the situation is difficult, efforts should be made to maintain operations. Why should they stop receiving goods arbitrarily due to temporary setbacks, which would harm the cause of resistance and construction? It has been ordered to the Wenzhou paper, egg, plank, and charcoal transportation and sales offices to comply. In the future, no matter what the situation, they shall not stop receiving goods without approval, and they shall list the business hours and the price of receiving goods for inspection and approval.

### Guo Shunzhe's Son Completes Marriage: Feast Funds Transferred to Help Refugees

Mr. Guo Shun, a well-known Cantonese merchant and general manager of Wing On Textile Factory, is usually diligent in doing good deeds and has a long-standing reputation for benevolence. On the 17th of this month, he completed the marriage for his decision son and specifically transferred the feast funds for relatives and friends to charitable causes to relieve refugees. It is reported that the Guangdong Fellow Compatriots Relief Committee, which is organized by fellow Cantonese in Shanghai, also dispatched 2,000 yuan in national currency to the feast, which Mr. Guo has sent to the committee for verification. Mr. Guo's actions are benefiting the refugees. The multitude of descendants and the continued prosperity of his family can be anticipated. Self-help and helping others are truly great events.

The Association convened the general directors of the industry, citizen, fellow hometown, dance hall, and opera fan groups to discuss fundraising methods.

### Bank of Communications Continues to Hold Employee Training Classes

The branch employees of the Bank of Communications in the interior were ordered to gather in Shanghai. The Shanghai branch was suddenly overcrowded. For the evacuated employees, it was impossible to assign positions, and it was inevitable to feel idle. Chairman Qian Xinzhi and General Manager Tang Shoumin of the head office, considering that all the employees were excellent young people and it was a pity to be idle, immediately ordered the Shanghai branch to start employee training classes for three months per semester. Those who were originally accountants were ordered to study Chinese, those who were originally clerks were ordered to study English, and other subjects such as banking and commercial regulations were also included to adjust academic knowledge and cultivate all-round talents. The head office also ordered Huang Bitong, the manager of the Hangzhou branch, and Manager Wu of the Qingdao branch to be responsible for preparations, with Wang Weisi, the secretary of the branch, in charge of academic affairs. Pan Yangyao was hired to teach Chinese, assisted by Huang Chengbo. Classes began on April 3rd and will end at the end of this month, marking the end of the first semester.

### Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Resigns: Committee Members Maintain the Status Quo

During extraordinary times, industrial and commercial groups should maintain the status quo, which has been clearly promulgated by the National Government. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, based on a report from the Guangdong Provincial Government to the Wuchuan County Government, stated that the business of Chen Defang, the chairman of the county chamber of commerce under its jurisdiction, had gone bankrupt, and the chamber's affairs had therefore fallen into disrepair. The County Government requested to hold a re-election to reorganize it. The Ministry replied that since Guangdong Province was maintaining the status quo for industrial and commercial groups, the chamber of commerce should not hold a re-election. As for Chairman Chen Defang's resignation due to bankruptcy, the existing committee members could jointly maintain the status quo.

### Xu Jufen, a Dancer at the Great Eastern Dance Hall, Unable to Endure Forced Prostitution, Sues Her Foster Father to Terminate the Adoption: The Plaintiff Did Not Appear in Court for Fear of Being Harmed

Sun Hongwu, a native of Suzhou residing at 19 Xiafei Lane on Avenue Joffre, is currently 45 years old. On August 3, 1931, he adopted Xu Jufen, a woman from Haiyan, through an introduction. She was only 12 years old at the time. The woman is currently working as a dancer at the Great Eastern Dance Hall. With a lawyer's representation, she has filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against her foster father, Sun Hongwu, to

Terminate the Adoption

And recover all of her clothing and accessories. Her reason is that the plaintiff, Xu Jufen, is now 21 years old and has reached the legal age of adulthood and autonomy. She is unable to endure the defendant's forced prostitution and was forced to leave home. She is suing for a judgment to terminate the adoption and recover her clothing and accessories. According to the report, Judge Wu Xiaoke opened the Civil Division 7 yesterday afternoon to hear the case. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated

The Reasons for the Lawsuit

And the object of the requested judgment. The defendant's representative, lawyer Zhu Weicheng, stated that he requested the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit and that the costs of the lawsuit should be borne by the plaintiff. He also stated that the case could originally have been settled amicably, but because the plaintiff's whereabouts were unknown, it was impossible to conduct a settlement. It would be best if the court could persuade the plaintiff's representative that settlement was the best option and that the plaintiff should be summoned to court so that father and daughter could meet and it would be easier to reach a settlement. The plaintiff's representative lawyer also stated that the two sides

Although They Had Previously Considered Settlement

It did not materialize because they were too far apart. Now the plaintiff has heard rumors that the defendant's side wants to have thugs throw acid on her, so she dares not come to court. If the court can protect the plaintiff from any accidents, then the plaintiff would be happy to come to court to be questioned. The court verified the statements and ordered a rescheduling of the hearing to 8:00 AM on July 8th, ordering both parties to settle amicably outside of court.

### Russian Guard's Transportation of Opium Case: Both Culprits Vehemently Deny

Luo Xinggaoyiwang (transliteration), the Russian head of the guards at the Swire Company's wharf, was arrested at 7:00 AM on the 10th of this month when he was found transporting a suitcase of opium weighing 36 pounds by rickshaw at the intersection of Rue Foch and Rue de la Cathédrale.

He did not know that it contained opium. The court verified the confessions and announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling the sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Huang Bao Che Merchant Yin Zhiling Sues for Land Lease, Files Suit Against Ye Huating for Fulfillment of Lease, Ye Files Counterclaim and Seeks Termination of Lease

Yin Zhiling, who operates Huang Bao Che (rickshaws), was previously sued criminally by rickshaw pullers in the First Special District Court for forging loan receipts. After a lengthy period, the case was concluded. Last winter, Yin, under the name of Anbu Enterprise Company's Yin Chulan, leased one mu and two fen of land from local resident Ye Huating, located at Yichang Road and Seymour Road in western Shanghai. An advance payment of 500 yuan was made. Later, because Yin

Did Not Follow Initial Agreement

the landlord prevented him from using the land, leading to a dispute between the two parties. After the First Special District Court acquitted Ye Huating, Yin filed another lawsuit in the civil court against Ye, seeking fulfillment of the lease. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo Runhua presided over the hearing. Ye also hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to file a counterclaim against Yin, stating that Yin, through Lu Liugen and Wang Chuanmao as intermediaries in November of last year,

Negotiated a Lease with Ye

for the land. Ye initially refused, citing difficulties with the filling of the creek. Subsequently, Yin and his wife arrived at Ye's house by car, claiming they had leased land in the surrounding area and that the creek could be filled. They presented a document for Ye to sign and paid a deposit of 500 yuan, with the agreement that a formal lease would be signed within a month. If the surrounding land could not be leased, the lease with Ye would be terminated. Yin did not lease the neighboring land for a long time, so Ye sent a letter to Yin in March of this year

Declaring Abandonment

of the previously signed document, with the deposit serving as compensation for land rent losses. Unexpectedly, Yin then surrounded the land with a fence, and when Ye tried to stop him, Yin accused Ye of damaging property. After a court investigation acquitted Ye, Yin not only filed another civil lawsuit but also forcibly hired workers to build houses. Ye intervened, and construction was recently halted. Therefore, Ye is filing a counterclaim, arguing that Yin deceived him due to his illiteracy and acted tyrannically. He points out that since Yin did not sign a formal lease, he cannot claim

Rights to the Land

and requests that the deposit receipt be revoked, the deposit not be returned, and the lease relationship be terminated. Lawyer Pan also requested in court that the original intermediaries, Lu Liugen and Wang Chuanmao, be summoned to court to testify about the negotiations. After questioning both parties, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing.

### Large Wine Jars Piled in Alleyway, Smashed by Health Department

Disregarding Public Health

Inside Meilan Alley, at the intersection of Avenue Balle and Avenue Lafayette in the French Concession, many large empty wine jars were piled up. The neighboring Public Health Department of the Municipal Council found that the wine jars were moldy and infested with insects, posing a health hazard. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the empty wine jars belonged to a Mr. Cao at No. 30 of the alley. Cao originally had a Xindefeng Wine Shop in Hongkou and relocated it to No. 110 Annakin Road after the war. The Health Department sent personnel to notify Mr. Cao to remove them, but Cao ignored the request. Therefore, the Health Department specifically sent workers at around 3 PM on the afternoon of the 20th to smash the empty jars one by one with hammers, totaling eighteen jars. The noise startled the neighborhood, who regarded it as a spectacle.

### Apprentice Rapes Girl

Sun Baoshan, a Qingjiang native apprenticing at a wooden crate workshop at No. 14 Kaifeng Road, aged nineteen, lured his eight-year-old neighbor, Ji Lindi, to the loft where he slept in the workshop at 4:10 PM on the 15th and raped her. The girl cried out in pain, and her mother, Ji Dengshi, hearing the screams, immediately apprehended the apprentice Sun and turned him over to the Huishi police station. He was handed over to the First Special District Court yesterday. Due to the nature of the case concerning morality, the hearing was closed to the public. The result was detention and a scheduled pronouncement of the verdict.

### YWCA Holds Summer Health Campaign

The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the Huxi Service Center, dedicated to serving poor women and children in the vicinity. It has a clinic that provides free medication and medical care, with renowned Shanghai doctors Shen Zhenghua, Ni Fengsheng, and Guo Xingsun generously volunteering their time each week to provide medical services at the center.

### Pudong Gonghexiang Warehouse, Phosphorus Explosion, Part of Cotton Burned

At the wharf of the British Gonghexiang Warehouse at Qichangzhan Ferry in Pudong, there are two warehouses, east and west. At around 5 PM on the 17th, a fire broke out in warehouse B in the east warehouse, burning more than 600 bales of foreign cotton, with a loss of 150,000 gold. While the source of the fire was still under investigation, an unexpected fire broke out four days later. At 11:20 AM yesterday morning, thick smoke and flames erupted from a pile of foreign cotton bales in warehouse C, adjacent to warehouse B. At that time, there were still ten minutes before the workers' lunch break, and the warehouse door was fortunately not closed, so it was discovered early. The Chinese fire brigade used fire extinguishers and water to put out the fire, completely extinguishing it in half an hour. It is estimated that one bale was destroyed and more than ten bales were charred, with each bale valued at 250 yuan, so the loss was relatively small. It is said that the fire was caused by a phosphorus explosion. It is unknown how this phosphorus material came to be in the warehouse, so the truth is difficult to determine.

### Symbols of the Dragon Boat Festival

— EL

The cherry rice wine has just been eaten, and the Dragon Boat Festival is here again. Tearing off a calendar page every day is really just a lift of the hand.

From cotton to interlining to single layer, clothes are getting thinner and thinner, and the body feels lighter; but of the three festivals in a year, the Dragon Boat Festival is the first to settle accounts. Although everyone can follow the method of "looking at the Dragon Boat Festival, calculating at the Mid-Autumn Festival, and returning half on New Year's Eve", seeing loquats and zongzi will still bring some feelings in the spirit; thus, the body will invisibly become heavier.

"How to spend the festival"? ... The festival is coming, but where is the money?" ... Such things can express the "law of life response" of ordinary people to the festival.

Using eating symbols to represent this dragon boat festival, then the triangle can very well symbolize the plane of zongzi. Although the current zongzi, whether Su style, Cantonese style, or even Western style - the lotus seed paste zongzi of a famous restaurant is translated into English as "sweet stuffed pudding" - are "varied", using a triangle to represent it does not have a profound meaning, and everyone can understand it at a glance.

Here, I came up with three symbols, representing the three great festivals of the year: zongzi, moon cakes, and New Year's cake. Aren't they ready-made triangles, circles, and squares?

Simplicity and honesty are the best disciplines of life. These three symbols can be said to be extremely simple, and their symbols are also the most honest. For example, if you teach these symbols to children, you can guarantee that they will definitely understand them. Unless the future zongzi all become thin slices, the moon cakes are replaced with squares, and the New Year's cake is made into pills, then these simplest deformed lines will lose their meaning.

In the classroom for geometry, these three symbols are also the basic representatives, and all kinds of changes are produced from this. From very simple, it can be transformed into very complex.

Life is originally like taking an arithmetic class. The older you get, the heavier the burden, and the more complicated the arithmetic problems become. There are probably very few people in the world who can escape this arithmetic class. Most people flip back and forth during the year, sometimes triangular, sometimes round, sometimes square, always jumping out of the symbols of this simple mystery of life.

That said, spending the festival is ultimately a meaningful thing. If the 365 days of the year pass without a festival, wouldn't life be too monotonous and without rhythm?

A triangle, small like an arrow, large like a mountain, the former contains the intention of forward, sharp, and piercing; the latter implies the spirit of calm, majestic, and extraordinary; in short, small is good, and big is even better, the Dragon Boat Festival this symbol is vividly full of optimistic emotions, and the meaning of progress.

We hope that in this year, starting with a triangle that is full of vigor and symbolizes construction, we will move forward with a sharp arrowhead, overcoming all difficulties; then pass through the chaotic circle to reach that perfect square ending.

### How to Obtain Fresh Air

— Lu Wenli

In the city, factories are lined up and the population is dense, so the air cannot be as fresh as in the countryside outside the city. So, of course, it is best to live outdoors.

But most of the things in the world have to be done indoors. What's more, on this crowded island, it is not easy to find a place to live indoors, let alone seek land to seek an ideal outdoor life? Therefore, the current problem of indoor air circulation must be paid serious attention to.

The air that people exhale is always lighter and warmer than the air they inhale. In winter, we can all see the warm air exhaled from our mouths rising slowly, which is sufficient proof. Therefore, windows should be set high in the room so that the exhaled air can flow freely from the high place. Conversely, if we need fresh air to flow into the room, then windows must be set low in the room. This does not mean that strong ventilation is hygienic, but that there must be proper fresh air in the living room to protect our health.

Some people think that the air at night is harmful to the human body, but this is not the case. The air at night is no different from the air during the day and is not harmful. So, opening the windows when you sleep, or sleeping outdoors in suitable weather, not only does not hinder your health, but also allows you to get smooth fresh air, which is good for your body.

### Safety First

— Yang Lizhai

"The road is like a tiger's mouth, you can't walk in the middle." If you are not careful when walking, you will be injured by a toothless tiger—a car, or even lose your life under the wheels. Especially in the most prosperous Shanghai, the streets are "crowded with vehicles", and you should be extra careful to obey the order and pay attention to your own safety when walking.

On the road, if there is a "pedestrian road" (the water gate walk beside the road), you must walk on the pedestrian road, don't walk in the middle of the road. And to "walk on the left," do not rush forward, this can be orderly and reduce the risk of collision. If there is no pedestrian road, you must walk facing the direction of the traffic - that is, on the right side of the road, you can see the vehicles coming from the opposite side.

The best way to cross the road is in a place with traffic lights (red and green lights at intersections to direct traffic); the red light tells you to stop, and you can pass straight through along the pedestrian line (yellow lines painted on the road) only when the green light is on. Some intersections do not have traffic lights, so you have to watch the gestures of the directing patrol police, or look to the left first, then to the right, to see if there are any vehicles coming. If there are vehicles about to drive, you must not take the risk. If a car is approaching you, you must stop immediately, not rush to run away.

Clever children! Concentrate your mind on walking, safety first!

### Beware of the Tiger's Mouth

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Onions have been extremely cheap lately; one copper coin can buy sixteen or seventeen, so it’s good to eat more of them. This item is very rich in vitamins and can stimulate the appetite and strengthen the lungs. Those with weak lungs should eat them daily, as it can be very beneficial to the body and may help avoid entering the stage of lung disease. Therefore, it is good to eat things like onions and garlic often, and don't be afraid to eat them because of the bad breath they leave behind. The most common way to cook onions is stir-fried with shredded beef, which is indeed very delicious to eat. While frying, a peculiar aroma fills the air, stimulating the appetite. In addition, onion and sweet potato stew with beef soup, whether braised in white or red sauce, is very delicious. If you don't eat beef, you can substitute it with pork, and try stir-fried shredded pork with onions, which is not inferior to shredded beef.

### From the Inventions of Unknown Scientist Mr. Shen Xieyu, Discussing Soybean Extract and Raw Material Hydrochloric Acid

— Huang Chengbo

Mr. Shen Xieyu, an unknown scientist in western Shanghai, devoted his entire life to chemistry, spending a huge amount of money. Although he exhausted his inherited family property, the shortsighted people in his hometown regarded him as foolish and ridiculed him, but Mr. Shen persevered. After thirty years of experience, he finally succeeded in his experiments, creating various fruit extracts, such as banana extract, lemon extract, orange extract, apple extract, etc. I personally tasted the samples, and they were fragrant. Other products included soap, hectograph paper, and many other items.

Mr. Shen considered soy sauce a daily necessity. Although there were many soy sauce shops in our country, they all stuck to old methods and had not made any improvements. Moreover, the production of soy sauce relied on sun exposure and required it to mold, which was not hygienic. Therefore, he focused on improving it, determined to research and develop it, and after many years, he finally invented Soybean Extract.

Soybean Extract is the chemical name for soy sauce essence. The manufacturing method is simple, the cost is low, and the taste is fresh and long-lasting, unlike ordinary soy sauce that is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste. Moreover, it is refined through scientific methods, using soybean cakes made from soybean dregs and aged alkali as raw materials, so it is non-toxic and extremely hygienic, truly a good friend of the kitchen.

After the invention of Soybean Extract, Mr. Shen submitted samples to the Central Health Administration for testing and applied for registration with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. After approval, he cooperated with Mr. Zhang Jingfu, a Shanghai native cloth merchant, to raise one hundred shares at one hundred yuan per share, totaling ten thousand yuan, to establish Huaming Industrial Society, specializing in the manufacture of Soybean Extract for the market.

The twentieth century is an era of chemical industry, and the chemical industry cannot be separated from the "three acids": "hydrochloric acid," "nitric acid," and "sulfuric acid." Therefore, it can be simply called the era of the three-acid industry. The manufacture of Soybean Extract, of course, cannot escape one of the three acids, "hydrochloric acid." It is made from amaranth cakes, aged alkali, and hydrochloric acid, and then refined. Hydrochloric acid is also an essential element for the military industry. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the suburbs have been controlled, and even overseas navigation by Europeans and Americans has been subjected to various difficulties. The import and export of ordinary goods are also under complete control, let alone hydrochloric acid related to the military industry, which naturally attracts more attention. Therefore, the purchase of hydrochloric acid is quite difficult. Mr. Shen used his natural chemical mind and decided to seek the manufacture of hydrochloric acid himself. As the ancients said, "Where there is a will, there is a way." After many years of research, he actually reached the stage of self-manufacturing hydrochloric acid. Currently, the hydrochloric acid used by all parties is foreign goods, which not only leads to the outflow of rights and interests but also is expensive and increases costs, which in turn increases the price of goods, which has a great impact on society. In recent years, there are indeed many chemical experts in our country, but it is rare for one person to invent multiple items at the same time (the items invented by Mr. Shen have been listed above, but there are still more). Moreover, Mr. Shen does not seek social interaction, so he has not yet become famous. Making friends should be done before one encounters success, so that they can share hardships and joys together. Once one becomes famous, their value will inevitably increase tenfold, and it will be difficult to ask for advice.

### Classmates

— Geng Zhi

The combination of people has "same surname" due to blood relations, and "same hometown" due to geographical relations, both of which are beneficial, needless to say; in addition, there is "classmate" due to origin, which seems to have its own benefits, and I cannot but spend some effort to commend it.

A few years ago, we heard that "a certain department" (classmates of a certain university) controlled the education of a certain province, so the educational circles of a certain province became "a certain university alumni association." On a slightly smaller scale, the faculty and staff of a certain school were all classmates of a certain university, so the school became "a certain university alumni association." Similarly, we also heard that the judicial officials of a certain province were all classmates of a certain law and political school, so the judicial circles of a certain province became "the alumni association of a certain law school;" or they were all classmates who studied in a certain country, so they became "the alumni association of a certain country." … Once a classmate, the reputation is tenfold, and the job is guaranteed, so you can eat without end. This is the so-called benefit of being a classmate.

Since it is an "alumni association," "non-classmates" are of course only squeezed out and cannot get a foothold. These "non-classmates" are of course resentful and angry. But I think for them, there is no need. Who doesn't have classmates? Why not create a few "alumni associations" to play with, instead of relying on others or trying to share their benefits? As long as you are tight-knit and powerful, it has always been allowed to create a homogeneous group and exclude dissidents, so why be polite? By creating your own alumni association, you can enjoy the benefits.

Originally, all classmates must be very loyal and do their best to help each other. For example, Sun Bin and Pang Juan of ancient times, I also think that they lived up to the friendship of classmates: because Sun Bin didn't have Pang Juan, where would he have his kneecap "binned" (removed), leaving a legacy for centuries and becoming a great man, and Pang Juan didn't have Sun Bin, where would he be shot to death in the Maling Road, leaving a stench for thousands of years and also becoming a great man—a great man should either leave a legacy for centuries or a stench for thousands of years! According to this analogy, their descendants Su Qin and Zhang Yi, although they seemed to have different views and their relationship was not very good, one advocated vertical alliance and the other advocated horizontal alliance, complementing each other and achieving the same goal by different means, and both obtained the position of minister. These four people formed a small "Guigu University Alumni Association" among the six countries, which can truly be compared with the modern "certain university alumni association."

For example, Guan Ning and Hua Xin, although they ended up "severing their mats," I think they are still worthy of being classmates. Because Hua Xin's achievements and even participation in the "palace coup" were ultimately inspired by Guan Ning, and Guan Ning's noble deeds of not serving kings and princes were also nurtured by Hua Xin. This is also a case of opposite and complementary, each with its own merits.

Taking current affairs as an example, we often hear that a classmate of a certain school does not engage in proper business but specializes in borrowing money from other classmates, and the alumni association issues a special notice, telling everyone not to be deceived; a certain candidate from a certain school committed a dishonorable criminal case and was detained in prison, and the alumni association hurriedly published a statement in the newspaper, denying that they had this classmate… In such cases, I still think that the alumni association is very loyal and willing to help each other, because in this way, it is enough to make the vulgar honest and the cowardly ambitious. They are publicly inheriting the consistent style of the "Guigu University Alumni Association." As for adding a job to a classmate who is beneficial to oneself, that is of course an expected article and not worth mentioning.

The virtuous policies of alumni associations in this regard are truly beautiful and countless, and it is necessary for me to make a resolution to remain silent in addition to praise. But there are things that are as beautiful as alumni associations, or perhaps even more beautiful, that I cannot but write about in connection. I always feel that my vision is not broad enough.

This is the so-called "same mountain gate," or simply "same mountain" or "same origin." It is a well-known beauty that "same mountains" can help each other bargain and fight, and if you want to accomplish great things, if you are the "big brother," you must have many "virtuous brothers" from the "same mountain" to help you. People like Zhao Kuangyin and Zhu Yuanzhang were able to rise to the throne because of this. Nowadays, this trend is gradually flowing into the scholar-official class, with a tendency to replace "alumni associations." Perhaps alumni associations will be eliminated!

However, before "alumni associations" are eliminated, I always envy "many young classmates who are not lowly, riding fat horses in light fur coats." I can't wait to insert myself into every such "alumni association"!

### The Procession of Fire

— Shan Di

The smooth, green stone road, tonight it should have the most active posture again. On the narrow sidewalks, people are densely packed, arranged in rows coming and going. At a glance, they jostle like millions of angry waves rising on the sea. The sidewalk is so crowded that people are spilled into the middle of the road one by one.

Especially at the corners of the busiest roads and on the steps of medieval watchtowers, people are as dense as the stars in the sky; they are not moving, stretching their necks and standing still.

Restaurants are also filled with people of all walks of life, and the upper floors are even more crowded with not a single space left; the row of low windows facing the road bears the burden of a large number of people leaning on them, looking out, looking at this unprecedented, lively, and grand scene in this ancient mountain city.

A majestic sound of drums and horns, a chaotic sound of cheers, finally broke through the dark sky and was broadcast closer; people moved again in a commotion, as if fearing that their good positions would turn bad, and their bad positions would not turn good.

The great procession of fire, led by the symphony of military music, moved solemnly, enthusiastically, and solemnly. Like a huge fire dragon shimmering with ten thousand feet of light, winding, long, and slowly lying in motion.

The intense flames painted a layer of undulating bright red on the surfaces of crowds, houses, groves, memorial arches…

At the head, a huge portrait of the leader, revealing a triumphant smile, carried by several bright gas lamps, made the people standing and watching could not help but stand in awe. The giant image is telling us that he 'has already seen the flame of victory; he encourages us to follow his instructions and embark on the road to bright success.

Arranged next to the giant image are two large rectangular lanterns. The white light emitted from inside makes the words written on them: "Kunming May Fourth Movement Torch Parade" appear even more beautiful.

Marching in the bright red torchlight are: university students, boy scouts, primary school students, soldiers, representatives of vocational groups. … They straightened their chests, aligned their steps, shouted earth-shatteringly to stir up the emotions of the masses, and sang movingly for the victory of the motherland, sweeping away pessimism, negativity, defeat… without leaving a trace.

Suddenly a team of yellow-black skinned, strange-faced "Overseas Chinese Mechanics Returning to Serve the Country" came; tall figures, uniform military uniforms. They raised torches, each burning brightly.

They couldn't sing much, but they would use their dialects to transform their hatred, anger…? … which had been tightly suppressed for a long time from the depths of their hearts into louder and clearer warnings. At the beginning of each short sentence, they couldn't help but forcefully raise the flag, raising the light waves of the neat line of flames above their heads.

There is no longer any concern, and they do as they wish to do. The moving shouts and the explosive actions made the onlookers excited, astonished, delighted, and elated. They couldn't wait to join their group and follow them to fight, serve, and live forever. …

Finally, a group of conscription team members of Tongji University diligently solicited donations from the crowd on the sidewalk along both sides of the road, not afraid of the trouble. And this group, who had just received fresh and intense stimulation, even the old women and coolies, generously took out their only few banknotes from their bodies and handed them over to the conscription team. Along with that, many more weights were added to this vast and brilliant national flag, which was suspended in the air and covered with colorful banknotes.

Several team members, very excited, very happy, let out silly laughs. …

Returning to the square, the movements were all silent, allowing countless torches to gather together, burning fiercely. The flames licked the boundless night sky. People cheerfully shouted the final slogans. …

The piles of fire were still enthusiastically, and without stopping, pouring out dazzling red light. …

She smiles,

My melancholy then transforms into,

A white dove,

Flying to the distant heart of the sky,

And disappearing.

Facing the silver candlestick,

The military uniform lightly glistens;

Her silver pupils,

Control my emotions.

You must set off?

Yes!

To the front?

Yes!

Tomorrow?

Yes!

Then do you miss your home?

I say "No!" (Who doesn't?)

Then you don't miss me either?

I say "No!" (Who doesn't?)

(The sky outside the tent is pitch black,

She shakes her complaining gaze.

However, the motherland is calling me,

So I forget my home and her!)

Under the silver candlelight,

Looking at my glistening military uniform,

My heart gently shouts,

"To the front—to the front,

Tomorrow—tomorrow morning!"

So her smile,

(And enchanting posture,)

Then like a flying white dove

Disappears to

The distant heart of the sky.

### Impressionistic Travels (Continued)

— Li Jinming

We didn't understand the cleverness of this thing, we just stared at it for a while.

Just as the lights were lit, I picked up the titled booklet and flipped through it. It was full of poems and commemorative texts. The handwriting of poets and writers, both named and anonymous, was dripping with ink. Writing a few words on it might feel meaningful, I thought, so I picked up a pen and wrote a few lines:

Layer upon layer of mountains, dense clouds lingering,

Only see monks, not Taoists;

Monks are rich, the people are poor,

Let's take some wine and get tipsy.

Da Peng and Xiao Peng looked at me writing like this, feeling a little uneasy. Because inappropriate satire can lead to unhappiness between host and guest. But the fierce-looking monk was someone with a special character. After reading it, he was unhappy at first, then he said: "Open-minded, open-minded! It's always good to praise me for being rich, and there will definitely be wine to drink. Fa Jing! Go prepare quickly, never mind the people, we'll be content if we don't humiliate them! But this doesn't rhyme!"

"Never mind, I'm not a poet," I put down my pen.

He asked Da Peng to write, and Da Peng wrote:

Seeing clouds is like seeing Buddha.

He then asked Xiao Peng, who was even more concise:

Appreciating the wind.

"Good, appreciating the wind!" the fierce-looking monk shouted, "It seems ordinary, but once you get to Shangfeng Temple, you'll know the immortality of these two words."

At ten o'clock in the evening, the moon crept in through the window. Da Peng and Xiao Peng were both snoring, only seeing the tired muscles on their faces twitching loosely. But I was thinking wildly, thinking about how such a good environment was inhabited by a group of stupid, lazy goods who lived by stealing in the name of the Buddha.

I thought, "If these people were still a group of writers, I don't know what kind of works they would write in the future. Maybe they would leave the true meaning of life, maybe they would escape the times, maybe they would make art so light and meaningless. But if we were this group of people, we would use our past experiences and imaginary landscapes. We might become Virgil, Boccaccio, Goethe, Flaubert…, we have to use will to do literature. Tao Yuanming, Li Bai, Lu You… these are all superior poets, but they are not what we should imitate. All Chinese national writers should not be imitated. They all have the defeated idea of escape. This so-called escape is not being able to 'ascend to officialdom,' and the view of failure is also because they cannot get '俸祿 (salary)'. These do not become the character of a writer; we should curse this mentality."

### Talking More

— Editor

According to Mr. Zhu Wen, one of the translators of "Patriot," there are as many as seven translators of this book in Shanghai alone. Whether this book should be so highly praised is another question, which has already been discussed yesterday. But I think, if someone is willing to compare these seven translations from the perspective of translation and write an article for everyone to see, it would also be a beneficial thing. I hope someone will do this work.

Entertainment Circle

### The Vicissitudes of Open-Air Cinemas

— Dehui

Xiyuan and Xinyuan in the city were the earliest. There were six or seven open-air cinemas before the war. I wonder if they can reappear this summer.

In the summer season, many seasonal places of entertainment will appear in Shanghai, and open-air cinemas are one of them. The general audience feels that sitting in an air-conditioned cinema in extremely high temperatures is not as comfortable as sitting in an open-air cinema on a grassy field with cool breezes under a sky full of stars. To adapt to this objective requirement, many open-air cinemas have been set up.

The first open-air cinemas in Shanghai were the movie screenings in the Xiyuan and Xinyuan gardens in the city area during the second year of Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty. However, due to the prevailing atmosphere at the time. As a result, it was banned by the Autonomous Public Institute. After more than ten years, in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, open-air cinemas rose again, namely the Xiaoxia Cinema on Bazhi Road and the St. George Open-Air Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road. In terms of equipment, the latter was more complete than the former. The venue was in a garden with green grass, and the rows of seats were also equipped with beer and soda, allowing people to drink as they wished. The films screened were also of a higher selection, so many people who wanted to have fun flocked to it.

In the summer of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the Dahua Hotel (now demolished) on Jing'an Temple Road opened the Dahua Open-Air Cinema. Because of its central location, convenient transportation, complete equipment, and the selection of first-class films, it was often full of guests at night, holding the top spot of open-air cinemas. This continued until Dahua was sold.

Later risers included the Racecourse Cinema and the Verdun Garden Cinema on Maierxi'ai Road, and cinemas were also opened on Jiaozhou Road and Kangnaot Road. For cinemas with flat roofs, such as the New World Fuxing Grand Theater (now the Xiaoyao Ballroom) and the Baixing Grand Theater on Fusheng Road, open-air movies were also screened for a period of time. In addition, open-air movie screenings on the roofs of amusement parks were even more common. But because they were ancillary, they did not attract as much attention as independent ones. The past history of open-air cinemas also has many vicissitudes to tell. The Dahua Hotel was demolished, Fuxing became the Xiaoyao Ballroom, St. George no longer exists, and Baixing has not been engaged in this business for many years. In recent years, the larger open-air cinemas that have been opened are only two: the Racecourse and one in a garden on Maierxi'ai Road. Open-air cinemas have also been opened on the roof of the Dahua Ballroom on Aiduya Road.

Shanghai has not had open-air cinemas for two summers since the war. I wonder if open-air cinemas can reappear this summer?

### Re-mentioning Old Affairs of Yu Shuyan

— Liu Zhengku

The famous actor Yu Shuyan had a family background and secretly studied with Lao Tan. Although he did not enter the room, he had indeed entered the hall. He has dominated the Juju Club for nearly 20 years and holds the bull's ear of the Xusheng. Both insiders and outsiders unanimously recognize him as one of the successors after Xinpei. In the society of the former capital, everyone called him "Xiao Yu." Xiao Yu's 之間 (between) reached the state of perfection, but his lonely nature, arrogance, and alienation from the group were the most unsatisfactory, which was the regret of his life. He usually did not like to talk much and acted calmly, which was actually "arrogance." It is inevitable for those who rely on talent to be arrogant, so why should I blame Xiao Yu alone? Looking back more than ten years ago, when Yun Hongqing presided over the Dangui, Xiao Yu came to Shanghai, touting the orthodox Tan School. Unexpectedly, the music was too high and few people responded, and the Shanghai people did not pay attention to it. He was greatly disappointed by the demonstration of power. As a result, Dangui was busy for nothing, without loss or surplus. When the performance period expired, Hongqing told him to help for a week, if not, then three days, if not, then two days or even one day. In the meantime, more than a dozen celebrities, including Guan Jiongzhi, interceded on his behalf, but Xiao Yu refused firmly. Yun was very angry, and his disciples were even more indignant, saying: Friendship should be reciprocated, who is Xiao Yu, who is not willing to give face, to such an extent; let's wait until the day he boards the wheel, and see how we give him a special farewell. The implied meaning was to do something unfavorable to Xiao Yu and insult him. Fortunately, Brother Ji Yunqing got the news and immediately rushed to Yipinxiang to meet Xiao Yu (Mr. and Mrs. Xiao Yu originally stayed at the Datong Hotel. Both Xian Liang Meng were addicted to smoking opium. After returning from the song, late at night, lying on a couch, they accidentally left a cigarette butt, which burned the mosquito net and almost caused a fire. Datong ordered them to leave and asked them to move, so they moved to Yipinxiang). He asked him to extend the performance for one day, which was related to everyone's face. I said that if we break up unhappy, even if you never come south again in your life, why leave such a bad impression? Xiao Yu, due to Yunqing's friendship, could not refuse again and only agreed to sing for one day, posting the whole book "Pearl Curtain Village". That night, before leaving, it was a full house, and everyone was happy. The turbulent situation was dispelled by Yunqing's words. Finally, Yunqing also said that after leaving the Dangui, he and Xu Shaoqing of Tianchan went north in the same car. Shaoqing came specifically to invite Xiao Yu. When they arrived in Ping, they went to his dilapidated mansion together. Xiao Yu happily greeted them and talked about their farewell feelings, but he put Xu aside, as if he did not know him. Yunqing was afraid that Shaoqing would be embarrassed, so he introduced them. Xiao Yu said coldly, "We are already acquaintances." It can be seen that his arrogance was always like this. Soon, Xiao Yu took out his family collection of snuff to give to Yunqing, but the southerners did not like this, so he declined again before accepting it, which is still kept in the box as a souvenir.

### Mei Lanfang's "Cosmic Peak" (Playing Zhao Gao's Daughter)

### Golden Observation After "Battle of Wancheng"

— Master of Aiping Studio

On the night of the third day of the month, a performance of "Battle of Wancheng" was staged, also known as "Horse Trampling on Young Crops" or "Cutting Hair in Lieu of Head," also known as "Zhang Xiu Assassinating His Aunt 1." Among the female roles portraying Zou Shi in this play, Tian Tongqiu (Guifeng) was previously considered the best. Tongqiu's appearance was beautiful, and her acting style and expression were delicate. Her performance in the scene of "Observing Rats and Yearning for Spring" was considered divine and truly worth savoring. Now, however, Little Cuihua is considered the best. Among the male actors playing Zhang Xiu in this play, Yang Xiaolou has always been considered the best. When Old Tan was alive, he also used this play's name, and the one paired with Zou Shi was Tian Guifeng.

On this day, Zou Shi was played by Mao Shilai, with light makeup and heavy powder, looking exactly like a flirtatious widow. In the scene of yearning for spring, her plain clothes were like snow, resembling a pear blossom weeping in the rain. Her searching left and right upon hearing the rat's squeak was quite delicate, truly not allowing Little Cuihua to monopolize the beauty. In the scene of meeting Cao Cao (played by Qiu Shengrong) at Baijing Tower, her eyes conveyed affection. When captured and seeing Cao Cao, she was both surprised and shy, both fearing and loving, fully expressing Zou Shi's inner thoughts of that day. Other aspects, such as her urgency upon hearing the alarming news and her anger at being abandoned, were all conveyed with precision. The scene of being assassinated, crawling on her knees to receive the spear, turning around, and the "Black Dragon Winding Around the Pillar," covering the entire stage, was particularly beautiful and worth watching.

Gao Shenglin's Zhang Xiu put in extraordinary effort on this day. His dialogue and expression when recognizing Cao as his father were neither too much nor too little, just right, completely different from his imposing self when fighting the young general. In each scene, he expressed Zhang Xiu's anger, forbearance, resentment, and various other emotions to the fullest extent. Furthermore, Qiu Shengrong's portrayal of Cao Cao was especially a hundred times more brilliant. The supporting roles, such as Guan Shengxi's Jia Xu, Ai Shiju's Hu Che, and Zhang Lianting's Xu Chu, were all extremely well-suited, making it a truly excellent play.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Decline of Woyun Residence and the Progress of Li Duokui

From then on, he was able to obtain the true essence of the Gong family's expertise even more. Old Gong suffered from many illnesses and was also advanced in age. He hardly attended to matters such as joining troupes and private performances. Sometimes, he would decline engagements and recommend Woyun to take his place. He even transferred his own instrumentalist (Lu Wu) and drummer to Woyun. From this, it can be seen that Old Gong's love and care for his highly talented disciple had reached an extreme. Therefore, around 1920, Woyun Jushi was truly at the height of his popularity, famous throughout Tianjin and Hebei. All those experienced in appreciating opera praised him as the second Gong Chu (Gong Chu, Sun Chu, both were Yunfu, Juxian's stage names when performing as an amateur).

Generally speaking, those who work in the arts should not be too complacent or arrogant. Seeing that Old Gong was increasingly aging and that there was no successor in the old female role category, Woyun became extremely conceited, and his temperament became more and more arrogant day by day. Unexpectedly, around 1925 or 1926, an old female role actress named Li Duokui emerged, and she actually began to compete with him. Speaking of Duokui's history, it was not particularly noble. Although he was also from the world of opera, he was not from the Erhuang troupe. In the past, Guo Baozhen (also known as Old Wu Yuanhong), the leading actor in the role of bearded old man in the Qinqiang opera, had a Huqin player named Li, who was Duokui's uncle. Back then, Guo Baozhen's reputation was on par with Tan Xinpei of the Peking opera troupe, and therefore, Huqin Li's fame was comparable to that of Mei Yutian. The Huqin used in the Bangzi opera troupe is commonly referred to as the "Huqin." Duokui's uncle had extensive knowledge of the Huqin. He was good at vocal accompaniment and followed Guo for a long time. Guo was unwilling to perform on stage without Li's assistance, just like Mei and Tan. Because of the aforementioned reason, Huqin Li was also famous throughout Tianjin and Hebei. Duokui originally studied Bangzi opera, but later, seeing that Qinqiang opera was no longer popular, he switched to studying Erhuang opera with his father. He initially played the role of a bearded old man and became famous in Yantai, Harbin, and other places for performing famous plays such as "Taking Chengdu" and "Wenzhao Pass." He was short in stature but had ample breath, able to sing in the B-flat key. Because he had such a good voice, he was able to gain customer approval everywhere. (43)

Hardy's New Film

### Big Brother Elephant Performed in London

— Huazhi

After the comedic star Laurel and Hardy finished filming "Block-Heads," they suddenly had a disagreement over billing, which eventually led to their breakup. Movie fans all over the world were very sorry because they felt that when they worked together, one fat and one thin, they were a perfect match, but when they separated, they were nothing to watch. Therefore, recently, some people have brought them back together, and Laurel and Hardy have also expressed their approval. The two are expected to re-sign a contract for cooperation. The tired Laurel even gave Hardy a warm kiss on his bald head to celebrate.

During the breakup period, the fat Hardy continued to shoot films, trying to enlist the actress Joan Paige as a pillar, but he didn't know how to start. So he grabbed a few elephants from the zoo to act as partners and pieced together a film called "Big Brother Elephant Never Forget." This film has recently been staged in London. During the production, because the elephant's body was clumsy and there was no gimmick, Hardy had nothing to show except to cling to the elephant's tail and scream or sleep under the elephant's belly. He had already complained bitterly, so he was very happy to work with Laurel again, and he will use the ups and downs of the breakup period as the subject matter of the new film.

### Actors' Activities

Wang Xichun to Film Today. Since the filming of the film "Wen Su Chen" by the All-China Film Company began on June 1, Xiao Wu Wang Xichun was originally scheduled to start filming on the 20th. Later, due to the Dragon Boat Festival, she had to perform daytime shows at the Carlton Grand Theatre, so she requested a postponement. It is now scheduled to start today, filming the "Forest" scene. This beauty has been diligently reading the script for days.

Yang Baotong Will Rehearse Han Xin. Since Yang Baotong joined the Da Jing Ban of Sincere Amusement Park, he has been rehearsing his teacher's masterpiece, Dong Xiaowan, which has been very popular. Now Yang plans to rehearse the entire Han Xie after this play. He was a little ill the other day, with vomiting and diarrhea, but he still performed as usual. Also, the female actress Jiang Yunxia of the troupe, due to a hoarse voice, took leave on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and went to Dr. Zhu Nansheng for treatment.

Gai Junting Returns to Shanghai from Xiamen. The martial arts actor Gai Junting, originally with the Yanping Grand Theater on Gulangyu Island, Xiamen, has now completed his term and left. He returned to Shanghai by the Jinan wheel on the 18th. He and the female actress Qian Shumin are engaged and will be living together in the second half of the year.

Theater News. The New Drama Society Experimental Theater originally planned to perform "Reunion" at the Carlton Theater the day before yesterday (the 18th), but due to incomplete script review procedures, the drama department of the society decided to perform "Love Letter," which had recently been performed at the Youth Association. On the morning of that day, more than nine o'clock, the upper and lower seats were already full, but temporarily due to special circumstances, it could not be performed. The general audience returned with sympathy and disappointment. The tickets sold were voluntarily not refunded. Yesterday, it was heard that the person in charge of the society said that the tickets for that day will still be valid for the performance next week, please do not discard them, and convey our apologies to the audience.

(Chess Talk)

### More on the Titling of Chess Endgames

— (Weihan)

Regarding the naming of chess endgames, Mr. Bao Zibo has already discussed it in this newspaper the other day, but Weihan still feels that there is room for supplementation. There are three principles for naming them: (1) Suitable for the chess situation, such as "Distinguishing Between Chinese and Barbarians" and "Bees and Wasps Unleashing Venom"; (2) Suitable for the number of pieces, such as "Seven Stars Gathering" and "Erlang Subduing Demons"; (3) Suitable for extraordinary times, such as "Resist Aggression to the End," "Final Victory," "Sacrificing Without Regret," and "Losing Virtue and Securing Honor." Because there have been strange and peculiar titles recently, they are listed as follows: (1) For example, "Deceiving the World and Stealing Fame"; (2) Meaningless, such as "Seeing the Strange as Not Strange," "Cherishing One's Own Broom," and "Literature Misleading the Country"; (3) Feudal Ideology, such as "The Emperor's Personal Expedition." Weihan deeply feels this, so he specifically cites them, hoping that friends who submit articles will correct the errors and that those responsible for advocating them will pay special attention.

Old News Newly Copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (67)

(See this newspaper from June of the 11th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

### The Case of Chargerford Shooting a Chinese Person

The case of Chargerford shooting a Chinese person has been thoroughly investigated by Shanghai Magistrate Ye, together with British Judge, Mu Consul, and Yan Deputy Consul, who summoned the original witnesses for interrogation. According to his fellow porter Gu Ronghua, "On that day, Chargerford called six workers to work from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, giving each person 250 cash per day. The deceased's hometown is three miles away from my home, and his name is Zhou Qinqin. The other four are Yan Xixi and Zhu Dasheng, and I don't know their names. That day, the workers worked until 6:00 pm and asked Chargerford for money. He only gave a total of 300 cash. When asked whether the money was to be divided among the six people or given to one person in total, he said it was to be divided among the six people. The deceased argued with him because he had personally promised to pay each worker 250 cash per day, and the amount was insufficient. Chargerford then used his fists and feet and went into the house to fetch a Western rifle. We ran away, going through a small alley to the main road. Looking back from the main road, the deceased was nowhere to be seen. Before reaching the main road, we heard a gunshot. When we returned to look, the deceased was lying on the ground, with blood and flesh flowing." Chargerford's lawyer Luo Pisheng asked who walked out first and who walked out last on that day. Gu Ronghua replied that Yan Xixi and the other four were in front, I was in the middle, and Zhou was in the back. When asked whether the rifle was fired continuously or separately, Gu Ronghua replied that there was one shot, then another. When asked what he did that day, Gu Ronghua replied that he washed seven wooden logs and carried four stones. When asked how much he had received for his work, Gu Ronghua replied that the money was in Zhou Qinqin's hands, and when he was shot and fell to the ground, the money was scattered. The coroner was then questioned, and he said, "On Thursday, I was summoned to examine the body of the Chinese person. One-third of the top of the head had been blown away, and the brain matter and blood were scattered all over the ground. A small pellet was found in the brain, entering the head one inch to the right of the right eye, and the trajectory sloped upward and penetrated to the top of the head." Thereupon, the judge sentenced: "The defendant is convicted, and the sentence was originally intended to be severe. However, considering that the defendant has shown remorse and regret, compensated the family of the deceased with 500 yuan, and that his usual behavior has been proper, the sentence is reduced and set at two years of imprisonment."
