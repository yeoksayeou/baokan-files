### Japanese Blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin: Japanese Soldiers Guard All Border Obstacles; British Ambassador to Japan Visits Arita to Discuss the Tense Situation; the United States and France Guarantee Interests and Take Unified Action with Britain

(Tianjin) The British Concession here has been blockaded from 5:00 AM this morning. Obstacles have been placed at all borders, and soldiers are guarding them. It is reported that the old Tianjin military authorities notified the British Concession yesterday, roughly stating that while the British proposal for a compromise solution is admirable, it is unfortunately too late. The Japanese side has already made various arrangements for the blockade. In such a short period, it is impossible to change the procedures that have already been arranged. (Reuters, 14th)

(Tokyo) The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, visited the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this afternoon to discuss the tense situation in Tianjin. Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki met for several hours today. According to semi-official sources, these three have decided to implement strict policies to deal with foreign concessions in China, as they have become bases for the Chiang Kai-shek regime. (Reuters, 14th)

(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Hull and State Department officials are closely monitoring the Japanese preparations for blockading the British and French Concessions in Tianjin today. It is reported here that the Japanese side has sent a blockade notice to the U.S. Consulate, expressing hope that American merchants will comply with it. (Reuters, 14th)

(Washington) Tianjin is garrisoned by 250 U.S. Marines. There are a total of 400 American residents in the city, and the total number of expatriates under the jurisdiction of the American Consulate in Tianjin is over 1,200. (Havas, 13th)

(Washington) After receiving the declaration from the Japanese military regarding their plan to blockade the British and French Concessions in Tianjin yesterday, the government solemnly stated that the cooperation of the U.S. Navy in the Far East with other navies to protect public interests and maintain order in China has always been a customary practice. The U.S. Marines stationed in various Chinese commercial ports are directly ordered by the U.S. government to protect American interests in China. The State Department is extremely concerned about the development of the situation in Tianjin. Official statistics show that there are 400 American residents in Tianjin, most of whom live in the British and French Concessions. American property in Tianjin is valued at 12 million yuan in legal tender, and the annual business volume of American merchants is valued at 20 million yuan in Chinese and foreign currency. (Associated Press, 14th)

(Paris) The French government officially adopted a serious attitude last night towards the situation caused by the Japanese authorities' blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. A government spokesman declared, "The situation in Tianjin is very tense." He also announced that France has discussed with Britain and the United States a unified action regarding the interests of third countries in Tianjin. French officials recalled that French defense commanders in the Far East were invited to Singapore for a joint British naval and military conference. Officials indicated that this conference may have significant implications for the Tianjin situation. (Associated Press, 14th)

(Tianjin) Today, the Japanese are continuing their blockade of the concessions. As a result, the areas along the concession borders are becoming increasingly crowded with people and vehicles. Although food is allowed to be brought into the concessions, the transfer procedures are slow due to the excessive crowding of people and vehicles at the Japanese sentry posts. Although foreigners are searched when passing through the Japanese sentry lines, no foreign property has been confiscated so far. The foreign business community is now feeling the impact of the blockade, and staff numbers have been reduced to a minimum. At the same time, Chinese employees of various businesses in the concessions did not go to locations outside the concessions today. (Associated Press, 14th) The British and French governments are now in close contact and carefully studying the situation in Tianjin. What decisions will be made is kept secret by officials. However, according to Le Figaro, Britain and France have decided on a joint action plan. (Reuters, 14th)

The Japanese Side Presents Five Demands

(Tianjin) British and other foreign women and children who did not want to be trapped in the British Concession during the current hot summer months left in large numbers yesterday after the Japanese side announced the blockade of the British Concession starting at 6:00 AM today. Most of them went to Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao, but quite a few also went to Beiping. Japanese newspapers stated that only those with official business in the concession would be exempt from searches when entering or leaving. One Japanese official said that food could be freely transported into the concession. The general British population has decided not to be seriously threatened by this, but the general sentiment is anger rather than fear. British light infantry patrolled the borders of the concession in trucks. From 6:00 AM this morning, all pedestrian and vehicle traffic between the Japanese Concession, Tianjin City, and the British and French Concessions has been cut off. The International Bridge will not be allowed to be crossed from 6:00 AM until midnight, and traffic will be blocked on the other six roads from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Japanese personnel are stationed at these seven locations to search pedestrians and vehicles. Ships on the Hai River must also stop at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf or be searched by Japanese personnel. In addition to demanding the extradition of the four suspects in the assassination case, the Japanese are now demanding that the British abandon their pro-Chiang Kai-shek policy, namely, not to: protect anti-Japanese and pro-Communist elements; assist Chinese legal tender, causing Allied Reserve notes to be affected; monopolize goods; allow illegal elements to use wireless communications; and permit schools to use anti-Japanese textbooks. (Reuters, 14th)

Stringent Inspections and a Silent Street Scene

(Tianjin) Today, since the Japanese side implemented the blockade of the foreign concessions, nationals of Germany, Italy, and the United States have not encountered much difficulty. However, British and Chinese people wishing to enter or leave the British and French concessions are subjected to strict searches. British people must also answer questions and submit nationality documents for inspection. It is reported that some Chinese people were asked to undress in the guard rooms for inspection, but foreigners have not been subjected to this treatment. A British man named Meyer, a film cameraman who was on board the U.S. gunboat Panay when it was bombed in the Yangtze River in December 1937, was arrested by the Japanese side for taking photographs on the International Bridge and is still in custody tonight. Although the British authorities have tried to rescue him, they have been unsuccessful. However, Major Lau, who was arrested yesterday for taking photographs in the former Russian Concession, has been released after negotiations by the British authorities and is now awaiting a ship to Dalian. The Japanese side has declared martial law on the Hai River, prohibiting ships from traveling between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM. A tugboat belonging to the Dagukou Tugboat Company was stopped by the Japanese side outside the border of the British Concession this morning while sailing downstream. It was released after a thorough search. When the ship returned, it was searched again at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf, only a few minutes apart from the previous search. The crew was not harassed. No other foreign ships have been reported to have moved today. The situation at the borders of the foreign concessions has not changed. The concessions are quite empty, and the streets are silent, unlike the usual hustle and bustle. A Reuters reporter toured the southern border of the British Concession this morning and saw that the Japanese allowed people leaving the concession to enter the former German Concession via Wilson Street, while those entering the concession were instructed to use Shanxi Road, a squalid side street about half a mile south. There were many people standing in line at the seven Japanese checkpoints this morning waiting to be inspected, some lines as long as half a mile. The search procedures were so slow that many people were unable to get to their offices on time. Although some vegetables were transported into the British Concession this morning, the municipal council vegetable market was almost completely without supplies. Food prices have soared, with some prices increasing by 70% today. Although the Japanese side superficially allows food to be transported into the concession, Chinese vendors dare not attempt to supply the blockaded area with food for fear of being accused of being anti-Japanese elements. Today, the local newspaper published regulations regarding entry into the British and French Concessions, stating that only those with an absolute need to enter the foreign areas will be allowed to enter, except for foreigners holding consulate passes. All goods and vehicles must be inspected. (Reuters, 14th)

German and Italian Vehicles Freely Enter and Exit

(Tianjin) The Japanese garrison in Tianjin began blockading the British and French concessions from 5:00 AM today and stationed troops at the main roads leading into the concessions. The import of goods into Tianjin has currently come to a halt. Pedestrians on the street must undergo strict searches by Japanese soldiers before they can enter or leave the two concessions. The Japanese side conducts inspections on all pedestrians regardless of nationality, and each person is searched for 15 minutes. Therefore, after leaving the concession once, it takes three hours to return to the concession. However, cars flying the flags of Germany and Italy can freely pass through the blockade without the trouble of inspection. Furthermore, in the interest of mutual concession, the British side suggested setting up an international committee to determine whether the four Chinese suspects in the assassination case should indeed be handed over to the Japanese side. The committee members would consist of one person each from Britain, Japan, and a neutral country, with the chairman being a neutral party. However, the Japanese authorities here have now rejected this proposal. The British Volunteer Corps (i.e., the merchant corps) in this city were fully mobilized yesterday to provide security. However, because the situation was quite peaceful, the corps members returned home to rest. Also, the streets of the two concessions are quite deserted today, as rickshaws have disappeared and commerce with the outside world has effectively stopped. (Associated Press, 14th)

The Japanese Intention is Obvious

(Tokyo) The Cabinet discussed the situation in Tianjin last night, and Foreign Minister Arita reported on Japan's determination to respond to the situation. The Yomiuri Shimbun recently commented on the British compromise proposal, stating that Japan's goal is not just the issue of one British concession in Tianjin. Japan has now begun to address the entire issue of foreign concessions in China and the Far Eastern policies of Britain and France. It is reported that Britain recently proposed forming a three-person committee, with one British person, one Japanese person, and a neutral person as chairman, to determine whether the four people demanded by the Japanese side are guilty and should be extradited. (Reuters, 14th)

(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman recently declared that controlling currency is one of the main reasons for blockading the Tianjin concession, and stated that if anyone is found to possess illegal paper money, it will be confiscated immediately. However, if foreign banks can cooperate with the "North China United Reserve Bank," the Japanese attitude can be eased. The spokesman also stated that the blockade of the concession is not intended to obstruct the transport of food, and that the Tianjin authorities' rejection of the British compromise conditions was not discussed with Tokyo beforehand. As for the extradition of the assassination suspects, it is a secondary issue, as Japan's biggest demand is that Britain guarantee that it will not interfere with Japan's policy toward China. (Associated Press, 14th)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo reports that at a meeting on the 14th, key cabinet members decided that Japan should continue to advance its predetermined policy on the issue of foreign concessions in China. Foreign Minister Arita met with Prime Minister Hiranuma at 2:00 AM, and Army Minister Itagaki is also scheduled to continue talks with Hiranuma and Arita in the afternoon to exchange views on the Japanese measures after the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. (14th Dispatch)

(Tokyo) Both the Nichinichi Shimbun and the Yomiuri Shimbun stated that merely handing over the suspects in the assassination case would not resolve the Tianjin incident. Local Japanese authorities will continue to isolate the British and French concessions in Tianjin until the British consider their attitude. If the British are unwilling to create a new order in East Asia with Japan, the blockade will continue. Japanese newspapers generally stated that the government will proceed with its established policy toward foreign concessions in China, as foreign concessions have proven to be a major obstacle to Japan's efforts to establish a new order in East Asia. (Reuters, 14th)

(Tianjin) The Japanese-appointed mayor of Tianjin issued a declaration today, roughly stating that the British have been detained, and that we can proceed with our work of establishing a new order in East Asia. (Associated Press, 14th)

Members of the House of Commons Raise Questions

(London) In the British House of Commons today, after Foreign Undersecretary Butler made a brief statement, members raised questions about the serious situation in Tianjin, indicating their concern. Labor MP Noel-Baker asked the government whether it could tell the Japanese government that if the Japanese authorities continue their current actions toward the public concessions, it will inevitably produce extremely serious consequences. Butler replied that he thought the Japanese authorities were aware of the British government's attitude. Conservative MP Milner asked whether it would be possible to establish a court or use the existing court in the British Concession to try the suspects based on all the evidence, and whether this could be done in the future. Butler replied that the Japanese demand for the extradition of the four suspects in the assassination case has special circumstances, and the government will consider any possible solutions. Labor MP Bellenger said that if the government issued a firm statement declaring that the government would not tolerate the Japanese blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin, he and the House of Commons would welcome it. Butler replied that he intended Bellenger to reconsider his statement that "the situation is serious, but negotiations are still ongoing, and a solution is expected." (Reuters, 13th)

(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Moreing asked whether the government would immediately notify the Japanese government that if they did not stop the blockade, they would deny the Japanese the right to use the ports of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Penang. Foreign Undersecretary Butler replied that the question of what means would be most appropriate to deal with the current blockade is currently under study, and part of it will depend on the nature of the actions taken by the Japanese side. Labor MP Bellenger continued to ask whether British expatriates in the Tianjin concession had experienced any suffering due to the lack of food or rising prices. Butler replied that he had heard that the Japanese had no intention of cutting off the supply of food to the foreign concessions in Tianjin, and that he could report on food prices if notified. Conservative MP Milner also asked whether the government intended to make further statements on this matter today or within days. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax was awaiting official information on the current situation and would be willing to inform the House of Commons as soon as possible. Liberal MP Mander asked whether the government was in close contact with the French and American governments regarding the handling of the Tianjin dispute. Butler replied, "Honorable members can rest assured that we are in close contact with the French and American governments." (Reuters, 14th)

Foreign Minister Wang Issues a Statement Yesterday

(Chongqing) Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, when meeting with a Reuters reporter today, issued the following statement regarding the Japanese blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin, "The Japanese blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin, the detention of British military attaché in China, Mr. Spears, the killing of British expatriate Mr. Tingle, and the incitement of anti-British actions, are intended to test the extent to which their declared policy of seizing all foreign concessions and settlements can be implemented. Japan does not even respect the rights and interests of its allies in the Anti-Comintern Pact. If they are allowed to achieve their goals through blatant seizure and allowed to continuously infringe upon foreign interests, the future status of all countries within the areas under Japanese jurisdiction will be bleak. Those aggressors who first invaded China are now encroaching on third countries. It is a mistake to think that satisfying the demands of the Japanese can resolve the situation created by this aggression, as the aggressors are only waiting for a suitable opportunity to completely close the 'Open Door' and drive all Western forces out of Asia." Wang concluded, "If all countries can collectively stop buying Japanese goods and prohibit all access to Japan, without letting their interests and rights be trampled upon, then Japanese threats can be eliminated." (Reuters, 14th)

(Chongqing) The United Daily News here today published an article criticizing the Tianjin situation, urging the British and French authorities to adopt a firm attitude towards the current situation in Tianjin and warn the Japanese side, and urging the British and French authorities to discuss effective joint action with the United States as soon as possible, while accelerating the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to resist aggression. (Reuters, 14th)

The Bad Precedent of Blockade Cannot Be Allowed to Exist

(Paris) The situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been commented on by various newspapers here. The right-wing Le Figaro published a dispatch from its correspondent in London stating, "The British Concession in Tianjin, with its tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign residents, has been blockaded by the Japanese army, setting a bad precedent. In the future, the Japanese military authorities may use this as a precedent and further blockade all Chinese ports that still have foreign concessions in the same way. The British government has decided to adopt a firm attitude to deal with this because the interests held by France in Tianjin are as important as those of Britain. The two governments are maintaining close contact and have decided in principle to take joint action." The right-wing Le Temps stated, "The threat posed by the Japanese military blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin is a scene in the struggle between Japan and the Western countries. A Japanese military spokesman said that even if a solution is found to the current dispute in Tianjin, the friendship between Britain and Japan may not be restored as a result. This statement is noteworthy. It seems that Japan intends for Britain and France to refuse to aid China and abolish the concession system in China. In addition, although Japan has not joined the German-Italian alliance, it does its best to support any initiatives launched by Germany and Italy. It would not be unreasonable to say that this incident was instigated by the German-Italian axis." (Havas, 14th)

(London) Today, all newspapers highlighted the blockade of Tianjin as the main news, with large headlines, maps, and detailed accounts of the Japanese army's repeated violations of British interests in North China. It is reported that the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have rejected the British proposal for a joint committee to resolve the Tianjin dispute. Reuters has learned that the Japanese government's reply to the British government takes the attitude that the case is of a local nature and should be resolved locally. It is also learned that the British government is currently closely considering the steps it will take next. Officials are silent on the countermeasures they will take, but have firmly stated that the Japanese blockade is unforgivable and that the British government has no intention of submitting tamely. The British and French governments are currently conducting consultations. It is believed here that the French government will support any plan that the British government deems necessary. Reuters has learned that the U.S. government has ordered the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin to chair the joint committee proposed by the British and to make every effort to mediate and find a solution to the British-Japanese dispute. An authority on Far Eastern affairs told a Reuters reporter today, "We are now adhering purely to moral principles in this issue of extraditing the four Chinese people demanded by the Japanese side. This move will surely arouse goodwill among the Chinese towards the British, while the Japanese hope to make both the British and the Chinese lose face. This move also seems likely to give Americans a good impression." Furthermore, according to responsible sources, the Japanese side clearly intends to use the excuse of refusing to extradite the Chinese people to implement its aggressive plan, the purpose of which is to allow the Japanese to gain economic and financial control of foreign trade in Tianjin. As for the "new order" claimed by the Japanese side, it has so far only proven harmful to British interests, so those foreigners who wish to trade freely with China under existing treaties are not welcome. (Reuters, 14th)

British Newspapers Still Hope for a Diplomatic Solution

(London) The Daily Mail has recently commented on the situation in Tianjin, China, stating that the matter can be resolved through diplomatic channels. "Japan does not want to cause new disputes in the Far East, and Britain is also busy dealing with European events and also hopes to avoid disputes." (Havas, 14th)

(London) Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, a diplomatic affairs reporter for the Financial Times recently declared, "The British and American governments have conducted consultations on this matter. The U.S. government has agreed to have its consul-general in Tianjin serve as chairman of the joint British-Japanese committee. In addition, there are three members, including one representative each from the British and American governments. This method of organizing a committee to resolve the difficulties is being sought for approval from the Japanese government. After its establishment, the committee will decide whether the four Chinese currently detained in the British Concession, who are accused by the Japanese of being responsible for several recent assassinations in Tianjin, should be handed over to a court outside the British Concession. Therefore, the Japanese 'threat of blockade may not last.'" (Havas, 14th)

The Japanese Side Refuses to Form an Arbitration Committee

(London) Regarding the demand of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, China, that the British Concession authorities extradite four Chinese, officials here recently stated that the British proposal to form an arbitration committee has been rejected by the Japanese side. Sources close to the Foreign Office stated that this dispute is a pretext used by the Japanese, and that their intention is to pressure foreigners to cooperate with the new regime in North China, thereby controlling the economy and finances of Tianjin.

Editorial

### The Japanese Army Actually Implements a Blockade of the British and French Concessions

From 6:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese army in Tianjin has implemented a blockade of the British and French concessions. This kind of blockade is entirely an act of coercion and humiliation, and naturally there is no legal basis to speak of. The impact of the blockade will be that all industries and businesses based in the British and French concessions of Tianjin will come to a complete standstill; the lives of both Chinese and foreign residents within the concessions will also suffer greatly. This is another chapter in the blatant attacks by Japan on the rights and interests of European and American countries in China since the Sino-Japanese War.

Japan's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin this time is under the pretext that the British side refused Japan's demand to extradite the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng; however, the spokesperson of the Japanese army in Tianjin yesterday also stated that even if the British side handed over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, this problem could not be resolved; unless the British concession authorities cooperate with the Japanese side to jointly establish a "New Order in East Asia" and abandon all policies of aiding the Chinese government. Therefore, the compromise proposed by the British side, namely, to organize a joint committee to discuss the extradition issue together, has also been rejected by the Japanese side.

Analyzing Japan's blockade of the Tianjin concessions this time, there are two points that particularly deserve attention: First, the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin is only a part of Japan's surgical operation to resolve the issue of concessions in China; in the future, concessions in other places may also suffer the same fate. This inference is based on: (1) the statement made yesterday by the spokesperson of the Japanese army in Tianjin; (2) the Kyoto Shimbun previously propagated that Japan's real enemy is not in China, but in the concessions within China; (3) according to the remarks made by Suzuki, the so-called Minister of Political Affairs of the Japan Prosperity Institute yesterday, under Japan's construction of a "New Order", all countries should return the concessions in China; the current concessions hinder the construction of the New Order and are truly hostile acts that Japan can hardly tolerate. These three different expressions very clearly express Japan's intention towards concessions in various places, and its determination to seize them for itself. Now the British and French concessions in Tianjin have already suffered Japan's blockade; and when the British Parliament discussed the Far East issue the other day, it regarded July 7th of this year as the most dangerous date for the Shanghai concessions; at the same time, here in Shanghai, it is also rumored that the Japanese authorities have instructed Japanese residents in the concessions to move to the north of the Suzhou Creek. Although we cannot imagine that Shanghai will one day fall into the same situation as Tianjin, we can at least assert that it is a mistake to regard the concessions as impregnable strongholds and happy lands.

Secondly, recently, an anti-British movement has generally occurred within Japan and in the guerrilla areas of China controlled by the Japanese army; and cases of harm and insult to British officials and civilians in various places are even more numerous; this time the Japanese army's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin seems to be specifically aimed at Britain, so the Japanese consul in Tianjin had previously requested understanding from the consulates of other countries in Tianjin and indicated that the food needed by American residents after the blockade could be supplied by the Japanese side. This kind of action by Japan is undoubtedly a divisive tactic. If Japan wants to complete its New Order, it must first exclude British interests in the Far East, and then exclude the interests of the United States, France, and other countries in the Far East; now Japan is only attacking the British side in Tianjin, and it is by no means abandoning its attempt to exclude the interests of other countries in the Far East, but is afraid of the cooperation of Britain, France, and the United States. It can only temporarily make the anti-American and anti-French work as the second or third step in excluding European and American interests in China.

How can the European and American countries not deeply understand Japan's ambition and intention? It's just that they have not yet taken effective countermeasures. Especially Britain, which is bearing the brunt. Based on past experience, it should be known that this Tianjin incident cannot be resolved by compromise unless Britain is willing to withdraw from the Far East; if it is still believed that this incident is due to the extradition of the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, it would be a great mistake. The British Foreign Secretary said in a speech the other day that he would never recognize the unilateral changes to the various treaties in the Far East, and would do everything possible to defend British interests in China; if he wants to solve this problem by extraditing the suspects, it would be tantamount to tearing up the various treaties in the Far East with his own hands, and cutting off his own interests in China. It should be known that only by using action to stop the actions of aggressors is the most effective way. The Gulangyu incident is an example. According to the telegraphic news from Paris and Washington yesterday, the French and American governments have both stated that their respective navies in the Far East will cooperate with Britain to jointly protect their interests in the Far East. The Tianjin concessions incident may be the most appropriate time to prompt the British and American countries to protect their interests with action!

### The Chinese Army in Western Shanxi Launches a General Attack on Lishi, Recovering it as Soon as Reinforcements Arrive, Fierce Battles for Days Result in Over 10,000 Japanese Casualties

(Chongqing) Chinese military sources stated that the Chinese army in Western Shanxi won a great victory yesterday, and after three days of fierce fighting, recovered the important Yellow River towns of Jundu and Liulin. This is the result of the encirclement of Lishi from northern Shanxi. The Japanese army's transportation between Lishi and Liulin has been cut off, so the victory could be achieved quickly. Now the Chinese army is launching a general attack on Lishi, and it can be recovered in one go when reinforcements arrive (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 14th).

(Chongqing) According to news received here, as a result of the fierce fighting in Liulin and Jundu in Western Shanxi in recent days, the Japanese army suffered more than 10,000 casualties (Tong News Agency dispatch on the 14th).

After the Japanese army in Yuanqu, southern Shanxi, launched six incursions into Zhongtiao Mountain and suffered heavy blows from the Chinese army, more than 2,000 Japanese troops in Zhangdian and 2,300 Japanese troops south of Yanchi have retreated eastward to Anyi. However, there are still a few remnants in Da Chencun (south of Zhangdian) attempting to operate in Lingjiao Village. The Chinese army has advanced to encircle and attack them, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them (dispatch on the 13th).

The Chinese Army of Hebei and Eastern Henan Advances on Tong County

(Zhengzhou) The Chinese army of Hebei and Eastern Henan, since the combined civilian army of Mafengzhen defeated the Japanese Tabe garrison in Tong County, has gained great momentum. Since the 6th, it has successively occupied Shuangmatou, Xu Xinzhuang, Caoshi, Pangcun and other places north of Tong County, and is now continuing to advance towards the city of Tong County. Another unit of the Chinese army captured Jiajiading (south of Tong County) and the Tianjiafu area on the evening of the 6th. The Japanese Tabe garrison stationed in Tong County is firmly defending the city walls and dare not meet the enemy. The situation of a large encirclement has now been formed (dispatch on the 14th).

The Chinese Army in Jiangmen and Xinhui Engages in a Counteroffensive

(Hong Kong) The Chinese army under Deng Longguang in Jiangmen and Xinhui is launching a counteroffensive against the Japanese army. This afternoon, the Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in fierce fighting east of Duruan on the Xinhui-Heshan Road and south of Tangxia on the Jiangmen-Foshan Road. Cannon fire was heard in Shiqi. There was also fierce fighting west of Huicheng, and the cannon fire did not stop until night (special dispatch on the 14th).

At 8:00 AM on the 11th, eight to nine hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry who invaded Dajing'ao were intercepted by the Chinese army in different directions. After fierce fighting until about 6:00 PM, the Japanese army could not hold out and abandoned more than a hundred corpses and retreated to Hemu. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them (dispatch on the 14th).

At 8:00 PM on the 12th, four Japanese shallow-water warships and more than ten motorboats, carrying a part of the Japanese army, sneaked from the waters of Waihai (east of Xinhui) and Guzhen (west of Zhongshan) to the river surface, attempting to land near Xiaolan. The Chinese army met them head-on and dealt them a heavy blow. Before the Japanese army could respond, they scurried back to the warships. Five motorboats were sunk by the Chinese army, and many Japanese soldiers fell into the water and drowned (dispatch on the 14th).

The Chinese Army in Western Zhejiang Attacks and Enters Xianlin

The Chinese army in Western Zhejiang attacked Xianlin. On the 4th, they attacked and entered Panlong Mountain, burning all of the Japanese gasoline depots. The Japanese Hasegawa unit was killed by the Chinese army by more than sixty people. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them and immediately attacked and entered Xianlin, killing hundreds of Japanese troops and capturing many military supplies (special dispatch on the 14th).

### On the Issue of Persevering in the War of Resistance, President Kong Expresses His Views, This War of Resistance is a Decisive Battle for the Survival of the Nation, It Will Not Stop Until Japan Abandons Its Aggression

(Chongqing) President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi expressed his views on the issue of "Persevering in the War of Resistance, Self-Reliance and Regeneration" at 7:00 PM on the 14th. The main points are as follows:

Tonight, I will briefly describe to my compatriots across the country the recent political situation of the central government and the current situation of the War of Resistance, and extend my heartfelt condolences and sincere expectations. The War of Resistance has been going on for nearly two years. The suffering and brutality suffered by our compatriots under the hail of bullets are always in the government's thoughts. Since ancient times, there have been many disputes between countries, but in civilized countries, the army, except for taking hostile actions against combatants, never arbitrarily abuses civilians. However, Japanese soldiers have wantonly killed the people of neighboring countries, creating a tragic scene unprecedented in human history. The government feels infinite sorrow for this tragic scene. The reason why it does not shirk hard work, does not avoid the responsibility of leading the people, and endures painful sacrifices is because it has decided that this War of Resistance is the final decisive battle for the survival and continuation of our nation. If we cannot endure the current pain, we will incur the tragic disaster of national subjugation. Therefore, we can only adhere to our position and resist to the end in order to save the nation, survive, revive, and build the country. War is originally a difficult thing. Japan is one of the strongest countries in the world. Our War of Resistance against Japan is fighting the strong with the weak. Engaging in a large-scale war within our own territory means that all sacrifices and pains are unavoidable. Fortunately, under the leadership of the Supreme Leader, the soldiers and civilians across the country have overcome difficulties and become more and more courageous in battle, so that all of the Japanese's strategic and political conspiracies have been shattered. The Japanese, seeing that the military situation is difficult and the environment is dangerous, deeply know that continuing to fight for a long time will cause their country to fall into a state of complete collapse. Recently, they deliberately spread the air of peace, used puppets as their echoers, and tried to induce our compatriots in the lost areas to make calls for peace, attempting to deceive the world and induce our military's morale, in order to end the war as soon as possible and achieve war results through political means. Unfortunately, some people have fallen into the Japanese trap due to being driven by a psychology of fear of difficulty and seeking temporary peace, and have destroyed their own positions and worked for the enemy. This is really a very regrettable thing. Compatriots, in this regard, you should know that the current suffering is the result of our nation's centuries of inaction, laxity, and failure to rejuvenate itself. If we are still afraid of difficulty and seek temporary peace, and are coerced and induced to compromise midway, cutting off the precious foundation that our ancestors left us, the result will inevitably make our descendants suffer the shame of national subjugation for all generations. Therefore, we must abandon our fluke mentality, willingly endure all the pain, "persevere in the War of Resistance, be self-reliant and regenerate." Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to the national revolution, and his goal was to seek freedom and equality for China. This is the legitimate demand of our entire people, and it is also the goal that the government has always worked towards. The Chinese nation has always been known for its love of peace, so the policies of successive governments have always been based on peace. Even when the national strength was at its peak, it never invaded neighboring countries. Japan has the same script and race as us. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has repeatedly received our support. Even in modern diplomatic history, all the rights and interests that the great powers can enjoy in our country have been enjoyed by Japan. In recent years, Japan has used various means within our country to obtain many special interests. Our government has endured all kinds of grievances, and its purpose is nothing more than to maintain peace. Unfortunately, Japan's national policy is fundamentally not to coexist with us. In order to strive for the independence and survival of the nation, we cannot but endure all sacrifices and rise up to resist the war. This is a decisive battle between the national policies of China and Japan, and there is an inevitable trend. Our War of Resistance work cannot be stopped until Japan abandons its policy of aggression (to be continued).

### American Youths Ridicule Jewish Children

Swastikas Tattooed on Foreheads - Influenced by Nazi Propaganda

An elementary school student from Baltimore, USA, of Jewish descent, only fourteen years old, was seized today by more than forty rowdy children in a remote alley here. They used a small knife to carve the letter "H" on his neck (H is the first letter of Hebrew, indicating that the child is Jewish). They then used purple ink to print a swastika on his forehead. After being injured, he rushed to the hospital bleeding profusely for treatment. The authorities immediately began an investigation and have arrested eighteen of the offending children. It has also been discovered that there is a youth association here that communicates with the German-American Association, and all its actions are influenced by Nazi propaganda.

Italian-Bulgarian Negotiations Proceeding

Renewal of Clearing Agreement

Capital of Bulgaria: The Bulgarian trade delegation arrived in Rome yesterday to prepare for negotiations with Italy to renew the Italian-Bulgarian clearing agreement. The old agreement is about to expire in the near future. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

### Balkan Nations Should Unite Romanian Foreign Minister's Earnest Advice Appears Aimed at Bulgaria

Capital of Turkey: Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, in a speech to reporters today, stated that a Balkan Consultation Pact, including all countries of the Balkan Peninsula, does not discriminate against any country and is not directed at any other country. All those who sympathize with our open-door policy and wish to join the Balkan Consultation are welcome. Our resolute implementation of this policy is not due to a recognition of our weakness. On the contrary, we are determined to strengthen the Consultation Group. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu shares the same sentiments with me, believing that the unity, independence, and peace of the Balkan countries must be safeguarded. From now on, Romania and Turkey will rely on each other. (Havas News Agency, 13th)

### British Cabinet Considers Establishing an Intelligence Department

Provoking Malicious Criticism from the German Press

Described as a Revival of the Northcliffe Policy

(London) The British Cabinet will meet today to consider a proposal to establish an intelligence department dedicated to handling foreign intelligence, so as to present the British side's reasoning to the world in a more effective manner. The former British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Percy Loraine, will assume an important role in this new agency, as he is well-versed in international affairs and has extensive experience as the former Secretary-General of the League of Nations. If the Cabinet approves this proposal, the department will have a spokesperson. The current planning scope is limited, only for peacetime needs, but in wartime, the scope of operations will need to be expanded. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)

(Berlin) The proposal to establish an intelligence department in Britain has aroused negative criticism from the German newspapers, describing it as a revival of Lord Northcliffe's manipulative tactics. The Berlin local newspaper stated that this move is a hostile plan directed against Germany. Britain's so-called peace is highly questionable, which is even more evident here. Why is Britain taking this step? It is simply because no one takes seriously the British cabinet members' statement that Britain is prepared to negotiate with Germany. Therefore, Britain wants to interfere more directly in Germany's internal affairs in the name of peace, in addition to the encirclement policy. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)

### Overseas Chinese Contributions to the Motherland Last Year Cash and Material Donations Totaling 60 Million Yuan

San Francisco: In 1938, the total contribution of overseas Chinese from all over the United States to the motherland amounted to 60 million yuan, including both cash and materials. This estimate is based on reports from both China and the donation locations. It is said that this remittance has doubled compared to the previous highest figure. A total of 10 million overseas Chinese participated in the remittance, which has greatly benefited the maintenance of China's resistance and foreign exchange. It is reported that the funds donated by overseas Chinese to the Chinese government totaled 120 million yuan, mostly contributed by overseas Chinese in Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines, with the contributions from overseas Chinese in the Western Hemisphere amounting to 27 million yuan. As for other material contributions, there were medicines, ambulances, etc. At the same time, hundreds of experts trained abroad have also returned to China to serve. As for individuals, Hu Wenhu stands out. Not only did Mr. Hu donate money and medicines to the country, but he also invested 50 million yuan in Southwest enterprises.

### Hungarian Regent Explains Diplomatic Policy Maintaining Independence as a Goal Maintaining Friendly Relations with Neighboring Countries

Hungarian Capital: Regent Horthy delivered a speech in the House of Representatives today, discussing diplomatic issues. He stated that Hungary is determined to safeguard its independence and freedom, maintain faith with all friendly countries, and is willing to establish new friendships. Our country has harmonious relations with Germany and Italy, and the relationship with Poland is also very friendly, inherited through generations, and unshakable. As for Yugoslavia, the relationship between us is based on mutual trust and should be promoted at every opportunity. In short, Hungary seeks only peace. After the major powers have resolved their own issues, the issues related to various small countries should be submitted for discussion. It would also be acceptable if the Pope presided over this matter. Regarding internal affairs, he said that the government's policy should focus on agricultural and social reform. (Havas News Agency, 14th)

### Germany Expands Military Preparations Heavy Taxes People's Grievances

(Berlin) German Finance Minister Reinhardt, in response to frequent complaints from the business community about heavy taxes, specifically explained the reasons why taxes cannot be reduced at a meeting of merchants today. He said that if Germany's military preparations were carried out over many years, the costs could indeed be lower. However, last year, other countries might have inflicted war on Germany. If so, the cost of war would be many times greater than the cost of military preparations. It is estimated that tax revenue this year will reach 22,000,000,000 marks, compared to 18,000,000,000 marks in 1938 and 7,000,000,000 marks in 1932. It is predicted that revenue in 1940 will be higher than in 1939. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)

### US Foreign Policy Association's Prediction on World War II Britain and France to Receive Full US Assistance Global Economic Power to Further Concentrate in the United States

(Washington) According to the US Foreign Policy Association's prediction, the outcome of a second European war will inevitably create an orderly new world. There will be some changes in European democracies, while the United States will occupy a dominant position in the Western Hemisphere and the Far East. This prediction is part of a report by the association's economic expert, Mr. Kress. According to Mr. Kress, "In the second European war, the United States will still strictly maintain neutrality, but Britain and France will be able to obtain sufficient gold and other assistance from the United States, which can support the war for at least two years. However, if the war extends to more than two years, all countries may permanently abandon gold as the basis of their currency system. In short, as a result of the United States maintaining neutrality, the economic power of all countries will inevitably further concentrate in the United States. Also, as a result of the war, the world will inevitably be divided into two major parts. On the one hand, all belligerent countries will adopt economic systems similar to those of the Soviet Union and Germany. The neutral countries of Europe will inevitably integrate their economic lives with those of the belligerent countries. On the other hand, other countries, under the leadership of the United States, will become a free international economic base." (Associated Press News Agency, 13th)

### Strang Arrives in Moscow British-Soviet Negotiations Resume Baltic States Guarantee Issue Soviet Union Still Insists on Original Position

(Moscow) Sterndale Bennet, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, leading a team to assist the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, in negotiating the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, arrived here from Warsaw at 11:00 AM today. Rooth, Director of the Western European Department of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, a representative of the Protocol Department, Bonikov, and Counsellor Fanlig of the British Embassy were all at the station to welcome them. It is reported that Sterndale Bennet will meet with Ambassador Seeds tomorrow to begin talks with Foreign Minister Molotov. At that time, the First Deputy Foreign Minister, Potemkin, will serve as interpreter. (Havas News Agency, 14th)

(Moscow) On the eve of the arrival of Sterndale Bennet, the special representative of the British Foreign Office, bringing instructions regarding the Anglo-Franco-Soviet anti-aggression pact to Ambassador Seeds, the Soviet government's mouthpiece, "Pravda," commented on the negotiations to be held today, still insisting that Latvia, Estonia, and Finland must accept the Soviet guarantee, stating that the neutrality of the Baltic states is crucial to the security of the Soviet Union. These three countries are unable to resist aggression, so they need a guarantee from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The attitudes of Estonian Foreign Minister Selter and Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko, who oppose the Soviet guarantee, are likely due to German incitement. If so, what we are encountering is an understanding or conspiracy to destroy the defensive line of anti-aggression countries. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)

(London) According to today's "Daily Express," a joint declaration by Britain, France, and Poland on the status of Danzig will be issued soon. It is reported that Sterndale Bennet, the Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, discussed this matter with the British Ambassador to Poland during his visit to Warsaw on his way to Moscow. Informed sources believe that Britain, France, and Poland will submit a proposal to Germany regarding changing the status of Danzig in the near future, but it can be asserted that the proposal will definitely not be to return Danzig to Germany.

Switzerland Decides to Resume Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union

Swiss Capital: The House of Representatives recently passed a motion with 70 votes in favor and 33 votes against, supporting Switzerland's resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

(Havas News Agency, 13th)

### German-Italian Coddling of Spain London Quite Anxious Preliminary Success in Italian-Spanish Treaty Negotiations Ciano Scheduled to Visit Spain Next Month

(London) The relationship between Spain and the German-Italian axis is gradually becoming closer. The fact that the Spanish Interior Minister Suner visited Rome, and the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will visit Spain next month in return, and that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, is also said to visit Rome at the end of September, can serve as evidence. Government insiders here are quite anxious. According to reliable sources, Spain signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression with Germany and Italy respectively at the end of March, on the eve of Spain's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, stipulating that they would not aid each other's enemies in wartime. Now, Germany and Italy are trying to urge General Franco to sign a closer agreement, which is supported by Spanish Interior Minister Suner, but most people in the Spanish government oppose it. It is likely that this matter will not be decided before General Franco visits Italy at the end of September. If Spain is determined to join the German-Italian axis at that time, the international situation will inevitably become more dangerous again. Fortunately, Spain's relationship with Britain is still friendly and without gaps, and its relationship with France is also expected to improve, so that Britain can engage in diplomatic activities to strengthen the position of those in the Spanish government who oppose joining the German-Italian axis. (Havas News Agency, 13th)

(Rome) Spanish Interior Minister Suner returned to his country by plane today. It is reported that as a result of Suner's visit to Italy, the two sides have established a cultural agreement. (Havas News Agency, 14th)

(Rome) According to people close to the Italian government, the talks conducted by Interior Minister Suner are only preliminary in nature, for exchanging opinions on the conclusion of a cultural and economic agreement between Italy and Spain. Once Foreign Minister Ciano travels to that country in mid-next month, the negotiations can be completed, and the formal signing ceremony will be held when General Franco comes here for a visit at the end of September. In short, the friendly relationship between that country and the German-Italian axis is becoming increasingly close, which is gratifying. (Havas News Agency, 13th)

### Rumor that Hitler Will Launch a New Violent Coup Germany Says It Does Not Intend to Change the Current System in Slovakia

(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Herald" wrote today that he expects Hitler to implement a new violent coup within a few days, that is, German troops will occupy Slovakia and incorporate it as Germany's third protectorate. German troops have already entered some parts of Slovakia according to the Deschner Agreement, and Slovakia cannot resist. Germany seems to have suggested to Hungary that if Hungary cedes a narrow strip of territory west of the Labe River to Germany, it will receive a larger piece of Slovak territory as a reward. The correspondent believes that Hungary has firmly refused to agree. (Reuters, 14th)

(Berlin) Rumors that Germany will mobilize troops to the border of the Slovak State have recently been earnestly denied by responsible parties, who said that Germany has no intention of changing the current system in the Slovak State. (The Slovak State is currently placed under German protection.) (Havas News Agency, 14th)

### US House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Neutrality Act Amendment Abolishing Ban on Arms Exports

(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee recently continued its meeting today to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment. It immediately passed the amendment proposed by Chairman Bloom with twelve votes in favor and eight votes against. All twelve Democratic committee members voted in favor, while all eight Republican committee members voted against. According to Bloom, the House of Representatives can vote on this bill as soon as it is discussed on the 16th of this month. The points of the Bloom bill are as follows: (1) The current Neutrality Act prohibits lending money to belligerent countries, prohibits holding fundraisers for those countries, and prohibits warships of those countries from using US ports to refuel and resupply. All three of these amendments will be retained. (2) The current arms export supervision measures will also be implemented as usual. (3) The ban on arms exports will be abolished. (4) Various goods transported to belligerent countries should transfer ownership to foreign buyers before export. (5) Authorize the President to designate war zones and prohibit American citizens or ships from entering them. (Havas News Agency, 13th)

(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday passed the new Neutrality Act bill, despite the obstruction of isolationists in the Senate. Thus, Secretary of State Hull's proposal has achieved good results. Yesterday, the members of the House committees expressed their attitudes according to their party's positions, with a vote ratio of twelve to eight. The decision will abolish the existing embargo on arms. Once the President specifies the scope of the war zone, American merchant ships and citizens will not be allowed to enter the war zone. It is said that the bill also stipulates regulations for goods transported to belligerent countries. In the future, the ownership of all goods should be transferred to foreign buyers before the goods are loaded, so that the US government authorities will not bear the responsibility for protecting transportation. President Roosevelt announced the definition of "weapons, ammunition, and implements of war" on May 1 of this year, and the committee has now adopted this definition and has further prohibited American merchant ships from entering belligerent countries after being armed. The new bill will still prohibit American citizens from lending money and extending credit to belligerent countries, but the President may modify this situation in order to "protect the business and other interests of American citizens," so that the American people can still lend commercial loans and short-term loans to belligerent countries. The President should publicly report on such exceptions, with the publication period being once per quarter. In addition, it will strictly restrict belligerent countries from attracting money and absorbing funds in the United States. According to the bill, the existing Arms Management Department will continue to exist. The President will order restrictions on foreign submarines and armed merchant ships from using American seaports, but the provisions of the Neutrality Act will never be applied to other countries in the Americas. According to the Vice Chairman of the Committee (Democratic Congressman from New York), Mr. Bloom, the bill should be submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion within two weeks. (Associated Press News Agency, 14th)

### Japan Imports Large Quantities of Iron Sand

British Malaya Supplies 250,000 Tons Per Month

Singapore: Japan imports nearly 250,000 tons of iron sand from British Malaya every month. Exports to Japan in April totaled 235,259 tons, 75,351 tons in March, 30,902 tons in February, 43,698 tons in January, and 113,434 tons in April last year. The number of shipments to Japan in the first three months of each year is usually low because most of the iron sand supply comes from Kelantan and Trengganu, and during this period, loading on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula is often hindered by seasonal winds and weather. Of the iron sand shipped to Japan in April, 73,759 tons came from Sungei Lembing, 68,040 tons came from Kelantan, and 93,460 tons came from Trengganu. The mines producing this iron sand are all owned by the Japanese, and most of the workers are Japanese and Indians. Chinese workers stopped working after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War.

### Polish Economic Envoys Arrived in London Yesterday Negotiating Credit Loans for Expanding Military Preparations

(London) The Polish economic delegation, led by Colonel Kok, the government's financial advisor and director of the Bank of Poland, arrived here today to earnestly negotiate with the British government on obtaining export credit loans to purchase various military equipment. At the same time, the country's military delegation, led by Air Force Chief of Staff General Rayski, will also come here this weekend. Regarding this matter, responsible parties stated that after the British military delegation investigated the military needs in Poland, they submitted a report advocating that a huge sum of 60 million pounds be loaned to the country for expanding military preparations. However, the British Treasury Department believes that this amount is too large and intends to grant export credit loans in the same manner as Turkey (the credit loans granted by Britain to Turkey totaled 16 million pounds). The Polish government then proposed a compromise solution, that is, Britain would supply a large number of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns, and the ownership would still belong to Britain. If war breaks out in the future, these aircraft can still be piloted by British pilots, so as to form a joint air force in Eastern Europe. The Polish military delegation is coming to Britain to continue discussing this matter and to select suitable military equipment for the country's army. (Havas News Agency, 14th)

### Panic over Food and Fuel in Guangzhou: Guangzhou Cut Off from Neighboring Counties, Japanese Military Conducts Household Registration, More Residents Leaving the City

Hong Kong Dispatch: Since its fall, Guangzhou has become a dead city. Its connection with neighboring counties has been severed, hindering freight transport and disrupting the economy. This has forced the people within the city to live without any means of support. The Japanese military arbitrarily inspects and extracts resources, placing the citizens in a situation where both laughter and tears are inappropriate. This policy contradicts their proclaimed "prosperity policy." For instance, the recent farce of a "business resumption movement" jointly staged by the Japanese military and the puppet regime saw a puppet chamber of commerce president enticing closed shop owners to reopen, but few responded. According to a recent survey, the number of reopened shops in the entire city is no more than three hundred, and most of these are small food shops and second-hand goods stalls. The capital of each shop is mostly less than a thousand yuan, and some only have tens of yuan. Besides these, the only businesses open are Japanese commercial firms. Many of these firms are located on Yide Road in the city, some engaging in wholesale, others in retail. Wholesale mainly involves seafood, grains, and textiles, while retail mainly consists of cafes and daily necessities stores.

Guangzhou's grain supply usually relies on rice from counties such as Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and Zhongshan. In lean years, it depends on imported white rice from Annam and Siam. Since Guangzhou fell last October, the rice-producing areas of Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and Zhongshan have been ravaged by Japanese cavalry. Farmers have abandoned their fields, and grain seeds are exhausted. This year's early crops have left the fields barren. Therefore, since the beginning of summer, not a single dan (unit of weight) of local rice has been imported into Guangzhou. What is sold in the market is all foreign rice transported by the Japanese military. Demand exceeds supply, and rice prices have soared. Currently, one yuan can only buy four jin (unit of weight) and eight liang of foreign rice. For the survivors after the disaster, food has become a major problem, and the poor, weak, and elderly have no way to survive. As a result, people are starving to death on the streets. The coolie class all look malnourished, and the young and strong are moving to other places to seek food. Therefore, in the past eight months, 80% to 90% of households in the city have stopped cooking. Not only is grain as precious as pearls, but even firewood is as rare as cassia. In the past, Guangzhou's fuel completely relied on firewood transported from the east and west rivers, with one yuan buying 60 to 80 jin. Since the entire city was looted last year, the stored firewood has been exhausted. At the same time, the east and west rivers were blockaded, and firewood boats could not transport goods. As a result, the source of firewood was cut off. For several months, the fuel used by residents has been entirely the beams and pillars dismantled from houses and sold by bandits. However, this old timber also costs 40 jin per yuan, and sometimes there is no supply at all.

Vegetables and meat are also twice as expensive as before. Pork sells for one yuan and eight jiao per jin, and roasted meat sells for two yuan per jin, and they are often out of stock. This is because pigs are purchased by peddlers at the risk of their lives from suburban villages, and these villages do not necessarily have pigs for sale, as the Japanese military's goal is to plunder pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks wherever they go.

The Japanese military has been unable to maintain public order in Guangzhou, so they have adopted harsh measures, implementing so-called household registration checks, causing the residents who remain in the city to be unable to bear the abuse and leave the city in droves. The Japanese military's previous appeasement policy has now yielded contradictory results. The so-called household registration check method involves first listing the name, number, age, and occupation of each male and female resident on a wooden plaque and hanging it in front of the door for the puppet police to check at any time. If there is any suspicion during the check, they are immediately arrested. In areas where household registration checks are carried out, residents are not allowed to go out after 10 pm. If friends or relatives visit, they must report to the puppet police station before 6 pm every day, otherwise they will be regarded as harboring bandits. Residents must also be universally vaccinated. As soon as this regulation was issued, the residents had no peace. Many Japanese soldiers are stationed in Henan, Guangzhou, so the precautions are stricter than elsewhere. The Hongde and Haitong districts of Henan are now designated to start implementation.

### Current Situation of Joint Land and Water Transport in Chaozhou and Meizhou: Garrison Headquarters Manages Boats and Vehicles

Shantou Dispatch: Recently, Japanese warships have been gathering in the sea off Shantou. On the 7th, four Japanese warships, along with twenty armed fishing boats, patrolled between Huilai Shenquan and Aojiao to spy. However, there are ten miles of salt fields on the coast of Aojiao, making it difficult for the Japanese army to land. Therefore, the Japanese warships lingered for four hours, sent out planes for reconnaissance, and sailed east after nightfall. On the 8th, three more Japanese warships, twelve electric boats, and wooden rafts and bamboo rafts gathered on the sea off Houzhai, Nan'ao, and sent a plane to scout the north and south ports of Chenghai, but did not drop bombs. At this time, more than half of the residents of Shantou City have moved away. Martial law was implemented from the evening of the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, armed military police cooperated to stand guard and check pedestrians. There were no daytime or night markets in the city. Six thousand workers who dismantled the railway worked day and night, and the dismantled steel rails were transported to other places by wooden rafts. Therefore, outside the four suburbs of Shantou, transportation has changed. Once out of Shantou, it relies entirely on boats. The Shantou Garrison Headquarters has specially set up a "Chaozhou and Shantou Joint Land and Water Transport Office" to prevent boatmen from arbitrarily extorting refugees. All sailboats capable of carrying 50 dan are organized into teams and managed by the military. No agencies or groups are allowed to arbitrarily seal off ships. Officials and merchants employ them equally. All vehicles and laborers must also register and form teams at the joint transport office and be directed and dispatched by the office. Refugees, refugee children, and poor people with evacuation certificates can ride boats and vehicles to Chaozhou and Meizhou for free. The second batch of 180 refugee children from Hong Kong who passed through Shantou to Shaozhou the day before yesterday took a boat from Shantou to Chao'an, transferred to Songkou, and then walked to Shaoguan. Moreover, walking to Shaozhou is currently safer than boats and vehicles, because Japanese planes frequently come to Meizhou and Xingning to偵察 and drop bombs, specifically targeting boats and vehicles, opening fire and扫射 passengers. For example, at 9 am on the 5th, after a Japanese plane flew to Meixian to drop bombs, it opened fire on the traffic liner traveling between Songkou and Chao'an. The liner was sailing downstream from Songkou that day. After passing Sanheba, it was attacked by a Japanese plane. Two passengers were killed in the cabin, and four or five were injured. The ship quickly pulled alongside the shore to allow passengers to disembark and hide. After the Japanese plane left, it returned to traffic and rushed to Chao'an. According to people from Meixian who came to Shantou, seven bombs were dropped on Meixian city that day. Two bombs did not explode. The county high school inside the South Gate, the Li Family Ancestral Hall (Si'e Ancestral Hall), the Lingfeng Building outside the South Gate, and the Lan Yuanyu and Li Lisheng gold shops were all destroyed. Several people were killed or injured. The population of various cities in Chaozhou and Shantou is evacuated, and now they all rely on walking. According to traffic indicators, a station is set up every 30 li. Refugee children and women walk leisurely, walking two stations a day to reach a safe area.

### Ministry of Education Implements Health Education, Scouting, and Military Training, Health Education Has Been Conducted in Seventeen Provinces and Cities, Scouting Education Improves Three-Level Curriculum, School Military Training Closely Connected with Educational Administration

(Chongqing Dispatch) The Ministry of Education's implementation of health education, scouting education, and school military training is summarized below:

Health Education

Republic of China Year 18

The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health (now renamed the Department of Health) jointly announced regulations on health examinations for school students and other laws and regulations, and held the first national health education workshop in Shanghai to train teachers and administrative staff to promote the implementation of laws and regulations. After the Medical Education Committee was established in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Middle and Small School Health Education Design Committee was organized to succeed it and was attached to the Medical Education Committee. In the 24th year, the Ministry of Education ordered all provinces and cities to organize health education committees and designated school personnel to manage school health affairs. Before the War of Resistance, the provinces and cities that carried out health education included Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and the Weihaiwei Administrative Region.

Scouting Education

Scouting is originally

A method of supplementary education in schools, led and managed by the General Association of Chinese Scouts. In order to make education more closely related to life, the Ministry of Education, in addition to improving school education methods, has stipulated since the 23rd year that Scouting is a compulsory course for junior high schools and schools of equal level. The number of scout troops nationwide has greatly increased. In the autumn of the 25th year, a national scout review and jamboree was held, with excellent results. During this period of resistance and national reconstruction, the work of youth training is of great importance. In addition to urging junior high schools across the country to implement it earnestly, the Ministry of Education plans to organize a committee to conduct a detailed review of the original three-level curriculum to improve it to meet the needs of the times.

School Military Training

School student military

Affairs training began in the 18th year and is a compulsory subject for students in high schools and above. Initially, there was only peacetime training in school. Later, in order to allow students to gain more practical military life and economy, concentrated training was added from the 23rd year, with provinces and cities as units. The period for high schools is three months (vocational schools can be reduced to 40 days to two months), and the period for junior colleges and above is two months. The purpose of military training is to provide various training in spirit, life, physique, and skills to complete national and reserve sergeant education. All teaching methods and textbook content are presided over by the former Training Directorate and the current Political Department of the Military Commission. Instructors are also selected by the Political Department and appointed by the Ministry of Education. According to past situations, difficulties in equipment and personnel have been heard from time to time, and the ideal goals have not been achieved. The Ministry of Education is closely liaising with the Political Department to strive for the enrichment and rationality of teaching content, the improvement of instructor training and appointment, and the solution of time and equipment issues.

### Finance: Profit-Taking Bulls Emerge, Cash Reverses, Falling Below the 2,600 Yuan Mark, A Small Correction After Seven Consecutive Days of Gains

Yesterday, the Shanghai Red cash market started with a sluggish tone, then rose, and finally fell again, seemingly shifting with buying and selling forces. The morning opening was pressed down to 2,600 yuan because a certain gold firm continued to liquidate positions on behalf of speculators. Subsequently, although a certain gold firm continued to sell, a certain money exchange firm showed vigorous interest, once pushing the price up to 620 yuan. Later, because securities firms, acting on behalf of northern merchant bulls, tended to sell, and general floating bulls also followed suit to cash in profits, the market, although a certain gold firm (acting on behalf of speculators) seized the opportunity to re-enter, still felt supply exceeded demand. As a result, the market price broke below the 2,600 yuan mark, once falling to a low of 2,520 yuan. Finally, a certain gold firm still had strong bullish sentiment and entered on dips, stabilizing the market. The market closed at 2,585 yuan, down 35 yuan from the previous day. Trading was still active, reaching around 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold also fell by 3 yuan, Customs gold remained stable, and Chinese and English pure gold both declined slightly.

Shanghai Red Drops 35 Yuan

From the morning, for each bar (ten taels), the opening saw a certain gold firm's speculator still keen to exit positions, initially bidding 2,615 yuan, but buyers were reluctant, so the price was gradually lowered. The market opened 20 yuan lower at 9:30 AM. A certain gold firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange firm at 2,600 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange firm's buying was quite good, so the gold firm raised prices to meet demand, and the market moved upward, once rising to 620 yuan. Later, retail investors took advantage of the high prices to sell, returning to a downward trend. Money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves, lowering the price to 605 yuan. At that time, northern merchants suddenly entrusted securities firms to tend to exit positions, and the market price became more unsustainable, breaking below the 600 yuan mark. However, a certain gold firm seized the opportunity to raise prices and re-enter, and retail investors also showed some interest. Several hundred taels were traded in between, falling sharply to 575 yuan. Later, northern merchant selling interest weakened, and a certain gold firm's speculator continued to absorb, returning the price to 595 yuan.

At 3:40 PM, the jewelry firm sold 50 taels to the money exchange firm, and the price returned to 585 yuan. After that, a certain layman suddenly entrusted a certain silver firm to suddenly absorb, so sellers were hesitant. Although the price was raised to beyond the 590 yuan mark, selling interest was still weak, extending to 4 PM without any transactions. So, the closing was still 2,585 yuan, resulting in a drop of 35 yuan compared to the day before, which was a correction of 526 yuan after seven consecutive days of gains.

In fact, large institutional bulls were too crowded, and released slightly.

### Grains: Flour Prices Increase, Reaching 4 Yuan and 8 Jiao, Wheat Market Tightens

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market situation: prices increased step by step. Since the price increase started by Japan on Thursday of last week, although there has been no violent surge, the opening price has risen and seems to have no end. The factory believes that the rising trend is insufficient and refuses to sell in large quantities. The small amount of recovered goods floating on the market has also been absorbed by hoarding households, so the market has become increasingly strong. It was heard that high-brand foreign flour still required a bidding price of 5 yuan, while ordinary brands sold for 4 yuan 7 jiao and a half, also up 5 fen from before. The No. 2 flour factory's order uniformly rose to 4 yuan 8 jiao for remittances, but transactions were not smooth, because customers' hoarding appetite was good, but the factory's supply was still limited as a careful measure. Today, 12,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tanggu, Tianjin, and 2,500 bags are being shipped to Shantou.

Wheat: Yesterday, the source of new wheat had slightly arrived, all goods from the Shanghai-Nanjing road area. It was heard that Changshu new wheat also had a few scattered arrivals at the port. This year, because the weather was drier, the wheat grains were dry. At this time, the price of foreign wheat was expensive, and people's hearts were bullish, which aroused the attention of general hoarding households. It was heard that there were many secretly buying, resulting in a tight market, but the needs of Chinese factories were still silent, and Japanese merchants' intake was also slack, so formal transactions remained steady. Yesterday, the street office bought 65 bags of Kunshan new wheat, and the price was still 6 yuan and 8 fen.

Hoarding Households Active, Rice Prices Continue to Rise by Half a Yuan

Dugeng Rice: Yesterday, each merchant source arrived from the riverbank, a total of 3,000+ bags of Nan Gang 1-2, wheeled Juzi, Tongkun and other merchants. Due to clear and dry weather, the appetites of the local street and hoarding households continued to be good, and merchants continued to do well, so the market became lively again. Each good opened higher prices, such as Changgao Geng which was opening at 19 yuan and 4 jiao, a rise of 4-5 jiao compared to the previous market. Only Su Tong Geng, with a weaker body, was more than one yuan short, but it also rose 4 jiao plus change. Bo Dao, which had previously opened at 18 yuan, opened at 18 yuan and a half yesterday.

Ke Xian Rice: Since the Wuhu report increased, the daily arrival head has gradually decreased, and after the daily decrease from 5-6 thousand bags to 2-3 thousand bags, the first layer source has decreased. Therefore, the cargo side's thoughts were more upward. Yesterday, the mainland merchants' intake was light, and the shop consumption of the local street was also slack, but hoarding households instead made up for it, so transactions still reached 6,500-6,600 bags, and the price rose by 4-5-6 jiao. Nanjing Xian opened at 16 yuan and a half, and Wuhu Gao Xian also required 16 yuan and 2-3 jiao. As for Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian, it also followed the Geng market and increased by 3-4 jiao.

Foreign Rice: There are still 8-9 thousand bags in stock, but they are all in the hands of industry hoarders. Because rice prices have soared in recent days, they have all held firm and have not released. After the Saigon opening at 20 yuan and 4 jiao the day before, there were immediately inquiries at 20 yuan and 6-7 jiao that night. Yesterday, the cargo owner actually asked for a price of 21 yuan per jiao, so it was difficult to complete the transaction.

Glutinous Rice: The current sales of rice cakes and ziba are slightly mobile, but other things are not very smooth. Yesterday, the market Gao Bai and other were opened at 21 yuan and 2 jiao to 20 yuan, and the market was similar, better three or four jiao.

### Coal: Indian Coal Continues to Rise

Since the changes in the exchange market, the price of Robbie tickets for Indian bituminous coal has risen sharply, and the cost is relevant, and the price has been called up 4 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn: Gold Price Drops, Cotton Yarn Buyers Hesitant, 20-count Double Horse Down 10 Yuan

The cotton yarn market, which had been soaring for days, has now reversed and fallen. Market rumors are gradually subsiding. Foreign exchange rates remain stable, hovering around 6.5. All unsubstantiated claims have collapsed on their own. Gold prices have also softened. At the same time, actual sales remain sluggish. The market has announced a decline. However, a certain yarn firm, Feng, has a large amount of cotton yarn of various brands on hand, usually stockpiling three to four thousand bales as a base, selling on the market when prices rise and buying when prices fall. Since the reduction in remittances, general retail investors have seen prices fluctuate by more than seventy yuan. Some are content and have already sold their holdings, but the majority believe that the big gains will be followed by minor pullbacks, and that there is still potential for further price increases.

The opening price of spot yarn this morning was due to the large amount held by bulls. Everyone has a few bales of goods in hand. In addition, bankers have been very active in the spot market recently. Thus, morale is good. Everyone believes that the goods they have bought are valuable and they can rest easy. Consequently, it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. Asking prices remain unchanged. The price of 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods is 498 yuan, and warehouse receipts are 487 yuan. After a while, the situation was sluggish and sellers were slightly more prevalent, saying that foreign exchange was firm and gold prices were falling. Buyers were hesitant and prices gradually declined. In an instant, the spot price of Double Horse fell by 12 yuan, to 486 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 481 yuan. Then, the bullish side slightly bought in a few bales and prices rose again. At the close, the spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 489 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 484 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that Japanese yarn had suddenly fallen by 5 yuan. The price of Double Horse warehouse receipts was 479 yuan, and the spot price was also 486 or 487 yuan. Then, Feng Yarn Firm bought in a few more bales, and prices improved immediately, with momentum tightening.

The market prices fell by 10 yuan for 20-count Double Horse, 8 yuan for Five Blessings, 12 yuan for Shepherd, 27 yuan for Special Golden City, and 11 yuan for Double Globe. Today, 645 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 690 bales to Shantou, and 100 bales to Haiphong. The quantity purchased by each firm is listed on the left.

Same Firm 1, 425 Hong Kong 415

Mainland 75 Shantou 95

Hunan 20 Total 2,030

Japanese yarn continues to fall in reaction. According to the market, after gradually soaring, actual demand remains unchanged. Reports that the Japanese army has seized concessions in Shanghai have caused bulls to feel uneasy, and the price has fallen sharply by 10 yuan, breaking the 400 yuan mark. Yueqin yarn for this month is priced at 398 yuan.

Although there are no transactions in cotton, the industry is unusually prosperous.

More than 3,000 bales of American and Indian cotton were traded.

Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York market hesitated yesterday because the US Department of Agriculture's proposed agricultural loan bill failed to pass. However, excessive rainfall in production areas has had a severe impact on cotton production, and there is no end in sight for government loans for cotton. Cloth transactions are improving day by day, and spot goods on the market are becoming tighter. As a result, cotton prices have risen, increasing by another 7 or 8 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, has risen by 1 rupee, and Egyptian cotton has risen by 3 or 5 points.

Although foreign firms in Shanghai have not set a date for trading, trading among domestic firms is unusually prosperous. Yesterday, domestic firms traded more than 3,000 bales of Indian and American cotton with each other. Recently, the arrival of goods at Japanese factories has been very congested. Previously, due to unsettled foreign exchange, payments could not be made, resulting in delays for many days. Now, after various efforts, some foreign exchange has been settled on the black market, and the goods that arrived earlier are currently being cleared through customs. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese factories' purchase of goods from flower firms will be temporarily reduced.

Cotton business is very sparse, but transactions among domestic firms are unusually lively. Most of these spot goods are sold to Japanese factories, and are raw materials for spinning 33-count and above. The fire machine flower bodies are of superior quality and the selling prices are very high. However, due to foreign exchange issues, the factories have not taken action and transactions are stagnant. Regarding sources from northern Jiangsu, 497 bales of Xiasha flower have arrived, as well as 1,958 bales of cotton from Ningbo and 170 bales from Beisha. The current situation of spot cotton is as follows:

### Oil Cakes: Rumors of Dalian Opening Up, Soybean Oil Price Falls, Crude Oil Remains Soft

Soybean Oil: Previously, due to limited supply, morale was tense, providing manipulators with an excellent opportunity. As a result, market prices were on track to pursue the highest record on April 24. Until yesterday morning, the prices of various oils continued to rise sharply by one yuan. Specifically, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were priced at 33 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai Qiqi oil were priced at 34 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil were priced at 33.5 yuan, and 500 cans of Tianjin canned oil were priced at 44.3 yuan. However, Dalian oil needed to rise by 1.8 yuan to 46.8 yuan, with 20 barrels traded. Also, 100 barrels of Kobe oil were priced at 46.3 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that the Dalian Oil Mountain pseudo-regime was responsible for transportation and that it would implement an opening up policy. Therefore, floating stockpiles were quickly released and market sentiment turned downstream. Kobe oil was the first to shed its price, plummeting from 45.5 yuan to 44.5 yuan, trading over 100 barrels, which was down 0.4 yuan from the previous day's highest price. As a result, other oils failed to continue trading at higher prices.

Crude Oil: The market opened unstably in the morning because Shandong firms were eagerly dumping Jiaozhou oil on the road. Therefore, market sentiment remained soft. As a result, 500 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded on the spot at 34 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous market. More than 1,000 pieces of road goods were sold, priced at 33.5 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, under the poor atmosphere of soybean oil, prices fell 0.5 yuan to 33 yuan. Today, 450 pieces and 4,590 cans of crude oil were exported to Hong Kong.

Soybean Cake Still Soaring

### Piece Goods: Ningbo Firm Sales Show Development, Lun Chang Goods Market Attacked Suddenly, Dong Piece Tianjin Firm Recalling

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, the prices of white cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth in the market turned peaceful. However, because the stock of fine twill cloth in the market is short, and dyeing is still widely used, the price of 78-yard grey twill has reached 25 yuan per piece for top-grade and about 23.75 yuan for second-grade, an increase of 0.25 yuan per large piece.

Although costs are high, market prices fluctuate. However, the Zhejiang East Wenzhou and Youtou firms have been actively buying dark-colored line, straight line, and serge cloth for days, and have traded 300 boxes of Lun Chang Hong Zhang Li Xin factory products. Because Lun Chang goods are no longer produced by the factory, the current sales have tightened the inventory of domestic firms. Ordinary Kowloon Mountain serge has risen from 15.25 yuan to 15.90 yuan per piece. The new price of the first-class straight silk satin is 17.25 yuan, which is also more than one yuan higher than before.

At the close of the night market, it turned firm again. The price of Dragon head for this month is 14.70 yuan, and the price for next month is 14.85 yuan. Because dyeing sales in this street are still good, the price of fine twill is relatively stable.

Exports

Due to the cost of new imports, the average price of wool has suddenly risen by about 1.50 yuan to 2 yuan per yard. Although it is the height of summer, the arrival of goods is scarce. However, waterproof raincoat fabric is in season and is mostly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

### Silk Tea: European Sales Not Weak, Tea Prices Rise Frequently

Yesterday, the green tea market was still lively. Although various tea factories have received many new goods recently, British and French firms are taking advantage of favorable exchange rates and strong demand from Morocco, continuing to push prices up aggressively. Market momentum remains strong. In total, 870 boxes of green tea were purchased by Yihe, Baochang, Tianyu, Dude, and other foreign firms. The top quality pearl eyebrows were raised to a high of 280 yuan, the highest price in recent years.

Silk and Tea Exports (13th): 139 pieces of Huzhou silk to Europe, 209 tons of tea to Spain. Today, 13 pieces of tea were shipped to Yantai and 42 boxes to Hong Kong.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Active Demand for Sun-Dried Longan

Sun-dried longan has become more active recently, and the market has turned from weak to firm. Yesterday, the companies offered 60-70 boxes, and the price rose by 2-3 yuan from the lower price. However, the demand for Shikma goods is weaker. Although there is talk of price, there is no deal yet. There is still potential for improvement. Today, 1,200 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Hardware: White Iron Sheet Sales Recover

The white iron sheet market feels lively again. It is reported that the total amount offered in the city has reached more than 30 tons. The market price has risen by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan (calculated by sheet) and 2 to 3 yuan (calculated by dan). For example, British goods of No. 24, 3.7 feet, are sold at 34 yuan per dan, No. 26 at 35 yuan, and No. 28 at 36.5 yuan. East goods (Samsung brand) of No. 30, 3.6 feet, are sold at 2.9 yuan per sheet, and 3.7 feet at 3.5 yuan per sheet.

### Japan Will Not Take Any Action Against the Public Concession: Spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy Claims, But Says Reasonable Demands Will Be Made

The China Press reports that when Japanese officials hosted journalists yesterday (the 13th), they were asked about Lord Altrincham's statement in the Upper House that July 7th was a dangerous date for the Public Concession. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy declared that, as previously stated, if any major incidents occurred "across the Suzhou Creek," Japanese authorities would not guarantee that their troops would not enter the Public Concession. They had not heard the rumors that Japanese troops would occupy the Public Concession on July 7th. He personally did not believe this to be true. He did not criticize Mr. Hersch's speech, which mentioned the United States' firm stance against any Japanese encroachment on the Public Concession. He continued by saying that the authorities in this country cannot deny that the management mechanism of the Public Concession is outdated and unsuitable for the current situation. So far, we have demanded that the current policies of the Public Concession's management mechanism be corrected. Naturally, such reasonable demands will cause some discord if they are not agreed to by people of third countries. I cannot say what will happen until these demands are rejected or accepted. Japan will continue to demand the revision of the current policies of the Public Concession's management mechanism.

### Formal Resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo Route Still Awaits

Detention of De Ping Understood

Regarding the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, since the Ningbo authorities ordered a blockade on March 5th, all previously approved ships have been uniformly prohibited from entering and leaving, and transportation has been cut off for more than a month. After repeated requests from all parties, the authorities, in order to facilitate the transportation of goods, have expediently allowed specially permitted ships to import necessities, but absolutely prohibit passengers. Therefore, the resumption of shipping is still

Temporary in nature, not a formal resumption. At the beginning of this month, it was widely rumored in Ningbo that the Shanghai-Ningbo route would be formally resumed starting on the 15th. However, as of 6:00 PM yesterday, shipping circles in this city had not received the aforementioned order. Therefore, the date of formal resumption still awaits. In addition, the De Ping ship of the Italian Chinese Shipping Company, was in Ningbo on the 3rd of this month, and was attacked by

Japanese Aircraft

So it set sail to Shanghai without being inspected by the military police authorities. The Ningbo authorities considered it a violation of orders, so the ship was detained when it sailed to Ningbo again on the morning of the 9th. After the company explained to the Ningbo Defense Headquarters,

Understanding Has Been Obtained

Permission was granted to reduce the detention by five days, which has now expired. The ship has telegraphed that it is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo at 8:00 AM this morning and will arrive in port tonight. If there is not enough time, it may be delayed until tomorrow morning to enter the port. Furthermore, the Moufu ship of the German Reihher & Co. set sail on the morning of the 13th. The company received a telegram yesterday stating that it had entered and arrived in Ningbo at 8:15 AM yesterday morning.

### Ningbo Disaster Relief Donations Exceed 40,000

15,000 Yuan Has Been Remitted, Goal of 50,000 Yuan Pre-Determined

The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, in view of the deep disaster in its hometown, urgently raised donations for Ningbo disaster relief, and entrusted the bank to collect funds. As of the day before yesterday, the total reported amount has exceeded 40,000 yuan. The target of 50,000 yuan is almost reached. Therefore, the fundraising results can be described as excellent. The association has remitted 15,000 yuan to Ningbo in succession to handle emergency relief, and will continue to remit funds for assistance according to the needs of the disaster.

### Japanese Warships Bomb Wenzhou

Indiscriminate Firing A Common Sight

According to passengers who arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday, a Japanese warship arrived off Huanghua Ocean in Wenzhou on the morning of the 12th. At about 9:00 AM, it fired seven or eight shots at the shore and then left. All were indiscriminate shots, with no major damage. Local residents have become accustomed to the Japanese warships firing and are quite calm. The Shanghai-Wenzhou flights are still operating as usual. The Hai Fu and Bao Li ships sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 13th. The company has received a telegram stating that they arrived safely at noon yesterday. The Feikang ship sailed yesterday. However, the Wenzhou port is quite serious about inspecting incoming and outgoing passengers and goods.

### Tianjin Concessions Blockaded, Exported Cargo Returned, British Shipping Company in Shanghai Received Telegram from Tianjin Yesterday, Waterway Also Blocked, Ships May Have Difficulty Berthing

The British and French concessions in Tianjin were effectively blockaded by the Japanese army starting yesterday morning, cutting off traffic. It is reported that the waterway has also been blocked, and the situation is very serious. All circles in this city are extremely concerned, and the shipping industry is even more concerned. This morning, two British shipping companies in this city have received telegrams from the Tianjin branch regarding the situation after the blockade. According to reports, the waterway has also been blocked, and ships coming to Tianjin may not be able to dock at the wharves in the concession. Please do not load cargo, etc. After receiving the telegrams, the companies have complied. Judging from the telegrams from the Tianjin offices of the above-mentioned companies, it is evident that the extent of the serious situation in the Tianjin concessions. The TaiGuo Company has no ships going to Tianjin in the past two days. The Shengjing ship will not sail until the 17th. How things will change by then cannot be predicted at this time. Jardine Matheson has the Ding Sheng ship scheduled to depart at 1:00 PM this afternoon, passing through Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai to Tianjin. The goods that were originally loaded for Tianjin have all been returned to customs. However, the goods for Tanggu and more than 10,000 bags of flour will be transported as usual. The company also originally scheduled the Yong Sheng Xin ship to sail to Tianjin on the 17th.

### Lun Chang Labor and Management Are Quietly Awaiting a Reasonable Resolution, The Factory Does Not Recognize the Puppet Organization, Absolutely No Entrusted Mediation

The labor-management dispute at the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Pudong has been maliciously instigated by the puppet regime, attempting to incite an anti-British movement and forcibly prevent workers from returning to work, resulting in a failure to resolve the situation. After the factory's British employee, Ding Geller, was stabbed and killed by the Japanese army, the labor strike has further evolved into a diplomatic issue, causing the labor strike itself to become deadlocked. All honest workers, under the threat and coercion of the "puppet strike committee" and the so-called "workers' union," have lost their freedom and are eager to return to the factory as soon as possible. It is now understood that the factory is quietly awaiting negotiations by the British government to seek a reasonable resolution. However, the puppet regime suddenly spread rumors a few days ago, claiming that the factory manager, Sinclair, had requested mediation from the Japanese side and had been introduced by the Japanese side to meet with the "Municipal Government Authorities." According to inquiries from the labor side, the news is completely inaccurate. The factory has never recognized the puppet organization, so there has been absolutely no entrusted mediation. The puppet regime's dissemination of this rumor is clearly intended to offer itself. (Da Guang She)

Japanese Newspapers: Fabricated Story

The Continental News reports that the New Shenbao, controlled by the Japanese, published a prominent message yesterday (the 13th), stating that personnel from the Pudong Lun Chang Textile Factory, led by Director Sinclair, visited the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters on June 9th to request Japanese assistance in resolving the deadlock in the Lun Chang factory strike. It was agreed to report to the "Shanghai Municipal Government" for arbitration. The reporter asked the Lun Chang Company personnel, and they remained silent, saying that they could not say a word about this situation a month ago. According to reliable sources, the strikers and the company had resolved the strike on June 2nd. However, according to reliable sources, on June 5th, when the workers intended to enter the factory, they were blocked by the henchmen of the puppet regime. The "New Shenbao" message also stated that, at the request of the Lun Chang personnel, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps visited Zhou, the "Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs of the Municipal Government," with Sinclair and others on the morning of June 11th. Zhou promised to make every effort to peacefully resolve the strike. Pseudo-officials have "changed their attitude" in view of the Lun Chang Company's decision and have attached great importance to their contact with the "Shanghai Municipal Government."

Ding Geller Case Not Yet Resolved

The China Press reports that a Japanese spokesperson claimed yesterday (at a reception for journalists on the 13th) that the Japanese authorities had not yet sent a reply regarding the British protest after Ding Geller's death. After receiving the protest, the Japanese Consul-General Miura held talks with the British Consul-General Philip to discuss the basic relationship between Britain and Japan and the method of "eliminating disputes."

### Bloodshed Occurred on Route Doumer Yesterday Morning, Li Tianzhu and His Wife Were Shot by Thugs, Wife Died on the Spot, Li Himself is in Critical Condition

Large-Scale Search in the French Park

Zhou Wenyan, a 32-year-old Ningbo native and second landlord of No. 3, Dasheng Lane, No. 54 Route Doumer, is in the cigarette and paper business. In mid-June, there was a room for rent downstairs in the main hall. At that time, a Sichuanese named Li Tianzhu (28 years old this year) and his wife, Xu Yuanzhen (also known as Huiyu, 24 years old this year, from Jiaxing), went to rent the house. The monthly rent was set at 44 yuan, and it was agreed that the upstairs and downstairs houses would be separated. The second landlord and the upstairs tenants would enter and exit from the back alley, and the Li couple would live in the main hall and enter and exit from the

Front Door

Li and his wife moved in on the 17th of last month, hiring a maid to take care of chores. According to Li, he opened a Huihe Candy Company with double-fronted stores numbered 267 and 269 next to the Bial Road Ramon Grand Theatre, so it was common for him to leave early and return late. At 8:15 AM yesterday morning,

The Li Couple Just Gotten Up

The maid went to the small vegetable market to buy vegetables and returned, washing them in the courtyard, while Li was preparing to get dressed and go out, when suddenly two thugs pushed open the front door and entered. Without asking any questions, they immediately drew their guns and opened fire on Li Tianzhu and Li Xu Yuanzhen. Li's face and chest were each hit by one bullet, and Li Xu Yuanzhen's right breast and lower abdomen were each hit by one bullet. Both of them

Fell to the Ground at the Same Time

Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers turned around and left quickly. At that time, Li's maid was washing vegetables in the courtyard. The sudden sound of gunfire frightened her and she dared not look up, not seeing the faces or clothing of the murderers clearly. The upstairs tenants and the second landlord also did not pay attention. After the murderers left, the maid recovered from her shock and saw that the master and mistress were lying on the floor, with fresh blood flowing from their wounds.

Gushing Out

She ran outside the lane to report to the police post, who forwarded the report to the French Police Department. They immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and found that Li's wife, Xu Yuanzhen, had died of her injuries. Li was on his last breath, and an ambulance was immediately called to rush Li to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are very serious and his life may be in danger. At the same time, Xu Yuanzhen's body was sent to the autopsy room attached to the Labor Bureau Hospital on Rue Talast, awaiting today's report to the Special Second Court

To Send Personnel for Inspection

The reason for the Li couple's murder is being investigated by the police. The Police Department has instructed all detectives on duty to strictly search for the fleeing murderers and bring them to justice. At the same time, the French Police Department also ordered a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, about 40 people, to rush to the vicinity of the incident at 8:50 AM to conduct a thorough search of the French Park. First, the park gates on Avenue Lafayette and Avenue Hua Long and the side gate on Avenue Mallia were

Closed to Prohibit Visitors

From Entering and Exiting, Then the Detectives Began to Inspect the Tourists in the Park, Creating a Tense Atmosphere. It Took 25 Minutes to Finish, But the Results Were Unsuccessful. The Detectives Then Retreated and the Park Gates Were Reopened.

### British Ambassador's Safety: Continued Strict Protection; Ambassador Conforms to Popular Request and Wears a Steel Wire Vest; Rumored Bulletproof Car Being Prepared

The "North-China Daily News" reports that the precautions taken by the Public Concession Police and the British military authorities to protect the life of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, showed no signs of relaxation yesterday (the 13th). Chinese and Western police officers in the ambassador's uniform at the embassy at 27 Bund and the residence at 50 Tunsin Road have been replaced by detectives. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has now followed advice and wears a

Steel Wire Vest

when travelling on the streets of Shanghai.

However, he seems quite uncomfortable wearing this protective clothing. The ambassador's vest can withstand high-velocity Mauser bullets. The Western detectives protecting him on the left and right wear various lighter vests. Yesterday, a bulletproof car for the ambassador's use was also opened, and it is currently being manufactured in this city. However, this statement could not be confirmed. It is believed that when this car is in use, the accompanying

Police Officers

will be greatly reduced. However, the number of military police stationed at the embassy and its residence will remain unchanged. No official news was obtained yesterday. It is rumored that the ambassador's life is not under direct threat, nor have there been any intimidation incidents. However, the authorities have received information that someone is planning to plot against the ambassador's life. Reporters inquired among police circles yesterday, and they only confirmed that precautions had been taken, without saying anything else. Furthermore, the "Continental Times" reports that yesterday (the 13th), well-informed sources claimed that the

Special Precautions

taken since Saturday afternoon to protect the life of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, will continue for several weeks or even longer without interruption. News regarding threats or even conspiracies against the British Ambassador remained strictly secret yesterday, and no details could be ascertained. However, well-informed sources claimed that the increasing violence between the Japanese army and navy authorities in China has some connection with the precautions taken to ensure the ambassador's safety. Last night, reliable sources revealed that heavy

Gunfire

had been heard in the vicinity of the British Ambassador's residence on Tunsin Road yesterday morning. However, the distance was very far. Since this incident occurred within the Japanese-controlled area, the Public Concession Police did not conduct an investigation. It is rumored that the incident was caused by bandits attempting to rob a Chinese merchant's factory, and exchanging fire with the "Great Way" police.

Songjiang Ferry: Temporarily Terminating at Yexie

The ferry service from the Concession to Minhang and Yexie, which extends to Songjiang and stops at Xintai and Tu'lermiao along the way to pick up passengers, according to sources in the inland river shipping industry, on the 12th, the ferry departing from Shanghai was blocked near Xintai and forced to return. Because the situation there is chaotic, and fighting has been taking place in recent days, the ferry service to Xintai, Tu'lermiao, and Songjiang now terminates at Yexie. Inspections of passengers are still strict.

### The Puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" Attempts to Utilize White Russians, Threatening All White Russian Groups to Register, but They Would Rather Dissolve Their Organizations

The "Continental Times" reports that the White Russian Emigrant Committee, backed by the Japanese, published a formal notice in Russian newspapers in this city on the 4th of this month, stating that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" required all White Russian groups in the city to register with the committee by June 15th, in order to centrally control the "political intentions" of the White Russian groups. Several long-established White Russian organizations are therefore seriously considering ceasing their activities. Many members of the various groups believe that it would be better to dissolve than to register, because this move has

Political Purposes.

The Public Concession and French Concession

authorities have repeatedly warned White Russian emigrant groups that they must not engage in activities within the two concessions, and that violators will be deported. Although White Russian groups are not without fear of retaliation by the White Russian Emigrant Committee if they do not register, some groups believe that they would rather cease their activities. The committee's notice also stated that the committee would not provide assistance or protection to groups that ignored this registration requirement, and would not

Issue Passports

and other documents. According to many White Russians in Shanghai, this registration order is actually a means for the "Shanghai Municipal Government" to politically control the White Russians in Shanghai through the White Russian Emigrant Committee. Furthermore, they fear that after registration, detailed regulations will be imposed on the registered groups, eventually leading them to engage in certain political activities, which would be interfered with by the authorities of the two concessions, and endanger their own status. The vast majority of the 15,000 White Russians in Shanghai do not engage in politics, and only hope for a stable life. Most of them have already registered with the "Shanghai Municipal Government", which is a fact, but because they have no consular protection, they have no other choice.

### Various Organizations Hope That All Industries Will Voluntarily Curb Prices; Some Goods Unrelated to Foreign Exchange Take Advantage of the Situation to Raise Prices; Concession Authorities Take It Very Seriously and Are Monitoring the Situation; Rice Prices Are Clearly Being Manipulated and Are Soaring Unabated

The various public organizations in Shanghai believe that the continuous price increases in various industries and the endless rise in the prices of all goods are a matter of grave concern. Furthermore, some commodities that are not related to foreign exchange are taking the opportunity to raise their prices, only seeking their own profits and disregarding the livelihood of the public. This kind of behavior is deliberately disrupting the market and making the social situation even more severe. If it is not quickly curbed, then merchants in various industries will follow suit. The impact will be that ordinary people will be unable to live. Therefore, in addition to requesting the authorities to take effective measures, it is also hoped that the leaders of various industries and merchants can uphold their conscience, consider the overall situation, and refrain from arbitrarily increasing prices unless absolutely necessary, so that social order can be stabilized. Then all industries will benefit from it. The price of rice, since the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee automatically disbanded, the 15-yuan limit price in the Shanghai rice market has been invisibly canceled. Speculators are manipulating rice prices, using the pretext of the tightening of the black market foreign exchange and the time when the new crop is not yet available, resulting in soaring rice prices without end. Yesterday, the market price of top-grade white rice actually rose to more than 19 yuan. Medium-quality rice also rose accordingly. After inquiring from relevant parties, it was learned that the source of supply from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has not been cut off, and there are still more than 560,000 bags of rice in Shanghai. The tightening of black market foreign exchange has nothing to do with domestic rice, so the soaring rice prices breaking the 19-yuan mark is clearly the manipulation of speculators. This matter is of great importance to the food supply of the entire city, and all sectors hope that the Concession authorities will decisively deal with it.

Various Industries

Raise Prices

Since the sharp rise in foreign exchange, the prices of various goods such as gasoline,

hardware, Western medicine, coal, taxis, leather, etc. have all been notified to increase. Rickshaw merchants will also hold a meeting to re-submit a request for rent increase. Yesterday, industries such as enamel, coal balls, knitwear, paint, etc., and factories such as the China National Power Arts and Crafts Factory, Qingchang Screw Factory, and Huozhong Leather Factory, etc., announced the implementation of price increases.

Serious Threat to

the Lives of Ordinary People in Shanghai

Since the war, due to traffic obstruction and time-consuming transportation, the prices of all daily necessities and goods have been repeatedly increased. Compared with before the war, some have even increased by more than one time, and the general increase is also about 30-40%. The burden of rent, water, electricity, and other goods is even heavier. The lives of ordinary people were already difficult to cope with. Unexpectedly, recently, since the change in foreign exchange, various industries have raised prices due to cost reasons, causing the general salary class and ordinary coolies to be unable to maintain their lives, and their lives have been seriously threatened, and everyone is frowning.

Concession Authorities

Emphasize Development

The Public Concession Public Works Department believes that the high prices affect the livelihood of ordinary people, and some have suggested that the board of directors discuss ways to curb them. However, after considering the results, it is believed that this phenomenon is inevitable after the war at a time when the level of living is unstable. Under the principle of maintaining public order, the Concession authorities should emphasize its development. However, in order to be concerned about the living conditions of ordinary people, they are now collecting relevant materials and preparing reports for reference. When necessary, appropriate measures may be taken.

Postal Employees

Request Allowances

Since the war, Shanghai postal employees have been paid according to the deduction of salaries. The employees have endured hardships without complaint because of the extraordinary times. Recently, due to the high prices in Shanghai, the cost of living index in May rose to 164.87 (based on 1936), the highest record since the war. Those who rely on salaries for a living are all overwhelmed. For this reason, postal employees have requested the authorities to increase allowances, and have cited the Central Bank's increase of allowances as an example, and unanimously requested it. The labor union is now carrying out this matter, and it is heard that the authorities sympathize with it and are willing to make appropriate solutions, and it is expected that there will be satisfactory results.

Passenger Matters on Shanghai-Ningbo Cargo Ships

Have Not Yet Been Approved

All Ships Comply with the Ban

Cargo is Transported as Usual

After the Ningbo Defense Command approved the resumption of navigation of foreign ships to Ningbo in order to clear the Ningbo cargo transport, the Shanghai-Ningbo foreign ships now operating are the British Taikoo Company's "New Beijing" ship, the Italian Chinese-Italian Company's "De Ping" ship, and the German Rehe & Company's "Moufu" ship. However, they are only allowed to load cargo, and absolutely prohibited from carrying passengers. The "New Life News" reporter inquired from the shipping industry yesterday that regarding the issue of passengers on Shanghai-Ningbo ships, the Shanghai industries had jointly submitted a request to the Zhejiang military authorities, requesting accommodation to allow passengers to be attached to cargo ships in order to facilitate the collection of accounts by various industries during the Dragon Boat Festival. As of yesterday, no reply had been received. Therefore, the ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line will temporarily prohibit passengers in order to comply with government orders. However, navigation is still carried out as usual, so there is no so-called formal resumption of navigation.

Chen Jintao's

Funeral Was Desolate

Very Few Friends Mourned

Chen Jintao, the "Finance Minister of the Reformed Government" and "President of the Huaxing Bank," died of heart disease on the 12th. The details were first recorded in this newspaper on the 13th. It is now learned that Chen's body was collected at 3 p.m. yesterday at 18 Dongfang Village, Baole'an Road. Very few relatives and friends of Chen visited to mourn, so the scene was desolate. As for the vacancy of "President of Huaxing," it is rumored that there are many who are vying for it in Nanjing, but no decision has been made yet.

### Japan Refuses to Open the Yangtze River; Japanese Ships Sail Exclusively Between Shanghai and Hankou; Advertisements Are Publicly Posted to Solicit Customers; It Is Difficult for British Ships to Resume Navigation in Reality

Japan is attempting to monopolize China's shipping industry, blockading coastal ports, hindering the sailing of ships of third countries, and refusing to open the Yangtze River. Dalian, Nisshin, and other companies sail exclusively, and advertisements are posted to solicit customers. It is difficult for British ships to resume navigation in reality. The details are recorded as follows:

Japan Refuses to

Open the Yangtze River

The Shanghai-Hankou shipping route from Shanghai to Hankou passes through Nantong, Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu Datong, Anqing, Huayang, Jiujiang, Wuxue, Qichun, Huangshigang, Huangzhou, and other places. Before the war, the ships operating were British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the private Sanbei, Ningshao, and Japanese Nisshin. Since the fall of Hankou, Chinese ships have been forced to completely suspend navigation. Foreign ships, because the Japanese used military relations as an excuse, refused to sail the Yangtze River. Although the British side made representations, requesting that the Yangtze River be opened quickly, they were ultimately rejected by the Japanese side. At the end of last month, Jardine Matheson's "Ruihe" ship and Taikoo's "Wuxue" ship sailed from Shanghai to Hankou, carrying the British Navy's troop movements and cannot be considered as the resumption of British merchant ships.

Nisshin Dalian

Sends Ships to Sail Exclusively

In order to monopolize the Yangtze River shipping industry, the Japanese Nisshin Company and Dalian Steamship Company have sent ships to sail exclusively between Shanghai and Hankou, and also Jiujiang, and have entrusted a certain travel agency to post advertisements to solicit customers. The advertisements stated: "In order to facilitate travel to Hankou, we handle all procedures, send special personnel to escort, guarantee absolute safety along the way, and charge low prices." Small ferries are prepared to send passengers to Wusong to board the ship free of charge. Passengers are requested to register early. "The price to Hankou is 40 yuan in national currency, and to Jiujiang is 30 yuan in national currency. All are class prices." Japanese ships sailing between Shanghai and Hankou almost always have many every day.

It Is Difficult

for British Ships to Resume Navigation

The ships of the British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies that sail the Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Hunan routes, Taikoo are Wenzhou, Wuchang, Wuxue, Wulin, Shashi, etc., Jardine Matheson are Xianghe, Jianghe, Shihe, Tonghe, Ruihe, Pinghe, etc. After the Japanese refused to open the Yangtze River, the ships were either berthed in Shanghai, trapped in Hankou, or changed to sail the North Sha, Shanghai-Nantong lines, etc. This time, the Taikoo "Wulin" ship and the Jardine Matheson "Ruihe" ship, which were loaded with British naval troop movements to Shanghai, were blocked by the Japanese from carrying passengers on both British ships. No matter whether they were Chinese or foreigners, they were all prohibited. Therefore, the resumption of British ships on the Shanghai-Hankou line is difficult to achieve in the short term. The losses in the shipping industry are immeasurable.

Selling Nanyang Goods

Chamber of Commerce Certification

In Order to Have a Basis

When Paying Taxes

Goods sold in South America must be certified by the place of origin in accordance with the regulations of various South American countries, so that there is a basis when paying taxes. It is now heard that Chinese goods shipped from Shanghai must be stamped by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the invoice.

### Japanese Military Police Disguise Themselves as Coolies and Chase People on Nanjing Road; Three Japanese Soldiers Chase a Chinese Man, and Are Brought to the Police Station by an Indian Constable Together;—After Interrogation by the Police Station, They Are Released Together—

The English "China Press" reports that yesterday (the 13th) at about 7 p.m., the Japanese military police once again did not cooperate with the police station, but expanded their activities into the Public Concession, chasing a "Chinese hired by the Reformed Government" along Nanjing Road, and beat the Chinese in the Central Police Station. The details are recorded as follows: Three Japanese military police disguised as coolies came with the Chinese from Jiangwan and landed at the Waterfront Hotel on the Bund. The Japanese soldiers entered the Public Concession with the intention of arresting someone on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. The Chinese hired to point out the person they intended to arrest. When they arrived at

Waterfront Hotel

The Chinese Felt Afraid and Suddenly Changed His Mind and Jumped Out of the Window, Crossing the Bund and Running West Along Nanjing Road. The three Japanese soldiers hurriedly chased after him. When the Chinese was fleeing, he was carrying a bag. A foreigner was driving a car west and, seeing this situation, thought that the Chinese was robbing a bag and escaping, so he drove the car into the driveway of a gas station, blocking the sidewalk. The Chinese

Was Captured By Those Pursuing Him. At This Time

An Indian Constable

arrived at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road and led several people into the Central Police Station. The foreigner who drove the car to block the road went along with them. In a room at the Central Police Station, the Chinese was talking to the three people, and said angry words to the leader. Only then did he learn that the others were Japanese. The leader was a special agent officer. Hearing this, he beat the helpless Chinese. The police officer sitting at the desk left the desk and spoke to the Japanese military officer, saying that this could not happen on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek.

A Japanese Officer Heard About It, Only

Showed His Teeth and Smiled Cunningly

And Tried to Approach the Police Officer to Find Him, but Was Rejected. Although Deputy Police Chief Gibson Said Flatly That There Was Nothing Else, Only That the Chinese Was Detained by the Japanese Military Officer and Escaped, It Was Heard From Reliable Sources That the Chinese Was Hired by the "Reformed Government" Since October Last Year and Landed in the Public Concession With the Obvious Purpose of Indicating to the Japanese Soldiers a Certain Chinese Residing in the Concession. Police Officers Interrogated the Four Hostages, and Released Them All Together. The Chinese They Planned to Arrest

Had Probably Avoided

Them, and Then Drove Away

An Eyewitnessing Foreigner Who Blocked the Road Said That If He Had Known That the Chinese Was Escaping From the Japanese, He Would Not Have Blocked Him. Furthermore, the "North-China Daily News" Reports That Yesterday (the 13th) Just After 7 p.m., Three Armed Japanese Military Police Dressed as Chinese Coolies Chased a Man Dressed in a Zhongshan Suit Along Nanjing Road From the Bund. At First, Everyone Mistook the Chinese for a Customs Inspector. Many Chinese and Foreign People Witnessed It. When They Reached the Intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, They Suddenly Stopped Because an Indian Constable Stationed There Blocked Them and Asked the People to Follow Him Into the Central Police Station. It Was Later Learned That the

Chinese Chased

By the Japanese Soldiers Was a Member of the "Great Way" or "Reformed Government." As for the Reason Why the Japanese Military Police Wanted to Arrest Him, It Was Not Possible to Find Out Last Night. However, Seeing That the Japanese Military Police Were Dressed in Chinese Clothes and Did Not Cooperate With the Police Station, They Acted Within the Public Concession, and Everyone Began to Speculate. Late Until 1 a.m. Today (the 14th), Detectives From the Central Police Station and the Special Section Were Still Interrogating the Four. At Nearly 8 a.m., a Japanese Military Officer Arrived at the Central Police Station in a Car With

### Even in the Occupied Areas, Copper Coins Are in Short Supply; There Is a Rumor That Additional Three-Cent Subsidiary Currency Notes Will Be Issued; Merchants Use Stamps as Temporary Currency, Which Benefits the National Treasury

The "New News Agency" reporter asked a major financier about the remedy for the shortage of copper coins. According to him, various shops, bus and tram companies, etc., are now issuing their own substitute currency notes due to the shortage of copper coins. This is a temporary remedy. Judging from the current situation, if you want to permanently eliminate this kind of panic, you can only (1) transport a large number of copper-nickel coins to Shanghai to supply the market for circulation, (2) issue one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent subsidiary currency notes. The former may encounter difficulties due to transportation, and there is still a risk of being absorbed after being transported to Shanghai, so the latter's issuance of fractional notes is the best remedy. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has been studying this suggestion and has added a three-cent subsidiary currency note.

The Occupied Areas

Are the Same

According to transportation industry sources, the wave of panic over the lack of copper coins in Shanghai has now quickly invaded the occupied areas. Recently, the market in occupied areas such as Subei and Wuxi has also felt a lack of copper coins, and it is difficult to find change, which proves that traitors are driven by profit and are unscrupulous. It is learned that buying copper coins in the occupied areas has long become a secretly open event, which is the same as the massive smuggling of scrap copper and iron,

Stamps Sell Well, Benefiting the National Treasury

After the shortage of copper subsidiary coins in this city, all sectors have used stamps and stamps as substitutes. In the first few days, most used stamps because stamps are more commonly used. But in the last one or two days, they have all switched to stamps because (1) there are not many one-cent stamps, which are not enough to meet the needs. There are more one-cent stamps, which can be borrowed in large quantities for circulation. (2) Once a stamp is damaged, the post office must treat it as underpaid according to regulations. Stamps are freely affixed by all industries and sectors, and must be stamped before they are cancelled. If there is slight stain, it will not be voided. (3) If stamps flow into the occupied areas, the other party can also affix and use them. There is absolutely no such worry about stamps. (4) Stamps are national taxes, and their circulation indirectly benefits the national treasury. For the above four reasons, the stamps sold by various tobacco shops are very popular. Also, because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, the invoices and receipts opened by various industries must be affixed with stamps in accordance with the law. Those worth more than one yuan are affixed with one cent, those worth more than three yuan are affixed with two cents, those worth more than ten yuan are affixed with four cents, and those worth more than one hundred yuan are affixed with six cents, so the demand is greater.

Major Companies

Affix Stamps in Accordance With the Law

Major companies on Nanjing Road, such as Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, Lihua, and China National Products Company, have long been affixing stamps to all invoices and receipts in accordance with the law. The Da Sun Company will also comply from today.

The Municipal Federation Branch

Issues Substitute Currency Notes

The Xinzha Road Municipal 16th District Branch, repeatedly reported by members that there is a shortage of copper coins in the market, and business is difficult, and they have repeatedly requested to find ways to remedy it. The association believes that this matter is of great importance, and especially at 4 p.m. yesterday, it invited various merchants to discuss it on their own. More than one hundred representatives from Jiukang Pawnshop, Gongda, Zhengda, Dashunchang, Maotaixin, Chengdaxin, Cuihe, Qiantai Chang, Qianchang, Dashun Gong, Tongfuyong, Taifeng, Taikang, Dachangxiang, Dexingchang, Rongda, Zhang Jinji, Yuchangde, Zhang Xinhe, Henghexing, Song Shengxin, Lao Wenbao, Shou Kangyuan, Xinhe, Yuan Zengxiang, Lao Jin Da, Tong Fengyu, Zhongxing, Zheng Changxiang, Wanxing, Zhenkang, Dekang, Shunkang, and other shops, after careful discussion, decided to issue a joint temporary substitute currency note. The regulations are as follows: (1) Name it "Xinzha Road Commercial Temporary Joint Substitute Currency Note." (2) Only one type of "one cent" substitute currency note will be issued, and all will be numbered and have stubs. (3) All substitute currency notes will be stamped with a convenient seal and co-sealed by the participating merchants. (4) This substitute currency note can be exchanged for one jiao of legal currency at the participating merchants after accumulating ten points. The list of participating merchants will be distributed to each merchant for posting. (5) If a counterfeit currency note is found by a merchant, it should be reported immediately for investigation. (6) Once the government has decided on a remedy, the substitute currency notes will be recalled immediately. (7) Wang Maoqing, Zhu Yunsheng, Wang Zhaoji, Chen Jicheng, Zhu Yutao, Qu Qiufang, Chen Weiwen, Wang Yuncai, Hu Jianren, Chen Cailing, Liu Yunqing, and other eleven people were elected as members of the currency and steel seal safekeeping committee. (8) The currency will be deposited in a bank as a special fund. When withdrawing it, it must be signed and sealed by five members of the safekeeping committee. Then, the number of currency notes needed by each merchant was determined on the spot, totaling 750 yuan. Merchants continued to participate, so it was decided that the limit for this temporary one-cent substitute currency note would be 1,000 yuan.

Shortage of Copper Coins,

The Panic Has Not Been Eliminated

This city has experienced a shortage of copper subsidiary coins many times since the war, but none has been as severe as this time. In the past, although there was a shortage, there were still a few in circulation on the market, and the exchange rate was only slightly higher. Unexpectedly, this time, the shortage of copper subsidiary coins has completely disappeared from the market. What is the reason for this? In addition to traitors profiteering, hoarding, or smuggling them abroad, the obstruction of the supply source is the biggest factor. Therefore, although the panic caused by the lack of fractional coins in this city has been remedied by various industries on their own, it has not been completely eliminated.

A Few Words on Loquats: The loquat is a precious fruit of Southeast China, blooming in winter and bearing fruit in summer. The large ones are like chicken eggs, and the small ones are like longans.

### Letter

Mr. Da Zhong Bi,

I was in Hong Kong previously before coming to Shanghai, and met with many friends and relatives who said on Wednesday June 7, your newspaper published "Pudong Guerrilla Captain Fan Gencai, because I have special influence in southwestern Shanghai, recently incited the guerrilla comrades in Pudong, issuing a reward of 2,000 yuan for my arrest," and I found it strange. I have served as secretary and intelligence chief of the Military Commission, but I have not participated in any political work since I went to Hong Kong to do business last summer. How can I go to Pudong? I think someone is impersonating me, resulting in this misunderstanding. Also, according to many people, there is another person named Tao Xisheng, but the pronunciation is the same but the characters are different, which has nothing to do with me. It concerns my reputation, and I am afraid of spreading misinformation. Please correct it. Sincerely, Tao Xuesheng.

### Anecdotes of the Medicine King

— Ding Jimin

Now, the birthday of the Medicine King is not clearly distinguished in most places. It is almost a mixed birthday of Shennong, Wei Xundao, and the Medicine King Bodhisattva. From a dialectical point of view, of course, Shennong representing the Medicine King is the most original basis. It is indeed very meaningful to commemorate the great inventions of the ancient sages.

Records of the Medicine King Temple are rarely seen in various books. However, most cities and counties have Medicine King Temples. If it is said that they were automatically established by local people, not due to government coercion, I am afraid it would not be so widespread, would it? The Yuan Dynasty once issued a national order to build the Three Sovereigns Temple. Later generations did not verify it and passed on the wrong information, turning it into the Medicine King Temple. Regarding this point, we can cite the Three Sovereigns Temple Records from Yuan Yu Bosheng's "Daoguo Xuegulu" as proof:

The Three Sovereigns Temple Records Newly Built in Lean County, Fuzhou Road: The Three Sovereigns Temple is the shrine of Emperor Fuxi Shennong. From the national capital to the counties, all medical scholars must establish it. This is the system of our country.

Reconstruction of the Two Sovereigns Temple in Cili Prefecture, Lizhou Road: According to the system of the state, from the national capital to the counties, there is no remote communication. The governors and officials must build temples and worship the Three Sovereigns. …

Reconstruction of the Medical Three Sovereigns Temple in Chongren County: Our Emperor Shizu unified the characters and took the system of ancient and modern times. Everything was restored, and the virtue of heaven and earth was taken as virtue, and the ability of the saints was taken as ability. All that was considered for the people and things was complete and thorough. The Three Sovereigns Temple is one of them.

The Three Sovereigns Temple Records Newly Built in Fenyi County, Yuanzhou Road: …The fixed system is to worship only the society and the masters. Our dynasty started building the Three Sovereigns Temple to worship Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor. From the national capital to the counties, the three are worshipped.

After reading these records, we can understand that Yuan Shizu did use the power of the emperor to urge the establishment of "Three Sovereigns Temples" everywhere, and did not establish "Medicine King Temples." Later, I don't know how it went wrong. However, in the early Ming Dynasty, the scholar-officials had already discovered this error. Therefore, Emperor Taizu of Ming issued the following order:

In the fourth year of Hongwu, the edict said: The Three Sovereigns accumulated heaven and established the foundation, and opened the source of teaching and transformation for all ages. Is it possible to attribute it to the Medicine Master? No one in the world's counties should blaspheme!

From the early Yuan Dynasty to the early Ming Dynasty, only eight or nine years passed in between. However, the good "Three Sovereigns Temple" was mistaken for the "Medicine King Temple." No wonder Emperor Taizu of Ming said: "Is it possible to attribute it to the Medicine Master?" Later, Mao Tuizhi of the Qing Dynasty also mentioned this matter in the Chinese and Western Medical Talks. He said:

Some people use the image of Wei Xundao as the Medicine King and sculpt another herb garment, which is no different from the image of Shennong. Based on the words in the almanac, the birthday of the Medicine King on April 28th, it is alluded to confuse. …

Mao's argument is inevitably too affirmative. Shennong's merit of tasting herbs is vastly different from that of Wei. It is not appropriate to respect him as the Medicine King? From the perspective of modern times, he should be honored as the Medicine King of our country, that is, the ancestor of pharmacology in the world.

### Portrait of the Medicine Emperor Shennong

### The Meaning of "Medicine Emperor's Birthday"

— Chen Cunren

Commemorating the "Ancestor of World Medicine"

Dr. Wu Liande wrote a preface to "History of Chinese Medicine," and his opening sentence said: "Emperor Shennong is actually the ancestor of world medicine and has the most glorious history!" Today, Chinese science is lagging behind in everything. However, Shennong's invention of materia medica is the reason why we can still occupy the first place in the world's medical history. Various countries commemorate their scientific inventors with annual sacrifices, centennial sacrifices, or millennial sacrifices, all of which are grand and cited as the "glory of the country." Our country has the Medicine Emperor's Birthday, and the whole country worships and pays homage every year. Although its birthday is mixed with the Buddhist Medicine King's Birthday, the significance of commemorating Shennong is not wrong. Now, from a world perspective, the Medicine Emperor's Birthday can be said to be the memorial day of the ancestor of world medicine, and it is also the only "glory that enhances the country" in our country.

Shennong's invention of materia medica is known to the world. It can also be confirmed in historical records, such as:

The Annals of Emperors and Kings in the Records of the Historian says: "Emperor Yan Shennong was born in Jiangshui, so he was surnamed Jiang. He was born with sacred virtue and first taught the world to cultivate the five grains and eat them, so as to save the evils of killing life. He tasted herbs and announced medicine to heal diseases, so as to save the lives of the wounded. The people use it every day without knowing it, and he wrote four volumes of Materia Medica."

The preface to A and B Classics says: "In ancient times, Shennong first tasted herbs and knew hundreds of medicines. Yi Yin used his talent as an Asian sage to compile and use Shennong's Materia Medica to make soups."

Search for Gods says: "Shennong's vermilion whip, hundreds of medicines, fully knows their flat, poisonous, cold, and warm nature, and the taste they dominate to sow hundreds of grains."

The History of Chinese Medicine says: "The rise of medicine in our country began with Shennong. Therefore, Shennong is the ancestor of medicine in our country. At that time, the people's intelligence was not enlightened, and they had no fixed place to live. They did not know the method of farming and animal husbandry. They used naturally produced plants as living materials. Those plants containing vomiting and diarrhea properties were also directly taken. Shennong distinguished which one was vomiting, which one was diarrhea, and which grass and tree could not be used as food. He also used vomiting grass and trees to treat heartache and depression, and used diarrhea grass and trees to treat abdominal distension and constipation. These are the origins of medical knowledge. The Historical Records and Outline Mirror both say that Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and first had medicine. Huainanzi Xiuwu Xun said that Shennong first taught the people to taste the flavors of hundreds of herbs."

Shennong's invention of materia medica has been used to treat diseases, maintain health, and reproduce the population for five thousand years, I don't know how many millions of people. His long-term benefits and deep blessings are unparalleled in the world. The medicines listed in Shennong's Materia Medica are still the main commodities of our country's export trade, and their legacy has almost spread to the world. During this period of resistance, the government also knew that the export of Chinese medicine was one of the main forces for earning foreign exchange. Therefore, it specially established the Central Drug Research Institute in Kunming to specialize in researching, identifying, and adjusting exports. According to recent publications, the annual export volume can reach 100 million yuan. The importance of farmers' trust can be imagined, and it will greatly benefit the national strength during the war. Therefore, today's commemoration of the Medicine Emperor has another important meaning.

It is also not impossible.

During the Sui and Tang dynasties, when Buddhism prevailed in China, there was also the name "Medicine King" in Buddhist scriptures, but it was not valued by our scholars and officials. Furthermore, they also supported a domestic Medicine King: It may also be useful to excerpt some records here for everyone's reference:

Wei Xundao, styled Cizang, was from Jingzhao in the Tang Dynasty and was proficient in medicine. During the Wu Zetian period, he served as the imperial physician and was promoted to Guanglu Qing. He often brought a black dog with him and dispensed medicine to help people. The people respected him and called him the Medicine King.

Wei Xundao, styled Cizang, was from the Tang Dynasty. He was a saint in medicine, and people admired him. Many doctors also made portraits together to worship him.

When Duke Zhongxian was six or seven years old, he was very ill. Suddenly he said: A Taoist priest led a dog to feed me medicine, and I got better after sweating. Zhongxian Wang Han Qi also.

Wei Shanjun of the Tang Dynasty Wu Zetian Dynasty in Jingzhao fasted and practiced Taoism, and once carried a black dog named Niaolong, which is commonly called the Medicine King.

The surname of the Medical King is Wei, his name is Gu, his style is Teacher, and he is from the country of Shule. In the mid-summer of the Tang Kaiyuan period, people suffered from diseases, and he administered medicine everywhere, and all were cured. The emperor respected him. At that time, he was called the Medicine King.

The above can be seen in Tang Book Biographies of Fangji, Tongyin Old Stories, Biographies of Immortals, and Materia Medica. It can be seen that between the Tang and Song dynasties, Wei Xundao was already the domestic Medicine King of our country.

There is a Buddhist scripture called "Medicine King and Medicine Zang Bodhisattva Sutra." In the Lotus Sutra, there is a chapter called The Past Life of the Medicine King Bodhisattva, which is evidence that there is another Medicine King in Buddhism. I once found a picture of the Twenty-five Perfect Figures of the Ming Dynasty Five (Picture of the Medicine King Bodhisattva and the Medicine Zang Bodhisattva), and now I am printing it out as collateral evidence.

There is also a so-called Jiva (translated as Jicheng) in Buddhist scriptures, who is actually the Medicine King of India. All kinds of herbs and foods must be tried by him. This kind of situation is roughly the same as our country's records about Shennong.

### A Brief Biography of Wei Xundao, Who Is Called the Medicine King Together with Shennong

— Zhang Qingyun

Shennong being the Medicine King of our country is already very clear, but the world's use of Wei Xundao as the Medicine King has been circulating for a long time and cannot be overthrown. Therefore, there is a saying that "Shennong, Wei Xundao, and the Medicine King Bodhisattva" are one body. Examining the medical history of ancient and modern times records: "Wei Xundao, styled Cizang, was good at medicine and often brought a black dog with him to dispense medicine and help people. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang valued him and promoted him to an official, but he refused. He was admired by the world as the Medicine King." However, there are also errors in his book records, such as Wei Shanjun or Wei Guizang, and deliberately mythologize his saying, saying that "his black dog turned into a black dragon and carried him to heaven," etc., which is close to bizarre and untrustworthy.

### The Evolution of the Medicine Emperor's Mausoleum in Hangzhou

— Jin Zheming

During the Southern Crossing of the Song Dynasty, Shang Li carried the statue of the Pihuang Temple to the Jiangting Pavilion on Chenghuang Mountain in Hangzhou. At that time, there was a patient who accidentally went to pray, and it felt very effective. It was regarded as the Shennong Temple, and the fire was extremely prosperous for a while. In the fourth year of Shaoding (1231), it was destroyed by fire; Lizong erected a new temple on the old site and named it "Huiling Temple." In August of the fifth year of Xianchun (1269), Empress Dowager Shouhe Shengfu bestowed silver to repair it, and painted twenty-four immortal doctors in the two wings, which people referred to as the predecessors who assisted Shennong in collecting medicine. In fact, what they worshiped were the Heavenly Master, Ying Bo, Bo Gao, Shao Shi, Tai Yi, Lei Gong, Yi Yin, Cang Gong, Hua Tuo, Huangfu Mi, Chao Yuanfang, Wei Sicang, Qian Yi, Liu Wansu, Li Guo, Gui Souqu, Yu Fu, Tong Jun, Ma Shuai, Shen Ying Wang Bian Que, Zhang Zhongjing, Wang Shuhe, Ge Hong, Sun Simiao, Wang Bing, Zhu Hong, Zhang Yuansu, Zhang Yanxiu, etc., all were predecessors in the ancient and medieval medical circles, and were not related to Shennong's collection of medicine. Huiling Temple suffered another fire disaster in the ninth year of Kangxi (1770). In the seventeenth year (1678), Li Shizhen spent money to rebuild it. In the twenty-first year of Jiaqing, (1816), it was rebuilt by pharmaceutical merchants. During the Daoguang period, it was repaired again. Later, the Hong Yang Rebellion destroyed the Temple Father. In the tenth year of Tongzhi (1871), it was rebuilt by pharmaceutical merchants in Hangzhou and renamed "Medicine Emperor Hall." During the reconstruction, the painted portraits of the twenty-four sages were reshaped into statues, and the statues of the Heavenly Doctor and Pihuang were added. According to the intention of the people at that time, Shennong was the first generation Medicine King, Pihuang was the second generation Medicine King, and the Heavenly Doctor was the third generation Medicine King. In fact, they were all arbitrarily fabricated and had no basis in historical facts. In front of the twenty-four statues in the temple, wooden tablets were erected, on which were written the titles and the diseases they were in charge of, all of which had no historical basis; so that the meaning of commemorating the sages was completely lost, and it became a place where ordinary superstitious patients prayed for immortal prescriptions, which is truly regrettable. Hangzhou was originally the base for the establishment of religion by gods. In that era of divine power, it was a natural trend for the Medicine King Temple to become a place of incense. Every year on the twenty-eighth day of April (lunar calendar), during the birthday of the Medicine King, all pharmaceutical farmers and merchants go up the mountain to burn incense and worship, and eat Tuckahoe cakes and other things to celebrate, which still does not lose the sincerity of commemorating the sages. After the Republic of China, it has not been held for many years.

### Four Kinds of Food

— Song Zhaorong

The following foods are used as daily snacks and have the effect of treating diseases without any bias. They have been used for a long time and are very effective, so I specially introduce them as follows:

(1) Lily: Villagers often bring them to the market for sale, and they are very easy to buy. First separate each small petal, then remove the thin film around each small petal, stew until cooked, and add a little white sugar. It tastes very sweet. The common people regard white lily as a good product for treating long-term coughs and tuberculosis. In fact, it is not necessary to use white flowers. Anyone with weak lungs, who is prone to colds, or who suffers from coughs for a long time; or has developed tuberculosis and often coughs up blood, can use lily as a daily food, which is more effective than taking greasy products every day.

(2) Chinese Yam: Villagers also bring them to the market for sale. Eating them cooked is very effective in nourishing deficiency and reducing damage. National doctors also often use this in prescriptions: and it is even more effective in treating lower wasting, which is what Western medicine calls diabetes. Anyone who urinates immediately after drinking, a lot and turbidly, is a symptom of lower wasting. This product is not only an effective medicine for national doctors to treat lower wasting, but it is also more suitable as a daily food.

(3) Walnuts: Available in southern goods stores. It can nourish blood and brain. Those with less hair, who are not black, and are prone to hair loss, can mash it and take it regularly (or add red dates, longan, white sugar, etc.). It has miraculous effects. Elderly people with phlegm drinking disease, who cough and wheeze incessantly in winter, can mash this product, take one or two spoons a day and rinse it with boiled water. It has the effect of curing phlegm drinking. Those with weak spleen and stomach and loose stools can remove the oil floating on the upper part: those who catch a cold and cough and wheeze suddenly increase, can add one or two slices of old ginger for the best results.

(4) Job's Tears: Those with a humid constitution, thick and turbid tongue coating, or those with wet sores, can cook this and drink it regularly to gradually relieve the accumulation of dampness from urination. And according to recent research, it is said that its nourishing power is superior to all kinds of grains, and it can also treat pulmonary tuberculosis. Its benefits can be known.

### Introduction

— (Editor)

The recently published "Drug Special Issue" has very rich content and includes manuscripts such as "History of Materia Medica." It is more interesting to read it here in commemoration of Shennong's birthday. The publishing house is at 76 Liumei Road. Please enclose one point of postage to request a copy.

### The Origin of the Medicine King Bodhisattva

— (Liu Zongzhou)

According to the "Medicine King and Medicine Superior Bodhisattva Sutra," in the distant past, there was a Buddha called "One Lapis Lazuli Light Illuminating Tathagata." The era was peaceful, and the country was named "Suspended Victory Banner." After that Buddha's Nirvana, during the Dharma Image Age, many Bhikkhus resolved to cultivate themselves. Among them, one Bhikkhu named "Sun Repository" was intelligent and wise, explaining the Great Vehicle's equality and great wisdom to all. At that time, there was also an elder named "Star Constellation Light," who, having heard of the Great Vehicle, was filled with joy. He then used Haritaki fruits and medicines to support the Bhikkhu Sun Repository and all. As a result, he developed a great Bodhi mind. At that time, Star Constellation Light's younger brother, named "Electric Light," also followed his brother, holding various good medicines, offering them to Sun Repository and all, and making great vows. Therefore, the assembly praised the brother as "Medicine King" and the younger brother as "Medicine Superior," who are the Medicine King and Medicine Superior Bodhisattvas of today. Later, the Medicine King cultivated pure conduct for a long time, made twelve great vows to save sentient beings from the source of disease, cure nameless chronic illnesses, and when all his vows were fulfilled, he became a Buddha in the future world, named "Pure Eye Tathagata," also known as "Medicine Master Lapis Lazuli Light Tathagata" or "Medicine Master King," and also called "Great Medicine King Buddha." (There is a jade-carved Medicine King Buddha statue in Siam), with his right shoulder bare, sitting in the lotus position, hand on knee, holding a pill, resembling a Sangha member.

### Englishmen Propose Presenting a Train

British people deeply appreciate the benefits that trains bring to people, and are particularly regretful that they have not yet been implemented in China. Therefore, they have donated money to quickly build a train railway and present it to the court, hoping that the Emperor will personally see its convenience and precision, and then implement it in various places. The initiators of this undertaking are an English public figure named Mr. Sou Deli and a textile magnate named Mr. Bai En Da. A total of 60,000 gold dollars were used, equivalent to 200,000 taels of silver. Since it is presented as a gift for the Emperor's viewing, the beauty of the vehicles and the exquisiteness of the workmanship can be imagined. It was heard that there was such a proposal last month, but then the British people heard that there were plans to build a steam-powered railway along the route from Tianjin to the capital, so the previous proposal was temporarily suspended. Later, it was learned that this information was unsubstantiated, so the previous proposal was resumed. Currently, workers are being hired and materials are being purchased, and everyone is showing their skills, waiting for its completion, there will surely be something worth observing.

### Shandong to Establish a Manufacturing Plant

Shandong Province is planning to establish a manufacturing plant similar to the Shanghai Arsenal. Yesterday, several commissioners from Guangdong came to Shanghai, sent by the Governor of Shandong, and will soon go to Shandong Province to discuss matters and make arrangements. It is also heard that the plant will most likely be located in Yantai.

### Strange Birth of a Fishing Woman

Outside Qingtai Gate in Hangzhou, the wife of a fisherman named Yu was about to give birth. A few days ago, at night, she had excruciating abdominal pain. Yu immediately invited a midwife. Soon, a baby was born with a cry. The midwife looked at it and exclaimed in horror! Because the child had four horns on its head, no pair of eyes, a mouth on the tip of its nose, and spurs growing on its toes. What was even stranger was that its ears were as large as a pig's. Everyone who saw it was shocked. Its voice was very high-pitched and chirped like a bird. It died on the day of the full moon. This matter was witnessed by a friend from Hangzhou and is certainly not a fabrication. Some say that Yu laid his nets on the seawall, floating with his family, and was influenced by the Qi of a Jiaolong dragon, so this strange birth occurred.

### What is Expected of Readers of the Supplement

— Shangqing

This is not me being mysterious, nor am I exaggerating: if it is correct to say that the importance of contributors to a supplement is greater than that of the editor, then the importance of readers is greater than that of contributors, especially so. The reason is very simple: the editor is the distributor, the contributor is the supplier, and the reader is the demander. According to the general rule, demand can determine everything, so readers can also influence editors and contributors. In addition, readers make up the absolute majority, readers are the public, and editors and contributors must obey them.

Since readers have supreme authority over a supplement, I especially want to express my hopes to them.

There are many readers, mostly young students, who think that editors and contributors are always talented people, their articles are always good, and their opinions are always correct. Therefore, sometimes when they see works that are truly incomprehensible or contrary to their own ideas, they gloss over them and dare not ask questions. This is not right. They should recognize that editors and contributors are by no means perfect geniuses and always have shortcomings, so I hope that such readers will not be self-deprecating.

However, there are many readers, mostly older, but also some younger, who are the opposite of the former. They think that editors are always muddleheads and contributors are always mediocre. They don't even bother to glance at their supplement. They want the editor to consult them and other contributors to wait respectfully for them to be satisfied. This is also not right. After all, the establishment of a supplement must have its reasons for existence. It is not possible to dismiss its editors and contributors in this way, so I hope that such readers will not be arrogant.

Readers who are neither self-deprecating nor arrogant are proper readers. I hope that if they have any opinions about a supplement, in other words, about the editor or contributors of that supplement, they can express them as much as possible. The way to do this is to write a letter to the editor or to become a contributor themselves and submit an article. In this way, the editor and other contributors will certainly benefit from your opinions, and all readers, including yourself, will be positively influenced by you.

When you express your opinions in this way, you will naturally know that you should state what you disapprove of and what you hope for; you will naturally also know that you should not be timid or overzealous, but speak calmly and rationally. This is the attitude you should take, and you know it, so I don't need to say more. But when you use this attitude to express your opinions, especially when writing a letter to the editor, I hope you will have the following two resolutions:

Accepting goodness. If you realize that you are wrong, you will be willing to retract your opinion and will definitely not argue unreasonably or become angry and create useless and harmful trouble for both sides. Because the supplement belongs to the public, the public will never allow you to act selfishly.

Rejecting evil. Conversely, if you find that you are not wrong, I hope you will persist and repeatedly state your case to achieve your goal, or at least to make the supplement you are paying attention to modify itself to a point where it is somewhat satisfactory. Because the supplement belongs to the public, the public will naturally support your legitimate demands.

Of course, I know that the difficulty lies in not knowing whether your own opinion is wrong. Therefore, I hope that you will not express your opinion until you are fully confident and fully understand a problem. When you have real insight, you will then put your attitude and resolution into practice.

In short, I hope that every reader of a supplement will treat the supplement they are reading as their own property and imagine themselves as the editor or the contributor. You must cherish it: if it is good, you must promote and magnify it; if it is not good, you must correct it and help it. Every proper supplement is always willing to hear the opinions of its readers, and I hope that you will fulfill your responsibility as a reader and satisfy it.

It is true that a supplement can guide readers; however, it is also true that readers can promote a supplement. Only when readers and the supplement cooperate, that is, cooperate with the editors and contributors, can both the supplement and the readers benefit.

Think about it: which supplement should be promoted and magnified? Which supplement should be corrected or helped? I hope that you will put it into practice as soon as you think of it!

### Presenting a Flag

— Shengdan

—Battlefield Notes—

Returning from Macheng to Songbu, the sky was pouring rain. A truck used for transportation was racing through the muddy night, staggering like a drunkard. We didn't bring rain gear, so we had to huddle together, covering ourselves with dirty tarpaulins. But the rain was getting heavier and heavier, as if a waterfall was pouring down and a river was flowing backwards, soaking us from head to toe, like drowned rats. However, thinking of the brave fighters in the trenches, even when it rained and the water was over their knees, they still maintained their spirits and composure; therefore, we were not only calm in the face of the storm, but also grateful for the kindness of heaven in washing away our travel dust.

The truck drove into the heavily wooded military supervisory department. Councilor Chen had already prepared dinner; after dinner, I brought up the topic of rural visits and told him about it. Director Zheng of the military supervisory department had also served in military transportation during the Northern Expedition. According to him, the most distinctive political work was done by the Eighth Route Army, and the promotion in Guangxi was exemplary. He said that the achievements in Macheng were certainly satisfactory. "The 'anti-bandit' movement cannot succeed without the cooperation of the common people!" he said firmly.

Councilor Chen was quite talkative, speaking with a strong Chongming accent, similar to Cao Juren's Pujiang accent, with a "same tune played differently" feel. It was truly unexpected to be able to share a bed with him in the wind and rain amidst the raging flames of war.

"There's no problem with Tianjiazhen, Wuhan won't waver."

"Even if there is a problem, we will never abandon Wuhan!"

That's how the conversation ended that night. So, the evacuation of Wuhan depended on Guangzhou. Otherwise, the three towns would not have fallen so quickly. The next morning, we prepared to refresh ourselves and decided to go to Huangchuan. At this time, the battle on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway had unfolded with extreme intensity, and rumors even spread that Xinyang was about to be abandoned. "Once they step into the Dabie Mountains, it's no different from sinking into a quagmire. They can only become ghosts in a foreign land and can never hope to return alive," said Director Zheng, a happy smile flitting across his round face. But just as we were about to bid farewell to Songbu, the military supervisory department received a telegram from Huangchuan, informing us that General Li Zongren would be coming to Hubei soon, and the news that the cultural circles of Wuhan would be coming to comfort the troops was also confirmed at the same time. This was truly unexpected good news. Apart from Lao Yao and me, the other seven were all representatives of the people of Anhui Province, and their mission was to present a flag to pay their respects. After the event, they would still have to return to Anhui, so we traveled together.

Just two hours later, General Li had returned from the front, looking heroic, spirited, and not at all tired. After resting for a while, he met with the representatives presenting the flag. His dignified and amiable attitude could not help but inspire respect.

"Ah, ah! You've worked so hard!" General Li said first, smiling warmly.

"We should have come to the front to present the flag. Please forgive us, Commander!"

Miss Wu apologized on behalf of everyone, and in a solemn ceremony, she presented the red silk flag. Then, she expressed the heartfelt support of the people of Anhui in simple and clear language, and then bid farewell and left. "A great leader of the national resistance!" Miss Wu praised sincerely.

### Crazy Melody (Woodcut)

— Tianji

### Impressions of a Journey

— Li Jinming

I.

Like those with eccentricities, I like the wilderness, the primitive mountains and forests. The sea is also something I love, especially on a calm beach when the wind has died down and the waves have receded. But I also followed the trend of modern poets, visiting places like the Longevity Hill, Yuelu Mountain, and West Lake, but I never got any noteworthy impressions. Accompanied by urban society, these travels often become so formulaic that one feels a sense of "unease" if one is short of even a penny, like going to a Cantonese teahouse and sitting in a five- or seven-point hall. When I pick up a pen to write travel notes about these places, the mountains must be "sturdy," the clouds must be "thick," and the streams must be "gurgling." Without this kind of style, the travel notes lack artistic charm.

But to look at famous scenic spots with Zola's glasses is intentionally ruining Zola's name. Originally, travel notes were a shallow term. To write novels as travel notes or to write travel notes as novels is both meddling.

II.

In April 1938, I made my first tour of Mount Heng, accompanied only by the Peng brothers, Qi Xing and Zhen, who were from Guangdong.

Traveling with people from other provinces, due to differences in language and perceptions, one feels more novelty compared to locals. Their hometown was in Lufeng. They had drifted here from their address in Guangzhou, partly to avoid the bombing and partly to find friends. Outwardly, they seemed fortunate, but inwardly, they harbored endless sadness.

From Chongshan County to Hengshan Town, the twenty-minute car ride was silent, as if we were going to a funeral. The scenery on both sides of the road was monotonous—mountain ranges, mountain ranges, mountain ranges, but covered with the tender green of spring, as if telling a beginner in watercolor to use more yellow and green paint on the paper. Among the passengers were wounded soldiers, refugees, resident gentry, small merchants, old farmers, and county officials with horse faces. Hengshan Town was not small, comparable in size to Haidian in Beijing or Jiangwan Town in Shanghai. There was a park on the eastern side, still under construction. The stone archway inscribed by Liu Yinggu had been standing for six or seven years. Facing south, there was Yuyun School, resembling a wealthy person's villa. Near the town, there was a public sports ground with slogans in white characters on a blue background, suddenly adding a kind of spiritual excitement to passersby. We transferred from the bus station to the main street, silently aware of the shops along the street, walking unevenly, following the ups and downs of the stone slabs. After a long time, we found a restaurant with a newly changed signboard.

The owner was from Xiangtan. He recited the names of the dishes to us like a schoolboy reciting the Thousand Character Classic.

We casually ordered three dishes and spread out a map of Mount Heng, discussing how to proceed like a group of staff officers. The Xiangtan owner brought the tea and told us casually, "One day is not enough for a visit. One day is just running around. Two days is just looking at the mountains. Three days allows you to see the temples. Five or six days is enough to write poetry or paint seven or eight percent of a mustard garden. It depends on what you gentlemen plan to do. We can hire sedan chairs for you here."

The Xiangtan "wanderer" had some descriptive skills. We couldn't help but let his experience determine the length of our trip.

Seeing that the two Pengs were from other provinces, the Xiangtan owner said to them:

"Since Boss He (referring to He Jian) took charge a few years ago, Mount Heng has really been worth a visit. There is a fixed price for riding a sedan chair, and a fixed price of one yuan a day for staying in a temple, big or small. In the beginning, it was more than ten folds per li, resting every eight or nine steps, but now it's different. You can really race on the road. In the beginning, not a single hair grew on Mount Heng. There was no tree left even where there was soil. Now, there are various planting associations managing it. In the beginning, the temples were crooked and dilapidated, leaking when it rained and letting in wind. The big monks extorted money, and the small monks stole. Now, all the temples have been renovated, and the monks are all high-class. In the beginning, you had to put up your feet when it was dark, and you would either see tigers or encounter robbers. Now, there are police patrolling every day, and even beggars have been driven away..."

His description made us really feel the extraordinary nature of Mount Heng. We increased our interest a lot.

III.

Mount Heng was originally famous for being barren. There are too many barren peaks. Apart from the lush greenery in the valleys and the solitary pines standing upright among the rocks, there is little grass. The newly planted saplings are also withered and do not grow. The places with forests, flowers, streams are mostly owned by wealthy people and monks, as if even the few birds are like ladies of the house. The water flowing from Lusi Pool and Huayan Lake flows straight down the rocks along the road. Looking back to the source, it is really unknown where it comes from and where it flows to. No wonder there are flash floods, and it can only be allowed to flood the fields, even drowning water buffalo.

Some of the construction is clearly very clumsy. I found a large bridge connecting the east and west cliffs. Strangely enough, they built it like a pile of walls, without opening any holes. Where does the water flow through? They had to destroy the bricks and stones, demolishing a project that had cost tens of thousands of yuan, even washing away the roads on both sides. How clumsy is that!

There are no other kinds of buildings in this area. The Cantonese don't understand what's good about this situation. I boredly bragged a little, saying:

"Historically, this mountain is very famous. According to legend, Dayu came here to control the floods. About twenty miles from here, there is a temple called Guangji Temple. Next to it is the Yuhuang City, which was left to commemorate him. This is a game from prehistoric times. Later, there were many people who left their fragrance on the mountain, including those from the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties. This is probably very reliable. If we walk another six or seven miles, we will reach Bianshan Pavilion, where we can find Li Jing's place of seclusion."

The Cantonese are not very interested in history. They mostly moved from ancient environments to the Lingnan area. By custom, they only understand whether a place has production and whether it has practical benefits. (To be continued)

### (III) The Source of Love

— Sang

If I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. For love does not boast, and love is the greatest of the three elements indispensable to life: faith, hope, and love. Love does no harm to others. With love, one can be all-encompassing. Hatred stirs up strife, while love covers over all wrongs. I hope that those who run schools in this world can practice education of love, that hospitals can be hospitals of love, and that people can treat each other with equal love. But unfortunately, people do not know what love is! For the love that can be found in this world is nothing more than one-sided, narrow, conditional, carnal, and relative! Therefore, I now introduce to readers the source of true love. The Bible says: "God is love. God sent his son Jesus Christ into the world. While we were still sinners, Jesus died for us. God's love has been demonstrated to us in this way. Because love comes from God, everyone who loves is born of God and knows God." God's love began to flow when Jesus died on the cross for sinners. I wonder, reader, are you willing to receive the irrigation of this great source of love? Are you willing to let Christ dwell in your heart through your faith, so that your love may be rooted and grounded, and you may live a life of love?

### A Precious Program from a "Feng Family Home Performance"

— Li Feishu

Random Memories of the Plum Blossom, Part Three

Since Master Plum Blossom published the sensational theater news in this publication, until this publication stated that the so-called "Bai Family Home Performance was canceled due to the obstruction of General Wu Ziyu," in these few days, it stirred up a storm in the entire theater world of the isolated island! Theater fans and non-theater fans alike told each other, as if they had obtained a treasure. I knew that it was far from the truth and did not make any statement on behalf of Mr. Mei Lanfang, because in such a gloomy and suffocating environment, it was better to give the masses of the isolated island a stimulating stimulant. Just like the news of the conflict between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo, why necessarily say that it is a "rumor" and disappoint people!

The sensational theater news mentioned Ms. Feng Biqi. This time, I recalled the grand occasion of the Feng family home performance in the eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China. Ms. Feng's husband was Mr. Feng Youwei, the former "President of the Central Bank." Mr. Feng was a lifelong confidant of Mr. Mei, and Mr. Mei has achieved what he is today thanks to Mr. Feng's guidance, teaching, and advice. That year's home performance was for the 70th birthday of Madam Feng. All the first-class celebrities of old Beijing, except for Wang Yaoqing, Shang Xiaoyun, and Ma Lianliang, who seemed to be out of town and were not invited, and everyone else from all branches such as sheng, dan, jing, mo, chou, martial sheng, martial dan, and hua dan, can be said to have been gathered almost completely, a great collection of talents. At that time, Shu Yan's reputation was not as great as it is today. And Cheng Yanqiu had not yet warmly praised the Mei School for many days, and he was just recovering from a hoarse voice.

Now, I am submitting the program from that Feng family home performance to the Performing Arts World to be printed below. The old actors in the program, such as Tian Guifeng, Sun Juxian, Gou Yunfu, Chen Delin, Qiu Guixian, Liu Hongsheng, Yang Xiaolou, Li Shoushan, Qian Jinfu, Wang Changlin, Yu Zutong, etc., have mostly become historical figures. It is really not easy to gather such a grand home performance again in the present. We can only let the pigtail master and the dog meat general enjoy it!

The calligraphy on this program is strong, graceful, neat, and meticulous. It was originally written by the great poet and celebrity Mr. Luo Yinggong. (The original is currently stored in Mr. Mei's Zhu Yuxuan.) Mr. Luo's tomb is already overgrown with trees, so this program is even more precious and cherished.

### Gloria Stuart's Whereabouts After Arriving in Shanghai

— Xinying

Feels Unusually Interesting About This "Paris of the East"

The news about Hollywood movie star Gloria Stuart and her husband Joseph Scheckman arriving in Shanghai has already been published in this publication. What is said here is about their whereabouts on the day of their arrival in Shanghai.

After arriving in Shanghai, Gloria Stuart was particularly interested in everything about Shanghai, this Paris of the East. And in recent days, she has been quite busy shopping in various stores and attending receptions from all walks of life.

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, she can be considered the second famous Hollywood actress to come to Shanghai. (The first was Jenifer Torrens who passed through last month). According to her conversation with reporters on the day of her arrival in Shanghai, she will stay in Shanghai for a week this time.

It is said that the new film "Winner Take All" starring Gloria Stuart, produced by 20th Century Fox, will be released in this city at the end of the month, and another new film of hers, "It Could Happen to You," was written by her husband Scheckman. She had just finished filming it before leaving Hollywood, and it will also be released in this city at the end of July.

However, it is a pity that she and her husband will only stay in Shanghai for a week and will not be able to witness the grand occasion of her starring films being released in Shanghai! After leaving Shanghai, the two of them will travel to Hong Kong, Indochina, and the East Indies, and then return to the United States via Europe to complete their attempt to travel around the world.

### Gao Zhanfei and Bai Yang Have Not Yet Arrived in Hong Kong

— Yusheng

But There Is Indeed News of Their Return to Shanghai in the Short Term

There are rumors outside that Gao Zhanfei and Bai Yang have arrived in Hong Kong together and have been surrounded by various film companies in Hong Kong. Yesterday, after reporters inquired from various sources, it was proven that Gao Zhanfei and Bai Yang are still staying in Sichuan, but there is indeed news that they will leave for Shanghai in the short term. It would be too early to say that they have already arrived in Hong Kong.

Last year, a representative from Xinhua Film Company was in Chongqing and specially contacted Bai Yang, inviting Bai Yang to join Xinhua to make movies after returning to Shanghai in the future. Bai Yang accepted this request. With a prior agreement in place, Bai Yang's return to Shanghai will be a boost to Xinhua.

As for Gao Zhanfei, he used to star in "The Great Pirate of the Yellow Sea" for Xinhua. Now that he and Bai Yang are traveling together, if Bai Yang joins Xinhua, Lao Gao will of course "follow in."

What is worrying is the question of Gao Qianping. In the past, everyone called them "Lao Gao and Xiao Gao" together. Now that Lao Gao and Bai Yang are about to arrive in Shanghai, I wonder what attitude Gao Qianping will show?

### The Extraordinary Woman of the Silver Screen: Anecdotes of Joan Crawford

— Feng Xiang

Her Boyfriend's Arms Often Serve as a Temporary Cradle; Her Divorced Husband Remains Inextricably Linked

Miss Joan Crawford, renowned in the film world, loathes sleep more than anything in life. She rarely occupies her bed at night, because the kind of "spirited" nightlife in Hollywood is too alluring to let go of. However, sleep is a physiological necessity for the body to replenish its energy and recover from fatigue, which no one can avoid. Therefore, Miss Crawford has developed another habit in this environment: whether at social gatherings or on the film set, she can take a nap anytime, anywhere, and her boyfriend's arms often serve as her temporary cradle.

Recently, Miss Crawford arrived in New York from Hollywood with her beloved pug. The first thing she did upon arriving in New York was to meet with Franchot Tone, her ex-husband from whom she had divorced years ago, at a nightclub for a memorial dinner. As the band played melodious songs, the question arose whether this divorce was a "breakdown or termination of love." In any case, this kind of "unsevered lotus root" anecdote can only be performed by this extraordinary woman of the silver screen.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden (Opera World)

— Xu Muyun

It's a Pity that Sun Yukun and Hou Xirui Have Fallen So Low

Later, even his few assistants gradually scattered. For a Wusheng (male martial role) performer, without capable assistants and having to find new partners temporarily, there will never be a brilliant performance. Currently, there is a great lack of talent in Wusheng roles. Sheng Chun and Sheng Bin are still too immature. Yukun does resemble Yu Yang somewhat. If he can reinvigorate himself and come to the South to perform, I think everyone who misses Xiao Lou will praise him.

Hou Xirui was a top student in the first class of the Fu Liancheng Opera School. Not only was he one of the best students in the "Xi" class, but he was also on par with Shouchen in the Jing (painted-face male) roles in Tianjin and Beijing. When Cheng Yanqiu was just emerging, he enjoyed great fame with "The Legend of Hong Fu." The role of Qiu Ran Ke (Bearded Man) in the play was played by Xirui. His martial arts skills were excellent, surpassing Shao Shan and Shouchen. At the same time, his singing was also very steady and flavorful, so his portrayal of Qiu Ran Ke was very fitting. Yanqiu himself also felt that the play could not achieve a mutually enhancing effect without Xirui in the role. Last year, I met Yanqiu at a gathering with old friend Jiang Zicheng, with Miao Xiang and Shao Lou also present. I asked why he didn't perform "The Legend of Hong Fu" this time coming south. He replied that there was no one who could play Qiu Ran Ke. I then asked about Jiang Shao Kui. Yanqiu smiled and said, "Shao Kui is not a hero, but a robber." From this, we can see how much Yanqiu admired Xirui's art. However, Cheng, Hou, Guo (Zhongheng), Wang (Youquan), and Zhou (Ruian) have not collaborated since their breakup, so Yanqiu's play has never been performed again.

After leaving Cheng's opera troupe, Xirui's value decreased day by day. Whenever theaters in Beijing posted performances of "Fa Men Si," regardless of whether the lead was an amateur, a professional, a male actor, or a female actor, as long as they paid him a few dollars to sing, he would accept. Even if he had to rush to several theaters in a day, he didn't feel it was beneath him. At the same time, Hao Shouchen would only perform with Xiao Lou and Qing Kui for a fee of one hundred and sixty yuan or at least one hundred yuan, and he had to be paid in advance. Therefore, the value and reputation of Hao and Hou gradually differed greatly. Not only was Xirui's artistic reputation declining, but his personal life was also very depraved. In addition to being addicted to gambling and opium, he also liked to frequent third-rate opera houses when he had nothing to do, so much so that no one in the industry would pay attention to him anymore. Even if they happened to meet and walk together, they were afraid of being implicated. (3/7)

### Li Dashen Goes to Hong Kong to Await Instructions; Chen Yunshang Will Return to Shanghai in Five Weeks

— (Yindi)

The "Romance of the Western Chamber" Incident Lyrics Resolved

After completing "The Cloud Fairy," Chen Yunshang returned home in triumph and went south to Hong Kong. During her two-month stay, film companies in Hong Kong invited her to make films one after another, including Cantonese films, Mandarin films, and even English films, keeping her very busy. Originally, Chen Yunshang's position in the Hong Kong film industry was below that of Li Qinian, but now she has surpassed her and become more popular than Li Qinian.

Recently, due to rumors that the Hong Kong Cantonese film company had invited Chen Yunshang to film "Romance of the Western Chamber," Xinhua Company specially sent its distribution director, Li Dashen, to Hong Kong to prevent this. This is because Xinhua Company had commissioned Ouyang Yuqian to write the script for "Romance of the Western Chamber" half a year ago, also planning to have Chen Yunshang star in it. Secondly, Chen Yunshang has a contract with Xinhua, and she cannot film randomly without seeking the consent of her colleagues at Xinhua. These are the two reasons why Xinhua wants to prevent Chen Yunshang from filming "Romance of the Western Chamber" in Hong Kong.

Now, Li Dashen has reported back to Shanghai that the "Romance of the Western Chamber" incident is expected to be resolved (probably the Mandarin film will be stopped, and only the Cantonese film will be made). Chen Yunshang will likely stay in Hong Kong for another five weeks before returning to Shanghai again to fulfill her contract with Xinhua. Li Dashen will serve as the "minister in charge of defending the territory" and stay in Hong Kong, waiting for Chen Yunshang to finish filming her several pre-scheduled films, and then accompany her back to Shanghai.

Due to the congestion of advertisements today, the Chess Garden will be temporarily suspended for one day. (Editor)
