### After the Passing of Centenarian, Catholic Circle Deeply Mourns, Yu Bin Goes to Lang Son to Handle Funeral Arrangements and Will Hold a Solemn Mass

Chongqing, after the passing of State Councilor, Centenarian, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, people from all walks of life here are overcome with grief. Bishop Yu Bin will take a plane to Hanoi on the morning of the 7th and then take a car to Lang Son to handle the funeral arrangements on behalf of the Catholic Church and will hold a solemn mass in Lang Son. According to Bishop Yu's interview with reporters this morning, Mr. Ma's words and deeds during his lifetime were indeed a model for the generation. His great personality will be forever admired by future generations, and his academic career will also be immortal. This is known to all Chinese people, so there is no need to say more. In particular, Mr. Ma devoted himself to the Catholic Church. He was a devout Catholic during his lifetime and wanted to infuse the spirit of Jesus into our entire society so that it could be combined with our country's inherent morality, change the atmosphere, and revive our country's inherent national virtues. He devoted his life to the Catholic Church and educational and cultural undertakings. When I took office as Bishop of the Nanjing District, I immediately welcomed Mr. to Beijing and benefited greatly from his planning and assistance in religious affairs. In recent years, he has been engaged in translating the Bible, word by word, and the book has been translated. This is Mr.'s last work and is very valuable. However, the original manuscript is still in the occupied area, and it has now been decided to find a way to retrieve it and publish it so that it can be published and distributed as soon as possible. Mr. stated that he had two great aspirations in his life: first, to hope that the Catholic Church would be expanded and that the number of bishops of Chinese nationality would increase day by day; second, to hope that our country's war of resistance could win the final victory. Today, our country already has more than 20 bishops of Chinese nationality. Mr.'s first wish can be said to have been achieved. It is a pity that heaven cannot give Mr. more time to witness our country's war of resistance for justice, humanity, independence, and survival win the final victory, and he died with his ambition. I dare to believe that our 3.5 million Catholics will be able to fulfill Mr.'s will and comfort his spirit in heaven. Now that Mr. has suddenly passed away, the National Government will surely have a clear decree to praise him, and Mr.'s students are all over the world, and after mourning, they will never forget Mr.'s virtue. As for our Catholic Church, we will also hold a grand mass to mourn Mr. After I finish handling the funeral arrangements in Lang Son, I will come to Chongqing to hold a mass for Mr. Bishop Yu spoke with great sorrow during the interview. According to Mr. Ma's position in the Catholic Church, he was a priest, actually a high-ranking clergyman in Bishop Yu's jurisdiction. However, Bishop Yu respected him very much and often went to meet and consult him in Beijing. (6th Dispatch)

### Chongqing's Population Increases Again

Chongqing, the population of Chongqing, which had been dispersed after the large-scale bombing by Japanese planes in May, has gradually increased again. It increased to 350,000 in September and to 470,000 in October. However, compared with the time before the large-scale bombing in May, it is still not as good by far, because at that time Chongqing had a population of 800,000. The official here originally planned to reduce the city's population to 120,000, but the suburbs do not have sufficient housing, so the people still have to return to city life. It is heard that those who return to live here from the countryside must obtain a permit from the garrison headquarters. (6th US Associated Press Dispatch)

### Stockpiled German Goods at Haiphong Awaiting Shipment to China

Chongqing, the value of German goods purchased by the Chinese side and stockpiled at Haiphong awaiting shipment to the Chinese mainland is as high as 90 million yuan. It is heard that these goods have recently been transported to the border of Annam. After this batch of German goods is transported into China, there will be no more German goods transported into Haiphong. One reason is that the French in Annam will no longer allow German goods to be imported, and the second is due to the internal restrictions of Germany itself. Therefore, during the continuation of the European war, German goods cannot be imported into China. According to a French official in charge speaking to the Associated Press reporter, rumors that the Annam border has very strict transportation restrictions do not correspond with the facts. Special restrictions were only implemented for one week after the outbreak of the European war. Since then, everything except German goods has been allowed to pass. Even in the case of German goods, those that have already been paid for by the Chinese government or merchants are regarded as the property of the Chinese and are allowed to pass. Only goods for which the payment has not yet been made are regarded as German goods and confiscated by the French authorities in Annam. This action is not surprising because France is currently at war with Germany. (6th US Associated Press Dispatch)

### Brief Reports from Northern Jiangsu

Now they have started the so-called "third phase of sweeping", with Kitagawa, who has rich combat experience, as the commander, and they dispatch troops in four routes every day, with a turbulent situation. On the 16th, more than 100 Japanese soldiers, three cars, and two cannons invaded the sixth district of Xudong Tongshan. They encountered the Chinese army and a fierce battle broke out. After holding out for four hours, the Chinese army dispatched another unit to attack the Japanese army's flank, causing the Japanese formation to be thrown into disarray and flee. In this battle, six Japanese soldiers were killed and four were wounded. Also on the 15th, the Japanese army drove several military trains from Xuzhou to the east, carrying more than 2,000 Japanese and puppet troops, as well as four heavy cannons and two armored vehicles, and arrived at the Grand Canal station.

At 11:00 AM on the 24th, more than 100 Japanese soldiers from the ship, carrying two cannons and several machine guns, went to the Jieshou River embankment and forcibly landed, firing 20 shots into Jieshou Street. Then they advanced forward. The Chinese guards then fired at them from their strongholds. At the same time, another unit attacked the Japanese army's flank. Seeing that the Chinese army was prepared, the Japanese army retreated to the original ship. At 6:00 PM that night, the Japanese army again used four or five speedboats to attack the Chinese army's position, and a fierce battle broke out. The Chinese army used machine guns to strafe, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army still did not dare to land. After holding out for three hours, they fled back to the speedboats and escaped back into the lake. On the morning of the 25th, there was no trace of the Japanese army on the Jieshou River embankment. The Chinese side is actively destroying the highway leading into the area, but a small Japanese warship and seven or eight speedboats are still moored on the lake, and four Japanese seaplanes are parked on the water.

Editorial

### America's New Neutrality Law and the Far East

The new American Neutrality Act, passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, has already been signed by President Roosevelt, immediately taking effect and becoming American law. This demonstrates President Roosevelt's ongoing struggle against isolationists within his country, achieving the goal of amending the neutrality law. Regardless of whether this success is due to the American public's sympathy for democratic nations, thus abolishing the arms embargo clause and granting Britain and France the convenience of purchasing from America, or whether it is due to the American public's concerns that the sinking of the Athenia, with American passengers aboard, and the capture of the City of Flint, an American merchant ship, could drag America into the war, the new neutrality law empowers the American President to prohibit American ships and citizens from entering war zones. The passage of this new neutrality law proves that Roosevelt's policies have gained widespread support from the American people, and that the President's power is sufficient to control both houses of Congress. At a time when the prestige of the American executive leader is increasing daily, China naturally hopes that America will take action in the Pacific, as General Bai Chongxi said, "not only paying lip service to the Nine-Power Treaty's Open Door Policy, but also further suspending the sale of military raw materials to Japan." This is because such a move would be most beneficial to China, but this cannot be sought in the new Neutrality Act. Although the passage of the new Neutrality Act facilitates the purchase of munitions by democratic nations, its scope of application is limited to Europe and does not apply to the Far East. However, a large-scale war has been going on in the Far East for two years and three months. Although this war is undeclared, it has its importance and its particularity. China's war of resistance is a war against aggression; at the same time, China is a country with a backward heavy industry. In terms of the supply of military needs and the addition of weapons, it needs the assistance of countries that sympathize with China's war of resistance. As far as the United States is concerned, although it is inconvenient to show favoritism towards any particular country, in terms of morality, the United States has an obligation to uphold fairness, resist injustice, and protect the invaded against the invader. The abolition of the arms embargo clause allows democratic countries such as Britain and France, which possess naval superiority and a large number of merchant ships, to use cash to purchase large quantities of important weapons of war from the United States. In principle, the United States is impartial to all belligerent countries in Europe; however, in spirit, it is invisibly assisting democratic countries of the same political system and giving a major blow to fascist aggressor countries. Therefore, the abolition of the arms embargo clause and the implementation of the so-called cash-and-carry policy, we can confidently say, is absolutely beneficial to the democratic countries of Western Europe. But in the Far East, the situation is exactly the opposite. China needs to import munitions from overseas, as mentioned above. However, China's navy and merchant ships are virtually non-existent. As a result, Japan can purchase weapons from the United States and transport them itself, facilitating its invasion of China, while China has no way to purchase and transport munitions. Although the new neutrality law allows us to understand that the original intention of amending the neutrality law was not to facilitate the aggressor countries in the Far East and strike a blow to China's war of resistance, it is not enough for the United States to have this passive "no malice" towards the Far East and towards China. There must be more active actions to display the spirit of American justice.

Perhaps the policy adopted by the current President Roosevelt is the same as that of the late President Theodore Roosevelt: the action is slow, but the "big stick" is held in hand. The expansion of the great navy, the fortification of Hawaii, the Aleutian Islands, and the establishment of air force bases on the Pacific islands of Panama, all kinds of military offensive establishments, are accompanied by diplomatic offensives; such as repeatedly reiterating the Open Door Policy in the past, and more recently, the talks by its diplomatic envoys to safeguard interests in China, and the current memorandum from the US Ambassador to Japan to Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura, expressing extreme resentment at Japan's economic exclusionism and damage to American interests. It is widely rumored that the United States will implement economic sanctions against Japan. Although this rumor has been denied by the authorities, the United States, in order to safeguard its traditional interests in China and restore world peace, merely expresses and acts diplomatically. It is probably insufficient to contain the madness of aggression; only the implementation of economic sanctions is a truly effective method. We deeply know that the United States has various internal reasons that make its actions have to be slow; and we also deeply know that the United States must follow sequential measures until it implements its Far East policy of containing aggression; therefore, although we hope that the United States will adopt effective methods, we are not eager and impatient. When the water flows, the channel will be formed, and there will be a day for it, and we also deeply know that the day is not far away. As for the present, however, it is believed that after the United States amends the Neutrality Act, and when the Far East has not been recognized as a state of war, it should make full use of the leeway left by the new Neutrality Act, and supply China with munitions loaded on American merchant ships. A large amount of munitions has a great use, and a small amount of munitions also has a small use; however, its significance is not in the amount, but in symbolizing the determination of the United States to implement its Far East policy.

### American Foreign Affairs Association Advocates Economic Pressure on Japan; Commercial Treaty Abolition Allows Free Action; This Can Promote Resolution of the Far East Problem

Washington - The American Foreign Affairs Association issued a special article today, stating that since the outbreak of the European War, the United States can exert pressure on Japan to force it to submit, because the United States is now in a pivotal position. As for the negotiations currently being conducted by Ambassador Grew in Tokyo, the focus of the issue is whether the United States has the determination to insist on resolving major issues (including Japan's expansion into the Asian continent). Currently, there are only two ways to resolve the Far East problem: (1) restore China's territorial integrity and the "Open Door Policy;" (2) the interests of Western countries are bound by Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia." If the first method is followed, there is hope for a solution to the Sino-Japanese hostility, and it can achieve considerable stability. If the second method is followed, this hostility will be prolonged indefinitely. In order to continue the war of resistance, China will completely lean towards the Soviet Union. As for the interests of Western countries in the Japanese-occupied areas, they will be at the mercy of Japan. The article also talked about the possibility of American economic retaliation against Japan. Since the United States abolished the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, it has made the United States unconstrained and can use severe economic retaliation to protect American interests.

### Japan Sends Kato to Shanghai to Return American Merchant's Tung Oil

Tokyo - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Japanese special envoy Kato will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and will negotiate with American Consul General Gauss and other third-country officials. (United Press, 6th)

### Soviet Ambassador to Japan Arrives in Tokyo Yesterday to Take Office

Tokyo - Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin arrived in Tokyo today with his family and counselors. He avoided seeing reporters and went to the Soviet Embassy in Azabu District. (Domei, 6th)

Tokyo - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly denied today that Ambassador Grew had threatened Foreign Minister Nomura with the United States imposing economic pressure during their meeting last Saturday. The Washington dispatches carried in this morning's newspapers included a formal statement issued by the US State Department, which strongly denied the Tokyo report that the US Ambassador had threatened economic pressure. The US State Department's statement stated that Tokyo reported that US Ambassador Grew had told Foreign Minister Nomura that if Japan continued its current plans in China, it would be at risk of being subjected to American economic pressure. This court had received a telegram from Ambassador Grew stating that it had made this kind of economic sanction threat. The spokesman continued, saying that there was nothing to add to the statement issued last Saturday. Foreign Minister Nomura's request for a meeting with the American Ambassador was merely to personally listen to the American Ambassador's views on the US-Japan situation. The atmosphere during the talks was extremely harmonious. Neither Foreign Minister Nomura nor Ambassador Grew made any threats. The American Ambassador repeatedly stated his personal desire to see the situation between the two countries achieve a peaceful resolution, and Foreign Minister Nomura also expressed the same. At this point, a reporter from a certain newspaper mentioned that former Foreign Minister Arita had stated to the press on Saturday that the resolution of general issues between the United States and Japan was not yet the time, but individual issues could be resolved one by one. The spokesman replied that the Japanese government did not want to conduct formal negotiations with the United States in the form of a Tokyo or Washington conference at this time. "We" hope that the "New Central Government" of China can be organized soon, and the situation in East Asia will be clarified as a result. When asked whether this "New Central Government" was a prerequisite for Japan to begin formal negotiations with third countries, the spokesman replied, "We." However, he acknowledged that the recognition of the "New Central Government" would clarify the situation in several aspects. In short, the ill will of third countries towards Japan mostly arose from the large-scale war being waged in China. Therefore, when the abnormal situation is clarified and the large-scale war ends, everything will be completely changed. (Reuters, 6th)

### Japanese Statement: Preparing to Negotiate with the Soviet Union; Says US Ambassador Did Not Mention Economic Sanctions When Meeting with Foreign Minister Nomura

Tokyo - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the Japanese government is preparing to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve outstanding issues such as negotiation of the commercial treaty. Japan and Manchuria have now appointed representatives to meet with Soviet representatives. As for the representatives' names and the date of the start of the meeting, it is not appropriate to formally announce them at this time. (Reuters, 6th)

### Stalemate in Indian Question; Negotiations Break Down Between Governor-General and Gandhi, Etc.

London - Governor-General Linlithgow recently held negotiations in New Delhi with representatives of the All-India Congress and the All-India Muslim League in order to resolve the Indian question. These negotiations have now broken down. The India Office has just published the Governor-General's statements and correspondence with the leaders of both sides. The Governor-General's statement stated that he had frankly discussed everything with All-India Congress leaders Gandhi and Prasad, and All-India Muslim League President Jinnah, asking them to discuss the status of each province themselves in order to propose recommendations for expanding the Governor-General's Executive Council. After the discussions between the two sides, representatives of the major parties still had differing opinions on the basic issues. However, he had intended to find ways to mediate and would consult with party leaders and local princes at an appropriate time to make further efforts to see if there was any possibility of seeking unity among all parties. All-India Congress leader Prasad wrote to the Governor-General on November 3, stating that the All-India Congress could not accept the British policy implied in the Governor-General's declaration, nor could it consider subsequent steps of cooperation, unless the British government clearly declared its policy in the declaration, based on the methods proposed by the All-India Congress. Muslim League leader Jinnah also wrote to the Governor-General, stating that he had met with All-India Congress leaders to discuss with them. They then declared that if the British government did not approve the demands contained in the resolutions of the All-India Congress Committee, they could not discuss the Governor-General's statement on the central and provincial regimes. Thus, these two issues could not be discussed further. (Reuters, 6th)

### Glimmer of Hope in Soviet-Finnish Negotiations; Finnish Government Drafting New Instructions; Content of Soviet Union's Latest Demands Reduced Compared to Before

Finnish Capital - Regarding the current negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the negotiations are proceeding normally, but progress is quite slow. The government is currently drafting new instructions, which must be submitted to the Cabinet for approval after receiving a telegram report from the delegation from Moscow, and then issued. The date will be after the 7th of this month. In addition, political figures are holding a calm attitude towards the situation between Finland and the Soviet Union and are quietly waiting for the outcome of the negotiations. (Havas, 5th)

Danish Capital - Regarding the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland, the Moscow correspondent of the local political newspaper recently telegraphed that the Finnish delegation has telegraphed the latest demands made by the Soviet Union to its own government, and that the content has been reduced compared to what was proposed before. According to foreign observers, Soviet newspapers have stopped attacking Finland, which is a good sign. (Havas, 6th)

Swiss Capital - Regarding the ongoing negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, local newspapers said that although the representatives of both sides did not continue negotiations today, judging from the phenomena, there is a possibility of reaching a compromise. A glimmer of hope has already been revealed, and the pessimistic psychology of the Scandinavian Peninsula countries can gradually be eliminated as a result. According to this compromise, the Soviet Union will reportedly set up a naval base on the small island of Suursaari south of Hogland, as the "Gibraltar of the Baltic Sea," but will not set up a base on the mainland of Finland or on the island of Hanko. At the same time, the islands of Suursaari will still belong to Finland. However, there is also a difficulty, that is, the small island of Suursaari is close to the coast of Sweden, and if it is ceded to the Soviet Union, the Swedish government will not be happy to hear about it. In addition, the terrain of the small island is dangerous, enough to control the throat of the islands of Suursaari and the island of Hanko, and this layer is also very important. In addition, the Rybachy Peninsula in northern Finland will reportedly be ceded to the Soviet Union, along with the port of Petsamo (on the coast of the Arctic Ocean), and the Soviet Union will exchange it for the Karelian Isthmus. It is generally believed that if the port of Petsamo belongs to the Soviet Union, the naval bases of the country on the White Sea, allowing it to be the port of Murmansk, can be absolutely stable. On the Finnish side, the last thoroughfare for overseas traffic will be cut off as a result, because the country's shipping line in the Baltic Sea was originally controlled by the German Navy, and at this time, it is only safe to take the route through the port of Petsamo. (Havas, 5th)

Swedish Capital - According to the Moscow news reported by "Aftonbladet," the Soviet Union and Finland are expected to reach an understanding, but Finnish capital news is that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations will take at least one week. However, all reports said that the Soviet Union has rejected the Finnish proposal, which rejected the Soviet Union's demand to occupy the island of Hanko. It is said that the Finnish government is busy drafting new instructions to be handed over to the Finnish delegation in Moscow. If Prime Minister Cajander, Foreign Minister Erkko, and the three army representatives can agree on the new proposals to the Soviet Union today, a full cabinet meeting will be convened immediately. The Finnish instructions will be telegraphed to the Finnish delegation at night so that they can respond to the Soviet government before the October Revolution holiday. It is said that this instruction focuses on the issue of the island of Hanko. People in Helsinki believe that the Finnish government will give in and prepare to compromise with the Soviet Union. (Haitong, 5th)

Finnish Capital - Foreign Minister Molotov will host a banquet for the diplomatic corps on the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. The Finnish representatives have also received Mr. Molotov's invitation and are scheduled to attend the Red Army parade tomorrow. Regarding the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, according to people in the Finnish government, the progress is extremely slow, but Soviet newspapers have now stopped publishing anti-Finnish remarks. People here are very satisfied with this. (Haitong, 6th)

Helsinki - The Finnish Cabinet convened yesterday to discuss the content of the new instructions to be sent to the Finnish delegation in Moscow. Officials here are extremely tight-lipped. According to official sources here, although Soviet-Finnish relations are tense, there is still a possibility of continued negotiations. (United Press, 6th)

Finnish Capital - According to well-informed sources here, the content of the new Finnish government instructions is again a concession to Soviet demands. The Finnish government has expressed concessions in the Karelia area and is willing to survey new boundaries, but is unwilling to make any concessions on the Hanko issue. (Haitong, 6th)

### Soviet Union Plans to Request the Repatriation of Russians in Lithuania

Moscow - It is heard that the Soviet government plans to propose a suggestion to Lithuania, with reference to the German method of withdrawing Germans from various places, to repatriate the 170,000 Russians in the country, of which the largest number are in the Svencionys area. However, Lithuania is not rich, and if it accepts this suggestion, it will inevitably make great sacrifices, because the Russians who recently left Vilnius have taken all their belongings with them. By analogy, all Russians will take all their belongings with them when they leave the country in the future, which is not what Lithuania wants to hear. (Havas, 5th)

### Britain and the Soviet Union Conduct Economic Negotiations, Listing a List of Goods

London - Regarding the economic negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain has listed a list of various major products that can be ordered from the Soviet Union. It is expected that the Soviet government will submit an answer this week and will also list the types of goods that the country can order from Britain. Regarding this, what the British commercial authorities are eager to prevent is that the Soviet Union will resell various raw materials to Germany after purchasing them from Britain. For this reason, the goods that can be promised to be sold to the Soviet Union must be those that the Soviet Union itself urgently needs and cannot be resold to Germany, or those that Germany already has and does not need to be supplied by the Soviet Union, so as to avoid aiding the enemy. As for the economic assistance that the Soviet Union can give to Germany, its scope must be very limited, because the items that Germany urgently needs, such as oil, are also needed by the Soviet Union itself and are difficult to export in large quantities. The only thing that best meets the supply and demand between the Soviet Union and Germany is manganese produced by the Soviet Union. However, this metal product is quite bulky, and under the current circumstances, transportation is not easy. In addition, the issue of payment is also a difficult problem for Germany. The country plans to pay for the goods with various machines, and even send technicians and mechanics to the Soviet Union to help it start or develop certain industries as a reward. In Britain, the purchase of goods from the Soviet Union can be paid in cash. It is clear that the Soviet Union will not be attracted by this benefit, as can be seen from the situation of the economic negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. (Havas, 5th)

### German Ship "Bremen" Docked in the Soviet Union

Bergen, Norway - According to news obtained by a United Press reporter from sailors on the American ship "City of Flint," the magnificent German cruise ship "Bremen" is currently docked in the Soviet port of Murmansk, but its hull is painted gray. When the European War broke out, the German cruise ship "Bremen" happened to be in New York. After leaving New York, the British Navy searched for it in many ways, but unexpectedly it escaped to the Soviet Arctic port. It is heard that there are many ships docked in the port. (United Press, 6th)

### Finland Plans to Purchase Munitions from the United States

Helsinki - Although no comments have been published here on the passage of the new Neutrality Act by the United States, all parties welcome it very much. It is heard that the Finnish government and private individuals have one million US dollars in cash in the United States, which can be used to purchase munitions needed by Finland in the future. (United Press, 7th)

### Several German Aircraft Fly Over Belgium; Belgian Government Lodges Protest

Belgian Capital - The authorities recently announced that several German aircraft flew into the country's airspace yesterday. The government authorities have instructed the ambassador to Germany to lodge a strong protest with the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Havas, 6th)

Paris - Three German reconnaissance planes flew over the city of Tourcoing in northern France yesterday. The local air defense forces immediately issued an alert, and the anti-aircraft artillery fired. The German planes then returned to the country via the Belgian border. It is not unusual for German aircraft to violate Belgian neutrality. Compared with the fact that British and French aircraft avoid flying into the airspace of neutral countries, it is not the same. In addition, reconnaissance planes from both sides were slightly active yesterday. At night, the German army attacked the French advanced troops and were repelled. Apart from this, everything else was calm and uneventful. (Havas, 6th)

### The Flint City Case: Norway Rejects German Protest, States Release Was According to International Law

Oslo: Regarding the case of the American cargo ship "Flint City," after Germany protested to Norway yesterday, the Norwegian government has already responded to the German Chargé d'Affaires, rejecting the protest. The contents of the response have not yet been published, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement explaining that the Norwegian government's measures were taken entirely in accordance with international law. It stated: "The American cargo ship 'Flint City' arrived at Tromsø Island in our country on the 20th of last month. At that time, we only allowed it to dock for 24 hours, and the ship sailed to Murmansk, Soviet Union, on the decided day. Regarding this matter, our government exchanged official letters with the German Chargé d'Affaires. The German side believes that captured ships can sail in neutral waters, as long as they do not dock in neutral ports, and there is no time limit. Our country also expressed agreement with this view. On the 30th of last month, the ship returned to Tromsø Island without stopping. In order to avoid accidents, we sent a warship to escort it within our territorial waters. When the ship sailed south of Bergen Harbor, it stopped. The shipowner (a German military officer) reported that a crew member was ill and requested to dock at Hog Bay for medical treatment. Our warship immediately sent a medical officer on board. It was claimed that the crew member only had a minor injury to his leg. Our warship ordered the 'Flint City' not to anchor in Hog Bay, but the ship did not comply. When questioned, the German shipowner claimed, 'It is under the orders of the German government' to consult with the German consul. Article 13 of the 1907 Hague Convention stipulates that if a ship captured by a belligerent nation anchors in a neutral port not due to weather conditions or lack of food and fuel, the neutral nation may restore its freedom. This convention was approved by both our country and Germany, and when the 'Flint City' initially decided to anchor in Tromsø Island, the German Chargé d'Affaires's view was based on this convention. Therefore, our government released the 'Flint City' and detained the German sailors on board. All of these actions are entirely in accordance with international law. Afterwards, the German Chargé d'Affaires lodged a protest with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 4th of this month, requesting that we intercept the ship, and that other issues be resolved through negotiations between the two governments. We believe that there is no legal reason to comply, and have responded to the Chargé d'Affaires explaining our views." (Havas, 5th)

Bern: The Basler Nachrichten recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that after the Norwegian government detained the German sailors from the American cargo ship "Flint City," the German Foreign Office ordered its ambassador to Norway to demand their release from the Norwegian government.

It was also said that the German escorting sailors carried sixty hand grenades, ten pistols, twenty bayonets, and one machine gun. Fortunately, the American sailors did not cause any trouble along the way and were safe. His driving direction was completely under the powerful command of the Germans. (Associated Press, 6th)

### Dutch Foreign Ministry Publishes Yellow Paper: Neutrality Repeatedly Violated, Shipping Greatly Affected

The Hague: The Dutch Foreign Ministry yesterday published a Yellow Paper, first printing the full text of the Anglo-German declarations respecting Dutch neutrality, and then detailing the repeated violations of Dutch neutrality after the outbreak of the European War, as well as the great impact of British control measures on Dutch shipping. The book discloses a letter from Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens to British Foreign Secretary Halifax, in which he expresses that the Netherlands reserves the right to protest any "contraband list" that violates international law and harms the commerce of neutral countries. At the same time, he protests the British control authorities' detention of Dutch ships in controlled ports and the prohibition of contact with common companies. The British government replied that the detention period for Dutch ships could be reduced, but goods suspected of being contraband must be kept in custody until the British authorities allow them to be delivered to the buyers.

### Mayor Max of Brussels Dies: Earned Renown in the Last Great War, A Model for Mayors Worldwide

Brussels: Sir Mayor Max of Brussels passed away here today at the age of seventy. The name "Mayor Max" will forever remain in the hearts of his friends and former enemies. During the last European War, when he served as Mayor of Brussels, his deeds of bravely resisting the enemy earned him worldwide renown, even respect from the enemy. In 1914, when the German army invaded Brussels, he organized a committee to assist refugees in the midst of the war and control the rise in food prices, ensuring that the people had no worries about food. He also hastily set up aid stations in various schools and other empty buildings, so that the injured and sick could receive treatment. When German soldiers repeatedly rioted, he personally went to persuade them with reason and quell the riots. On August 17th, he sent the treasures stored in the Brussels city treasury to Antwerp. Three days later, he drove a car with a white flag to Leuven to confer with the commander of the German vanguard, hoping to prevent the recurrence of atrocities as much as possible, because in several towns and villages passed by the German army, atrocities were committed at will. During the period of the German occupation of Brussels, he refused to sacrifice his independence to the German Governor-General, and insisted on his dignity as mayor. When the German General Karaszewski first occupied Brussels, he ordered six beds to be set up in the city hall for his staff to rest. He also set up a bed there, firmly refusing to leave the city hall. When the German army in the city issued proclamations to demoralize the people, posting them in the thoroughfares, he also issued proclamations, posting them next to them, encouraging the people, and repeatedly protesting the German infringement of the rights of Brussels citizens. He firmly refused to shake hands with the German general. On one occasion, a German soldier threatened to put him to death because he maintained the circulation of grain coupons. He reported this to the officer in charge and had the soldier punished. Not long after, the German General Karaszewski was transferred elsewhere. On the verge of leaving, he told him that it was a pity that he had not known him before the war and become friends, as he would have been proud to do so. After Karaszewski left, he was replaced by General Lüttwitz, who ordered that all Belgian flags be taken down. He then issued an article, announcing to the public, denouncing this as an unjust act, but submitting to force to avoid bloodshed. At the end of his article, he said, "Let us endure and wait for the day of revenge." The German general was angry and wanted to arrest him, but did not do so. However, his freedom was not maintained for long. Because the Brussels City Hall had issued bonds of 20 million francs to purchase grain, and the German Governor-General violated the promise and prohibited the distribution of rations, intending to levy an additional tax of 30 million francs, he notified the banks that the City Hall would no longer guarantee these bonds. As a result, he was arrested on September 24, 1914, and initially detained in Namur, then repeatedly transferred to other places, and even went to Berlin. On November 13, 1918, he escaped from Goslar with a false passport. Two days later, he safely arrived in Brussels, and on November 16th, he was warmly welcomed by the public. He was born in Brussels and graduated from the University of Brussels, receiving a doctorate in law at the age of twenty. He then engaged in journalism. In 1894, he was elected as a provincial councilor, and nine years later, he was elected as a Brussels city councilor. The following year, he was elected as Mayor of Brussels. Three weeks later was his 40th birthday. After he escaped from Germany, he was highly respected by his own country and various foreign countries. China, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and other countries presented him with honorary degrees or medals. In 1934, he was elected as a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts, because he possessed the highest virtues of an administrator and citizen, was unyielding against strong enemies, possessed the courage of a hero, and was kind, intelligent, and resourceful, a perfect combination of benevolence, wisdom, and courage. He was short in stature, with a mustache, a broad forehead, and sharp eyes. He made people feel like they had known him for a long time. Those who loved him were always loved by him, so he was always respected wherever he went. He strove to be humble and did not pursue vanity. Although he had many medals, he did not wear uniforms or display them. He remained the Mayor of Brussels after the war, and continued to be highly praised for his resolute actions. Because he was responsible for maintaining order in the city streets, all parades were prohibited unless permission was obtained in advance. Once, a socialist mayor from another city came to the capital and led a delegation to a certain administrative department to discuss matters. Vehicles filled the road. Because he had not obtained permission from the city government, he ordered the police to disperse the crowd. In 1933, a major bribery case involving police officers occurred. The police chiefs of Brussels and Leuven were both implicated. He took over the police affairs of both places until the entire case was cleared. Almost all clubs and public welfare organizations in Brussels elected him as president. Whenever there were major ceremonies, he personally attended them. He remained unmarried throughout his life. A thoroughfare in Brussels was named after him to commemorate him forever. Such a man is a model for mayors worldwide and should be emulated. (Reuters, 6th)

### Oslo Convention Countries Expert Meeting

### Spanish Military Observers European War: Says Germany Will Win

Rome: According to General Queipo, leader of the Spanish National Army, speaking to the Associated Press reporter here today, Germany will win the current war. "I firmly believe that within a few weeks, Germany will inflict a surprising blow on Britain and France. Germany's current air force is at least twice as large as the combined air forces of Britain and France. As for a long-term war, Germany's preparations are also more sufficient than Britain and France, because Germany's gasoline reserves are enough for three years of use. In addition, Germany also has the support of Soviet warehouses." General Queipo said that this was his personal opinion. General Queipo is currently the chief representative of the Spanish-German-Italian military observation group. On the eve of the outbreak of the European War, his party was in Germany inspecting military affairs, and has now arrived here to inspect Italian military affairs. (Associated Press, 6th)

### British Labour Leader Explains War Policy: To Free Other Countries from Dictatorial Tyranny

London: Labour leader Greenwood said in a speech last night that Britain's declaration of war was driven by the resolute will to permanently free other countries from the shackles of dictatorship. This decision will inevitably involve great sacrifices, but without this decision, the sacrifice will be human freedom. The sacrifice of life and money is the price that must be paid to eradicate the inhuman dictatorial tyranny in the world. Dictatorship is now gradually destroying the elements of Christian civilization, and Britain cannot ignore this challenge where the existence of non-freedom means the triumph of violence. As for the outcome, there is no doubt. One day when the war ends, not only we, but also Germany and other peoples will enjoy freedom. Future peace will not harbor any resentment towards the people of other countries, nor will it have territorial or political ambitions, but will be a peace worth our current sacrifices.

### British and French Naval Authorities Discuss Cooperation: Mission Accomplished

Paris: The British Embassy in France recently issued a press release stating that our Naval Minister Churchill, accompanied by the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, came here on the 2nd of this month to discuss naval cooperation between the allied nations of Britain and France for three days, and has completed his mission.

### Swedish Territorial Waters: Three Miles vs. Four Miles, Germany and Sweden Clash

Stockholm: The German government yesterday notified the Swedish government that the territorial waters of your country should be limited to three miles from the coast. The Swedish government immediately submitted a reply, reserving all rights. In addition to agreeing with this measure, the local newspapers also protested to Germany, saying that the coastline of this country is winding and tortuous, which is different from other countries. Large ships often cannot navigate within three miles of the coast. Therefore, since 1779, this country has decided that territorial waters should be limited to four miles from the coast. It is surprising that the German government now denies this old custom of 160 years. Both Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet stated that "The territorial waters of Sweden are limited to four miles from the coast. Germany originally respected this during the last European War. If this precedent is overturned, the shipping industry of Sweden will inevitably suffer a major blow, and it contradicts the guarantees provided by the German government when the war broke out, namely the guarantee from the Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, Admiral Raeder, and the Minister of Aviation, General Göring, that Germany is willing to respect the foreign trade rights of the Scandinavian countries. The actions of the German government in this regard may have a negative impact on the current commercial negotiations between Germany and Sweden." (Havas, 6th)

Berlin: According to the "National News" here today, the census of the Jewish population in Poland was completed on October 29.

(Associated Press, 6th)

### British Release Statistics on Merchant Ship Losses: 56 Ships Since the Start of the War

London: According to responsible sources released today, when the European War broke out, there were a total of 18.5 million tons of British merchant ships sailing at sea. In the nine weeks since the start of the war, 56 ships have been sunk by German submarines or by hitting mines, with a total tonnage of 238,000 tons. The losses are less than 1.5 percent, which shows the limited power of German submarines. (Reuters, 6th)

London: Officials recently declared that in the most recent week, from October 28 to November 4, only three British merchant ships were sunk, totaling 18,000 tons, which is a significant reduction compared to the 11 ships lost in the first week of the war, totaling 64,000 tons. On the other hand, the target of German submarine attacks is British merchant ships. Only six French merchant ships have been sunk, and the total number of merchant ships from neutral countries that have been sunk is only 32. This can be seen from this. (Havas, 6th)

Berlin: The talks between the German ambassador to Moscow and the German government have ended.

Foreign newspapers reported that the German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, returned to the Turkish capital from Berlin, took a short rest in the capital of Yugoslavia on the way, and took the opportunity to have political talks with Yugoslav politicians. The German authorities deny this. The foreign spokesperson stated to foreign journalists today that the Swedish newspaper reported that Germany had indicated to the Soviet Union and Finland that it was willing to mediate, and suggested to the Soviet Union that instead of establishing a military base in Hanko Harbor, it could establish a military base in Uto Island. These are all unfounded words and cannot be believed. (Haitong, 6th)

Berlin: The Berlin newspapers today attach great importance to the US government's change of policy and the repeal of the arms embargo, and say that US President and Secretary of State Hull had repeatedly stated in previous years that if the ban was lifted during wartime, neutrality would be in danger. German officials believe that the American rumor that the German government will submit a formal protest to the US government is not to be believed. (Haitong, 6th)

Fuzhou News: Since the outbreak of the war, Fujian Province has established two companies, one for trade and one for transportation, to manage the unified control of trade and transportation within the province. The export of tea, timber, paper, sugar, tung oil, etc., is all under the control of the trading company. The import of matches, cotton yarn, pigments, and hardware is also under planned control. At the same time, the Finance and Trade Committee has also established an office in the province to handle the settlement of foreign exchange from the export of local products. However, due to the evacuation of the population, coastal financial institutions and trade organizations have retreated inland. Now that the Japanese military operations have made no progress, they have changed their plans and adopted economic offensives in the occupied areas and coastal areas. The targets in Fujian are the four prefectures of Zhang (Zhangzhou), Quan (Quanzhou), Fu (Fuzhou), and Xing (Xinghua), colluding with bad elements to smuggle private goods and opium for import, and buying gold and rice for export, using Xiamen and Pingtan as bases for this economic offensive. Companies are established by Japanese and Taiwanese to handle this. Although the authorities have issued orders for strict anti-blockade measures, it is difficult to ensure thorough prevention due to the vast coastal area and numerous harbors. Therefore, there are now plans to expand financial institutions, restore trade organizations, and strengthen economic power in important coastal locations to resist the Japanese offensive. The Provincial Bank's planned establishment of Fuzhou and Quanzhou branches, and the Trading Company's organization of Minnan and Mindong companies are all for this reason, and are currently underway. Recently, the Provincial Government also received the "Outline of Measures for Purchasing Assets in Guerrilla Areas" issued by the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters of the 囗th War Zone, ordering immediate implementation to counter economic aggression. It has already instructed the Provincial Bank and sent a letter to the Fujian Office of the Trade Committee to implement it promptly.

### Japanese Planes Repeatedly Harass Northern Jiangsu, Bombing Linze, Shagou, and Caodian, Resulting in Civilian Casualties and Destruction of Houses

For days, the Japanese Air Force has been extremely active in the areas east of the Grand Canal, constantly conducting reconnaissance and bombing. The casualties among the people and the destruction of houses are countless. On the 27th, eight Japanese planes, after 10:00 AM, bombed Shagou and Linze in batches, indiscriminately. First, three Japanese planes were spotted over Linze, circling for reconnaissance before dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns. Afterwards, they flew elsewhere and soon returned to drop bombs again. In total, more than a dozen bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped, resulting in over thirty civilian casualties and the destruction of over a hundred houses. Four to five Japanese planes flew over Shagou, dropping around twenty bombs (including incendiary bombs) in four waves within two hours, resulting in two civilian casualties and the destruction of over two hundred houses. Taojialin, northwest of Shagou, was also hit by two bombs. At the same time, they constantly flew to Qin Nan Cang, Wuyou Gang, Men, Sheyang, Jiang Ying, and Dazong Lake for reconnaissance, and finally gathered at San Duo at 11:20 AM, flying towards Gaoyou via Yigou. The Xinghua air defense authorities issued an air raid alert at 10:06 AM on the 27th. Because Japanese planes flew into the territory twice and then turned back, two emergency alerts were issued, which were lifted after about an hour. After 10:00 AM on the 28th, three Japanese planes dropped three or four bombs on Taojialin and two bombs on Shagou. Wangzhigang was harassed twice, with over ten bombs dropped. In addition to the destruction of dozens of houses, there were also civilian casualties. At the same time, two to three Japanese planes flew over Huduo, Qin Nan Cang, Xi'an Feng, Jiang Ying, and Linze, circling for reconnaissance.

East of Huaibao, Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to intrude. Although Cheqiao and Caodian were once occupied, they were later recovered by Chinese troops. Recently, Japanese troops have dispatched planes to bomb continuously. On the 21st, three Japanese planes bombed Caodian, Xudian, Cuibao, and Wangjiazhuang several times, dropping over twenty bombs, killing several civilians and destroying dozens of houses. At 1:50 PM on the 29th, three Japanese planes were spotted over Caodian again, circling for reconnaissance before flying to Fenggu Village for reconnaissance and then towards Funing.

### Panic over Subsidiary Currency in Northern Jiangsu: Market Feels Extremely Illiquid

Rugao News: Recently, subsidiary currency has become extremely scarce in villages and towns in Northern Jiangsu. At the beginning of the year, the Japanese puppets greatly absorbed copper coins from the market, making small-scale transactions quite difficult. However, general transactions could still be maintained. In the past two months, small denomination banknotes have also become scarce, and there are no stamps to alleviate the situation. Therefore, the market feels illiquid. Recently, even one-yuan legal tender notes have become rare commodities. Only five-yuan legal tender notes are circulating. Often, a five-yuan note is used to buy shoes worth two yuan and fifty cents, but stores cannot provide change, so the purchase fails. Currently, the people of Northern Jiangsu are eagerly awaiting central government relief, as the local county administrations have no relief measures. The Rugao County government recently plans to issue one- and two-corner circulating notes as a remedy, but it has not yet been implemented.

### Despite Good Autumn Harvest, Wuxi Already Feels Rice Shortage: Supply Unsmooth, Procurement Difficult

Wuxi News: Wuxi is one of the four major rice markets in the country. Although it is not a rice-producing area, it is the distribution center for rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. In the past, rice came from areas such as Jin, Li, Wu, Yi, Cheng, Dan, and Ji in Southern Jiangsu, as well as Wu, Chao, Luan, Xiaoxi, Dangtu, and Caishi in Northern and Southern Anhui. Before the war, with ample financial resources and numerous warehouses, rice storage often reached two to three million shi. Even during the lean season, there were at least several hundred thousand shi in storage, so it was possible to regulate surpluses and deficits with confidence. Although fluctuations in rice prices were unavoidable, there was rarely a risk of sudden price increases or decreases, ensuring price balance and food security for the people. After the war, financial resources were exhausted and supplies dwindled, leading to the closure of warehouses. The amount of storage is less than one-tenth of what it used to be. Since the Japanese ban on transportation this summer, supplies have become even scarcer, with only a few arriving. Although there were still 300,000 shi of stored grain at that time, it has been gradually depleted with daily consumption. Recently, the storage amount is only around 10,000 to 20,000 shi. Compared to the population of Wuxi County, this amount is truly insufficient. Since the early rice harvest in Anhui Province, rice merchants have flocked to Wuhu, Dangtu, Caishi, and other places to purchase as much as possible, hoping to transport it to Wuxi and lower rice prices, ensuring food security for the people. However, the local Japanese puppet troops suddenly prohibited rice from leaving the area and notified the merchants that they must have a procurement permit from the destination to transport rice. The rice merchants returned, having spent much effort. They managed to obtain two procurement permits from the Japanese special affairs agency in Suzhou and purchased 10,000 shi of rice in Wuhu. There are still 70,000 shi of rice waiting to be transported from Dangtu, Caishi, Chao County, and other places, but the Japanese are refusing to issue permits. In this situation, how can storage be sufficient, and how can rice prices be lowered? Although the autumn harvest in various places has already begun, procurement is difficult, and traffic is blocked in Yili and other counties, cutting off supplies. Therefore, the coming rice shortage is truly unimaginable.

### War-Time European Marches (Continued)

— Special Correspondent from London, Shu Di

The realization of this most ideal situation, in the case of Poland, we can give it a name, which is: "Wealth and Honor Both."

Obviously, this is a very risky strategy! What if this assessment fails? Therefore, in response, Poland has its second strategy, which is, using a fabricated name: "Good Fortune in Misfortune."

Shortly before Hitler attacked Poland, he loudly threatened Poland: "If Poland continues like this, I am afraid that this new country of more than twenty years will write the last chapter of its history." Indeed, Hitler's most ingenious thing is "winning by short battles"; however, if he fails to win by short battles, he makes a major decision to eliminate Poland, then, apart from other international changes, in terms of military strength, everyone generally agrees that he can achieve it. In this way, for Poland, it cannot but be regarded as a temporary disaster. However, it also clearly recognized this possibility, and resolutely shouldered the cross of sacrifice, not hesitating to seek the final benefit in the greatest disaster, which is the highest plan of the Polish authorities to finally respond to the war this time.

Poland estimated that after Germany captured Danzig and the "Corridor," if it could not end the war, its second step would certainly be to attack Warsaw, attempting to make an alliance under the city. In that case, Poland prepared to finally abandon its capital and continue to fight Germany. Therefore, Poland's second and most important line of defense is east of Warsaw, along the Vistula River, the Bug River, and the San River. Roughly speaking, it starts from Augustów on the eastern edge of East Prussia, passes through Brest, passes through Deblin, and goes all the way to Krakow. Poland estimated that Germany, at most, absolutely could not cross this line if it did not want to conflict with the Soviet Union. Moreover, even on such a line, when fighting broke out, what was felt to be unsafe was not only Poland itself; in the south, there were countries such as Romania, in the east, there was the Soviet Union, and in the north, there were the Baltic countries. These countries, at that time, would naturally rise up one after another to resist Germany's advance.

Moreover, in Western Europe, it has the allied powers of Britain and France!

Of course, at that time, a great war would absolutely break out. In such a great war, Poland believes that Germany will definitely be defeated in the end. Therefore, even if Poland suffers sacrifices in the process, in the end, at a conference table where a participating country disposes of the defeated country—Germany—Poland will definitely be a major player, and when disposing of Germany's future territory, Poland can also get a little territorial benefit from Germany. At that time, Danzig's incorporation into Poland is of course not a problem; East Prussia is also of course incorporated; even, if possible, it can extend its influence into the territory of Germany proper, all the way to the areas east of the Oder River.

Assuming that the first ideal is realized, then the first-class powers of Europe in the future are Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Poland. If the second ideal is realized, then the first-class powers in the future are Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland (whether Italy is still a first-class power depends on which side it participates in). Poland's current authorities are calculating in this way.

It should be added here: the Polish authorities do not believe that Italy will always be inseparable from Germany in a great war; and if Italy also fights alongside Germany, then its fate should be the same as Germany's, and it will be defeated together.

Regarding the Soviet Union, even with the signing of the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact," Poland does not believe that it will stand idly by to the end. In any case, the assistance of armaments—at least trade—is absolutely possible. Until the eve of this great war, what it was most worried about was still Britain's attitude. Therefore, when Britain expressed its absolute fulfillment of the mutual assistance agreement to the end and announced the terms of the agreement, at this time, Poland felt that it could fight with confidence. Also, regarding the Balkan Peninsula countries, especially Romania, it believes that it absolutely cannot sit idly by and watch Poland's defeat. And, with Britain and France participating in the war, and with the Soviet Union assisting Poland, it believes that all the Balkan Peninsula countries, led by Romania and Turkey, will mostly automatically rise up and join the side of the British, French, and Polish allied forces. (If Italy helps Germany, perhaps Yugoslavia will be the only exception.) What is the strength of this group of Balkans? General estimates are about six million!

It is precisely because Poland's aspiration and determination to respond to the war are so thorough that when Britain and France declared war on Germany, the door to a German-Polish compromise, with Poland's submission as its content, was finally closed! From now on, Poland has embarked on a path of betting its national fortune on a single throw! (September 6) (The End)

### Japanese Ships Offending Guangdong Assemble Along the Leizhou Peninsula, Vainly Attempting to Invade Southern Guangdong

Hong Kong News: Recently, the Japanese troops offending Guangdong have assembled a large number of warships along the Leizhou Peninsula, and Japanese ships in the Pearl River are also heading to that area in a steady stream. As of October 26, there were more than twenty ships distributed in the area of Guantou Ridge, Longmen Port, Qisha, and Sandunsha. On the other side of the Leizhou Peninsula, in Haikou, Hainan Island, there were also sixty to seventy motorboats of various sizes. On the highway from Haikou to Qiongshan County, there were more than a thousand newly arrived Japanese troops. These Japanese troops will likely be used to invade southern Guangdong. Also, from October 22 and 23, Japanese planes and warships have been constantly shelling and bombing Hepu, Fangcheng, Beihai, and other places, secretly measuring water depths and placing buoys. Therefore, in the past week, the situation in that area has become tense. However, it cannot be predicted whether the Japanese will launch a full-scale invasion or if this is still a threat and containment tactic. However, the mountains of southern Guangdong are overlapping, and transportation is blocked. All highways have been thoroughly destroyed. Not only will the Japanese mechanized units have no place to use their forces, but even ordinary infantry carrying light weapons will have difficulty moving. Therefore, it is difficult for the Japanese army to succeed in invading that area.

### Fierce Fighting Occurs in Changzhou, Japanese Troops Call for Reinforcements from Suzhou

Suzhou News: On the 22nd of last month, all the key points in the four suburbs of Changzhou were recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in Changzhou City were greatly panicked and urgently called for reinforcements from the Guangye unit here. Upon receiving the news, the Japanese troops stationed in Suzhou immediately mobilized Japanese troops from the four counties of Xi, Cheng, Yu, and Kun to rush to Changzhou. On the 23rd and 24th, they engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in Xiaxi, Jiaze, Huangli, and Dong'an, etc., in the southwest of Changzhou. Among these places, the battle in Huangli was the fiercest. Huangli is the gateway to Changzhou, and its gain or loss is of great importance to Changzhou. Therefore, the Japanese army did its best to cope with it. In order to avoid major sacrifices, the Chinese army abandoned the plan to attack Huangli. In these battles, the Japanese army had a force of seven regiments, but as a result, the Chinese army, with its relaxed and waiting formation, gained the advantage. At the moment, the Chinese army is still reorganizing its troops in order to launch another attack on Changzhou.

### Suzhou: Installation of Gate Barriers in All Streets and Alleys, Japanese Troops Fear Attacks by Chinese Army

Suzhou News: Recently, the Chinese mobile units inside and outside the city of Suzhou have been very active. For example, the punishment of the puppet Dong Sun Zhuoren on the 25th of last month and the assassination of the puppet civil affairs official Feng Runzhen on the 27th are proof of this. Currently, the Japanese army is sincerely afraid that the Chinese mobile units will attack the urban area. Therefore, starting from the first of this month, it has forced the puppet police bureau to install strong gate barriers in the streets and alleys and strictly ordered the closure of desolate and remote alleys. In the key areas, the Japanese army and puppet police are increasing patrols and watchmen.

Also, from dawn to 2:00 PM on the 2nd, the Japanese army suddenly imposed an emergency curfew inside and outside the city and prohibited pedestrians and vehicles from passing. As for the reason for the curfew, it cannot be known as the Japanese side refused to announce it. According to general speculation, it is largely related to the recent fighting in Changzhou.

Education News

### Actively Promoting Education in Shanxi Province Amidst Hardship and Suffering: Establishing Six to Seven Hundred Elementary Schools Under Fire, Changing Elementary School to Four-Year System to Adapt to Needs

(Western Shanxi News) Although the ten counties of the Sixth Administrative District of Western Shanxi have been occupied for more than a year, they continue to promote education with all their efforts. The current situation of education in the area is recorded as follows:

School Education

The Sixth Administrative District is geographically the most remote, and transportation is very closed and inconvenient. In the past, education was not very developed. Only in the cities of Linfen and Xi County were there middle schools. Recently, the Sixth District established six district-run middle schools in this area, divided into senior and junior levels. These are currently the highest institutions of learning in Western Shanxi, with a total of about 300 students. They have already started classes on November 1 last year. In addition, a branch school has been established near the Hexi (Fen) Dong office of the Sixth District, educating the youth of the counties in Hedong. A branch school is also being prepared for opening in a certain place in Fenxi, planning to train technical talents to develop the national defense industry. The main focus is still on elementary school education. On average, each district in each county has a two-level elementary school, and there are three to four primary elementary schools in each village. There are currently 600 to 700 elementary schools established under fire in the entire district, and they are still increasing. Compared to some educationally developed places, this number is still very small, because the Sixth District has a total of ten counties. But it must be known that this is a region where cultural education is extremely backward, and today it is in particularly difficult conditions. The Sixth District includes these ten counties: Linfen, Hongtong, Zhao City, Huo County, Lingshi, Fenxi, Xi County, Pu County, Yonghe, and Da Ning. Compared to the five counties along the Tongpu Railway in the front, the results are the best. This is partly because the original cultural level here was relatively high, and there were originally more schools than in other places. In addition to the mandatory Three Principles of the People, the curriculum for elementary schools at all levels mainly includes three types: national language textbooks, arithmetic textbooks, and general knowledge textbooks. In addition, there are also air defense and poison defense knowledge, military training, singing, and other courses, and singing national salvation songs takes up a lot of time. The textbooks are mostly adapted to local conditions and re-edited uniformly. Some are lithographed, and some are mimeographed. Because of the difficulty of printing, education in various places has not yet been completely unified. Now, the Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office of the Sixth District is stepping up the lithographic printing of large quantities. The reason for separately editing and printing textbooks here is that, on the one hand, the textbooks edited and printed in other places are not suitable for the current specific situation and needs, and on the other hand, the postal restrictions in the war zone prevent large-scale transportation from the rear. According to the special environment and actual situation of the district, the form of the war of resistance and the needs, they have temporarily changed the elementary school years to a total of four years: two years for junior elementary and two years for senior elementary. But there is a time when, if work requires it and the students' grades are particularly good, they can also be introduced to national salvation work at any time, or promoted to middle school in advance. Those with poor grades can also reduce their study time.

Several Characteristics

The new education implemented here has several characteristics. First, all textbooks are closely linked to today's work of resisting the war and building the country, creating content for resisting the war and building the country. Even arithmetic teaches elementary school students about the number of foreign horses, airplanes, and cannons, strengthening children's national consciousness. Second, the school authorities do not give students any unreasonable restrictions, do not prohibit students from engaging in various activities that are beneficial to resisting the war, and also lead students in various national salvation and other activities, establishing a democratic and autonomous style. Third, the past system of corporal punishment for students is abolished, eliminating unreasonable discipline and eliminating the past barriers, hatred, and fear that students had for teachers. Teachers and students live together as one. Fourth, adapting to the particularly difficult environment during the war of resistance and national construction, the style of enduring hardship and hard work is established. Teachers do not have good classrooms and desks and chairs, and sometimes lectures are given in the fields or underground. Fifth, they fully promote the spirit of collective learning. Students who study well still automatically lead a collective life after class, organizing small groups, lectures, singing teams, etc. Sixth, linking learning with practice, most elementary school students organize propaganda teams, etc., to work in the countryside after studying, or help the village self-defense team stand guard, patrol, check pedestrians, and other activities. Seventh, in general, the scouting training in schools is changed to more rigorous military training, which is also an important feature of this children's education.

Social Education

Especially since the time when the restoration of governments at all levels began, the training of cadres has also become a very important education work. These trainings are mostly short-term. The most cadres training classes are held by governments at all levels, and the nature is also divided into many types such as administration, education, village heads, neighborhood heads, and village self-defense teams. This is the main purpose of planting training, which is to cultivate and select new cadres, transform backward or fragile cadres, and unify cadres' political understanding and new working style. The work of social education is developing relatively slowly, but everyone has already paid great attention to this work. In general, it is promoted through people's schools, literacy classes, and small organizations of mass groups, and supplemented by public performances of dramas and songs.

### Advancing Vocational Library Has Opened

The Advancing Vocational Supplementary School at 486 Nanjing Road has 1,800 students this semester, is well-managed, and has a good reputation. In order to promote supplementary education, it has also jointly organized the Advancing Vocational Circulating Library with the China Library Service Society, and held an opening ceremony on the 5th. More than 100 people, including Ding Fubao, Huang Jingwan, Yu Youxin, Xu Wancheng, Chen Jinxian, Chen Yisheng, and Zhou Zhide, attended. The ceremony was led by Principal Lu Jun Qian. Chen Hongfei, Chairman of the China Library Service Society, and Yang Changzhi, manager of the society, reported on the preparation process. Finally, guests made speeches, and tea and refreshments were served before dispersing.

### School News

First and Second Orphan Schools: The Yanping Road Second Refugee Shelter of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, which shelters more than 5,000 refugees, has recently been converted into a self-sufficiency center, and the refugees' lives are entirely self-sufficient. Therefore, starting from this month, the Yanping Road First Orphan School will be closed. In addition to reassigning some teachers, the rest will be given severance pay. Furthermore, since this summer, the Dunchin Road First Refugee Shelter has been managed by the Salvation Army, and the results have been remarkable. It is said that the First Orphan School attached to the shelter will also be taken over by the Salvation Army after Christmas, and the principal will be concurrently held by the director of the shelter in order to unify management and save public funds.

Seventh China Vocational School: The teachers of all subjects at the Seventh China Vocational Supplementary School attached to the China Vocational Education Society are all experienced people. Ms. Yu Yi Zeng is in charge of the Russian language course. The other day, a Russian named Cha Yifan came to the school to preside over the Russian language. The students were able to converse fluently with him individually.

Sanji Electric School: The morning class of the telecommunications engineering department of the Sanji Radio School, which was recently newly recruited, is already full, and formal classes have already started yesterday. However, in view of the large number of students from other places who are requesting to enroll, and at the same time, those in the local amateur community who are interested in studying telecommunications are requesting to add classes, it has been decided to add another evening class in the telecommunications department next month, graduating in five months, and boarding is available. The regulations can be obtained from the school at 160 Tianjin Road.

### Handicap Basketball Tournament: Xufang Wins the Championship; Xianle Loses 26-51 Without the Handicap

The first handicap basketball tournament ended the day before yesterday. After Flying Eagles defeated Nanyang 59-36 (without handicap), the audience had already packed the small court. They eagerly awaited the final between Xufang and Xianle. Both sides fielded their best lineups. As a result, Xufang defeated Xianle 51-26 and won the championship. The key to the victory was the "handicap" in name only. After all, Xufang is a first division team. Their guarding, passing, and shooting were all better than Xianle's. Although Xianle lost, their sportsmanship was fully demonstrated. The performances of both sides were highly praised by the fans. Zou Ziren of Xufang and Chen Wenkui, Li Guang, and Hu Xianying of Xianle wasted too many opportunities, which was also a reason for Xianle's defeat. Xufang's movements changed from slow to fast, and their passing was rarely "leaked," which was commendable. If the team still has these six players join the Sino-Western Youth League, they can beat Hualian Baimen.

### Finance: Intense Competition Between Bulls and Bears in Foreign Exchange; Speculative Selling...Almost Approaching the Exchange Settlement Price; Bank of Japan's Settlement Inflow...More Tight Than Before After Squeezing

Foreign exchange rates yesterday, as announced by HSBC, saw British gold rise by half a pence, reaching five pence, and the US dollar rose by 8.125, reaching 8.25 yuan. Other currencies also saw a consistent increase. The informal market for British and American currencies continued the momentum from the weekend, aggressively advancing and almost reaching the foreign exchange settlement prices of 6 pence for British gold and 10 yuan for the US dollar. The situation was exceptionally heated. Most operators and speculators seemed less cautious than before, actively preparing to compete. The market price fluctuated greatly, with tight conditions following a sharp decline, which was rare. The morning opening showed a state of British neutrality and American tightness due to the continued reduction of the American and British exchange rates. Afterwards, Chinese merchants and Hong Kong firms aggressively sold off, and many parties, seeing the unfavorable situation, also cut their positions. However, those entering the market to seek goods were rare. As a result, the disparity between buyers and sellers was significant. In less than half an hour, British gold rose to 5.8875 pence, and the US dollar also rose to 9.75 yuan. Subsequently, due to improved absorption by HSBC and the American Bank, the Bank of Japan took the opportunity to buy heavily, causing the price to soften to 5.5625 pence and 9.125 yuan in a short time. Then, due to the resurgence of Chinese merchants and the intensification of selling pressure, British gold rebounded to 5.71875 pence, and the US dollar also softened to 9.4375 yuan. However, the Bank of Japan's buying interest soon re-emerged, coupled with the relatively strong appetite of HSBC and other foreign banks, and the Hong Kong telegram also reversed from selling to buying. Therefore, by the noon close, the British gold was re-calculated at 5.53125 pence, and the US dollar was 9.125 yuan. In the afternoon, HSBC, the American Bank, and the Hong Kong telegram continued to absorb, briefly tightening the price to 5.375 pence and 8.875 yuan. Afterwards, the buying momentum dissipated, and the situation stabilized. By the close, British gold was 5.4375 pence, and the US dollar was 9 yuan, slightly softer by 0.125 and tighter by 0.25 compared to last Saturday. As for futures trading, the trend was similar to the spot market. Throughout the day, trading in the current period was still strong.

The morning opening price of spot goods for British gold was 5.5625 pence and 9.1875 yuan for the US dollar, compared with last weekend, British neutrality and American tightness increased by 0.0625, as a result of reduced exchange rates. After the opening, the Hong Kong telegram arrived clogged, and local speculators aggressively sold off, coupled with cutting of floating positions, and the appetite of foreign banks was extremely weak. In less than half an hour, British gold rose to 5.875 pence, and the US dollar also rose to 9.75 yuan. During that period, HSBC and other foreign banks, such as Bank of China, bought in at soft prices. The HSBC listing revealed an increase of half a pence for British gold and a large increase of 8.125 for the US dollar. The silver balancing tax listing did not change. Afterwards, the Bank of Japan suddenly took advantage of the low prices to settle, and HSBC and a certain American bank also had buying interest, causing the market to soften. At 9:50 AM, British gold had softened to 5.5625 pence, and the US dollar had also tightened to 9.125 yuan. Subsequently, due to the resurgence of Chinese merchants and the transfer of appetite from the buying side, the price trend became loose and hard again. British gold hardened again to 5.71875 pence, and the US dollar softened to 9.4375 yuan. Soon, HSBC took the opportunity to absorb again, and the Bank of Japan also came to force, and it was heard that the Hong Kong telegram had also returned to the market. Therefore, another softening was seen. Extended to noon close, the bank spot selling price, British gold had softened to 5.53125 pence, and the US dollar had also contracted to 9.125 yuan. It was heard that after the close, British gold softened again to 5.5 pence, and the US dollar tightened again to 9.0625 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn: Unfavorable Environment from Multiple Sides, Yarn Market Price Decline Rekindles

The price decline in the yarn market has begun again, and the situation is very weak. This is due to sluggish actual sales, prolonged foreign exchange extensions, and a blow to confidence. In particular, it has demoralized the bulls, and market conditions are declining daily. Most colleagues have a large amount of goods in hand and have suffered too much losses, so they are temporarily unwilling to sell at a loss. Furthermore, raw cotton prices are falling slowly. Therefore, although yarn prices are falling, the fluctuations are very frequent. In reality, the base is not as high as it used to be, so there is great resistance to downward movement. The fundamental problem is still struggling with actual sales.

Currently, the mood is scattered among yarn traders, because the environment is unfavorable from multiple sides and buyers from Guangdong are not actively purchasing. The opening price immediately dropped ten yuan, with 20-count "Double Horse" yarn priced at 630 yuan. News then spread that the issuance of drafts was becoming looser, and gold prices fell, which caused a temporary weakness, and prices fell another ten yuan, with a low price of 620 yuan. Shortly after, foreign exchange tightened, and confidence was restored. The closing price of "Double Horse" yarn was 624 yuan. According to the half-day trading statistics, 1,095 bales were traded. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell 14 yuan, "Shepherd" yarn fell 5 yuan, "Special Jincheng" yarn fell 9 yuan, and "Tiannu" yarn fell 10 yuan.

The volume of purchases made by various groups is listed below:

Ningbo: 50 Xiamen: 20

Inland: 20 Fuzhou: 30

Jiangxi: 30 Total: 1,090

### Shenxin Factory Begins Ordering American Cotton

The cotton trade remains as dull as ever. Factories are unusually slow to take delivery, mainly because yarn prices are not improving and the outlets are very narrow. As a result, they have no intention of purchasing raw materials for the time being. According to news from a certain cotton industry organization, Japanese merchants purchased a very large amount of American cotton a few days ago, and the price was cheaper than Indian cotton. Japanese factories are even less eager to absorb Chinese cotton. Yesterday, the Yong'an Factory traded 1,000 bales of Tongzhou cotton, with prices falling slightly more than two yuan. The supply from Northern Jiangsu included 2,401 bales of "arrived at Tong cotton", 1,322 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 1,930 bales of Beisha cotton. Today, 50 bales were shipped to Guangzhou Bay.

Trade among colleagues is also quite active. The purchases are all for American cotton. Yesterday, Shenxin also started to take action and ordered several thousand bales of American cotton. Other factories have also placed considerable orders. However, there have been no reports of any trades in Indian cotton.

The weather reports from the cotton regions were bad, and statistics on cloth sales increased sharply, which stimulated active trading in spot goods. Overseas cotton merchants were very aggressive in buying on the market, especially Indian traders. As a result, cotton prices rose, and the closing prices were 4 to 10 points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton futures also rose more than 2 rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose more than 10 points.

### Sugar Market: Rumors of Large Shipments of Domestic Sugar Arriving

Yesterday, according to sources at Jardine Matheson, Dutch coarse white sugar was at 6.90, and because foreign exchange remained loose, the trend was still weak.

### Piece Goods: Stockpilers Eager to Sell, Fine Cloth Prices Drop Sharply

The cloth market is experiencing a strong loosening of foreign exchange, and the minds of colleagues and stockpilers are wavering.

Local factory coarse cloth and coarse twill have fallen by 5 to 10 cents. However, Jardine Matheson coarse cloth, due to strong demand from customer groups, still maintains firm asking prices. The asking prices for bleached and dyed printed fabrics are extremely uneven, generally falling by 10 to 30 cents per piece. Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants have a large accumulation of goods waiting to be shipped due to slow ship traffic. Therefore, new trading demand has slightly declined. Transactions included a hundred or so pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, and colored twill. Fujian merchants bought fifty to sixty boxes of colored twill, and Yunnan merchants bought more than three thousand pieces of colored cloth, flannel, and colored twill. Local merchants traded more than five thousand pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and flannel. Retail sales are currently quite good.

Yesterday, both white and colored piece goods continued to decline in the East Piece Goods Market. In the morning market, 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth plummeted to 18 yuan per piece. "Four Gentlemen" yuan serge was at 59.5 cents per yard. In the afternoon market, colleagues with bullish sentiments temporarily boosted prices in the market. "Dragon Head" cloth rose back to 18.40 yuan, and serge reached 60 cents. Ultimately, due to the sluggish market sentiment, prices fell again. At closing, "Dragon Head" fine cloth was at 18.15 yuan, falling 80 cents from last week. Other mid-to-low grade brands of fine cloth also fell by 30 to 50 cents. Fine twill fell by 20 to 35 cents per piece. The current quoted price for "Dragon Head" baby cloth is 17.25 yuan, with only more than 400 pieces traded in this market.

The sales of pure wool fine twill, floral, and herringbone Polish overcoat fabrics costing 20 yuan per yard are especially strong, with supply unable to meet demand.

### Metals: Tin Rebounds After Fatigue

Recently, due to the gradual increase in sales from various regions, tin merchants in this market are unwilling to sell easily due to supply disruptions. The current market price for refined tin (99.9% purity) is 1,200 yuan per dan; 99.75% purity is 1,100 yuan per dan (but these two grades are very scarce in the current market); 99.5% purity (this is the most common grade on the market) is 1,000 yuan per dan.

### The 45th Division of the Chinese Army Fiercely Attacks Japanese Troops on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway; High-Speed Marching Prevents Japanese Reinforcements from Arriving in Time; Japanese Casualties Number in the Hundreds Over Two Days and Nights; Japanese Instructor Injured in Battle in Nanhui County

The triangular area within the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Suzhou-Jiaxing railways spans the borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Because it is a land of crisscrossing rivers and swamps, mobile Chinese army units are ferrying across the Qiantang River to the north bank and continuously entering to replenish forces. Therefore, the current number of personnel is sufficient to break through any Japanese stronghold on the railway. Since the last time a large force encircled and annihilated the Japanese troops at Fengjing Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and destroyed two bridges, Xitang Town, more than 30 li west of Fengjing, was regarded as a guerrilla base and suffered a major disaster. Civilians died under bullets and bayonets, and many houses in the town were destroyed. Although the Chinese army was not attacked, they all vowed to do their best to avenge the people of Xitang.

Chinese Forces Attack with Swift Tactics

Between the 2nd and 3rd of this month, the Tian division of the 45th Chinese Army, which was scattered along the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border and on the shores of Dian Lake (it is said that the previous attack on Fengjing and destruction of the two bridges was also carried out by the Tian division), marched at high speed, passed through the foothills of Tianma Mountain, and advanced towards Songjiang County. One unit bypassed the Sisong Highway, rushed near the Mingxing Bridge, and engaged the Japanese army in a fierce battle north of the railway. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented, and Songjiang County was almost surrounded. Commander Tian, ​​wearing several car tires, took the lead. A bullet hit his chest, embedding itself in the tire and not penetrating, so he was not injured. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops retreated steadily.

Brief Assault on Mingxing Bridge Station

Mingxing Bridge Station was almost recaptured. The Songjiang Japanese garrison, the Fuji Department, urgently telegraphed Shanghai for help. In desperation, the Japanese army dispatched four or five hundred reinforcements by land and water from Pudong Nanhui, Chuansha, and Longhua Minhang areas in western Shanghai to rescue and relieve the siege. However, the Chinese army’s strategy was miraculous. Before the Japanese reinforcements arrived, they captured a large number of war trophies and retreated west. The Japanese army suffered hundreds of casualties in two days and nights, and lost countless military supplies. After the Japanese reinforcements arrived, they did not dare to pursue westward, fearing that the defenses elsewhere would be empty, so they hurriedly returned to their original positions to prevent guerrillas from taking advantage of the situation.

Japanese Assault on Zha Port Encounters Formidable Opponents

On the morning of the 4th, another fierce encounter between Chinese and Japanese troops occurred upstream of Zha Port in Punan. Water traffic at Zha Port was completely cut off. Flights from Shanghai to Jinhui Bridge, Luhui New Market, and other places within Zha Port were forced to return one after another upon arriving at the port. This battle was due to the Japanese discovering that guerrilla leader Fan Gencai had gone to Shanghai on business, so they attempted to deal a heavy blow while he was away. Unbeknownst to them, other military personnel were commanding the operation for the Chinese. At dawn on the morning of the 4th, the Japanese army sent more than 100 soldiers from Pubei, traveling on several speedboats, and charged into Zha Port, carrying out a so-called "mopping-up" operation. Chinese soldiers stationed on the Pudong side of Zha Port discovered this and immediately notified their base. Under an emergency assembly order, they blocked the Japanese forces from three sides west of Lujiahui and north of Jinhui Bridge.

Heavy Casualties on Both Sides After Fierce Fighting

The Japanese troops disembarked and engaged in a fierce battle. The Japanese army was not equipped with steel cannons, using rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades as weapons. Therefore, the Chinese army was not inferior in terms of weapons. Bullets flew thick and fast, like a string of pearls. By noon, both sides had suffered casualties. The Japanese army made no progress. Fearing that their retreat would be cut off, they re-boarded the speedboats and withdrew from Zha Port. Water traffic at Zha Port was restored to its original state from the 5th. According to another account, the battle was caused by the Japanese army seeking revenge for a Japanese soldier who was shot dead by the guerrillas.

Japanese Troops in Nanhui Attack Erzaohong

Since being unified under the command of Xu Zhidao, the Zhongyi Salvation Army in Pudong has spared no effort in disrupting communications. Therefore, the Japanese side is paying close attention. In the latter half of last month, the Japanese convened a military conference in Nanhui City to discuss their so-called large-scale "mopping-up" plan against Xu's troops. After a decision was made, the Japanese launched an attack on Xu's troops from several routes on the morning of the 27th, coming on strong. Xu's troops discovered this and ordered all units to prepare for battle. At about 8 o'clock, Japanese instructor Takeda led more than 200 Japanese troops, carrying heavy artillery, machine guns, and other sharp weapons, to attack a certain brigade defense area of Xu's troops in Rising Sun Township, and the troops responded immediately. For a time, the fighting was fierce, and the sound of artillery fire filled the air. Nearby villagers fled one after another. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese side received reinforcements from a certain brigade and was encircled from four sides by Xu's troops' Xu, Huang, and Yan brigades. The Japanese army, fearing being surrounded, changed its attack to Erzaohong. Xu's troops also changed their strategy, flanking the Japanese army from both wings. The Japanese army was defeated and retreated in disarray towards Nanhui City. It is said that Japanese instructor Takeda was wounded by a bullet in the battle. Currently, the battle situation between the two sides remains in a stalemate.

Special Security at North Railway Station

From 1 PM yesterday, special security measures were suddenly implemented at the North Railway Station in Zhabei. Pedestrians and vehicles were prohibited from passing along the railway from Xinmin Road to Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, and North Sichuan Road to the east, and to Gonghexin Road to the west. Sentries were heavily deployed along the way. In addition to deploying fifty or sixty armed Japanese naval marines, weapons such as machine guns and small cannons were set up on the north and south platforms of the railway station. The situation was very serious at one point. According to the Japanese side, General Nishio, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, along with his staff officer, Lieutenant General Itagaki, and other staff members, came to Shanghai from Nanjing. However, it remains to be confirmed.

### Preparations for Memorial Service Following the Death of Ma Xiangbo; Aurora College Schedules Memorial Service; Fellow Townsmen in Zhenjiang Telegraphed Condolences Yesterday

The news of the passing of centenarian Ma Xiangbo in Liangshan, Vietnam, at 3 PM on the 4th has spread to Shanghai, causing widespread mourning. It is reported that condolences have been telegraphed one after another. Regarding the exact time of Ma's death, according to his great-grandson, Zhang Chongren, it was indeed 3 PM on the 4th. The telegram from Chongqing reported it as 6 PM, which may be inaccurate. Currently, the family members who are attending the funeral in Liangshan are only his daughter-in-law, Qiu Renwu, and his granddaughter, Yu Zhang. His grandson-in-law, Xie Wenhua, is in Chongqing, working in an organization with Yu Youren's son. In addition, there are two grandsons, namely Jinghua and Roma, who are currently studying at the Southwest Associated University in Guilin and once served on the front lines. The rumor that all three of them are in Liangshan is incorrect. Therefore, there are very few people handling funeral affairs in Liangshan. I originally intended to travel to Liangshan, but the journey would take 20 days, and there is no way to shorten it, so I had to cancel the trip in order to stay in Shanghai to handle the memorial service.

A telegram from Chongqing on the 6th: Yu Youren of the Supervisory Yuan telegraphed condolences to the family of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, saying, "To the Honorable Widow Yu Zhang, Grandniece, relayed by the Consulate in Hanoi: The death of Master Xiangbo has shocked the world. The flames of Japan are dying, and the revival of China is in sight. Heaven did not spare his life, causing him to not witness the celebratory ceremony, which is truly regrettable. Please accept this telegram of condolences and take comfort. Yu Youren."

Various Groups to Hold Meeting Tomorrow

Since receiving the telegram from the family of Old Ma, the Danyang Fellow Townsmen Association has telegraphed condolences to Liangshan. Now, knowing that Old Ma is respected for his virtue and age and is universally admired, not only has he devoted himself to national affairs throughout his life, but he has also shown sincere concern for his hometown, they have sent letters to fellow townsmens' associations in Zhenjiang, Liyang, Jintan, and other charitable organizations such as the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, scheduling a tea party at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3 PM on (8th) to discuss the organization of a preparatory committee and schedule a memorial service to express their sorrow.

Fellow Townsmen in Zhenjiang Telegraph Condolences

"To the Family of Old Ma Xiangbo in Liangshan: Upon receiving the tragic news, we were shocked to learn of Old Ma's sudden passing. Remembering Old Ma's long and virtuous life, upholding the middle path, as a model for his hometown and a teacher for humanity, Heaven did not pity him, depriving us of our virtuous elder, shocking the nation and causing widespread mourning. In addition to joining various groups in Shanghai to hold a memorial service, we hereby telegraph our condolences and express our deepest sorrow. Wu Yunzhai, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, Standing Committee Members Tang Shoumin, Chen Peide, Chen Juchuan, Hu Chunlin, et al."

Catholic Faithful Unite in Mourning

Upon learning of the death of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Catholic faithful in Shanghai expressed their grief. Ma was not only a veteran of the party and the country, but also a devout Catholic since childhood, baptized with the Christian name Joseph. Previously, during the drafting of the constitution, he joined Lu Bohong, Zhu Zhiyao, and other leaders of 3 million Catholics nationwide in advocating to the government for religious freedom. He made considerable contributions to the church. Therefore, Catholic organizations in Shanghai, such as the Catholic Action Association, have not only telegraphed condolences to Liangshan, but have also initiated a memorial mass with Catholic rites to show their condolences.

Aurora College Memorial Ceremony

Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Aurora College in this city, passed away in Shishan. The school immediately received a telegram and sent a telegram in the name of all faculty, students, and the alumni association to express condolences to the family of Old Ma. They also scheduled a memorial mass at the St. Peter's Church on Rue Luber on Wednesday, the 15th of this month, at 7:30 AM, inviting relatives, friends, and acquaintances of Old Ma to participate in the prayers. The school will also be closed on that day to express their sorrow.

Fudan Discusses Memorial Arrangements

Old Ma was also the founder of Fudan University. After receiving the news of the death of the elder, the school also sent a telegram in the name of all faculty and students to express condolences. They scheduled a meeting convened by the alumni association to discuss memorial arrangements.

The Zhu Brothers Recount Past Events

Yesterday, this newspaper published a biography of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, stating that Ma was born in 1839. Yesterday morning, this newspaper's reporter met with Ma Xiangbo's nephews, Zhu Zhiyao and Jilin. According to Mr. Jilin, Ma Xiangbo was born on April 28, 1840, which is the 16th day of the third month of the Gengzi year of Daoguang, not 1839. It was also said that since receiving the news of Old Ma's death, the president of the Aurora College has inquired about another nephew, the current Zhu bishop of Nantong, who is in Shanghai, so that a memorial service can be held. According to Mr. Zhiyao, there are many anecdotes about Old Ma's life. When Aurora College was founded, Zhiyao initially contributed 500 gold pieces to promote its establishment and provided meals and lodging. Old Ma often shared meals and talked with outstanding students. At that time, Mr. Yu Youren had passed the imperial examination and came to Shanghai from Shaanxi to study at Aurora College. Ma greatly favored him. Yu once recorded the "Return Home" essay by the great Confucian Wang Yue of Shaanxi in harmony with Tao Yuanming's poem and presented it to Old Ma, because its words were in line with Catholic doctrines. Old Ma deeply cherished this essay and instructed Yu to write a copy for him. Yu then personally wrote ten large scrolls as a gift and posted them in the Hall of Joy. Old Ma happily collected words from its phrases to write couplets, and Mr. Zhiyao made a new annotation for him.

### Following Strong Negotiations by the Portuguese Consulate, the Tang-Class Portuguese Ship is Released; Tanglu, Tangqiao, and Tangbei Ships Regain Freedom; the Japanese Flag on the Forecastle Has Been Removed and the Ship Will be Docked for Repairs Soon; Damage Has Lasted for More Than Half a Year

Starting on April 8 of this year, the Japanese naval authorities detained more than a dozen Portuguese merchant ships on the sea off Zhejiang and outside the Wusongkou, forcing them to dock at the Yangshupu River buoy. Each ship was guarded by two armed Japanese sailors, and the Japanese naval flag was hoisted on the bow. After the incident occurred, all Portuguese merchant shipping was suspended. The Portuguese Consulate General repeatedly protested and negotiated, but after more than half a year, little progress was made. Apart from the release of the Hailong, owned by the Atlantic Company, about ten days ago, there has been no news of the release of the other ships. According to information obtained by a Dagong News Agency reporter from the shipping industry, recently, in order to quickly resolve the case and ensure the interests of Portuguese merchants, the Portuguese Consulate General strongly negotiated with the Japanese side. As of last Saturday (the 4th), the Japanese side agreed to release the Tanglu, Tangqiao, and Tangbei ships, and notified the Portuguese Consulate General for verification. The details of the negotiations are not known.

Moving to Dock for Repairs; Soon to Set Sail

The Tang-class ships were originally docked at buoy No. 27 in the Yangshupu River. After the Japanese side notified the approval for their return, all the Japanese sailors stationed on the ships withdrew. The Japanese naval flag hoisted on the foremast was also removed. The China-America Navigation Company dispatched a tugboat at about 10 AM yesterday to tow the three ships to buoys Nos. 33 and 34 in front of the Yangshupu Power Plant, mooring them alongside the Tangsai ship of the company. It is reported that the ships will soon enter the dock to repair the machinery and repaint the hull, and then resume sailing. It is said that the Tangsai and Tanglu ships will first join the Shanghai-Wenzhou route.

Continued Negotiations for the Remaining Ships

A reporter from Dagong News Agency also learned from the shipping industry that among the dozen or so detained Portuguese ships, apart from the Hailong, Tanglu, Tangqiao, and Tangbei ships, which have been released one after another, and the Dade and Lude ships, which were forced to cooperate with the Japanese side and were also released, there are still several ships that are currently detained, including the Meida of the American Company, the Libao and Fulu of the Zhen De Company, and the Fade of the Far East Shipping Company. There are also the Shantay of the Zhen De Company and the Meifa of the American Company, which have also been forced to suspend navigation. It is reported that the Portuguese Consulate General has decided to continue to negotiate on the basis of reason in order to release all ships as soon as possible and resume business.

Hailong Repairs Completed; Route Undecided

The Hailong ship of the Portuguese Atlantic Navigation Company was released on the 21st of last month. It immediately entered the Qiuxin Factory in Nanshi to inspect the hull, then sailed to buoys Nos. 29 and 30 in Yangshupu to paint the hull and cabins. The repairs have now been completed, but the route has not yet been decided, so it is still docked at the Pujiang River. Also, the diesel-powered plywood boats Dade and Lude, after cooperating with the Japanese side and registering with the puppet "Shipping Bureau," were also released by the Japanese side, but the route has not been determined and they have not yet sailed.

### Return Voyage of Sino-Indian Line Steamships, Combining Shanghai-Bay Route; Reduced Vessels, Increased Cargo Turnover; Loading Additional Cargo on Return to Shanghai

The Sino-Indian line vessels managed by the British company, Apcar & Co., travel according to a schedule. They start from Calcutta, pass through various Southeast Asian locations and Hong Kong, and then arrive in Shanghai. From Shanghai, they go to Japan, then directly to Hong Kong, and return to Calcutta via the original Southeast Asian route. Since the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, the number of ships on the British company's Europe-Asia route has decreased, but cargo turnover in Southeast Asia remains high. Therefore, the

Apcar Voyage

has been slightly altered. After coming from India to Shanghai and going to Japan, it now returns to Shanghai, where it loads additional cargo before heading to Hong Kong, passing through various Southeast Asian locations, and returning to Calcutta. The "Heracules" is sailing according to the newly changed route. It arrived in Shanghai from Japan the day before yesterday and will depart from Shanghai to Hong Kong today, returning to Calcutta. The British company's "Somanly" mail steamer has already arrived in Shanghai and is docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. It is said that it will not go to Japan this time, but will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then return to Europe. The American President Lines'

"President Pierce"

arrived in Shanghai from Xiaoluzong via Hong Kong at approximately 9:00 AM yesterday. It is docked at Floating Pontoon No. 12.11 and is scheduled to depart for Japan and Honolulu at 4:30 PM today, returning to Los Angeles. The last tender for passengers is yet to be decided, will depart from the Xinguankou Wharf at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Also, the "President Coolidge" arrived from the United States and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 AM this morning, berthed at Floating Pontoon Nos. 11 and 12. The tender for passengers departed from the Xinguankou Wharf at 9:30 AM this morning and returned to the Xinguankou Wharf at 11:00 AM with the passengers. The large vessel is scheduled to depart at 5:30 AM tomorrow for Hong Kong and Xiaoluzong. The last tender for passengers will depart from the Xinguankou Wharf at 1:00 AM tonight. The Java Company's mail steamer

"Tjibadak"

was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, but it is now known that it arrived earlier, entering the port at noon yesterday (the 6th) and docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. Passengers disembarked at the Xinguankou Wharf in the afternoon. The large vessel is scheduled to depart on the 9th, returning to Surabaya via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and various Southeast Asian locations.

### Southeast Asian Capital Concentrates in Shanghai; Rumors of Control Over Hong Kong Dollars

Since the outbreak of war in Europe, although Hong Kong is located in the Far East and has not been significantly affected, the economic situation has clearly changed. Many Chinese who own assets and reside in Hong Kong to avoid the war previously operated businesses there. Since the European war, most of Hong Kong's floating capital has shifted its investment direction. Recently, Shanghai's real estate and other industries have seen a large amount of investment from Hong Kong investors. Shanghai's financial market has also experienced a booming atmosphere due to the concentration of Hong Kong capital in Shanghai. Yesterday, financial circles in this city reported that Hong Kong is preparing to implement controls on the large outflow of capital. If this measure is implemented, people with savings in Hong Kong will be within the scope of the controls. However, the local banking community is still waiting for further news regarding the detailed measures. According to banking sources, remittances from Southeast Asia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places to Shanghai have been quite active recently, which has enlivened the Shanghai financial market.

### Resetting the Market Price of Coal Balls

Coal balls are one of the necessities of life for citizens. Fluctuations in their price are related to the burden on citizens. However, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the past and the sudden outbreak of war in Europe, the cost of coal has increased, and the selling price of coal balls was once raised. Now, after deliberation by trade associations, the retail price is set at 3.70 yuan per dan (unit of weight). The current selling price of coal balls can be stabilized and will not increase further. However, the expansion of the European war is closely related to our situation.

### Anniversary of the Founding of the U.S. Marine Corps; Admiral Hart Inspects; The 164th Anniversary is This Month on the 10th; The 4th Regiment Stationed in Shanghai Receives Inspection and Flag Presentation

This month on the 10th is the 164th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps. The U.S. 4th Marine Regiment is actively preparing to hold a commemoration. At that time, a military exercise will be held at the Racecourse Parade Ground, inspected by Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and his Chief of Staff, Admiral Connell. During the inspection, Admiral Hart will present the new regimental flag to the soldiers of the U.S. 4th Regiment, who will be dressed in military uniforms. A unit of the Marine Corps Guard will wear specially made military uniforms of various colors, so that the spectators can see the changes in the U.S. Marine Corps military uniforms since 1775. The military exercise will be held that day, commanded by the current Commander of the 4th Regiment, Colonel Fegan, with the entire regiment participating. Colonel Fegan will be at the head of the procession, serving as the Commander of the Regiment. Admiral Hart and his Chief of Staff, Admiral Connell, will inspect the troops. It is said that this inspection is open to the public and military commanders, officers, and consuls from various countries in Shanghai have been invited to attend. The design of the flag that Admiral Hart will present features a purple-red center with an eagle perched on a circular line, which is slightly similar to the original old flag with a light color as the background. It is scheduled that in the afternoon of that day, a banquet will be held at the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment Club in Duoqiaonong, Jing'an Temple Road, with music and dancing to add to the festivities and celebration. The American community in this city also plans to participate in the commemoration.

### Negotiations on Cross-Boundary Road Construction; Opinions Have Not Yet Converged; Authorities Propose that Both Sides Send an Equal Number of Personnel to Jointly Organize an Agency to Maintain Public Order

Fan Keling, Director-General of the Public Works Department, and Fei Lipu, General Manager and Director, visited the puppet Mayor Fu Xiao'an in the afternoon of the 2nd, and submitted the PWD's proposal on the police power issue of road construction outside the boundary in the western district. At the time, it was said that Fu Xiao'an promised to consider the proposal, and there was a trend towards a sharp turnaround in the future of the negotiations. However, many days have passed since then, and the opinions of both sides

Have Not Yet Converged

Fu Xiao'an has not yet responded to the PWD's proposal, and it seems that the negotiations have stalled again. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency learned the contents of the proposal from diplomatic circles yesterday. It seems that the proposal is more complete in meaning than previous rumors. It is said that the PWD's proposal includes: (1) Both sides will send an equal number of police officers to jointly organize

a responsible agency

to maintain public order in the area of road construction outside the boundary. (2) The police power over the roads constructed outside the boundary and the areas on both sides will be under the jurisdiction of the PWD, while other areas will be jointly managed by both sides. It is also stated that the PWD's intention is not to establish a permanent agreement to resolve the issue of road construction outside the boundary, but only to discuss some temporary applicable measures to stop the friction between the two sides. Once the situation in Shanghai changes, this agreement will become invalid.

### Repayment Draw for National Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds for the First Time; Funds Allocated to Reserve for Payment; Bank of China Ordered to Begin Payment

In order to raise funds for the war of resistance and to collect gold, foreign currencies, foreign exchange, and foreign securities to fund relief efforts, the National Government issued National Defense Bonds of 500 million yuan, Gold Bonds of 100 million customs gold units, Gold Bonds of 10 million pounds sterling, and Gold Bonds of 50 million U.S. dollars on May 1, 1938. The Ministry of Finance sent letters to various groups and organizations to solicit contributions. The people of the whole country and overseas compatriots supported the government's war of resistance and donated money to the government, and enthusiastically subscribed to the bonds with excellent results.

Winning Numbers for the First Repayment

The Ministry of Finance held the first repayment draw for the National Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds at the end of October. The winning numbers are recorded below: (1) Gold Bonds in customs gold units: three bonds, No. 224, No. 576, No. 902; (2) Gold Bonds in pounds sterling: three bonds, No. 073, No. 544, No. 765; (3) Gold Bonds in U.S. dollars: three bonds, No. 105, No. 319, No. 449; (4) National Defense Bonds: four bonds, No. 063, No. 312, No. 480, No. 546.

Repayment of Principal and Interest Begins

The funds for the repayment of principal and interest due on October 31st of this year for the National Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds have been allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank and deposited in the account of the National Debt Fund Management Committee for these two types of public bonds, specifically earmarked for payment. (1) Gold Bonds in customs gold: 300,000 customs gold units for principal and 2.5 million customs gold units for interest; (2) Gold Bonds in pounds sterling: 30,000 pounds sterling for principal and 250,000 pounds sterling for interest; (3) Gold Bonds in U.S. dollars: 150,000 U.S. dollars for principal and 1.25 million U.S. dollars for interest; (4) National Defense Bonds: 2 million yuan in national currency for principal and 15 million yuan in national currency for interest. The above principal and interest to be repaid have been paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted banks since November 1st.

Central Bank Ordered to Comply

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with banking circles yesterday: (1) The National Defense Bonds are guaranteed by the entire income from income tax; (2) The Gold Bonds are designated to be purchased and stored by the Salt Administration in accordance with the regulations for the repayment of principal and interest, with the amounts determined each period. The funds for the National Defense Bonds are managed by the National Debt Management Committee, while the funds for the Gold Bonds are managed by a separate Fund Custody Committee. The collateral for both types of public bonds is reliable, so subscriptions were very enthusiastic. Regarding the repayment of principal and interest, payments have been made by the Central Bank and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, which are entrusted by the Central Bank. However, the three banks in Shanghai, the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications, do not handle this payment business. However, Chinese citizens holding winning bonds and interest coupons can entrust a bank to collect the money from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications in Chongqing.

### The Sunken Japanese Steamer "Shintaigu Maru"; Salvage Work; The Location of the Sinking Has Been Determined

Three weeks ago, the Japanese-owned steamer "Shintaigu Maru" of the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. (formerly the Nisshin Steamship Company), was sailing from Xingang back to Shanghai. Twelve miles outside the Wusongkou, it was suddenly hit by a "cloudless storm". Due to the excessive weight of the ship and its inability to turn around, it sank, and 340 passengers were killed, as previously reported. It is now learned that the shipping company is attempting to salvage the ship. Three days after the ship sank, it commissioned the Taishan Trading Company to investigate and explore the location of the sunken ship. Another search was conducted last week, and it was determined that the "Shintaigu Maru" is sunk in the mud 50 feet below the water surface at the confluence of the Huangpu and Yangtze Rivers. The company believes that salvage is possible and that it can be salvaged in about a month. It is estimated that the total value of the "Shintaigu Maru," its cargo of cotton, and other goods is approximately one million yuan. It is believed that the cotton in the cabin can still be sold after the ship is raised, because the fiber in the cotton will not decompose and become ineffective until three to four months after being immersed in water.

### Ding Xishan and Others Vow to Serve the Country to the Death

Ding Xishan and others of the Pudong Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Army, led their troops in combat in the suburbs of Shanghai, loyal and steadfast. It is learned that Ding's residence was burned down a month ago, and Ding's mother, at the age of seventy, was brutally murdered with knives. No other employees survived. On the day of the family funeral, Ding went in person to mourn, and was almost captured. With national crisis and family hatred, Ding vowed to carry out orders to the death and serve the country.

### Landlord of Mingde Village on Jin Shenfu Road Raises Rent; Tenants Firmly Oppose

The landlord of Mingde Village on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, the Dafafang Company (i.e., Ma Changji), yesterday commissioned lawyer Wang Hengyi as its representative to notify the tenants that rents would be increased by 30% starting in November. The tenants rose up in opposition and elected Chen Guanghai, Liu Fei Wu, Fang Chaozong, Ni Shenzhong and others as representatives to negotiate with the landlord, expressing their rejection and commissioning lawyer Gu Cangsheng to send a letter to the landlord notifying them of their opposition to the rent increase. It is reported that the landlord cited the prosperity of the village as an important reason for the rent increase. However, the tenants believe that the village is adjacent to the Chinese area (just a short distance from Xiaohama), the area is remote, and few people have ever lived there. Less than one-third of the houses in the whole village can be rented out. However, after August 13th, refugees flocked to the village to rent houses, causing all the houses, alley verandas, and even garages to be rented out to people. The landlord then considers the large number of refugees living there as prosperity, but does not know that those who live there suffer from the pain of rising prices, causing the tenants to rise up in opposition. It is also heard that the tenants' will is extremely firm.

### Landlord Fails to Raise Rent, Beats Tenant

Zhang Shungao, a 26-year-old Suzhou native and accountant at the Dajiangnan Hotel at 410 Fujian Road in the Public Concession, has lived with his family in the front building of No. 20 Chongde Fang, Minguo Road, outside Xiaobeimen for four or five years. The second landlord is Wang Guochu, a 29-year-old Ningbo native and owner of the Guoguang Knitting Factory. Zhang's rent is 14 yuan per month. Since the war, the second landlord, seeing the abnormal development of the market, has repeatedly demanded rent increases without success, causing resentment between the landlord and tenant, and they often quarrel over trivial matters. At 4:00 PM on the 4th of this month, another quarrel arose over a trivial matter. Wang's mother and sister first surrounded Zhang and slapped him in the face. Then Wang ordered the workers in the factory to twist Zhang and beat him, causing him to be injured and covered in wounds. After breaking free, Zhang first reported to the police station. Yesterday morning, he filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District Court, requesting a wound examination. At the same time, he filed a criminal self-accusation against the second landlord Wang Guochu in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, requesting that he be investigated and prosecuted according to law for the crime of injury.

### Secrets Hidden in Suitcase; Opium and Morphine Seized; Two Female Criminals Arrested

Zhao Chenshi, 34 years old, the wife of Zhao Xinmei, a Pudong native living at 140 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, was carrying a white large suitcase at about 8:00 AM the day before yesterday and was planning to take a rickshaw to the Bund to return to her hometown across the river. When she arrived at the intersection of Fada Road and Zilai Street, she was stopped by patrolling detectives who were checking pedestrians. They opened the suitcase and found that it had a false bottom. Clothes were placed on top, and hidden underneath were 78 packets of raw opium and 3 packets of white powder morphine, worth more than 1,300 yuan. The person and evidence were taken to the police station. Under interrogation, they went to Room 414 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road and arrested Zhu Yiqing (61 years old, a Pudong native living at 114 Xiamen Road). Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the trial. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the police station stated the case, saying that the defendants were involved in opium trafficking and requested a postponement of the investigation before further questioning. According to detectives, Zhao Chenshi confessed that her husband had asked Zhu Yiqing in Room 414 of the Dongya Hotel to call a Mr. Tang at Room 526 of the Yangzi Hotel to send the opium to Zhao Chenshi's house. She paid him 300 yuan in advance. Now, in order to conduct a detailed investigation, they requested a postponement. Zhao Chenshi confessed that her husband was in the flower club business and she worked in an egg factory. Her husband asked Zhu Yiqing to call a Mr. Tang at the Yangzi Hotel to send the opium to her house and told her to take it to Pudong. Zhu Yiqing confessed that he was in the rice business and that Zhao Xinmei asked him to make a phone call, but he did not know about the opium trafficking. The court verified the confessions and ordered a postponement of the hearing to the 15th. The defendants were taken into custody.

### Master Yuan Ying Still Detained in Jiangwan

Since Yuan Ying, chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was abducted, there have been various rumors about his whereabouts. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the Buddhist Association, Yuan Ying is still being detained in Jiangwan, and the rumors of his transfer to Beijing are unreliable. His disciple, Mingyang, is also being detained in a separate room. The reason for the detention seems to have no political motives and is gradually becoming clear. However, Yuan Ying did not hand over the funds raised in Southeast Asia to the Huozhen Wuhui (Fire Prevention Association), so the expenses are very unclear. After the Huozhen Wuhui telegraphed Shanghai for a thorough investigation, they are now conducting a detailed investigation separately.

### Chen Zhanxiong and Prison Guards Accused of Malfeasance and Bribery; Two Fugitive Guards Ordered to Be Wanted

Chen Zhanxiong, the owner of the Anlegong Hotel dance hall, was arrested for smoking opium and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. He was sentenced to six months in prison, with three yuan substituted for one day, and the fine was commuted. He was first sent to the detention center and ordered to quit smoking within a month, resulting in the detainees Qin Jiaqi, Tao Yongchang, and Chen Jusheng colluding with the guards Luo Zhiyi, Jiang Nai, and Tu Gang to extort 150 yuan twice, which they divided among themselves. The warden discovered this and reported it to the supervising section, and Chen and the other prisoners and guards were transferred to the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. Jiang and Tu escaped while taking advantage of the situation. After the prosecutor's investigation concluded, he believed that Chen Zhanxiong was also guilty of bribery and ordered him to be released on bail pending further investigation. The others were sent to prison. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. The prosecutor has now filed a public prosecution with the same-level court against the accused for crimes such as malfeasance and bribery. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Minsheng, together with the prosecutor, opened a court session for trial. Chen Zhanxiong claimed to be ill and was represented by lawyer Jiang Pingfan. After the prosecutor stated the reasons for the prosecution, the confessions of Luo Zhiyi, Tao Yongchang, Qin Jiaqi, and Chen Jusheng mutually shifted responsibility. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing, and the defendants were taken into custody. It was found that Tao Yongchang, one of the defendants, had been sentenced to ten years in prison for murder and had just been paroled two weeks ago. He was taken into custody yesterday after the case. Qin Jiaqi was originally a guard who was sentenced to one year and six months in prison for committing forgery. While serving his sentence, he extorted money from Chen, adding crime to crime. The court has now ordered the arrest of the two fugitive guards.

### Old Age and Serious Illness; Ineffective Medical Treatment; Died After Being Given a Cardiotonic Injection; Family Negotiations Fail to Resolve; Report to Police Station Awaiting Investigation

Zhang Guangwen, a 53-year-old Taizhou native living at No. A-772 Beile Road, was suffering from a serious illness and medication was ineffective.

### Extravagance Should Be Avoided in Weddings and Funerals; Cherish Materials, Especially During Times of Difficulty; Save on Waste and Cultivate a Habit of Thrift; —Admonitions to All Sectors from the Thrift Association—

The Shanghai Thrift Movement Committee believes that wealthy families in Shanghai still often engage in extravagant displays for weddings and funerals, even sending out invitations widely and staging elaborate performances. This not only disturbs friends and relatives but also wastes resources. Yesterday, they issued another letter to all sectors, hoping to avoid extravagance.

Advocating Thrift

The original text states: "Upon investigation, people in the upper and middle classes of Shanghai, for weddings and funerals, and even for unnecessary events such as a child's first month or first birthday, a person's 30th birthday, or the death anniversaries of deceased parents, are still issuing invitations on a large scale and staging grand performances. This not only wastes resources but also disturbs friends and relatives. Such extravagance has become a trend, and people continue to follow suit, believing that they are not showing off their wealth enough unless they do so. Since the outbreak of the 'August 13th' War of Resistance, most enlightened people, feeling the urgency of the national crisis, have mostly engaged in thrift for celebrations, weddings, and funerals.

The Trend of Extravagance

began to subside slightly. However, since Shanghai fell into the state of an isolated island, the extravagance has returned and is becoming more intense recently. Business and industrial leaders are again engaging in major extravagance for weddings and funerals, even inviting famous actors and singers to perform grand performances. At this extraordinary time, the government is sparing no effort in promoting the thrift movement. People in leadership positions should set an example, take the lead, and create a thrifty atmosphere in society. Yet they cannot

Understand the Difficulties of the Times

and cherish resources, only showing off their wealth and boasting about their status. It is truly lamentable to speak of this. Our association cannot remain silent in the face of danger, so we dare to sincerely advise and hope that leaders from all sectors will refrain from unnecessary celebrations, and for major events such as weddings and funerals, they must avoid extravagance, earnestly practice the principles of thrift, and save on waste to help those in need. If these gentlemen can take the lead, all will respond, and perhaps the bad habit of extravagance can be eradicated, the thrift movement can be promoted, and the future of the War of Resistance can truly benefit from it. We have spoken frankly, hoping for your clear understanding."

After being discovered by the manager, he was arrested. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court and prosecuted for embezzlement. The defendant, Jin Rongkang, admitted to using the embezzled money for gambling dens and now wishes to find a way to compensate for it, requesting leniency from the judge.

### On Sectarianism

— Mu Chang

Sects and parties are two absolutely different categories. The former is merely a manifestation of favoritism by a minority, with its feudal traditionalism; the latter is based on the position of the masses, with the so-called true ideology existing.

Sectarianism is most undesirable. It benefits "individualists" but harms the "collective." It hinders unity and even destroys the united front. Whether it is a social group or a production sector, once there is a trace of sectarianism, the entire organization is inevitably ruined. Infighting, monopolization, conservatism, and exclusive control are all their masterpieces. However, do they truly do anything beneficial for everyone? That is not necessarily the case, except for what benefits themselves.

Within the organization of a "party," the concrete and subtle manifestation of sectarianism is engaging in secret cliques. ... Each seeks their own interests, engaging in squeezing, framing, taking credit, expanding the power of "associates," and eliminating the position of others, using every means possible. And the slogan they raise to the general public is: If you want to join, it must be based on "our" principles. From this comes the establishment of secret societies, taking in disciples, with ideology merely a euphemism for who is above and who is below, and nothing else.

Sectarians often borrow the name of the party to connect with emotions they share with others. At the same time, they are very clever and will cite stories as justification: "Godier, wearing a red vest, fought with classical actors in the theater, and Ilyich, who cared for his comrades, laughed and scolded Deborin in his notes. These are not examples of excluding dissidents, but rather have their own positive significance." Their words solemnly point out that their own fortress is actually a new camp, but upon close inspection, their content remains consistent with the old tradition.

And as sectarianism continues to grow, it seems to adopt the actions of the Boxers. They ignore the existence of anything outside their small circle and despise all so-called "outsiders" and "non-orthodox派"! However, their internal contradictions have not been eliminated, and they still fixate on the hierarchy between senior and junior members. This is naturally not surprising, as it is the consistent style of sectarians.

Outside the walls of "guns not allowed," their senses also seem extremely sharp: They can find terms to scold people arbitrarily; others are Ah Q, while they themselves are not ashamed to be Zhao Taiye from Weizhuang. But anyone with common sense clearly understands that Zhao Taiye is an even greater obstacle to history, instigating the local bullies to oppress the likes of Ah Q. Naturally, it cannot be denied that, despite having the status of Zhao Taiye, they dare not ignore the trends of the times and must also oppose feudalism. This allows them to become "experts" or "families" in anti-feudalism, a proprietary position. Even if there are one or two sentences that slightly touch on the sectarian nature of a fellow乡会, they will surely and fiercely slap a terrible label on others. This may be a "misunderstanding," but is it necessary for the literati of this time and place to adopt such an indiscriminate approach? This is still the mischief spawned by sectarianism.

In the Soviet Union, there was such an incident: In a certain factory, workers had different opinions on international understanding. One group emphasized the contradictions between imperialists, while another believed this was a defeatist view and used their power to expel the other group from the party and the industrial sector. The workers who were expelled were dissatisfied and wrote to the highest authorities to appeal. The authorities pointed out that those who were dissatisfied were correct, and their party membership and jobs were reinstated.

The above-mentioned abuse of power has a hint of sectarianism, which needs to be overcome by everyone.

Whether in politics or literature and art, the slogan of "clearing sectarianism" in the Soviet Union should not be accidental.

The path taken by sectarians is a "blind alley." Hitting a wall will lead to corruption, and surgery is necessary.

At this time and in this place, we must "expand" the clearing of sectarianism!

### Overnight Stay in a Dilapidated Temple

— Le Huan

——War Zone Diary on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway——

Less than three miles from Danyang City, we found a simple village god temple; it wasn't next to a village, which reduces the threat of daytime aircraft. We moved our luggage inside and a gust of evening wind came through, making us feel cold.

Stepping into the village god temple, a musty, damp odor rushed into our brains; it seemed that it had been abandoned for a long time. The window frames were broken and scattered, the front door was damaged, and the statues of the gods were piled high with a thick layer of dust...

After a hasty meal, fatigue entangled everyone. The comrades quickly opened their luggage and lay down on the thin straw. The wind invaded through the window frames, causing each comrade to curl up like a sleeping cat.

"Report!" A stout fist struck the incomplete temple door, emitting an annoying cracking sound, breaking the sweet dreams of every comrade.

On a cold early winter night, it was already difficult to find sweet dreams. Adding this unexpected surprise made us feel even more stunned.

The comrades poked their heads out from under their blankets. The starlight shone into the dilapidated temple. It was midnight, far from dawn!

Comrade × asked the orderly outside the door. He said, "The order is to depart for Shilipai in Jurong at four o'clock, and prepare everything by three thirty. It's already three o'clock now!" After speaking, a light and quick footstep gradually faded away.

As soon as we heard it was a night march, we immediately felt excited. We hurriedly put on our clothes and packed our luggage. The cooks worked even harder, rushing to bury the pot and cook rice.

Before the meal, the division headquarters sent a batch of cotton clothes. The comrades were even happier with this gift than with the meal. Each person chose a number that suited them, took off their unlined clothes, and put on the new clothes.

A wave of warmth made me naturally miss my kind mother in my hometown, and it increased my hatred for the wolves of the future.

It was time to eat, and I remembered that the only remaining candle had been burned out while cooking. So, we had to borrow the faint starlight. We opened the door wider to let more light in; the comrades felt a special interest in this novel way of eating.

The faint starlight could only barely capture the outline of the rice bowl, and we had to rely on our tongues to taste what was in it. The comrades' laughter continued until all the bowls were empty.

After the meal, we packed our luggage, said goodbye to the dilapidated temple, and stepped onto the Danyang-Jurong highway. The night blurred the surroundings of the highway, and the wilderness rested in silence.

The environment further increased our strong interest in rushing on, and each comrade had the thought of "getting most of the journey done before dawn." Our pace quickened a lot.

Sniffing the stimulating fresh cold air, we advanced on the smooth road; the rustling sound broke the silence around us.

### The Ross Institute

— (M.Ch.16)

Sir Ronald Ross died in the "Ross Hospital" on September 16, 1932. To thank the great scientist for his discoveries relating to the various problems of malaria, the whole world eulogized him. He struggled for malaria his entire life, thus making his name remain in the history of medical science, never to be erased.

Malaria, in ancient history, was also one of the most terrifying diseases. Only at the end of the previous century did mankind have a general understanding of this disease and how it is transmitted. Sir Ronald Ross discovered that the transmission of malaria is affected by a special type of mosquito. This poisonous mosquito is called "Anopheles." It sucks the blood of those suffering from malaria and absorbs the parasites in their blood, and can inject these parasites into the bodies of healthy people.

This invention can be regarded as the most significant of any new invention in the medical field, because after this discovery, the lives of hundreds of millions of people underwent a tremendous transformation. In fact, since then, the problem of malaria has become the problem that people are most determined to research.

The results of the research have yielded many extremely important results, but in any case, the research work is still continuing. The most important organization specializing in dealing with this problem is the Ross Institute in London. The institute relies purely on voluntary donations to maintain itself, but it is able to do its utmost to promote the work of researching malaria, and has already obtained the cooperation of several famous authorities on tropical diseases and the treatment of malaria, such as Watson and others.

Among the most important issues dealt with by the Ross Institute is providing quinine to the people suffering from the scourge of malaria. Later, the short-term quinine treatment method was greatly improved and established. This treatment method is regarded by the League of Nations Malaria Prevention Committee as the most appropriate treatment method, because the treatment period has gradually been reduced to five or seven days. During this period, only fifteen to eighteen grains of quinine need to be taken daily, and no other treatment is needed after recovery. However, if the old illness recurs, it can still be treated with the same method, and it will undoubtedly be cured. For prevention, the League of Nations Malaria Prevention Committee recommends taking six grains of quinine daily during the malaria-prone season, so that there will be no such problem.

The Ross Institute continues to implement the work of its founder in an effective way, without ever stopping.

### Tower

— Shi Weisi

The setting sun was far behind the mountains, stretching our two shadows long and swaying in the scattered clearings of the forest. Our steps were silent, as slow as an old man. What kind of dreamlike interest was it, facing the evening colors, thinking of things that had never been thought of before.

We stepped over the plank bridge, stepped onto the green path.

My friend is an intuitive lover, a young man recently bewildered by the pleasures of love. The bamboo forest and lake are buried with the shadows of his imagination. This surrounding area must be filled with his thoughts of unrequited love. Facing his entranced pupils, I wanted to tease him, but I struggled to think of a suitable word.

Suddenly, we stopped in one place. Broken tiles and ruined walls, overgrown with weeds, there was a towering tower, with the setting sun leaping on the top of the tower and the ruined walls, forming a special scene. The tower was not very high, but it was already able to look down upon all the ordinary small buildings on the ground. We were familiar with this place. One summer in the past, I lived in a small building very close to this tower. The lonely life made me feel quite bored. Today, I feel that looking at the wilderness under the tower in the evening breeze of June has another good meaning.

My friend, not knowing where he thought of it from, said,

"Do you remember the Tang Dynasty poem: 'The tower's momentum is like surging out, solitary and tall, towering over the great palace'?"

"Exactly this scenery!" I said. But what I thought of was that it was a pity that it was already a ruined tower.

It must have been when I was very, very young, I came out of a mountain village. Now, the small village built on the ridge floats before my eyes again. When I was young, I was a brisk walker, completely different from now. I loved to climb mountains, climb to the top of the tower, and look down on the rising smoke from the village below. What evokes my memory of that small village the most, even now, is that small pagoda. It is said that in my ancestors' time, one day, a flood occupied the entire village and fields. For three days and three nights, suddenly a tower surged up on the earthen mountain. In a burst of thunder, the evil spirit that caused the flood was suppressed under the tower, and the water subsided.

Several times, I wanted to redraw a contour from my imagination for the town-guarding tower of my long-separated mountain village. There should be dozens of believers surrounding it, worshiping and offering incense and prayers, right?

"Two towers, two different destinies!" Yes, you see that the tower in the city is withering and peeling off in loneliness, accompanied by desolate mountains and ruined ruins, letting the traces of wind and rain mark the shadow of constant years!

At this point, my friend suddenly stopped his lofty emotion, and his surprised eyes fell on me. You can imagine his nervous energy, a soul bewitched by the embracing mountains and rivers, as if he had to sing an ancient poem to express his own insignificance!

"You seem to have a meditation. Do you mean there is another tower?"

"Everyone has a tower in their heart," but I thought this was a sorrow. I told my story. "Human interest is built on towers. If you return to my mountain village, you will see that group of devout men and women surrounding the tower, paying homage and worshiping. That tower of faith is actually more magnificent and solid than the tower that surged up from the earthen mountain. They found the joy of life and all the shadows of imagination there! So many things in this society have changed because of this. But one day, the tower of faith collapsed, collapsing terribly. You see, peeling off and desolate, that's how some people's confidence is!"

Silent pupils. I seemed to hear a crisp sound. Whose seven-treasure pagoda made of colored glaze in their heart had collapsed again?

Stepping on the shadow of the new moon, the setting sun disappeared behind the western mountains. Suddenly sad, listening to the distant sound of the washerwoman's mallet, both of us thought of going home at the same time.

### After Talk

I hope that those who are concerned about our country's culture will all make an effort to go and see it. The recently published "Literary Renaissance" contains a special feature on the Language Exhibition, written by Chen Wangdao, Xu Jingsong, Ding Fubao and others, which can be used as a reference.

### Song of the Mountain Maple

— Hui He

The sound of marching hooves shattered the tranquility of the autumn mountains,

The solemn mountain maple trembled with an earthen heart;

Saying goodbye to its old branches in the bleak wind,

Each leaf was trampled into ashes by iron hooves.

The maple leaves on the branches did not show any signs of dejection,

Their crimson faces were more radiant than in the past:

They were dyed with the blood of heroes,

And grew so majestic from the atmosphere of gunpowder.

Accustomed to the clamor of bugle calls,

The glint of swords and shadows of spears mingled in the sunlight;

Knowing that dying in this way is not a waste of life,

Since ancient times, which hero has not staked his head!

The rustling sound startled the autumn wind's high spirits,

The sound of horses' hooves changed from chaotic to quiet;

Faintly, there was the flute music of a shepherdess,

And a solemn smile of victory appeared on the crimson face.

### Shirley Temple Stars in Her First Romance Movie

— Xin Fang

Not long ago, a film review contained these words: "In Hollywood, it has become a trend to tailor-make scripts to accommodate an actor's acting skills." This approach can also be said to cater to the audience's psychology. But if this continues for a long time, I think the result will still be that they will be rejected. The content of Shirley Temple's previous films mainly focused on singing and dancing. Although she caused a sensation throughout the silver screen, recently, due to her increasing age, these childish actions have finally been despised by audiences. Hollywood producers have also seen this. In her new film "Susannah of the Mounties," the director added some love scenes in addition to singing and dancing. This is Shirley Temple's first time acting in a romance film! When she performs love scenes, I wonder what she feels in her heart!

It is also worth mentioning that in the film, there is a scene where Shirley Temple smokes a pipe. Some readers must feel rare to see how she can smoke at such a young age. It turns out that the pipe she uses was specially made by the engineer who arranged the grand fire scene in the final scene of "The Great Chicago Fire." It looks like she is smoking, but the smoke does not enter her mouth at all.

### Two New Dances in Hollywood

— Hua Zhi

Recently, two new types of social dances have become popular in Hollywood and New York, and men and women are extremely enthusiastic about them. The famous "Social Dance Teachers College" in Southern California regards these two dance styles as compulsory courses. At the recent "National Dance Association" held in New York, President An Naiyang also announced: American social dance has entered a new stage, with all the old and stale elements gone, and everything has a fresh start.

The so-called two new dances, one named "Polk Orando," is supported by the heel and toe, with the whole body rotating as the main movement. The movements are very slow, the rhythm is even, and the music is sweeter than other dance styles. There are many tricks interspersed in the rotation, which is actually an evolution of combining the strengths of various dance styles. The other is called "Boomps-A-Daisy," which has a relaxed and humorous form, which is to replace the "Rumbas" dance steps that were lively for a while, but the expressions of both parties are even more advanced. When dancing, the male and female dance partners first clap each other's palms, then clap their own knees, and then their bodies rotate endlessly. During the rotation, the man "accidentally" bumps into the other's body, and the woman turns her face back, making a white eye and a surprised look. The music stops abruptly, and the situation is slightly tense. Finally, the man bows his head to apologize, the woman turns her anger into joy, the music resumes, and the two dance partners cooperate again, making free dance styles at will.

The inventors of the Boomps-A-Daisy are the famous dancers Amber and his wife from Texas.

### Recommending New Play "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty"

— Ti Gong

At this time and in this place, to actually see something like this, how could one not be both surprised and delighted?

Lying on my pillow, I couldn't fall asleep anymore. A wave of heat rose in my body. When Nen Niang spat out blood from her mouth, the blood all over my body was like a pot of boiling water, and it hadn't calmed down until now.

I love Nen Niang, I love Mei Niang, and I love Ma Jinzi even more, this innocent girl "Ma Jin, who offers gold when mounting a horse, and the son of 儿子"!

Zhou Xinfang has in his mouth "A courtesan does not know the sorrow of national subjugation, still singing 'Backyard Flower' across the river." Nen Niang also has these two lines in her mouth, and even Cai Ruheng shouts these two lines in his mouth, but what is given to the audience are three different responses.

Up to this point, it seems that there has never been a work in Peking Opera that is more meaningful than "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." However, Mr. Wei Ruhui's new work is undoubtedly at least ten times more powerful than the former.

The reason for this is that the distance between Chongzhen and our common people is a little more distant. But we can be Sun Ke Xian, we can be Ge Nen Niang, and at the very least, we can be a Ma Jinzi.

I respectfully extend my highest respect to all the gentlemen and ladies of the Shanghai Drama Society. I recommend this masterpiece, which absolutely cannot be missed, to all the ladies and gentlemen in Shanghai with fervent enthusiasm. I also warmly hope that a few Peking Opera critics will make an exception to see the drama "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" and, in addition to the sounds, tunes, gestures, and words, discover a little new sprout and bring it back to sow in the garden of Peking Opera.

### Air Raid Theater in London

— Hua Zhi

After the outbreak of the European War, although the UK vigorously implemented air defense and dispersed the metropolitan population, most of it did not change much. Among public entertainment activities, only horse racing and champagne competitions were banned, while other football matches, circuses, movies, etc., continued to operate as usual. Most of the modernized theaters in London have air defense facilities. Among them, the famous Golden Blue Circus is arranged very carefully, with male and female receptionists wearing gas masks, and there is also a hospital inside that can provide first aid to viewers at any time. In front of general cinemas, it is also grandly indicated: "Modern equipment, safe and secure, if you don't believe it, come and try it."

The films shown in various theaters mainly focus on being light and avoiding stimulation. However, the heroic situation of the air force is also promoted. The UK's first war film this year, named "The Lion has Wings," stars actor Lee Richardson as the flying general and actress Merle Oberon as the affectionate nurse, highlighting the magnificent spirit of the British Air Force.

The "Prelude to the German-Polish War," a film produced by the propaganda department of the German Nazi Party, is also being screened in London. It was originally a self-bragging film by the German army, but unexpectedly, due to poor propaganda techniques, it instead advertised the brave Poles everywhere.

Since there are various jokes on the screen and safety equipment underground, there is no fear of enemy aircraft coming to attack, so the air raid theater business is very lively. The police department has now stipulated that the opening hours of London theaters can be extended from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm, which is even more convenient for general movie fans.

The "Jia Diao" of Old Male and Old Female Roles

After this renovation and significant improvements to the stage, there is one thing that is highly praised by the opera circles: among the first batch of new actors, the old female role Li Duokui is particularly outstanding. Not only can she refresh the ears and eyes of opera enthusiasts in Shanghai, but Li's ability to draw audiences accounts for more than one-third of the entire group. This was truly beyond the expectations of those who invited her. Examining the motive, it was because five or six years ago, when Du Junju first went north to invite actors, I (the author) was in Beijing, and I met with Duokui daily. I recommended Li to Du and settled on a package fee of 1,300 yuan with a single word. After coming south, her performance was quite good. This time, Du and the owner of Meihua Hall were again tasked with inviting actors for the renovation. Not knowing the drawing power of Wu Suqiu and others, for the sake of experience, they invited this only inheritor of the Gong school to come along. The package fee was only slightly increased by a few hundred yuan. Unexpectedly, after the opening, Li's popularity was particularly strong. Sometimes, within a single section, every line she sang was well-received, breaking previous records. Firstly, because Duokui's voice is loud and clear, and her pitch is high, even those on the second floor can hear it distinctly. Secondly, because Li never slacks off. In all the plays, wherever the "jia diao" should be used, she always exerts her full strength, emitting a powerful and solid sound from her diaphragm. With a loud shout, the entire audience is startled. The so-called "thunderbolt in clear sky" is truly enough to awaken the deaf and invigorate the spirit.

Note: "Jia diao" is limited to old male roles, martial old male roles, red-faced male roles, and old female roles who use their natural voice. If female roles, young male roles, or painted-face roles who use falsetto or altered voices, they cannot use "jia diao." Furthermore, "jia diao" has soft, hard, and semi-"jia diao" distinctions. At the same time, there are differences in the difficulty of using it in Erhuang and Xipi tunes. (135)
