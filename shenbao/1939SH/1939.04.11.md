Doctors say that his injuries are serious, but not hopeless. The identity of the assassin remains unknown, and the assassination appears to have been carefully planned. It is widely believed that the motive for the assassination was that Chen was a "traitor."

### British Ambassador's Trip to Chongqing Sparks Speculation Again

(Chongqing) Today, rumors are circulating here that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is coming to Chongqing with a preliminary plan to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. Sir Archibald is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today. Official circles here do not attach much importance to this rumor, saying that Sir Archibald's trip to Chongqing is a routine matter. The Central Government's attitude towards peace and war has not changed, and the only possible path to peace is for Japan to respect China's territory and sovereignty. According to reliable sources, Britain is indeed eager for the war in the Far East to end immediately, as Chamberlain wants to concentrate his efforts on dealing with the Central European situation and does not want to attend to both European and Asian disputes.

### Chinese Army in Hubei Advances, Recaptures Important Strongholds, Beijing-Zhongxiang-Hankou-Yichang Roads Cut Off, Japanese Army Dispirited, on the Verge of Collapse

Editorial

### The Mediterranean Crisis and Collective Security

Amid the piecemeal advances of Germany and Italy and the gradual concessions of Britain and France, tragic and shocking events continue to unfold in Europe. We have witnessed the demise of Czechoslovakia, the seizure of Memel, the strangulation of the Spanish Republic, the oppression of Romania, the threats against Poland... Not many days later, we saw that the key to the Adriatic Sea—Albania—had disappeared from the map of Europe under the trampling hooves of the Blackshirts. The dreamlike tragedy of "national subjugation in three days" has, in the 1940s, become commonplace!

The Axis of German-Italian aggression appears to have reached a high point today, and is still developing. This newspaper has pointed out that any claims of German-Italian contradiction are unfounded today; we have also pointed out that the German-Italian axis, due to the increasing sharpness of its internal contradictions, will inevitably intensify its attacks on Britain and France. These words have "unfortunately come true." Not many days after the fall of Czechoslovakia, Albania fell into the hands of Mussolini. While Mussolini's "lightning" seizure of Albania could be seen as a response to Hitler's expansion in Central and Southeastern Europe, we agree more with the view in American political circles that "Italy's invasion of Albania is a coordinated action by Germany and Italy"; this was made very clear in yesterday's Havas dispatch: "Germany and Italy seem to have drawn up an entire plan, allowing Italy to launch the first attack on Albania, with Germany providing material assistance, and then dividing Europe, with Albania and Greece falling within Italy's sphere of influence, and Yugoslavia and Spain being placed under Italy's control in a more indirect way politically and under Germany's control economically. At the same time, Germany will expand into Eastern Europe, with Poland becoming the "primary enemy"... As for Romania, it is already being pressured by Germany." From the above passage, one can see the completeness of the German-Italian plan to redivide Europe, and understand the coordinated nature of Fascist aggression.

Hitler's advances have caused the map of Central Europe to change color piece by piece. Mussolini's rampage has stirred up dangerous waves in the Mediterranean. The danger to the British and French positions in the Mediterranean has never been as great as it is today. The British and French rulers harmed the Spanish Republic and are now reaping the bitter fruit of their actions. Chamberlain and his ilk, relying on the power of London finance, pulled Franco over from the German-Italian side, but what are the facts today? Italian troops are pouring into Spain to strengthen their control; Franco also joined the Anti-Comintern Pact on the 7th of this month. Spain has become Fascist Spain. This is another crisis in the Mediterranean.

On the other hand, the seizure of Albania has compensated for Italy's lack of resources. The oil there is urgently needed by her, and the oil wells in Berat are in her development plans. But the greatest benefit of controlling Albania is that it allows her to control the entire Adriatic Sea, strengthening Italy's military strategic position. With Albania, Italy can take Greece in the east, threaten British communications in the eastern Mediterranean, and even peer into the Near East. To maintain its lifeline in the eastern Mediterranean, Britain must cooperate with Greece. Today, Fascist forces have penetrated deep into Greece. According to a recent article by a reporter for the British Labour Monthly (Antroposof), there is a danger that Greece under Metaxas may become the "Franco Spain" of the eastern Mediterranean, which will undoubtedly become Britain's greatest concern.

After Albania was invaded by Italy, Greece is in great danger. In addition to sending warships to the eastern Mediterranean to maintain a vigil, Britain will also decide to conclude bilateral agreements with Greece and Turkey to guarantee them. However, from the "German-Italian joint plan to redivide Europe," we feel that local guarantees are insufficient to prevent the increasingly expanding provocations of Fascist aggressors. The threat of German and Italian aggressors is deepening day by day, which has already promoted a more active British attitude towards anti-aggression. But Chamberlain still lacks confidence in collective security. When Poland is in danger, he hastily concludes a mutual assistance agreement with Poland; when Greece and Turkey are in danger, he again hastily decides to guarantee them. In fact, the ink on the Anglo-Polish agreement is not yet dry, and the Albanian tragedy has followed. Even if the security of Greece and Turkey can be guaranteed locally, how can we be sure that aggression will not occur elsewhere? Therefore, we must reiterate that peace is indivisible, and security is collective. It is necessary to link together the international guarantees of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and even the Far East as a whole. In other words, it is necessary to expand local international guarantees into common international guarantees, so that all peace-loving countries can unite to establish a collective security system, which will be able to stop Fascist aggression and achieve genuine peace.

### Wu Jingheng Writes an Article Criticizing Wang Jingwei: "Giving One Example" Reveals State Secrets, Exploiting One's Position and Authority Should Be Severely Punished

(Chongqing) Wu Jingheng's further explanation of Wang Jingwei's "giving one example," the full text is as follows: I haven't heard any news of Wang Jingwei for a long time. Since the shocking news report that Mr. Hui Zhongming was brutally murdered by patriotic overseas Chinese, a poem and an article have been sent to me by a friend in Hong Kong. In the poem, Wang's passivity is excessive, and I have already followed his rhyme and explained it. The article was published after Mr. Zeng's death, mainly fearing that one day it would be exposed and he would be accused of being a traitor, misunderstanding his painstaking efforts to advocate peace, to justify himself, and to plead for Mr. Zeng. Alas, Wang's situation is indeed very embarrassing. I only hope that from now on, Wang will only have the major error of the "flamboyant telegram" being reckless and unchecked, and will never end up acting out a scene of betraying the country for personal gain. Then, a gentleman's fault is like a solar eclipse, and everyone sees it. Wang's glorious history will not end up being thrown into the latrine, and it can also greatly comfort his friend Mr. Zeng in the afterlife. However, as soon as Wang's article appeared in the Nanhua Daily, rumors and news spread, such as Gao Chongwu's situation, the welcoming in Tokyo, and the secret negotiations in Hanoi. Now I have to make another concession. This matter is due to the oversensitivity of journalists. However, important figures lightly expressing their opinions is almost as likely to cause trouble as the "flamboyant telegram." Looking back at Wang's sudden trip south last winter, before the "flamboyant telegram" was sent, I personally fell into a fog, completely confused. Wang Jingwei was a devout follower of Sun Yat-sen's original teachings and the vice president of the party. He should share the fate of the party and should not desert his post when the enemy was frantically bombing Chongqing, fleeing to a safe place. If I had suspected that he had other intentions at that time, how could I dare to judge a gentleman with the heart of a villain? But I simply thought he was too tired and wanted a short rest, which seemed inappropriate. Therefore, I thought of his wife, Chen Bijun, as a heroine, whose headdress was even more flamboyant, so I sent a quick letter to Hanoi. The text is as follows: "Madam Bijun, respectfully. Mr. Jingwei has recently been in Chongqing, presiding over dozens of meetings every week and giving dozens of speeches. In addition, he is busy with telegrams and receiving guests, with hardly any rest day or night. I expected him to fall ill, and now he is indeed ill and taking a short rest, hoping to recover soon and face greater difficulties, which is what everyone hopes. However, the actions of important figures are easily exploited by enemy spies and rumors. At this time, we are only in the early stages of the war of resistance, fighting the strong with the weak, concentrating our main force, and waiting for the enemy to exhaust themselves and penetrate deeply to encircle them. This is the common belief of the whole country and the national policy determined by 450 million people. Therefore, on the night of leaving Nanjing the year before last, I planned to retreat to the mountains, which you and Mr. Jingwei, along with all the attendees of the highest meeting, advocated. I suffered huge losses, just to make them bogged down and eager to lure their elite troops to come again. This is like a sumo wrestler who is exhausted and hoarse, while the Tai Chi master is about to deliver a fatal blow, but instead allows them to rest. Isn't this like Yue Fei's twelve gold tablets, causing the world to laugh and curse for eternity? Since ancient times, there has been no country that has not fallen, and no one who has not died. People have personality, and countries have national character. It is a disgrace to the nation for people to be lured to death and for countries to be lured to destruction. You assisted Mr. Jingwei in attacking Zaifeng in Beijing. For thirty years, you have been as bright as Liang Hongyu, admired by the whole country. 'Drawing a knife to achieve a quick death, not betraying the head of a young man' – everyone believes that the face of an elder is more precious than the head of a young man. Mr. Jingwei is ill and unable to attend to foreign affairs. I hope you will quickly clear up this stain so that a true person will forever appear in the world. I know you will do it soon. I venture to add a word, and I also hope that Mr. Jingwei will recover soon. Your younger brother, Wu Jingheng, bows his head, December 25th." I don't know that when this letter arrived in Hanoi, Wang had already sent a flamboyant telegram to Hong Kong. What is even more strange is that on the 26th memorial week, Chairman Chiang had already thoroughly refuted the fallacies issued by Konoe on the 22nd, which was published at home and abroad. How could Wang not know this? Why did he publish his flamboyant telegram on the 29th? Apart from trying to speculate with the enemy and shake people's hearts, there is no other explanation. It is appropriate that the whole country is indignant and the whole party hates him. I am anxious and say that Wang is asking for trouble. Even in small matters, there are more martyrs like Wen Shengcai outside the country today. Indeed, Lin Baisheng was attacked before, and Mr. Zeng Zhongming was killed after. These senseless sacrifices are all caused by careless words and deeds. After the fact, he tried his best to remedy the situation and came up with "giving one example," but the more he talked, the more confused he became. As the ancients said, "Once a word is spoken, it is hard to take back even with a team of horses." Isn't that true? Wang, a gentleman's fault is like a solar eclipse, and everyone sees it. If he does not become a traitor in the end, everyone will admire him, and filial sons and grandsons will definitely misinterpret it for him, saying that he was merely unwise in his words, proving that he had no other intentions. Since he gave one example, I should provide a further explanation.

(1) Wang's decisive advocacy of peace is not his personal matter. He disclosed the records of the highest national defense meeting, which is revealing diplomatic and military secrets. The law has clear punishments for this, and since he was the chairman of the meeting at the time, exploiting his own position and authority to leak secrets, the punishment should be even more severe. Wang himself knows this ("It is necessary to strictly keep secrets for the sake of national interests"). Fortunately, the disclosure of the secrets and the changed words at the time are no different from him announcing his own crimes. The enemy still does not dare to use the details of the German ambassador's discussion of the armistice and the diplomatic secrets for propaganda, and even Ambassador Tao has not revealed any of them abroad. Wang considers that he is not free to express his personal opinions in Chongqing. However, since he has left Chongqing and is in a free place, why not send a secret telegram to the central government as a personal suggestion, but instead publish it in Hong Kong first? Therefore, the people of the country hate you not for openly criticizing your personal views, but for despising you for leaking state secrets, seeking the enemy's trust, undermining the interests of the war of resistance, and satisfying personal desires for propaganda. At this critical moment of the war of resistance, when the survival of the nation hangs in the balance, when the officers and soldiers at the front and the people of the whole country are risking their lives to kill the enemy and striving for final victory, it is intolerable by national law and human sentiment for any individual to publicly propagate their opinions without offering them to the government. How much more so when you were the chairman at the time? Therefore, Wang's decisive advocacy of peace or not advocating peace is just a kind of twisted argument. I dare say that the crime of publicly counter-propagating is that you, in addition to speculating on surrendering to the enemy, wanting to be a puppet, and shaking people's hearts, wanting to achieve the goal of national subjugation, what other explanation is there?

(2) Regarding the issue of peace or war, Wang's observation has been a constant mistake. Isn't there a clear and insightful passage from Chiang Kai-shek in the secret diplomatic talks he disclosed? It is that "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressed to the German ambassador that he does not trust Japan, that Japan can tear up treaties and that words do not count." Also, according to the German ambassador, the conditions of Japan at that time already clearly contained "If a new regime is established in North China in the future, it should be allowed to exist," etc., which was insidiously included. If Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had not proposed two demanding conditions in response to this proposal the year before last, even if the good intentions of the German ambassador had been realized, it would have been no different from Prime Minister Chamberlain falling into the trap of others, advising to cede the Sudetenland. In less than half a year, he was bound hand and foot and offered the entire country. Wang does not know what kind of anesthetic liquor he has drunk. In the "giving one example" document, he said, "The conditions stated by the German ambassador regarding the Japanese side were not so clearly demarcated and were even more harsh than this." Could this mean that they did not want reparations, did not want to cede land, and cancelled the concessions, etc.? Isn't Konoe deceiving the ignorant with many self-confessed sarcastic words? Even if one has not read Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's detailed refutation, even elementary school students understand that "economic cooperation" means that all of China's money belongs to them, and that "mixed residence in the interior" means that the whole country becomes a concession and China's land also belongs to them. Why would they need reparations, why would they need to cede land, why would they need concessions? Why are such conditions for national subjugation understood by elementary school students, but Wang pretends not to understand, taking red dog feces as tinder and blowing on it? As long as I am asked to defend Wang, saying that this is only a function, who would believe that it is not because he is blinded by profit? Therefore, a friend from Hong Kong wrote to tell me that the heroine Wang admires, Wang's wife, was fortunate enough to be among her (comrades) and listened to her secret instructions. She analyzed, "We will not hesitate to start a civil war to overthrow him and make peace, so that Mr. Wang can come out to organize the 'central government' and the country will not be subjugated." This kind of insane, husband-following-wife behavior is simply daydreaming. Wang also lists, "When Konoe made the statement, Nanjing, Jinan, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Anqing, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Wuhan had already fallen, while Changsha had not yet fallen, but had already been burned to the ground. Peace talks cannot be conducted." At that time, I saw Wang after the fall of Guangzhou, as if he had lost his parents, stamping his feet and wailing. I thought Wang had an anger greater than hatred towards the enemy country, making it difficult to face his ancestors. How could I know that he was regretting that his surrender was too late? The changes in great figures are truly beyond the comprehension of us lowly people. Perhaps he deeply believed that the Czechoslovakia after the cession of the Sudetenland would be able to achieve long-term stability, so he also shared the national policy with us. We Chinese had no choice but to endure the pain of exchanging many key points from Nanjing to Wuhan for the exhaustion of the enemy, making them eager to negotiate peace and wanting us to cease fire and rest, while our officers and soldiers at the front and the people of the whole country were risking their lives to implement the consistent policy of long-term resistance. Just when we were reaching a turning point, Wang forgot that he thought that the more cities the enemy occupied, the more vigorously they slaughtered our compatriots, and the faster we should surrender to the enemy and the more demanding the conditions should be. Are you making such crazy statements to promote the enemy or to bargain with your own country on behalf of the enemy? With such a fear of the enemy, no wonder you were afraid of the enemy's bombing of Chongqing and were about to fly to the safe zone of Hanoi abroad, hurriedly responding to the enemy country's Prime Minister Konoe and establishing the "national subjugation conditions" of the "New Order in East Asia." You are actually going to send up the opportunity to rest and recuperate that we exchanged for the precious lives of the entire nation to the enemy and ask for peace, letting them rest and recuperate. When the enemy rests for half a year, when our people's hearts are scattered and our military affairs are lax, wouldn't it be ten times easier for them to sweep through our southwest again than it is today? After half a year, wouldn't the entire China become Czechoslovakia, and wouldn't you become the puppet president Hacha who organized the "central government"? Even elementary school students understand this, but Wang and his wife pretend not to understand. If you want me to explain the reason, it is nothing more than envy for Puyi, Yin Rugeng, Hacha, etc., who, although they are puppets in name, are third-class slaves. The ambitious people of the three northeastern provinces would rather be displaced north and south to this day, knowing that protecting the country as a loyal subject is even more difficult than being a slave of a subjugated country. Therefore, Wang and his wife want to persuade the Hong Kong business community and the young students to surrender. I believe that our Hong Kong compatriots would rather sell matches in Hong Kong than follow Wang to Nanjing to be loyal subjects, because as soon as he encounters compatriots who have fled from the occupied areas of the three northeastern provinces and slightly talks about the small flavors of "bowing" and "slapping," he cannot help but hope to take advantage of the enemy's exhaustion and fight to the end to seek escape from death.

(3) There are three questions in Wang's "giving one example," and the above explanations are enough to answer the first two questions. His third question is, "When the German ambassador was mediating, the people at the highest national defense meeting, whether in Nanjing or Wuhan, all had the same views. Why did they have different views when Konoe made the statement?" It is unbelievable that such an extremely intelligent person like Wang would ask such a foolish question. Before I answer your question directly, let me ask you why Wu Zhihui, who has always wanted to respect you and value you, earnestly begged you to be cautious day and night with Mr. Li Shizeng and others on April 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of the 16th year, but you suddenly issued a declaration with Mr. Chen Duxiu, the leader of the Communist Party at the time, on the 4th, and I impolitely scolded you wildly. Later, you finally realized your mistake, and you still think it was a big mistake to this day, whether it was a big mistake or not, or whether your nerves were oversensitive. As for the mistake at the time, your self-awareness was indeed correct, so I respected you as before. In December of that year, you suddenly had another strange idea, and I, along with Mr. Li Shizeng and Mr. Zhang Puquan, advised you to be cautious. Mr. Zhang even begged you, but you didn't listen. On the 12th, when Guangzhou was burned and plundered, I had no choice but to scold you again. You left the country in tears. Later, you felt that "Although I did not kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren died because of me," and you returned to the party and the country with renewed importance, and I respected you until now. Unexpectedly, you, like the "prostitute politicians" and "shaking elements" criticized by the Communist Party, have come up with another flamboyant telegram. Naturally, we cannot agree with your request to surrender. Mr. Zhang even regretted that he should not have risked embracing the assassin in front of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, saving a useless person. Answering you with the above history, it is natural for people to have the same views as you in the past. If you really become a puppet, I am afraid that your promising children will not recognize you, the old traitor, as their parents. Therefore, your confidential secretary, the most trusted confidant, because of his conscience, actually wanted to leak your secrets. We truly feel sorry for Comrade Zeng Zhongming, because we have lost a truly loyal comrade who worked for the public and not for private gain. I will now answer you directly. You use the tone of a rogue, hypnosis, and push people to say that since they have already advocated war, they should not "advocate peace." Who said that advocating war should not advocate peace again? War is not a major national policy, but Mr. Wang should know that the peace you are talking about is the peace you are seeking under the treaty of "establishing a new order in East Asia" on December 22nd of last year. Don't you know that the "new order in East Asia" is the "Japan-Manchukuo-China Cooperation"? Isn't that just a new term for "Japan annexing China"? Isn't this condition a "national subjugation condition"? Isn't your advocacy of peace a surrender? Can it still be called making peace? Can such a surrender still be called a major national policy? Isn't such peace-making a betrayal of the country? How can you blame people for having different views from you on this kind of surrender and betrayal of the country? Even elementary school students can distinguish the principles of right and wrong, interests and harms, war and survival. Is it true that such an intelligent person like you does not know this? Are you still arguing about peace or war, talking about a fool's dream, or is there another purpose? Speaking of the main point, you should understand that if you are planning for the country in good faith and using proper procedures, such as the highest national defense meeting, to secretly contribute to the issue of war and peace, people will naturally discuss it with you. If they find it inappropriate, they can reject it, just like the Nanjing peace talks were not mentioned again. If you had personally submitted your 29th telegram to the party headquarters for everyone to discuss, everyone would have at most advised you not to have foolish dreams and would have rejected it. But you openly went out and openly announced it, as malicious propaganda. You have already committed a capital crime and are hoping to become a traitor. Who would agree with your rebellious plot, who is innocent and loves and remembers the country? Isn't it utterly foolish to ask why "they would have different views"? The above is my further explanation, which can be considered concise and to the point. However, I hope that Wang will rein in his horse at the edge of the cliff. There are still a few small issues that I want to advise on (to be continued tomorrow).

### British Newspaper Publishes Headlines about Chinese Military Victories

(London) This morning, all the newspapers published prominent news about the great victory of the Chinese army's counter-offensive. It is said that the result of the Chinese army's counter-offensive has completely foiled the Japanese army's attempts to attack Changsha and Wuzhou. It is expected that the Chinese army will launch a larger-scale general counter-offensive in the near future. (Quick News Agency, 9th)

### British Ship Seized and Forced to Sail to Taiwan

(Hong Kong) It was learned today that the British ship "Siggs" was seized by a Japanese warship on April 8th while en route from Xiamen to Fuzhou and forced to sail to Taiwan to await investigation into whether the ship had the right to fly the national flag. Upon hearing this, the British flagship "Ceres" immediately sailed to Shantou to protest to the Japanese naval authorities. According to the Wheelock Marden & Co., Ltd., the ship had been chartered by the Douglas Steamship Company two years ago. The ship was carrying salt from Xiamen to Fuzhou. It is expected that it will be released soon. (Associated Press, 10th)

(Hong Kong) The merchant ship "Siggs" of the British company Jardine Matheson was detained by the Japanese side when it left Hong Kong for Fujian last week and was taken to the Penghu Islands. It has not yet been released. (10th)

### British Mediterranean Fleet's Actions are Secret - Italy Offers Another Guarantee to Britain - Saying It Still Wishes to Maintain Albania's Independence - Mussolini's Visit to Tirana is Abruptly Cancelled

(London) According to sources here, the British Mediterranean Fleet warships that visited Italian ports all left their anchorages on the 8th of this month. Among them, the fleet commander's flagship, the "Warspite," sailed from Sanremo. The destination of each ship has not been officially announced, but it is explained that given the chaotic situation in Albania, the withdrawal of the visiting Italian ships may avoid troubles for all parties concerned. (Reuters, 10th)

Nice, France - The British 31,000-ton battleship "Malaya," which was originally anchored in Menton Harbor, suddenly sailed out last night, and its destination is unknown. (Havas, 10th)

(London) The British Admiralty today firmly denied the rumors circulating abroad that the British Mediterranean Fleet has concentrated off Corfu Island and the Greek coast. (Reuters, 10th)

(Paris) Regarding the Albanian affair, British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine informed Foreign Minister Bonnet this morning that the Italian government had formally provided assurances that it would maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean, as well as the independence of Albania, and that it had no intention of infringing upon Greece and its affiliated island of Corfu. In the view of diplomatic circles, the international situation has eased slightly, and the Anglo-Italian Agreement may not be declared invalid. However, diplomatic negotiations between the countries concerned are proceeding tirelessly. Foreign Minister Bonnet is still staying in the capital, closely monitoring the international situation, and will meet with Soviet Ambassador Suritz to exchange views on the formation of an anti-aggression alliance in Eastern Europe. (Havas, 10th)

(London) Italian Chargé d'Affaires Croala visited Foreign Secretary Halifax today and made firm assurances about the limited nature of the country's actions in Albania. Today, due to some rumors, Foreign Secretary Halifax and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Croala held three meetings. According to responsible sources, the Foreign Secretary clearly stated to the Italian Chargé d'Affaires that the British government had serious concerns about Italy's actions in Albania and that the British people were very angry about this matter. The British authorities have taken considerable note of the assurances given by the Italian Chargé d'Affaires and have notified the British Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, of the general situation of the Foreign Secretary's repeated meetings with the Italian Chargé d'Affaires. At present, people's worries about the situation may have decreased slightly compared to this morning. The authorities have not made any comments on the impact of Italy's actions in Albania on British policy. British Minister to Albania Knight has sent several telegrams from Durrës, proving that he is safe. The news from the responsible authorities above is sufficient to indicate that general concerns have been slightly alleviated. (Reuters, 9th)

(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini was originally scheduled to travel to Tirana, the capital of Albania, today to deliver an important speech, but if the weather is bad, it will be postponed. Well-informed sources here recently announced that this trip has been cancelled, but the reason is not the weather, but the international reaction caused by Italy's use of troops in Albania. Diplomatic negotiations are underway in many ways. Prime Minister Mussolini wants to wait and see how the negotiations turn out before deciding what to do. (Havas, 10th)

(London) Responsible sources here recently announced that Italian Chargé d'Affaires Croala has firmly assured Foreign Secretary Halifax that the country does not intend to take any action against the Greek island of Corfu and is willing to provide the same assurance to the Greek government. The British government is satisfied with this assurance. However, under this situation, it is not yet known whether the British government will provide security guarantees to Greece as soon as possible, or wait until the negotiations on the general nature of the security issues in Central and Eastern Europe have achieved success before doing so. (Havas, 10th)

(Rome) French Ambassador to Italy Lord Perth visited Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon to inquire about news of the Albanian affair. Ciano gave a full explanation. People here believe that the establishment of a purely Albanian administrative committee in Tirana to govern the country shows that Italy has no intention of declaring Albania a part of its empire. Italian officials have declared the news of the annexation of Albania to be intentional rumors, completely unfounded. Non-official circles believe that Italy will not make a decision for the time being, waiting for the reaction of Britain, France, and the world to Italy's occupation of Albania. At the same time, Gayda published an article in the Italian newspaper today, saying that if Britain believes that Italy's actions are undermining the Anglo-Italian Agreement, it is free to do so, and Italy will adjust its future attitude accordingly. The meaning of this statement is that if Britain abandons the agreement, it may prompt Italy to immediately declare Albania its territory. Judging from the current situation, Italy seems to be about to declare Albania its mandate. (Reuters, 9th)

### France Convenes National Defense Conference – Exceptionally Important in Nature

(Paris) The Standing Committee on National Defense held a meeting at the Ministry of War this month at 5 PM and adjourned at 7 PM. Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, Minister of Aviation La Chambre, Chief of the General Staff General Gamelin, Deputy Chief of the Army Staff General Colson, Inspector General of Colonial Troops General Pujo, Chief of the Air Force Staff General Vuillemin, Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff Rear Admiral Platon, Chief Secretary to the Premier General de Gaulle, Minister of Foreign Affairs Bonnet, and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Léger, all attended. No official statement was released afterward. It is generally believed that this meeting was exceptionally important in nature. Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet also met with British Ambassador Sir Phipps for half an hour after the meeting, but the content of their discussion remains unknown. Furthermore, the cabinet is scheduled to meet at 4 PM on the 11th of this month, and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to meet at 4 PM on the 12th. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(Paris) Local newspapers continue to comment on the international situation and publish many special dispatches from correspondents stationed abroad. A small newspaper carried a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating, "Germany's Siegfried Line in the west, which Germans have always boasted about to the world, was actually hastily completed in a few months. France's Maginot Line, on the other hand, has been under construction for many years and has now been completed. Bohemia in Czechoslovakia also has defensive works, but they are only a rough outline compared to the scale of the Maginot Line. Recently, German army generals went to inspect it and were astonished. From this, it can be seen that the quality of the defensive works of France and Germany is worlds apart. It is ridiculous that Germany's boastful exaggerations have led the world to compare this superficial Siegfried Line with the Maginot Line." The "Action" newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party reported, "General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, will soon go to Madrid in the spirit of a victor and deliver a speech outlining the principles of Spanish imperialism. However, Rome views the entire military and economic strength of Spain as a tool for Germany and Italy to pursue their ambitions in the Mediterranean." A correspondent for the "Daily" newspaper in Rome wired, "Since the Italian army has gradually occupied Albania, it has become increasingly clear that the Italian government will adopt a policy of annexation. This can be seen from the fact that gentlemen in the capital of Albania submitted a letter to Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, offering the throne of their country to the King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III. This approach is similar to Italy's previous conquest of Abyssinia. Soon the King of Italy will also be the King of Albania, and the city of Tirana will be governed by an Italian-appointed governor." (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Resumption of Duties in the Capital

After spending a two-week vacation in Warm Springs, President Roosevelt returned to Washington today by special express train. According to advisors close to Roosevelt, the President is extremely concerned about the current situation, as the threat of war is very imminent. Upon returning to Washington, he will discuss everything with the Secretary of State. The President told his neighbors before leaving, "If there is no war, I will return again in the fall." (Associated Press dispatch, 9th)

### British Cabinet Decides to Guarantee Greek Territory - Parliament Scheduled to Reconvene on the 13th - Chamberlain to Make a Statement

(London) Parliament is scheduled to reconvene on the 13th, at which time the British government will issue a declaration stating that the territorial integrity of Greece will not be allowed to be violated. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(London) The British Cabinet met this morning at 11 AM for two hours and fifteen minutes. Only two cabinet members were absent. Holding a cabinet meeting during Easter is unprecedented in many years. Prime Minister Chamberlain presided, and Foreign Secretary Halifax reported on events since last Thursday. In addition to listening to the Foreign Secretary's report, attendees also considered the opposition party's request to convene Parliament early. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(London) The cabinet held a meeting this morning, the content of which was not made public. The discussions likely pertained to the situation in the Balkans. During the cabinet meeting, the Romanian ambassador to the UK, Tilea, and the Greek minister to the UK, Simopoulos, both visited the Foreign Office, which suggests this. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(London) The cabinet held an important meeting at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street at 11 AM today. All cabinet members were present. The general situation in Europe, particularly the situation in the Mediterranean after Italy's capture of Albania, was submitted for discussion. Regarding the general situation in Europe, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck will negotiate a "mutual guarantee" with Romania and Hungary in the near future. The Romanian and Turkish foreign ministers also discussed this issue yesterday. Regarding the situation in the Mediterranean, the British cabinet is most concerned about two points: how this Italian action affects the Anglo-Italian Agreement and how it affects the military and strategic situation in the Eastern Mediterranean. Regarding the first point, diplomatic circles here say that this agreement stipulates that the status quo in the Mediterranean should be maintained and that Britain and Italy should exchange military intelligence. Italy's actions clearly violate the terms of the agreement. Britain could simply declare the agreement terminated, but no decision has been made yet. Regarding the second point, Greece and Yugoslavia have both been threatened. Furthermore, news from Athens in recent days is quite alarming. The British cabinet has taken appropriate measures to prevent this and has decided to assist Greece and protect Corfu. In addition, the cabinet also discussed the issue of reconvening Parliament. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(London) According to today's official announcement, for the public interest, Parliament will convene on Thursday (April 13th). Normally, Parliament would have adjourned for Easter on April 6th and would not reconvene until April 18th. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(London) Government sources have indicated that Britain should immediately conclude bilateral agreements with Greece and Turkey to provide security guarantees. The cabinet is expected to make a decision soon. This agreement will be similar to those that Britain has negotiated with Poland and is considering with Romania. If Italy makes new threatening moves in the Mediterranean, Britain will conclude mutual guarantee agreements with relevant countries to deal with them, but it seems inappropriate to announce this immediately given the current situation. In addition, regarding the issue of Italian volunteers withdrawing from Spain, the British government is willing to give Italian Prime Minister Mussolini a final chance to fulfill his promise. In other words, if Italy can withdraw its volunteers, the British government will not terminate the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Unfortunately, reports received here from Spain are quite contradictory. British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon to inquire about Italy's true intentions in order to clarify the situation. Although the British government has not officially issued a statement regarding Italy's invasion of Albania, it cannot be considered passive. The British fleet has taken major measures in the Mediterranean, especially in the waters off Greece and British Cyprus. In recent days, it has also been actively engaging with Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania, hoping to establish cooperative relations among the Balkan countries, including Bulgaria, and to obtain Turkey's permission for British and French warships to pass through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits when necessary. Britain's proactive stance is evident here. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(London) All newspapers carried diplomatic news on the front page, stating that diplomatic authorities were extremely active yesterday. Although the Italian government has provided assurances that its actions are limited to Albania, everyone knows that Mussolini's promises are the same as those provided by Hitler and cannot be trusted lightly. Many newspaper diplomatic correspondents say that the cabinet has decided to accelerate negotiations with the Balkan countries and that Parliament will reconvene on the 12th or 13th of this month, at which time Prime Minister Chamberlain will issue a statement explaining Britain's position. The "Daily Mail" reported, "Prime Minister Chamberlain may convene Parliament on the 12th or 13th of this month to explain Britain's current foreign policy." The "Daily Express" reported, "Britain's top priority is to prepare for war, because only in this way can peace be achieved, and only through self-improvement can peace be guaranteed for the nation and threats be addressed." The "Daily Herald" reported, "At this point, the policies of democratic countries have adapted to the environment and are sufficient to deal with the crisis. However, understanding the crisis is not enough; it must be overcome to be effective." The "Times" reported, "Sources in Rome, who have accurately predicted various events caused by Germany in the past, now predict that Bulgaria will become a diplomatic pawn for the two dictators within a few weeks." (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Shift in American Public Opinion

(New York) According to statistics released by the American Institute of Public Opinion, there has been a significant increase in the number of Americans who are willing to supply Britain and France with food and munitions in wartime. According to the Institute's survey results, before the Munich Agreement in September of last year, 57% of Americans were willing to supply Britain and France with food. Last month, this had increased to 76%, and this month it has increased to 82%. Before the Munich Agreement, only 5% of Americans were willing to supply Britain and France with munitions. Last month, this had increased to 17%, and this month it remains at 17%. Before the Munich Agreement, 5% of Americans were willing to send troops to Europe to help in the war. Last month, this had increased to 17%, and this month it has decreased to 16%. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### German-Italian Conspiracy Still Brewing - Will Incite Bulgaria to Rise Up - Romania Hesitant and Cautious - Plans to Send High-Ranking Officials to Germany for Birthday Celebrations

Istanbul - Bulgaria is said to have designs on Romania's Dobruja region (this region originally belonged to Bulgaria, but most of it was ceded to Romania after the end of the Second Balkan War; the majority of its residents are Bulgarians). If this materializes, the Balkan Entente will face a serious test. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(London) A dispatch from the "Times" correspondent in Rome stated that according to sources in Italy, Bulgaria will soon be used as a pawn by Germany and Italy in the diplomatic chessboard, inciting demands for a free port in the Aegean Sea. If so, Germany and Italy will demand a corridor to the Aegean Sea. If Britain and France do not effectively curb this, they will further demand that Romania cede Dobruja on the Black Sea. A dispatch from the "Times" correspondent in New York stated that American officials seem to believe that the Albanian affair is only the starting point for a series of serious events to come, and that the Danzig crisis will soon occur. An editorial in the "Times" stated that Italy's claim that the oppressed people of Albania requested Italy to send troops is a complete pretext, and that its recent motive is that the time has come for Italy to satisfy its vainglory. The invasion of Albania is for strategic reasons, namely to use Albania as a bridge to the Balkans. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Bucharest - Many quarters here are speculating about the possibility of Germany and Italy taking swift action after the invasion of Albania. Circles friendly to Germany and Italy even say that Germany will propose a "Joint Economic Plan" encompassing the entire Balkan Peninsula on April 20, Hitler's birthday. Furthermore, according to Bulgarian official sources, Bulgaria is willing to cooperate with other Balkan countries to maintain peace and uphold the "Balkan Monroe Doctrine." (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Bucharest - A delegation will arrive in Berlin on April 18 to participate in the celebration of Hitler's birthday. The delegation includes the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Commerce, and high-ranking army officers. The leader of the large delegation will be the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Army. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(London) Individuals connected with the Balkans here have stated that the Romanian government is still hesitant and cautious about signing a mutual assistance agreement with Britain, as it believes that this matter has preconditions: (1) Turkey should allow British and French fleets to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits in wartime to assist Romania. This requires a definite decision from the Turkish government. (2) Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union should also sign a mutual assistance agreement to form a strong front in Eastern Europe to resist aggression. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Romania and Turkey Agree to Win Over Bulgaria

Istanbul - Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu have departed after discussing the situation. Before leaving, they made a statement to the press: "Within the scope of the Balkan Entente, Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and I have discussed recent events and agreed on matters of common interest. We have decided to firmly promote the current policy of the Balkan Entente in order to enhance relations with our neighbors. The authorities of Romania and Turkey have not held negotiations but have only confirmed points of agreement. All developments have been communicated to the other Entente countries, namely Yugoslavia and Greece." (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Ankara - After Foreign Minister Saracoğlu's conversation with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, the semi-official Anatolian News Agency issued a statement: "Within the scope of the Balkan Entente, the diplomatic authorities of both sides have considered shared interests in connection with recent events. They believe that the policy of the Balkan Entente focuses on maintaining peace but also has a firm nature, with the purpose of guaranteeing security, safeguarding independence, and, in accordance with the spirit of the Salonica Pact (i.e., the pact signed by the Balkan Entente countries and Bulgaria, recognizing Bulgaria's equal rights to armament), enhancing relations with neighboring countries. This policy will continue to be implemented with unwavering spirit." (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### The Netherlands Actively Deploys Defenses on the Border

(London) The "Daily Express" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in the Dutch capital, stating that military administration has been implemented in the area within 50 kilometers of the border between the Netherlands and Germany. All bridges have been laid with mines. The Easter leave of officers and soldiers in the army and navy has been cancelled. The authorities have also made preparations for breaching dikes so that one-third of the country can be flooded within a few hours if necessary. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Prime Minister of Athens Announces Reassurance

Athens - Prime Minister General Metaxas recently delivered an address to the Greek people on the city's radio station, stating, "In order to comfort public opinion and dispel anxiety, the government solemnly declares that the independence and territorial integrity of our country will definitely be maintained, and the safety and honor of the people will also be properly guaranteed. It is hoped that the people will live and work in peace." (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Athens - King Zog I of Albania, along with his entourage, arrived in Salonica this afternoon and checked into the Mediterranean Hotel. Prime Minister Kota and other cabinet members left the city shortly after arriving. It is reported that they will travel to foreign countries via Mukyo by boat. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Swedish Authorities Announce Neutrality

Stockholm - Minister of Defence Sköld said here today, "Cooperation with countries outside of Northern Europe involves great risk. Foreign guarantees are also unreliable. Our natural attitude is neutrality. We must be calm at the moment. National defense has many opportunities to repel aggression, and is equal to mutual risk of failure." (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Egyptian Ambassador to the UK Returns Home for Consultation

(London) After Italy took military action in Albania, the Egyptian Ambassador to the UK, Hassan, immediately set out to return home to consult with government authorities on the Mediterranean situation and the defense issues of the country proper, Sudan (a condominium of the UK and Egypt), and Palestine. He is expected to arrive in Cairo today. Egyptians here are unwilling to express what attitude the country will take. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Germany Denies Troop Movements

(Berlin) It is claimed here that reports in foreign newspapers that Germany has moved troops to the borders of the Netherlands, Switzerland, or Denmark are completely unfounded. Current troop movements in Germany are only the return of troops from Moravia and Bohemia to their original defense areas. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Albanian Puppet Provisional Government Formed - Italy's Six Demands Have Been Ascertained - Mussolini Still Feigning

Tirana - An Albanian provisional government was established today under the leadership of the Italian authorities. The cabinet has seven members, with former Prime Minister Ypi as chairman. According to sources close to representatives of the Italian government, Albania will not become an Italian colony, nor will it become an Italian protectorate. Under Italian "supervision," a purely Albanian government will be established. The new Prime Minister Ypi is respected by Albanians and foreigners residing in Albania. The Minister of the Interior is Gada Lillia, the Minister of Finance is Mark, the Minister of Education is Bertov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is Ishko, the Minister of Public Works is Siri, and the Minister of Economy is Alex. Most of the officials in the provisional government are Christians. A statement was issued today instructing Albanians to obey Italian civil and military authorities for the time being. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

(Rome) A bulletin from Tirana stated that mechanized units occupied Korytza in southern Albania today. The administrative committee organized by "Albania's best officials and dignitaries" has temporarily taken over government affairs. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Tirana - According to news from here last night, Italy has established a "Provisional Administrative Committee" in Albania, composed of Albanian military and political figures. This is a temporary transitional body, and a permanent new government will be established soon. However, foreign affairs and military affairs will be handled directly by Italy, and no separate departments will be established. Normalcy has gradually returned here. Shops and cafes have reopened, filled with Italian soldiers, and there is a constant flow of pedestrians. However, it is reported that 20,000 Muslims and mountain people are still resisting in the interior but have switched to guerrilla tactics. The Italian embassy here is piled high with confiscated pistols, rifles, and shotguns. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

Trebinje, Yugoslavia - Before Italy invaded Albania, it put forward conditions that were rejected by King Zog I of Albania. The content of these conditions, totaling six, has been ascertained by a Havas correspondent from a key figure in Albania: (1) The Albanian government should allow Italian troops to land in the country at any time and place. (2) All Albanian projects, such as fortresses, roads, bridges, and ports, should be managed and supervised by the Italian military authorities. (3) All Italian expatriates in Albania should enjoy the same civil rights as Albanians, such as the right to be elected as deputies and to serve as cabinet ministers. (4) The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be abolished immediately, and the interests of the country in various countries should be represented by Italian diplomatic representatives. (5) The Albanian government should appoint Italians as secretary-generals in all departments. (6) The Albanian government should appoint the Italian minister as a cabinet member, and the Italian government should also appoint the Albanian minister as a cabinet member. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(Rome) Italian troops have occupied the town of Korytza on the Albanian border near Greece. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Trebinje, Yugoslavia - A Havas correspondent who observed the progress of the Italian invasion of Albania for three days has arrived here. According to his account, the Italian side claimed that it had to send troops to protect Italian expatriates because Albanians were mistreating them. In fact, most Italian expatriates left Albania before the invasion. In the case of Korytza, Italy sent several planes to pick up expatriates, three times in total. Furthermore, at the time when the Tirana radio station (the capital of Albania) broadcast news of the Albanian army fighting bravely in Durazzo and Valona, the Italian consulate had already closed. Several teams of armed Albanian farmers went to the north to assist the regular army. Having traveled around various places since the start of the war, the correspondent also saw no mistreatment of foreigners. After Italian troops arrived in Elbasan, the correspondent personally saw the remnants of the Albanian army, exhausted, retreating from the front lines in trucks. A small number of volunteers, still using old-fashioned rifles with rust marks, hid in the mountains in an attempt to stop the advance of Italian armored vehicles. In general, some tribes in the mountains will continue to resist for a long time, and it is feared that Italy will not easily be able to quell them. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano returned here from the capital of Albania and immediately met with Prime Minister Mussolini to report on his trip, which lasted a long time. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(Rome) The semi-official Stefani news agency recently reported that Prime Minister Mussolini has donated 190,000 gold francs to the Albanian poor. Foreign Minister Ciano distributed this donation when he visited the country's capital yesterday. In addition, the government loaded a large amount of food and clothing onto a mail ship and transported it to the port of Durazzo to provide relief to refugees. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### African Muslims Oppose Italy

Algiers: Dr. Benjelloul, President of the Muslim Association of the Algerian colony, recently wrote to Governor Le Beau today, stating, "We have a bond with the Albanian nation and deeply sympathize with the changes they have undergone. We firmly believe that they will achieve final victory in a short period. Conversely, we express our indignation and protest against Italy's aggressive actions. We wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm our loyalty to France, believing that France will surely protect the honor and prestige of us Muslims." The association also telegraphed this document to President Lebrun and Foreign Minister Bonnet. (Havas, 9th)

Tunis: The Tunisian Arab Nationalist Party held a demonstration on April 9th last year, demanding the establishment of a parliament, which led to clashes with the military and police, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Today marks the first anniversary. Italian radio stations are broadcasting various programs in Arabic, intending to incite the group to rebel, but they have not been swayed. The entire territory of Tunisia remains peaceful. Moreover, since Italy invaded Albania, the group has been extremely indignant towards Italy due to religious beliefs. (Havas, 9th)

### South Australia Falls for the Fifth Time

Shantou Correspondence: Nan'ao, isolated overseas, is beyond the reach of the Chinese army. Only police teams are left to maintain law and order. When Japanese warships arrive, the people flee to the mountains. When they leave, the original order is restored. The household registration and Baojia system have gradually achieved considerable results. Unexpectedly, on March 28th, Japanese warships suddenly sent troops to land on both sides of Long'ao and Houzhai. Chen, the head of the Long'ao police station, and Zhang, the Bao chief, were tied up and killed because they could not escape. This is the fifth time the county has fallen. Japanese warships are currently stationed in Nan'ao and the north and south ports of Chenghai, and one ship each is stationed in Heduotou, Chaoyang. Every day, speedboats are dispatched to chase and capture fishing boats and sailing boats. Fish and goods are plundered, and many boatmen and fishermen are killed. The Nan'ao County Office is located on a certain island in Xiaoping Huanggang. A few months ago, fishermen were repeatedly dispatched to secretly transport ammunition and food to support the military and civilians stationed in Nan'ao. These fishermen risked crossing the sea. Those who were killed by Japanese soldiers on the way included Ou Hexin, Ou Bingcai, Yu Panchi, Zhu Huicheng, Zhu Chunduo, Ou Muquan, Ou Zhonghe, Wu Wugui, Liu A'niu, Liu Zineneng, Liu Muliang, Zhu Ruxian, Liu Yutang, and Liu Yali, among others. The ××× Division Headquarters, considering the loyalty and bravery of the fishermen, specially sent Adjutant Hou Rongbiao to Xiaoping with funds to comfort the families of each person, each receiving 80 silver dollars, and additionally compensating for bamboo raft expenses, 10 dollars per raft. A stone monument was also erected on the seashore to commemorate the fishermen who died in the disaster, as a model for fishermen at sea. Recently, many coastal fishing boats have been captured by Japanese warships and linked together on the Nan'ao beach, about 100 or more. The fishermen are detained in thatched huts under the mountain. Hua Zhenzhong, commander of the Chao-Shan Garrison, issued a notice prohibiting all boats and ships from going to sea to avoid further poisoning.

### The Current Situation of the New Provincial Capital of Xikang (Continued): Various Groups Promote National Salvation Work

A Bird's-Eye View of Ethnicity

Kangding is a complex mix of ethnicities. There are many people from Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, and there are also missionaries from Britain and France hiding among them. In addition, there are local Han Chinese and natives. Most of the natives are Tibetans, including Tibetans, Kang people, Yi people, and Xifan people. There are also mixed bloodlines such as Kang-Tibetans and Han-Kang people. The Hui and Mongolian people are all from other places. Tibetans living in the city are commonly known as Manjia. Kang people are called Kangbawa. They speak the Kang language, use Tibetan characters, and maintain their inherent characteristics in customs, clothing, and lifestyle. Only a few have assimilated with the Han people. The lives of wealthy families are quite prosperous. The utensils in their homes are mostly the same as those of the Han people, but they only eat Zanba, butter, and butter tea, and rarely eat rice. The poor earn their own living. Women in the city mostly carry tea bags and transport goods, collect firewood and carry water, and sell them to make a living. Men in the countryside engage in agriculture, industry, commerce, and various other industries. Women also do various kinds of labor. The houses are extremely dirty. They sit on the ground and sleep in clothes. The uncleanliness of the habit makes people want to vomit when sitting with them. The total population of the county is only more than 30,000. According to the recent survey by the Provincial Capital Police Bureau Preparatory Office, there are 73 local households in the urban area, with 675 men and 419 women. Among them, mining is the most common, followed by handicrafts, and commerce is the least common. Guozhuang accounts for 31 families (Guozhuang is the name of the hotel and warehouse business operated by Kang people). There are 2,375 registered households, with 6,568 men and 5,687 women. Commerce is the most common, followed by industry, mining, and transportation. There are 5 foreign households, with 8 men and 9 women, including 3 British, 4 Americans, and 9 French, and 1 Nepalese, mostly Catholic and Evangelical missionaries, followed by doctors from Anxi Monastery and other hospitals. According to statistics, there are a total of 2,453 households in the city, including local, out-of-town, and foreign residents, with a total population of 13,366 men and women.

Cultural Level

Kangding is located on the border and is very different from the interior. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, it began to change from Tusi rule to centralized administration and established schools. However, due to the failure to popularize education, everything is lagging behind. In terms of culture, there is no scholarship other than the Five Vidyas. Other than Buddhism, there is no thought. All family and social life and folk customs are all dominated by Buddhism. Where there are temples, culture follows. The Kang people have believed in Buddhism for a long time. Everyone's body and mind are completely tied to it. Their lives are happy to be detached from the world. The Five Vidyas are the foundation of culture. Ordinary people are not skilled in production skills, and intellectuals are not interested in politics. All external thoughts, academics, and modern culture have no way to be instilled. Therefore, the consciousness of the masses is still under the control of theocracy. The cultural level can be imagined. There is only one provincial normal school in Kangding's secondary schools. In addition, the Central Political Branch School has an attached simple normal department and a middle school department. The Department of Education recently proposed to establish a provincial middle school in Luding, which is currently under preparation and is expected to open next month. There are one provincial and one county elementary school. In addition, there is one Kanghua Elementary School established by the Catholic Church. Cultural aggression is with sinister intentions. Only a small number of children who rely on the church for a living go to school there. As for people's education halls, libraries, and reading rooms, they are simple and dilapidated due to financial constraints. Local publications include the Xikang News, which publishes one Zhang a day and is sold throughout the county. The Western Frontier News Agency is attached to the Xikang News Agency. No manuscripts have been seen. In addition, there is the Kangdao Monthly, which is sponsored by the Kangding County Training and Learning Association, but only three issues have been published, and the fourth issue has not been seen for a long time.

National Salvation Movement

Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the border areas, in view of the crazy aggression of the Japanese warlords, have also launched the anti-Japanese movement. Various cultural groups, under the impetus of the national salvation upsurge, have worked harder to publicize national liberation. For example, the dissemination of texts and drama movements, although not spread to every corner of the border, have also achieved considerable results. The earliest national salvation group established in Kangding was the All Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association, but it was disbanded soon because the internal organization was not sound. The Mobilization Committee was subsequently formed to promote national salvation work. On the women's side, there is the Kangding Women's Wartime Education Promotion Committee, which has set up women's education and training classes, with Madam Yang Yunguang, wife of Chairman Liu, as the class leader. It has been quite effective. In terms of religion, there is the Xikang Provincial Branch of the Chinese Islamic National Salvation Association, with more than 100 members, all of whom are Islamic compatriots. The Xikang Provincial Party Department, in view of the fact that the national salvation work urgently needs a sound group to lead and promote it, recently convened a meeting of people from all walks of life, intending to restore the Anti-Japanese Support Association. The principle has been approved and will soon be reorganized and restored.

Lama Life

Kang-Tibet has established itself as a Buddhist country for more than a thousand years. Its people, regardless of men, women, old or young, all regard Buddhism as the highest and most supreme religion. The Kang custom is that if there are three sons, two of them must be lamas, and one of them will inherit the family business. If there are two sons and daughters, one will marry a Han Chinese as a son-in-law to manage the family affairs, and the son will enter the temple as a monk. The meaning is: My master is the Buddha. My son is a lama, and the Buddha will surely bless me, remove my illness, and relieve my suffering. And since the son is the most superior person, no one dares to deceive me, and life can be solved. There are seven lama temples in the corner of Luding City, namely Anjue Temple, Namo Temple, Duoji Temple, Sakya Temple, Yigong Temple, Ebapa Temple, and Duozha Temple. According to statistics, there are more than 200 lamas in the city, mostly from the Yellow Sect, followed by the Red Sect. Each temple is controlled by the Grand Lama, the so-called Khenpo or Buddha Governor. The Kang people regard the position and power of the Grand Lama as no less than those of Han officials. Whenever they see the Grand Lama traveling, men and women take off their hats, let down their hair, and stand respectfully on the side of the road. If they get the Grand Lama to touch their heads, they will regard it as a lifelong miracle. As for the importance attached to the lama temple, it goes without saying. The lamas in each temple live by chanting scriptures. Whenever a civilian family dies or has an illness, they must ask the lamas to chant scriptures to eliminate sins, paying one or two or three yuan a day. Wealthy families will ask the Khenpo or Buddha Governor to chant scriptures, and they will reward them with mules, horses, and other things. The way they chant scriptures is different from that of Han monks, such as sending ghosts. Sending ghosts is mostly done in the morning. At that time, many lamas sit around in the field, blowing pythons, horns, and trumpets, humming and drumming, and knocking on mirrors to match the rhythm. In the middle, there is a lama with a towering copper hat, holding a Hada in his hand, making a gesture of command. As soon as he waves his hand, the drums and horns will be played and changed immediately. First, they come out of the sutra hall in single file, and then walk around the temple once, and then return to sit down. Then, they go out to the suburbs in formation, and arrive at the destination, just like the witches and shamans in the interior jumping on the altar, and then cremate their silk clothes and the made figures of black birds and beasts, which are the ghosts that are sent away. Some also knead noodles into various fierce ghosts, choose a day to send them to the wild dam, and wealthy families mostly hold guns and live ammunition, aiming at the dough ghost and shooting until it is hit. The rest mostly stab with knives. If the lamas do not go to the homes of civilians to chant scriptures, they will recite the classics in the temple. The sentences and readings all have rhythm, and the drums and cymbals are used to show the rhythm. Occasionally passing outside the temple, the sound is murmuring. The lamas eat four or five meals a day, and when they are hungry, they eat Zanba. The drinks are tea and butter, all of which are supplied by the temple. The reporter visited Ebapa Temple on the 23rd. The temple belongs to the Red Sect and is located at the foot of Zierpo Mountain. There are troops stationed in the temple. A small lama led him up the stairs to visit his master, the Grand Lama. The Grand Lama is a Kang person, with a dark complexion, about fifty years old, wearing a foreign leather cassock, with his right shoulder exposed outside his clothes, sitting cross-legged on the bed. When he saw the reporter coming, he gestured with his hand to ask him to sit down. He did not know the Han language, and I did not understand the Tibetan language. I asked his disciple to translate the meaning of the visit. He got up slowly and poured a cup of butter for me. I thanked him and drank a little of it. The taste was strong and fishy. Then someone came to pay a New Year's greeting. The reporter stood up and visited the statues of the gods. He saw that there were many gods enshrined, and their dharma aspects were solemn, mostly made of gold. In addition to bowing to the gods one by one, those who paid New Year's greetings kowtowed to the Grand Lama at the end. He sat and accepted it. After the reporter finished visiting, he bid farewell and was sent to the gate by his disciple. (End)

### National Zhejiang University's Yishan Campus Bombed: 118 Incendiary and Fragmentation Bombs Dropped, Students Slightly Injured, Equipment Suffered Heavy Losses

(Special Dispatch from Yishan) Guangxi Yishan was heavily bombed by 18 Japanese planes on February 5th. Hundreds of bombs were dropped inside and outside the city, destroying the county party headquarters, library, Lequn Society, and hundreds of houses in the southwest, south street, southwest suburbs, and bus station, killing more than 20 people and injuring more than 70. The Biao Ying dormitory of National Zhejiang University, in a small area, was hit by 118 incendiary and fragmentation bombs (the number has been clearly counted). There is little doubt that it was a deliberate destruction of cultural institutions.

Biao Ying was an old barracks, located about three miles east of the city. After Zhejiang University moved to Yishan, it was opened as a dormitory for sophomores, juniors, and seniors, with a total of 339 students living there. It is connected to the large parade ground in the north, which covers dozens of acres. To the east of the dormitory, a new auditorium was built. To the west of the parade ground, 22 new classrooms were built. Most of the classes were taught here. Although the 5th was a week, there were still several classes making up lessons. As soon as the alarm sounded, teachers and students ran to other places to take shelter. The east dormitory caught fire. The physical education teacher led the students to put out the fire. A student was lying close to a bomb, and the mud and dirt buried him so that he could not be seen. Those who were hiding with him cried around him. The student was slightly injured, heard the sound, jumped up, and comforted everyone with his hands. Other students had their clothes torn by the bullets, their heels cut by stones, their faces covered with sand and soil, and their backs hit by huge stones and fell to the ground. Iron sheets brushed their shoulders and passed over their heads. Only Xu Jiasen was injured in the back of the neck by shrapnel, and Gao Changrui's finger injury was more serious, but they also recovered the next day. It is estimated that there are more than 1,500 teachers, students, staff, and family members of the whole school living inside and outside Yishan City, and they are all safe and sound, which is really a blessing. The houses and objects destroyed by the whole school include: one building with eight rooms in the east dormitory of Biao Ying, one auditorium, three new classrooms with fourteen rooms, one physical education office, one tutor's office, one training office, one affairs office, one reading room, and three school worker rooms. Dozens of surrounding kitchens, dormitories, storage rooms, dining rooms, gatehouses, and miscellaneous houses were also destroyed and could not be inhabited. A piano was also destroyed and jumped dozens of feet away. In addition, 30 acres of physical education fields, with large holes densely arranged like planting vegetables, are unusable. The ball rack platform and other sports equipment were completely destroyed. The total loss of school property is valued at 30,000 yuan.

The east dormitory was occupied by sophomores, with a total of 122 people. Except for the clothes they were wearing, their books, clothes, boxes, and suitcases were all gone. Savings were also burned. The total loss of students is also valued at 20,000 yuan. That night, classrooms were opened as bedrooms. Teachers, students, and family members who had more luggage took out the rest to help those in need. They could barely sleep. The school allocated 2,000 yuan, and the faculty and staff donated 3,000 yuan to purchase clothing and bedding. Classes were suspended for two days to reorganize the classrooms. On the 8th, classes resumed as usual. The losses of the faculty and staff included: the residence of Li Qiaonian, dean of the School of Engineering, was completely destroyed, and the residence of Hu Gangfu, dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, and Secretary Zhuge Zhenggong were partially destroyed.

### End of This Session's Public Exhibition Cup Handball Tournament: Central Youth Team Defeats Western Youth Team; Conclusion of Five-on-Four, Yesterday's Doubles Two-to-One; Championship in Suspense, Western Youth Still Wants to Continue the Tournament

The ninth "Public Exhibition Cup Central-Western Youth Handball Tournament" saw a climax last night. Three doubles matches were held. Due to a temporary change in the order, Hua Fenggang of the Central Youth team arrived late, and the lineup was adjusted. The Western Youth team also made changes. At 6 o'clock sharp, the first doubles match saw Zhu Kuan and Yan Peiqiu of the Central Youth team against M. Kringle and You Shi of the Western Youth team. Zhu Kuan, a famous player, displayed extraordinary skill, with fierce smashes, truly unmatched. Supported by Yan Peiqiu's short blocks, they easily defeated Kringle and You Shi with scores of 21-8 and 21-11. In the second doubles match, Sun Jialu and He Shuoqing of the Central Youth team faced F. Kringle and Huamu of the Western Youth team. In terms of strength, Sun and He were stronger, but their positioning was flawed. Although they led for most of the game, they ultimately lost the first set 19-21. In the second set, Kringle and Hua took an early lead of 10-4. After reaching a tie at 13-13, Sun and He fought back hard, coming from behind to win 20-13. However, they lost the final serve, and Kringle and Hua won again 21-20, tying the overall score at 4-4. The third doubles match featured Sun Daosheng and Hua Fenggang of the Central Youth team against Gerber and Stanley of the Western Youth team. This was the decisive moment for both sides, and they both put forth their full effort. Sun and Hua had the upper hand. Although they initially trailed by six points, they eventually won the first set 21-9. In the second set, Sun and Hua performed even better. After an 8-8 tie, Sun repeatedly executed clever shots, achieving remarkable results. Hua used his fierce "柯欣" serve to decisively defeat the opponent, ultimately winning again 21-13. As a result, the Central Youth team defeated the Western Youth team 5-4 over the three days, and should have rightfully won the championship for consecutive years. However, after the match, Boratto, a member of the Western Youth team's sports department, suddenly claimed that this was only the first week, and that the Central Youth team would only win the championship if they won the second week, which would be held in the second half of the year. Ling Xitao, the person in charge of the Central Youth team, was not present yesterday, so the championship is still in suspense.

### Yarn and Cotton: Spring Holiday; Stable Foundation for Spot Yarn and Cotton

Yesterday, the yarn market was still closed for the Spring Festival holiday. However, according to investigations, market prices were up by two or three yuan compared to the closing prices on Thursday. The starting price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 387 yuan, and it is currently selling for 388.5 to 389 yuan. The current spot price for 20-count Tiannv yarn is 390 yuan, and the price for 20-count Golden Rooster yarn is 395 yuan (cash price). The price for 10-count Yu Ji yarn is 303 yuan. According to some traders, the future trend of cotton yarn prices is stable. Today, 100 bales of yarn were exported to Tianjin, 190 bales to Shantou, and 270 bales to Hong Kong.

The cotton market is closed for the holiday, so there are no market reports. However, the general situation remains calm, with no major differences from the closing prices before the holiday. Tongzhou cotton with better quality is still priced at 78 yuan, while cotton with slightly inferior quality is priced at around 77 yuan. Tongzhou cotton is still arriving in Shanghai daily.

### Piece Goods: Summer Suit Fabrics Released Early

Summer-season fabrics such as Pallas, serge, Wanliding, feather tweed, Panbiechu, Balene, white drill, white zhigong, yarn twill, yellow twill, Weiyilai, and Kangkeling were released early yesterday. Merchants have already started trading. The transactions for Pallas were quite high. There were many requests for samples of Wanliding feather tweed for suits, and deals could be closed after price negotiations. Yesterday, English-made Kangkeling was sold wholesale at 7.5 yuan, and Three Deer Head brand adhesive-backed yarn twill was sold at 1.25 yuan. Meifeng Fanliding was sold at 7.75 yuan, plaid feather tweed at 8 yuan, and Fengyu white drill at 9.5 yuan. Non-Chinese, non-Western Shuang Huangbian Sima Xiangru white drill was sold at 4.35 yuan.

Thirteen pieces of piece goods arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, and 45 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin and 180 pieces to Shantou today.

### Finance: Cash Market Opens This Morning

Yesterday's cash market black market situation was quiet due to the Spring Festival holiday, and no members gathered. However, many still wanted to sell at the closing price of 2,068 yuan before the holiday (April 6), fearing a potential decline when the market opened today. Buyers, however, were very hesitant to buy due to concerns about the deteriorating European situation. Therefore, no transactions were heard. The exchange rate for silver and jewelry gold remained at half. Datong Bank quoted 210 yuan, Xin Tong Bank quoted 208 yuan (buying price 202 yuan), and the central bank's quotations for customs gold and Shanghai standard gold remained flat. The buying price for Chinese pure gold was 1,212.3 yuan, also unchanged, reportedly because there were no telegrams regarding English pure gold during the Easter holiday.

### Food: Rice Market Opened Yesterday; Both Arrivals and Sales Were Brisk

50,000 to 60,000 bags of Wuxian rice arrived in total

The supply of community rice from various regions was brisk due to the two-day holiday. He Xia had a total of 24 vendors, Che Lun Baozi, and Su Tong provided over 2,000 bags, Changzhou provided 200 to 300 bags, and Kunshan provided 600 to 700 bags. On the sales side, there was more restocking after the market closure. Early morning trading was active on the main street, and speculators also bought cheap. As a result, the market became tight. By noon, the market suddenly relaxed again. As a result, the higher prices of polished japonica rice improved slightly by 5 to 10 cents. Only He Xia rice rose by 20 cents due to its lower price range. Duyang Jian and Bu Jian did not change. Yinbianyuan arrivals were limited, so they also increased by 10 to 20 cents.

Yesterday morning, the main street was briefly active for customer Xian rice, and prices immediately rose by 10 cents. Nanjing Xian opened at 13.3 to 13.4 yuan, and Gao Wu Chongjing Xian also rose to 13.3 yuan. The market seemed to be thriving. However, it was later heard that 50,000 to 60,000 bags of Wu Xian had arrived during the market closure, of which 20,000 bags were transshipped by Mitsui & Co. to Guangzhou and Xiamen. In addition to those unloaded at the Hongkou docks, there are reports of continued arrivals. Therefore, the market price flattened. Saigon rice was sold to eastern Zhejiang after the previous small batch was transshipped, and sellers were looking to raise prices. Yesterday, the price of Saigon original package was raised by 10 cents to 17.2 yuan.

### Chat About Shark Fin

— Tasteless

While urging people not to eat shark fin, let's talk about the true face of shark fin.

Most shark fin is imported and very expensive, which everyone knows, so there's no need to elaborate. When the sea ban was first lifted, the supply was very limited. Therefore, officials and wealthy merchants used it to entertain each other, serving it during banquets to show their status. Now, it has become a staple of celebratory feasts, and people feel embarrassed if shark fin is not served. The extravagance of this custom is lamentable.

Fins are the fins of sharks. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into dorsal fins, pectoral fins, and caudal fins. In terms of quality, dorsal fins are the best, followed by pectoral fins and caudal fins. In terms of value, large pieces are more expensive and small pieces are cheaper. All the fins sold in the market are dried. If you want to cook them, the process is very complicated. The first step is to remove the sand. Boil the raw fins in boiling water (cold water can also be used, but it takes longer). Then, take them out and scrape off the outer layer of sand. This is the first step.

The next step is to cook them. Cook the desanded fins again until they are soft and glutinous. The cooking time depends on the size of the fins. It takes an expert to do it right. Otherwise, the fins will be too hard and unappetizing. Once cooked, rinse them in clean water to remove the hard bones and rotten meat. However, they are still bland and tasteless, much like cellophane noodles. However, fins are chewy and have skin, making them rich. Cellophane noodles are the opposite. Yet, some people never tire of eating fins and treat them like treasures. This is simply pursuing vanity without substance, and wasting money. Is it worth it?

The last step is to season them. It is best to steam the cooked fins with cooked bile stone juice and then add all kinds of ingredients, such as ham, crab roe, shrimp, mushrooms, and vegetables, depending on the situation, and cook them carefully to make a delicious dish. In fact, shark fin itself has no taste. Before the sea ban was lifted, it was considered special because it was rare.

Here is a list of domestic and foreign names, with added illustrations to inform readers. Western fins are produced in Luzon, Timor, and Makassar.

There are also piled fins, also known as cooked fins. There used to be a lot of these, but the taxes increased and the declared price was not met. Therefore, local traders hired workers to modify them and then sell them. The current market price for Longxusi is 550 yuan, single pile is 400 yuan, and fin cakes are 350 to 450 yuan. The cooking method is described above.

In addition, there are also small shark fins, which are the fins of ordinary small sharks. The meat has already been used for cooking. Restaurants and kitchens collect them. After drying them in the sun, they can be prepared and cooked properly to make them tender and delicious, no less than the large fins. Those who are addicted to shark fin should try them.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Unstable; Peanut Oil Continues to Rise by Half a Yuan

Yesterday, the soybean oil market continued the tradition of the 9th. The issue was whether there was a way to make things easier, which led to another decline. Dajin oil opened half a yuan lower than last Saturday. However, there were reports that there would be a rally in Dalian, and some who were well-informed predicted that it would still be unfavorable for oil companies, so it tightened again in the afternoon. As a result, the closing price was the highest point of last Saturday, at 39.7 yuan. The total market saw 200 barrels of Dalian oil traded at prices ranging from 39.1 to 39.7 yuan, 200 pieces of Yanqi oil at 19.2 yuan, 500 dan of Suifeng factory oil at 38 yuan, 500 dan of Dayou factory oil at prices ranging from 30.08 to 31.4 yuan, and 100 cans of canned oil at 32.7 yuan. Peanut oil prices rose another half a yuan compared to last Saturday, and it is likely to continue to rise. Yesterday, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 32.5 yuan, 20 pieces of April oil at 32 yuan, 500 cans of Yantai canned oil at 41.8 yuan, and 20 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil at 44.5 yuan.

Yesterday, 400 pieces of soybean oil were imported from Qingdao.

### Sugar Market: Huizhou White Sugar Opened Yesterday

Yesterday, 200 bags of Huizhou white sugar were opened, priced at 23.6 to 23.3 yuan, with a settlement price of 22.5 yuan. Several dozen bags of Binghua white sugar were priced at 22.5 yuan. Over 100 bags of Shantou red sugar were priced at 14.9 yuan, with a settlement price of 6 cents. Over 200 bags of Huanggang green sugar were priced at 14.8 to 6 cents. The prices set by the association did not change much. Grade 24 crude white sugar from foreign sources was priced at 25.2 yuan, transit goods at 17.05 yuan, Dutch red sugar from local warehouses at 16.75 yuan, Thai car white sugar B mark at 25.3 yuan, and Thai XA mark crude white sugar at 25.075 yuan. There were not many transactions. There were arrivals of 3,950 bags of Thai car white sugar, 391 bags of green sugar, 428 bags of red sugar, 101 bags of white sugar, 100 bags of sliced green sugar, and 1,120 bags of sugar gum from Jinan and Sichuan. In addition, 1,120 pieces of sugar residue arrived from Hong Kong.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Qingdao Raw Peanuts: Price Limits Removed; Market Prices Immediately Rise

Qingdao News: The local exchange's restrictions on the market price of raw peanut futures have been lifted. Therefore, spot market prices have also been opened, rising suddenly by 1.1 to 1.3 yuan. It is reported that there are 50,000 bags in stock, with 1,000 bags arriving daily. Sales to foreign merchants are still good, and the market is very strong. Southwestern mouth peanuts are priced at 13.8 yuan, and Shidao peanuts are priced at 14.2 yuan, purchased by East and West Ocean merchants and oil mills. Also, large-grain peanuts are priced at 14.3 yuan, with a total transaction of slightly under 5,000 bags. Peanuts also rose by 8 cents, with Wangtai raw peanuts at 11 yuan, with 400 bags transacted. Both arrivals and stocks are scarce here, and the market is also tight. The opening price was 16.8 yuan (market ancestor), and yesterday it was called 19 yuan.

Yesterday, 180 bags of melon seeds arrived from Tianjin.

### Seafood: Wenzhou Shrimp Tails: Rare Supply

Wenzhou shrimp tails have become very scarce recently due to unrest in the area. Longya shrimp tails are even more scarce. Only a batch arrived a few days ago and was immediately sold, priced at 100 yuan. At the same time, several pieces of Kaiyang shrimp were sold for 64 yuan, showing strong momentum.

### Coal: Shanxi White Coal Also Transacted

The rising trend of white coal is becoming increasingly violent. This is because the recent supply has been insufficient, stocks are weak, people are excited, and speculators are pushing up prices. Other settled goods are also trending stronger. Yesterday, Shanxi white coal, which has been rarely heard of in the market for a long time, was also traded. Industry insiders broke the price, with bulk coal at 43 yuan per ton and screened lumps at 45 yuan, ex-warehouse in the concession, with additional transportation costs.

### Metals: Prices of White Lead Wire Rise

The local market for new lead wire in Shanghai has been almost completely bought up by merchants from Tianjin and Yantai, causing prices to soar indefinitely. 客帮 (Ke Bang), which were more flexible, switched to white lead wire, causing the market price of white lead wire to also rise due to insufficient supply. Yesterday, it was sold for 14 yuan per dan, up half a yuan from the previous day. Even though it was a tomb-sweeping holiday, the number of transactions still reached 700 to 800 dan. The market is currently short of spot goods, and people are very excited. The market is also sharp, so opening prices are expected to rise further. It is heard that overseas prices have recently been around 45 or 46 yuan, so opening prices in the future are unlikely to ease.

### Import and Export: Over 10,000 Bags of Flour Shipped to Tianjin

Yesterday, 1,000 pieces of fresh eggs arrived from Tianjin. Today, exports of flour include 15,500 bags to Tianjin, 2,000 bags to Yantai, and 2,000 bags to Shantou.

### Songkou Detained Ships Still Not Released. Portuguese Consul Lodges Formal Protest. Japanese Warships Station Troops on Each Ship to Monitor. Over Two Hundred Passengers on the "Libao" Released the Night Before.

After Japanese warships detained nine Portuguese merchant ships in the waters of Eastern Zhejiang, they forced them to sail and anchor outside Wusongkou, with Japanese warships moored alongside. Japanese soldiers boarded the ships to monitor. After the "Libao" was permitted to enter the port, the passengers were released. The Portuguese Consul is scheduled to formally protest to Japan today. The detailed situation is as follows:

Troops Stationed on Each Detained Ship for Monitoring

After the Portuguese merchant ships "Tangbei," "Tanglu," "Tangqiao," "Meida," "Hailong," "Libao," and three clipper ships were detained by Japanese warships in the waters of Zhejiang, they were forcibly ordered to return and anchor at Wusongkou. They were compelled to hoist Japanese flags on the ship masts. Except for the "Libao," which was allowed to enter the port the afternoon before and anchor at buoy No. 18 in Yangshupu, the other ships remain anchored outside Wusongkou. Four Japanese warships are moored nearby. Each detained ship has Japanese soldiers stationed on board, nominally for protection, but in reality, for surveillance. They are also preventing wireless operators from sending telegrams.

"Libao" Passengers Completely Released

The "Libao" steamer of the Zhengde Company, which ran the Ningbo route, sailed from Ningbo on the 5th. It was detained by Japanese warships in the waters of Luotoumen. After being forced to Shanghai, it has now sailed into Wusongkou and is anchored at buoy No. 18 in Yangshupu. As for the 260 passengers on board, they were taken ashore at the new customs wharf by small steam boats dispatched by Japanese warships around 7 PM the night before, one tugboat and one barge each. Although the passengers have now been completely released, the "Libao" steamer remains anchored at the buoy, with Japanese soldiers stationed on board for surveillance. The crew members remain on their respective ships.

Chairman of the Dinghai Chamber of Commerce Arrives in Shanghai Aboard the Ship

Hong Qiliang, Chairman of the Dinghai Chamber of Commerce, and committee member Wen Henian, originally planned to return to Dinghai from Ningbo on the "Libao" steamer. Because the ship was detained in Shanghai, the reporter from the "Xin Sheng She" newspaper specifically visited Mr. Hong and Mr. Wen yesterday. According to them, the "Libao" is a Portuguese ship running the Dinghai-Ningbo route. After being detained by Japanese warships in the waters of Zhejiang, the food supplies on board were limited, and there was soon a risk of running out of food. The shipowner reported this to the Japanese warships, and the Japanese warships sent small steam boats to deliver food (including rice and canned goods) to provide supplies. It was not until around 7 PM yesterday (i.e., the 9th) that they received notice from the Japanese warships that the passengers would be released and transported to the new customs wharf by barges dispatched by the Japanese warships.

"Libao" Passengers Sent Back to Their Hometowns

Most of the "Libao" passengers are from Dinghai. They have used up all their travel expenses and cannot afford to stay in Shanghai. Therefore, they have requested the Dinghai Shanghai Association to provide accommodation and arrange a special ship to transport them back to their hometowns. It is heard that the association has chartered the "Hana" steamer of the German Far East Shipping Company to transport the distressed fellow villagers back to their hometowns to avoid displacement. However, they must first register with the association. Meanwhile, the association has telegraphed the Dinghai County Government and the Water Police Team to send police to protect them. The original telegram is transcribed below: To Su, the County Magistrate of Dinghai County, and Wang Jun, the Captain of the Water Police Team: The "Libao" steamer was forced to Shanghai, and the association is accommodating the passengers. We plan to charter a ship to transport them back to avoid displacement. Please send police to protect them upon arrival at the port. The Dinghai Shanghai Association bows in respect.

Refuting Japanese Justifications with Reason

Because the "Libao" was detained, the manager of the Zhengde Company, Paileila (transliteration), specifically visited a friend of the Japanese at the Japanese Navy Special Affairs Department yesterday to inquire privately. The reasons given by the Japanese side for detaining the Portuguese merchant ships were: (1) The ships were carrying Chinese guerrillas; (2) The ships were carrying military supplies to support the guerrillas; (3) The nationality of the ships was unclear. The manager refuted these reasons with reason, stating clearly that the ships were owned by Portuguese merchants and had never transported military supplies or Chinese guerrillas. He invited the Japanese military to board the ships for inspection. The manager has also reported this to the Portuguese Consul in Shanghai, who will formally protest to the Japanese side.

Detained Passengers Subjected to Thorough Inspection

A passenger from Dinghai on the "Lishi" steamer had a pair of leggings from the militia team found by Japanese soldiers. This caused the Japanese soldiers to identify him as a Chinese guerrilla and detain him. Initially, explanations from other passengers to the Japanese soldiers were ineffective. It is heard that the Japanese military has verified that the passenger is indeed a formal merchant from Dinghai and that the leggings he was carrying did not belong to him. Therefore, he has been released. However, according to another source, the passenger has been detained at the Japanese Naval Headquarters. Furthermore, the passengers on the "Libao" steamer have been subjected to inspections by Japanese soldiers multiple times.

Ruder and Baode Confirmed as Detained

Of the nine detained Portuguese ships, the six that have been confirmed are "Tangbei," "Tangqiao," "Tanglu," "Meida," "Hailong," and "Libao." The names of two of the remaining three clipper ships have been verified by the "Xin Sheng She" reporter as "Ruder" and "Baode" of the Portuguese Wanguo Shipping Company. These two ships loaded cargo in Shanghai on the 7th of this month and sailed to Wenzhou. It was expected that they would have arrived long ago. It was only yesterday that the company confirmed that they had indeed been detained and are currently anchored outside Wusongkou. The name of one more ship cannot be found for the time being.

Portuguese Consul to Lodge Formal Protest Today

After learning that the Portuguese merchant ships had been detained, the Portuguese Consul in Shanghai, Alves, immediately negotiated with the Japanese Consul in Shanghai and the Japanese naval authorities. For days, due to the Spring Festival holiday, no results were obtained. Yesterday, the Portuguese Consul negotiated with the Japanese naval authorities again, but still no results were obtained. It is expected that today, after the Spring Festival holiday ends, he will formally lodge a strong protest with the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, demanding the swift release of the detained ships to maintain the shipping industry of Portuguese merchants in China.

Japanese Warships Have Agreed to Provide Food Supplies

The food supplies on the "Meida" and other ships that have been detained are about to run out. It is heard that the Japanese naval authorities have agreed to provide supplies, so the crew members and passengers need not worry about running out of food. Furthermore, there was a rumor yesterday morning that Japanese warships had allowed the "Meida" to enter the port, which has been confirmed as unreliable. Currently, the "Meida" and other eight ships remain anchored outside Wusongkou. Japanese soldiers are stationed on each ship for surveillance, and Japanese flags are still hoisted on the masts of each ship. It is heard that there are twelve passengers on the "Meida" ship, about fifty passengers on the "Tangbei" ship, and over one hundred passengers on each of the "Tangqiao," "Tanglu," and "Hailong" ships. The three clipper ships are not carrying any passengers.

### Evaluation Committee Announces Total Rice Stock in Shanghai. Over 600,000 Bags in All Warehouses. Scheduled Meeting to Compare Market Measures.

During the Spring Festival holiday, the arrival of rice in Shanghai was quite scarce. Fortunately, the existing stock was sufficient, and the selling price remained stable. The first round of investigations by the Rice Evaluation Committee, which is responsible for investigating the amount of rice stored in rice warehouses throughout the city, was completed last week, totaling 601,344 bags. The Bean and Rice Industry Association held a scheduled market measure comparison meeting. The details are as follows:

600,000 Bags of Rice Stored in Shanghai

The Rice Evaluation Committee, organized by the seven rice industry groups in the city, in addition to evaluating rice prices, also sent personnel to various rice warehouses to conduct on-site investigations of the amount of rice stored. Since the start of the investigation, half a month has passed. The "Xin Sheng She" reporter learned from the committee yesterday that the first round of investigations has been completed. The total amount of stored grain in the city reached 601,344 bags, with the Bank of China warehouse having the most, totaling 110,765 bags, followed by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouse, totaling 99,600 bags. The committee has already prepared a report and distributed it to various rice industry groups and the authorities of the two concessions for reference. The second round of investigations has just begun and will be completed soon.

Scheduled Meeting to Compare Market Measures

The Bean and Rice Industry Association issued a notice for a scheduled meeting to compare the market measures used by the industry, stating, "The market measures used by the industry have been compared quarterly. Since the autumn of the year before last, due to the situation, it has been suspended. It is now planned to resume the meeting, and prior to that, registration for the 'need to compare old measures' and the customization of new measures will be carried out. All members who need to compare ten old measures or customize a certain number of new measures must submit the attached form to the association (or submit it to the North and South offices for transfer) before the 15th of this month, so that the number can be counted and the address selected, and then a scheduled comparison can be held. Please comply with the requirements."

### North of Suzhou Creek. Scams Occur Frequently. German Refugees and White Russian Immigrants. Often Scammed When Repairing Houses.

The Continental News reports that a large number of German refugees and White Russian immigrants in Shanghai have recently been seeking houses to live in the Huishan and Yangshupu districts, resulting in many people claiming to be "foremen" contacting them about repair matters and demanding surprisingly low prices. However, after repeatedly trying to defraud them of funds, they disappear without a trace. Hundreds of German refugees and White Russians have been deceived by them. Some have been defrauded of as much as one hundred yuan by "foremen." Currently, this type of scam is emerging endlessly on the north bank of Suzhou Creek.

### Silver and Money Industry. Resumes Business After Holiday Today.

Securities, spot yarn, Huahua, and other markets open simultaneously. The Silver and Money Industry Association, various member firms and banks, as well as the silver and money industry reserve, the bank draft exchange, the draft acceptance office, and the foreign exchange, cash, securities, yarn, Huahua, and other markets, have been closed for four days since the 7th due to the Tomb-Sweeping Festival. The holiday has now ended, and all will resume business as usual today.

### Passengers on the "Libao" Steamer Talk About. Four Days of Maritime Adventures. Detained from the 5th and Released Only on the Evening of the 9th. Two Cannon Shots at Midnight Shocked Passengers Greatly.

After being detained and brought to Shanghai, the passengers of the "Libao" steamer, which was inspected and detained by Japanese warships in the waters of Luotoumen, were released the night before. Yesterday, a passenger from the ship described the whole story in great detail, as it was all experienced and witnessed by himself.

According to him, the "Libao" steamer sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai at 12:30 PM on the 5th. At that time, because it was widely rumored in Ningbo that Zhenhaikou would be closed at 3 PM that afternoon, the number of passengers on board was more than usual, totaling over two hundred people. Around 5 PM that afternoon, the ship arrived in the waters of Luotoumen, close to Zhushanmen at the entrance of Dinghai. Unexpectedly, at this time, it suddenly encountered three Japanese warships. One of them immediately ordered it to stop using signal flags. Soon, Japanese warship No. 86 lowered a steam boat carrying seven or eight Japanese soldiers, who boarded the ship to conduct a thorough inspection. The passengers were all herded onto the third deck, and the search was quite thorough. Later, a set of uniforms resembling militia uniforms was found in the luggage in the main cabin, and the steward was immediately interrogated to identify the owner of the luggage, resulting in the arrest of one passenger. He was detained in the waters of Luotoumen. At 2 AM on the 6th, they suddenly heard two cannon shots from the Japanese warships. All the passengers woke up from their sleep, extremely frightened. They dared not go back to sleep all night. After dawn, they learned that the cannon shots at night were to prevent other ships sailing to Wenzhou. At that time, the number of detained ships was found to have greatly increased, but the names of the ships could not be seen. At 5 PM on the 7th, the Japanese warships forcibly took several detained ships to anchor in the waters of Tongsha. At that time, because the food on board had run out, the Portuguese shipowner, Kake, used signal flags to communicate with the Japanese warships, and was given six dan of rice, as well as salt and other canned food. The above-mentioned food supplies were all signed by the shipowner, clearly as a basis for future claims. Also, on this day, Japanese flags had been hoisted on the masts of each ship. At 1 PM on the 5th, they were forced to anchor in the waters of Sanjia at Wusongkou. Shortly after 6 PM, they were ordered to sail to Wusongkou and anchor at buoy No. 18 in Yangshupu. After about an hour, a motor tugboat, a small steam boat, and a steam boat were sent, totaling three ships, to transfer all the passengers and crew members to the Bund New Customs Wharf to disembark. They had been trapped on the ship for four days and nights before regaining their freedom. The people on the same ship were all residents of Dinghai and other places, so their desire to return home was very urgent.

### Japanese Aircraft Scatter Absurd Leaflets in Western Shanghai

Around 10 AM yesterday, three Japanese aircraft flew low over the towns of Hongqiao, Caohejing, and Meilong in western Shanghai for reconnaissance. Around 2 PM, another Japanese aircraft scattered false leaflets over Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai before flying towards Zhabei.

### Flour Mills Stock Up on Foreign Wheat. No Worries About Raw Materials in the Future. Domestic Wheat Expected to Appear in Early May. Market in North China Improves, Sales Increase Monthly.

The batch of over 300,000 bags of foreign wheat that flour mills in the city ordered from overseas has arrived. Raw materials are sufficient and can be maintained for long-term use. Domestic wheat will also appear in about two months. Currently, the market for flour sales in North China and South China is gradually improving. The details are as follows:

Foreign Wheat Arrives, Raw Materials Sufficient

Due to the large-scale purchase and export of domestic wheat from the production areas along the Yangtze River by the Japanese, flour mills have felt a severe shortage of raw materials for flour production. Therefore, they have ordered foreign wheat from overseas, including Australia and Canada, in stages, totaling over 300,000 bags, which is mixed with domestic wheat for flour production. The foreign wheat has been shipped to Shanghai in batches by foreign ships. The mills that placed the orders have distributed the wheat according to the list and stored it in warehouses. Therefore, there are currently sufficient raw materials, which can be maintained for long-term use without feeling the shortage again.

Domestic Wheat Will Appear Soon

The wheat planted in the agricultural areas of various counties along the Yangtze River this spring has grown vigorously. Due to the sudden cold and hot weather and slightly more rain, the growth is not very robust. If the weather is sunny and rainy in mid-April to early May, the wheat production this year should not be a poor harvest. It is expected that the wheat along the Yangtze River can be harvested and new wheat can be produced in about two months. As for the wheat planting area, due to the decrease in the population of rural areas in various places since the war, not all of the land can be planted. Therefore, the output will be less than last year.

Turnaround in Flour Sales Market in Various Places

After the Japanese flour monopolized and dumped flour in the North China flour market, the sales of domestic flour were limited to a corner. The sales scope was only within the counties in the inland areas of Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, and the Japanese flour was also mixed and sold in various ports along the Yangtze River. Since February of this year, merchants in Tianjin, Yantai, Xiamen, and other places have ordered and transported flour from Shanghai for sale because the quality of Japanese flour is too poor and the market price is higher than domestic flour. The amount has been increasing day by day. The situation of each mill has improved compared to the same period last year. However, the Japanese impose heavy taxes on flour transported from Shanghai, so it is still difficult to compete.

### Grain Exchange. Aftermath of Labor Dispute. Urging Employees to Move Out. Recovering Exchange Premises for Own Use.

After the Shanghai Grain Exchange labor dispute was mediated by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, it was stipulated that the exchange would pay living expenses to the employees, but the employees should move out of the exchange before March 18. Now, because the employees have delayed moving out, the exchange is requesting them to move out quickly, because the exchange urgently needs to recover the premises for its own use. It is untrue that the exchange will rent out the premises, as rumors suggest.

### Shanghai's Population. Reaches Five Million. Refugees Return Again and Again. Restaurants and Lodgings Flourish.

The Continental News reports that, according to the investigations made by the authorities of the two concessions, the total population of Shanghai is now increasing sharply and will reach the level of five million. At present there is still a trend to increase, and it is anticipated that it will not be long before that number is exceeded. The reason for this is that the refugees continue to come to Shanghai and those who previously returned to their hometowns, because they are unable to make a living in the interior, therefore return to Shanghai. At the same time, the commercial life of Shanghai continues to flourish, unparalleled, and this applies to the trades of restaurants, lodgings, food and other similar businesses. But perhaps it can be said that this kind of prosperity generated from war, is almost limited to within the city, because the main commercial relations with the interior, have fallen towards a standstill.

### Heavy Fighting Yesterday on Border Between Shanghai and Nanhui Counties. Puppet Troops Clash. Xu Hongfa and Zhang Miaogen Compete for Territory. Both Sides Use Heavy Military Equipment in Extremely Fierce Massacre.

Around 8 AM yesterday, Xu Hongfa's unit of the "Self-Defense Corps" of Chuansha in Pudong and Zhang Miaogen's unit of the "Self-Defense Corps" of Nanhui suddenly

Engaged in heavy fighting

in the Nanyang Jingqiao and areas north of Weihang on the Shanghai-Nanhui border.

Each side had three to four hundred men, and they were all using all their strength to massacre each other. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented. It had not stopped until 5 PM in the evening. The Japanese military, on the other hand, believed that the fighting was a conflict between puppet troops and did not involve them, so they

Remained inactive

According to the investigation, the cause of the fighting was a dispute over territory. Because both sides were unscrupulous and willingly surrendered and submitted, the Japanese used them to deploy defenses in the Shanghai-Nanhui area to prevent guerrillas from advancing north and avoid threats to the Japanese military. The puppet "armies" then began to scheme against each other, competing to recruit bandits and

Expand their power

and arbitrarily set up puppet "tax checkpoints" everywhere, regardless of the people's suffering, competing to collect puppet "taxes." Often, an item had to pay double puppet "taxes" to both sides after passing through a distance of several miles. Setting up one more puppet "tax checkpoint" meant one more income. This led to a major feud over interests. The weapons used by both sides yesterday included

Light and heavy machine guns

The people in the area suffered from the war and fled. The "puppet armies" suffered heavy casualties due to the fierce fighting. According to the reporter's report when passing through Pudong, the two sides had not yet determined the winner and loser, and the massacre was still continuing. The Japanese military along the Pudong area was on high alert to prevent accidents.

### Grand Opening of Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting from Past Dynasties

Several famous collectors in Shanghai jointly initiated and held the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting from Past Dynasties in China to raise funds for medical and relief purposes. After many days of preparation, it opened at 5 PM yesterday on the fourth floor of the Great New World Department Store and began its exhibition. This exhibition is truly unprecedented in Shanghai, bringing together masterpieces from famous artists of past dynasties. Therefore, the number of visitors was very crowded. There was heavy traffic in front of the Great New World Department Store.

The event was a great success. Guests included Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yiping, Ding Fuxiu, Xue Dubi, and consuls from various countries, Westerners, etc., totaling thousands of people. After the opening, Ambassador Yan Huiqing delivered a speech, saying that the exhibition was a rare opportunity, and that the collectors were able to generously open the exhibition, breaking the old habit of private viewing in the past.

Their enthusiasm for relief is commendable and admirable. Furthermore, the exhibits are a collection of the glory and spirit of our nation. With this glorious history, the future of national liberation can be assured, he said. Lin Kanghou followed Ambassador Yan and delivered a speech. Finally, Liu Haisu delivered a speech. The guests then began to view and appreciate the works. Due to the large number of works and the small space, not all of them could be displayed publicly. The works range from the Five Dynasties, with representative works from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties.

The exquisite works include Guan Tong's "Double Rivers and Layered Peaks" from the Five Dynasties, Dong Qichang and Wu Ercheng's collaborative calligraphy and painting from the Ming Dynasty, Gong Xian's "Willow Banks and New Cattails," Shi Daoshi's "Playing the Zither to an Ox," Bada Shanren's "Reed Goose Painting," Huang Daozhou's calligraphy, Wang Shigou's landscape painting, as well as Yu Boshu's "Thousand Character Classic" from the Tang Dynasty, Zhang Chongyu's "Children at Play Painting," Su Shi's cursive script scroll, and Tang Yin's

"Thousands of Cliffs and Myriad Ravines," among hundreds of other works, a dazzling array that is a feast for the eyes. It is heard that the exhibition will run from the 11th (today) to the 25th, for a total of fifteen days. Tickets are one yuan each. It is expected that people from all walks of life will be able to donate to medicine and relief and view famous paintings, and that the number of visitors will be very enthusiastic during the exhibition period.

### Rumor that a "Shanghai Vegetable Market" Will Be Set Up on Yueping Road. Lowering the Prices of Various Items. Undoubtedly Manipulated by the Japanese.

Lowering the Prices of Various Items. It is rumored that between North Sichuan Road and Yao'an Road in Hongkou, a so-called "Shanghai Vegetable Market" will be established on the 25th of this month. Chinese vendors will account for 60%, about 250 stalls, and the main goods will be green vegetables and other foods. According to the English Great America Evening News, the prices of various items sold in the "market" will be extremely low, and the organizers will undoubtedly be manipulated by the Japanese.

### Striving to Maintain the Credit of the Currency System. Chinese Legal Tender Becomes More Stable. Ministry Orders Promotion of Small Denomination Notes to Redeem Damaged Notes. Legal Tender Still the Main Currency in Guerrilla Areas.

The issuance policy of Chinese legal tender is particularly cautious and has always been stable. The cash reserve has always been above 60%. In order to maintain the credit of the currency system, the banks in various provinces have been ordered to promote small denomination notes, redeem damaged and worn notes, and send personnel to supervise the issuance of notes by various banks. Legal tender continues to circulate normally in the occupied areas. The details are as follows:

Chinese Legal Tender Becomes More Stable

Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese legal tender has always been stable. This is truly due to the proper handling of the situation before and after the event by the Chinese financial authorities, and to the consolidation of the Chinese economic foundation itself. The main source of funding for China's wartime finance is increased taxes and public debt, rather than resorting to issuance policy, which is the main reason for the stability of legal tender. International payments are also able to be coordinated properly, so that the evolution of the exchange market tends towards stability. Over the past five or six months, various loans from friendly countries have been completed one after another, and the people's minds have been greatly stabilized, and they have become more optimistic about the future of the war. Therefore, the stability of legal tender still stands in an unbreakable position.

Striving to Maintain the Credit of the Currency System

In order to maintain the credit of the currency system, the Ministry of Finance has decided at the local financial conference that: (1) Provincial banks or local banks in various provinces should assist the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank in promoting small denomination notes, and should accept the task of redeeming damaged and worn notes; (2) They should strive to handle the task of redeeming gold and silver entrusted by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, and should transfer the collected amounts to the four banks to be used as cash reserves for leading coupons; (3) The issuance of notes by provincial banks or local banks in various provinces should be handled under the constant supervision of personnel dispatched by the Ministry; (4) Those who lead the use of one-yuan notes and auxiliary currency notes should earnestly handle the various businesses stipulated in the original outline.

The Existence of Legal Tender Means the Plot Has Failed

Although the Japanese control the occupied areas and actively seek to utilize economic resources, Chinese legal tender has remained as stable as ever in the year since then. Legal tender is still the main currency in the occupied areas. The people in the Pingjin area hoard legal tender and refuse to use counterfeit money as before. Therefore, with the existence of legal tender, the counterfeit money policy has no technique to apply. The so-called yen bloc cannot be applied to the Chinese guerrilla areas due to the stability of legal tender and the belief of the people. At the same time, the existence of legal tender has greatly helped to maintain the hearts of the people in the occupied areas. The people care for the government upon seeing legal tender, and the national consciousness is increasing.

### Japanese and Puppet Forces Harassment: Instability in Shanghai West; Yexie Recovers and Suppresses Mixed Bandit Troops; Japanese Troops in Pudong in Extreme Panic

A person from Yexie reported that recently, due to the central army's Han Yingjie's troops and the independent 45th brigade's recovery and suppression of mixed bandit troops, battles often occur in the countryside. Cowardly residents are fleeing to Shanghai. However, after strict reorganization of the town, order has been restored, the trend of robbery has been greatly curbed, and people's hearts are calm.

Death of Self-Defense Corps Drill Instructor Zhang

Zhang Jun, a Shandong native serving as a drill instructor under Yang Mao, the head of the Qibao Town Public Self-Defense Corps in Shanghai West, was shopping in Qibao Town at around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. Suddenly, three Japanese soldiers disguised as villagers noticed that Zhang had a box cannon on his person. They followed him and, upon reaching Tang Bridge, suddenly drew handguns and shot at Zhang. Several shots were fired, all hitting vital points. He died instantly, and his body was thrown into the Puhui Pond before the perpetrators fled.

Guerrilla Squad Holds Secret Meeting

The guerrilla squads in the Shanghai suburbs have been exceptionally active recently, and many regular army troops have also arrived. Japanese soldiers, fearing being ambushed by the guerrillas, dare not go out. Unexpectedly, in recent days, Japanese soldiers have been disguising themselves as Chinese farmers or workers, forming groups of three to five, and secretly probing the guerrillas' whereabouts. Our loyal and brave soldiers, due to temporary negligence, have suffered unknown casualties. Regular army troops, together with the chiefs of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army and the Public Self-Defense Corps, have held a secret meeting in a certain place to discuss countermeasures and subsequent battle plans, carefully and thoroughly, until late at night.

Japanese Military Equipment Transported Across the River

The Pudong guerrillas are about to launch a major offensive, causing the Japanese to panic. For days, large numbers of Japanese naval and army soldiers have been transferred from Hongkou, Zhabei, and other places to reinforce various strategic points in Pudong. Yesterday (the 9th), at around 8:00 AM, the Tanaka unit and the Kikuchi unit, currently stationed in Shanghai West, each selected more than 500 soldiers, who rode in military trucks to the South Wharf. They were transported in batches to wharves such as Qiujiang to disembark. At the same time, 600 to 700 soldiers from the Hongkou area crossed the river on ferries such as the Dongchang Maru and Qichang Maru, along with several small steel cannons and more than thirty boxes of ammunition, all bound for Pudong. The ferries at South Wharf were temporarily suspended.

### Japanese Merchant Iwase Seizo Shot and Killed in Datian; Three Chinese Fled the Scene; Japanese Troops in Jiading Swept Away by Guerrillas

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reports that, according to Japanese newspapers, Iwase Seizo, a 41-year-old Japanese man and the owner of Sanduo Trading Company, which deals in construction materials on the sixth floor of the East Asia Bank at 299 Sichuan Road, along with a Chinese iron broker named Zhang, were traveling in a truck driven by a driver at 9:30 AM yesterday (the 9th). They were planning to go to Luodian to purchase official iron plates. When they reached a bridge about two kilometers from Datian, three Chinese suddenly jumped out from under the bridge, shouting and ordering the truck to stop. They dragged Iwase down, and one of them fired a shot, the bullet entering from the right side of his back and exiting near his right chest. Another person used a heavy iron object to strike the right side of the Japanese man's head. Zhang and the driver, in a panic, fled. The three Chinese remained at the scene after the attack, apparently waiting for other Japanese to arrive to harm them. Soon, two Japanese employees from a certain Japanese shop, along with several Japanese soldiers belonging to the telegraph unit, approached the area. The Chinese saw them and fled. The Japanese pursued them, firing more than a dozen shots, but the three Chinese escaped without a trace. The Japanese then reported to the Datian garrison, which immediately dispatched troops to search for the fleeing Chinese. The victim was rushed to Fumin Hospital, where he died of his injuries shortly after noon. Police from the criminal investigation section of the Japanese Consulate immediately investigated the case. None of the deceased's belongings were lost, except for a watch, which was apparently taken, as the watch strap was still hanging on the deceased's wrist. Because there were no other signs of robbery, the Japanese believe that this was the work of anti-Japanese terrorists. According to Japanese police, in addition to the head injuries and chest gunshot wound, scratches on the deceased's face indicate that there was a fierce struggle.

More Than Half of Japanese Troops in Jiading Annihilated

The fighting in Jiading has been fierce for days. More than 200 Japanese soldiers were surrounded by Deng's First Security Regiment, and more than half were annihilated. The remaining troops are still fighting desperately, attempting to break the siege. At the same time, they urgently requested reinforcements from Japanese troops in Suzhou for a counterattack. Upon hearing the report, the guerrillas lurking in the suburbs of the city rushed to the front lines overnight to join the fight and sweep away the Japanese troops, fearing that Deng's troops would be defeated.

New Asia Hotel Sets Up a Large Gambling Table

Recently, Japanese troops in Hongkou have set up a large gambling table in the New Asia Hotel (formerly the Asia Hotel), calling it the "Japan-China Club," which is actually a disguised gambling den. Whenever the lights are lit at night, Japanese ronin and a group of lower-level Chinese traitors gather there to gamble wildly, hoping to win big. The internal staff are all female, and there are several separate smoking rooms. The place is bustling with activity, day and night. It is said that the person in charge is Li Fubiao, a famous Taiwanese ronin sent by the Japanese Army Special Service Agency, who boasts of being an expert on Shanghai.

### New Danish Ship, the Grena, Arrives in Shanghai; Carries 12,800 Tons; The Fastest of the Danish Cargo Ships

The "Continental News" reports that a new motor vessel built by the Danish East Asiatic Company, named the Grena, recently sailed from Denmark via the Straits Settlements, China, and Japan. Yesterday (the 9th), it arrived in Shanghai, completing its maiden voyage to the Far East, and docked at the Huishan Wharf to unload cargo. The ship is the longest of the Danish commercial vessels, measuring 506 feet in length. During its trial voyage, its speed reached 18 knots, making it the fastest of the Danish cargo ships. When fully loaded, it can travel at about 16 knots and carries 12,800 tons. It has six double passenger cabins, each with a bathroom, accommodating twelve passengers. The facilities are quite luxurious and include a modern dining room and smoking room. The East Asiatic Company has ordered three new ships to sail to the Far East. Once all are built, they will operate regular cargo services between Europe and the Far East.

### Citizen Groups Promote Sponsorship Campaign; Distribute Sponsorship Certificates and Thank You Notes; Tongcheng Company Promotes Disaster Relief

The Citizen Group of the Shanghai Shoe Workers' Relief Association Committe for fundraising for sponsorship program has begun distributing sponsorship certificates to donors and will hold its third team leader meeting on the 16th of this month to continue promoting the sponsorship of refugees. Details are as follows:

Numbered Thank You Notes Begin Distribution

The association, to implement sustainable refugee relief, promotes the refugee sponsorship movement. All sectors are enthusiastically participating. According to the association's sponsorship regulations, the sponsored refugees should be numbered separately, along with photographs, to notify the sponsors. The association has therefore created a type of sponsorship certificate, a beautiful hard card. In addition to the refugee's photograph and number, the refugee's name, age, gender, origin, and address are also clearly indicated. Sponsors can use this certificate to visit the refugees they sponsor and keep it as a souvenir. The association has now begun distributing the sponsorship certificates and thank-you notes at the same time. However, the numbering and photographing of refugees in each shelter are very complicated, and there are many sponsorship donors at the same time. Therefore, it has been decided to handle it in batches by district.

Letters Sent to Each Team to Intensify Fundraising

The Citizen Group Fundraising Committee sent letters to each fundraising team leader yesterday, stating: "We, the organizing fundraising team, are assisting the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association in raising disaster relief funds. We have submitted and reviewed the results of three rounds of fundraising, which have been quite enthusiastic. We have scheduled the third team leader meeting for 2:00 PM on Sunday, April 16th, at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road, and will also submit the results of the fourth round of fundraising. We earnestly request you to continue your efforts to reach the predetermined goal and benefit the disaster-stricken people."

Overseas Merchants Sympathetically Participate in Disaster Relief

The Tongcheng Industrial Company in this city sent a letter to the Citizen Group, stating: "Our company is organized by British and German merchants and engages in import and export and advertising business. Although we have different nationalities, we have always held ardent sympathy for China's heroic resistance against Japan, and we feel compassionate for the displaced people in various places. We would like to contribute a little from our business to express our sincere concern. The advertising department has launched the publication of a 'Shanghai Concession Lane Joint Poster Advertisement,' with each issue lasting fifteen days, using full-page posters and bright, beautiful color rubber machine printing. It depicts the suffering of our compatriots, and the surrounding areas are filled with advertisements for department stores and medicine, using beautiful and moving illustrations to spread awareness in the isolated island of the suffering of our compatriots at all times. For customers who publish advertisements, they can promote themselves and appeal for aid for the disaster-stricken people, which is truly a win-win situation. Our company is willing to follow the percentage donation method based on business income, extracting 10% of the total monthly income for long-term donations. When the advertisements are posted, we plan to request your association to send capable refugees to assist in the work, and our company will pay them reasonable wages to provide assistance." The association has sent a reply expressing its gratitude.

Local Goods Industry Suggests Painstaking Efforts to Donate to Disaster Relief

Since the Relief Association and the Industry Group Fundraising Committee have been actively promoting commission-based disaster relief in various industries in this city, it has become increasingly widespread. The Local Goods Industry Association replied to the Industry Group yesterday, stating that it had resolved to implement the donation of 1% of the commission business standard to disaster relief and requested that personnel be sent to collect it on the 5th of each month. After receiving the letter, the Industry Group has forwarded it to the Relief Association, requesting that a notice be issued and that personnel be sent to collect it as scheduled in the future.

### Soybean and Rice Industry Association Notice: Rice Boats Must Dock at Designated Areas; Local Hoodlums Intercept Rice Boats to Manipulate and Extort; Baggers Carriers Lose Jobs

The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association yesterday sent letters to the Rice Carriers Association, Changshu Guild, South Helper Guild, Beishi Rice Market Management Office, Rice Shop Industry Association, and Rice Dealers Association, stating: "According to the letter from the Shanghai Rice Cart Transportation Industry Workers' Union, the over a thousand rice carts belonging to our union have always been engaged in bagging work in various rice shops and factories in Beishi and have never experienced encroachment from outside the industry. After the August 13th Incident, the original rice boat docks became inconvenient to use. We were often invited by various rice industry sectors to request the Municipal Council to designate the area east of the New Garbage Bridge, west of the Old Garbage Bridge, and along North Henan Road as rice boat docking areas. The police station has occasionally sent detectives to protect the area. Unexpectedly, in the past two months, local hoodlums such as Zhang Liguo, Xu Da Si Zi, and Xu Xiao Gou Zi have gathered petty criminals at the Tianhou Temple Bridge Changtai Traffic Grindstone and other non-designated docks to intercept rice boats, exploit cart workers, and arbitrarily extort money. They forcibly demand four or two cents per bag of rice. The rice boats are manipulated by these people to go east or west, and the cart workers are repeatedly coerced. Nine hundred cart workers and five thousand family members are suddenly plunged into unemployment. Forced by circumstances, we request assistance to ensure that all rice boats dock in the New Garbage Bridge area to facilitate cart transportation. According to a subsequent letter, the gang's accomplices are numerous, working in shifts, plundering at will, and leaving no room for cart carriers to stand. In addition, the rice bags in each warehouse are also transported by trucks hired by local hoodlums, causing the entire workforce to be unemployed.

"If this continues, conflicts are bound to occur, and rice boats will also suffer losses. We are writing again to earnestly request that shipowners be ordered to relocate to the New Garbage Bridge area for unloading before the 10th of this month to avoid conflicts and prevent losses. We are forwarding the information to you and request that you promptly notify rice boat merchants to ensure that rice boats arriving in Shanghai in the future dock in the area designated by the Municipal Council to avoid disputes.

Heavy troops have been stationed along the river and coast, with defensive works built and strict precautions taken. Now, the Ningbo Defense Commander, in order to strengthen the defense of Zhenhai, thoroughly destroyed the Longshan Pier the day before yesterday, prohibiting all ships from docking.

### Light and Small Printed Matter Sent by Mail Can Be Exempted from Loss Fee; But if Intentionally Taken Advantage Of, the Original Items Must be Returned

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1537: It has been found that postal items such as books and printed matter that need to be transported by car are subject to a car transportation fee. This has been notified by this Bureau's Notice No. 1522 on December 8, 27th year. Now, for the convenience of individual mailers, all small books, printed matter, and trade contracts weighing no more than 100 grams will be considered "light items" and will be exempt from the car transportation loss fee. However, if anyone takes advantage of this provision and intentionally divides heavy books, printed matter, or trade contracts into several packages and mails them as "light items" in order to avoid paying the car transportation loss fee, this Bureau will return the original items to the mailer. If the mailer's address is unknown and cannot be returned, this Bureau will handle the items as "underpaid mail" in accordance with Article 14 of the Postal Regulations. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge. This notice, Bureau Chief Zha Peilin, April 8, 28th year of the Republic of China.

### Trademark Infringement Case Set for Sentencing on the 15th

Lin Meibin, a Ningbo native, 33 years old, shareholder and manager of the Tianxing Candy and Biscuit Factory at 1385 Yuyuan Road in Shanghai West, recently hired lawyer Wu Peng to represent him in a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Yao Futing (40 years old), a Shanghai native and owner of the Liangyou Candy Company at 42 Yinjiagang Road, Xujiahui, for trademark infringement and harming agricultural, commercial, and industrial crimes, requesting legal prosecution. It is alleged that the plaintiff's Tianxing Candy and Biscuit Factory's Copper Drum brand fruit candy has been approved for trademark registration and has been filed with the Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Industry Association. In October of the 27th year, it was discovered that the Shuanggu brand fruit candy produced by Liangyou Candy Company was being sold in the market. Its shape, packaging, trademark pattern, and color were all identical to the plaintiff's Copper Drum brand, which affected the plaintiff's business. A report was made to the Industry Association to prevent it, but it was ineffective. It was a deliberate imitation. In addition to requesting prosecution in accordance with Article 253 of the Criminal Law, it is requested that the civil lawsuit be reserved, etc. The court accepted the complaint and summoned both parties for a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff, accompanied by his lawyer, appeared in court to state the facts. The defendant, accompanied by his defense lawyer Wang Chengxiang, appeared in court and stated that Liangyou Company was established in October of last year and that its trademark was Shuanggu brand. The plaintiff's product is the Single Drum brand. As for Liangyou Company's trademark, it was handled by Xue Wenxuan, and I am unaware of the content. After Judge Li verified the statement, and considering that the facts of the case were clear, he opened the debate and announced the adjournment, setting the sentencing for the 15th.

### Fei Muwen Secretly Carves Seals to Forge Loan Receipts for Fraud; One Scheme Fails, Another Evil Plan Arises; Fails to Appear After Summons and is Scheduled for Another Hearing

Hou Shiying, a native of this city residing in a bungalow in the Huayuanfang on Jin Shenfu Road, recently hired lawyer Jin Weimin to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court against Fei Muwen (also known as Fei Donghai and Fei Yusheng), residing at 258 Tongfu Road, for forgery and other offenses. The indictment states that Hou and the defendant have a close familial relationship and frequent contact. My father, although possessing some assets, is illiterate and cannot read. The defendant has always been very capable, and all household affairs are entrusted to him. The defendant's requests have always been granted. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, the defendant claimed that his Huada Commercial Company needed funds and took advantage of my father's false imprisonment in the police station, ostensibly to help him run around and rescue him. He insisted that my father use all of the property title, No. 2819, along with the title deed, as collateral for his overdraft with the Zhejiang Industrial Bank.

For five years, out of consideration for family ties, I never urged for repayment. The war broke out the year before last, and my father was in dire straits. The defendant still made insatiable demands. Because his desires were difficult to fill, he harbored resentment and set traps to threaten and defraud me of money, which resulted in criminal charges being filed in the Second Special Court. One scheme failed, and his resentment grew. He instigated hooligans such as Luo Xiangsheng to falsely accuse the plaintiff of fabricated evidence to the Huishi police station. I filed a criminal lawsuit with your court. My father realized that

The relationship has been severed, and it is difficult to tolerate it any further. Therefore, he filed a civil lawsuit with your court requesting the return of the title deed. He dared to secretly carve seals and forge a loan receipt for 13,000 yuan from the plaintiff and submit it as a defense. If he is unfortunately misled, not only will the valuable title deed be impossible to recover, but the continuous chaos will cause the plaintiff and his son to lose their family property. Your court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court have determined that the loan receipt submitted in the name of the plaintiff was forged by the defendant, as

The verdict has been reached. It is clear that the defendant has violated Article 210 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, I am filing a private prosecution in accordance with the law, requesting that he be punished according to the law. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiexun ascended to the second criminal court to summon the defendant. The defendant failed to appear after the summons, and it was ordered that the hearing be rescheduled and the defendant be summoned again.

### Two Coal Shop Runners Collude in Fraud; Chen Kangyuan Denies Everything; Wanted Criminal Lu Yili on the Run

Lu Yili, a 36-year-old Changzhou native and runner at the Huacheng Coal Shop at 33 Sichuan Road, falsely claimed to Wu Tiejian, a Cantonese native, owner, and manager of the Huacheng Coal Shop, on March 4th of this year, that the Greater China Rubber Shoe Factory needed 500 tons of Hongji coal dust. Because the shop was out of stock, he claimed that the Yuanxiang Coal Shop at 106 Gamsdong Road in the French Concession had the goods and could be purchased to replenish the stock. Shop owner Wu Tiejian believed this to be true and sent clerks Weng Shaoyou and Zheng Changgen with 6,680 yuan in cash the next day to accompany Lu to the Yuanxiang Coal Shop on Gamsdong Road to negotiate the purchase of coal. When Weng, Zheng, and Lu arrived at the Yuanxiang Coal Shop, they contacted Chen Kangyuan (34-year-old Ningbo native), a runner at the shop. Weng and Zheng handed 6,680 yuan to Lu Yili and waited in the shop downstairs. Lu took the money and went upstairs with Chen for a moment. Lu came downstairs and handed Weng and Zheng a bill of lading for 200 tons of Hongji coal dust from the Tongchang Coal Shop's Pudong Sanjing warehouse. On the 7th of the same month, Huacheng's lighter sent someone to the Pudong Sanjing coal warehouse to pick up the goods, but they could not find them. They looked for Lu Yili, who had handled the matter, but he had absconded with the money. It was then discovered that the Tongchang bill of lading was forged. It was realized that Lu Yili and Chen Kangyuan, a runner at Yuanxiang Shop, had colluded in fraud to obtain the money. A report was made to the French Police Station, and detectives detained Chen Kangyuan for prosecution at the Second Special Court, along with a civil lawsuit, seeking to recover the defrauded money. Chen pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to defraud, and the hearing was postponed. The plaintiff has entrusted lawyer Wang Hengyuan to publish a reward for the arrest of the wanted criminal Lu Yili. The case was reopened by Judge Qiu of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. The defendant, Chen Kangyuan, still denied any conspiracy to defraud and claimed to know nothing about Lu Yili's purchase of goods. After the court verified the statement, it was deemed that the facts of the case still needed to be investigated, and the hearing was postponed to the 13th.

### Four Years Married, Still No Conjugal Relations: Young Woman Requests Divorce; Husband and Mother-in-Law Abusive, Refusing Entry and Disregarding Livelihood

Shen Jiaju (28 years old), from Shanghai, residing at 45 Taoyuan Village, Lafayette Road, was recently sued by his wife, Shen Xiangmeixiang (25 years old, residing at 23 Ningbo Road), who retained lawyers Wu and Xue to file a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court requesting mediation for divorce. The court granted the petition, and Judge Jiang opened Civil Court Four yesterday for mediation. Both parties were represented by their lawyers, and did not appear in person. First, the petitioner's lawyer stated that the petitioner married Shen Jiaju on April 27th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). Upon discovering that the opposing party was suffering from tuberculosis, she followed her mother-in-law's advice for the sake of his early recovery, and temporarily refrained from marital relations, existing in name only as husband and wife without the substance. After a month, she returned to Ningbo for a short stay. Upon returning to her husband's home, her husband suddenly changed his attitude drastically, living separately in another room and treating the petitioner as an enemy. From the summer of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), not only did the opposing party himself frequently mistreat her, but the mother-in-law also aided and abetted his abuse. Unable to bear it, she temporarily took refuge in her mother's home, and was not allocated any living expenses. "During the August 13th Shanghai Battle, her parental home's property in Hongkou was destroyed. After being persuaded by relatives and friends, she returned to the opposing party's home, but was unexpectedly refused entry. Furthermore, the petitioner's own clothing and accessories were not allowed to be taken out. On December 23rd of last year, a letter was sent to the opposing party through an intermediary, but it was ignored. Therefore, she requests the court to mediate and approve the divorce." Subsequently, the opposing party's representative, lawyer Tang Hao, stated that Shen Jiaju never abused the petitioner and does not have tuberculosis. He stated that his client does not agree to the divorce. After hearing the arguments, the court ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful.

### Embezzlement of Funds: Imprisonment for One Year and Six Months, Suspended for Three Years

Meng Zaiyuan, 43 years old from Shandong, residing at 13 Xiaoshadu Road, had been a salesman at the Sincere Cosmetics and Materials Factory at 15 Maqi Road for five years. He was highly trusted by the factory's director, Xu Zhaohe. However, after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Meng suddenly changed his behavior and took the opportunity to collect and embezzle a total of 1,400 National Currency from seven customers, disappearing without a trace. Manager Xu entrusted others to search for him without success, and had no choice but to report the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station. Finally, at 9:20 AM on the 28th of last month, a Chinese detective arrested Meng in a small teahouse on Shunde Road, taking him to the police station and transferring him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the continued hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Quan-yin filed a public prosecution for embezzlement, and stated that the lawyer engaged by the plaintiff had withdrawn the attached civil suit because Meng's guarantor had already compensated for the embezzled funds. Furthermore, during the police search of Meng's home, some of his wife Zhao's belongings were confiscated. He requested that these items be returned. However, he requested that Meng be prosecuted according to the law for the crime of embezzlement. When questioned, Meng confessed that he was confused and that the money had been borrowed by a friend. He requested leniency. Judge Huang sentenced Meng Zaiyuan to one year and six months of imprisonment, suspended for three years, for continuing to embezzle items held in the course of his business. All confiscated belongings were to be returned to Meng and Zhao upon their claim.

### Woman's Brave Action: Capturing a Bandit

Ba Jinxiu, a 17-year-old woman from Changzhou, residing in a bungalow in Jiangjia Lane, Haifang Road, left home at 8:45 PM the day before yesterday to buy white sugar from a nearby dry goods store. As she took out a five-yuan national currency note and thirty cents from her bag, Yang Fu-en and Zhang Yang-gen, two hooligans from Jiangbei, spotted her. They conspired to rob her of her belongings and flee. However, Miss Yan was quite brave and immediately grabbed Yang Fu-en. In desperation, Yang gave the banknotes and coins to his accomplice Zhang Yang-gen, who fled. Miss Yan's neighbor and fellow townsman, Zhang Hengsheng, helped her chase and capture him. Police Constable No. 3014, patrolling the streets, arrived after hearing the alarm and took both bandits, Yang and Zhang, to the Gordon Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday, they were brought to the Criminal Division Three of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tian-yin presented the case and requested a postponement. Subsequently, Miss Yan testified about the robbery of her property by the two defendants. When questioned, Yang and Zhang's statements were evasive. Judge Liu Yugui ordered that they be remanded in custody for a later hearing.

### Difficulties of Island Life: University Student Reduced to Beggar; Over a Thousand Beggars Arrested in the French Concession; Educational Group to Provide Moral and Educational Guidance

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a large number of refugees have sought refuge in Shanghai from various regions. However, due to unfamiliarity with the place and the difficulty of finding employment, coupled with the tightening of the local market and the difficulty of living, some refugees have been reduced to beggars, scattered throughout the two special districts. Recently, the French Municipal Council, in order to improve the appearance of the city, has dispatched police to arrest beggars squatting and crawling on the streets for several days, housing them in the International Relief Committee's Second Shelter. According to Xu Xunhua, the General Secretary of the Education Group of the International Relief Committee, who spoke to a reporter from the Hùshēng News Agency, the educational level of these thousand or so beggars varies greatly. Half are illiterate, a quarter have a primary school education, and another quarter have a middle or high school education. Particularly regrettable is that one of the female beggars is a graduate of a university in Nanjing, with a high level of education, but unable to find a foothold in society. The association is currently investigating in detail the reasons why they became beggars, so that the education group can provide them with moral and educational guidance, as well as teach them productive skills.

### Hand Grenade Explosion in Xinkang Lane Last Night

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern: I happened to read a news item in your newspaper dated March 27th, which is inconsistent with the facts. Since April of last year, after being appointed as the Fifth District Regiment Commander by the Headquarters of the Southeast National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army, until the end of his term, Mr. Hou Junren handled affairs according to the orders of his superiors and the opinions of local fair-minded gentry. There are no facts as stated in the report. There is evidence on file with the superiors, and justice remains in the locality, so there is no need to waste words. However, since it concerns the reputation of a private individual, I hereby request you to correct the report in order to avoid confusing the public. Sincerely, Hou Junren, March 9th.

### The Counteroffensive at This Stage

— Maolie

These few days, we have heard news of our army's counteroffensive, with victories being frequently reported. In Guangdong, Jiangcun and Jiujiang have been captured, and Guangzhou is surrounded. In Jiangxi, Gao'an and Dacheng have been captured, directly threatening Nanchang. As for southern Shanxi and central Hubei, enemies are being killed and results achieved everywhere, unfolding a very favorable situation. This is certainly gratifying, worthy of great joy and special joy. Because: First, it gives us a boost in spirit after the fall of Nanchang; second, it shatters the enemy's dream of flanking Changsha.

However, while we are pleased, we cannot but recognize the following two points:

First, the second phase of the War of Resistance is not the period of total counteroffensive. Our supreme authorities have already explained this in great detail. Therefore, the counteroffensive at this stage is not the prelude to the total counteroffensive. Do not expect it too early, and do not feel disappointed when you see the total counteroffensive being implemented late. The total counteroffensive will eventually be realized, but not now. Our supreme authorities must have a comprehensive plan and detailed arrangements, so we don't need to overthink it.

Second, we do have the ability to counterattack, just as we have the ability to defend. If we are determined to recover Hankou, Nanjing, Guangzhou, or any big city, we will certainly be able to do so. However, before the enemy's economic strength collapses completely, their morale completely declines, and their munitions are completely exhausted, such recovery is not very effective. Therefore, we still need to consistently wage a long-term war of attrition, relying on our unique endowments to deplete everything from the enemy. Once the time is ripe, we can naturally take them down in one fell swoop and restore all our territories!

For these two points, therefore, our current stage of the War of Resistance is still aimed at exhausting everything from the enemy. And the counteroffensive is one such means. If the enemy exerts its strength to attack a certain point, we also exert our strength to defend it. When we reach a certain level of exhaustion, we shift our positions, occupy a favorable situation, and inflict another blow on the enemy. At the same time, when the enemy is slack at a certain point, we take the opportunity to counterattack and eliminate them. We must try our best to harass them so that they cannot breathe. In other words, we must try our best to exhaust them. This is the meaning of the counteroffensive at this stage and its origin.

However, in any case, I believe that the enemy's depletion has now reached a considerable level, and our total counteroffensive must not be far away. Then, the good news of our army capturing a certain city or place can be determined to continue to come, and the appearance of the final victory, like the coming of summer after spring, is already close at hand.

### Inkstone

— Dongfang

At that time, I had not been back to my hometown for long, living the life of a recluse. All the books that were against my views had been thrown away or burned, leaving only a copy of Jiannan Poetry Manuscripts to accompany me in wasting away these painful days. The rain had stopped not long ago, and the whole courtyard was full of mud and water. The courtyard had been bombed, and the halls had become a large pile of rubble. Even in the cracks of the broken tiles, small grasses were sprouting. Spring was everywhere, but my heart was always winter, always a deep winter!

The child was covered in mud, spread his hands, and rushed in, shouting:

"The madman is coming!" He went around my desk, ran through the courtyard, jumped on the rubble, sprinkled his hands, and looked this way.

I stood up and welcomed him out of the room. A long-haired man staggered this way, his face haggard, his eyes staring straight ahead, holding something in his hand. His dirty old cotton robe was also splattered with mud. He nodded at me with a smile that was not a smile. I slightly dodged, and he stepped into the study. With a "pi" sound, his broken shoes squeezed a large pool of water on the floor. He sat down on the rattan chair at the door, stroked his sleeves, and raised the thing he was holding in his hand to his brow, saying:

"I'm here to ask you for advice. Don't think of me as a madman. We are old neighbors." Heat rose from his forehead and mouth in waves.

I went closer to look at the thing in his hand. It turned out to be a covered inkstone. He gently placed it on the table, opened the lid, and rubbed a dirty hand on the lid for a while, gradually rubbing out some words. As he rubbed, he said:

"You are Qing Yun-deyi, not often home. We are not familiar, but in fact, we are family friends, and neighbors. Look, this inkstone was brought back by my grandfather when he was traveling outside. The words on it were inscribed by your ancestor!

"I always don't understand why this poem is inscribed on this inkstone, and what is the connection between this poem and the inkstone? Look, 'Heavy curtains not rolled up, leaving incense fires burning,' clearly, 'Heavy curtains not rolled up, leaving incense fires burning,' a good sentence! But what does it have to do with the inkstone?"

I had already heard something about the madman. Not only were we family friends, but we were also classmates in childhood. However, because we had few opportunities to meet, we gradually became estranged. How many of our childhood classmates have ended up not recognizing each other? I heard that he had suffered a lot and his nerves had been affected. What he thought in his heart, he would say out loud, and people called him a madman behind his back. This return in the midst of war was even more severely stimulated, and he became more and more unpredictable. The children all loved to tease him, calling him to sing the song of fighting the devils. Before he finished singing, tears poured down. After he finished singing, he laughed heartily. This is someone who is heartbroken, so they call him a madman.

He did not want me to answer, and continued to speak to himself, bringing his nose close to the inkstone and sniffing it:

"This inkstone retains the indelible stench of blood, also to leave a trace of righteousness for our imperial descendants. Good young lady, you are really my daughter. You will not fear the strong, you will not be afraid of death, you will risk your life in danger, you will not disgrace your purity, you will grab this inkstone and smash the heads of the bandits! Good young lady, our ancestors are not far away, all attached to this inkstone, helping you kill the bandits! It's a pity that this throw was not heavy enough, and did not kill that beast. Instead, he pulled out his gun, ah! You ultimately suffered! There are so many hateful things! I can't be your dad, I can't protect you. I won't hide you in advance, I won't take you to escape, like they all use big ships to hide their belongings in the countryside. I didn't think that this was really possible! I am not as good as a dog, they dragged me around, made me sweep horse manure, carry planks, and even cursed at me. I wouldn't break their heads with the planks, I don't have that courage. I still want to live, I still want to come back and hide in the countryside with you. When I came back, the old grandma told me your story, ah, this inkstone still retains the stench of blood!"

This is not human speech, this is simply a wounded beast roaring and lamenting. His gloomy eyes pierced my heart like sharp blades. I had nothing to say.

"Now, the war is not being fought, look, the county magistrate is gone, the shops are open, and everyone is living happily again, humph, you can all be happy, I wish I could pick up the inkstone and smash all of your heads! Humph humph humph... The hand grabs the gold medal and the generals rush..."

He raised the inkstone, stood up, waved it in the air, strode out, dancing all the way. I looked at his back, my heart aching. This back is now so thin. I remembered when we were children, studying in the same hall, kicking shuttlecocks, throwing leather balls. He was always so strong, how majestic like a big rooster. Who knew that time would grind him into this state!

The child tugged at my hand and said:

"Dad, are you also crazy?"

I nodded and said:

"Ah, I'm really going crazy!"

### More and More Exciting

### The Creator's Path

— Dingdi

We are walking a difficult journey amidst hardship.

There is no road, no boundary marker, no paved bluestone, no stairs for climbing mountains. The journey is long and arduous! Don't you see that our heads are dripping with sweat and our hands and feet are calloused? Humankind's inherent wit, enthusiasm, and courage have been pre-allocated to us. We are using all our physical strength for a lion's struggle.

Wading through a long journey, a whole day, a whole night, a mountain over a river, our footsteps create a distant "broad road."

We stride across cliffs, we climb over precipices, we will wind through the nine bends of the goat's intestine, we will cut through the dense grass in the deep forest, we have sought water in the yellow sky for thousands of miles, we have listened to the startling wind on the bird path. We have experienced many dangers and difficulties, all fears seem indifferent, and miracles seem ordinary. History is filled with greatness and magnificence, our bodies, as tall as the sky, digging with hoes and shovels, neat ranks, let our sweat drip on the ground one by one, let us exchange hard work for a flat "broad road."

Without hardship, how can there be laughter? Wading through a long journey, a whole day, a whole night, a mountain over a river. Rocks tripped our steps, thorns pierced our toes, mud stained our clothes, we are haggard in the desert wind and sand, and trapped by wolves and tigers at night. One side staggers and falls on the dangerous road, while the other opens up a flat road for future travelers. Indeed, our work is hard. But, what does this matter? We each have a goal, we must cross the plains and climb the peak that is as high as the sky. At the top of the mountain, the end of the journey, there is a happy "paradise", where we can enjoy the free air, free ourselves from the shackles of pain, and recover from long-term fatigue.

From the beginning, this journey has never been opened up by anyone. A traveler often quietly rests in the ground because he cannot withstand the miasma or has no strength to kill poisonous snakes and beasts, exposing his white bones in the wilderness. The timid consider it a "dangerous path." Although they know that there is a happy peak, they ultimately have no courage to overcome these many dangers.

Therefore, the "dangerous path" has become a world where jackals run wild: the weak are preyed on by the strong, and the gentle are entrusted to greed and violence.

Thousands of years later, tens of thousands of years later, it is our turn to walk this difficult journey today. Not lazy, not discouraged, not surrendered, not pleading, stand up straight, take up my hoe and plow, open up a flat road, for ourselves, for our children and grandchildren, and for our friends.

The journey is long and arduous! There is no road, no boundary marker, no paved bluestone, no stairs for climbing mountains. From evil, we create justice; from nature, we carve ghostly workmanship and divine craftsmanship.

Don't worry about getting lost on a fork in the road, look at the peak that is already level with your eyebrows, and the paradise is also in sight. Don't rush, just use your last bit of strength, and you will have reached the peak.

Following our steps, the distant "broad road" is created, receding behind us. We have crossed the plains and climbed the peaks.

"A hard-working traveler is also a glorious creator!"

Later travelers will point to the "broad road" and thank their struggling predecessors.

### Heart Sacrifice

— Wu Qian

A bunch of wildflowers from the fields,

The cooking smoke from thousands of homes is the incense of the heart.

Tears have dried from anger,

Grief melts in the blood.

My sincere comrade-in-arms!

You gave everything to the motherland,

But it returns to you a generous gift;

The good news of victory is tomorrow,

The opportunity for revenge is today.

Friend - I use my conscience to offer a distant sacrifice to you.

### Leftover Talk

— Editor

Yesterday, the title of the first article in this journal, the "number" above should be placed above the word "anti" and not above the word "expand". We hereby correct this.

This journal does not accept classical Chinese; and vernacular Chinese must use new-style punctuation. Phrases and clauses cannot all use circles. Contributors, please take note.

In new-style punctuation, for every dialogue, the last punctuation mark must be placed inside the "or", not outside it, because the previous sentences are all inside it, and the last sentence should naturally also be inside it.

### Learning to Be Clever

— Geng Zhi

"A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit." Learning to be clever comes from suffering losses, which is a fundamental principle. Fundamental principles are of course good things, and I, a person of meager talent and virtue, would dare not heavily criticize them.

However, the cleverness I am talking about now is not the defensive kind that fears losses, but the proactive kind that seeks advantages. This "skill" does not necessarily come from "practice." Some are naturally gifted and born with it, while others have wise fathers and elder brothers who instruct them diligently. Thus, they grasp it instantly and understand it intuitively.

For example, don't interfere in matters that don't concern you. Their motto is: "Trouble arises from too much talking, and annoyance comes from sticking your neck out." "Each one sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs." Only do things that have rights, not obligations. Their principle is: "Eating your own rice and doing other people's work is foolish; working without reward, or suffering more loss than gain, is idiotic." They are very good at quoting scriptures, reciting a large number of theories that are not clever, and citing a large number of figures who are not clever. These theories are all proven ineffective, and these figures are all proven failures. (They say "less is required" and "it is best not to," which is one aspect of being clever, because within the scope of cleverness, there is no absolute right or wrong, as will be seen below.)

This is the passive aspect of being clever, directly opposed to being not clever. Precisely because one is not clever, one must learn, learning the active aspects of being clever. To learn and practice these things regularly, is not this delightful! How to learn? Where is the delight? Let's illustrate with examples:

Someone wants to use your great name as a founder or introducer, as long as they don't ask for your help or bother you. After you agree, it's a one-time effort, and it's published in advertisements, so you can get famous, so you might as well agree, whether it's a funeral home or a venereal disease doctor. Someone asks you to unveil or cut the ribbon, or to be an honorary judge. You don't have to say that you are not good at this or that you can't do anything, just perfunctorily go along with it, whether it's a dried tofu shop or a cigarette advertisement.

Someone asks you, China is not strong, is there no justice, you may as well respond with yes yes yes. Someone tells you that society is already civilized, and you may as well respond with yes yes yes. Or someone tells you that society is very dark, and you may as well respond with yes yes yes. Someone tells you that you, sir, are a great scholar, a great academic, and you might as well respond with yes yes yes, at most changing some words: undue praise, undue praise; I dare not, I dare not. Or even if someone insults you in person, calling you a liar, a swindler, or even a tortoise, you might as well respond with yes yes yes, all the way down... This one yes yes yes is truly like a panacea, with infinite uses, capable of making everyone who speaks to you feel calm and happy, and go away praising you as a person of peace and harmony—harmony brings wealth—calling you knowledgeable and reasonable, calling you insightful and far-sighted, calling you sharp-eyed and uniquely perceptive, calling you...

If you have to deal with some facts that you cannot do anything about or express any opinion on, what will you do? Well, there is also a consistent clever way to make people obedient.

Someone asks you for something, you can readily agree, and make every effort to say that a certain industry is good, a certain industry is better, and a certain industry is the best, and then on the spot call the big boss of the best industry, and write a letter of introduction. Someone hopes to work under you, you might as well readily agree, and whenever there is an opportunity, come and teach, come and take advantage, speak of leaving the recent correspondence address, speak of leaving the permanent correspondence address, and then bow once, bow again, clasp hands once, clasp hands again, and send them out of the gate. If they come to urge later, there is a record to check, and the same response can be used. Someone asks you to borrow money, you might as well readily agree, yes yes yes, but add a full explanation, that you don't have it now, and you won't have it in the future, that you are really very poor and very difficult, it is best to say it in such a way that the borrower is moved with compassion, and is quite willing to lend it back to you; then give them one or two yuan, or one or two mao, and send them out of the gate, and give them parting words: If I win the China Airlines raffle ticket, I will give you half of it. The visitor will surely leave relieved, not only without hatred, but also with gratitude and infinity.

In addition, there are many aspects of the clever way, which cannot be listed exhaustively: for example, advocating gradual revolution; it is okay to work hard in the rear in the Anti-Japanese War; it is possible to negotiate without demanding protest; be impartial, take the middle way; ... Whoever can have all these in mind, and understand them, is like a ball, which can roll everywhere, and go everywhere, because its exquisiteness is not only in all directions, but in the whole sphere, and if it hits the nose, it will turn around, and it will never push the cart against the wall, and break its head and bleed.

Such cleverness is learned, since there is no loss to suffer, so you can learn it down, and you don't have to calculate it one by one.

However, "clever" can also be interpreted as "incompatible," and I am a little afraid that if I learn it this way, I will end up in a "terrible situation!"

### Research on the Duration of Love Between Couples

This question is too serious. There are many couples who marry for love. In the early days of their marriage, they are so loving. But how long does it take? They fall out! Either the man has an affair outside the home, or the woman secretly enjoys love or even sues for divorce. As the saying goes, "Newlyweds are fragrant for three years, after three years, they are like a stinking outhouse." The psychology of men and women getting tired of the new and fond of the old is truly described vividly.

Looking at it another way, clothes are better when they are newer, and people are better when they are older. Old couples who accompany each other in their later years and live together until they are old are truly numerous in the world. Isn't it common for elderly couples who have been married for decades to still celebrate their silver or golden wedding anniversaries? At this time, the family is harmonious, the children and grandchildren are full, the relatives and friends are full, and they raise their hands to toast. How pleasant and happy! A lot of happiness, a lot of longevity, and a lot of sons are always praised in Chinese society. So, why is the love between couples not eternal and lasting, but short-lived for a time?

To speak frankly, couples are the union of men and women. Their love is completely built on the foundation of "spiritual and physical unity." If couples can pay attention to sexual hygiene after marriage and maintain the permanent health of their sexual functions, then if they marry for love, their love will surely last forever, with no end in sight. If it is a marriage arranged by a matchmaker, their love will continue to grow, and the intense love will be more in the future after marriage. In short, a couple, both healthy men and beautiful women, can always maintain their sexual health and even use [blank space] to create their love at any time. Without the temptation of a special environment, their love will not change halfway. If men and women have committed masturbation and seminal emission in their early years, or have suffered from wild indulgence and worrying after marriage, causing spermatorrhea and sperm leakage, premature ejaculation and impotence, neurasthenia, thin sperm and infertility, incomplete development, and scattered energy, under such circumstances, no matter how compatible their wills are, and how comfortable their lives and environment are, the love on one side is definitely not sustainable for long. Inevitably, love will gradually fade, and eventually lead to sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, and perform various tragedies between families! Smart husbands who want to restore love and realize their dreams again have only one way: to fundamentally cure their diseases. According to the experience of world-renowned doctors and myself, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Hormone" is the most effective and effective treatment. This agent can produce sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and promote blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. If it can be taken continuously, it will surely be able to completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, and it can prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemitol's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, so that the effect is even faster. However, if patients can come to this clinic for diagnosis by expert physicians, and apply various symptomatic treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, cure can be guaranteed.

### The Relationship Between Spermatorrhea and Brain Weakness and Insomnia

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

In this noisy city, in the short days and long nights of spring, if you suffer from insomnia that makes it difficult to sleep all night, it is the most painful thing. Because working all day is already very hard, and the blood is full of fatigue toxins, and at night you toss and turn and cannot sleep soundly, listening to the clock tick away second by second, and then the day will dawn and you will be driven back to work, how miserable! His health will inevitably decline day by day, and eventually become incurable!

Examining the causes of insomnia, although there are many, the most common is caused by spermatorrhea. When young people first enter the period of spring passion, due to ignorance and curiosity, they often have the bad habit of masturbation. After masturbating for a long time, because the nerves are destroyed, they often become weakened or even lose their effectiveness. Therefore, the opening and closing of the sperm gate cannot be controlled, and then spermatorrhea occurs. Once spermatorrhea occurs, if it is delayed and not treated, the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves will be severely hit. Therefore, symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and dreaminess, fear of烦虑, depressed aspirations, back pain, kidney deficiency and incompetence, scattered energy, and incomplete development follow one after another. Such a man is dazed all day long, as if he is sleeping but not sleeping, as if he is drunk but not drunk. Not only will he have no achievements in his career and academics, but he will also not be able to have a happy married life and will be hated by his wife! Or even premature aging, early death, wasting this life! The only remedy, according to the experience of world-renowned doctors and myself, is to take "Hemitol's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" to consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves. Not only can you get sleep, but you can also fundamentally cure spermatorrhea. If the above-mentioned symptoms have been caused by spermatorrhea, you must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you can continue to take it, you will surely be able to completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, and it can prolong life and rejuvenate.

### Breasts Are the Source of Women's Happiness

— American Doctor of Medicine Yao Chongpei

Rather be mandarin ducks than envy immortals. Enjoy the blissful years in a close-knit family. If you suffer from painful breasts due to illness, seek scientific treatment without delay!

In the modern trend, to be a modern woman and be worthy of being called "beautiful," you must pay attention to your health, and especially pay attention to the development of your breasts! Because now men and women look at women, they don't look at their heads and feet. Two lightning-like eyes shoot at your chest. If they see your pair of breasts, rising and falling together when you move, with a full show-off posture, then even if the face is worse, it doesn't matter. On the other hand, if your breasts are like deflated balloons, loose and shriveled, then even if your face looks like Lin Daiyu or Zhao Feiyan, you can't win their favor, and they will even ridicule you coldly! As for women who consider themselves smart, they do not hesitate to mix pearls with fish eyes and wear bras, but when the curtain of the spring boudoir comedy opens, they still waste their efforts in vain, and their true colors are revealed. As a result, they are ashamed and men are disgusted! Feelings break down and tragedies occur!

So why do women's breasts shrivel? According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologist Kandending and others, it is believed that it is caused by masturbation, chest binding, irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, and postpartum weakness, which damage the function of the ovaries. The only remedy is to actively take the ovarian preparation "Germinal Hormone" for women, which is the most effective and effective treatment. This agent is well-prepared, and it can nourish the ovarian function, promote metabolism, and regulate menstruation within one day and night after taking it. It warms the womb and stops leucorrhea. If you continue to take it, it can not only make shriveled breasts become high and firm, but also make a haggard face become plump and rosy, revealing a bright luster from the muscles, charming and moving.

### Unintentionally Transitioning to Chronic Gonorrhea

The reason why acute symptoms in the initial stage often unintentionally transition to chronic gonorrhea, according to the results of my years of experience, is that in addition to gonococci, there are also many other bacteria mixed in, especially those caused by bacilli. Patients feel urethral discomfort, itching, or slight pain, and begin to seek medical treatment. However, because the symptoms are mild, patients often delay treatment and health preservation, so unknowingly, gonococci enter the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra, leading to prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, cystitis, and systemic infectious arthritis, and then they realize that their illness has not only not healed, but has become worse.

Sometimes, in these cases, the urine is not completely turbid, and is mostly transparent, or slightly with a little gonorrhea only. But in fact, in these places, it is constantly unintentionally transmitted to the opposite sex, so wives have advised husbands, and it is especially necessary to pay attention to the symptoms of this chronic gonorrhea and seek immediate cure. Whenever you encounter these symptoms, you must use urine culture for repeated examinations, or perform prostate massage, and examine the liquid that flows out under a microscope. You will definitely be able to find gonococci and other bacilli, and determine the location of gonorrhea, and then treat according to the symptoms, so that you can be successful in every treatment. In terms of treatment methods, the German Lymph Filtration Electrotherapy is the first choice, because the conductor is inserted into the inside of the urethra, and then the degree of electricity is opened according to the severity of the condition, so that the bactericidal power directly penetrates the lesion, and is just right. And choose the German Hiss Serum to resist gonorrhea and kill bacteria. Other methods such as washing, massage, cooling, and warming can be applied according to the symptoms, so that all such chronic gonorrhea can be cured in four or five weeks.

### The Humble Opinion that Internists Should Pay Attention to Fundus Examination

— Shen Jinxiang

The development of modern medicine is changing with each passing day. Internal medicine treatment also requires precise diagnosis first. If the diagnosis is accurate and the treatment is appropriate, then the disease will naturally go away. In addition to asking about past symptoms and investigating current symptoms, the methods of diagnosis can be roughly divided into physical examination, chemical examination, microscopic examination, and blood serum and immunological examination. However, fundus examination can be very helpful for internal medicine diagnosis. In my clinical practice, I have seen cases of latent beriberi, with extremely mild systemic symptoms, but axial optic neuritis has already been found in the fundus. In the early stage of spinal cord disease, there is often obvious unilateral optic nerve atrophy in the fundus. Before the onset of cerebral hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage and white spots are often seen. The discovery of fundus changes in patients with nephritis often has a poor prognosis, and most of them die within one or two years. The above examples can prove the importance of fundus examination in internal medicine diagnosis. This is my humble opinion. I don't know if the experts in the medical field think it is correct.

### Breastfeeding Obstacles and Weaning (i.e. Stopping Breastfeeding)

— Wang Jicheng

Infants are breastfeeding infants in the year after birth, and most of the nutrition taken in during this period is milk.

Nutritional issues during childhood are even more important than for adults. Infants take in nutrition not only to preserve their lives, but also to undertake a great task in terms of growth. Therefore, infant nutrition issues are very important, regardless of the situation, and especially when treating diseases, if nutrition is neglected, treatment will absolutely not succeed. Looking at the statistics, we know that the biggest cause of mortality in infants is digestive system diseases, and the mortality rate of infants nourished with artificial milk is greater than that of those nourished with human milk, so we can see the importance of nutrition in the task of breastfeeding.

1. Breastfeeding Obstacles

Natural nutrition (i.e. human milk nutrition) is the most ideal food for milk babies and has all the excellent nutritional effects. According to statistics, the mortality rate in the infant period is a shockingly high rate of 10-17%, and there are more infants who practice artificial nutrition than those who practice natural nutrition, so how should infant nutrition be handled? Here, we can decide on a direction, and the superiority of natural nutrition over artificial nutrition can also be known here. The impact is not only on the infant period, but also has a great relationship with all future life. For example, strong resistance to various diseases, and reduced morbidity and mortality are all examples. Therefore, except in special circumstances, breastfeeding infants must use breast milk. If you rashly cut off breast milk for your own convenience and switch to artificial nutrition, it is really not possible and must be carefully considered. This matter is not only related to the interests of one person and one family, but also a very important issue for the country, society, and national health.

When breast milk cannot be used, you should also choose wet nurse milk. If that is not possible, you can implement artificial nutrition, and you should pay full attention.

So, under what circumstances should a temporary or semi-permanent interruption of breastfeeding be implemented? This is necessary knowledge for child rearers, and I will select the essentials to describe below. A. Due to reasons on the mother's side

(1) Beriberi It is a difficult question to decide whether to interrupt breastfeeding when the mother's body discovers beriberi symptoms. Usually, there are not few misunderstandings. However, when a baby is nourished with breast milk from a mother with beriberi, it is not only possible for the baby to develop beriberi, but it is also often seen. It is not necessarily the case that the child will definitely develop beriberi symptoms. On the other hand, even if the mother's body has no beriberi symptoms, the child often develops beriberi symptoms. So, how should we deal with the mother's body when beriberi occurs? That is, if the baby already has beriberi, breastfeeding should be stopped immediately. If the baby does not have beriberi, please ask a doctor to examine its course. If the situation permits, it should still continue breastfeeding. If the mother's beriberi is mild, and the baby also has slight diarrhea and vomiting, it is wrong to rashly stop breastfeeding for this kind of inconclusive reason and switch to artificial nutrition, which will lead to nutritional disorders and the transformation of death, as has been seen many times. Therefore, no matter what, the issue of breastfeeding interruption for maternal beriberi must be given special attention, repeatedly considered, and must not be carried out carelessly.

Also, when the child already has beriberi symptoms

(This beriberi is mostly the cardiac type, and the symptoms are very serious), it is often implemented with a temporary breastfeeding interruption, and changed to artificial nutrition. After appropriate treatment, the beriberi symptoms have disappeared, and then gradually transition to breastfeeding, and gradually decide to fully adopt breast milk.

At this time, if you do not transition to breastfeeding, but instead permanently change to artificial nutrition, it is not the right strategy.

(2) Syphilis If the mother's body is infected with syphilis immediately before or after delivery, breastfeeding is prohibited. Although the mother's body is infected with syphilis at the time immediately before or after delivery, the produced child has not been infected. The breast milk of a mother with syphilis after childbirth should not be used to feed the child, so as to avoid continuing to infect the child. In addition, even for mothers who are syphilitic but whose children appear outwardly healthy, they can still breastfeed, because healthy children of syphilitic mothers have immunity to syphilis infection from breast milk (Profeta's Law). Also, the breast milk of mothers who do not have syphilis can breastfeed their syphilitic children, because syphilitic children inherited from the father's body cannot transmit syphilis to the mother's body, because their mothers have already acquired immunity to syphilis during pregnancy (Colle's Law). On the other hand, it is wrong if the child appears outwardly healthy, but breastfeeding is stopped because the mother's syphilis symptoms are obvious. Also, when syphilitic children need to choose a wet nurse, you must pay full attention, because it is not impossible for syphilitic children to transmit syphilis to healthy wet nurses.

Clinical Report

### Experience in Diagnosing and Treating Pneumonia Complicated by Diphtheria (Continued from Issue 10)

— Zhou Zhenyu

Treatment Process: At that time, the diagnosis was pneumonia complicated by diphtheria. According to the symptoms of labored breathing, surgery should have been performed to cut open the trachea to ease breathing. However, all instruments, such as Tracheotomy Cunula, were not prepared. It was late at night, making it difficult to arrange. Therefore, a prescription was immediately written to purchase 20,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin to treat the diphtheria. For the pneumonia, Antiphlogistine was applied to the chest, and M&B 693 tablets were prescribed, starting with two tablets, followed by one tablet every four hours, each tablet being half a gram, and Coramine five drops every two hours to maintain the heart. When the medicine arrived at 2:15 AM, the diphtheria antitoxin and Sparto-Cumphre were immediately injected. Seeing that the child had taken two tablets, I left the house, which was already 4:00 AM. At 4:00 PM, I went for a follow-up visit, but at 12:00 PM, I received a phone call inviting me for a house call, which I immediately went to. Upon examination, the rectal temperature was 103.2°F, the pulse was 125, and the respiration was 40. The parents were alarmed because when the child closed his eyes, only the whites of the eyes were visible, and the face was pale, seeming worse than before, so they urgently requested a consultation. 1cc of Sparto-Cumphre was injected, and the parents were told that the current condition should not be regarded as a dangerous sign, and if there was further improvement in the afternoon, the need for surgery could be waived. At 6:00 PM, I went for another examination. The temperature and pulse remained mostly unchanged, but the breathing was more comfortable, and the frequency of mouth breathing had decreased. Because the weather was cold and there was no stove in the room, I did not examine the lungs in detail. Although rales were present, they were not as loud as before. The airflow seemed smoother. After another injection of 1cc of Sparto-Cumphre, I left the house.

On the morning of the 16th, at 10:00 AM, I was again invited for an examination. It was reported that the child had not slept all night and now seemed tired and wanted to sleep, opening his mouth once every half hour. The rales were even lighter, and the child seemed more mentally fatigued than before. The medicine had been taken on time, and there were no other reports.

Visual Examination: The child was noticeably weaker, the face was still as pale as the day before, the nostrils were flaring, but less vigorously, and the forceful breathing was not as frequent as before. I only saw the child take one forceful breath, tightly clenching his hands without arching his chest, which indicated that his breathing was smoother. The rectal temperature was 101.5°F, the pulse was 100—, somewhat stronger but still weak, and the respiration was 35. Rales were still present, but the pitch was not as high as the previous two days.

Percussion: Hollow sounds were present in all diseased areas of the lungs, but the left lung still had solid sounds, although the hollow sound component was greater.

Auscultation: The diseased area of the right lung seemed to have cleared up, and the breath sounds were slightly higher than in the unaffected area. In the diseased area of the left lung, crackling sounds were heard, and the pitch was also higher.

The mouth was pried open with a mouth gag to examine the size of the diphtheria pseudomembrane. The pseudomembrane on the left side was lighter in color and smaller in shape than before. The pseudomembrane on the right side was also smaller and thinner, and the color was also lighter. It did not seem to significantly obstruct breathing, so the breathing sound was more relaxed. I told the parents that based on the examination results, the condition seemed to be improving. Another 10,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin and 1cc of Sparto-Cumphre were injected, and the other medications were not changed. I scheduled another examination for the afternoon. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, I went to the house and found the child had been asleep for one and a half hours.

Visual Examination: Breathing was smoother, with phlegm sounds, but upon careful listening, the sound in the airway was still rales, while the sound in the lungs was phlegm. The rectal temperature was 99.6°F, the pulse was 94, and the respiration was 30. The chest ointment was removed, and the lungs were examined. All symptoms in the right lung seemed to have disappeared, and the left lung had slight symptoms, so the medication was changed to one tablet every six hours and Coramine five drops every four hours. A visit was scheduled for the afternoon of the following day.

On the afternoon of the 17th, I went at 4:00 PM and learned that the child had slept well at night, the facial pallor had slightly subsided, the rectal temperature was 99°F, the pulse was 78, and the respiration was 28. Examination of the lungs revealed that the right lung was normal, and the left lung had slight crackling sounds, with no other signs.

On the afternoon of the 18th, at 4:00 PM, I went for an examination and found the child playing, wanting to eat, and asking his parents what he should eat, etc. The rectal temperature was 99°F, the pulse was 74, and the respiration was 27. Although the facial pallor had not completely subsided, the complexion had improved, so I instructed that after the tablets were finished, to switch to a bottle of Nestrovit Enmlsion for nourishment.

Discussion: The illness began as pneumonia. The Chinese medicine practitioner's misunderstanding, using the theory of "evil fire" to explain the pathology, was absurd. That there was a foreign object in the airway obstructing airflow and calling it "stasis phlegm," and the parents believing it, was even more bizarre and ridiculous. Such misinformation that cost people their lives was truly tragic. Fortunately, the father had been cured by me before, so he had some faith in me, but the mother was quite skeptical and repeatedly questioned me during the consultation, even defending the Chinese medicine practitioner. Alas! The harm caused by people in our country not believing in science is truly not insignificant.

The cure of diphtheria is certainly due to the effectiveness of the antitoxin, which we have long known, so I will not elaborate. As for the treatment of pneumonia, to whom should the credit be attributed? I dare to ask for a clarification. We all know that treating pneumonia is fraught with difficulties, and even if it can be cured, it is not so easy. Upon examination, the child suffered from Stage II pneumonia in the right lung and Stage I in the left lung. In the shortest possible time, the ability to turn the crisis into safety, in my opinion, should be attributed to the M&B 693 tablets. M&B 693 is an artificial drug, also known as Dagenan. It is a compound of Pyridine and the widely publicized chain bacteria-destroying drugs Sulphaniiamide or Sulphonamidep. Its complete chemical name is 2(Amino-PhenyISnlPhonamido)Pyridine. The UK has repeatedly praised its effectiveness in treating pneumonia, as recorded in the Lancet medical journal, so I adopted it. When the child took four tablets, the temperature began to drop, and by seven or eight tablets, the pneumonia gradually subsided. By eleven or twelve tablets, the disease had decreased by more than half. The greatness of its sterilization ability can be imagined. However, whether the temperature drop is a result of its sterilization ability or whether it itself has a fever-reducing effect has not been studied and I dare not say for sure. We are well aware that both diphtheria and pneumonia are detrimental to the heart, so using Coramine and injecting Sparlo-Cnmphre and other drugs has no direct relationship to the treatment of pneumonia.

Conclusion: (1) In clinical practice, if there is a suspicion of diphtheria, diphtheria antitoxin should be injected immediately. The number of units should be a fraction that neutralizes the diphtheria toxin, but there is no need to wait for the report. Even if the report confirms it as diphtheria, injecting diphtheria antitoxin will not cause any harm.

(2) There are too few effective drugs for treating pneumonia. Now there is a new drug, M&B 693. Even if M&B 693 is not confirmed as a specific drug for treating pneumonia, it should be tried. The dosage should initially be two tablets, then reduced, because it has the side effect of nausea. Therefore, on the first day, I prescribed seven tablets, and on the second day, six tablets. Seeing that the disease was receding, I immediately changed to four tablets to avoid nausea and vomiting.

(3) Antitoxin and M&B 693 do not conflict, so they can be used concurrently. Patients taking M&B 693 should avoid Epsom salts (Maguesium Sulphate) or eating eggs to prevent changes in the blood. (The End)

### Hookworm Disease (Conclusion)

— Suo Fei

Mr. Gu has been anxious about his youngest son for the past few days. He feels that if he continues like this, the illness may worsen. Looking at such a big belly, he doesn't know what is hidden inside. If this thing is not removed, it may be a burden on his little Qian's life. Although he was anxious day and night, he never thought of asking a doctor to investigate. It was his beloved wife's words that reminded him, and made him feel a little grateful. Yes, he should ask a doctor to come. Mr. Gu immediately agreed with Mrs. Gu's suggestion.

The doctor carefully examined Little Qian again and again, and also tested his blood and stool.

According to the doctor's opinion: Although Little Qian is so thin and slightly feverish, his spleen is not enlarged, and his liver seems normal. There are no suspicious parasites in his blood, so it is definitely not malaria. However, a parasitic worm called a hookworm egg was found in his stool. The child has hookworm disease.

Hookworm is a small intestinal parasite that is only three to five millimeters long. The male worm is smaller, and the female worm is larger. Living hookworms are transparent throughout the body and are slightly pinkish, but some are slightly black. The body of dead hookworms is no longer transparent and turns gray or grayish-yellow. Although male and female worms can be distinguished by their size in appearance, the male worm has a mating bursa at the end of its tail, which is a slightly expanded membranous organ. This is the definite distinction between male and female worms. If they are placed under a microscope, in addition to the general phenomena common to nematodes, there are two pairs of sharp, hook-like teeth on the ventral side inside and outside their oral cavity. These sharp, hook-like teeth are used to hook and bite the intestinal wall of the host.

Hookworms parasitize in the human small intestine, but when the Italian Dubini discovered it in 1883, it happened to be parasitizing in the duodenum, so it was called the duodenal worm. In fact, it parasitizes in the upper part of the small intestine, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and its traces can be found everywhere, not just in the duodenum. Hookworms parasitize in the small intestine, using their sharp, hook-like teeth to bite the intestinal wall, sucking very strongly and not easily falling off. For this reason, the intestinal wall is often destroyed and bleeds, and sometimes even blood can be seen in the worm's body.

Hookworm is just one of the various intestinal parasites of the human body. Although it is not necessarily the smallest among the various intestinal parasites, it is the most harmful to the human body. Because when hookworms parasitize in the small intestine and multiply to a number of thirty or forty, people will suffer damage and become ill. If they multiply to hundreds or thousands, the disease will be very serious and dangerous. The harm of hookworm begins with disturbances in the digestive system, gradually leading to abdominal distension and heartburn, nausea from time to time, gradual malnutrition, anemia, gradual difficulty in breathing, palpitations, gradual colloid edema, fatigue in movement, ... and eventually death due to anemia and nutritional disorders.

Although the appetite of hookworm patients does not change significantly, there is a clear change in preferences, with an unusual liking for foreign objects. Therefore, there are often cases of peeling and eating wall soil, charcoal, paper scraps, cloth pieces, fingernails, etc., and even suddenly liking spicy wine, salt, raw rice, and other things that are not usually liked. In addition to changes in preferences, hookworm patients also have a significant unique symptom, which is the deformation of the nails. The entire nail is pale white, thin and brittle, with the leading edge slightly turned upward, and the entire surface is wavy and uneven. Patients with other intestinal parasites do not have this phenomenon.

Although hookworm infestation is not limited to age, children are more harmed than adults because children are in a period of development, and hookworms can significantly hinder the child's physical development, which affects the development of intelligence, turning them into a child who appears to be mentally retarded. This is not only a loss for the individual patient, but also a loss for society and the country. The Rockefeller Foundation's Health Commission in the United States once investigated 548,992 children in farm families in various countries, and the results showed that 39% of them had hookworm disease. This number cannot be said to be not alarming!

The route of human infection with hookworm disease is not necessarily oral; its main route of transmission is through the skin of the human body. Because after the eggs of hookworms are excreted from the human body, they can hatch into larvae in water or in wetlands when they encounter a suitable temperature in two or three days. These larvae swallow waste and gradually grow. After two or three days, they begin to molt. After another four or five days, a new skin grows under the old skin. Their old skin does not fall off, but is moved to form a cyst, becoming an encysted larva. This encysted larva no longer needs to feed and quietly waits for the opportunity to enter the human body in water or wetlands. If a child or adult accidentally walks barefoot in water or wetlands mixed with hookworm encysted larvae, the hookworm larvae can penetrate the skin and enter the human body to begin harming it.

The process of hookworms in the human body is very interesting. After the encysted larvae penetrate from the skin, they enter the heart along the blood vessels or lymphatic route, and then from the heart to the lungs. After a certain period of development, they then exit through the throat, enter the esophagus, pass through the stomach, and reach the small intestine, where they gradually grow into adult worms. Although some larvae that have reached the lungs may also directly penetrate the intestinal wall into the intestine with blood flow, just like swallowing the larvae orally into the stomach and intestines and then turning to the lungs for a tour, this is not the normal route. The proper way for hookworms to invade the human body has such an interesting history. Their certain development work must be completed in the lungs, which is also an interesting characteristic of the life history of hookworms.

Hookworm eggs are oval in shape and have a transparent and thin eggshell, usually with four egg cells. They are easily identifiable under a microscope. If a human body is infected with hookworm disease, hookworm eggs can definitely be detected in the stool.

It is more difficult to expel hookworms than to expel any other intestinal parasite because hookworms are sucking worm-like nematodes, and also nematode-like sucking worms, and are in the upper part of the small intestine, which cannot be expelled by ordinary deworming drugs. To achieve the purpose of expelling hookworms, it is necessary to take drugs such as thymol, ethylamine, anethole oil, oil of chenopodium, and carbon tetrachloride. However, these drugs are very toxic, and if one is not careful, they will be poisoned. It is especially important to be careful with medication for young children.

IV

From the doctor, Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu learned about hookworm disease, and their hearts became heavier. They were worried about Little Qian's body, and even more worried about the crisis of the remaining four children.

After the doctor's reminder, Mr. Gu remembered that when he went to the countryside to bring back Little Qian, he did see Little Qian walking barefoot in wetlands or dirty water, getting his whole body very dirty. In the countryside, not only Little Qian was like this, but almost all rural people walked barefoot everywhere. This phenomenon, this habit, has been cultivated since their distant ancestors. Who would pay attention to the fact that this made the source of the disease? Although rural people do not have this knowledge, hookworms are too good at taking advantage.

After confirming that Little Qian had hookworm disease and knowing that this annoying hookworm disease was transmitted from the dirty soil in the countryside, Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu had several quarrels. Mr. Gu blamed Mrs. Gu for having too many children, which caused her to suffer. Mrs. Gu blamed Mr. Gu for not having knowledge, which caused her beloved youngest son to be infected with such a troublesome disease from the countryside. However, quarreling in vain is of no use after all. In the end, they still worked together to save Little Qian's health.

Following the doctor's instructions, they first nursed Little Qian's body back to health. When his strength recovered slightly, they carefully took deworming drugs, and many grayish-white hookworms that were almost invisible to the naked eye were purged.

It took a full two months before Little Qian became energetic and lively, and his body became plump, no longer strangely shaped.

At this time, Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu's worry about their beloved son was slightly relieved.

### Starting from Banning Love Movies

— Xin Yi

When a person or a country is at their wit's end, they will find trivial and insignificant matters to deal with, as a temporary relief from the tense mood, to relieve the depression accumulated in their hearts. The recent Japanese government's ban on young people watching love movies is the most obvious example.

On the 6th of this month, a Haidong telegram reported: The Japanese Minister of Education, Araki, yesterday met with the film industry to explain the new law passed by the government, banning young people across the country from watching love movies. Judging from the meaning of the words "love movies," we may think that they have a bad influence that could harm the body and mind of young people. However, in today's Japan, which is filled with a very abnormal atmosphere and permeated with the smell of gunpowder, we have to have another interpretation of the Japanese government's ban on young people watching love movies.

Since the Japanese warlords launched the war of aggression against China, the whole country has been almost as if they were crazy. They have restricted public opinion, suppressed freedom of thought, and implemented their strict control policies by various means, so as to make every citizen numbly obey the magical hands of the warlords and be driven and slaughtered by them. The first to be sacrificed were the Japanese youth. Under the claws of fascism, the suffering that the Japanese youth have experienced is probably greater than at any other time.

Of course, the Japanese youth, like the youth of our country, have surging blood and emotions and need to burst out to satisfy their desire to pursue freedom and justice. However, they have been blinded and suffocated by their warlords. Their lives can no longer find light and heat, and they can no longer breathe fresh air. They are miserably groaning in this dark and gloomy cellar.

Now, their warlords have once again used the fine name of eliminating the bad influence on young people to formulate a new law prohibiting young people from watching love movies, in an attempt to give their failing conclusion to the war of aggression against China a chance to cover it up. They want to change the mentality of the youth of the whole country, so that they blindly discard all emotional factors and accept the narrow so-called patriotic ideology, and bravely participate in their so-called war to "build a new order in East Asia." In the hearts of their warlords, their "wartime system" should be widely and rapidly applied to all sectors of society. They almost want to instill the knowledge of airplanes, artillery, and tanks into the hearts of every young person, so that they discard their innate emotional factors and everyone becomes a fierce and brutal "glorious" executioner. The pitiful Japanese youth are heading to the grave under this irresistible pressure, against the process of the evolution of the times and history.

As far as prohibiting young people from watching love movies is concerned, on the good side, it can of course reduce the temptation of various sexual behaviors and improper hints between men and women; but love movies still have an undeniable value for the active meaning of life. Movies are art, and they use the screen to express the truthfulness of human emotions. We can clearly see from the writings of ancient and modern Chinese and foreign writers and poets the fact that mankind has created many undertakings in pursuit of love. A world without love is cold, selfish, and mutually murderous. We seek some of the essence of life from movies (often referring to excellent love movies) to relax our tense mood and the tricks and frauds of the world. As Hakuson Kurukawa said, "using art to express depressed emotions and increase the vitality of life," which should be the right of every passionate young person?

I remember there is such a passage in the book "Admonitions for Youth" translated by Liang Yunli: "Our strength and soundness are determined by the degree to which we develop love. ... If we are full of love, no matter how terrible the situation, we can cope with it and overcome it; if we have no love, then we are helpless and incompetent." Therefore, as long as we understand the active and noble meaning of love, we can definitely expand from narrow love to human sympathy and universal love, and we can also get the motivation to develop undertakings and create undertakings.

When the invaders are unable to hide their mistakes and want to temporarily ease the contradictions and conflicts in their minds, they vent their depression on the youth. What kind of feelings should we have when we see that the right of Japanese youth to watch love movies is being deprived?

### Please Housewives Take Note: The Secrets of the Cigarette and Exchange Shops

— Jing Ming

"Young mistress, at the cigarette paper shop across the street corner, one dollar is exchanged for a full 100 cents."

One day, my family's old nanny said to my wife. This was naturally good news. Although one dollar was only short one cent, the family was very attentive to the whereabouts of one or two copper coins. That day during lunch, the people in the kitchen were all talking about that cigarette paper shop; someone even immediately gave another example, saying that their soap was one copper coin cheaper than the cigarette paper shop at the intersection.

The owners of Shanghai cigarette paper shops are all extremely shrewd. They bring in goods wholesale and sell them retail, and their profit lies in the coming and going of one or two copper coins. In the past, when small silver coins were used, it was not uncommon for the exchange rates they posted to differ by three or four copper coins. Therefore, someone had calculated that if you exchanged one dollar for copper coins, and then exchanged the silver coins for copper coins, the amount you lost would shock you. After the government issued the legal tender system, exchanging one dollar for 99 cents was considered "government business" to them, with no benefit. Now that cigarette paper shop was exchanging a full one dollar for 100 cents; this was truly a miracle!

Generally, Shanghai residents have to exchange money when they go to the small vegetable market in the morning. Since this news spread, everyone was willing to walk a few more steps to exchange money there. As time went on, even business transactions started to go to that shop. I sometimes heard the nannies of various families talking, saying that their goods were indeed cheaper than the other cigarette and exchange shops. Therefore, one day when I passed by their shop, I couldn't help but take a look at the counter. A chubby person was greeting customers with a beaming smile; it seemed he was the owner. I couldn't deny that I was also tempted by the small advantage, and later I often transacted business there, such as buying cigarettes.

In my impression, he was a typical businessman, with a face full of smiles. Whether you bought a pack of cigarettes or a needle, he always greeted you thoughtfully. Shanghai is a difficult place to make a living. On any given street, there are two, three, four, or five cigarette and exchange shops. To compete, naturally selling things cheaply is the first thing, but being amiable is also a way to make money.

However, recently I discovered a secret. It turned out that our old nanny was collecting single copper coins every day. Although everything is expensive now, the opportunity to use copper coins is rare. However, copper coins are still used for calculations in the small vegetable market, so she naturally has more opportunities to collect copper coins when she goes to the small vegetable market every day. When I came home every night, if I happened to have single copper coins in my pocket, I would always pick them out and put them in the purse for buying vegetables the next day, because we rarely need single copper coins when we take the bus and shop every day. Our old nanny was collecting them every day. When I discovered this situation and asked her, she told me: "In that cigarette and exchange shop, 280 single copper coins can be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender!"

Upon closer inspection, it turned out that the cigarette and exchange shop was using cheap goods and amiable service to buy copper coins from those nannies. Exchanging 280 coins for one yuan is naturally a good deal for the nannies, but why does the cigarette and exchange shop want to collect single copper coins?

Therefore, please all Shanghai housewives pay attention to whether your family's nanny is being exploited by unscrupulous merchants.

### Spring Break Reflections

— (Zhen Hui)

Qingming has passed by without my noticing it. I didn't even buy a few willow branches to stick in a vase — precisely because I rarely see willow branches, I even forgot Qingming.

The so-called "foreign Qingming," Good Friday, made people aware because most businesses had a four-day spring break.

"A tree a thousand feet tall, its leaves return to the root" certainly places too much emphasis on the concept of homeland, but not forgetting one's origin is always a virtue of a gentleman. During Qingming, going to the ancestral graves to offer sacrifices and burn paper money, thinking that ancestors can actually receive something, is superstition, but from understanding the past to creating the future, there is no lack of subtle meaning to be extracted from it. Taking the opportunity of this sacrifice to go to the suburbs for a stroll, relaxing one's mind, this enjoyment cannot be compared to other time-wasting and job-interfering pastimes.

The so-called spring break of foreign Qingming is an opportunity for the salaried class who are usually confined to the office to travel. The railway authorities have special travel trains during the spring break. Suzhou and Hangzhou, known as "paradise," are crowded with tourists.

But what about this year? Paradise has fallen into hell. Tourists are trapped in the coal ash piles of the "isolated island." Even playing in the park carries the great danger of disappearing nearby.

The paper money for ancestral graves cannot be burned, stealing half a day of leisure and thinking of going to the nearby suburbs like Longhua to relax has become an impossible luxury — Longhua Temple still has the same "gods and men are angry" face, right?

Our current war of resistance is closely related even to love, eating, and games. Many travelers who wanted to travel during the spring break are trapped on the smoky "isolated island." That's just a small example.

If the ancestral tombs are occupied by others, and one's own actions are restricted by others, and one is still complacent, unaware of shame and pain, then unless this person was born a slave, otherwise, he would not be indifferent.

So, how will you prepare for your spring break travel next year?

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Chapter 7: Young Swallows and New Orioles, Images of a Double-Edged Sword; Yue Luo Wu Brocade Machine Weaves Seven Patterns

When Zhu Aiqun first arrived in Freedom Village, everything was in its initial stages, and there were not many pregnant women. There were only a few houses, and only one or two maternity rooms. Now it was very different from before. After expansion and further expansion, Aiqun alone couldn't manage it, and Doctor Zhang repeatedly sent assistants. As the villagers of Freedom Village increased, so did the number of pregnant women, which was only to be expected. Therefore, what Zhu Ai-ren said the other day, wasn't it that they were planning to set up a branch of the Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital in Freedom Village? As a result, Ai-ren thought that since she couldn't accompany them in Freedom Village, she could ask Aiqun to take care of them. So, she told Shuangyu and Liyu about it. Liyu said, "Right now, we don't need much care. We would be grateful if you could just introduce us to a place where we can eat and sleep. Once we arrive in Freedom Village, we can enjoy complete freedom. Free to play, free to visit, to inspire free thought, and breathe free air. We don't need anyone to entertain us; we are already extremely free." Shuangyu also said, "When we first arrived in Anle Town, you also said that you were afraid you wouldn't be able to accompany us often, and you felt very sorry. But after we arrived for only a few days, several sisters have already become very familiar with us. They all treat us very sincerely. Even old Doctor Zhang is very kind and treats us like nieces. I think it will definitely be the same when we arrive in Freedom Village. It's like how old Mr. Zhu treats us like granddaughters, and how Madam treats us like daughters. I know your family always treats people with utmost loyalty and sincerity." Zhu Ai-ren said, "Even so, you are still guests after all. With my older sister Aiqun taking care of you, I can feel at ease." They planned to take Zhu Ai-ren's car to Freedom Village on Sunday. They were happy to play in Freedom Village for a few days. Otherwise, they would return in the same car, and could go again the following week. At this time, the two Misses He had also completed the plan for establishing a silk weaving factory in two evenings. They sent it to their father by express mail so that their father could revise it. Perhaps some forces were involved. Mr. He also had to consult with his friends. Since they had already agreed to establish such a silk weaving factory between Zhejiang and Shanghai, they must have had a plan in mind. It would probably take several weeks to discuss back and forth. They could take their time to find a factory site while playing in Freedom Village. But on Friday afternoon, Zhu Ai-ren received a phone call from Wu Junsu, saying: "Tomorrow, Saturday evening, the drama club in our school will perform a play. Please, you and the two Misses He must come. I have also invited Sister Feng Yun, and she has already agreed to come. You must come. If you don't, I will be very disappointed." It was exactly as they said:

Just when friends were about to drive away together, good friends persuade them to come. (84)

### A Casual Discussion on Three-Primary-Color Panchromatic Films

— Xin Ying

The invention of three-primary-color panchromatic films is a major revolution in film history after the prevalence of sound films. Recently, "Wings Together," which was screened in Nanjing, is MGM's first three-primary-color panchromatic film; at the same time, it is said that the Soviet Union's first three-primary-color panchromatic film, "The Nightingale," will also be screened in Shanghai soon. Here, the writer wants to write down the various situations of three-primary-color films below to inform readers.

Three-Primary-Color Films

The current panchromatic films are different in color compared with the previous films. The current ones are much more advanced. The main reason is that the previous color films were shot using two primary colors. Three-primary-color films were invented in 1932, and it took the careful research of many people to achieve success.

Natural Color Films

The so-called natural color film is actually a three-primary-color film. If you want to strictly divide a boundary, then a natural color film is only a part of a three-primary-color film. It uses natural scenery to shoot panchromatic films, and every flower and grass appears on the screen in its color and natural tones without the slightest difference. If you shoot a pure natural color film, and the lens is completely shot outdoors, then the director's work will be much easier because the set is not needed.

Trial Experience

After the three-primary-color film was invented, they first used Disney's Mickey Mouse film as a trial because Mickey Mouse films are all short films, and even if the trial fails, the loss will be relatively small. Who knew that the trial result would be a great success. From then on, the general film audience found the Mickey Mouse black and white films to be bland and tasteless, resulting in Mickey Mouse cartoons having to be in color. Recently, the production of the full-length Mickey Mouse panchromatic film "Snow White" is a major achievement in three-primary-color cartoons.

After Success

After the successful trial of three-primary-color films using Mickey Mouse, the various film companies in Hollywood began to pay attention to this type of color film. Any script story or theme that is suitable for shooting three-primary-color panchromatic films is shot in color. In our memory, the success of "Vanity Fair," "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine," "Ramona," and "Snow White" has been a great harvest in color.

Countries Compete to Shoot

Now, general film companies in various countries are also using new types of color films. But in fact, the cost of shooting a three-primary-color film is much higher than a black and white film. This is the limitation of material conditions. Therefore, although three-primary-color films have been invented for seven or eight years, we still rarely see one in the cinema. Unlike sound films, which were invented and soon every film had sound.

The Chinese Historical Painting Exhibition opened yesterday at the painting hall of the Great New Company. I was fortunate to attend and admired the famous paintings, and was amazed. This event is to raise medical relief funds. All my compatriots should do their duty. Moreover, such a grand ancient painting exhibition is an unprecedented event in Shanghai. Don't miss this great opportunity. Use a few words to recommend it to readers.

A Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Ming Dynasty Actually Judged a Wrongful Case from the Yuan Dynasty

As the saying goes, "If the play is not good enough, the immortals are superficial." Immortals are immortal, so they can be arbitrarily used in any dynasty (but there must be a limit to this). It is absolutely not because Bao Gong, Hai Rui, and Liu Yong are all upright officials and judge cases like gods that one of them can be arbitrarily invited to handle these wrongful cases. Moreover, the Yuan opera already had a record of "Bao'e's Wrongful Case," which is sufficient to prove that Shi E must have lived in the Yuan Dynasty, at least. The Yuan Dynasty is about three hundred years away from Hai Gangfeng, the Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Ming Dynasty during the Wanli period. May I ask how a person three hundred years later could run to the Yuan Dynasty or even earlier to judge Shi E's strange wrongdoings? This is simply a big joke. I find it very laughable that the famous actress who adapted this complete "Golden Lock Record" did not use her brain at all. Because if she invited Hai Gangfeng, it would be better to bring out Bao Longtu of the Song Dynasty, which would be easier to attract the audience's attention. The reason is that Hai Rui's fame is not as well-known as Bao Heizi, who also judges yin and yang. I remember that when ordinary old actors used to sing "June Snow," it was still Grand Tutor Dou (not the Heavenly Official) who tried the case. If you don't believe it, you can take out the old "Play Examination" and the "Play Learning Compilation Examination" published by the Great East Book Company to compare them, which can prove that my words are based on evidence. In the past, the Pi Huang opera troupe had Bao Tashi appear on stage, which shows that the opera is similar to the Jin Bangzi opera. Now, a famous actress insists on changing it randomly, and changes it very badly. Isn't this adding feet to the snake? Actresses who sing a certain school's "Golden Lock Record" in Shanghai, please study it carefully so that you won't be criticized for blindly following.

### Recording the "Charity Music Concert"

— Mu Zhong

After more than two months of preparation, the "Charity Music Concert" hosted by the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association finally performed at the Lyceum Theater on April 7.

In addition to the association's original vocal group, Cantonese music band, silk and bamboo band, and harmonica team, this music concert also invited many outside music groups and famous musicians. Because the purpose was charity and disaster relief, the participants were very enthusiastic and enthusiastic.

There were quite a few programs. In terms of instrumental music: there was Cantonese music, Chinese music, harmonica, accordion, violin, piano, pipa, and orchestral music, etc. The most special one was Ms. Lin Ming's performance of saw music. The instrument was saw-shaped, and when iron pieces were rubbed back and forth on the saw teeth, the tone was melodious, gentle, and pleasing to the ear. Coupled with the harmony of the gramophone records, it was even more moving. Saw music was certainly novel, and Ms. Lin's acting skills were calm and steady. No wonder she won a lot of applause from the audience.

The Youth Orchestra's performance of "March" and "Light Cavalry" was also very exciting, especially the latter, which was more popular. Mr. Zhu Shalom's conducting was skilled and full of spirit, which made it even more powerful. Mr. Zhang Zhenfu's piano and Mr. Yang Songping and Yang Songshun's violin duet were truly superb in their acting skills, but unfortunately, the music was too high-brow and too far from the public's level of understanding. The Mass Model Harmonica Team conducted by Shi Renwang is very well-known. This time, the accordion and harmonica were played in harmony and unison, and the audience thought it was very satisfactory. As for the participation of the association's own members: such as the Cantonese music ensemble led by Mr. Chen Yingri, the acting skills were very skilled, and the Chinese music's Manjiang Hong was of a different style. Mr. Chen Tianle's pipa solo—Ambush from Ten Sides—had skilled technique, but unfortunately the tune was too long, and one person's solo was too monotonous.

The vocal department includes: solo, three-part chorus, four-part chorus, and large chorus.

In the solo, Ms. Li Yingzhi's soprano and Mr. Ge Chaozhi's low and middle voice were both very good. The remaining three-part chorus, four-part chorus, and large chorus were all performances by the association's own vocal group members. There were two large choruses, one was the Barge Haulers' Song, and the other was the Hunting Song. The Hunting Song was the last finale song, composed by Huang Zi. Although the lyrics were very startling, the tune was not as great as the former. I think it would have been a little more prudent not to use the Barge Haulers' Song as the finale. In the two large choruses, there were forty or fifty men and women, directed by Mr. Zheng Shouyan. The tones were harmonious, which was commendable; especially the Barge Haulers' Song, accompanied by the organ and piano, was even more exciting, and it was truly unique.

The performance of this charity music concert was above the average level. There were a total of twenty-two programs, and the performance time took four hours, which can be considered full. Ticket sales, due to the enthusiasm of the members and the enthusiasm of the purchasers, although the seats were not full, there were very few empty seats left. I believe that this concert organized by the Silver and Money Industry Association has made a great effort to relieve the victims.

### As I Have Heard: Zhang Shoutang's Gathering

— Da Yu

The day and night show is arranged by oneself. A gathering of famous actors and movie stars.

The thirteenth was the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Yun Sheng, the father of Mr. Zhang Shankun, the owner of the Gongwu Stage and Xinhua Film Company. Mr. Zhang has a wide range of contacts and is known as the "Trust" of the film industry. Friends from all walks of life made great preparations in advance to launch a celebration, planning to book the entire New World rooftop garden for a big lively event. However, Mr. Shankun himself, because he is in this extraordinary period, does not want to overdo things, and insists on the three principles of not sending invitations, not being ostentatious, and not receiving gifts, and implements "celebration economization." He only set up a ceremony hall in the International Ballroom, and a banquet in the New World Restaurant to entertain relatives and friends. All the actors of the Gongwu Stage and the male and female stars of Xinhua, as well as famous actors such as Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baisui, and Wang Xichun, will perform Peking opera day and night to entertain the guests. The repertoire has been arranged yesterday. The day show will start at 12:00 noon, and all the actors of the Gongwu Stage will jointly perform "Eight Hundred and Eighty Years" and "Magu Celebrating Longevity," the complete "Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness," and Wang Xichun's "Thirteen Sisters," and Zhou Xinfang and Gao Baisui's "Stealing Zongjuan" (Jia Fang plays Chen Ping, Baisui plays Zhang Cang). The night show will start at 6:00 p.m. and will feature Wang Jiting and Tang Jie's "Asking for the Wretched Mansion," Wang Mengshi and Zhang Zhizhi's "Catching and Releasing Cao," Dai Yanwan's "The Drunken Concubine" (Dai is the famous actor Dai Nanfang, who graduated from the Nantong Opera School and is now also an actor of Xinhua Company), Gu Lanjun and Yin Xiucen's "Visiting Relatives and Scolding," Yue Feng and Bai Hong's "Joining the Army and Saying Goodbye," Cheng Xiaoting, Guan Xianling, Liu Jiqun, Han Langen, and Yin Xiucen's "Chasing Han Xin," Gu Meijun and Li Xiuying's "Fen River Bay," Wang Yuanlong's "White Horse Slope," Yuan Meiyun and Wang Xianzhai's "Hongluanxi," Zhang Wenjuan's "Dingjun Mountain," Tian Ganwen and Mao Jianqiu's "Four Lang Visiting His Mother," and Wang Shaolou's "Filial Son," etc. It is scheduled to perform until midnight. Because Wang Xichun, Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baisui, and other actors' plays were originally scheduled as the finale of the evening show, but the Carlton is currently performing the new play "Wen Suchen," and they could not be separated. It was also inconvenient to change to another play, so the plays of the three were arranged for the day show. At that time, there will definitely be a grand event between "International" and "New World." It is also heard that Xinhua Company will shoot the grand event of that day into a lens, and it will be screened in the Huguang, Jincheng, and Xinguang theaters the next day.

### The Dancer Will Perform "Tears of Flowers"

— Li Ren

—The Location is Still the Carlton

It has been rumored for a long time that the dancers are going to perform "Tears of Flowers," which is about their own problems. According to recent news, it will become a reality. The actors who have been determined to play the roles are: Yang Wenying as Mimi, Wei Chuyun as Dingxiang, and Qiao Qi as the young master Chen Darling—who played Dr. Mao Henry in "Putting on Airs." Tu Guangqi of the Shanghai Drama Society will still play Jin Shixi. As for the roles of Chang Haicai and Xiao Li, it is quite difficult to find suitable talents to play them. But it has now been agreed that Mr. Shu Yan and Gu Menghu will make guest appearances, so there is generally no problem.

The roles of Manli and Gu Xiaomei have not yet been determined. They are now trying to invite Zhang Xinzhu (i.e. Lily Zhang) and Yin Meifeng to take on the roles, but it has not yet been determined.

There is also some good news: when the Shanghai Drama Society performed "Tears of Flowers," the fifth act could not be performed due to environmental reasons. Although it still cannot be performed this time, the original author Mr. Yu Ling has revised the fourth act, which will of course make the whole play more compact.

The time is probably the 22nd of this month, and the location is still the Carlton.

This performance is to plead for the refugees. May all people in Shanghai support it!
