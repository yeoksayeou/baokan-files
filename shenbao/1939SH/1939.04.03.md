Chinese troops north of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have largely taken control of everything. The Japanese troops invading Nanchang are already in trouble. The Japanese troops that invaded Jing'an and Wuning are engaged in battles with the Chinese troops nearby. (Morning dispatch on the 3rd)

Xiushui: On the morning of the 2nd, approximately two regiments of Japanese troops, along with an artillery battalion, advanced on Gao'an along the Nanwan Highway. The Chinese troops bravely resisted northeast of Gao'an, about ten *li* away, and the battle was extremely fierce. Many Japanese armored vehicles were seen in the western hills of Wanshou Palace. Japanese troops north of Xiangtang are reportedly building fortifications. The Japanese troops occupying Wuning have made no progress. Overall, the current deployment of the Japanese troops suggests that their main focus is on the Nanwan Highway. (Dispatch on the 2nd)

Xiushui: Japanese troops from Xiangfuguan, northeast of Gao'an, about ten *li* away, briefly invaded the area and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops. At dawn on the 2nd, the Chinese troops launched a fierce counterattack, engaging in close combat with the Japanese troops throughout the day, killing three to four hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing many ponchos and gas masks.

(Chongqing) Newspapers here are discussing the future goals of the Japanese troops. Many believe that after capturing Nanchang, the Japanese troops will continue to advance towards Changsha, then turn south to coordinate with the Japanese troops advancing from northern Guangdong. Chinese military reports confirm a large westward advance, seemingly aimed at Gao'an, but the ultimate goal appears to be Changsha, as the Japanese troops are increasingly active in northern Hunan. The Chinese strategy to cope with this involves strengthening fortifications in key cities and towns, and implementing guerrilla warfare near Nanchang to prevent the Japanese troops from advancing rapidly. The *Dagongbao* newspaper emphasized in a commentary that the future strategy of the Chinese troops should focus on preventing the Japanese troops from advancing. (Dispatch from Huitong News Agency on the 2nd)

Xiushui: The city walls of Wuning are surrounded by mountains, forming a basin, and the Xiushui River winds around its southwest, further hindering any westward invasion. On the 31st, the 1st, and the 2nd, small groups of Japanese soldiers crossed the river to probe three kilometers southwest. The Chinese troops bravely counterattacked, and the Japanese soldiers, fearing annihilation due to their position with their backs to the river, fled back to the city walls. (Dispatch on the 2nd)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops advancing along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang are still engaged with the Chinese troops near Liangjiadu.

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi are currently advancing westward in two routes: one from Wuning towards Xiushui, and the other along the Hunan-Hubei Highway, attempting to converge on Changsha. It is reported that the first route of Japanese troops is being intercepted by Chinese troops at Fenkou Town, twenty-five kilometers northeast of Xiushui. The second route of Japanese troops is still engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops in the Shanghuxu and Huipu areas near Gao'an. The main force of the Chinese troops that withdrew from the Nanchang area has now reached a new position forty-five miles southwest of Nanchang. This new position was constructed after the loss of De'an last year. The trenches and fortifications are built in the mountains, stretching for dozens of kilometers, forming the only route for the Japanese troops to attack Changsha from Jiangxi Province.

Editorial

### Wang Jingwei Advocates Peace Again

Three or five days ago, a dispatch from Hong Kong reported that Jingwei had written an article advocating peace again. The dispatch was brief, making it unclear what he meant. When advancing, he becomes ecstatic, unaware of political affairs and lacking a sense of the bigger picture. When retreating, he complains and resorts to writing, oblivious to logic. Chinese scholars have always been like this, with these kinds of faces and habits. Is Jingwei not one of them? Recently, I happened to see a translation of his article. Its shallowness and immaturity are truly lamentable. When he betrayed the country and fled, making lofty pronouncements, some lamented that he had cut himself off from the people and his future. In reality, he is not without talent, but his past experiences have prevented him from seeking further progress, causing him to remain in a stage of immaturity and superficiality. It is unfortunate that he is stuck in the past, not that he has no future. The article is not worth addressing or refuting, but given the fallacies it contains, and the need to clarify the distinctions between peace and war, a journalist cannot remain silent. Let me explain them separately:

First, the end of a war must involve negotiations for peace. This is the simplest of principles. Therefore, in the midst of war, one should not fear that peace will never come, and indeed, the more one fights, the closer one gets to the day of peace. The issue is how to seize the best opportunity for peace negotiations. If the conditions are not met, there should be no negotiations. If the timing is not right, there should be no negotiations. Otherwise, regardless of the theory or the pretext, the objective result will be surrender. In early December of the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic, 1937], a little over a hundred days after the August 13th Incident, German Ambassador to China Oskar Trautmann conveyed to the Chinese authorities the Japanese side's conditions for ending the war. The conditions were not made public, but it is said that their content was milder than the statement made by Konoe [Fumimaro] on December 22nd of the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, 1938]. Konoe's statement included demands for inland residency and the stationing of troops, and it touched on the structure of the Chinese central government. It was as if he was a victorious power using peace as a smokescreen for the destruction of China. It is said that the German ambassador's message was not like this. Therefore, although outsiders cannot know how the Chinese authorities responded to the German ambassador, we cannot hastily believe what the traitor has reported. Given that the conditions varied at different times, we cannot say that the response to the German ambassador should have been the same as the response to Konoe's statement. Moreover, in the first three or four months of the war of resistance, the Chinese side was ill-equipped and faced a powerful enemy. Neither the front lines nor the rear were stable. After more than a year, by the end of last year, although the battle lines had shifted, the military had a stronger grasp on ultimate victory than in the initial stages. Conversely, the signs of defeat and weakness on the Japanese side were becoming increasingly apparent. Therefore, the timing at the end of last year cannot be said to be the same as the timing at the end of the previous year.

Second, war and peace are major national affairs, not child's play, and should not be undertaken lightly. Therefore, in the face of a crisis, when war is imminent, when it is possible to fight or concede, those in charge of national planning should gather ideas and consider things thoroughly. As for the citizens, whether in or out of government, they should all rack their brains and contribute to the nation. Thus, a decision is made to fight or not to fight. Once the war has broken out, the entire country must be of one mind and heart, facing the great calamity together. There is a nation, and there is no individual selfishness. There is national policy, and there is no preconceived notion. Everything puts the military first. Regardless of the citizens, they should automatically contribute their lives and assets to the nation, and their words and actions should conform to national policy. As for the nation, it has the full authority to control the lives, assets, words, and actions of its citizens. For any matter, thing, or object that hinders the war effort, there must be severe sanctions. The government has the power to execute, and the people have the inherent duty to protect the nation and its policies at all times and in all places. Now, clearly disregarding what is right and engaging in speech and actions that violate national policy, and then blaming others for "scolding and slandering," is tantamount to fundamentally denying the existence of the national organization and the arguments and values that underpin it.

Third, the so-called "if China and Japan fight, both will be hurt; if they make peace, both will prosper" is an empty philosophical cliché, and it is extremely immature and superficial to take it as the sole argument for advocating peace. In so-called fighting, one must first ask what they are fighting for. In so-called peace, one must first ask how peace can be achieved. China does not want war but has no choice but to resist because it is a matter of life and death. If it does not resist, it will die or perish, which is more than just being hurt. In other words, the war was initiated by the Japanese. They have not only failed to withdraw their troops and cease hostilities but have also continued to invade. I ask, does China have any other option besides resistance? In this situation where resistance is unavoidable, to oppose resistance and advocate peace is to ask, what else is there besides submission and surrender? One must know that this decision to wage war, not only was the war initiated by Japan, but also the key to whether the war continues or ends, up to this point, lies with Japan. Only if China resists until Japan changes its plans, withdraws its troops, and ceases hostilities will China have no need to continue its resistance. Or, if resistance continues until Japan's strength is depleted and it can no longer invade and has no choice but to withdraw its troops, China will then have room to discuss peace. The war will end in peace, but that is not what is being discussed in China today. As for the so-called hundred-year plan for East Asia, hundred-year stability, and coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan, the Japanese have said it often and for a long time, but the content of their stability and prosperity is the conquest of China, and the way they are implementing it is also the conquest of China. How can China abandon its only path to survival through resistance and respond to it?

### Japanese Plan to Permanently Station Heavy Troops in China; Establish Factories Locally to Manufacture Munitions; Plunder Raw Materials and Squeeze the Lifeblood of the People

(Tokyo) According to sources here, the Japanese military, in order to permanently station heavy troops in China and at the same time eliminate the need to transport munitions and supplies, plans to establish munitions industries and various other military supply factories in the areas where troops are stationed in China. At a recent session of the Japanese Diet, someone asked Army Minister Itagaki [Seishiro] about the troop stationing plan in China. Itagaki replied, "For the sake of sound national defense, the best approach is to develop important industries on the mainland that can produce munitions. In this way, our heavy troops can be stationed on the mainland for a long time to prevent any unforeseen changes." One of the Diet members then asked, "If our country were to obtain raw materials from Manchuria and China based on the economic grouping of the "Japan-Manchukuo-China" triangle, and then transport them back to Japan for processing and manufacturing, wouldn't that be more beneficial?" Army Minister Itagaki replied, "In my opinion, our entire plan should be based on the policy of local self-sufficiency." Furthermore, in the budget subcommittee of the Lower House, a Diet member inquired about the military's purchase of raw materials in China, revealing the following facts: (1) The Japanese military will purchase various local products in the occupied areas and will attempt to squeeze out third-country buyers. (2) The main products purchased by the Japanese are cotton, ramie, wool, and animal hides. (3) The military plans to allocate 60 million yen to purchase these products this summer. (4) The prices of the various raw materials purchased by the Japanese military in the occupied areas are entirely determined by the Japanese side, but in order to promote the recovery of local vitality, they do not plan to excessively suppress prices. (5) Various products that the Japanese military does not need in China will be transported back to Japan by transport ships to be manufactured into commodities for export.

### Extreme Shortage of Leather in Japan; Even Poisonous Snakes and Toads are Affected; Former Foreign Minister Ugaki Wears Sharkskin Shoes

(Dalian) There is an extreme shortage of leather in Japan, so snake skin and toad skin must also be collected for national use. The Japanese authorities are asking the public to donate snakes and toads in exchange for compensation. Even the people within Manchuria must participate in this campaign. The Japanese have recently discovered that sharkskin is an excellent substitute for cowhide. Former Foreign Minister Ugaki has been wearing shoes made of sharkskin for the past few months.

Japanese Warlords Openly Interfere in Politics; Draft Reform Plans and Force Hiranuma to Implement Them

(Tokyo) Japanese army leaders are now planning political actions so that the Hiranuma cabinet can adopt clear steps to implement certain domestic reform plans that the military deems necessary, such as the creation of an independent Ministry of Commerce, the fundamental reorganization of the Cabinet Planning Board, and the study of munitions and military supply prices. People in the army are even planning to form an investigation committee to investigate rear-area activities and advocate that the army should assume responsibility for various issues related to Japan's domestic situation and seek to resolve them. According to the opinion of army leaders, the army committee should investigate the following matters: (1) Whether there are shortcomings in the administration of providing for the families of soldiers at the front. (2) The reemployment and livelihood of disabled soldiers. (3) Whether there have been delays in the consolation money received by the families of soldiers injured in the war in China. (4) The convenience and conditions of army hospitals. The *Jiji Shimpo* newspaper stated that since the establishment of the Konoe cabinet, the army has not been very involved in civil affairs, but now the trend is changing, and it is exerting its efforts that were previously suppressed in order to realize the events it expects from the government. This move will have a real impact on the future position of the Hiranuma cabinet. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 2nd)

Japan's Coal Supply Falls Short of Demand

(Tokyo) The total amount of coal required by Japan's various booming industries this year is 60 million tons, an increase of 7 million tons over the previous year. The Japan Coal Miners Association is currently making every effort to increase production, but the procedures stipulated by the Goods Supply Control Law have not been implemented smoothly. The significant increase in Japan's coal demand is due to the good progress of the government's plan to expand manufacturing. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 1st)

Yuanqu: Japanese troops who previously infiltrated from Ershililing (south of Jiexian) to Monan, Bazhu, Jiayao, and Dagounan, attempted to coordinate with Qi Gang to invade Pinglu. Chinese troops divided their forces to resist. The Japanese troops failed to advance. On the 1st, Chinese troops began a counteroffensive against the Japanese troops in the above-mentioned areas. One route was divided, with troops launching a pincer attack from Xiaojiang, Nanyue Village, toward the Japanese troops in Dagounan. Fighting raged from morning until 3:00 PM. The artillery fire was exceptionally fierce. The Japanese troops were wounded and suffered more than 400 casualties. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the assault, retreated to Daoshu and Guannan villages. Chinese troops immediately recaptured Dagounan and continued to pursue the fleeing Japanese troops.

Xingji: Japanese troops in Shanxi have repeatedly been attacked by Chinese troops and cannot bear the hardship. They have adopted a strategy of offense as defense, conducting guerrilla warfare everywhere. Therefore, in recent weeks, there has been fierce fighting in western Shanxi, northern Shanxi, and eastern Shanxi. Currently, the situation in northwestern Shanxi is gradually quieting down. East of Tongpu, after Chinese troops recaptured Fushan and Anze, most of the Japanese troops were transferred to the railway line. Except for a portion of Chinese troops now approaching Koucheng and holding out against the Japanese troops, other areas east of the railway are also trending toward quiet. The current battle situation seems to have shifted to southern Shanxi again. Japanese troops have been reinforcing southward from the Linfen Houma area for several days. Thousands of Japanese troops are concentrated in Zhangdian Town south of Xiaxian, conducting guerrilla warfare toward the Xianghe coast. Therefore, the situation in the Pinglu Maojin area is relatively tense. Chinese troops are dividing their forces to block them. This decision by the Japanese troops to turn to southern Shanxi is also a strategy of offense as defense. (2nd day telegram)

Xingji: There are no major changes in the Lishi, Zhongyang area of western Shanxi. However, Japanese troops in Dawu Town north of Lishi are still plotting a northward attack.

They were ambushed by Chinese troops along the way and suffered heavy losses. (1st day telegram)

Xingji: More than 700 Japanese troops stationed in Taiyuan, with two cannons, attacked the Chinese Zhangjiazhuang position via Guanjia Yu yesterday.

### Lanzhou Aircraft Flies Back to Chongqing from Hami; China-Soviet Air Route Test Completed; Overall Weather Conditions Very Good

(Chongqing) The China-Soviet air route "Lanzhou" aircraft, which previously flew to Hami for a test flight, has now flown back to Chongqing. According to the aircraft's Chinese engineer, Lin Qingtai (transliteration), to a Reuters reporter today, the overall weather conditions were very good. The high mountains that must be passed are Qipan Mountain between Xi'an and Lanzhou, Wuxiaoling between Lanzhou and Liangzhou (transliteration), and Daxueshan between Liangzhou and Suzhou. Because each mountain is more than 1,200 feet high, the aircraft had to fly at an altitude of more than 13,000 feet. The Soviet section of the air route between Almaty and Hami has not yet started flying due to snow accumulation at the Urumqi airport. However, it is reported that Soviet Ambassador to China Orelski, who took a car from Chongqing on March 26 to return to Moscow, has already taken the full route through Urumqi. The Soviet section of this air route will establish stations in Almaty, Taichen, Urumqi, and Hami. (2nd day Reuters)

滇緬公路

(Singapore) Paris Daily representative Wilmoring and French satirical artist Jean Cersault, who drove 14,000 miles from Paris to Saigon, recently passed through Singapore and told a Reuters reporter about the Yunnan-Burma New Highway, saying that the road can currently accommodate 50 cargo trucks per day. The bridges may not be able to bear the weight of trucks over 3.5 tons. Due to time constraints, the road construction is not yet solid, so it is feared that during the rainy season, mountain water will rush down, making the road difficult to pass. The new road built by the British in Myanmar is quite good, allowing vehicles to drive at any speed. (2nd day Reuters)

### Kong Xiangxi Reviews Current Financial Situation

(Chongqing) According to official sources, Kong Xiangxi recently reviewed the current financial situation in China at an official training class, stating that since the outbreak of the war, the government has taken two steps to maintain its financial strength: first, to increase taxes; and second, to increase domestic and foreign bonds. The readjustment of tax rates is based on the principle of encouraging imports of essential goods and imposing heavy taxes on luxury goods, with some as high as 80%. Since the Japanese occupied the customs, the Chinese government has established a stronger transportation tax system to compensate for the losses. To date, the government has issued 160,000,000 yuan in domestic debt since the start of the war. (2nd day Associated Press)

### Aggressive Ambitions Difficult to Curb; Hitler Still Extols Peace; Countries Adopt Encirclement Policy, German Power Intolerable; Claims Abandoning Maritime Agreements and Blames England in Image

William Haigang: The German 35,000-ton battleship "Tirpitz" held its launching ceremony here yesterday afternoon. Führer Hitler personally presided over it and delivered a speech, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Germany signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement with the sincere desire for peace. (2) If England does not have this desire, then this premise fails. (3) Germany does not want to attack other countries but only wants to develop its economic interests. (4) Germany will continue its armament when pressed by other countries. Hitler's speech was not surprising. Although he satirized England, he did not scold it. (2nd day Reuters)

Starting with Old Accounts from Before the War

William Haigang: Hitler delivered a long-awaited speech yesterday before 100,000 listeners. Hitler first described the unfair treatment Germany had suffered in the past. In 1919, the countries that were enemies of Germany seized its territory and exploited its rights. Germany, in a state of being attacked on all sides, could not but take action. However, the 1939 National Socialist Party Congress can be called the Peace Congress (listeners cheered). Germany's aspiration is to make peace its goal. Hitler also said that when William Haigang was first opened as a port and gradually prospered, Germany competed with other countries using peaceful methods, but other countries responded with suspicion, eventually leading to war, which is truly regrettable. At that time, England adopted a policy of encircling Germany. England had stated that after defeating Germany, all countries could benefit. At that time, Germany unfortunately adopted a policy of watching from the sidelines, not engaging in self-defense, eventually leading to the outbreak of war. Everything was unfavorable, which is truly regrettable. However, everyone knows that Germany fought bravely, regardless of personal safety. Unfortunately, it was defeated, not due to the fault of war. Hunger ravaged its physical strength, and the enemy's cunning propaganda further blinded its vision. When Wilson's Fourteen Points were announced, Germany's leaders thought peace could be expected and waited. Hitler, speaking to this point, listed several examples to prove that the outcome of the facts was completely opposite to Wilson's stated intentions, saying that Germany mistakenly believed Wilson's words and rested, never expecting that other countries would repeatedly bully and oppress Germany with plagiarism, even depriving it of its right to survival. At that time, Germany compromised on everything, accommodating itself, and the result was this. I was shocked and determined to save the country, to eliminate domestic enemies, unite the strength of the whole country, and destroy the evil forces of Versailles. As a step-by-step plan, when other countries' politicians advertised maintaining world justice, our reply was—the so-called justice of 1919 is not true justice but the arbitrary tyranny of a few countries. The German nation stands between heaven and earth and should make protecting its fundamental interests its duty and not live to protect the so-called justice of England or the justice of France. This meaning is very clear and needs no further explanation.

New Germany Is No Longer What It Used to Be

Hitler then spoke in a heroic manner, saying that now Germany is united and strong, no need to cater to the wishes of other countries' politicians, no need to worry about the joy and anger of other countries. Thus, he made a brief description of Germany's progress since 1933, and then quoted a proverb to boast, "God helps those who help themselves." We have worked diligently, constantly striving to improve ourselves. In a few years, Germany has indeed emerged from the valley and reached the realm of light. If English politicians now believe that Germany should resolve all issues with other countries through negotiations, then why did the countries not implement this proposal 15 years ago and make fair solutions? Germany also deeply hoped to achieve good results through the Geneva organization. What is regrettable is that it failed to achieve its wish. Since then, Germany has actively promoted domestic and foreign affairs, working hard to build the country. Who knew that the world would regard the national revival of Germany and Italy as a crime? Only countries that do not occupy vast territories can be said to be good deeds?

Mocking England's Lack of Virtue Is Thorough

In reality, what virtues has England had in the past three hundred years? Now it uses virtue as a sermon, which is strange. Even judging from England's actions in the past twenty years, it clearly shows that it does not understand the true meaning of virtue. This can be seen from England's treatment of Germany after the war. I really do not know if there is such a thing as virtue in the world. Ever since I took office, I had proposed to resolve important issues through negotiations, but all were rejected. If England requires discussion of Germany's internal affairs, then I will also make the same request. I believe its response will be "Palestine has nothing to do with you." So the interests that are vital to Germany are also unrelated to England. The principle is the same. The German people cannot abandon the vital interests in this survival competition. Countries ignored justice when Germany was weak, changing the map of Europe. Now the situation has changed, and Germany will not tolerate it. Germany has no hatred for the Czech people. This is something English politicians cannot understand. In fact, St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague was not built by the English or French but by Germans.

Annexing Czechoslovakia Is a Strategic Need

From this perspective, Czech territory has been within our sphere of interest for the past thousand years. Germany's move is also to prevent future crises. Therefore, it can no longer be tolerated. Regarding this point, I can use the words of the former French Air Force Minister as proof, because he said that Czechoslovakia is a base for attacking Germany. This is a major issue that concerns our interests. Looking around the situation, there is no possibility of a peaceful resolution. I had no choice but to annex it based on common geography and history. The Czech people will then enjoy freedoms they have never had before. Germany is now doing its utmost to turn the tools of war against Germany into the foundation of Germany's security. Therefore, I will name this year's National Socialist Party Congress the "National Socialist Party Peace Congress," because Germany really has no intention of attacking other countries.

Developing the Economy Is the Only Desire

Germany's only desire now is to expand its foreign economic relations. Germany's production and consumption are also part of the European economic system. Germany should conduct trade with all countries with an honorable attitude and on the premise of peace. The encirclement policy is intolerable.

Involving the Anglo-German Naval Agreement

As for the naval agreement established between Germany and England, it is also one of Germany's efforts for peace. If England continues this aspiration, then the naval agreement should continue to be effective. But if other countries continue to expand their armaments, Germany is also unwilling to fall behind in order to protect the security of the country. If a certain country wants to measure Germany's military strength, the German people will not hesitate to deal with it. Germany's allies will also express their sympathy for this.

The German-Italian Axis Has Not Weakened

Foreign newspapers often claim that the relationship between the German-Italian axis countries has weakened and even discuss breaking up. This is one of the acts of political sabotage, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. On the contrary, the relationship between the axis countries is more solid than the agreements between any other countries. If the Soviet Union and England are willing to cooperate without making the international situation more tense, then I am also willing to congratulate them. In any case, the ideological link between Germany and Italy is more natural and harmonious than the combination and integration of British capitalism and democracy with Stalin's Bolshevik thought. The discerning person can draw his own conclusions.

Celebrating the Victory of the Spanish National Army

Hitler continued, "In recent days, we have experienced a great victory. A country has been liberated from the ravages of Bolshevism and has gained freedom. We should gladly congratulate Spain on its victory. German youth helped friendly countries obtain national self-determination, while others once supplied the Red Army with arms and now want to trade with the National Army for profit. How can the scale of people's minds be compared?"

Not Sparing Sacrifices to Defend Territory

In short, we have been internally united, and economic life is thriving. No less than millions of Germans have returned to German soil. We are willing to give Central Europe peace and should contribute to defending it. Before the European war, no less than two million Germans sacrificed themselves for the country. Now that Greater Germany has been completed, the sacrifices of the martyrs laid its foundation, and we can achieve its cause. In the future, we should not spare any sacrifices to maintain it, so that the martyrs' benevolence will not be in vain. This heart is sincere, and I hope the world will recognize it. Comrades, those who wish to sign agreements and issue declarations in other countries, listen. I do not believe in words on paper. I believe in all of you. (2nd day Haitong News Agency)

Warning Poland Not to Take Risks

In his speech, Hitler also issued a warning to Poland, saying that those who are prepared to take risks for the benefit of a major country should also be prepared to eat the consequences. In any case, we will not tolerate it if other countries impose a policy of intimidation or a policy of encirclement on our country. Our country has now decided to protect its rights that are vital to its survival, which cannot be obstructed by any group. (Havas News Agency)

### Speech Broadcast Once Interrupted

(Berlin) The speech delivered by Führer Hitler at Wilhelmshaven today has been secretly preserved by the authorities through extraordinary measures. When the head of state spoke, the first section was broadcast by radio, but it was immediately suspended. At the same time, the authorities notified journalists from various countries that they were not allowed to leave their seats before the end of the speech. The reporters originally thought that the head of state had made shocking remarks, but after listening to the entire speech, they did not find anything particularly exciting. Observers from various countries who had once felt uneasy were greatly relieved. As for why the broadcast was suddenly interrupted, it is still a mystery. Some people believe that the authorities originally did not want to broadcast the head of state's speech. Various radio stations directly broadcast it, which was due to a misunderstanding, so it was temporarily stopped. Later, at 7:00 PM, the authorities handed over the recorded phonograph record of the head of state's speech to various radio stations across the country for broadcast. (1st day Havas News Agency)

### Aiming to Defend Against Aggression; England's Current Policy Remains Unwavering; Anti-Aggression Group Indirectly Includes United States and Soviet Union; If Germany Has Sincere Intention to Disarm, England Is Willing to Reopen Negotiations

British political figures responded to the speech delivered by German Führer Hitler today with a very calm attitude, saying that Hitler's intention is to stabilize German public opinion. Although he focused on criticizing England, England's current policy should still aim to defend against aggression and will not waver because of it. However, if Germany is willing to reduce its armaments and abandon its intimidating tactics, then England is also prepared to reopen negotiations with it to discuss disarmament. As for the anti-aggression group currently being planned by various countries, it will indirectly include the United States and the Soviet Union. In other words, when war breaks out in the future, the United States and the Soviet Union do not have to join the democratic front to fight together, but they will supply unlimited arms and raw materials to the democratic countries, so that they will maintain an absolute advantage in armaments.

Berlin Newspapers Comment One After Another

(Berlin) The speech delivered by Führer Hitler yesterday has recently been commented on by various newspapers, which all said that this is Germany's response to England's policy of encircling the country. The German Summary Report used the headline "How the Space for Germany's Survival Is Relevant Has Nothing to Do with England." The Anglo-German Naval Agreement has now become a problem. The Public Observation Report stated that "The head of state has replied and settled old accounts. Germany's strength cannot be defeated by any country in the world. The head of state has also announced to England that whether the Anglo-German Naval Agreement can continue to exist should be determined by whether the prerequisites for the establishment of this agreement can be maintained." The Local Guidance Report stated, "The head of state's speech yesterday still leaves England a period of consideration. We should wait quietly for a reply. If the country's anti-German attitude is not changed, we should know what to do." The Hamburg Foreign Affairs Report stated, "Germany has politically maintained great authority. The scope of its new policies should be determined by itself and cannot be interfered with by others." (2nd day Havas News Agency)

London Believes It Is Intentional Humiliation

(London) Today, British officials believe that Hitler's speech actually contains the meaning of accepting England's challenge, which will continue its ambition to expand its territory in Europe. Every point in Hitler's speech is intended to humiliate England. (2nd day Associated Press)

Italian Newspaper Defends Germany and Attacks England

Milan: Italian newspapers expressed a very friendly impression of Hitler's speech, while the Fascist System Report satirized England and criticized it severely, saying that England is willing to guarantee Poland's independence. Reflecting on the past, we cannot help but worry for Poland. Why? Haven't you seen Abyssinia, Czechoslovakia, and the Spanish Republican Government? After England and France came forward to guarantee them, the gods of misfortune followed one after another. The world has those who encourage other countries to fight bravely but themselves never help others to fight. Poland should be wary of this. (2nd day Haitong News Agency)

Sweet Words, Poisoned Heart; Poland Anesthetized

Warsaw: There is great interest here in Hitler's speech. Although there were many critical remarks about England in the speech, the listener naturally paid attention with joy because he repeatedly declared that Germany has the aspiration to maintain peace. Furthermore, Hitler also named the 1939 National Socialist Party Congress the National Socialist Party Peace Congress. In contrast, it can be seen that Hitler also uses peace as a slogan. (2nd day Haitong News Agency)

Warsaw: Political figures here have shown great attention to Hitler's speech, but because there is nothing directly involving Poland in the speech, they are unwilling to comment on it. However, because Hitler solemnly declared his aspiration to support peace, they have a generally good impression of his speech. (2nd day Haitong News Agency)

### Newspaper Opinions from France and the United States: A Glimpse. Paris: Extreme Doubt Expressed Regarding the Ability to Reassure the People

(Paris) After German leader Hitler's speech yesterday, although the French newspapers were quite comforted, they still expressed great doubts. The right-wing "Paris Echo" reported, "Since the Munich Conference, Leader Hitler has spoken extravagantly of peace, never so resolutely as now. Whether this speech can reassure the people is unknown, but it is a sign nonetheless. However, his intentions toward Poland are not without threat, and we should be seriously vigilant." "Le Petit Parisien" reported that Hitler stated that if countries wish to impose policies of intimidation or encirclement on Germany, he will never tolerate it; this is a threat to those countries willing to aid Poland. "Le Temps" reported that Hitler claimed that the National Socialist Party Congress scheduled for September would be called the "Peace Congress," intending to anesthetize us so that he can take action again in a short period. "Fortunately, the matter of collective security organization is progressing smoothly. If peace-loving countries wish to save themselves, there is no other way." "L'Ordre" reported, "As of today, Germany almost certainly understands that any act of violence is sufficient to immediately provoke war and place the country in an unfavorable position. For the sake of the country, there are only two paths to follow: one is to provoke war before Britain and France complete their rearmament plans; the other is to delay, to work calmly, hoping for a comeback. Judging from Hitler's speech, Germany has probably taken the second path." (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

United States: Words Quite Ambiguous, Situation Does Not Permit Optimism

(New York) American newspapers recently commented on Hitler's speech, generally saying that after Britain issued a warning, Germany's attitude has become hesitant. The "New York Evening Post" reported, "Leader Hitler has been ambiguous on certain points, and the tone of the Italian side is also quite mild, which shows that the stance adopted by various democratic countries is strong and effective." The "New York Times" reported that Leader Hitler did not address Po-

### United States Officially Recognizes the Spanish Nationalist Government: Lifting of Arms Embargo to Spain; First Ambassadorial Candidate Undecided; Pope Sends Telegram Congratulating Franco's Victory

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull this morning telegraphed the Spanish Nationalist government, informing them that the United States is prepared to establish diplomatic relations with the Nationalist government. He then issued a statement to the newspapers, briefly saying that after studying the various facts in Spain, the government decided to recognize the Nationalist government. The first ambassadorial candidate has not yet been decided. Political figures recently commented, saying that as of yesterday morning, Secretary of State Hull had no intention of recognizing the Nationalist government; it was not until after a long-distance telephone conversation with President Roosevelt last night that the decision was made. Moreover, this decision was announced before the Nationalist government's reply telegram arrived, which is contrary to custom. President Roosevelt recently issued a public announcement from Warm Springs, which stated: "A resolution passed by Congress on January 8, 1937, declared that a civil war had broken out in Spain. Now that the civil war in that country has ended, the circumstances under which the order issued on May 1, 1937, prohibiting the shipment of arms to that country, no longer exist. This order is hereby revoked." (Havas dispatch, 1st)

After receiving a congratulatory telegram from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Franco replied to express his thanks, briefly saying, "The blood shed by your country's soldiers in our country has established an indestructible bond between the two nations." In addition, the Nationalist wireless station in Salamanca broadcast the final battle report at 11:15 PM tonight. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

Bratislava: The border dispute between Slovakia and Hungary has been declared resolved because Slovakia agreed to cede territory without any exchange conditions.

Political figures here are adjusted, saying that Germany signed a protection agreement with this country, guaranteeing territorial integrity for a period of 25 years. Who knew that the ink would barely be dry before it forced this country to cede territory to Hungary? How can the effectiveness of the protection agreement not be doubted? (Havas dispatch, 1st)

If Britain is Threatened by War, Canada Will Help

Ottawa: Canadian Federal Justice Minister Lapointe delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, declaring that if the British Empire is threatened by war, Canada will inevitably rise up to participate in the war. The parliamentary side has paid great attention, saying that although Canadians oppose conscription, they do not refuse to help Britain. Those familiar with the matter say that if the Canadian Federation does not act in concert with the British Empire, it will be isolated, which is well known to Canadians. Therefore, if war breaks out in Europe in the future, it will help Britain with all its resources and send volunteer troops and technical personnel. As for the extent of the assistance, it will be announced when the war breaks out. As far as the current situation is concerned, Quebec is strongly opposed to conscription, so the federal government authorities have to be extremely cautious. (Havas dispatch, 1st)

### The United States Plans to Develop Civil Aviation in South America to Compete with the Totalitarian Countries

### Communist Party Case in Anti-Communist Country: Nineteen Defendants to Be Sentenced Separately

(Tokyo) Nineteen members of the Communist Party who were arrested in 1935 admitted to killing one of their comrades in the suburbs of Kobe, abandoning the body in the forest, and planning to rob a certain agricultural and industrial bank in Tokyo and the post offices of Tokyo and Kobe to fund the reorganization of the Japanese Communist Party. When the case was opened, defendant Mikami, who had been the chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the disbanded Japanese Communist Party, admitted to being the principal instigator and asked that the other eighteen defendants be leniently punished. The prosecutor has asked the court to sentence Mikami to death, with the remainder receiving prison sentences ranging from two to twelve years. It is heard that the case will be pronounced this month or next month (Reuters dispatch, 2nd). what kind of ultimatum was proposed by Poland. This layer can be noted. "However, the dangers of the situation in Eastern Europe are still many, and disturbances are still worthy of concern. If the world says that the crisis has passed, it is too early to say, and it is also a real situation that the time of disaster will not break out for a while." (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

Intimidation of Poland; Full Force Against Britain

(Washington) The speech delivered yesterday by German leader Hitler was recently commented on by American political figures, who generally believed this to be a provocation to Britain and that Hitler seemed to have abandoned the method of peaceful negotiations and was deeply superstitious about the methods used to destroy the Treaty of Versailles, annex Austria and Czechoslovakia, recover the Memel region, and complete other undertakings. As for his saying that "those who are prepared to take risks for the interests of the major powers should also be prepared to eat the consequences," it is actually an intimidation of Poland, attempting to prevent it from joining the anti-German group led by Britain and France.

He then went ashore and delivered a speech to a crowd of 80,000 people in front of the city hall (for the words, see the previous telegram). After the event, he boarded the "Robert Ley," a newly built cruise ship of the "Labor Front's Strength Through Joy" group, and traveled to Heligoland Island in the North Sea.

### Polish Foreign Minister Departs for Britain for a Visit; Accompanied by the Director of the Western European Department, etc.; The Goal is to Negotiate a Mutual Guarantee Treaty; The British Declaration of Support for Poland May Not Apply to Danzig

Warsaw: Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, along with the Director of the Western European Department Potocki and two secretaries, took the train to London for a visit at 1:23 PM today. British Ambassador Sir Kennard and many Polish dignitaries were at the station to see him off. Foreign Minister Beck is expected to pass through Berlin in the evening and arrive at Ostend, Belgium, tomorrow morning to transfer to a ship, arriving in London at 4:20 PM in the afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

(London) Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, is about to arrive in London to hold talks with the British authorities. The Sunday Times recently commented on it, saying that the goal of these talks is to conclude a "Mutual Guarantee Treaty" between Britain and Poland, and Britain intends to lend Poland £20 million as a huge sum to expand its military. At the same time, the two issues of Jewish emigration from Poland and the Free City of Danzig will also be raised for discussion. In short, the goal is for all countries that have decided to resist German aggression to unite with each other, in other words, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Turkey and Greece to unite with each other and form a unified front as a plan for self-preservation, in which Turkey is very important, because if a war breaks out in the future, the British fleet's activities in the eastern Mediterranean will depend on the ports of Turkey. The Observer reported that "No matter what excuse Germany makes, if it attempts to interfere with or change the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Poland, the Polish government will resist with force. However, the situation in the Free City of Danzig is different, and it cannot be regarded as Polish territory. On the contrary, the Polish Corridor is an integral part of the country's entire territory. In this sense, if Germany wants to incorporate the city of Danzig into East Prussia, it cannot be regarded as an act of aggression, but if Germany wants to connect East Prussia with the western provinces of the country, thereby infringing on the Polish Corridor, then Britain and France will fulfill the guarantee they have provided and intervene. However, the key to their actions will still depend on whether Poland resists Germany. At that time, if Poland repeats the mistakes of Austria and Czechoslovakia and enters Germany's urn, then Britain and France will of course not want to stand up and only stand by and watch."

German-Polish Dispute: Britain Asks Italy to Mediate, Hoping Germany Will Change Its Attitude

(Rome) Well-informed sources recently claimed that British Charge d'Affaires Sir Charles, when talking with Foreign Minister Ciano about the dispute between Poland and Germany, said that Italy has good relations with both countries and intends to ask them to mediate. Once relations between Germany and Poland ease, Britain will extend the guarantees it currently provides to Poland to other countries in Central and Southeastern Europe. The Italian government did not reject this suggestion, but said that the actions of the United Kingdom should not be aimed at encircling Germany, otherwise Italy would firmly oppose it. Political figures here also said that whether the current contacts between Britain and Italy can achieve something will depend on Germany's attitude and the demands it makes of Poland. However, Italy does not intend to initiate a Central and Southeast European security system, and unless the various demands made by France are met one day, Europe will not be able to ensure peace for a day.

Polish People's Anti-German Movement: Germany Makes False Propaganda

(Berlin) The National News Agency received news from the Katowice province of Poland, claiming that two German consulate personnel there were beaten by Poles and seriously injured. It also said that the owner of a German printing bureau in Karvin, a German national, was also beaten by Poles for speaking German and was receiving medical treatment. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Warsaw: Responsible persons here recently refuted the news issued the other day by the Deutsche Nachrichtenbüro, a semi-official German agency, that employees of the German consulate in Shenyang were beaten by Poles, saying that they knew nothing about it. However, the vigorous propaganda campaign carried out by the Germanic peoples in Poland, claiming that they have been subjected to abuse, or have been exploited by the German side, is quite worrying. Those in political circles say that the German tribal media are collecting various dispute information and issuing a list every week. The so-called disputes are probably Poles and Germanic peoples fighting each other, or Germans being punished for disturbing public order, and Polish officials prohibiting National Socialist Party meetings, and so on. These trivial matters, which no one paid attention to in the past, are now being exaggerated by the German side. Peering into their intentions, they probably want to use this to oppress Poland, just like the previous oppression of other countries. German Ambassador Moltke visited Foreign Minister Beck on March 29 to protest the anti-German movement in Bydgoszcz (March 26 incident). Although this issue did not have any developments afterwards, Poland's determination to resist Germany can be seen in the arrest of Von Funk, a reporter for the German News Agency stationed in Bydgoszcz (a German national but a Polish citizen), for sending false news.

Loubet Memorial Unveiling Ceremony: French President Delivers Speech

Montélimar, France: President Lebrun presided over the unveiling ceremony of the memorial to the late President Loubet here this morning. Although it was raining heavily, the majority of the people still enthusiastically participated. President Lebrun immediately delivered a speech, praising President Loubet's political achievements during his lifetime. He said that this man achieved many achievements at home and abroad during his tenure. In terms of domestic affairs, the unity of the whole nation has been achieved. In terms of foreign affairs, he finally enabled France to achieve relations with the nations and allied countries. He recalled that when he visited Russia in 1902, the Franco-Russian alliance treaty was completed because of this, and then visited Britain in 1903, and the Entente Cordiale was also established. Later, in 1904, he visited Italy, and France and Italy increased their friendship as a result. As for President Lebrun's participation in the general election, he did not say a word about it.

Siamese Military Reorganization is Purely for Self-Defense, Willing to Abide by Treaty Obligations, Maintain Friendship with Friendly Nations

Bangkok: Siamese Foreign Minister said here recently that the Siamese military reorganization program is purely for national defense purposes. If war breaks out in Europe, Siam is unwilling to take aggressive action against any neighboring country. British and French inspection teams recently came to Siam and expressed their goodwill. They must have realized that Siam is a peaceful country. Since the world is reorganizing its troops, Siam has no choice but to follow suit. However, Siam is doing this for no other reason than self-defense, and has no intention of aggression. Siam has concluded new treaties with thirteen countries, and Siam strictly abides by treaty obligations, so it has won the name of law-abiding country. Siam has never concluded a secret treaty with any foreign country. Siam is sparsely populated. It hopes that other countries will respect the natural desire of the Siamese people to pass on their country to their descendants and give them due respect. Siam is prepared to abide by international agreements and is willing to express its due fairness and goodwill to all friendly nations. The crowd believed that the foreign minister's remarks were in response to rumors that if war broke out in Europe, Siam would try to take advantage of the opportunity. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

Belgian Parliamentary Re-election Completed: Ancient Hatreds Between the Two Tribes Released: Foreign Troubles Promote Unity

Brussels: The re-election of the Senate and House of Representatives was held this morning. 202 members of the House of Representatives and 101 members of the Senate were elected. It has been completed by 1:00 PM. The process was very calm. The election results will be announced tomorrow night. Since Dr. Martens (who was sentenced to death for treason during the European War, then fled to the Netherlands, and then returned to Belgium under amnesty) was appointed as a researcher at the Royal Flemish Academy of Medicine, it was generally believed that the Flemish and Walloon tribes would have fierce competition during the election. Because of the events in Central Europe, the tribes abandoned their hatreds and spoke well of each other. Even the far-right Flemish National Party advocated tribal unity and issued a declaration today, briefly saying, "We do not want to be oppressed by the Walloons, and we do not want to be oppressed by Germany." If German leader Hitler attacks Belgium, we will stand on the first line of defense and resist. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

Brussels: Official circles recently announced that Dr. Martens has resigned from his position as a researcher at the Royal Flemish Academy of Medicine, and the dispute between the Flemish and Walloon tribes can be resolved as a result. According to reports, Dr. Martens was sentenced to death for treason during the European War and then fled to the Netherlands without being executed. Then, during the tenure of former Prime Minister Zeller, he was allowed to return to Belgium under amnesty for political prisoners. It was not until February of this year that former Prime Minister Spaak appointed him as a researcher at the Royal Academy of Medicine. At that time, Walloon people, including the Liberal Party and war veterans, rose up in opposition. Spaak was even beaten and injured, causing a political storm, and the Spaak cabinet had to resign. Later, the de Broqueville cabinet still failed to resolve the matter and dissolved the parliament last month, until now. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

British and Swedish Negotiation of a Commercial Agreement: Based on Free Trade

Stockholm, Sweden: British Secretary for Overseas Trade Hudson recently arrived here from the Swedish capital of Finland and will work with the Swedish government authorities to negotiate a commercial agreement based on free trade and without barter methods, just like the ones he negotiated in Poland, the Soviet Union, and Finland. This trip has no political connection and will return to London by plane on the 4th of this month to complete commercial negotiations while taking advantage of the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to the United Kingdom. He recently told reporters that he had visited Poland, the Soviet Union, and Finland and that the process was extremely satisfactory. The Soviet Union and Finland will send commercial delegations to London in a short period of time to formally conduct commercial negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 1st)

### North China Issues "Federal Reserve" Currency, Japanese Attempts All Fail, Allowing Exchange Will Weaken the Yen Further, Restricting Exchange Will Halt Commerce

Zi Lin Bao, Tianjin, March 24th: The "provisional government" of North China's financial order stipulating that each yuan of the Federal Reserve Bank currency is equal to one shilling and two pence has proven to be almost absurd due to the recent declaration by the Japanese Finance Minister to the Diet's budget committee that the yen will inevitably have to inflate. Currently, the financial situation in North China is chaotic.

The import and export trade is adversely affected as a result. This proves the truth of the saying "each acts on their own." The adoption of the new currency in North China was originally initiated by the Japanese military without regard to the strong advice of Japanese financiers. But if Japanese bankers try to influence the military strategy of the Japanese army in China, what kind of uproar will these soldiers make? At first glance, the adoption of a completely new currency in North China seems like a good financial strategy that can achieve four different goals in one fell swoop: (1) to crush the Chinese legal currency and inflict a fatal blow on the Chiang Kai-shek government politically and financially; (2) to issue worthless paper money to help pay for military expenses, and the Chinese people must exchange goods for this paper money; (3) to use this as a starting point to bring China into the yen bloc; (4) to enable the Japanese army to obtain the foreign exchange it urgently needs through the export of North China's products. Even those with less financial knowledge will immediately see that several of these goals are mutually contradictory. The

most serious

problem is that the soldiers who support this plan obviously did not consider the various resistances they would inevitably encounter. They probably thought they could force the oppressed people to accept the new currency, but later they seemed to be mixing war and finance into one, and believed that they could use bayonets to give this new currency real value. What is said above is at least the only explanation for their implementation of this policy. If the Federal Reserve Bank has been supported by the Chinese public, and has thus tried to establish a strong reserve, the new currency may have achieved satisfactory results. However, this has not been realized. The only support the new bank has received is the vague guarantee from a Japanese banking group to supply a small amount of funds. Therefore, the Federal Reserve Bank is actually just a

front organization.

What happened was that Japan poured yen notes into North China, but this yen note was given a different name for disguise. This can be proven by the fact that Japanese banks had to refuse to freely exchange large amounts of Federal Reserve currency for yen when this was first implemented. Free exchange would inevitably weaken the yen in Japan. However, if you want to establish a yen bloc, free exchange between these two currencies is necessary. In short, one of their four goals has failed so far. There has been a lot of noise from the Japanese military regarding the refusal of North China's foreign exchange banks to sell foreign exchange in Federal Reserve currency, accusing it of being a prank. They even claimed that

these currencies

have not yet obtained the correct value that they believe they deserve because they cannot buy foreign exchange. If the Japanese side stipulates that the new currency has the same value as the Chinese legal currency, then the Japanese army's complaints may have some basis. However, the official price of the yen is one shilling and two pence, so of course it cannot be less than this. If the Japanese side does this, then the new currency has been linked to the legal currency, not to the yen. Therefore, one yuan of the Federal Reserve Bank's currency is set at a price of one shilling and two pence, but North China's exporters who buy goods with currency worth eight pence obviously have no hope of competing with the world market if they are forced to buy goods with currency worth one shilling and two pence. As a result, the export trade came to a standstill, and the Japanese army did not obtain any of the foreign exchange left over from the export industry. Thus, another goal also failed. The Japanese now seem to be in a dilemma. Whether or not an order is issued, the Federal Reserve Bank's currency will fall along with the yen. Making the Federal Reserve Bank's currency closely follow the yen and restricting the free exchange between these two currencies will inevitably cause import and export trade to come to a standstill. If unlimited exchange is allowed, then it will inevitably cause the yen to continue to weaken.

### The New Fourth Army's Year of Anti-Japanese War Experience and Lessons, Xiang Ying (7)

Sixth, the coordination of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla warfare alone is not enough. It is necessary to simultaneously use mobile warfare, constantly annihilate the enemy, and cause the enemy greater losses. Only when the enemy's forces are not enough to allocate in such a large area of the country can they only guard a few strongholds and cannot maintain control over a vast area. Seventh, we believe that in the future, military and political command must be unified, so that military and political affairs meet the requirements of our war. In order to facilitate the war, political and military cooperation must be consistent. Eighth, economically blockade the enemy, and we must have a way to be self-sufficient. We believe that in terms of the trend of such a war and the enemy's dynamics, these principles and policies must be adopted to win the victory in the future war and the development and completion of the second stage of the war, so as to quickly prepare our forces and strive for the rapid arrival of our counter-offensive stage.

Final conclusion: Our conclusion is very simple. It is a combination of three conclusions into one general conclusion.

A. Based on the experience of the Anti-Japanese War over the past year, we should: (1) Develop the achievements and advantages we have gained in this year. (2) Correct the shortcomings that exist in our Anti-Japanese War this year.

B. Based on the lessons of the past year, we should: (1) Strengthen our political work and maximize the effectiveness of our political work. (2) Continuously improve our military technology to the necessary extent to meet the requirements of our operations. (3) Thoroughly eliminate the habits of guerrillaism and make our army completely regular. (4) Based on this lesson, consolidate and improve various systems, so that our army becomes the most flexible and most effective machine.

C. Based on the trend of future operations, we should: (1) Learn mobile warfare to combine guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare. (2) We must organize and launch guerrilla warfare among the masses everywhere. (3) Strengthen our publicity work and mass movement. (4) We must develop enemy army work (i.e., propaganda to the enemy army and strive for their rebellion) among the entire army, and turn it into the common work of all our combatants, and at the same time turn it into the anti-Japanese work of the broad masses. (5) Maintain and develop the excellent traditions of our New Fourth Army. And we must create our new excellent traditions and style. This is how we adapt to the combat missions of the twenty-eighth year, the anti-Japanese missions of the second stage, and complete the missions of the second stage. Only in this way can we become healthier day by day and overcome our weaknesses day by day. Our summary of the experience and lessons of the past year is not only to find out our achievements, but mainly to recognize where our achievements come from, and at the same time find out our weaknesses, what hinders us in the Anti-Japanese War, and how to overcome them? So that we become the healthiest and most powerful anti-Japanese army, so that we can make greater contributions in the second stage of the Anti-Japanese War and have greater victories to complete our mission! (The End)

The preparatory committee has now made appropriate allocations and can issue all of them this afternoon (3rd). However, since there are currently many child welfare organizations, and the number of refugee children is more than 40,000, it may be impossible to distribute them universally. The preparatory committee will handle the situation at its discretion.

Issuance of Passes

The total number of children who have signed up to visit the gardens this year is 9,397. All amusement park passes will be issued by the Shanghai Office of the Child Welfare Association starting at 2:00 p.m. today (3rd). Please send personnel from various organizations to collect them.

It is now learned that the Huguang Theater is also preparing to entertain refugee children with the screening of the film "Miss Tomboy." The theater plans to entertain 1,200 refugee children.

The situation is enthusiastic and can be called unprecedented.

### Guangxi Province Authorities Set This Year as Guangxi Province Adult Education Year, Implementation Plan Already Set

(Guilin Correspondence) Guangxi Province has designated the 28th year of the Republic of China as the "Adult Education Year" and has formulated an implementation plan for the Adult Education Year. Since 1934, Guangxi Province has combined compulsory education for children with adult literacy education into "National Basic Education" and has taken on the task of eliminating illiteracy. Therefore, the number of illiterates has gradually decreased. According to statistics, in 1935, there were a total of 3,369,999 out-of-school adults aged 18 to 45 in the province, accounting for 58% of the 5,777,287 adults in the province. In the past four years, a total of 1,550,425 people have been reduced. As of the end of 1938, only 1,863,995 people remained. According to this statistic, the total reduction in four years was more than 46%. The "Adult Education Year" aims to eliminate the remaining adult illiterates, which account for more than 55%. (The reason why the percentage exceeds 100% is that the rate at which children become adult illiterates is higher than the mortality rate of adult illiterates). As for the implementation plan, there are a total of 19 chapters and 64 articles. The 19 chapters are titled: Main Purpose, Objectives, Implementation Principles, Organization Setup and Equipment, Enrollment and Staffing, Teachers, Curriculum and Teaching Materials, Teaching, Guidance, Graduation, Continuing Education, Special Ethnic Group Education, Supervision, Assessment, Funding, Implementation Procedures, Summary, and Supplementary Provisions. In addition, the following methods are also stipulated: (1) Students must be pure illiterates aged 18 to 45 who have never attended school or who have attended school but cannot understand the texts of volumes 1 and 2 of the People's School textbook. (2) Teaching adopts a class system, with a minimum of 25 people and a maximum of 50 people per class. Classes should be separated by gender in principle. Each county should hold at least two "Exemplary Adult Classes." Students should not only use coercive methods to enroll, but also use lotteries in stages, with four terms per year, each term lasting two months, and classes lasting two hours per day. Adult classes should be established by national basic schools at all levels, private secondary schools above the county level, and local cultural and industrial groups, and existing equipment should be used as much as possible. (3) There are five types of courses: 1. Anti-Japanese Speech; 2. National Language; 3. Current Affairs Reports; 4. Anti-Japanese Songs; 5. Assembly Activities. (4) Guidance standards are divided into: Political New Life Movement, Propaganda Work, Production Knowledge and Skills, Rescue Training, and Special Training for Women. (5) There are four sources of teachers: 1. Transfer the directors of the guidance departments of the central basic schools; 2. Transfer teachers from basic schools at all levels; 3. Transfer surplus teachers from each county who have been adjusted according to the Guangxi Province Wartime Basic Education Implementation Measures; 4. If the number of people dispatched from the above items is insufficient, then public officials and intellectuals will be dispatched to supplement the number. According to the above total number of illiterates, which is 1,863,995, assuming 40 per class, there are a total of 46,600 classes. Divided into four terms, there are 11,700 classes per term. Stipulating that each teacher teaches two classes, there are a total of 5,850 teachers needed. There are 2,291 directors of guidance at the central basic schools. The main teachers from the third source above are exempt from the obligation to perform corvée labor and military service during their service period. (6) The budget for expenses is 92,200 yuan for office expenses, 233,000 yuan for teacher subsidies (5 yuan for each completed class), and 355,900 yuan for teacher living expenses (10 yuan per person per month, calculated for ten months), plus travel expenses for provincial supervisors and reserve expenses, totaling 931,100 yuan, with an average cost of 20 yuan per class and a cost of 5 jiao to eliminate one illiterate. Textbooks are separate. Last year, the Ministry issued 3 million sets of People's School textbooks, and students also provide their own stationery. At the beginning of the event, teachers are trained first. Each county concentrates on its own, with a week as the duration. The training subjects are: Adult Education Notes, Mass Organization and Training, How the Masses Resist Japan, Outline of Anti-Japanese Propaganda, Outline of Guangxi Construction, Spiritual Speech, Anti-Japanese Songs, Air Defense and Poison Prevention, etc. There are three levels of promotion agencies: 1. Provincial Government; 2. Commanders of the People's Regiments in each district; 3. County Government. In addition, the province has established a "Provincial Adult Education Year Promotion Committee" and the county has established a "County Promotion Committee" to be responsible for the design and promotion of adult education in the province and county. As for the adult education methods for special ethnic groups such as the Miao and Yao, "Guangxi has special ethnic groups such as the Miao, Yao, Dong, and Zhuang, totaling more than 300,000, scattered in 49 counties (excluding the Zhuang, who number more than 5 million, accounting for about five-thirteenths of the province's population, but because they have been deeply assimilated by the Han people, only the language is different, so they are not regarded as a particularly serious problem). They live in poverty, and most of them have languages but no writing. Several years ago, a special teacher training institute was established, but the teachers trained are not enough to distribute. The initial step in eliminating the illiterate of special ethnic groups with low culture and different languages is to start with teaching Chinese characters, so that they feel that learning foreign languages is the same. I am afraid there will be problems if they can go through it." It will be formulated separately, and it has not yet been formulated. For adult illiterates from special ethnic groups, because the problems of teaching materials and writing are greater than economic problems, it is not a problem of Guangxi Province alone. The Ministry of Education should be asked to invite experts in ethnic, language, writing education, and other aspects to jointly discuss effective solutions.

Chairman of Zhejiang Province Increases Funding for Western Zhejiang Middle School

Sends a Telegram to the Central Government Requesting Disaster Relief Funds

Zhejiang Correspondence: The enrollment of the Temporary Middle School in Western Zhejiang has already passed, but young people from the war zone and guerrilla zone, regardless of whether the enrollment time has passed or not, and regardless of whether they are admitted or not, are always coming in droves. The problems have therefore arisen. First, the original quota has long been exceeded. Second, there is no way to get funding. The salaries of teachers and staff have been reduced again and again. Up to now, not a penny has been paid, and in fact, it still cannot be spent. Third, even student accommodation and meals cannot be solved. Recently, Provincial Chairman Huang went to the school to observe the various difficult situations and expressed his great emotion. He has approved the school authorities' request to prepare to increase funding, so as to accommodate as many out-of-school young people as possible and train a large number of new cadres. At the same time, he also ordered the county magistrates of the war zone and guerrilla zone to encourage young people with achievements in the war zone to study in the rear as much as possible. Regarding disaster relief funds, in addition to the assistance provided by the province, a telegram was sent to the Central Disaster Relief Committee to request assistance. In addition, Provincial Inspector Chen Chuanwen also went to Yuqian the day before yesterday to visit the school and observe.

The Shanghai National Arts Sports Congress has broken past records in terms of the number of participants, and the situation is unprecedented. Yesterday, Chu Minyi donated many valuable prizes. Since this National Arts Sports Congress is charitable in nature, the sales of tickets from all parties have been excellent. Unfortunately, the weather was not good. There were continuous cloudy and rainy nights the day before yesterday and yesterday. Yesterday morning, there were also drizzling rain, so it was decided to postpone it to this Sunday (April 9th), starting at 9:00 a.m., still at the private Shanghai Middle School at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The tickets that have been sold are still valid. The staff of the conference and all the contestants were also notified separately yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. by the Commercial Radio Station (wave 1060).

### Yesterday's Triangle Cross-Country Race: Dispute Arises; Runners Go Astray; Re-run on the 9th of This Month

The second "Shun Kee Cup" cross-country triangle race, with participants from the Huizhen, Hongkou, and French Army teams, started at 7:30 yesterday morning in the rain in front of Minzhi Middle School. Huizhen won the championship with absolute dominance, with team members Liu Guangfa, Huang Jinfu, and Lin Guoyou taking the top three places. Hongkou's Wan Jinsheng finished fourth. However, after the race, the French Army team reported that Huizhen's Ma Riji, between Daxilu and Haigelu, went via Yidingpanlu. Two French Army team members also committed the same violation. The French Army dispatched two military vehicles for support along the route, and an ambulance followed. However, the ambulance mistakenly took the wrong route, and Ma Riji and the two French Army team members followed the ambulance, leading them astray. According to the rules, all three were disqualified. After reviewing the team scores, Huizhen had less than 30 points. The difference between Hongkou and the French Army was significant, so Huizhen should retain the championship title. However, due to the aforementioned incident, both sides held their own positions, almost leading to unpleasantness. Later, the race organizer, Liang Yaoting, mediated the situation and explained that the dispute was actually caused by the French Army's ambulance. To emphasize sportsmanship and preserve friendly relations, this race was treated as a practice race. The scores for all three teams were not counted, and a re-run was scheduled for the 9th (Sunday) at the same location.

Economic Supplement

### The Yen and the Sword

— Te Gong

This article was written by Mr. Guenther Stein in Hong Kong at the end of last year, originally titled "The Yen and the Sword" in "Pacific Affairs," published in March of this year. The journal just arrived in Shanghai and was reprinted in "The China Weekly Review" published on April 1st. The fact that it was reprinted demonstrates its importance. Now, we are grateful to Mr. Wu Te Gong of this newspaper for taking the time to translate it for this publication. Mr. Wu's translations have long been praised, and he is known as a famous translator of renowned works. This publication convened a symposium of monetary experts on this issue the previous week. The minutes of that meeting were published in the previous issue of this publication. Now, we are adding an outsider's perspective on this issue, which can be even more beneficial. We hope readers will pay attention! Unfortunately, due to the limited space of this publication, it can only be published in two installments. We hope the translator and readers will forgive us. Editor

The previous issue of this publication contained a record of the symposium discussing the issue of Japanese control of finance in North China, which was well-received by readers. Now, we have come across an article on the same topic by the famous American economic journalist Gueuther Steiu, which is sufficient to supplement the opinions expressed by the gentlemen at the symposium that day. We have hastily translated it and present it below. Reading this article, it can be seen that Japan's war against China, even if it does not fail due to major military setbacks, will inevitably fail due to economic helplessness. As long as China can persevere in the war of resistance and never give up until the final victory is achieved, there is no doubt about it.

Monetary Skirmishes Before the Sino-Japanese War

Currency has proven to be one of the decisive weapons in this Sino-Japanese War. Although many close observers of the war have underestimated the importance of currency, both China and Japan have long understood this fact. The Sino-Japanese currency war had been actively underway for approximately two years before actual military hostilities broke out. In early 1935, the Japanese took the offensive, attempting to link the currency of North China to the "Yen Bloc." They fully expected that the five major northern provinces could be separated from the central government by this method, and that Japan could completely conquer them without shedding a single drop of blood or firing a single bullet. They imposed this tactic on the unwilling nation not only with diplomatic and military pressure, but also by exploiting various chaotic political activities in the north. Originally, China's old silver currency was in a dangerous state, and the Japanese felt that there was ample opportunity to take direct aggressive action in the financial market. The method they adopted was to engage in looting China's silver, which was the legal tender in its northern provinces.

Therefore, Japan sent personnel to North China to purchase silver coins and silver bars at abnormally low exchange rates against foreign currencies. Under the careful guidance of the local Japanese authorities, this was carried out smoothly and yielded substantial results. Although the Chinese government had issued a ban on the export of silver, it was ultimately unable to stop the smuggling of silver to Japan. The total amount transported to Japan was not recorded in official import reports. However, once it arrived in Japan, it could be openly transferred to England. According to Japanese foreign trade statistics, a total of 275 million yen worth of silver was transported to England from 1934 to 1936. Needless to say, this silver all came from China, as Japan is not a silver-producing country. After the silver arrived in London, it was sold at the high world market price maintained by the US government's silver purchasing policy, yielding substantial profits. However, the profit-making aspect was a coincidence. The true motive behind Japan's movement was not to seek profit, but to loot the deeply rooted monetary reserves of North China, making it unable to maintain its financial position, and then forcing it to fall into the grasp of the "Yen Bloc," and in the future, gradually dispose of the entire China in the same way.

Although this attack caused great losses to China, it failed to achieve Japan's main goal. Because the Chinese government responded decisively and suddenly implemented currency reform on November 3, 1935. Although this measure was somewhat late, it was still a remedial action. As a result, silver was completely nationalized and no longer served as legal tender, nor was it allowed to circulate on the market. Instead, paper money issued by government banks was used as a substitute. In other words, China had adopted a "managed" currency to avoid Japanese attacks, as most other countries had done before. China immediately set about collecting all the silver still remaining in the country. The government was able to collect at least one hundred million yuan (Chinese currency). China had therefore taken a step ahead of Japan. Because this silver could not only serve as a hard currency reserve for the new paper money in peacetime, but also serve as a potential emergency fund in times of war, freely disposed of by the government for purchasing military supplies overseas.

China's logical counter-actions in the undeclared currency war, especially the latter, made the Japanese greatly uneasy. As a result, Japan's political attitude towards China and Britain turned sharply. The reason why she hated Britain was because it was rumored that China's counter-actions were instigated by Britain. At first, Japan firmly believed that China's currency reform would fail in the short term from a purely economic perspective. She believed that China was a backward, only semi-unified, and unmanageable country. The government's power and credibility were insufficient to successfully implement the modern state-managed currency. Furthermore, the Chinese people had been accustomed to using silver for thousands of years. Now, suddenly asking them to switch to paper money, which could be used to purchase foreign exchange but could not be exchanged for cash, would not gain their trust. Although the Chinese government's reform had averted a monetary crisis, new crises would soon arise, even more severe than the previous one. At that time, the "Yen Bloc" would have all sorts of unexpected opportunities for expansion. Who knew that China's currency reform would proceed smoothly and achieve remarkable results? As a result, the general economic progress was so rapid that it exceeded the Chinese government's expectations. When this reform had clearly become a tool used by the Chinese government to rapidly increase national political unity and overseas credit, panic in some aspects of Japan grew.

The Amazing Power of Legal Tender in the War of Resistance

It would be an exaggeration to say that Japan's decision to launch an armed invasion of China was entirely due to the effects of China's currency reform, but history will prove that this was a major reason for Japan's war. Because the ambition to incorporate vast areas of China into the "Yen Bloc," although certainly not the sole purpose of Japan's operations in China, often surfaced in her plans for the future, and was greater than generally imagined. Japan's great military machine was ultimately engaged in large-scale movements in China. The currency weapon was of course crucial at the moment, but it was not shelved for long. Japan never forgot her original purpose. Therefore, after the establishment of the new puppet regime in Beiping, the first two plans she urged to implement were intended to lay the foundation for the expansion of the "Yen Bloc" in the occupied areas: (1) The establishment of the "United Reserve Bank of China," so that the paper money it issued would depend on the yen; (2) The promulgation of new tax rules to reduce population taxes, facilitating the expansion of Japanese trade within the new sphere of influence of the yen.

China also greatly relied on the fighting value of the newly forged currency weapon. Initially, for purely financial and self-defense reasons, silver was nationalized, and the resulting war fund, which was at least equal to half of the gold reserves of the Bank of Japan, was fully controlled and utilized by the government. This is a major factor in China's ability to exert the amazing ability to resist for a long time. But China also knew how to use the currency weapon itself to defend itself, and defended it very thoroughly. Wherever the Chinese regular army encountered the Japanese army, which had superior equipment, and had to retreat, in addition to leaving many guerrillas to harass the rear of the victors, they also left one thing that even made the Japanese army heartbroken: that was paper money. The Japanese hoped to incorporate the occupied areas into the "Yen Bloc," force the Chinese people to cooperate with the Japanese, develop economic resources to the extreme, and obtain new industrial and financial strength from military occupation. All these plans were reduced to nothing because China's legal tender was just a piece of paper.

China's currency resistance to the deeply rooted attempts by the Japanese in the occupied areas has had such a great effect, and this is not a lucky success. After two years of perfect control in peacetime, the new legal tender gained the trust of the people, and the government was able to carry out active policies based on this trust, even in areas under Japanese control. The main purpose of this policy was to maintain the inherent price of Chinese legal tender, which was higher than the yen, or any new currency that the Japanese forced to use in the occupied areas with the tips of their bayonets and which depended on the yen. This means that legal tender can still be freely exchanged for foreign currency, while holders of yen or yen-affiliated currencies cannot enjoy this important convenience. In order to maintain this solid principle, China had to sacrifice a large part of the foreign exchange reserves obtained from selling nationalized silver abroad. Even at this time, legal tender could still be exchanged for foreign exchange. These reserves flowed out continuously (mostly due to short-selling speculation), causing the value of legal tender to gradually decrease to half of its original value during the year and a half of costly war. However, although the value of legal tender fell, it also dragged down the value of "Yen Bloc" currencies within China to the same extent. The general public still prefers to use Chinese legal tender. Its strong credit, widespread circulation, and solid foundation are exactly the same as before the devaluation.

At the end of 1938, the Sino-Japanese currency war was at a stalemate. China, with its shrewd and firm policies, had been able to reduce the outflow of its greatly reduced foreign exchange reserves, with the outflow in some months almost zero. Although Guangzhou and Wuhan had fallen, and China had not received foreign financial assistance, China was still able to balance its income and foreign exchange obligations. Therefore, China can continue to maintain a stable legal tender almost indefinitely, and at the same time can overturn the "Yen Bloc's" grand plan - at least this situation will not change until Japan has developed an effective new offensive. Japan, on the other hand, can only move step by step and remain on the defensive; this is certainly not because her old ambitions lack any enthusiasm, but because she has encountered major difficulties that she has not yet overcome.

The Yen's Sword and Background

At the same time, the "Yen Bloc," which originally included Japan, Korea, Taiwan, "Manchukuo," and the Kwantung Leased Territory, has been expanded in a nominally effective way to North China; and in an even more nominally effective state to the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China; as for the expansion of the group to South China, that is extremely weak. The Japanese side has never announced the actual procedures or actual conditions of this move, but analyzing this matter, it can be seen that its two major purposes and its current development status are: (1) To facilitate the expansion of Japanese exports to military-occupied areas; (2) To allow Japan to freely import goods from these areas without any expenditure of foreign exchange; this move can also allow Japan to sell surplus products in these areas overseas, and all the foreign exchange obtained will be used exclusively by her, regardless of the damage caused to the local area. The reason why the Japanese want to implement full currency control in these areas is not only to achieve these two purposes, but also to use this as a powerful lever to promote Japan's general economic development, and the method of promotion will of course suit the wishes of the Japanese military and Japan's own economic needs.

Japan must continuously expand her export sales, which is due to the implementation of two conflicting policies within Japan: one is to restrict rather than increase the purchasing power of her own people; the other is to increase the production of domestic manufacturing industries to the extreme of its technical capabilities. The volume of Japan's export trade has indeed grown surprisingly recently. From 1931, when the "Manchurian Incident" occurred, to 1936, the year before the Sino-Japanese War broke out, it increased by a full hundred percent in these five years. The development of foreign trade, at least in part, was achieved by reducing selling prices and making great sacrifices to the country. If war preparations had not absorbed the increased output of Japanese industry, then the gap between Japanese domestic purchasing power and the quantity of goods manufactured by Japanese industry would not have been filled by increased export sales. Military and industrial war preparations also have the purpose of continuing to increase exports. If the current war against China cannot achieve the hoped-for results in seeking a solution within the expanded "Yen Bloc," the problem will be more difficult in the future. Judging from the following circumstances, Japan's chances of winning the export problem by seizing the Chinese market are indeed very slim, and it is even impossible to greatly alleviate the difficulties of the problem. However, this unfavorable situation has added to Japan's reasons for seeking to subordinate the Chinese economy (to the Yen Bloc), so that it can fully develop whatever trade opportunities it encounters in China to the fullest possible extent.

### Foreign Exchange Stabilization and the Black Market Exchange Rate

— Zhang Liu

Mr. Zhang Liu is a pen name of a certain economic expert, and is highly regarded for his familiarity with the financial market situation. This article is a powerful prediction of the future of the foreign exchange black market, and those concerned about this issue should pay attention to it.

Editor

I. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Black Market

The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has been established in Hong Kong. The so-called stabilization fund is, of course, to stabilize the exchange rate of legal tender. But in reality, China already has two exchange rates: the official rate quoted by the Central Bank, and the private rate in the black market. So, in the future, which exchange rate will the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund implement stabilization on, the official rate or the private rate?

Based on the following reasons, we assume that the exchange rate to be stabilized in the future will be the private rate, not the official rate. Because:

First, the Central Bank's exchange rate has been extremely stable to this day, remaining unchanged from the original quotation, and there is no need for stabilization at all. Moreover, since the currency reform, the government has had special funds for the stabilization fund in London and New York. After the emergence of the black market, the Bank of China also stepped in to adjust (see Mr. Song Ziwen's remarks). Comparing the black market exchange rate at that time with the subsequent exchange rate, it can be seen that China's Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund has been profitable. In other words, even if China's foreign exchange fund has not increased after the war, it will certainly not suffer losses. In this way, there is naturally no need to replenish the foreign exchange fund, and this established fund will naturally be used to stabilize the black market.

Second, this is determined by the existence of the black market exchange rate. Because if the black market does not exist, then there is only one exchange rate, and naturally there is no need to ask which one to stabilize. Practically speaking, assuming that British and American banks are determined and willing to help China's national banks to eliminate the black market, it does not seem impossible. However, in the current market situation, since they can easily obtain goods worth one yuan in Chinese currency for eight pence, why would they want to be fools who exchange at the official rate of one shilling and two and a half pence?

Third, when the Foreign Exchange Fund was established, London issued a statement that it was beneficial to British commerce. And currently, almost all international trade is concentrated in the black market, so the so-called benefit naturally refers to the black market. Judging from the position of the committee banks: HSBC and Mercantile Bank are commercial banks. Although the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are both known as national bank systems alongside the Central Bank, they also occupy an important position among commercial banks. If it were to stabilize the official rate, there should be the Central Bank involved. Furthermore, judging from the location of the establishment, if it were China's foreign exchange agency, the central hub should be located in Chongqing, and Hong Kong should be an office. But this Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is clearly originating in London and focusing on Hong Kong, so its stabilization target must also be to stabilize the black market and facilitate Sino-British trade without doubt.

II. Nine Pence or Eight Pence?

Since the existence of the foreign exchange black market, the market price has generally been declining, from the initial one shilling and two and a half pence to around eight pence and a quarter recently. However, there is a special feature, that is, the market price has shown particular stability in the last three months. From the experience of observing the trend of stability: (1) When there is a large amount of release, Mercantile Bank and HSBC are often the absorbers; (2) When the position is very tight, Mercantile Bank and HSBC are often the suppliers; (3) After the market price rises above eight pence and a quarter, it will soon return to eight pence and a quarter; and when the market price falls below eight pence and a quarter, it will soon balance above eight pence and a quarter. From points (1) and (2), it is clear that HSBC and Mercantile Bank are actually undertaking the work of stabilizing the exchange market. From point (3), it is clear that the standard in the foreign exchange black market has stabilized above eight pence and a quarter.

After the news of the Foreign Exchange Fund came out, it was known that Mercantile Bank and HSBC were originally the responsible parties in the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. So, what will be the future black market balance standard?

(1) One theory is to raise it to nine pence, on the grounds that the exchange rate of eight and a half pence or eight pence and a quarter is too far from the legal official rate. It is rumored that Shanghai foreign merchants and import/export firms have requested to be given foreign exchange at nine pence. The level of eight pence and a quarter has been stable for several months. If it is suddenly lengthened, it will immediately give the financial market a contraction effect. Therefore, starting from the current rate, raising the exchange rate to nine pence is most likely.

(2) There is also a theory that the exchange market will not move and will always stabilize above the current price of eight pence and a quarter. The reason is that the current price has been stable for several months. The stimulus caused by the devaluation of the exchange rate has instead given Shanghai the benefit of raising prices, resulting in a special boom. If countries want to support trade, they must maintain this boom, which also means they must maintain the level of a low exchange rate.

(3) There is another theory that the foreign exchange black market will have no level of ups and downs in the future. The task of the Foreign Exchange Committee is indeed to stabilize the foreign exchange black market, but not to supply the foreign exchange black market. Therefore, the Foreign Exchange Committee may use a subsidy method for legitimate British traders in the future, so that British merchants can purchase foreign exchange at a market price of nine pence. As for other merchants, they will be ignored. At the same time, for the foreign exchange trading in the black market, the method of "absorbing as much as possible when the position is large, and releasing it to a certain limit when the position is small" will still be used to stabilize the exchange market.

The above three theories all have some reasons and some possibilities. The recent market situation still does not show what method the authorities will adopt. However, a few points can be decided in advance: First, it is generally impossible for the foreign exchange black market to shrink further. Second, the Foreign Exchange Fund Committee will directly participate in the foreign exchange black market. Perhaps using a certain standard, but not necessarily maintaining a certain standard.

III. The Future of the Black Market and the Official Rate

Some have long advocated lowering the official rate, in other words, abolishing the official rate and aligning with the black market. This proposal has not been realized and will not be realized. If it were realized, it would be harmful and not beneficial to China. If the official rate is abolished, it is tantamount to stating that the government has no sincerity in maintaining the original exchange rate. At the same time, the informal exchange rate in the black market, due to the abolition of the official rate, is implicitly given legal recognition. Therefore, it will definitely not be implemented in practice.

Finally, in terms of the essence of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund, the value of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund maintaining the black market is very little. Because the foreign exchange black market arises from China's management of foreign exchange. If the black market can be allowed to ask for whatever it wants, then why manage foreign exchange during wartime?

But conversely, it is ultimately beneficial to China. The increase in the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund indicates that China's monetary base is becoming increasingly solid. At the same time, since the committee is handled by Chinese and British experts, it will certainly not be used by third countries.

Book Review

### "Modern Monetary Thought and World Monetary Trends"

— Written by Mr. Yao Qingsan, Published by the National Economic Research Institute

Our country has never had a sound monetary system, and if there is one, it should start with the implementation of the new monetary policy. Before that, due to the sharp rise and fall of foreign silver prices, which were unpredictable, our country's economy was greatly affected, and even Chinese people who had no interest in economic research paid attention to the issue of currency. However, I believe that it is extremely rare and regrettable to be able to answer all questions in monetary science based on China's economic reality with my limited knowledge.

Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the pending case that has lingered in our minds has come to an end. However, this most advanced modern management currency has greatly transformed the history of world monetary science. It is true that since the Sino-Japanese War, our country's foreign exchange has been able to stabilize for more than half a year. Although a black market has emerged since the control of foreign exchange, and even the Japanese are now implementing a ban on the use of legal tender in "North China," the credibility of the circulation of legal tender has remained unshaken. This mystery has made the Chinese people greatly interested in monetary science. Therefore, it is increasingly felt that it is necessary to explain monetary theory based on the actual situation of our country. However, there is still nothing that can meet this need.

Now I have obtained Yao's book "Modern Monetary Thought and World Monetary Trends." Although it is a general discussion of modern monetary thought and general monetary systems, it has partially studied monetary theory in depth based on China's actual situation. It has been discovered that many authoritative monetary theories of modern times are not in line with China's actual situation, or even contradictory to it. For example, Professor Cassel advocates the Purchasing Power Parity theory, believing that when prices rise and fall, the exchange rate must change accordingly to correlate. However, based on the actual changes in China's exchange rate and prices in the past ten years, Yao has discovered that the change in the exchange rate often occurs after the change in prices. Therefore, this theory has been revised to "China's Purchasing Power Parity is actually governed by the exchange rate, not the exchange rate governed by the Purchasing Power Parity." Another example is Professor Fisher's Quantity Theory of Money, which is also used by general interpreters of the relationship between money and prices, believing that even if the total amount of transactions does not change, when the amount of currency changes, prices will inevitably change accordingly. However, after the author studied the actual situation of currency and prices in our country in recent years, it was felt that there was a causal reversal. Moreover, it is believed that "the change in the amount of currency does not necessarily conform to the change in the price level; even if the change in the amount of currency runs counter to the change in the price level; it can also be made by the change in the velocity of circulation to make the total value of goods and services transactions (PT) and the total amount of payments for all transactions (M'V') tend to balance within the same period." The value of Purchasing Power Parity and the Quantity Theory of Money has long been doubted by the world. However, the author may have started the re-evaluation of academics based on China's actual situation.

However, the greatest contribution of this book lies in re-evaluating all modern monetary thoughts one by one based on the latest facts and statistics. It enables the protectors to gain a correct understanding in academic theory. This opens up a path for the Chinese people to study European and American academics. What is this path? That is, to make judgments based on the environment in which we are located.

### Securities The Stock Market in a Week

Recently, the Shanghai stock market has been following the lead of the New York and London stock markets, and has been completely dominated by political news. At the beginning of last week, because the Italian Prime Minister's speech was still good, and the German-Polish agreement was concluded, it was believed that the European situation could be temporarily maintained. Therefore, investors and speculators acted together. By the weekend, due to the tense situation on the German-Polish border, Chamberlain suddenly roared, and the situation in Eastern Europe tended to worsen. New York securities followed suit and plummeted. Therefore, the public was again restrained and waited to see.

Several stocks still had new records last week, such as Jardine Matheson (36 yuan) and Jardine Matheson (20.50 yuan). The stock with the largest turnover was still Jardine Matheson, no less than 7 shares. The price at the beginning of the week continued the strong momentum of the previous Saturday, still opening at 20.50 yuan. Subsequently, due to the successive sales of profitable bulls, the price fell slightly by 2 or 3 angles. Then, due to the decline in yarn prices and the unfavorable international situation, it fell back into the 20 yuan level. On the weekend, it was as low as 19.20 yuan. Fortunately, someone absorbed it at a low price and returned to 19.50 yuan at the close.

The turnover of Shanghai Silver Company's stock was also strong last week, above 20,000 shares. The highest price was 6.20 yuan, and it fell to 5.90 yuan on Friday afternoon. There was no turnover on Saturday. The turnover of Jardine Matheson was more than 10,000 shares. The highest price was 36 yuan, the lowest was 34.25 yuan, and the weekend was 34.50 yuan. Trolley stock hovered around 40 yuan. The price of Ye Guang real estate has been as low as 9 yuan. At the weekend, the seller asked for 8.85 yuan, and there was no transaction. The Gonghexiang Wharf stock is quite favored by investors. After deducting 10 yuan in interest at the weekend, the buyer offered 195 yuan, and the seller asked for 200 yuan.

The turnover of various bonds last week reflected the abundance of funds in the city. Among them, the 5% bonds of the Electric Power Company had the most turnover, followed by Puyi Real Estate, and the Shanghai Municipal Bonds (Republic of China 21st Year) also had 3,400 yuan of turnover, with a price of 56.50 yuan. As for rubber stocks, except for English Zhaohua, Qiaolao Buddha, etc., which had a little embellishment, the rest were never asked about. In addition, the Longhai Road bonds were traded for 5,000 pounds, with a price of 18 yuan. The Sino-French US dollar bonds (no seal) were traded for 600 yuan, with a price of 63%. The turnover from March 24th to March 30th is listed below.

Last week, in the Chinese Securities Market, the Chinese stock market was firm. It was heard that Nanyang Tobacco is expected to pay interest soon. On Friday, 50 shares were traded, with a price of 6.50 yuan, an increase of half a yuan compared to before. On Saturday, it rose another angle to 5 points, and 400 shares were traded. The buyer of China Merchants Securities stock offered 28.50 yuan, which was also half a yuan higher than before, while the seller asked for 29 yuan, and no transaction was made. 200 shares of Yarn Exchange shares were traded on Monday, and the price was still 38 yuan. 70 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded on Thursday, and the price was 6.50 yuan.

### Grain Dumai Arrivals Are Relatively Strong, Market Prices Vary

Yesterday, various gangs came from the source, and a total of 12 cars were transported down the river, including Su Tong gang and Kunshan gang, etc., with more than 3,000 packages. However, the sales market was slack, and the hoarding households were also indifferent, and there were more arrivals, so the sellers' thoughts were not as firm as before. Those who were willing to sell made slight concessions, and those who were unwilling still had the intention of persisting, resulting in a mixed situation in the market. Thick and thin japonica rice and high-quality dumplings kept the original price, and there was not much fluctuation. However, the river goods have been repaired by a few points to a corner. Duyang tip and pointed goods are scarce, and still set, and the way to change the yuan is still stagnant, falling by one or two corners.

### Sugar Market 10,000 Bags of Taikoo Sugar Traded in May

The sugar market was tight the day before yesterday due to the recent lack of cargo for thick and white, and five yuan and one angle in September failed to trade. 10,000 bags of Taikoo sugar in May were traded at 9 yuan and 5 and a half angles in Hong Kong dollars, and then rose by one angle to 9 yuan and 6 and a half angles. However, the reply was not transferred, which shows a glimpse of the tight situation. The guild’s drawing board, 24 thick white transit goods suddenly rose by 3 angles, and 300 bags were traded at 17 yuan. The spot market outside the warehouse delivered at 24 yuan and 9 angles, the warehouse delivered at 25 yuan, and the Da Jin Qian mark at 25 yuan and 3 angles. The Taikoo A mark rose by one angle to 24 yuan and 7 and a half angles, and the Taikoo Chebai B mark rose by 5 points, with the West Warehouse at 24 yuan and 8 and a half angles, and the East Warehouse at 24 yuan and 7 angles. OW mark six angles, CX mark five angles, DY mark three angles, HX mark two and a half angles, and the national sugar Shantou cotton white also appeared to be tight, rising by two or three angles, opening at 23 yuan, 5 and 6 angles, and trading 300 outer packages. The Shimen Slices Qing has not changed much, with more than 100 packages traded at 11 yuan and 3 angles.

### Dried and Fresh Produce Tong'an Dried Longan Continues to Arrive

Tong'an sun-dried dried longan has been slow to arrive since the red plate was opened. After checking, the Shenguang wheel entered the port from Quanzhou the day before yesterday, and 45 pieces were transferred, all of which were small boxes, with a total weight of less than 40 dans. According to the letter from the guest party, the cost is higher than before, so the market is gradually becoming tight, and there may be a slight increase.

### Piece Goods Spring Woolens Are Selling Well

Light gray and light-colored woolens are now selling well due to the approach of Qingming Festival this spring. Yesterday, fabrics such as Palikas yarn wool, Wanli Ding flannel, and light-colored spring thin flower woolens were selling well. Among them, woolen cloth with Western characters on the selvage (transliterated as Shimeitaikesi) is very popular, because both pullover and spring coat styles are popular. Deep and light colors, and stripes, checks, and solids are all available. It is said that wide stripes are fashionable and sell well. The first batch has been sold out, and the next batch needs to be imported in a week. The wholesale price is 12 yuan and 5 angles in national currency per yard.

Zhi Nail and Sub Nail Are Becoming More Lively

In the hardware trade, both the customer gang factory and the family came to purchase yesterday, and the turnover of various hardware goods still reached 3,000 to 4,000 dans. The market situation has little change, but the situation of Zhi nail and Yuan nail was unusually lively the day before yesterday. The individual situation is described separately below.

The Customer Sales of Zhi Nails Are Unusually Developed Zhi nails (also known as sesame nails) sales were the most in the local shoe market more than ten years ago. Other factories also had some embellishments from time to time. The customer gang sales have rarely developed. Recently, the situation has changed completely. Gangs from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai have purchased them one after another. A total of 500 boxes were opened the day before yesterday, with a market price of 46 yuan and 5 angles per box for three points, 43 yuan and 5 angles for four points, 42 yuan and 5 angles for five points, and 41 yuan and 5 angles for six points. Because the factory's shipment is not much, people's hearts are very good, so each plate is one yuan better than before. However, the business in this street has been unusually rare recently. Except for a few purchases in the market, there is no large-scale transaction. The Road to Sub Nails Is the Largest Sub Nail Business The local factory and the Small Hardware Gang are very happy to buy Sub Nail, and the factory's shipments are not much. There is often a shortage of goods in the market, so the price is very strong. Four points are sold for 36 yuan per barrel, five points for 31 yuan, and six points for 26 yuan. Fifty or sixty barrels were opened the day before yesterday, all opened by hardware shops in the North Suzhou Road area. The Tianjin Gang handled the customer road transaction for only ten or so barrels, and other gangs rarely touched it. As for the market situation, according to the people in the industry, because the factory's shipments are very few, they are often not enough to meet the buyers' needs, so it is not easy to relax the price in the later market.

Thin Iron Prices Fall Sharply

The thin iron market was previously rare due to the arrival of goods, and there was little inventory, which led to a soaring market standard. The highest price was sold at 135 yuan per box. Recently, because of the arrival of wild chicken goods, the quoted price of the regular goods was dragged down. Recently, each box is only sold for 115 yuan, but the transaction is still rare. Only ten or so boxes were traded yesterday, and they were handled by Xiangyan factories. Other biscuit companies, toy factories, etc. only asked. As for the wild chicken goods market, it has been very lively recently, and the quoted price is only 78 yuan per box. Can factories, cigarette factories, and toy factories all have some embellishments. It was found that 50 or 60 boxes were traded yesterday, all opened by hardware shops in the North Suzhou Road area.

### Wen and Yong are Ordered to Find Ways to Disperse Accumulated Goods Wen and Yong Chambers of Commerce Invite All Industries to Discuss and Decide on Measures That Have Been Implemented

Since the tense situation in Eastern Zhejiang, the coastal and river areas have been closely guarded. The Oujiang River in Wen and the Yongjiang River in Yong will be completely blocked when necessary. Now the two places have been ordered to disperse accumulated goods, and the local chambers of commerce have invited all industries to discuss and disperse them. The details are as follows

Find Ways to Disperse Accumulated Goods in Both Places

Wenzhou and Ningbo had a large backlog of local goods such as cotton, casings, silk cocoons, egg products, tea, tung oil, and cloth in the two ports due to the customs prohibition of goods being shipped to Shanghai. Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced the examination and approval measures for prohibited goods shipped to Shanghai, the obstructed local goods have been guaranteed by chambers of commerce and other guarantees, and released after verification. Now the two places have been ordered to find ways to disperse accumulated goods. After the two local chambers of commerce invited all industries to discuss, they decided (1) to try to ship out the blocked local goods as much as possible, (2) to move the imported goods that have arrived in Wenzhou and Yongbo to the rear in a short period of time.

Foreign Merchants Send Ships to Load and Transport Local Goods

The foreign ships that have been approved to sail to the Wenzhou and Ningbo ports in Eastern Zhejiang, such as British Taikoo, Italian Sino-Italian, Portuguese Meili, Zhengde, American China-America, German Lihe, Lulin, etc., have sent ships to sail the Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Yongbo, and Hong Kong-Yongbo, and Hong Kong-Wenzhou routes to undertake the export of local goods from Wenzhou and Yongbo. Therefore, many local goods have arrived in Shanghai and Hong Kong in recent days. The accumulated goods in Wenzhou and Yongbo have gradually decreased. As for imported goods, the through trains to southwestern China from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi have been suspended, and the goods to the southwest have been rerouted to Haiphong. Therefore, the outgoing goods of various foreign merchant ships have been drastically reduced.

### Italian Ambassador Has Arrived in Tianjin and Will Go to Ping Soon Italian Cruiser Will Go to Japan

The French Shanghai Daily reported that, according to Japanese sources, Italian Ambassador Ma Qiu recently arrived in Tianjin from Qinhuangdao and will stay in the port for two days. Afterwards, he will go to Beiping for a long-term residence. However, the cruiser he is on will go to Japan.

### After the Source Is Smooth, the Market Rice Price Is Stable The Total Stock of Rice in the Two Concessions Is 650,000 Bags The Entire People's Food Will Not Be Deficient for the Time Being

The people's food in the Shanghai Concession has been stabilized after the rice industry groups organized a rice price evaluation committee and made every effort to stabilize it. Now the source has been smoothed out and the inventory is sufficient. The market rice prices are all within the 14 yuan price limit, so the Shanghai people's food will not be deficient for the time being. The details are as follows

The Source Is Smooth The Rice Price Is Stable

After the Rice Price Evaluation Committee assessed the rice price at 14 yuan, the Market Management Committee implemented the price limit, cracked down on hoarding, speculation, and manipulation, and at the same time advised vendors to take the overall situation into account and try their best to purchase and transport rice from the producing areas to Shanghai for relief. Now, because the domestic rice price has fallen back to 1 yuan per stone, although the rice transported to Shanghai by vendors has no high profits, it will not be depleted, so the rice transported to Shanghai by inland rivers, railways, and foreign ships has gradually increased, and the market rice price can be stabilized. The general hoarders are afraid of being found out and punished by the committee, and they sell them one after another.

The Stock of Rice Is 650,000 Bags

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Zhang Nianxuan, a member of the Rice Price Evaluation Committee, yesterday. According to the discussion, the committee has sent people to investigate the stock of rice in the Public Concession and the French Concession. It is estimated that the current stock of rice is about 650,000 bags. These packages of rice are divided into two types: 1 stone, 2 dou and 1 stone, 5 dou. The total is about 800,000 to 950,000 stones. Although the arrival in Shanghai has decreased slightly in recent days due to the rainy weather, it is expected to increase after the weather clears. National rice from Suzhou, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Wuhu, and other places is being transported to Shanghai.

Rice Shop Door Sales Add a Commission

Member rice shops of the Rice Industry Association, in accordance with the association's resolution, have added a commission of 4 corners per stone for miscellaneous expenses for the price of rice sold at the door from April 1. Because each rice shop maintained the price limit in the past, no commission was added, resulting in losses. The commission and miscellaneous expenses are added to maintain the blood capital, and have no impact on the price limit. Therefore, the wholesale market price of first-class white rice is 14 yuan per dan, while the rice shop door sales are 14 yuan and 4 corners per stone. However, the association believes that the door sales market price cannot be considered to exceed the price limit.

### Eastern Zhejiang Has a Warm Anti-Japanese Sentiment Strong Men Voluntarily Join the Army Wenling Strong Men Correctly Unite Comrades to Join the Army Local Institutions Greet Each Other Extravagantly

Since the implementation of the conscription system in various parts of Eastern Zhejiang, strong men have been very enthusiastic about enlisting in the army. Wenling, Zhejiang Province, is located on the coast and has a closed atmosphere. In the past, ordinary strong men were afraid of conscription. Now, after the government's efforts to publicize, not only the conscripted strong men are happy to be soldiers, but also inspire many young strong men to take serving in the army to kill the enemy as a national responsibility. Li Yanding and other strong men from Henghe Township in the county specially united 40 comrades to go to the county to enlist. After learning about it, the county government immediately notified various institutions, groups, and schools to go to the outside of Sanxing Bridge to warmly welcome them, treat them favorably, hold a welcome meeting, and perform anti-Japanese dramas. When they set off to enter the camp, all sectors of society warmly welcomed them again. It is now heard that the 40 strong men have entered the camp to kill the enemy. It is heard that last year on the July 7th anniversary, all sectors of Wen held a torch parade, gathering up to more than 100,000 people. At present, Wenzhou is carrying out anti-war work very smoothly, and its will is particularly firm. The people of Dinghai, Haimen and other places are also very enthusiastic about the anti-war sentiment.

### Zhejiang Province Controls Transportation to Meet Wartime Demands: Promulgation of Control Guidelines

The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to strengthen transportation institutions, adjust water and land transportation, meet the demands of wartime transportation, and promote the sale of specialty products from the inland to promote new economic development, has specifically formulated the Zhejiang Province Wartime Water and Land Transportation Tool Control Measures Guidelines. It has been passed and implemented in meetings. Hereafter, all water and land transportation tools within the province, regardless of whether they are publicly or privately owned, mechanical or manual, and all tool owners and operators, must abide by these guidelines. The Transportation Department directly under the government will manage them separately according to the nature of the tools through the Ship Brigade, Automobile Brigade, and Handcart Brigade.

### The Japanese Army in Zhujing was Annihilated by the Self-Defense Corps; Zhujing Town was Simultaneously Recaptured; The Japanese Side has Deployed the Navy to Engage

Jinshan County is located on the coast and is a vital waterway for entering and exiting Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since the fall of Greater Shanghai, Jinshan has also fallen into enemy hands. In order to promote local armed forces and integrate them with the party, government, and military, the National Government appointed Xu XX as the county magistrate of Jinshan County and concurrently the head of the Self-Defense Corps, and Lu XX as the secretary-general of the county party headquarters. After receiving the order, Xu went to Jinshan three months ago to take office, entered the Japanese army's rear, and led the people to engage in anti-Japanese sabotage work. Over the past few months, the anti-Japanese self-defense corps organized by Xu leading the local people has been established and has repeatedly defeated the Japanese army, recovering more than a dozen towns. A few days ago, Xu personally led the self-defense corps from XX to attack the Japanese army entrenched in Zhujing. The battle between the two sides was fierce. Although the Japanese army held its fierce artillery fire and desperately resisted, the self-defense corps warriors still bravely charged and fought, and their momentum was unstoppable. Until they engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the Japanese army was unable to withstand it and was defeated. Xu then led his team to follow and pursue, and no Japanese soldier survived. In this battle, more than sixty Japanese soldiers were annihilated, more than twenty rifles, three machine guns, and several boxes of grenades were seized. The town was then recovered by the self-defense corps. It is reported that the Japanese side has mobilized the navy in an attempt to "counterattack." Under the leadership of Xu, the self-defense corps has made considerable arrangements.

Contents of Japanese Army Bunkers on Two Routes

The Japanese army on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes has been forcibly conscripting civilians in the countryside for days, and searching for wood, bricks, and stones to build bunkers at various stations along the lines to prevent guerrilla attacks. These bunkers are shaped like bell towers, about three feet high, with observation decks and machine gun positions, as well as speaking tubes for communicating with the lower-level Japanese army. Four towers are built at each large station, and two at each small station, totaling more than two hundred towers. Currently, the bunkers at the two major stations in Nanjing and Hangzhou have been completed, and the rest of the stations are currently being built. It is said that each bunker costs 10,000 Japanese yen to build.

The Puppet Regime Plans to Establish a "Anti-Communist Corps"

The Nanjing puppet "Reformed Government" has recently been actively planning to form an "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," using students from the Jiangwan "Reformed Academy" as basic cadres, and recruiting another 1,000 young people between the ages of sixteen and thirty-two as members, providing them with three months of training, and then assigning them to various places in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to be responsible for investigating "terrorist" elements. The estimated start-up cost is about 1.5 million, and the position of the future head of the corps may be held by Ren Yuandao, the puppet "Pacification Department" minister, and key Japanese personnel will be invited to serve as consultants. This conspiracy plan is in progress.

### Sir Sassoon Returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong; Many Foreign Businessmen Come with Him

Sir Sassoon, the richest Jewish man in this port, came to Shanghai from Washington last month regarding the issue of the Jewish refugees. Due to business needs, he recently stayed in Hong Kong for a short period of time. It is now known that Sir Sassoon has completed his affairs in Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai on the Empress of Asia on the first of this month. Dr. Peggy, who has traveled around the world, and many other well-known foreign businessmen in this port also came to Shanghai on the President Coolidge on the first of this month.

### Japanese Wounded Soldiers are Constantly Transported from Central China to Shanghai; Gongda Yarn Factory is Converted into a Hospital; Most of the Newly Arrived Wounded Soldiers are Young

According to foreign sources, since the Japanese launched the war of aggression against China, due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army on all fronts, the casualties have been unexpectedly heavy. Therefore, the Japanese soldiers who are constantly being sent to China are only being transported back to their country as piles of ashes. The shortage of domestic soldiers has reached the point where no more can be drawn. The situation is extremely miserable. Since the focus of the war shifted to Central China, the Japanese army's casualties have become even more severe. All wounded soldiers are mostly transported by Japanese warships from the Yangtze River to Shanghai for treatment. The Japanese wounded soldier hospitals originally set up in the Hongkou district were already full. Recently, as Japanese wounded soldiers from Central China continue to be transported to Shanghai, the Gongda Yarn Factory, which stores military materials, has also been temporarily converted into a wounded soldier hospital. It is reported that most of the newly arrived wounded soldiers are young people who have not yet reached the age of service and cannot withstand the hardships of the battlefield. Therefore, anti-war sentiments are extremely prevalent. When in the hospital, they often cry out of homesickness, which shows the collapse of the Japanese warlords.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is Operating as Usual, But Direct Trains to Zhejiang-Guangxi Have Stopped

A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that although direct trains from Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Hunan-Guangxi have been suspended, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Hunan-Guangxi lines are still operating as usual. However, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line ends at Guixi. Regarding the highways in Zhejiang Province, except for those along the coast and rivers related to military affairs, which have been dismantled, the remaining roads are operating as usual. There is definitely one or two passenger trains on each route every day. All parts of eastern Zhejiang are peaceful and the defenses are very solid. Outside rumors are not credible.

### Damaged Banknotes Can Be Exchanged at the Post Office; Four Banks Have Signed a Contract with the Post Office

After the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers were ordered by the Ministry of Finance to collect and exchange old and damaged banknotes as much as possible, it has been stipulated that the legal tender of each bank will be exchanged by each bank as much as possible. As for the Zhejiang Xingye, Agricultural and Commercial, Agricultural and Industrial, Sining, Tongshang, and Zhejiang Bao banks, the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers are designated to collect and exchange them on their behalf. In places where the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers are not located, the post office was responsible for exchanging them before the war, and the four banks had signed a contract with the post office. After the war, the post office stopped exchanging them due to the expiration of the contract. Now the four banks have signed a contract with the post office again to continue the exchange.

### The Government Exerts Itself to Eliminate Import Surpluses at Various Customs Stations; Tianjin and Shanghai's Power over Opium and Cigarette Matters is Insufficient to Overcome Difficulties; Trade at Mengzi and Shantou Customs is in Surplus

After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance managed the country's foreign trade, it exerted itself to restrict imports and promote exports, reduce the import surplus, and, apart from customs in occupied areas where its authority does not extend, tried to eliminate import surpluses at various customs stations to replenish foreign exchange reserves and complete the cause of resistance and construction. Details are recorded as follows:

The Overall Import Surplus is Gradually Decreasing

The country's foreign trade has always been in surplus. For example, in 1932, the import surplus was 86,719,100 yuan. The government then tried its best to eliminate it, so it gradually decreased. In 1933, it was 73,373,900 yuan, in 1934, it was 49,445,100 yuan, in 1935, it was 34,340,200 yuan, in 1936, it was 23,580,300 yuan, in 1937, it was 11,513,000 yuan, and in 1938, it was 12,355,800 yuan. However, after the war, in September, October, November, and December of 1937, there were all trade surpluses. Since October of 1938, it has turned into an import surplus again.

Tianjin and Shanghai's Power over Opium and Cigarette Matters is Insufficient

The customs station with the largest import surplus from January to February of this year was Tianjin, with 26,859,000 yuan. Shanghai was second, with 14,486,000 yuan. Jiaozhou was next, with 7,197,000 yuan. Yantai was 2,766,000 yuan. The customs station with the largest export surplus was Mengzi, with 2,342,000 yuan. Shantou was second, with 1,588,000 yuan. Beihai was next, with 789,000 yuan. Wenzhou was 738,000 yuan. The customs stations with import surpluses are all in occupied areas, and the customs stations with export surpluses are all in non-occupied areas, which proves that the government has made every effort to eliminate the import surplus after the war. However, it is impossible to eliminate it in the occupied areas because its authority does not extend there.

Japanese Goods Dumped in Occupied Areas

After the war, a large amount of Japanese goods was imported and dumped in the occupied areas, so the occupied areas are full of Japanese goods. In 1938, the import of Japanese goods was valued at 20,986,400 yuan in national currency, ranking first among the imports from all countries to China. The ports of entry for these goods were Shanghai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, Jiaozhou, etc. As for the customs stations in non-occupied areas, the import of Japanese goods has disappeared. Imported Japanese goods are mainly cotton cloth, piece goods, rayon, seafood, flour, liquor, sundries, etc. As for goods from Britain, the United States, and third countries, they cannot be sold to occupied areas due to Japanese obstruction.

### Kidney Deficiency in Men: The Crisis of Infertility and Divorce

— Written by Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Kidney deficiency is a suppressible disease. What's more, it can turn into a yin fistula due to improper treatment. Many kidney deficiency patients, because this disease makes it difficult to fulfill their conjugal dreams and have no hope of reproduction, often do not get the opportunity for rapid treatment. They desperately choose medicine and buy aphrodisiacs, which is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Secondly, there are many weak endocrine agents on the market, which waste money and do not help the disease. Therefore, although they grow older, they still have no children. This is truly the most painful thing!

We doctors are very careful in treating such people. The first thing we must do is investigate the cause of the disease, which is caused by masturbation, injury, or excessive indulgence. As a result, the youth gland is unable to rejuvenate, forming a decline phenomenon, causing the blood produced physiologically to be in a state of exhaustion and failure. On the one hand, it cannot stimulate the sexual organs to make them erect, and on the other hand, it cannot promote the function of metabolism, affecting brainpower and physical strength. In addition, because the sperm in the testicles is scarce and fragile, even if there is a wife with healthy fertility, she is still unable to have children. Therefore, I solemnly advise infertile couples that if they want to have children to enjoy family happiness, they should practice abstinence at ordinary times to avoid wasting sperm, which is the best policy.

However, although this method is effective in application, if the husband suffering from the above-mentioned symptoms cannot be treated and cured, it will naturally be in vain!

Recently, in my hospital, I have been using the so-called testicular endocrine therapy, which is to use high-quality testicular essence preparations to supplement people with insufficient sexual power and weak reproduction. As a result, very satisfactory results have been obtained, but it is necessary to take panticome "Buti Kang," a renewal preparation made from pure essence extracted from chimpanzee testicles, to have a truly effective effect and never disappoint the takers. I once cured a couple who had been married for a long time without children, and the process has considerable medical research value, so I will describe it as follows:

The patient was a man with impotence and neurasthenia. After reasonable treatment, he took "Buti Kang" for three months, and the above symptoms were completely cured, but it was still difficult to conceive. Then, his wife was diagnosed, and it was found that although her menstruation was normal, her health level was low, resulting in a very short ovulation period, so in fact, there was very little chance of contact with sperm. Therefore, she was instructed to take "Buti Kang" for women, and as a result, her health improved, and she eventually gave birth to a son. This proves that no matter what the disease is, it is necessary to make a precise diagnosis!

### Progress in Treating the Lungs

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

There are many methods for treating lung disease, but there is no specific medicine that can cure it completely. Since ancient times, I don't know how many lung disease patients have been sacrificed under the saying that there is no specific medicine. It is very sad!

Recently, due to the development of science, medicine has made great strides, and the treatment of lung diseases has also made great progress. "Bufei Naier" is a medicine that was invented with the driving force of the imperial examination system. This agent has been tested by famous doctors in various countries and has proven to have the effect of short-term effectiveness for lung diseases in various stages. Because no matter what dangerous stage the lung disease has reached, taking "Bufei Naier" enables the patient to develop the ability to resist tuberculosis bacteria, and can gradually shrink the cavities in the lungs until they are as flat as usual. Therefore, this drug is promoted as the chief wine of internal medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis, which is indeed not an exaggeration.

### Cured Case of Many Years of Spermatorrhea

— Diagnosis by Physician Yao Juyan

The patient Zhao Jinrong, 23 years old, is from Xiajiang, Jiangxi. When he was 16 years old, he committed masturbation. Later, after reading the section of "Jiang Xingge Reunites with the Pearl Shirt" in "Ancient and Modern Wonders," he couldn't help but masturbate more and more intensely in the quiet of the night. After that, spermatorrhea followed, and the bad habit of masturbation could not be stopped. For more than three years, not only was his face pale and his spirit weak, but he also had the appearance of dripping sperm when seeing women during the day. Last autumn, he was ordered by his parents to marry. Every time he had sexual intercourse, he suffered from premature ejaculation and back pain, and the illness became worse and worse. He asked for treatment. I instructed him to abstain from the habit of masturbation, strictly observe health preservation, and temporarily abstain from sexual intercourse. He received electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day and was given a special medicine for spermatorrhea, "Nairis Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop spermatorrhea. He was also ordered to buy and take the German testicular endocrine agent "Buti Kang" for men to cultivate and replenish his losses and treat premature ejaculation. Zhao followed my words and actions. Half a month later, spermatorrhea was completely gone. A month later, there was no premature ejaculation, and his spirit was restored, and his back pain was also cured. Zhao, in view of the remarkable efficacy of the drug "Buti Kang," took it for three consecutive months. Now his health has been restored, his face is rosy, and his weight has increased by nine pounds (his weight at the time of diagnosis was only 102 pounds).

Modern Medicine

### Gonorrhea and Marital Happiness

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Gonorrhea and marital happiness have a great relationship, because everyone knows that gonorrhea is an extremely infectious disease. Therefore, if a married man is unfortunately infected with gonorrhea, it is best to sleep with his wife only after he is cured. Otherwise, if the wife is infected with this poison one day, it will be transmitted again and again, causing the wife's leucorrhea to drip, infiltrating the vagina, and causing abnormal stinging pain. On the one hand, it can also lead to infertility due to gonorrhea, causing a breakdown in the feelings between the two parties and doubling the pain. However, if it is not cured within a short period of time, it will be difficult for men to abstain from sex for a long time.

We don't need to condemn venereal disease patients with the words "morality." We are doctors, doctors who solve people's pain, and we should talk about some effective and practical treatments, and we should also investigate the social causes of venereal diseases.

From the statistics of various medical scholars, we know that gonorrhea patients account for the largest number of venereal disease patients. It turns out that gonorrhea is extremely difficult to cure. If ordinary over-the-counter drugs are mistakenly taken, the disease and the medicine will not be opposite, and the result will not only be useless but also harmful. If gonorrhea patients corrode their joints as a result, they become paralyzed and disabled. Because gonococci do not only stay on the local urethral mucosa, they are scattered in the deep tissues and blood in the body, so the treatment must be thorough. If a man suffers from gonorrhea, the testicles are first damaged. If a woman suffers from gonorrhea, the ovaries are immediately destroyed. Therefore, the vas deferens of men and the fallopian tubes of women are both inflamed and blocked, and they can never conceive.

In order to quickly eradicate this tragedy of future unhappiness for both sexes, you can take the German gonorrhea special drug "Kelinong." Because this agent is made of a mixture of protein pigments, it can produce a great effect of using cells to resist gonorrhea bacteriophages after taking it, so it is most appreciated by general gonorrhea patients. For all new and old leucorrhea, the above-mentioned effects will occur within a few hours after taking "Kelinong." Completely sweep away gonococci from flowing blood and other places. Men use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally and women use "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories, so that it can be cured in three weeks in acute gonorrhea and five weeks in the chronic period, and the effect of root cure will be achieved. If married couples suffer from gonorrhea at the same time, they can be treated at the same time to avoid transmission and achieve perfect results. This is my practical experience over the years.

New Gonorrhea Terms

Clinic on Ningbo Road, No. 9, Intersection of Sichuan Road

### Gonorrhea with Ants Biting in the Penis

Invasion of the Vas Deferens

The vas deferens holds great power over reproductive function. If there is no such organ, or if this organ is attacked by external bacteria, inflammation occurs in this lumen, and it swells and closes. Therefore, reproduction naturally falls into despair, and when gonorrhea patients develop vas deferens inflammation, there is always pain like an ant bite in the urethra, especially in the anus and perineum, where the swelling pain is like a split, urination is difficult, and after exerting effort, a small amount of urine is discharged, but there is also a lot of pus and blood mixed in. Lower abdominal pain also increases. At this time, if X-rays are used, it will definitely prove that the patient's vas deferens is swollen beyond constant. If you do not treat it promptly, you will of course lose its reproductive power.

Example of a Cured Case

Previously, there was a patient, Gong Xiaogong, 18 years old. Because he liked sports all his life, riding horses and wielding swords, he was known as a capable hand. After suffering from gonorrhea, in addition to having to take a little rest during the acute gonorrhea period, he resumed his old habits after the acute gonorrhea period. Gong's disease was caused by encountering an incompetent doctor during the acute gonorrhea period, and then being mistaken by inferior medicine, wasting more than a year, so he changed this disease. I used German static electricity therapy and X-rays alternately, and also used the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" as an internal medicine to concentrate its bactericidal effect on the lesions, so that within two weeks. The inflammation and swelling of the vas deferens has subsided, and after continuing the treatment for five weeks, this painful gonorrhea was completely cured! He married Ms. Wang Meiju last year, and their life is very harmonious.

### More than 40 Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Fishing Grounds in Zhoushan Islands; A Japanese Warship Leads and Protects Them; The Fish Catch is Transported to Shanghai for Sale

Since Japanese warships disturbed the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, Japanese fishing boats, protected by Japanese warships, took the opportunity to invade fishing in the Zhoushan Islands, and arbitrarily burned fishing boats and massacred fishermen. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has approved the establishment of an aquatic product transportation and sales office to make every effort to relieve the livelihoods of fishermen. Details are recorded as follows:

Eastern Zhejiang Fishermen Suffer Greatly

Hangzhou Bay, Ningbo Bay, Xiangshan Bay, Shipu Bay, Sanmen Bay, Taizhou Bay, Wenzhou Bay, and the Zhoushan Islands are the base of our country's fishing grounds. The fish produced are mainly large yellow croaker, small yellow croaker, cuttlefish, and hairtail, totaling 21,459 fishing boats. The annual catch is more than 97,230,000 yuan. The Shenjiamen area of the Zhoushan Islands is the gathering place for fishing boats. The fish caught are sold exclusively in Shanghai. After the war, Japanese warships were often found in the waters of eastern Zhejiang, arbitrarily burning fishing boats and massacring fishermen, so that the fishermen in the Zhoushan Islands did not dare to go out to sea to fish, and the fishing production was greatly affected as a result.

Japanese Fishing Boats Take the Opportunity to Invade Fishing

Japan has been deliberately infringing on our fishing rights for a long time. Japanese fishermen took advantage of the Japanese warships disturbing eastern Zhejiang, and with the Japanese government giving them various conveniences, they took the opportunity to invade fishing in the Zhoushan Islands. Today, in the waters off Changtu Island, Zhenzuimen, and Zhanggongmiao in Dinghai County, on the 25th of last month, a Japanese warship sailed from the southeast, followed by more than 40 Japanese fishing boats catching aquatic products, each flying a Japanese flag, and carried out fishing. By the 27th, they went to the Putuo waters to invade fishing. It is reported that since last month, Japanese fishing boats have been invading fishing in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang from time to time, and Japanese warships have been protecting them. These fishing boats are all of the latest type. The number of fish caught every day is quite large and they are all sold in Shanghai.

Establish a Transportation and Sales Office to Relieve Fishermen

The Zhejiang Wartime Product Adjustment Office approved the organization of the Ningbo Aquatic Product Transportation and Sales Office. The founding meeting was held at the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 am on the 28th of last month. At the same time, in order to divide the administrative powers of fisheries in various regions, the provincial government meeting approved that all fishery administrative matters in the future should be under the jurisdiction of the fishery administration offices in various regions. As for the functions of the fishermen's Baojia committees in various regions, they are to handle submitted resolutions and other matters to avoid difficulties in the promotion of work. In addition, funds are allocated to relieve unemployed fishermen and implement fishermen's land reclamation, etc., which have been implemented separately according to the original plan.

Cotton Cloth Weaving Industry Donation Payment Methods

The Cotton Cloth Industry and Weaving Industry Associations of this city held a joint meeting the other day to discuss promoting donations for refugees. It was stipulated that when businesses in both industries receive a certificate of origin for domestic goods, a refugee donation of one cent will be collected for each piece. Those who receive a certificate for zero pieces will be charged 5 cents for each piece of colored cloth and 3 cents for each piece of white cloth. The payment method is stipulated as follows: A. Those who receive a certificate of origin for domestic goods shall pay the attached refugee donation in full on the spot in addition to the handling fee, and the association will issue an official receipt (Shanghai Refugee Relief Association) to clear the procedures. B. Those who receive zero-piece certificates shall pay the refugee donation due according to the number of pieces listed in the general table, once every six months.

### Shocking News of the Death of a Pastor in Pingjiang; Churches in Shanghai are Extremely Shocked; Church Property is Marked with British Flags; It Seems That Japanese Aircraft Deliberately Bombed

The Continental Daily reported that the staff of the British American Methodist Church in Shanghai were quite shocked to hear the shocking news that Rev. Li was bombed to death by Japanese aircraft in Pingjiang on March 15. Yesterday (March 31), it was learned that the church has planned to inject Rev. Li's remains with medicine to prevent them from rotting. Although the general church has not yet received direct news from Pingjiang, Rev. Li's death has been confirmed by the responsible party and a protest has been lodged with the Japanese authorities by the British Foreign Office. Yesterday, it was learned from Shanghai that regarding the request for a rapid continuation of the bombing of church buildings, a request is currently being made to the Japanese side. The information received in Shanghai today fully confirms the previous news that church property was clearly marked with flags during the air raid. According to eyewitnesses of the attack, it seems that the Japanese aircraft deliberately bombed it. Li was standing in the place where the bomb landed.

Explosion

Li was bombed to death immediately. Another church worker, Clark, narrowly escaped death and fainted from the shock. It is impossible for Japanese pilots not to notice the flags, because the church buildings are magnificent and marked with huge British flags, and the ground is also painted with huge white letters.

### Hua Bei (North China) Japanese Puppet Regime Compiles Foreign Exchange, Foreign Merchants Lodge Protests, Will Report to Their Respective Governments

According to the French-language "Peiping (Beijing) Political News," since the "Provisional Government" banned the use of legal tender (Chinese currency), the control over foreign exchange has become increasingly stringent. All export goods must sell the foreign currency earned from exports to the Yokohama Specie Bank at the "statutory" exchange rate. However, Japanese merchants can sell their foreign exchange earnings at high prices in the open markets of Tianjin and Shanghai. As a result, foreign groups in Peiping and Tianjin have engaged in negotiations with the Japanese, protesting the unfair commercial treatment of Japanese and foreign nationals and demanding improvements. The Japanese side responded by asserting that all foreign exchange earned by Japanese merchants from exporting Chinese products also passes through Japanese banks to be converted into Japanese yen, and that the exchange rate of Japanese yen is aligned with the counterfeit currency of the "United Reserve Bank," so the gains of Japanese merchants are equal to those of other foreign nationals. However, it is reported that foreign merchants in Peiping and Tianjin are dissatisfied with the Japanese response and are planning to jointly submit further protests to their governments against Japan.

Pseudo "Fresh Pork Market" Determined Difficult to Realize

Japanese Merchants Seize Fresh Pork Business

Pork Industry Resolves to Not Participate

The pseudo "Fresh Pork Market" has been unable to establish due to opposition from pork merchants. Today, a certain Japanese firm is attempting to seize the fresh pork business by prohibiting foreign ships from loading at various ports in the Jiangbei production area, and buying and transporting fresh pork to Shanghai from Jiangbei. A few days ago, 600 head of fresh pork were shipped from Xingang (New Port), unloaded at the Yangshupu dock, and transported to markets in the Public and French Concessions for sale. The pork industry has already held a meeting to discuss countermeasures and decided to not participate in the pseudo "Fresh Pork Market." Therefore, no matter what, it will be difficult to realize.

Shanghai Refugee Shelter General Situation of Provisions

Total Number of People Exceeds 90,000

Savings Can Sustain for Three Months

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," there are now 55,000 Chinese refugees in the refugee camps of the Public and French Concessions. Another 40,000 refugees are being cared for by the Nanshi (South City) refugee area. Among these refugees, women account for 40%, and men and children each account for 30%. The monthly cost of provisions for refugees in the two concessions is 150,000 yuan, and the monthly cost of provisions for refugees in the Nanshi refugee area is 45,000 yuan. It is reported that the Nanshi refugee area can obtain about 45,000 yuan per month from charitable lottery tickets, which can be used for maintenance. Various refugee relief organizations in the city now have savings of 550,000 yuan, which can be used to maintain the refugee shelters for three months.

San Francisco Radio Station Broadcasting to the Far East

The "Continental Daily" reports that (yesterday, the 2nd) according to the US Commercial Counselor, the newly built radio station in Bao Island, San Francisco, with the call sign WCXBE, began regular broadcasts directly to the East on Tuesday. Its frequency is 9.530 (31.48 meters), broadcasting music, world news reports (Shanghai time from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM), and other programs from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM Shanghai time. The radio station is currently in its initial phase, and it is hoped that it will broadcast more specialized programs to the East in the future.

American Senior Financial Advisor Visits Shanghai

Talks about "Outbreak of Far East Events"

Like "Key to World Events"

Mr. Esson M. Gale, Senior Financial Advisor to the American High Commissioner to the Philippines, stated to the American press while in the Philippines that "the key to world events can be found in the Far East." It is learned that Mr. Gale arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines on April 1 aboard the President Coolidge. Shortly after arriving in port, Mr. Gale visited the American Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss. According to Mr. Gauss, he does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long and will soon visit the Shanghai war zone and tour major stores in the area. Before Mr. Gale came to Shanghai, he stated in a newspaper in San Francisco that "after the turbulent movements of the world stage, various things in the Far East, one part is calm, and another part is turning to high-speed changes." He also said, "The outbreak of events in the Far East is like the key to world events." Mr. Gale and his wife may leave Shanghai on the same ship after arriving in Shanghai.

### Our Country Issues Stamps to Commemorate American Democracy, Printed with Portraits of President Sun and Washington, Full Set of Four Types Issued on the 15th of This Month

March 4th of this year is the anniversary of the founding of the Congress of the United States of America. The United States Constitution was created in 1787, so since 1937, democratic countries around the world, such as France, Russia, Spain, and various American countries, have successively issued commemorative stamps to celebrate. Recently, reporters inquired at the post office and learned that our country's commemorative stamps for the 150th anniversary of the American Constitution, which had been ordered from the United States for a long time, arrived in late last month and are now scheduled to be issued from April 15th. It is heard that the design of the stamps is a portrait of President Sun and Washington, lined with the Chinese and American flags. The full set of stamps has four types, totaling five cents, twenty-five cents, fifty cents, and one yuan, with a total face value of one yuan and eighty cents. It is also heard that only 1.5 million sets will be issued, and Americans have already pre-ordered nearly hundreds of thousands of sets, so stamp collectors consider these stamps to be quite valuable.

### Kong Xiangxi Encourages Research on Insect Control Methods, Aphids Are Most Damaging, Annual Loss of 100 Million Yuan, Commends Wu Zhenzhong for Research and Invention of Control Agents

Aphids are a major pest in our country's agricultural products, causing the most severe damage to cotton, vegetables, fruit trees, tobacco, etc. It is estimated that the national losses are over 100 million yuan each year. The former Central Cotton Improvement Institute sent Wu Zhenzhong to research control methods. After hundreds of experiments and repeated research in the most severely affected areas, he successively invented inexpensive pest control agents, one called cottonseed oil emulsion and the other called cottonseed oil soap. The control methods were inexpensive and highly effective. Once promoted, farmers rushed to imitate them. At that time, within a period of one month, they were promoted in more than 140 villages, controlling 15,000 mu of cotton fields, increasing income by ten yuan per mu. The following year, the control of cotton fields was expanded to 620,000 mu, increasing income by 6 million yuan. If cotton, vegetables, fruit trees, tobacco, etc., throughout the country are universally controlled, the income can be increased by more than 100 million yuan. After the Anti-Japanese War, the agency was abolished, causing Wu's research work to fall short of success. It is learned that Premier Kong Xiangxi believes that this kind of research is beneficial to agriculture and that it is a pity to abandon it halfway. He has already summoned Wu to inquire about everything, which is very commendable. Wu has been specially assigned to work in the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee to continue researching aphid control methods to achieve complete success, contribute to the country, and benefit the people.

Tian Yao Qiao Opening the Dam Pros and Cons

Tang Puzhuang Writes to the French Municipal Council

Harmful to Drinking Water of Residents of Puhuitang

The French Municipal Council is dredging the Zhaojiabang River, which borders the Chinese and French areas, due to siltation, in order to facilitate water transport. However, it is heard that there is a plan to excavate the dam foundation of Tian Yao Qiao (Tian Yao Bridge). If this is true, the polluted water of the Zhaojiabang River will inevitably flow westward, and the health and drinking water of hundreds of thousands of residents on both sides of the Puhuitang River will be harmed, causing panic. Therefore, Mr. Tang Puzhuang, the former member of the Puhuitang dredging promotion committee, was appointed to write to the French authorities to stop it. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Sirs, Recently, your council has been working to dredge the Zhaojiabang River, which is silted up, to facilitate shipping. I greatly appreciate your concern for water conservancy. However, I have heard that there is a plan to excavate the dam foundation of Tian Yao Qiao, and I do not know if this is true. The construction of this dam is related to the rivers on both sides of Puhuitang River, such as Xiaozha, Hongqiao, west to Qibao Sijing, and diversion to Caohjing Laofenshan and other villages and towns for residents' sanitary water. If it is excavated, the sewage east of the dam will inevitably be discharged, and Puhuitang will be the final drainage point, harming the daily drinking water of hundreds of thousands of residents. The matter is of great importance. Therefore, when Puhuitang was dredged a few years ago, the local people fought to the death to build the dam to prevent the river water from being polluted (the committee built a pavilion and erected a monument on the west side of the Zhongshan Road Bridge, which can be verified). If your council excavates it, the disputes of the past will inevitably be repeated today. The appeal to dredge Puhuitang took more than ten years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, which was not easy. Residents regard it as a source of life, and how can they easily destroy it and go against public opinion? I, Puzhuang, participated in the dredging of Puhuitang River in the past, and I cannot sit idly by and watch the previous achievements be abandoned. Even if the excavation plan is heard from hearsay and may not be true, in order to prevent problems before they occur, I have to write to your council to ask you to handle it carefully to benefit the people. I am most eager to pray for this. Sincerely, Tang Puzhuang, former member of the Puhuitang River Dredging Promotion Committee, to the French Municipal Council."

### Shanghai Dance Hall Dancer Chuan Liyan Attempts Suicide, Love Triangle with Fan Shaochun, Fainted in the Dance Floor After Taking Poison

Dancer Chuan Liyan, 19 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, is currently earning a living by dancing at the Dahai Dance Hall near Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse. Her older sister is Fu Lijuan, who was once a very popular dancer and as famous as Wang Xiaomei. The two sisters are currently living together at 46 Tongchun Lane, Baker Road. Because of her older sister's fame, Chuan Liyan attracts many wealthy young men who compete to serve her. Among them is a young man named Fan Shaochun, who is even more enamored with her, and dances with Chuan every night without fail. Chuan also sees that Fan is young and handsome and seems to be wealthy, so they gradually become close, and their feelings are not shallow. Unexpectedly, last night around 11:00 PM, after Fan Shaochun stepped into the Dahai Dance Hall, he suddenly changed his usual style and danced with other women. This made Chuan angry and upset, and she fainted in the dance floor. At that time, there was a performance in the hall, and people were surprised to see this. They called her but she was unconscious. So Fan Shaochun was also very anxious and quickly sent Chuan home, but seeing that her expression was different, he knew that she had taken poison, so he transferred her to Baolong Hospital. Dr. Luo examined her and ordered her to be hospitalized to observe whether the symptoms changed. The Xinzha police station received the news and sent a Chinese detective to investigate. As for the inside story, it is said that there are other things involved, and her mother's opposition to her dating Fan is also a reason. As for Fan Shaochun, he is well known in various dance halls, and people often call him Little Fan.

### Dockyard Hoodlums Take Advantage to Extort Passengers, This Trend Has Become More Rampant Lately, Passengers Suffer Greatly

Although Shanghai is currently an isolated island, the concession areas are still relatively safe on the surface. Therefore, people from the surrounding war zones and guerrilla zones in the interior are still flocking to this isolated island one after another, hoping to live in peace. As a result, the passengers arriving at the port on foreign and inland river steamers are very crowded. Originally, there was a kind of dockyard hoodlums who stayed there all day long, and when they saw passengers disembarking, they took the opportunity to extort them. The methods used varied from person to person and had no rules. Business travelers suffered greatly from these hoodlums. Lately, this kind of

Extortion Trend

has become more rampant. In addition to losing money, passengers' suitcases and bedding are often snatched away. A month ago, a Ms. Guo went to Haimen, Zhejiang Province, to visit her brother. When she returned, the suitcase filled with clothes she was carrying disappeared the moment she disembarked and hired a car, resulting in a loss of hundreds of gold. Although she searched repeatedly, there was no trace. At the end of last month, Ji Youshun from Zhenjiang also wanted to go to Wuhu on business. At the 6th Bund Pier, he encountered

These Hoodlums

In addition to being defrauded of a boat ticket to Wuhu, the luggage he was carrying was also taken away. After Ji's hometown was occupied, his family was scattered, and he drifted on the sea, working as a servant at Mao Jinji on Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, his brother in Wuhu visited him and sent a letter inviting him to reunite. Therefore, Ji bought a boat ticket on the 31st and took his luggage to the 6th pier to wait for the boat. Suddenly, a man named Shi Yunfeng saw that Ji looked like a villager and approached him, claiming to be from the same hometown as Ji and running a cigarette paper shop in Wuhu. He was also going to Wuhu to buy goods. Since they were from the same hometown and were going to the same place, they could

Travel Together

To avoid loneliness on the journey and take care of each other. Ji was a young man who had little experience of the world, so he was captured and regarded as a good companion. The man also learned that Ji had bought a boat ticket, so he first used the trick of defrauding the ticket, saying that Ji had spent too much on the ticket price. He had an acquaintance in the shipping company and could return the ticket and buy a half ticket. When he spoke, he asked a man in his forties to go with Ji to the shipping company on Hankou Road to return the ticket. Ji's belongings were placed on a cargo box on the pier, saying that these were all the goods he was transporting and he could take care of them. Later, Ji handed the boat ticket to the man who went with him and went to a certain

In Front of the Building

The man told Ji to wait outside the door while he went inside to return the ticket. Unexpectedly, from noon to evening, the man did not come out again. He had already defrauded the boat ticket and escaped through the side door. When Ji returned to the pier, all his luggage was also gone. While he was in a panic, he saw Shi Yunfeng wandering nearby. He argued with him and demanded his belongings, but Shi turned his eyes and pretended not to know him, and pointed out that Ji was a gangster and called his accomplices to beat Ji. The patrolling police arrived and took both Ji and Shi to the general patrol station and sent detectives to find out that Shi Yunfeng usually

Extorted at the Pier

So he was detained. However, all of Ji's luggage and boat ticket are still missing. On Saturday morning, the police escorted the suspect to the First Special District Local Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and asked for severe punishment. Judge Dai interrogated them carefully and sentenced Shi Yunfeng to six months in prison. There are many similar behaviors like Shi's in the dockyards. If the victims can report them one by one like Ji, then these people can be restrained and cause less harm.

Possessing Opium and Smoking Paraphernalia

Woman Fined

Yisheng Rubber Factory was founded by Hong Liansheng from Ningbo, producing Arrow Drum brand galoshes. Yishengchang General Distribution Office was set up at 52 Xingsheng Street, French Concession. After the outbreak of the war, Hong's family also moved to the upper floor of the distribution office. Hong has an opium addiction and has smoking paraphernalia at home. Recently, the French police received a secret report that Hong was privately selling opium and selling it secretly. Therefore, the police sent Chinese and Western detectives to search the address a few days ago. Fifty packs of opium, one tael each, and a set of smoking paraphernalia were found in Hong's room. The opium pipe was made of rhinoceros bone and was quite expensive. Hong happened to be away at the time, so his wife, Hong Su, was taken to the police station along with the opium and smoking paraphernalia for investigation. Hong went around looking for people to rescue her, and the police took her statement that the opium was for her husband's own smoking and that he had bought it before, etc. The next day, she was sent to the Special First Court, where the lawyer of the French Concession Administration sued her for possessing opium and smoking paraphernalia. After Judge Qiu Huanying interrogated her in the Eighth Criminal Court, he announced the conclusion and sentenced Hong Su to a fine of 300 yuan and confiscated the opium and smoking paraphernalia. After the defendant was sentenced, she paid the fine and regained her freedom.

Refugees Ju Peiyuan and His Wife

Sued for Abduction Not Guilty

Injustice Can Be Exonerated

Ju Peiyuan, a native of Suzhou, and his wife, Xia, who used to live on Baoshan Road in Zhabei, took refuge in the Public Concession after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident and became beggars in the Xiamen Road area, sleeping in the alleys. Recently, they were suspected of abducting the eleven-year-old daughter, Xiudi, of Wu Changyao, a peddler from Ningbo who lived on Beishan West Road. The girl's father found out and reported it to the police, who took them to the Laozha Police Station along with the ten-year-old child, Ju Jiaqi, and transferred them to the Huisi Police Station and sent them to the First Special District Court. The two defendants stated that the boy, Ju Jiaqi, was born to Xia, and Ju Peiyuan used to be a bookkeeper at the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, which could be investigated. They were not abductors. It was ordered that Wu's daughter be returned to her father, and Ju's child was temporarily sent to the Labor Bureau Children's Education Center for care. The two defendants were detained. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the police sent detectives to the Commercial Press during the adjournment and found that Ju Peiyuan did work at the bookstore in 1923, but did not mention that he had a wife and children. He asked the court for a free opinion. Ju Peiyuan stated that the child, Jiaqi, was not born at that time, so he did not report it. Judge Huang carefully examined the child and found that the child's face looked like the mother and the eyes looked like the father. He also asked Ju's child if he wanted to go back with his parents or study at the Children's Education Center. The child said that he wanted to return with the two defendants, so Judge Huang ruled that Ju Peiyuan and Xia were not guilty and released them in court. Ju's child was taken back by his father.

Now the house has been reoccupied by Westerners.

### A Pair of Elderly Couple Dies by Suicide After Consuming Poison Due to Financial Strain from Gambling and Unwillingness to Compromise Integrity

Jing Jiaxun from Nanxun, aged 46, formerly worked at the Salt Affairs Bureau. He is currently unemployed and lives with his wife in apartment number 9, at number 121, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. With nothing to do on weekdays, the elderly couple often frequented gambling dens in western Shanghai. However, they consistently lost. The night before last, they took two thousand yuan with them to a certain gambling den, making a final desperate bet, but unexpectedly lost everything. Overwhelmed with grief and anger, they decided to commit suicide after returning home, both consuming a certain poisonous liquid. The next morning, around 10 a.m., the servant employed in the apartment entered the room to clean and discovered Jing's wife groaning in bed, her expression drastically changed. Jing Jiaxun had already died. The servant immediately reported this to the accounting room, which in turn reported it to the police. Detectives were dispatched to the scene for investigation. Two empty bottles of poisonous liquid were found on the table, along with four suicide notes prepared in advance. Two of the notes were addressed to his nephew, and their content roughly stated that "someone from a certain quarter repeatedly urged him to take a false position, but even though he was in dire financial straits, he was determined not to sell his soul, preferring to commit suicide." Jing's wife was rushed to Renji Hospital by detectives for treatment, but due to the excessive amount of poison ingested, she died at approximately 10:15 p.m. last night.

Zhu Xuexi, a 19-year-old youth from Changzhou residing at number 1, Xixiang Lane, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, was walking alone near the southern end of Gu'en Temple on Vermont Road, near the Wusong River intersection, at 6 p.m. on the 29th of last month. He saw Tang Caiming (age 31), a Chongming native, performing magic tricks and selling his skills near the foot of the foreign cemetery wall. He had hung a picture on the wall, specifically

teaching various magic trick

techniques. Zhu, driven by curiosity, approached to watch. Tang Caiming immediately engaged Zhu in conversation, saying, "I see that your complexion is ruddy and your fortune is about to bloom. If you want to make a fortune, I have a peach wood figure that can turn one into ten. If you give me one yuan in legal tender, it can be turned into ten yuan." Zhu was moved by this and immediately took out his wallet to check. He had a total of eight yuan and two jiao in legal tender, which he handed over to Tang to transform. After receiving the money, Tang put it into a red cloth bag he had prepared and, while

muttering incantations

, wrapped the bag and handed it to Zhu, instructing him to take it home and open it, at which point it would have turned into eighty-two yuan in legal tender. However, he instructed Zhu not to open or look into it midway. Zhu accepted the bag, carefully hid it on his person, and happily returned home. After taking out the red cloth bag and inspecting it, he found that the bag contained only folded old newspapers and no legal tender whatsoever.

Realizing he had been swindled

, he reported it to the French police station, who dispatched detectives to accompany him to the original location, where they apprehended Tang and brought him back to the police station. Under interrogation, he confessed that he also had a master and that he was only an apprentice, having been learning for only three days. The plaintiff came and asked to be taught a complete set of "spontaneous magic tricks," for which he charged one jiao. He denied having received eight yuan and two jiao with the promise to turn it into eighty-two yuan. The case was

transferred to the Special District Court No. 2

Criminal Division 8, where the lawyer Fei Xizhen from the French Concession Administration charged him with obtaining money by fraud and explained the details of the case. The defendant maintained his previous statement, but the plaintiff recounted the experience of being defrauded in vivid detail. Judge Jiang Liquan reviewed the statements and, considering the case required further investigation, adjourned the hearing for seven days. The defendant was detained.

### Dispute Over Guardianship of Qiu Weiqing's Children: Family Meeting Requests Hu Weiyun to Act as Guardian; Hu Files Lawsuit with the Court for Confirmation

Qiu Weiqing, a major paint merchant, profited greatly during the European War and built a Western-style house at the corner of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road in this city. Qiu's first wife did not bear any children, so they adopted a son named Changsheng, who is now in his thirties. Qiu felt that the adopted son was not his own flesh and blood, so he took the younger sister of Jia Yaochen from Yangzhou as a concubine. Jia gave birth to a daughter on May 17, 1921, named Shuying (who is not yet eighteen years old this year), and a son the following year, named Changyin (who is not yet seventeen years old this year). Qiu

died of illness

around 1925, leaving behind an estate of over five million, which was managed by his concubine Qiu Jia and others. In 1932, Jia also died of illness, leaving a will designating Chang Shuliu, the tutor she hired for the family, as the guardian of Qiu Shuying and Qiu Changyin. Their estate was jointly managed by Ren Jian'an, an old shop employee hired by Qiu Weiqing before his death, and Qiu Changsheng. Chang Shuliu passed away due to illness on November 27 of last year. Qiu Changyin and Qiu Shuying

are both underage.

Since Chang Shuliu's death, because there was no one in the order listed in Article 1094, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the Civil Code to act as guardian, Jia Yaochen, uncle of Qiu Changyin, Zhu Henian, cousin, Zhou Shuqing, paternal cousin, Xi Qiu Lianzhu, paternal aunt, and Bian Zhu Hezheng, maternal aunt, held a family meeting on January 4 of this year. Zhu Henian, Bian Zhu Hezheng, Jia Yaochen and others decided to hire Hu Weiyun, younger brother of the late banking tycoon Hu Bijiang, to succeed as the guardian of Qiu Changyin and Qiu Shuying. Zhu Henian and others

based on the Civil Code

Article 1094, Paragraph 5 decision, and hired lawyer Zhang Danping as a consultant. When Hu Weiyun, hired as the guardian of Qiu Changyin and Qiu Shuying, went to the Qiu residence to exercise his guardianship, he was refused by Qian Jian'an, Qiu Changsheng, Chang Xiaosong (son of the late Chang Shuliu), and others. At the same time, Wang Jian'an's father applied to the First Special Court for the designation of Qiu Changsheng as the successor guardian, even though the

ruling was approved

, Zhu Henian and others have filed an appeal according to the law. Hu Weiyun recently hired lawyer Wu Qilun and others to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, accusing Ren Jian'an, Qiu Changsheng, Chang Xiaosong and others, requesting confirmation that he is the guardian of Qiu Changyin and Qiu Shuying. The court accepted the case. The court, based on the complaint, summoned Jia Yaochen and others as witnesses for questioning. After a brief hearing, the court deemed it necessary to investigate the case further and adjourned the hearing to a later date.

After the Longhua Shanghai Cement Factory was managed by the German firm Zencher Foreign Firm, the Japanese army handed over the factory to Mitsui Foreign Firm, which transported all of the factory's inventory, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan, and sold it under the trademark of the domestic Elephant brand.

After investigation, the allegations were found to be true. The day before yesterday morning, Judge Zhu Chuzhe sentenced the defendants Huang Jingqing, Xu Zhengde, and Meng Yiming to a fine of one hundred yuan each for receiving stolen goods, and to perform labor, with two yuan equivalent to one day.

Li Wangu, a Sichuan woman residing at No. 15, Lane 17, Luban Road in the French Concession, has a fifteen-year-old daughter, Huifen, who works as a "little sister" at the Qunyu Lane Chanjuan brothel. Luo A'san, a Ningbo woman, aged 25, is currently operating a Ningbo brothel at No. 333 Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road. She hires Yong Yang, a Yongbo woman, as an employee. Luo is familiar with Li Huifen and knows that she is still "unopened," so she intends to find customers for her "first night." A waiter with the nickname "Long-Legged Lao Si" (also known as "Glass Cup"), learns about it and introduces her to a man with the surname Shen, specifying a fee of 250 yuan. On the night of the 28th of last month, Shen rented a room at No. 331 Shenzhou Hotel, and Huifen's virginity was lost.

Mass Weekly, No. 8, Special Children's Day Edition
— Chen Qin Title

### Preface

— Chen Heqin

April 4th is our Republic of China's Children's Day. The state's establishment of Children's Day has great significance, which we should deeply recognize and vigorously promote. We must ensure that the commemoration of Children's Day spreads throughout the country, so that all children across the nation can happily celebrate this festival, understand their responsibilities and missions in human history, strive diligently, transform the current society, and build a new country.

Today's children are the future masters of the country. As the ancients said, "The younger generation is to be regarded with respect," and as Western philosophers have also said, "The progress of national civilization follows in the footsteps of children." These statements all illustrate that children are the treasures of the country, the life of the nation, and the cornerstone of civilization. We have boundless hope for modern children.

When celebrating Children's Day, we must ensure that all children—both the fortunate and the unfortunate—receive happiness. As for so-called fortunate children, when we examine the happiness they receive, there may still be many areas where they are not happy. From a family perspective, the family environment should be as educational as possible, breaking the habit of children being pampered and cultivating in them the habits of autonomous learning, autonomous research, and participation in household chores such as cooking, washing clothes, and sweeping.

From a school perspective, dead book knowledge is not enough. Respected teachers should always consider the children's needs and supplement with more living materials. Stale teaching methods can be made more lively, avoiding the method of indoctrination and adopting methods of discussion and research, allowing children to breathe more freely.

When celebrating Children's Day, just discussing so-called fortunate children is not enough; teachers and parents should pay attention to and study the true happiness of children. As for the tens of thousands of unfortunate children, we must use all our strength to make them happy. We should encourage children to help children and mobilize adults to help children. To seek happiness for unfortunate children, more children's services should be established, such as promoting education for refugee children, establishing schools for newsboys, establishing orphanages for beggar children, organizing committees for the protection of child laborers, establishing apprentice schools, and establishing juvenile courts. These are all concrete efforts to seek happiness for unfortunate children. In addition to temporary celebratory activities, the preparatory committee also plans to undertake several permanent projects as a commemoration, hoping that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will come forward to support them. Then children will be happy, the country will prosper, and the nation will be glorious; truly, our future relies on it.

### From Children's Day to the Importance of Refugee Children's Education

— Chen Jicheng

This is the eighth Children's Day celebration in our country.

The significance of Children's Day lies not only in stimulating children's interest and inspiring in them a love for the community, the country, and the family, but also in arousing society's attention to children's affairs. Children's affairs include peacetime measures such as children's health care, entertainment, prevention of abuse, education for special children, and the handling of homeless children. We must carefully plan and vigorously promote these. Now, with the country in peril and homes destroyed, and with refugee children congregating in the isolated island of Shanghai numbering over one hundred thousand, their education and care must still be comprehensively planned and decisively implemented. If they step outside the restricted zone, everywhere they go, everything they see, children as young as five feet tall are unable to attend school. If the war does not stop for a single day, these children will not be able to receive education for a single day. Year after year, in the blink of an eye, they will be past school age, and this throng of ignoramuses will become the backbone of society. It is lamentable to think of! As for children in remote and barren areas, they not only lose the opportunity to attend school, but also lack care. Their lives cannot be guaranteed, let alone education. Yet, children's affairs are nation-building affairs. To build a sound nation, we must have sound citizens; to have sound citizens, we must first cultivate sound children. Therefore, rescuing refugee children is more important than rescuing refugees, and educating refugee children is even more important than rescuing refugees. In Western countries, those engaged in education all devote themselves to the education of orphans and impoverished children. For example, in France, Mr. and Mrs. Beraud and their adopted daughter Louise Blanc established a rural nursery; in Switzerland, Pestalozzi established an orphanage; in England, Barto in Weiss established a nursery in Ballana, Scotland, to educate the children of local workers; in Germany, Froebel was hired by the Swiss government as the head of the Boulderford Orphanage; and in Italy, Montessori served as the supervisor of the poor children's school initiated by the Charity Group of Rome. All these are clearly visible to everyone. Among them, Pestalozzi, witnessing the devastation caused by military disasters in Starkey, with too many orphans wandering about, rented a temple to house more than eighty affected children and provide them with orphan education. Although he faced repeated difficulties due to the orphans' diseases, bad habits, inadequate school buildings, and external misunderstandings, he was able to move people with his pure love and spirit of sacrifice. In less than half a year, he achieved the greatest results. This can serve as an excellent model for us to carry out refugee children's education. In ancient times in our country, King Goujian of Yue spent ten years accumulating resources and ten years teaching his people. Fichte in Germany advocated revival, and Germany first started with cultivating excellent national seeds. The importance of refugee children's education can be deeply considered!

Shanghai's Eighth Children's Day Celebration – Meritorious Participation in Transformation

### A Respectful Message to the Fathers, Brothers, and Teachers of Children on Children's Day

— Wu Zhiqian

As we celebrate the eighth Children's Day, looking around our country, the landscape has changed and the scenery is no longer the same. I cannot restrain my tears at the New Pavilion. Yet, the children in whom our nation's destiny and greatest hope are invested are spending their most valuable childhood holiday amid the continuous sound of gunfire. This is truly a most gratifying event. Even if I wanted to remain silent, how could I?

I believe that in these extraordinary times, what we expect of children is even more urgent than in ordinary times. The exhortations of fathers and brothers to their children, and the enlightenments of teachers to their students, should also be more important than in ordinary times. This is why I must offer a respectful message to the fathers, brothers, and teachers of children on this auspicious occasion.

What I want to tell the fathers and brothers of children is that family education should advance simultaneously with school education. Fathers and brothers should not think that they have fulfilled their responsibility by sending their children to school. They should teach them various etiquettes in the home, such as actions, advances and retreats, and manners of speech, and should provide concrete guidance on how to treat others, so as to cultivate their excellent character. The so-called "entering the home with filial piety and leaving with brotherly love" was originally the great path for ancient sages to teach people how to establish themselves, but today's children mostly regard it as stale and rotten words. There are few who follow it. This is what fathers and brothers should urgently clarify and guide.

What I want to tell the teachers of children is that children enter schools to seek knowledge and wisdom. In addition to imparting knowledge from textbooks, teachers should also observe the general situation and examine the national conditions, so that children fully understand the country's position and the international situation, in order to inspire their patriotism. They must also strengthen their physique and cultivate a martial spirit, so that they can be used to defend the country in the future. This is the responsibility that teachers should have.

Next, I want to tell the children themselves. It is no accident that you were born in this great era. During your years of study, you should first focus on your studies to enrich your knowledge, and second, focus on your physical condition to achieve physical health. After you complete your studies in the future, you can take on the country's affairs and make our country proud. You must know that the humiliation and great shame that our country has suffered for decades are waiting for you to wash away. The mission you bear is great, and you must work hard to encourage yourselves, so as not to fail to live in this great era.

I am happy to celebrate this auspicious festival, and I have nothing to wish for except to list three points to encourage each other. If you think it is a cliché, then how dare I?

### Children's Toys and Children's Education

— Shao Mingjiu

Children are the foundation of a nation. If we want the nation to be excellent, strong, and prosperous, we must first cultivate excellent and healthy children.

Child-centered education has only been advocated in China in recent years, and children have only begun to be noticed by people. Therefore, in education, the principle of implementation is to adapt to children's interests and needs. In terms of bookstores, children's libraries and young children's libraries are published. In terms of newspapers, there are children's education news and children's pictorials. In terms of society, there are organizations such as the Child Welfare Association, the Shanghai Children's Care Association, and the China Children's Products Company. Children's Day and Children's Year are also stipulated to show solemn advocacy. For the sake of our nation's future and our children's happiness, this is truly something worth celebrating.

Anyone who studies children's education knows that children's nature is to love games, so education should also be implemented from children's games. And the tools used in games are children's toys. Therefore, children's toys indirectly become tools for the implementation of children's education. Not only is this the case in theory, but also in the expression of facts, it proves that toys occupy a large force in children's education.

Since children's toys are so important in children's education, how should we pay attention to children's toys? I believe that in a negative way, we must actively try our best to ban inferior children's toys, because the influence of inferior toys on children is greater than the influence of inferior books on children. The reason is that toys are easy to generate interest, so the impression given to children is more profound than the impression obtained from books. As for the methods of banning, we must work together from the three aspects of family, school, and society to achieve results.

(1) Family Aspect

Because children spend the longest time in the family, they naturally play more. If there is nothing to provide them with games, it will inevitably make the children dry and tasteless all day long, or make them restless everywhere. However, if they are not selective, they are easily exposed to bad habits when they encounter inferior toys. For example, some families often use gambling tools for children to play. The influence of this kind of gambling toys on children is extremely profound, and even if you want to correct it with the power of education in the future, it is difficult to have a greater effect. It should be absolutely forbidden to approach children.

(2) School Aspect

School is the second family of children. Children spend most of their time in school other than in the family. Of course, I believe that the children's toys equipped in each school will definitely not have anything bad, but some schools are often brought by children themselves because of the simple equipment or too many students and it is not easy to manage some bad toys to play in school, or find some toys themselves, for unconscious games. People who are responsible for children's education should pay special attention to this place.

(3) Social Aspect

In addition to family and school activities, children sometimes come into contact with the social environment. There are countless games or toys in society that are specially designed to attract children. Children are often agitated by curiosity and will naturally approach him. For example, games such as turning colorful cards and rolling dice on small street stalls not only target children for profit, but also give children all kinds of bad influences and develop all kinds of bad habits. This kind of toys and games should be effectively banned. The joint force depends on the educational administrative authorities.

In short, all game tools that consume money and time and have no benefit to children's physical and mental health should be banned, and at the same time, we must actively promote toys that can inspire national thought, are beneficial to social construction, and meet the physical and mental development of children. In order to establish a good and healthy foundation for the nation, the methods can also be promoted and implemented by the three aspects of family, school, and society. If you want to do your job well, you must first sharpen your tools. May those who care about children's education pay attention to this.

### Overview of Shanghai Child Welfare Undertakings

— Chen Zhengfan

(1) Shanghai Municipal Council Child Protection Section

The Shanghai Municipal Council Child Protection Section was established in December 1938, and was managed by Ms. Fleanor M. Hinder; assistants were Mr. G.S. Hall and other social service personnel with rich experience in social investigation and handling of individual cases. The purpose of the establishment of the section is to provide appropriate and rapid protection for children and adolescents who are adopted by non-direct relatives and are abused and exploited. In addition to protecting general children, the section chief paid maximum attention to the issue of protecting maids. The Municipal Council Board of Directors passed two principles of protection: (1) The Bureau should, in accordance with the gradually developing concept in other places, not recognize the status of maids or any similar slave status. (This principle contains the meaning that maids should not be registered separately.) (2) The Bureau should also, as other places pay serious attention to, use all possible methods to ensure that the transfer of children and adolescents is reported to the Bureau's responsible personnel, and try to protect the transferees, so as to show the Bureau's sense of responsibility.

The Child Protection Section is related to all child welfare institutions in Shanghai and maintains close contact. For children issued by the court to various child welfare institutions, each child welfare institution should fill out a report every month and send it to the Child Protection Section for reference. Unless discussed with and agreed by the Child Protection Section, no child welfare institution may send court-issued children to factories, or allow people to adopt them, or choose a spouse for them, or dispose of them in other ways.

(2) Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association

The China Child Welfare Association aims to promote national children's welfare; after the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, in order to facilitate relief work, the general association moved to Chongqing, and an office was set up in Shanghai (address: No. 208, Central China Building, Edward Road). The persons in charge of the office are Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Weide, etc. All its affairs are divided into relief, protection, health, education, etc. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the office rescued a total of 1,857 children; in addition to those who were placed, there were still 895 children left, who are still being continuously taken in. In addition, it also handled cases of child abuse, treated children's diseases, and held health competitions.

There are many child welfare institutions in Shanghai, and they lack opportunities for recognition and contact with each other. As far as the author knows, the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association has sent personnel to study the issue, hoping to find the most appropriate solution.

(3) Shanghai Children's Welfare Association

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association was established on June 6, 27th year of the Republic of China. The directors are Chen Heqin, Chen Jicheng, and Huang Dinghui, etc., and the persons in charge are Wu Zhiqian, Zhao Yiwei, and Shao Mingjiu, etc. Its purpose: "Adopt the most economical, fastest, and most sustainable method to strive to protect children and cultivate healthy citizens of the Republic of China." All work is divided into five items: (1) Studying children's welfare undertakings, (2) Holding children's welfare undertakings, (3) Contacting or assisting children's welfare agencies and groups, (4) Cultivating children's welfare talents, (5) Editing children's welfare materials.

Since its establishment, the Children's Welfare Association has established 14 schools for newsboys, educating more than 600 newsboys. The newsboy schools plan to establish another 10 schools, so that all newsboys in the city can enjoy educational opportunities. In addition, it is also preparing to organize a committee for the protection of child laborers, to assist factories in improving the lives of child laborers, to promote child labor education, to establish orphanages for beggar children, to accommodate beggar children in the city, and to provide them with educational opportunities and production training.

### China Has No "Anti-Foreign Movement"

— Mao Lie

At least for now, China has no anti-foreign movement, only a resistance movement against the enemy. For any foreign country that treats us as a friendly nation, we also treat it as a friendly nation, and we welcome it with open arms. There is absolutely no reason to exclude it. If it is a foreign country that intends to invade us, or is invading us, then we will certainly resist to the death, not only excluding it!

According to recent reports from mainland newspapers and general inland sources, many Chinese newspapers are actually expressing Chinese people's xenophobia, allowing anti-British sentiments, and there are also all kinds of slogans and leaflets, and the situation seems very enthusiastic. This kind of farce, not to mention discerning people, even three-foot-tall children, know its source, isn't it the ghost of our enemy? Once it's said, it's really not worth laughing at!

Therefore, I hope that our friendly nations, including Britain, will not believe that China is anti-foreign. This is just our enemy, using the method of borrowing popular opinion, to put pressure on their puppets to play out a trick. And these puppets, who have already cut themselves off from their compatriots, do not count as Chinese people, let alone represent China.

At the same time, I hope that our compatriots in the guerrilla areas will clearly recognize the difference between friends and enemies. They will not be deceived by the enemy's small favors and treat the enemy as a friend, nor will they be influenced by the enemy's poisonous propaganda and treat a friend as an enemy. In short, those who help us are our friends, and those who invade us are our enemies. As for what is assistance and what is invasion, there are many facts before our eyes, which can be proven everywhere, so I don't need to explain it further.

Seeing this kind of enemy's trick will naturally make us know the enemy's intention. They want to drive out all foreigners in China, so that they can monopolize it to their heart's content, which is of course their due purpose. However, they avoid showing their faces and incite their puppets to come out and bark, claiming it as the "automatic" action of the Chinese people. This plan is indeed cunning and poisonous. Because they think that in this way, they can avoid responsibility, and our friendly nations may even be misunderstood and resent us, and will not come to help us. However, it is undeniable that this plan will certainly not be effective, and the degree of its meanness and shamelessness makes people unable to speak.

Therefore, we do not exclude foreigners; we only resist the enemy; we allow not to exclude foreigners who help us, and we want to resist the enemy who slanders us for excluding foreigners!

### Leaving Songzhuang

— Li Qiao

——Recollections of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou

When we retreated from Yuwang Mountain, the order was to defend Phoenix Mountain, Batou Mountain, and Suyang Mountain. Unexpectedly, after resting in Songzhuang for two days, another order arrived: Retreat to Yunlong Mountain!

Where is Yunlong Mountain? It is said to be in Xuzhou. At that time, the enemy had quietly infiltrated the Longhai Railway between Mengcheng and Yongcheng, blown up the Huangkou Iron Bridge, and was surrounding Xuzhou...

But we did not believe that Xuzhou would be lost. When we previously transferred from the Pinghan Railway to the Longhai Railway, passing through Xuzhou to Taierzhuang, we only casually glanced at Xuzhou and hurriedly parted ways. Now, upon hearing the order to retreat to Yunlong Mountain, we were all very happy! Because we could go to Xuzhou to have fun again. But at the same time, we felt a bit of sadness: all this land, all this wheat, was about to be trampled by the enemy's iron hooves!

With endless feelings of reluctance, one night, while the people of Songzhuang were sound asleep, we quietly left Songzhuang and set off for Xuzhou.

People walked urgently one after another. The cavalry rode comfortably on strong horses, half-running to get ahead. The heavy artillery, pulled by eight large mules, rolled slowly at the back of the队伍, with terrible yellow dust continuously entering people's nostrils and mouths, making people feel somewhat suffocated.

Trucks carrying military supplies, creaking from time to time, rushed up from behind. The strong lights made people afraid to turn around and look at them, so they had to stand by the roadside to let them pass, and then choked in the dust to catch up with the队伍 ahead.

The sky was dotted with countless bright stars, and the earth was so dark and沉沉的. The endless wheat field, gently swaying in the breeze, had been swallowed by the darkness. The trees appeared as dark shadows, standing like giants. The night wind, carrying a hint of coldness, blew towards people from time to time, making them feel a little cold!

In the villages near and far, the sound of horses' hooves often brought about bursts of dogs barking, and other than that, there was no sound at all. Everything was so quiet.

The endless队伍, like a black stream, silently surged across the vast northern plain, without stopping, as if they were all iron men and horses, never tired.

At dawn, to avoid enemy planes, we stopped to rest in a small village called Huangguang, with only four or five families, but the people had already fled. At dusk, the队伍 continued to advance along the highway covered with three or four inches of yellow dust.

Bang! Bang... Suddenly, a series of crisp gunshots came from the front, followed by increasingly dense fire. Amidst the chaotic gunshots, the sound of artillery also resounded loudly. Soon, a glowing fire rose in front, illuminating the sky so fiery red.

"What's going on?"

"Probably encountered the enemy!"

But it didn't seem like an encounter with the enemy at all. The队伍 continued to advance without any fear, and bullets whizzed past.

Boom! Suddenly, a red light like lightning flashed, followed by a startling explosion, illuminating the nearby villages shrouded in darkness so clearly. This made us exclaim in surprise and quickly duck our heads:

"What are they doing?"

No one knew. Everyone walked mechanically with a tense heart. But soon, news came from the front: This was a friendly army ordered to retreat, and they had automatically burned the military supplies they could not take away at the Daxujia Station on the Longhai Railway. Although this was unavoidable, and although it damaged the Longhai Railway, preventing the enemy forces advancing from Pixian from moving along the railway line, we all felt a kind of indescribable heartache when we thought that the bullets bought with the people's blood and sweat could not be fired into the enemy's chest!

Some cars that had broken down somewhere were abandoned on the roadside without anyone caring for them. Horses and oxen that had been dragged to death carrying military supplies lay on the highway covered in yellow dust, making people feel a sense of sadness: even horses and oxen have walked to death, how can our two feet withstand more than horses and oxen? But we are not horses and oxen after all, walk! walk! walk!

Walking non-stop, eyes that hadn't slept for one day and two nights felt as if something was pressing on the eyelids, and the eyelids kept wanting to close. The head was so昏沉沉的 and we were already in a state of half-sleep, but our minds were clear, and we were still vigilant.

When the east spat out a hazy dawn, we finally reached the camp - Tongcun.

### A Traveler in the Desert

— Liu You

This is not a remote mountain area, nor is it the vast ocean, but a boundless expanse of land, a vast desert composed of countless sand dunes.

Thousands of miles, tens of thousands of miles, unable to see the path ahead, unable to see the end. What is seen is a cloudy sky, and a vast expanse of sand and soil, unable to see the lovely and pleasing green, unable to feel the vibrant life.

All year round, it is so silent, without a trace of human habitation, extremely desolate. This desert blocks people's way, like a towering mountain soaring into the clouds, impossible to walk past, impossible to jump over, impossible to fly over!

Crossing a big river, crossing a vast ocean, does not require much strength, but crossing this vast desert requires great perseverance!

In the desert, no one dares to venture deep; only the struggling heroes, and their faithful companions—camels, with a spirit of transcendence, pass through this desolate world!

No sunlight, no water, and no place to rest, only struggling forward, enduring hunger and thirst!

A whirlwind rolls up the sand, causing travelers to lose their way, but this does not give them the slightest fear. They pause for a moment, rally their spirits, and move forward again!

Vast expanse, after endless time, they still have not reached their destination, but they will not be discouraged, and they continue to proceed slowly. They know that one day, they will jump out of this death-like world and embark on the path of "success"!

### The Blood Wine of Life

— Mei Yibai

"Drink me with the blood wine of life, return to me freedom and light."

I want to jump, I want to shout, I want to cry, no; I'm going crazy.

Everything around is pitch black, unable to see the sky and the sun, without any light, not even a star.

People say that spring has already arrived, but I can't see it. Is it obscured by tall buildings? Has it been frightened away by artillery fire? Perhaps it has been buried under piles of rubble. Ah! Where is spring?

I love freedom, but some people won't let you be free. Do you want to hang a national flag? They will tell you to take it down. Do you love your country? Perhaps someone will interfere with you. Ah! You are not free, do you know?

Look at those ghost-like creatures, they laugh, they dance; they sell their souls, they sell everything.

Everything revolves around you, darkness assaults you, terror ambushes you, wealth and status entice you. Making you suffocate, making you angry, making you disgusted.

This is an isolated island! No freedom, no light, not allowed to move, only to be content to be a human being.

Give me the blood wine of life, because I am too depressed.

### Food, Sex, and Shelter

— Chi Qiang

These past few weeks, I’ve been busy sending airmail letters. The letters are written in a telegram-like style, barely filling a single page; but the items attached to the letters are impossible to reduce. The nights are long and fraught with dreams, so the postage adds up quite a bit. Since I’ve never flown in an airplane myself, the fact that these dispatched spiritual emissaries have the chance to “cleave the waves, journeying thirty thousand *li*” does give me a fresh feeling in my otherwise mundane life. I’m floating on air, among the stars, writing in the style of high antiquity. Even if the plane should crash, at least I’d have the satisfaction of literally causing “fallen petals to write on the water’s surface”!

Because of this, I’ve been thinking about life’s big questions. Here we go again! Life, one can’t have it both ways. When we’re in the throes of resistance, friends! Don’t let heterodox theories deflate you. Moreover, dispersing the population is also a way of “performing one’s duties in rank.” Personal bullets and group bullets are equally indifferent to the meaning of life, so what’s the point of being clever? Let’s talk about that after we’ve laid down our arms and promoted culture!

Then I remember that one still has to aim when shooting, and the point of aiming is none other than to “clearly identify the enemy.” Aiming without hitting the target just means the enemy will “laugh in your face.” Of course, I’m not the one to speak clearly on this matter, having never taken to the field of battle myself.

Let’s just say—the “let’s just say” is quite reasonable. Instead of digressing, let’s stick to the point that “resistance is above all else.” Simply embracing that one point is already enough. However, living in this place that is neither the front lines nor the rear, in a place that’s half “tin can town” and half “ivory tower,” even the “bright eyes and gleaming teeth” of cultured women who occasionally become seized by patriotic passion during this war of resistance can really be disheartening!

People are so busy, it’s practically impossible to find a free moment. As soon as one thing is finished, something else comes up. And after that’s finished, yet another thing keeps coming up, until the dark-haired grow old, and the steadfast are shaken off. And then there are those duties that are neither specifically assigned nor officially required—the non-duties that are eating, sex, and shelter—that keep butting in, making it so a person must strenuously carry out the business of food, sex, and shelter in addition to speaking of love (for one’s country) and resistance (against the enemy). It is the gentlemen of the isolated island and their partners of all kinds who excel most joyfully at this, in what some call “red-blooded happiness”! “One won’t give up until reaching the Yellow River, and once there, one wants to cross it.” That’s what makes the sea of desire so boundless, beyond all hope of rescue!

Food, sex, shelter: the deepest desires of mankind exist here! The ancients said that “food and sex are human nature.” Eating, making love, and sleeping: these are today’s equivalents, and one can’t get by without any of them.

Yu Dafu once said, “Behind vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while in the fields, there are corpses of the frozen. That’s why there must be class struggle. On one side, there are three thousand beauties in the emperor’s harem, and the king never tires of looking at them. On the other side, there is a wife’s separation from her husband in Stone Rampart Village, her husband garrisoned at Xiao Pass while she stays in Wu. That’s why there must be revolution.” And then he went on to explain:

“However, because the desires for food and sex are so basic, they are very easy to satisfy. No matter how great an epicure you are, you can be knocked out with just a flagon of wine, one chicken, three bowls of white rice, and a big flatbread. Once you’re full, even if someone invites you to a feast, you can’t eat another bite. As for sex, no matter how virile you are, you can only deal with at most ten women. After ten women, even if it were Xi Shi or Yang Guifei, they couldn’t arouse your desire.”

That seems to resolve part of life’s desires, so perhaps there’s no need to say any more.

However, “Once they’re full, do you expect them to love their country? After they’ve ‘lost all sexual desire,’ do you expect them to resist or step onto the front lines of national salvation?” No, no, that is a very lofty theory! Ever since Liang Qichao designed that “manure-making machine”; ever since Bian Que said that “when semen is generated, the body is strengthened”; ever since the doctrine of “environmental relations”; ever since the pretense of “rear-area duty”; ever since the decision “not to be a traitor for the time being”; and ever since the idea that “if you have something to say, you should say it to your own people first” was articulated so reasonably that it perfectly aligned with the supreme principle that the nation is above all else, only then did everyone quietly retreat and huddle together in eating, sex, and shelter, seeking pleasure in life.

Large advertisements, a throng of writhing pedestrians, towering architecture, window displays—all of this is striving to add a footnote to my text, locally providing evidence.

I don’t understand the psychology of various groups in society, so everything I say comes out wrong. But who can live without white rice, sex, and sleep?

It is precisely because one cannot live without them that some people stirred up political turmoil to make money off government bonds in the past, and now that the nation is in crisis, some are able to profit off the nation’s plight. As for embezzling relief grain, silencing those who speak out, and skimming some foreign exchange to stuff their own pockets, their great desires are so well-versed in the sixty-four hexagrams that they can make use of any of them.

Cao Juren once distinguished between traitors and puppets. The kind of people one sees before one’s eyes probably won’t all become traitors, but there seem to be elements that contain the possibility of becoming puppets.

When that time comes, then after eating, sex, and shelter, there will be a new excuse arising from the “pressure of the environment,” and then we, a group of friends who are rushing to be busy for nothing with our pens, will finally feel it was all in vain!

Shanghai Special

### New Pharmaceutical Industry in Shanghai Sun Chucheng

Medicines are for curing diseases, and there is essentially no such thing as old or new. What is currently called new medicine refers to national medicine that has been used for thousands of years without refinement. This term was established by Mr. Huang Chujiu of Yuyao, a pioneer in the field of new medicines. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, when the National Revolutionary Army settled in Southeast China, major pharmacies formed an industry association. Mr. Huang suggested that the various medicines sold in pharmacies recently included Chinese herbal ingredients and Eastern medicines, and the original term Western medicine seemed insufficient to fully encompass them. Moreover, the Ministry of the Interior had changed Western medicine to new medicine, so Western medicine should also be changed to new medicine. After discussion, everyone agreed and decided on the change. Since Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs in our country thousands of years ago, all medicines have been mostly herbs, trees, insects, and stones in terms of quality; in terms of manufacturing methods, they are nothing more than stir-frying, steaming, soaking, and temporary decoction. The quantity is large and the taste is bitter. It is inconvenient for patients with weak appetites to swallow them. This is not as effective as the extraction and refinement of Western medicines, which take the essence and remove the dregs. The quantity is small and the power is strong. They are beautiful and easy to take. This is why Western medicines can be imported and seize our rights and interests. Enlightened people, in view of the prosperity of science and the increasing belief in Western medicine among the people, if they do not find ways to remedy the situation, the outflow of rights and interests will have a significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, they have all shifted their focus and tried their best to imitate them, hoping to block the loopholes. This is also good news in the voice of advocating domestic products. Shanghai is a major trading port, and there are more pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories than in other provinces and cities. Moreover, the goods sold in pharmacies in the interior are mostly wholesale from Shanghai, so the new pharmaceutical industry in Shanghai leads the country. The Joint Association of New Pharmaceutical Industry Associations across the country is also located in Shanghai. The Ministry of Health also invited representatives from the association to participate in the regulations for managing drug dealers, in order to promote it. Currently, 108 companies have joined the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association. The names are divided into pharmacies, drug stores, and pharmaceutical factories, and the organization has sole proprietorship, partnership, and stockholding. The following 28 companies emphasize both retail and wholesale: Wuzhou, Sino-French, Sino-Western, Sino-British, Huamei, Huayang, Huaying, Nanyang, Jicheng, Taihe, Aihua, Xinhua, Baohua, Tianhua, Dalu, Dahua, Dasheng, Wanguo, Gongda, Zhengwei, Hongxing, Foci, Jicang, Yonghe, Jihuatang, Pacific, Lianchangde, and Weierkang. The following 66 companies emphasize wholesale: Xinya, Xinyi, Luowei, Zhengde, Jiufu, Jiuneng, Danwei, Fuzi, Dazhong, Daxia, Dalong, Huasheng, Huafu, Hualuo, Qinkang, Huikang, Zhonghua, Zhongguo, Yuanxia, Renshou, Haoyou, Haolai, Bailing, Baizhong, Haipu, Lida, Tongren, Zhile, Qingcheng, Peiji, Jinlong, Keda, Weiling, Meili, Taihe, Taixin, Yamei, Yazhou, Guotai, Guomin, Xinxing, Xinyi, Xinsheng, Xinkang, Huifeng, Fufeng, Fuer, Dehua, Yaohua, Luying, Wanguo, Yongxin, Fukang, Zhenye, Zhide, Keerden, Haimideng, Bailedeng, Meilindeng, Yien's, Sideng's, Yuexuanzhai, Anlisi, Habate, Qimoke, and Huaxingchang. The following 14 companies emphasize retail: Shijie, Zhonghe, Zhongou, Zhongde, Minghua, Xianghua, Dongfang, Dongnan, Baode, Huade, Huacheng, Tianyi, Chongji, and Dashengtang. They cooperate with each other and seek progress every day. In addition to the Western medicine departments of the Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, and The Sun department stores, there are also dozens of companies such as Lizhi, Guotai, Watson's, and Lao Deji that have not joined the association. They must also abide by the industry regulations set by the association in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the ministry. In recent years, the efficacy of self-made new medicines has been able to keep pace with imported products of the same nature, and the prices are much lower. Therefore, sales of foreign goods have decreased day by day, and many rights and interests have been recovered every year. Taking the business in the 27th year of the Republic of China as an example, the wholesale aspect has decreased compared to before the war due to inconvenient transportation, difficult transportation, poor people in the occupied areas, weak purchasing power, and sluggish business; occasionally, several products are essential for home travel and are easy to carry, so sales have not decreased, which is an exception. On the retail side, the number of people in Shanghai has surged, and people from all over the world have mostly escaped to Shanghai, who have been weathered and suffered hardships. Once they catch a cold, they are prone to illness, so sales have increased compared to before the 813 Incident last year; and as foreign exchange has tightened, raw material prices have soared, and those with more inventory have made more profits. Many pharmacies in other cities have closed down due to the war. Although they were changed to cash transactions after August 13 last year, the accounts released before August 13 could not be recovered, and they suffered great losses. In terms of overall calculation, due to the increase in the price of goods, the sales volume in the 27th year was less than the previous year; in terms of the amount of goods in and out, it was more than the previous year, and each company had a surplus. However, the amount of surplus depends on the adequacy of its inventory.

### Recent Construction Industry in Shanghai Tang Zenan, Shan Qingfu

Since the outbreak of the August 13 Incident, most of the people in Hongkou and Nanshi areas have fled into the concessions, so the population of the concessions has surged, and the original houses have been completely rented out. Even those that have been abandoned for many years are rented at a good price. Later, those who came to Shanghai to avoid the war became more and more numerous, and the supply and demand situation became even more disparate. A single bed needed dozens of gold, and the monopolization of the market and speculation led to daily disputes; it is inevitable where there is profit.

In the spring of this year, the construction industry was greatly active as a result, and a large number of houses were built separately. However, the method was mostly to have the tenants decide and pay all the expenses required for the project, and then they could live for a certain number of years, or sell the base and the house together, which could solve part of the problem; however, it was also limited to those with financial resources who could purchase it, while those without financial resources still could not quench their thirst by looking at plums.

Currently, the price of construction materials has increased by 5% to 100% compared to before due to the soaring foreign exchange, traffic congestion, and special circumstances, and the construction cost has naturally increased accordingly. Those who need houses have no ability to operate on their own, and those who have the ability to invest must also calculate the interest they should get, so the increase in the price of houses is also a matter of course. Now, the market prices of ordinary building materials before and after the war are listed below as an example for comparison:

Since the demand for construction is in short supply and land prices have soared, it is inevitable; however, those who come are still endless, not being deterred by the high prices. This is because Shanghai, although it has formed an isolated island, can still maintain the surface of safety, so factories and houses are thriving together. According to recent statistics:

More than 1,000 new factories, more than 1,000 shops,
More than 3,000 houses, and more than 400 residences

The various houses currently being built have mostly found ways to reduce the materials used, or slightly changed the grade of materials, in order to balance the cost; however, compared to before, it can no longer be calculated in reason. A large number of wooden houses have been built in the western district to temporarily meet the needs; the residents below the middle class cannot afford it, so they have to gather here. Of course, it is not in line with the law, but it is necessary to give them accommodation and help them out of their poverty.

### The Shipping Industry Over the Last Century by Runmin

Over the last century, the British firm Jardine Matheson and its various founders have diligently managed their business, relying on the combination of trade between the East and the West to integrate the ancient civilizations of the East with the mechanical progress of the West, benefiting all parties. Based on this commercial partnership, the friendship has not only lasted for over a century but is also expected to flourish in the future.

When Reverend Gutzlaff served as a translator for Jardine Matheson in Guangzhou in 1834, he often traveled the seas on Jardine Matheson's ships. Reverend Gutzlaff once wrote a letter to Dr. Jardine, saying:

"Your Excellency has done your utmost to assist in promoting free trade between the Western countries and China; a satisfactory result will be achieved in science and commerce in the future."

From the above, it can be seen that Jardine Matheson has always been uninvolved in political issues, relying solely on business to enhance cultural and moral exchange between both sides, a result that could never be achieved by those involved in politics. Therefore, the motto "serving as the purpose of doing business" has become the company's guiding principle. During these extraordinary times, the company's reputation has remained intact, which can be traced back to this very principle.

A brief history of Jardine Matheson can be described as follows:

In 1802, Dr. Jardine, then working for the East India Company, recognized the potential for development in Far Eastern trade. However, restricted by the company's regulations, which prevented employees from extensively managing businesses, he resigned from his position at the East India Company and set sail for Australia. He happened to meet MacNagg, and after a conversation, they became close friends. At the time, MacNagg was the manager of MacNagg & Co. and had already obtained a business license issued by the East India Company.

Matheson was then working in a store in Calcutta run by his uncle. Due to his adventurous spirit, he went to Guangzhou in 1818 and joined MacNagg & Co., jointly funded by Jardine and MacNagg. Jardine transported goods between China and India, while Matheson was stationed in India, distributing all goods shipped from the Far East by Jardine. MacNagg traveled between Guangzhou and Macau, acting as an agent for imported goods from India and the Straits Settlements.

After MacNagg & Co. was dissolved on June 30, 1832, Jardine Matheson (also known as Jardine's) was officially established on July 1 of the same year. The current taipan of the company, Sir Jardine, is the great-nephew of Dr. Jardine. Most of the current directors of the company also come from this esteemed family. Their birthplace is the parish of Denfee in Scotland.

After the Treaty of Nanking was signed on August 29, 1842, Shanghai was opened as a trading port on November 17 of the following year. By the end of the year, seven foreign ships had arrived, the largest of which was Jardine Matheson's "Ilyza Stewart," with a tonnage of 423 tons.

At that time, there were no shipping companies in China, so those engaged in trade had to own their own ships. Jardine Matheson possessed a large number of such vessels. Most of the famous clippers flew the "white water, blue sea, one" flag.

Trade between northern and southern China began in 1833 with the brig "Mermaid." Subsequently, Jardine Matheson ships also traveled along the coast and within the Yangtze River. When Japan opened its ports in 1858, Jardine Matheson was among the first to send ships. The grandfather of the current managing director, Mr. William Keswick, was very interested in Japanese trade. He devoted most of his life to promoting trade between Japan and foreign countries.

These businesses were later merged to form the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, engaged in increasing trade between India and the Far East. Currently, five large vessels regularly operate between Calcutta and the Far East.

In 1829, Matheson introduced the steam engine to the Far East. He hired a tugboat, the "Forbes," to tow the fully loaded sailing ship "The Mechane" to China. Confident in his success, he bet that if they did not reach their destination within three months, he would pay a penalty of one thousand gold coins. Unfortunately, due to unfavorable weather, they arrived two days later than expected, and Matheson's initial plan failed.

However, this type of experiment was not repeated, as it was discovered that there was no suitable coal in Guangzhou for the application of steam engines. Later, the "Forbes" used timber instead of coal as fuel, fully loaded with cargo, and sailed back to Calcutta, promising the cargo owners that if they arrived at their destination within one month, the freight would be halved. This trip was considered successful.

In 1835, the company planned to ship the first steamship to China for use between Guangzhou and Macau. However, due to the lack of precedent, it was rejected by the Manchu Emperor with a rescript. Therefore, although the ship's engine was already installed, it was forced to be removed. The ship then operated as a sailing ship between various coastal ports.

In the same year, the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company's clipper "Sylph" sailed from Calcutta to Lintin in 17 days and 17 hours. This sailing speed record has not been broken to this day.

In 1844, after signing a contract, the company began the first steam passenger service between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, with the ship named "Corsair." Therefore, it can be said that the use of steamships on the Chinese coast began in 1844. The great power of machinery replaced the natural force of wind, and the poetic white sails in the clear blue sea could no longer compete with steamships.

The steamships at that time were single-decked, and the cabins were all located around the paddle wheels. The stern wheelers known today had not yet been invented. In the turbulent sea, the sound of the paddle wheels splashing water was constant, and one can imagine the suffering of travelers.

However, the increase in speed was the most effective measure, so all shortcomings were improved and perfected. The company's fleet of ships rapidly expanded, and Jardine Matheson ships could be found in major cities in China, Japan, and Calcutta. The initial steamships had a load capacity of only 500 tons, but they gradually expanded. Today, the scale of Jardine Matheson ships is so large that it has reached its limit due to the restrictions of inland river draft and dock capacity.

Today, the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company (part of Jardine Matheson) has a fleet of ships with perfect facilities, comparable to any shipping company in the world. Although it cannot be fully expanded due to environmental constraints, it is practically sufficient. The company's recently built "Desheng, Yongsheng, Taisheng" have expanded trade along the Chinese coast from Tianjin through various major ports to Haiphong, traveling at 15 nautical miles per hour. These types of ships have exceeded the speed of other transport ships traveling along the Chinese coast. Taking "Taisheng" as an example, the voyage from Shantou to Shanghai takes only 42 hours.

As for the four new ships that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company previously ordered from the UK, they have been resold to the company by the Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Committee and have been reconditioned. Although the speed is only 12 nautical miles, the voyage from Hong Kong via Shantou to Shanghai, even with the northeast monsoon, takes only three and a half days. These types of ships have been renamed Yisheng, Yusheng, Hesheng, and Minsheng. The increased speed of these ships will surely be appreciated by cargo owners, freight forwarders, and passengers. The cabins have also been greatly improved, especially the four ships mentioned above. The facilities for various classes of Chinese passengers are unmatched by any other ships operating along the Chinese coast. Jardine Matheson will operate these excellent ships separately along the coast. With the cooperation of cargo owners and passengers, the ships will arrive and depart on time, benefiting both cargo owners and passengers.

Jardine Matheson has made great efforts to adapt to the current difficult environment. For this reason, Jardine Matheson's flag can still be seen flying throughout China, and its navigation along the coast and inland rivers remains effective and pleasant. The current situation is similar to the early days of the company, and temporary plans and new routes must be developed to meet the needs of the public. The widespread distribution of Jardine Matheson's management offices today shows that it has far exceeded its past scope.

To achieve the above objectives while respecting treaty terms, the company has established close cooperation with the Zhonghe Transportation Company, managed by Mr. Zhang Ruizhi. Zhonghe Transportation Company has had many years of relationship with Jardine Matheson, and since 1935, it has implemented the issuance of responsible intermodal bills of lading directly from various ports to inland areas, even as far as Xi'an Prefecture in Shaanxi Province. This approach has been quite effective and has greatly benefited cargo owners.

In August 1937, traffic on the Yangtze River was disrupted. Fortunately, the company's loyal service enabled the transportation of tens of thousands of tons of goods between Shanghai and Hankou, rerouting them through Jiangbei. This was implemented for several months and proved very effective. More recently, the company has cooperated with Zhonghe Transportation Company to shift its focus to the Haiphong route, handling the Shanghai-Yunnan intermodal transportation.

Since August 1938, Zhonghe Transportation Company has established branches and agencies in Haiphong, Kunming, and Chongqing, and all goods are transported through intermodal transportation systems, flowing smoothly throughout the regions. These measures are implemented entirely in accordance with Jardine Matheson's business policy, without involving other interests than commercial ones. Recently, a branch and warehouse have also been established in Guangzhou Bay, with large quantities of goods transported inland via motorways.

These facilities are fraught with difficulties, but those involved are able to overcome them with a spirit of enterprise. The way things are done today is different from the past, but only those who are brave and unafraid of difficulties can succeed in their careers. Jardine Matheson has faced difficulties not just today, but today's Jardine Matheson, with the support of its loyal employees and the full cooperation of all colleagues at Zhonghe Transportation Company, can overcome difficulties with an indomitable spirit. Jardine Matheson's reputation today has also been built on this spirit.

Spring and Autumn

### Sweeping Away Counterfeit Money

— Ba Dun

For nearly two years of the war of resistance, our country's finance has remained as stable as ever, and the credibility of legal tender has become increasingly prominent. For this, the enemy has racked their brains, attempting to disrupt our finance and fantasizing about undermining the credibility of our legal tender. For example, manufacturing counterfeit currency issued by the "United Reserve Bank," forcing its use in controlled areas, absorbing legal tender to obtain foreign exchange, and manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit notes to allow unscrupulous individuals to mix them into the market. But these have been properly resisted by our government, dealing a significant blow to the enemy's conspiracy. Just as the enemy was at their wit's end and extremely frustrated, the Equalization Fund for maintaining the credibility of legal tender was suddenly established. This was tantamount to a head-on blow to the enemy. Therefore, it is no wonder that the Japanese warlords were so anxious that they were at their wit's end, prompting their mouthpieces to say something like: "It can be said that Britain's maintenance of Chinese legal tender is tantamount to joining China's economic guerrilla warfare" and barking out for revenge!

There is no doubt that our country's legal tender will become more stable in the future; but can we assume that Japan will therefore abandon this conspiracy? Absolutely not! Not only will they not, but the enemy will use their claws to expand and intensify this aggression! Recently, the enemy has forcibly used the counterfeit currency of the counterfeit "United Reserve Bank" in North China, and the Ministry of Finance has recently received confidential reports stating that the Japanese are counterfeiting huge sums of counterfeit money in Dalian, with 22 million yuan already attempting to be mixed into various occupied areas. Therefore, it has specifically telegraphed to the provincial governments to instruct their subordinates and chambers of commerce to closely guard against it. All of these are clear evidence.

Regarding the enemy's forced use of "United Reserve Bank" counterfeit currency in North China, the first symposium record of the Economic Supplement of this newspaper (March 27), the article "The Future of Legal Tender Ban in North China" has already provided a detailed and thorough explanation, so there is no need for me to repeat it. What I want to say here is how we should deal with the problem of counterfeit legal tender that is organized, planned, and used on a large scale in the market.

Counterfeit yarn mixing into the market with genuine ones did not begin now. It had been prevalent before the war and became a confidant concern in the financial industry. However, at that time, first, there were laws that could be sanctioned, and the strict crackdown by military and police authorities made the general unscrupulous people have scruples; second, because the scale of counterfeit money manufacturing agencies was small, and the printing technology was also very poor, even those without much experience could identify it, so its threat was not very great. However, the current situation is very different, the disruptors are not small, but deliberately will not weaken our legal tender and will not give up. They have a large-scale manufacturing agency and sophisticated printing techniques, and they are mass-producing. Therefore, the harm caused is far greater than in the past. If we do not rise up to sweep away counterfeit money, the impact on the credibility of legal tender and people's lives will be unimaginable. Therefore, whether it is to consolidate finance to ensure the final victory, or to avoid our own losses, eliminating counterfeit money is a matter of urgency.

A few days ago, I met a friend Mr. So-and-so who worked in the financial industry, and when talking about this matter, he also had a strong sense of agreement. After a heated discussion, we reached four conclusions. Although these four conclusions cannot completely eliminate counterfeit money, they can at least make the invaders feel thorny, and finally force them to give up this poisonous scheme. The conclusions are as follows:

(1) Urge the military and police authorities in the concession to strictly crack down.

(2) The silver and money industry associations and various trade associations should stipulate a "unified" drama record and notify all members to immediately stamp it when they encounter counterfeit money; and make this stipulated signature public to the society.

(3) Collect various counterfeit tickets and exhibit them publicly so that the general public can guard against them

(4) Those who have special experience in identifying counterfeit tickets should announce the weaknesses of counterfeit money to the public (Regarding this point, I believe that the revenue and expenditure personnel of financial institutions that have the most contact with banknotes should assume this responsibility.)

### Talking About "Not Eating Shark Fin"

— Yan

Shark fin is a noble food in cuisine, a delicacy among mountain delicacies and seafood, but also an unparalleled luxury. Its origin, in addition to Luzon and Borneo, is Japan; although China's coastline is long, and it is a famous place for producing giant sharks, due to fishing methods, it has not yet reached scientific equipment, so relying solely on indigenous methods of capture, shark fin is extremely difficult to produce. The source of shark fin in Shanghai is mostly imported from Japan, and only a small number are imported from Southeast Asia; therefore, from the current standpoint of the war of resistance, it is definitely said that shark fin is all "inferior goods," so as to make the people completely stop eating, there is really no place for excessive words.

Recently, the Chamber of Commerce of the city has advised all shops and households that wine banquets necessary for celebrations, weddings, funerals, etc., should abolish the use of shark fin, in order to save extravagance, fulfill their conscience duties, and help refugees; this is both from the principle of "saving to help the needy" and "National Spiritual Mobilization," and it is a matter of urgency, which should be earnestly practiced by every wealthy Chinese on the isolated island. At the same time, in order to preserve the national strength of the war of resistance and not make unnecessary consumption - especially this consumption contains the element of "funding the enemy," then it should be completely abolished!

However, if other precious dishes are still used after not eating shark fin, such as replacing them with bird's nest, white fungus, bear paws, deer tendons, etc., then although there is no longer the blame of "funding the enemy," it still greatly violates the principles of "economy" and "spiritual mobilization," and there is still the suspicion of "changing the soup without changing the medicine"!

Our goal: to transfer all the money saved from "not eating shark fin" at every wine banquet to disaster relief and donations.

Fellow compatriots in Shanghai! Let us no longer lose this conscience-driven awakening, forever, okay?

Life Report

### Three Years Later, The Sorrows of an Apprentice

— (Wuguang)

Our company's regulations: The apprenticeship period for apprentices is three years. In the first year of entry, the monthly fee is two yuan, and then it increases by one or two yuan each year. After three years, you can receive a salary of ten yuan per month.

Three years seems like a long time, and the hope is this meager ten yuan. But in this year of "difficult to eat," "less porridge and more monks," so I obediently came in.

Finally, the long time slipped by in a gray atmosphere, but the hope became a broken illusion. Why? ...

What we receive every month from the fat hand of the accounting section chief is still two dilapidated banknotes. Can we complain about our fate? So, we started to resist:

"Mr. ×, we have been here for three years!"

"That's right. But after 'August 13th,' the factory has been stagnant, and the company has no income. You should know that."

We had nothing to say, took the two dilapidated banknotes, and silently left the accounting office.

But we also know that the company's business was booming in the past few years: the factory started night work, the prices of goods kept rising, and the accumulated fund accumulated more than one million.

So, has this one million yuan been depleted after "August 13th"? No! Not at all. But the company borrowed the name of "August 13th" and even refused to pay the meager ten yuan per month that we should have received after three years.

Does such a large company have to haggle over these few yuan? Moreover, the staff has also been laid off, and the salary has also been deducted.

Undoubtedly, this is an unreasonable pressure! We were deceived. It was two yuan three years ago, and it is still two yuan three years later. Then what about four years later, five years later? China's war of resistance is long-term, and our monthly fee of two yuan per month should also be long-term, right?

And the age is increasing year by year. Who has deprived us of our precious years? Who has eroded our youth? Even a meager and pitiful hope has been shattered. - Ah - we were deceived.

Resist? There is no such thing. Anyway, there are many people in this year, if you don't want to be here, get out!

Even further, unite the same class and use collective power to fight. But we have recognized this era. During the war of resistance, we do not want to stir up a wave of struggle.

So, we are depressed.

We have no extravagant hopes. We hope that the company authorities can understand our small sorrow and fulfill the previous promise: and then let everyone cooperate to tide over this difficult and great era.

### River Love Song

— Ruhua

"St. Louis Blues"

Paramount Pictures Production, Nanjing Grand Theater Screening

Dorothy Lamour and Lloyd Nolan Co-star

Since "Animal Crackers" and "The Jungle Princess," Dorothy Lamour's name has been deeply imprinted on the minds of the audience. Lamour's alluring and provocative singing voice is indeed loved by the general young audience, but her plump figure, charming eyes, slender hair, and Southern flair are all loved by audiences who love Hollywood works. Therefore, even if Lamour only makes a cameo appearance singing a song in "College Holiday," it is also used to call on the audience by the character that Dorothy Lamour plays.

"River Love Song" does have a Lamour-style story, and it copies the form of "The Boat Show," and the romance happens in the "St. Louis Blues" showboat on the Mississippi River. The story is too simple to be simpler. Lamour, because she doesn't want to play the role of a South Sea woman in a brocade apron anymore, ignores the manager's contract and escapes to the "St. Louis Blues" showboat. So, she falls in love with the boat owner Dave and eventually becomes a family.

In our memory, there are many examples of similar stories, but there are also many that can give us technical learning due to the superiority of the compilation and direction, but "River Love Song" has failed in these two points.

First: This story takes place on a showboat. Due to the lack of detailed scene division, it appears very trivial and chaotic. It is also a pity that Dorothy Lamour cannot be given more opportunities to act besides singing.

Second: The director does use comedic skills and small gimmicks to win the laughter of the audience, but he also cannot focus on the main line, rendering, emphasizing, making it deep and moving. As for using music and the reflection on the river to set off the showboat's mood, there are indeed scenes that make people leisurely fascinated, but it cannot give people a feeling of dissolving. The biggest drawback is that the love process between Lamour and Lloyd Nolan is written very vaguely. For example, when Lloyd Nolan specifically selected a song and asked Lamour to sing it, Lamour was so sad that she could not sing because of the manager's newspaper advertisement, but the director let it go faintly. The scene where Lamour came back was also not prominent enough. Other connections are not clear enough, which is also a major flaw.

Just like the last scene, which should be the climax of the film, although the director has taken care of all aspects, the excitement may be excitement, but from the black woman singing until Lamour finishes singing, the excitement is only superficial.

And Lamour finally appeared in the apron of a native woman, which may be a sign of her love for Lloyd Nolan, and it can also be said to be her forgiveness for the manager, but it is just the opposite of her refusal to play the native woman at the beginning. This is not so much a contradiction of the playwright as a contradiction of the Hollywood film company. Sonja Henie became famous for skating, will they give up skating movies in the future? Even if a movie is made to make the audience tired of watching it, who dares to say that Sonja Henie's next work is not a skating movie? Lamour's apron is the same, no exception.

Lloyd Nolan used to specialize in detective films, and Dave here is not outstanding.

The few songs here, such as Moonlight at Shadow, will be popular in the dance halls, because they are all full of blue emotions.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 7: Paired Swallows and Warbling Orioles Cast Reflections, Yue Silk and Wu Brocade Weave Seven Patterns on the Loom

At this moment, Tong Haiying took a photograph of the He family's two sisters and their three younger brothers together. Then, He Liyu took a photograph of the three children, and their nanny, Ms. Kang Ning, was also included. Afterwards, they went around for another tour before returning. The two Misses He had been staying here for several days and had become quite familiar with the sisters here. However, they all had duties and could not accompany them on outings all the time, and they could also wander around on their own without disturbing their duties. Furthermore, the two sisters were both industrialists and specialists in the textile industry. Even in that small town, they took the opportunity to investigate everything. When their father left, he made sure to keep in touch by telegram and letter at any time. They knew where their father was staying in Beiping, so the day after arriving in Anle Town, they sent him a telegram, reporting that they had arrived at Zhu Ai’ren’s place and asking him not to worry. Although Anle Town was a small town, it had both a telegraph office and a post office, and transportation was very convenient. Moreover, in recent years, domestic telegraph rates in China had dropped to a very low level. Because telecommunications had developed, and revenue had increased, and since telegraphs were operated by the government for the convenience of the people, it was naturally made even more convenient. In many small cities and towns, the telegraph office and the post office were together. Just like in Anle Town, the telegraph office was in a corner of the post office. The reason was that the post office was very busy, while the telegraph office was relatively quiet. The two Misses He planned to stay in Anle Town for at least two weeks. If their father were to send a telegram or letter during these two weeks, it would only need to be forwarded to Freedom Village. Because from Anle Town to Freedom Village, it was not a long way, with automobiles and steamers running back and forth all day long, and countless people passing through. After the two Misses He sent the telegram to their father, they also wrote a detailed letter. In the pre-war postal service, because transportation was blocked in many parts of China, a letter often took several days to arrive. In inland China, where boats and vehicles were not available, and mountains and rivers separated places, it could take more than ten or even dozens of days. As for remote areas, it was possible to receive a letter every few months. But now it is very different. You should know that the post-war recovery power of our China is extremely strong, and the first reason is the convenience of transportation. Not only has it restored pre-war transportation, but it has also opened up many post-war transportation routes. Therefore, the government authorities are working hard. Because China's land is so vast and its people are so numerous, the more developed transportation is, the more developed the industry will be, and the progress of the country and society will be like a heavy rain, unstoppable.
