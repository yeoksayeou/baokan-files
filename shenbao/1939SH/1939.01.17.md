### British Note to Japan States Willingness to Negotiate with Independent and Sovereign China on Issues Such as Abolishing Extraterritoriality; France to Issue Similar Note

(London) Diplomatic circles here were greatly shocked by the strong wording of the most recent document submitted by British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. However, it is emphasized that the note does not definitively close the door to reconciliation and resolving disputes between Britain and Japan. (Reuters, 16th)

(London) The full text of the note presented yesterday to the Japanese government by British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie has been released. Responsible individuals commenting on it state that it is a stern warning from Britain to Japan, urging it to respect the Nine-Power Treaty both in letter and spirit. The U.S. government recently presented a similar note to Japan at the end of December. As the League of Nations Council meets, Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo is also expected to present a report on the Far Eastern situation. The timing of this British note is significant and worth considering. This note does not block the path for negotiations among the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty and recognizes the possibility of adjustments to the Far Eastern situation, similar to the U.S. note. However, if Japan refuses to acknowledge that the principle of the Open Door remains effective and does not follow the path of free negotiations to discuss the adjustment of the Far Eastern situation with relevant countries—in other words, if it ignores the Western powers—Britain and the United States may agree on retaliatory measures, which is not out of the question. Furthermore, the British note states that once peace is restored, the British government is willing to engage in negotiations with a "completely autonomous Chinese government" to reconsider the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction and abolish it completely. This kind of negotiation and friendly attitude was evident when the Weihaiwei administration was returned to the Chinese government in 1930. Its essence is different from Japan's so-called new policy towards China. (Havas, 15th)

(London) According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the British note to Japan was known to and approved by France long ago. Therefore, there is reason to believe that this note has been under consideration in London for quite some time. After the U.S. sent a note to Japan, Britain reconsidered the wording of its own note. The British and American notes are closely aligned. (Reuters, 16th)

(Paris) Well-informed sources here claim that the note presented to Japan yesterday by the British government was fully endorsed by the French government, and that it will present a similar note to the Japanese government in the near future. (Havas, 16th)

(Washington) Regarding the need to respect the Nine-Power Treaty, political figures here are very satisfied with the British government's note to Japan, issued yesterday. They say that the American position was explained by Secretary of State Hull in his note to Japan on December 31st of last year, and that its content is quite similar to the British note. Broadly speaking, the rights held by Britain and the United States in China were established by the Nine-Power Treaty, and both sides intend to safeguard them. They also reject Japan's proposal for a "New Order in East Asia." Their views are in agreement. The firm attitude adopted by the American government has exerted a positive influence on Britain. (Havas, 15th)

(London) The full text of the British government's note to Japan, which was released only today, is as follows. The note begins by stating that the British government, after studying the recent declarations of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and other Japanese politicians regarding Japan's new policy in the Far East, is uncertain about their intentions and has serious concerns. These concerns were not alleviated by the meeting between the British Ambassador to Japan and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. From these declarations and the official information released by Japan, the British government infers that the intention of the Japanese government is to establish a combination or group of Japan, China, and Manchuria, with Japan wielding authority and China and Manchuria in subordinate positions. As far as China is concerned, the Japanese government intends, at least for a certain period, to govern through the Asia Development Board, which is responsible for formulating and implementing policies regarding Chinese political, economic, and cultural affairs. Arita's statement to the press indicates that the aim of this tripartite combination is to create an economic unit in which the economic activities of other powers must be restricted by the group's defense needs and economic security. According to Prime Minister Konoe's declaration, the war against China will continue until the Chinese government is crushed or agrees to join the group on Japanese terms. Furthermore, China and Japan would conclude an anti-communist agreement, allowing Japan to station troops indefinitely in designated locations within China, ostensibly to ensure the fulfillment of Japanese truce terms. Moreover, Konoe stated that Inner Mongolia should be designated as a special anti-communist zone. The meaning of this is unclear, but until more information is available, it is reasonable to assume that Inner Mongolia will be subject to Japanese military control to an even greater extent than other parts of China. Konoe once assured that Japan did not want to seize Chinese territory and would respect its sovereignty. The British government does not understand how this statement can be reconciled with the Japanese government's declared intention to force the Chinese people to accept Japanese terms, which would involve handing over the control of their political, economic, and cultural life to Japan, maintaining a large number of Japanese troops in China indefinitely, and effectively separating Inner Mongolia from China. The British government now wishes to declare that Britain is not prepared to accept or recognize the nature of the changes expressed by Japan, as they have been achieved by force. The British government intends to uphold the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and cannot agree to a unilateral revision of its terms. The British government also wishes to point out that before the outbreak of the war, the beneficial effects that the treaty could be expected to produce were gradually being realized. The Chinese people are currently maintaining and developing an effective and stable government, and the principle of equal opportunity in industry is enabling China and its international trade, including Japan, to flourish. Therefore, the British government cannot accept Japan's suggestion that the Nine-Power Treaty is now obsolete or that its provisions no longer conform to the current situation. The situation created by Japan's violation of the treaty should be considered separately. The British government firmly insists that the treaty cannot be unilaterally revised and must be negotiated by all signatory countries. However, it does not believe that the treaty is of a permanent nature. Therefore, if the Japanese government has any specific suggestions regarding the amendment of any multilateral treaties related to China, the British government is prepared to consider them. In the meantime, the British government reserves all its rights under existing treaties. Furthermore, Konoe's declaration of December 22nd stated that Japan is prepared to consider abolishing extraterritoriality in China and recovering foreign concessions. This inducement to China to accept Japanese terms involves no sacrifice on the part of Japan, as there would be no need for extraterritoriality or concessions if Japan were to succeed in its plan to control China. The British government must recall that it had already been negotiating with the Chinese government on the abolition of British extraterritorial rights in 1931, and was on the verge of completion, but these negotiations were suspended by the Chinese government due to the turmoil caused by the Japanese seizure of Manchuria that year. However, the British government is always prepared to resume negotiations at the appropriate time, and is prepared to discuss this matter and other similar issues with a fully independent Chinese government once peace is restored. The conclusion states that if the British government has misunderstood the Japanese government's intentions in any possible way, it is due to the ambiguity of the language used by Japan to express these intentions. The British government would welcome a clearer and more detailed statement from Japan on its terms for ending the war and its policy towards China. (Reuters, 16th)

### Britain's Strong Note to Japan Receives Approval from British and American Public Opinion; If Japan Does Not Realize Its Errors, Active Measures Will Be Taken; Some Newspapers Feel Britain's Actions Are Too Late

(London) Following the release of the British government's note to Japan on the 14th of this month, the newspapers here have all given it positive reviews, expressing concern about the Japanese government's Far Eastern policy. Every newspaper reports that the note explicitly addresses Japan's efforts to force China into close political and economic cooperation with itself and its ally, "Manchukuo," and to permanently close the doors to foreign trade with the Far East. The scope of the note and the attitude it expresses are similar to the note submitted by the U.S. government on December 31st of last year. Britain is the largest investor in China, and the country with the most trade with China. The U.S. is the country with the most trade with China and the largest investor in China. There is ample reason for concern about Japan's attempt to establish a "New Order" in East Asia, which would turn China into a colony and severely exclude Western influence. Moreover, the Western powers' influence in China, its goals, and the methods used are all peaceful in nature, which is very different from Japan's invasion of China. Although Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bomb Chinese cities, the Chinese resistance is increasing rather than decreasing. The British government need not ask the Japanese government for permission to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese government. The construction of a highway between British Burma and Yunnan Province in China, and the loans provided by Britain and the U.S. to China on credit, show that China is still a great independent nation. The Conservative Daily Express states that "if Japan closes the doors of China to exclude our commerce, we can also close our doors to exclude Japanese commerce. According to the Congo Treaty concluded by Britain and Germany, Japanese cotton textiles imported into British colonies in East Africa enjoy the same treatment as British cotton textiles. Japan's actions in China have given us full rights to abolish this treaty. We should abolish it immediately so that the Lancashire cotton industry can regain the rights it deserves in the African market." According to well-informed sources, the British government's proposed plan is to prohibit the import of certain Japanese goods into Britain and to impose heavy taxes on other goods. This measure will be implemented not only in the United Kingdom but also in its non-self-governing colonies. The self-governing dominions are expected to take parallel actions. The Conservative Morning Post states that the note presented by the government yesterday is a timely and necessary response. It was reviewed by U.S. and French authorities before being sent to Japan. If Japan continues to act humbly on the surface but ignores the demands of other countries, then Britain, the U.S. and France may cooperate to retaliate against Japan. The implementation of this measure would involve punishing the existing puppet government. It is clear that the powers cannot recognize its qualifications to negotiate on Chinese affairs. The Daily Telegraph states that anyone who has studied the statements of Japanese officials and theorists welcomes the clarity of the wording of this decisive British note. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan had imposed some nominal restrictions on its war aims against China, but these original restrictions have long been abandoned, and their extent exceeds what was intended. The goal now is not only to destroy the National Government or reoccupy several provinces of China. Look at former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's statements in December. It would be unwise to believe that active Anglo-American action is impossible. (Reuters, 16th)

(London) Today's Manchester Guardian states that the only valid criticism of the British note to Japan is that it was sent too late. On the other hand, we should not forget that our public servants have rarely spoken so frankly in the past eight or nine years, which is commendable. If the British government continues to follow the U.S. government step by step, which is almost certain to happen, then we believe that Japan will pay due attention. This decisive American note is the first expression of President Roosevelt's support for democracy, and the first decisive indication that the British government will no longer continue to retreat before aggressors. The reaction to this note in Berlin and Rome will be no less than the joy in Tokyo, and the joy in Chongqing will be no less than in London and New York. The Morning Post comments that the meaning of the note can be summarized in one word: "Enough!" The note was sent after consultation with the U.S. and French governments. If Japan continues to act externally with outward respect and inwardly with deception, then Britain will likely cooperate with the U.S. to take retaliatory action. This action will likely involve imposing heavy taxes on Japanese goods, or even completely prohibiting the import of Japanese goods into Britain and its colonies. British businessmen will be overjoyed that the government is prepared to step in to prevent their interests from being completely destroyed. (Reuters, 16th)

(New York) The New York Herald Tribune commented today that Britain has become a follower of the United States. The New York Times also said that Japan is now facing a united Anglo-American front standing against its ideal of a "New Order." Washington's diplomatic circles responded to the British note by saying that Japan is now facing united opposition.

### Chinese Authorities Express Satisfaction

(Chongqing) When the reporter inquired about the opinion of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the British government's presentation of a note to the Japanese government on the 10th of January, the following reply was received: "The note sent by the British Ambassador to Japan to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 10th of January fully expresses the British government's solemn attitude towards Japan. It is not intimidated or deceived by the Japanese side's repeated attempts to create a puppet regime. The note states that the British side will adhere to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, refuse to recognize any situation created by the Japanese side through the use of force, and oppose the unilateral revision of the Nine-Power Treaty. Its position is completely consistent with the two notes presented by the United States to Japan on the 6th of October and the 31st of December of last year. As for its exposure of the fact that Konoe's statement of December 22nd regarding the lack of territorial ambitions and the respect for Chinese sovereignty is fundamentally incompatible with its demand for stationing troops in China and designating Inner Mongolia as a special anti-communist zone, it shows true insight. It is understood that the British side consulted with the U.S. government before sending this note. Thus, the policies of the United States, Britain, and France, the main signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, towards Japan have become unified. This is indeed a cause for celebration. Only when the United States, Britain, France, and other countries adopt a unified or parallel action can the aggression of Japan be effectively curbed, and the situation in the Far East stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty be maintained. (16th dispatch) [Referring to earlier discussion of imposition of high tariffs on Japanese goods, or even complete prohibition of Japanese goods entering Britain and its colonies,] a diplomatic correspondent from the Liberal Party's News Chronicle stated, "It is heard that the French government is preparing to send a similar note to Japan. Although the British note does not explicitly state that it will exert pressure on Japan financially and economically, it can be asserted that this aspect is under consideration by the government." At the same time, the newspaper published an editorial saying, "The value of this note has been greatly reduced because it was sent out so late. After the United States submitted its first note to Japan in October of last year, lodging a stern protest, it loaned China a large sum of 5,000,000 pounds. Britain could have adopted a parallel policy, but in practice, British policy and American policy are far apart." (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(London) The diplomatic correspondent of The Times recently commented on the British note to Japan, stating in brief that "the resistance caused by Japan's violation of other countries' rights is now gradually increasing. The meaning of the British document is clear. This was drafted before the outbreak of the Great War, and its wording has been approved by the French government. What is now undoubtedly clear is that even if Chiang Kai-shek's military operations are unsuccessful, Britain still recognizes him as the representative of China. On the other hand, the peace terms put forward by the Japanese army on the 22nd render the Nine-Power Treaty as waste paper. Now, Prime Minister Hiranuma has the opportunity to issue a more recent and satisfactory explanation. Hypothetically, Japan may not be able to correct its ambitions at this time. If so, then the British government's refusal to recognize the abolition of Chinese rights or the rights of other countries is justified. The Birmingham Post stated that this document is a major political document of the first order, containing no points of weakness and leaving no room for argument. This note regards the destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty as a direct injury to China, as well as a direct injury to the powers. This point makes people happy to read, and there are not many who can express it so appropriately and clearly on behalf of China. If Tokyo believes that Britain and the U.S. have not taken active action…"

### Japan Hesitates and Plans to Explain

(Tokyo) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to reporters today when asked about the British note, stating that the Japanese side is still studying the note and cannot comment on it, and that he cannot predict when a reply can be submitted. (Reuters, 16th)

(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun stated in its editorial today that the British International Document is nothing more than an expression of the opinions of the Eastern Shen Province, indicating that the British government cannot agree with the "New Order in East Asia" claimed by the Japanese government. Regarding this issue, the Japanese side has already explained in detail to the British and American ambassadors to Japan over the past two months. Therefore, the Japanese government does not intend to reply immediately to the British and American messages. Foreign Minister Arita will meet with the British and American ambassadors again at an appropriate time to provide a more detailed explanation, and then reply to the British and American sides at an appropriate time. It should be noted that the British government's attitude towards the revision of the Nine-Power Treaty seems to be related to the opinions of the Guan Zhiniu family of the birds, and it does not seem to be the time to collapse.

Editorial

### Chamberlain's Sorrow

Prime Minister Chamberlain has returned to London "looking utterly dejected." He joyfully accompanied Halifax to Rome, only to be rebuffed by Mussolini. For a year, Mussolini had received huge loans from London and had been granted recognition by Britain and France for the Italian Empire. Today, he is unwilling to make any concessions. During the Anglo-Italian talks, he resolutely stated his unwillingness to change his attitude towards France, to continue withdrawing Italian volunteer troops, and demanded unconditional recognition of the Spanish rebels as a belligerent party. In short, Mussolini clearly intends to rely on the assistance of his ally—Germany—and actively pursue his insatiable desires!

The breakdown of these Anglo-Italian talks is a major blow to Chamberlain's policy of "appeasement," which was long expected. Since the establishment of the Anglo-Italian Agreement last April, Prime Minister Chamberlain has done everything possible to promote a policy of "appeasing Europe"—but "appeasing Europe" is merely a beautiful guise. Its real purpose is to facilitate the conclusion of a Four-Power Pact between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, so that the aggressors' blades can be turned towards the Soviet Union. For this purpose, Chamberlain has spared no expense. Under the banner of "appeasement," Austria was annexed, Italy's illegal occupation of Abyssinia was recognized, and the legitimate government of Spain was blockaded. Czechoslovakia was carved up. In short, Chamberlain's "appeasement policy" reached its peak at the Munich Conference in October of last year. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement can be said to have created the rudimentary form of a Four-Power Pact.

However, we have repeatedly said that there is an unbridgeable divide between fascist states and democratic states. Due to the humiliating concessions of Britain and France, the Munich Agreement forcibly constituted the "Four-Power Pact" in rudimentary form. On the other hand, as the aggressive arrogance of German and Italian fascism grew daily, the Munich Agreement also deepened the contradictions between the four powers. According to Chamberlain's wishful thinking, he originally wanted to create a balance of power under British hegemony in order to stabilize Central and Eastern Europe, and turn the aggressor's blades towards the Soviet Union. But things did not go as planned. German and Italian fascists have become increasingly powerful with Chamberlain's support. Hitler is no longer a tool that London can arbitrarily dictate, but a wild horse that has broken free of its reins. Mussolini is also making exorbitant demands on France, demanding colonies. Not to mention that France has fallen into a position of isolation, but under the intense pressure of the Berlin-Rome axis, Britain's position is also considerably weakened and isolated. Facts have long shown that Chamberlain's "appeasement" policy is unworkable. But Chamberlain still obstinately sticks to his policy of indulging the aggressors. His visit to Rome was the final effort of his appeasement policy. Now that the Anglo-Italian talks have finally broken down, it should be a good lesson for Chamberlain.

Open your eyes and look at the treacherous storms brewing in Europe. The flames of the aggressors' war arrogance have burned sky-high, and are about to burn to Britain's very doorstep. As Mussolini provokes France, Hungary has joined the "Anti-Comintern Pact." Hitler is long prepared to attack Britain's colonies. If Britain does not abandon its "appeasement" policy of condoning aggression and stands up straight, it will surely feel deep regret in the future when it is "too late to mend the fold."

Mussolini has long said: "Cannons speak louder than words." It is clear that words have no binding effect on aggressors. When the Baldwin cabinet signed the Gentleman's Agreement with Italy in January 1935, British merchant ships were soon heavily attacked by fascist naval vessels in the Mediterranean. The Anglo-Italian Agreement of last April became a dead letter as soon as it was signed. All these facts have not taught Chamberlain a lesson. He is still groping around in the same circle, not knowing how to make the count. Will he succeed?

Meeting force with force, and striking the aggressor in return, is the only effective way to stop fascist aggression!

### Chinese Troops Counterattack Guangzhou: Military Arrangements Completed; Japanese Troops Attempt to Invade Guangxi via the West River: Guangdong Northern Troops Prepare to Intercept; Southern Shanxi Troops Recapture Fenglingdu

(Hong Kong) Observers state that, judging from the Japanese army's recent series of movements, they seem to be planning to invade Guangxi via the West River. Japanese troops have already arrived in Sanshui and southwest areas, their aim being to scout Wuzhou or land at Beihai. While the actual strength of the Chinese troops within Guangdong province is not clear, since there are no battles on the Yangtze River, their navy can be mobilized to the greatest extent. Therefore, there is a strong possibility of a landing at Beihai. Bai Chongxi has returned to Guilin to coordinate everything. Coupled with the steep mountains of Guangxi, the determination of regular troops and militia to defend the country, the Japanese army will face significant difficulties if they advance westward. At the same time, the Chinese troops in northern Guangdong are prepared to launch a large-scale southward advance when the Japanese troops move westward, cutting off their transportation lines. The reason for not counterattacking yet is based on military considerations. Zhang Fakui, Li Hanhun, Ye Zhao, and Wu Qiwu have all arrived in northern Guangdong, and military arrangements for the southward attack have been completed. In the future, when the counterattack is launched, the Chinese air force will also participate, but its strength has not been announced. (Special dispatch, 12:00 PM on the 16th)

(Changsha) A reporter spoke to the person in charge of the provincial government yesterday, who said that after the Changsha fire, Chairman Zhang felt deeply guilty for his oversight in employing the wrong people and neglecting defense. He immediately requested punishment and was ordered by the central government to be dismissed but retained to take responsibility for the aftermath. In the past two months, the temporary relief work for the fire has been successfully completed. The Executive Yuan sent a telegram to commend the provincial government a few days ago. In the meantime, the provincial government convened a meeting of commissioners, district commanders, and county magistrates throughout the province, formulated and promulgated emergency response plans for local governments at all levels, and convened a Xiangxi security conference, setting a three-month deadline to eradicate banditry. Chairman Zhang also personally inspected various places. After returning, he expressed that the people of the entire province are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about the War of Resistance, and the military and civilians are harmonious. Chairman Zhang believes that the fire relief and emergency wartime administrative measures have come to an end. On the 30th of last month, he formally telegraphed the central government to resign, requesting the appointment of a capable successor and hoping for an early approval. However, before the reorganization order is officially promulgated, Chairman Zhang will fulfill his duty one day at a time, thoroughly implementing the purpose of serving the thirty million people until the end. Zhang's original telegram of resignation, which is recorded as follows: Extremely urgent, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission, and President Kong of the Executive Yuan: Confidential, After the Changsha fire, with a guilty conscience, I was ordered to be dismissed but retained to take responsibility for the aftermath, trying my best to make amends until today. Now that temporary relief has come to an end, reconstruction must wait until after the war. I am ashamed to remain in my post and bear the trust, and I feel deeply pained in my heart. I only implore you to approve my dismissal and appoint a capable successor. From now on, for the rest of my life, I will devote myself to loyalty and seek to repay your favor. I hope you will appreciate my sincere feelings and grant your approval as soon as possible. I am extremely grateful and await your orders. Your subordinate, Zhang Zhizhong, bows.

### Japanese Troops in Northern Hunan Are Quite Busy Mobilizing

(Changsha) Between Puqi and Yueyang in northern Hunan, Japanese troop transport is continuous. In the Chongyang-Tongcheng area, Japanese troop mobilization is also frequent. This may be a sign that a major battle is about to break out again on the northern Hunan front. According to the observations of Chinese military experts, in the future, the Japanese army may use all its strength to invade southward along the Yuehan Railway from Yueyang. The Xiang-E Highway, due to the overlapping peaks of Jiuling and its dangerous terrain, will be taken with a feigned attack to contain the Chinese army's strength.

### British Foreign Secretary Notifies French Foreign Minister: Rome Talks Not Bad; Italy Guarantees No Ambitions in Spain; France Regrets Failure of French-Italian Talks

(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Bonnet arrived here this evening and immediately had dinner with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax for talks. According to informed sources, Foreign Secretary Halifax informed Foreign Minister Bonnet that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had reiterated to the British Cabinet members that as soon as the Spanish Nationalist forces achieved final victory, Italian troops would withdraw from the Spanish mainland and the Balearic Islands. This guarantee from the Italian Prime Minister had been communicated to French Prime Minister Daladier by the British Ambassador to France, Sir Phipps. Both Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet expressed their satisfaction upon hearing this. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax also informed Foreign Minister Bonnet that the British Cabinet members had avoided discussing the disputes between Italy and France, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had not put forward any concrete demands, only explaining the position taken by Italy, which was listened to by the British Cabinet members. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

(Geneva) During his dinner with French Foreign Minister Bonnet this evening, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax reported on the talks with the Italian Cabinet members. Prime Minister Chamberlain obtained the consent of the Italian authorities to issue a statement to the British House of Commons, stating this matter. In addition, no part of Spanish territory, whether islands or colonies, would be governed by Italy. Prime Minister Mussolini also guaranteed that he would no longer send fresh troops to the Spanish Nationalist government forces. He also expressed regret over the news that France had supplied the Spanish Republican government with armaments, as rumored abroad. Regarding the dispute between Italy and France, the Italian Prime Minister did not make any concrete demands on France, only stating that the Italian government had intended to negotiate with France when it announced the cancellation of the Italian-French Agreement on December 26 last year, but France had not accepted it, which was regrettable. The British Cabinet members immediately explained that the atmosphere at that time was not conducive to negotiations, and if Italian anti-French propaganda could be stopped, the French government would also be happy to do so. In short, the Italian Prime Minister did not ask Britain to mediate or arbitrate. The British Cabinet members also kept their previous promises, avoiding interference on fundamental issues. Regarding the relationship between Italy and Germany, Prime Minister Mussolini did not make any special statements, but expressed his hope that the arms race could be limited and that international economic relations could be improved.

### Chamberlain Returns to London, Continues Policy of Appeasement, British and Italian Views Clarified, Still Must Intensify Strengthening of National Defense

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to London this afternoon. No fewer than several thousand people gathered at the train station to cheer and pay their respects. The Prime Minister still carried his "historic" umbrella, decorated with a pink flower, and smiled. After disembarking from the train, he spoke a few words to the welcoming crowd and then drove straight back to his official residence at No. 10 Downing Street. Crowds lined the streets, expressing their respect. There were also those who shouted "Rise up, Red Party!" and "Do not invade Spain!", and two people were arrested for being insulting. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately informed Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon of the situation of the British-Italian talks, and at the Cabinet meeting on the 18th of this month, he submitted a detailed report. According to people close to the government, the Prime Minister is determined to continue to pursue a policy of appeasement at all costs. He has gained a clear understanding of the views of the Italian authorities after his talks with them. In short, Italy is currently concerned with many issues: 1. Demands for French-administered Djibouti and other territories of France; 2. Participation in the management of the Suez Canal; 3. Demarcation of the border between British Somaliland, British Egypt, the Sudanese border and Italian East Africa; 4. The evolution of the Spanish civil war. None of these issues involve the interests of Britain's survival. After the talks between the British and Italian Cabinet members, the friendship between the two sides has increased, and it is possible that some of these issues may be easier to resolve. However, the result of the British-Italian talks is purely of a passive nature, which is the reality. Therefore, intensifying the strengthening of national defense is the most concerning thing for the British government in the future. This can be asserted with certainty. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

### Mussolini Publishes Article, Not Necessary to Be Overly Pessimistic, Nor Too Optimistic

(Rome) The semi-official magazine "Diplomatic News" recently published a commentary on the talks between the British and Italian Cabinet members, which it said was obtained from responsible sources. According to the report, Prime Minister Mussolini told the British Cabinet members that once the "Red and Black" troops had been completely withdrawn from Spain and the Nationalist forces enjoyed the rights of belligerent groups, the Italian troops would withdraw from both Spain. However, if any government friendly to our Republican government were to engage in large-scale intervention, causing the non-intervention policy to be changed, then Italy would also reconsider its attitude and restore its freedom of action. Regarding the dispute between Italy and France, Prime Minister Mussolini said that Italy and France have deep differences of opinion on the Spanish issue, and a solution may be considered after the end of the Spanish civil war. From now until that time, whether to convene a three-nation conference or a four-nation conference, to mediate or arbitrate, would be futile. Based on this, the rumors circulating abroad that Italy is asking Britain to mediate are purely fabricated and extremely absurd. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned the close relations between Britain and Germany, and Prime Minister Mussolini stated that Italy's foreign policy is still based on the Rome-Berlin Axis. As for the relations between Britain and Italy, the British-Italian Agreement has been faithfully implemented by both countries, so there are no alarming issues to be discussed regarding the relations between the two countries. The British and Italian Cabinet members also discussed the possibility of the Jewish refugee issue and the limitation of armaments. The latter is still far from being realized. The conclusion stated: "According to responsible sources, after the talks between the British and Italian Cabinet members, neither excessive pessimism nor excessive optimism is appropriate. Everyone must always trust those who have good intentions to continue working to satisfy the legitimate needs of all nations, so as to stabilize peace in Europe." (Havas dispatch on the 19th)

(London) The semi-official "Diplomatic News" report on the talks between the British and Italian Cabinet members in Rome, which was said to have been written by Prime Minister Mussolini, was recently explained by a person familiar with the inside story: The evolution of Italian-German relations depends on whether the Spanish civil war can be resolved according to Germany's wishes. According to Italian sources, this commentary is a warning to a certain country not to provide large-scale assistance to the Spanish Republican government in the "last hour," otherwise Italy will also restore its freedom of action and be unwilling to intervene, so that the Nationalist forces can obtain final victory.

### Chamberlain Thanks Mussolini by Telegram

(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain has telegraphed Mussolini, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome he received in Italy. The telegram stated: "Upon my return, my confidence in British-Italian friendship and our mutual hope to maintain peace has been strengthened." Mussolini telegraphed back, saying, "I am happy to reiterate that Your Excellency and Lord Halifax's visit to Rome has proven that British-Italian friendship is resolved and that I believe in upholding justice and maintaining peace." British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also exchanged telegrams, with similar wording to those of Chamberlain and Mussolini. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

### Daladier Announces Policy of Peace and National Defense, Willing to Negotiate with Italy, Radical Party Expresses Confidence

(Paris) The executive committees of the Radical Socialist Party's members of parliament, and leaders of branches everywhere held a joint meeting here this month. Prime Minister Daladier, who is also the party leader, delivered a speech, appealing for national unity to cope with foreign crises and defend the integrity of the colonial empire. The representatives then unanimously passed a resolution expressing confidence in the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's speech and the resolutions of the joint meeting are detailed below: (1) Prime Minister Daladier said, "For more than ten months, the government has had to fight against malicious people within the country and deal with external difficulties. Whenever the government's position is threatened or weakened internally, external crises expand accordingly. Fortunately, in these ten months, we have been able to overcome internal disturbances and reunite the national strength, thereby showing the world our determination. However, this situation cannot be allowed to continue unchanged. The crisis and difficulties in Italy and Germany are just beginning. The government has the authority to require the people to end internal political disputes to protect the interests and integrity of the country and its colonial territories. The government has decided to do everything possible to prevent major disasters from breaking out and to prevent Western civilization from being destroyed. But we cannot tolerate the forcible or cunning seizure of France's current position and interests." In short, the government's foreign policy is a "policy of peace and national defense." As for domestic affairs, the Popular Front, originally a set of negotiated terms between the working class and the propertied class, has caused much friction because the propertied class believes it has been sacrificed. It should be known that if the middle class in a country feels disappointed, it is not beneficial to the country. The cases of Germany and Italy can serve as a lesson. It is always necessary to do everything possible to avoid social unrest. The lesson is always the same. Even though the trade unions launched a general strike on November 30 last year, Italy began to express its opposition on that day. If the general strike had not been stopped in time, the impact would have been unimaginable." After the Prime Minister finished speaking, the Socialist Senator and foreign affairs expert, Mr. Berto, expressed his sympathy for the government's current policy and urged the government, after consulting with the British, to take all appropriate measures to deal with the threat from Italy. "If Italy were to occupy the Spanish Balearic Islands and threaten the traffic of the French mainland and its North African territories, the colonial empire would be finished." (2) The joint meeting then unanimously passed a resolution with eight points, namely: 1. To commend the firm and compromising policy pursued by Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. The goal of this policy is to maintain peace while not abandoning national interests. 2. To express regret that the major countries have failed to heed public opinion and establish a general agreement. 3. Regarding the French-Italian issue, France can negotiate with Italy if the general atmosphere improves, but on the condition that territorial concessions are not involved. 4. To urge the government to pay attention to the situation caused by Italy's interference in the Spanish civil war and its occupation of Spanish territory and the Balearic Islands. 5. Regarding domestic affairs, the joint meeting passed two resolutions, one expressing trust in the government's actions and urging the people to unite to support the government, and the other advocating the revision of the electoral system.

### British Labour Leader Criticizes Prime Minister, Believes in Over-Reliance on Dictators

Westminster. Major Clement Attlee, leader of the British opposition Labour Party, delivered a speech here this afternoon criticizing Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's trip to Rome, stating that the Prime Minister's trip achieved nothing. "Since the Prime Minister returned from Munich in September of last year, he has stated that he believes Hitler has good intentions, but advocating for increased armaments is inherently contradictory. Since returning from Rome, he says he deeply believes in the sincerity of the Italian government. Considering what Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has done in the past, we find it difficult to trust his promises. Taking the Spanish Civil War as an example, Italy consistently spoke of a non-intervention policy, while simultaneously actively intervening. Now, Italian newspapers are freely criticizing France, and French troops are concentrated in East Africa at Barr el Murri and Lugh Ferrandi. The British people have the right to demand that the government inform them of the truth of the situation. The truth is that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler are pursuing an aggressive policy in Europe. The British people welcome good relations with the German and Italian people, but it is impossible to ignore reality and insist that the other side is sincere. There is a country whose army is attacking British merchant ships, bombing British sailors, and killing workers and children without remorse. The British Prime Minister personally went to visit. This is not appropriate for British interests or world peace," he said. (Havas, 15th)

### Catalonia Front: Government Troops in General Retreat, Nationalist Troops Enter Barcelona Province, 35 Miles from Provincial Capital

Barcelona. The Republican government's Ministry of National Defense recently issued a communique stating that the Catalan autonomous region's front-line troops were ordered by the commander-in-chief today to retreat voluntarily to Tarragona to defend the important positions east of Valls and Tarragona. (Havas, 15th)

Barcelona. Government troops have retreated entirely from the front line of the Catalan autonomous region to defend new positions. The situation is very good. All weapons were taken away and there were no major losses. The local communists distributed leaflets, demanding that all residents be incorporated into the military authorities to defend Catalonia with all their might. (Havas, 16th)

Lérida. According to a Havas correspondent in Tarragona, Nationalist troops captured Tarragona today using an encirclement tactic. Their vanguard reached the Gaià River and then attacked Tarragona. Another unit detoured to the north to encircle the city. Government troops could not withstand the attack and retreated while fighting. The Nationalist mechanized units rushed into the city at 12:30 PM. By 2 PM, they had completely occupied the city. Among the residents who did not flee, there were more than 10,000 elderly, weak, women, and children. (Havas, 15th)

San Sebastián de los Reyes. The Nationalist Army Headquarters recently issued a battle report stating, "Our troops in Catalonia captured the important towns of Tarragona and Reus this afternoon, as well as 82 nearby villages. The vanguard has already advanced to the Gaià River, only 60 kilometers from Barcelona. The area occupied by our troops totals 1,650 square kilometers. Since the start of the general offensive in late December of last year, our troops have occupied 7,225 square kilometers of land on the Catalan front." Tarragona is located on the Mediterranean coast, 70 kilometers from Barcelona, and is strategically important. In addition, a Nationalist detachment invaded Barcelona province near Coloma yesterday. (Havas, 15th)

Lérida. The Nationalist Navarre Fifth Brigade has entered Tarragona. At the same time, General Yagüe's headquarters announced that the Nationalist forces have completely occupied Tarragona and Reus. Another Nationalist force has advanced to the Gaià River. It is reported that the Nationalist force on the road north of Barcelona has entered the province of Barcelona near Coloma, only 35 miles from Barcelona. (Reuters, 16th)

Madrid. At dawn yesterday, government troops took the offensive along the Tagus River, driving Nationalist troops from a certain village on the north bank. Another government force crossed the river near a village 25 miles from Toledo. According to semi-official sources, government troops have continued to make progress on the Extremadura front near Badajoz, capturing Ovidiuona and other places, and advancing to the vicinity of Hervás. Government troops also repelled a Nationalist counter-attack in the Rubielos de Mora area further north. (Reuters, 16th)

### Hiranuma Kiichirō Elaborates on Benevolent Rule, Does Not Require Totalitarianism

(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma stated on the train yesterday that Japan does not desire nor need to implement totalitarianism. Totalitarianism and individualism have long been integrated into benevolent rule and have become the guiding principle of Japanese politics. The term "benevolent rule" was advocated by Emperor Meiji. Japanese politicians must adhere to it when conducting domestic and foreign policy. Therefore, Japanese politics must be rooted in benevolent rule. If everyone follows benevolent rule and supports the Imperial Family, the nation will be united and stability will be achieved. The Prime Minister then criticized political parties, stating that he must ensure that Japanese political parties are based on benevolent rule, unite with the nation, and loyally support the Imperial Family. Japanese political parties are different from Western political parties. Western political parties arise from conflicts of interest. Japanese political parties must have the welfare of the Imperial Family at heart. Therefore, those who abandon righteousness for profit must be severely condemned. The Prime Minister frankly admitted that he intended to organize a new political organization. (Reuters, 16th)

(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma has requested the resignation of the entire cabinet of the new cabinet organization, but has retained all the councilors. These include former Speaker of the House of Representatives Akita, President of the South Manchuria Railway Company Matsuoka, President of the Seiyūkai party Hatoyama, President of the North China Development Company Ayukawa, and the President of the Japan Economic Federation. The current Minister of Home Affairs, Suetsugu, has accepted the position of cabinet councilor. The government is now also asking former Minister of Finance Ikeda to serve as a cabinet councilor. (Reuters, 16th)

(Tokyo) Konoe's appointment as President of the Privy Council and Minister without Portfolio in the government has caused great discussion in government and political circles. The Privy Council Ordinance clearly stipulates that members of the Privy Council may not interfere in government administrative matters. Therefore, there is speculation that Konoe has no specifically designated administrative affairs to handle, but he can be summoned to the Diet to answer questions. Political circles here believe that if Konoe actually attends the Diet, he will attend as Minister without Portfolio, so that his attendance will not violate the Privy Council Ordinance. (Reuters, 16th)

### Japanese Trade Declines, Imports and Exports Both Decrease by 21.2 Percent

(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Finance, Japan's overseas trade in 1938 had a surplus of 60,498,000 yen (compared to a deficit of 35,906,000 yen in 1937). Exports from Japan proper, Korea, Taiwan, and mandated territories amounted to 2,896,707,000 yen, while imports amounted to 2,836,209,000 yen, totaling 5,732,916,000 yen. Compared with 1937, exports decreased by 12.7 percent, imports decreased by 28.3 percent, and both items together decreased by 1,540,630,000 yen, or 21.2 percent. In the past few years, Japan had been working hard to expand its overseas textile market. However, since the establishment of the wartime economic structure in the second half of 1937 and the implementation of strict controls on overseas trade, the situation has changed drastically. As a result, textile exports have been declining since the beginning of last year, with cotton products being the most affected. Their total exports were 40,239,000 yen, a decrease of 168,826,000 yen compared to 1937. However, exports of machinery and paper have increased. Exports of food, such as flour and canned goods, have also been very strong. The former were transported to countries allied with Japan, while the latter were marketed in Europe. In addition, exports of canned seafood have also increased. Raw material exports have fallen sharply, totaling 669,963,000 yen, a decrease of 144,628,000 yen compared to 1937. The main reason is the sharp decline in exports of raw silk and rayon. The total value of Japan's two largest exports, cotton textiles and raw silk, was 768,363,000 yen, accounting for 25 percent of Japan's total exports. The total export value of these two items decreased by 211,820,000 yen compared to the previous year, accounting for nearly half of the total export decrease in 1937, which dealt a major blow to Japan's overseas trade. Japan's imports have also fallen sharply. The main reason is the sharp decrease in the two major import items, raw cotton and wool. In 1938, the total import value of these two items was 331,262,000 yen. Although the government wanted to reduce imports of other items, it failed to achieve the desired effect. However, the actual decrease in the above attached items was considered satisfactory. Imports of leather, rubber, lumber, and other less important items have also decreased significantly. Trading merchants believe that the trade controls required for the war with China have resulted in the loss of many transactions. The slight import surplus mentioned above was first seen since 1918, but it actually included trade with countries allied with Japan and had nothing to do with foreign currencies. If we consider the import surplus actually obtained from trade with third countries, the amount is only 850,000,000 yen. (Reuters, 16th)

"Caporetto"

Paris. The street nameplates in the capital city that resembled those of cities in Italy were dismantled by a large crowd last night and replaced with square pieces of white paper bearing the word "Caporetto." The "Roma" station of the underground railway was also renamed "Caporetto." The Public Works Bureau sent people to tear off these pieces of white paper today, explaining that "Caporetto was originally part of Austria-Hungary before the European War. After the war, it was assigned to Italy. The German-Austrian forces heavily defeated the Italian army there on October 24, 1917." (Havas, 15th)

The agenda includes the China issue. It is expected that the British Foreign Secretary will hold a secret meeting with Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun before departing for London tonight. However, the most important issue to be discussed publicly today is the Spanish situation.

(Reuters, 16th)

Marseille. Dr. Larnaud, a member of the French Academy of Medicine, who was sent to China by the League of Nations in December of the year before last as the leader of a mobile medical team (the League of Nations dispatched a total of three mobile medical teams to serve in various parts of China), specializing in providing medical care and assistance in southern China, returned to this city from South China today aboard the postal ship "Compiegne." According to him, he opened many hospitals in South China and recruited necessary personnel.

### Chiang Kai-shek Replies to Tan Kah Kee, The National Policy of Resistance Will Not Change, Hopes Overseas Chinese Will Unite to Exert Efforts and Support; Wang Jingwei Has Already Been dealt with and Announcement Made

Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the South Seas China Relief Fund, urgently telegraphed the Chongqing Chairman Chiang regarding reports of Wang Jingwei's treacherous declaration, announcing Wang's crimes and requesting that he be apprehended and brought to justice to rectify the country. Chairman Chiang replied, stating that resistance is the established national policy and will not change. He hopes that the overseas Chinese will unite, exert efforts, and provide support. The full text of the original telegram is transcribed below:

1.  Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram: To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, disregarding disgrace, openly agrees with the Japanese bandits' conditions for the subjugation of the country. His actions are not only a traitor to the Premier but also a national traitor to the Chinese nation. Your Lushan declaration, resisting to the end, has been supported by the whole country and has become an ironclad case of resistance to Japan. Compromise midway is tantamount to destruction. Jingwei deeply knows this meaning. The recent resolution of the National Political Council states that civil servants who advocate for peace midway are traitors. As the Speaker of the Council, how could he have turned a deaf ear? He dared to abandon his post and leave the capital, betraying the party and the country, as if saying that the puppet regime in Nanjing has a high seat reserved for him, and no one else is worthy? If this is not punished, how can we encourage the people and how can we eradicate the effects? We respectfully request that you announce his crimes and issue an arrest warrant to bring him to justice, rectify the national laws, and stabilize the hearts of the people. The millions of overseas Chinese support resistance to the end. Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief Fund for Refugees of the National Crisis, respectfully kowtows (31st day).

2.  Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's reply: To Mr. Chen Jiageng, your telegram has been received. The Central Government has already taken action and an announcement has been made, which you should have already read. We must strive for the victory of resistance and the integrity of national sovereignty and territory. This is the established national policy and will not change. I hope you will convey this to the overseas Chinese, and that they will unite, exert efforts, and provide support. Chiang Zhongzheng (4th day), Secretarial Seal in Chongqing.

Chongqing. Anhui Chairman Liao Lei, Hunan Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, and Xikang Chairman Liu Wenhui, together with other generals, telegraphed the government, supporting the government's decision to expel Wang Jingwei. (Reuters, 16th)

### Fighting Near Yingcheng and Zao City

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, fighting took place yesterday northwest of Yingcheng and southwest of Zao City on the Hanyi Highway. In recent days, Japanese planes have been constantly flying over Chinese army positions to reconnoiter and drop bombs. The Japanese troops in Yingcheng are continuously moving westward, seemingly with the intention of advancing westward. (Express News Agency, 16th)

### Most of Japanese Troops in Tongcheng Withdraw Northward

Pingjiang. Most of the Japanese troops stationed in Tongcheng have withdrawn northward. There are only about 300 Japanese troops left in the city. In recent days, Chinese guerrilla teams have been constantly attacking and sweeping, and Japanese aid lines of communication and communication networks have been cut off from time to time. Small groups of Japanese troops have also been annihilated from time to time. Therefore, the Japanese troops in the city have been closing the city gates all day long, not daring to go out.

### Chairman Lin's Report at the Joint Memorial Week: Firm Belief, First Eliminate the Psychology of Doubt

(Chongqing) The Central National Government held a joint memorial week for the Premier on the morning of the 16th. More than 500 members of the Central Committee, heads of various ministries, and senior officials attended. The ceremony was conducted as usual, and Chairman Lin reported on "Firm Belief, First Eliminate the Psychology of Doubt." It has been exactly one year and six months since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. In this year and a half of the sacred war of resistance, the enemy has forcibly occupied many of our transportation areas, massacred countless of our compatriots, and sacrificed and plundered our countless properties and fortunes. Such a vicious method is still continuing to invade us under the fierce and brutal command of the enemy. How should we recognize this unprecedentedly serious situation, how should we establish our strong will, endure this bitterness, work harder, and fight the violent Japanese to the end, so as to recover our lost territory and sovereignty and protect the permanent life of our nation? Now that the War of Resistance has entered the second stage, psychological construction is very important. Although the psychology of the majority of the soldiers and people of the country is as firm as gold and stone, there are still a very small number of people who do not have a clear understanding and whose will is not firm, who may have doubts about the future of the War of Resistance. Because doubt will shake their belief. Today, I specially put forward this topic (Firm Belief, First Eliminate the Psychology of Doubt) to contribute some ideas to everyone. Estimating the enemy's strength too high and the international assistance received is not much. This is the doubt psychology that is easily developed by those with "fear of Japan." Now I will explain the actual situation that I have investigated clearly from all aspects to correct their wrong ideas. (To be continued)

### Japanese Army in North China Suppressing British and French Concessions in Tianjin; Forcing Japanese Merchants Within Both Concessions to Withdraw; Tianjin's Future Depends on European Events

The "North China Daily News" reports: Yesterday (the 10th), according to a foreign resident arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin, since occupying Tianjin, the Japanese army has been restricting British and other foreign commercial activities. Japanese merchants in Tianjin are in a state of panic over the order issued by their military authorities requiring all Japanese residents to withdraw from the British and French concessions, as this move will cause them significant economic losses. Although the Japanese military authorities issued this order a month ago, they immediately discovered that the order could not be implemented as easily as initially anticipated. Currently, major Japanese commercial entities such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line), and Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK Lines) all possess valuable buildings and properties within the "restricted" area. Although it is said that their offices will have to relocate by the end of this month, they remain within the concessions for now and have not moved. At the same time, roads connecting the concessions to the outside world have been barricaded by the Japanese military authorities, but commerce within the concessions continues as usual. The original intention of the Japanese was to isolate the two concessions in Tianjin and then order the Japanese residents to withdraw. However, no decisive action has been taken to achieve this goal. After the Japanese military authorities issued the order, Japanese businesses with valuable properties within the two concessions are indeed facing losses upon withdrawal. After leaving the concessions, their properties will naturally be of no use to them. Currently, smaller Japanese businesses and individually operated Japanese merchants have already withdrawn from the concessions. If the Japanese residents can completely withdraw, unless the Japanese can prevent foreign ships from reaching the rivers along the British and French concessions, this would be akin to disregarding the goose and cutting off its nose. If the Japanese want to prevent foreign ships from sailing to Tianjin and cut off this trade route, it cannot be done without force. The commercial situation in the concessions is not as bleak as the Japanese portray it, but foreign businesses have undoubtedly suffered losses after the Japanese implemented restrictions. This is most evident in the export of general goods. However, the Japanese are transporting a large amount of salt, coal, and iron ore to Japan, with Japanese ships accounting for 70% of the transportation, and the rest being transported by British and other foreign ships. Last year, imports were quite sluggish, but this year, a large number of American and Australian goods are expected to be imported. Maritime trade between Tianjin and South China has been cut off since the fall of Guangzhou, but trade with Shantou seems to be flourishing. The nature of Japanese goods being imported cannot be determined due to the lack of records. Although most Japanese goods should be subject to customs duties, the Japanese often claim they are importing military supplies. The Japanese authorities had stated their intention to move the Tianjin Customs from the French concession to the Japanese concession, but according to the latest information, the Tianjin Customs remains in the French concession. A branch office will be set up in the former German concession, and goods imported from the guerrilla areas will be handled by this branch office. Barricades have been erected at the borders of the British and French concessions. Foreign residents passing through are required to display transit passes or identification documents, which is somewhat inconvenient. As for the Chinese, the restrictions are stricter. Pedestrians, rickshaw drivers, and other forms of transport are all subject to inspection, causing severe traffic congestion. The journey to the train station via the Wan Guo Bridge is often delayed due to traffic congestion caused by inspections at the bridgehead. One method the Japanese are using to suppress British trade in Tianjin is to subject all foreign ships entering Tianjin to medical inspections, often causing indefinite delays to British ships. However, this is still not as severe as the detention of ships in Qingdao. Carts carrying vegetables and food are allowed to pass through the barricades, so although the price of food in the concessions has increased significantly, there is certainly no shortage. The Japanese often claim that Chinese terrorists are hiding in the British and French concessions, which is not true. There have been several bombing incidents in the two concessions, but investigations by the police have confirmed that the bombers were not acting on the instructions of the Chinese authorities. On the other hand, several fires and bombings have occurred in the Japanese concession, but no clues have been found. The Japanese restrictions began to be implemented during the European crisis, so the foreign resident believes that the Japanese intend to seize the two concessions in the event of war in Europe. Once the European crisis ends, the situation in Tianjin will also improve. Therefore, the future of Tianjin depends on European events. If Germany becomes isolated in Europe, the situation in Tianjin will change completely. Tianjin and Shanghai are not comparable, the Japanese are restricting foreigners alike, but the people are doing their best to cope with it.

### Guangzhou Under Japanese Occupation: Bandits Openly Sell Stolen Goods; British and French Trading Firms in Shamian Close Down

Guangzhou correspondence: The East River, West River and North River areas of Guangdong Province have not yet entered a stage of intense warfare. However, Chinese guerrilla troops are active in various villages. This type of mobile warfare does not seem to have had a significant impact on the situation in Guangzhou. As a result, the Japanese have been actively attempting to restore order in the occupied areas in recent months, seeking to revitalize the market and collect taxes. However, after several attempts, only three or four districts within the city of Guangzhou are somewhat populated. The First Ford in Xiguan is the most prosperous of these districts. The general poor people and hawkers and coolies gather here, and most of them sell daily necessities here. Small shops such as butcher shops, low-grade restaurants, beef noodle shops, vegetable stalls, and antique shops all open early in the morning. The First Ford street has now become a market for the poor, and the hawkers form a team every day and venture to nearby villages to collect pigs, cattle, fish and vegetables for demand and the profits are doubled. For example, a type of fresh fish purchased for 20 cents per catty in Pingzhou Township, Nanhai County, can be sold for 40 cents per catty when shouldered to Guangzhou. There is even more profit to be made from other pigs and cattle. Therefore, before dawn every day, one can see these hawkers in an endless stream on the road from Pingzhou to Baihedong Township. In addition to the First Ford Market in Guangzhou, there is also Longjin Road in Upper Xiguan. On both sides of this road, the sidewalks are lined with vegetable and miscellaneous stalls during the morning and evening market periods. In the desolate city of Guangzhou, it can also be called a bustling market. This place has already become a food supply hub for the area of Lower Xiguan. As for the markets in the city, Huifu West Road and Zhonghua Middle Road are currently the most densely populated, because many handicraft districts are nearby. Woodworkers, toothbrush workers, and jade carvers all live in this area. Most of these people were unable to move away when Guangzhou fell, so fewer of their residences were looted. When the Japanese troops entered the city, the entire city was looted, and the stolen goods were piled up by bandits on Huifu West Road and Zhonghua Middle Road, and sold at low prices, which was heartbreaking. Generally, people with frozen blood took advantage of the cheap price and openly bought them and resold them in various villages to make huge profits. The Japanese army often indirectly protects the bandits, which further fuels their desire to steal and plunder. The fact that thefts occur in Guangzhou every night is a major reason for this. Recently, the Japanese puppets have organized the street self-defense groups into temporary police, paying them a few cents a day to maintain law and order. However, it is just a name and not reality, and the locations where there are police are limited to slightly more prosperous areas. In addition, law and order in other areas is still chaotic. More than two months have passed since the fall of Guangzhou. In the occupied areas, people are cut off from the outside world. Those who communicate with Hong Kong and Macau must send them by special messengers at great expense. In order to attract citizens back to the cloth shop, the Japanese are now restoring the post office and setting up an office in a certain cinema in Xidi (the original Guangdong Postal Administration Bureau has been burned down), so Guangzhou and Hong Kong and Macao can be reached in three days. The city is not as isolated as it used to be.

As for the shipping between the province and Hong Kong, it has not yet been restored. Those who come to and from the province and Hong Kong must take the route through Macau, Qianshan, Jiangmen, Shunde, and to Pingzhou, Nanhai County. However, to follow the land to Henan and cross the river to enter the city requires three or four days one way, and a round trip is not possible in a week. Yesterday, it was reported that the Hong Kong government has agreed with the Japanese to resume shipping between the province and Hong Kong. Three days ago, the Jinshan ship first went to Guangzhou to explore the waterway. If there are no obstacles, British commercial ships will resume sailing between the province and Hong Kong in the future. But whether it can be put into practice is still a problem. The Japanese do not really intend to open the Pearl River waterway, but intend to use this to undermine the interests of European countries in South China, and take the opportunity to restore Japan's commercial market in South China. The Shamian Concession is originally within the sphere of influence of Britain and France. Now that business in Guangzhou has completely stopped, the British business lines in Shamian have also closed down. Only the Japanese business lines in the British Concession are booming. Japanese merchants are swinging among them, and they are very proud of themselves. Taiwan Bank, Mitsui Bank, and Japanese transport companies have reopened their doors one after another. There was originally a Chinese Telegraph Bureau in Shamian. Now the Japanese are trying to force the bureau to move to the inland, but there is no way to do it. There are few British residents in Shemian, except for the staff of the consulate. On the contrary, Japanese people are constantly coming and going. In this situation, the Japanese in the British and French concessions in Shamian are very likely to make a riot and seize power. Therefore, Britain has recently repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities, demanding to open the Pearl River waterway and plan to revive British commerce in South China. (January 10th)

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Opens Zhejiang-Guangxi Through Train; First Train Departed on the 9th and Arrived in Guilin on the 13th

Jinhua correspondence: The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the only complete railway after the war of resistance, and it is now a transportation artery that inland passengers and goods are accustomed to. Now, in order to facilitate passenger and freight transportation, the road is actively preparing for the opening of the Zhejiang-Guangxi Joint Transportation Train. The train has been scheduled to depart from Jinhua at 12:00 AM on the morning of the 9th to Guilin. The passengers were quite crowded. It is planned to attach seven vehicles, including first and second class, second class, third class, sleeper car and dining car. Except for a short stop at major stations along the way, it will drive straight to Guangxi Province. It is expected to arrive at Guilin Station at 9:30 AM on the 13th, which will take a total of 80 hours. Ordinary passenger tickets are sold for 22 yuan, eight jiao and five fen. Two trains will be run every week thereafter, on Mondays and Fridays. Those who leave Guilin to Zhejiang will depart from Guilin at 19:00 and arrive in Jin four days later at 2:20 PM. The scheduled departure dates are twice on Wednesdays and Sundays.

### Japanese Army Fully Occupies Ports in Tongzhou and Rugao, Monopolizing Shipping Industry

Rugao correspondence: Since the fall of Tongzhou and Rugao, the ports of Xinsheng, Zhanghuang, and Tiansheng have all been occupied by the Japanese army. However, merchants are allowed to enter and exit the ports of Niantuo, Xiaoli, and Siyu, which are stationed by the Hu army. The Japanese army intends to manage the two ports of Xinsheng and Zhanghuang, lure merchants, and from time to time burn the passengers and goods of the Chinese army stationed in the port with steamships, both threatening and intimidating. It burned the port of Zhouwu last month, intending to force the passengers and goods to enter through the two ports of Xinzhang and Rugao in order to increase tax revenue. At dawn on the 14th of this month, hundreds of Japanese people advanced westward from Pingchao in Nantong. First, they occupied the Jiangjie Bridge, and then occupied the ports of Niantuo and Siyu, and stationed themselves in the area of Yingfang Port. They had a lot of steel cannons and military equipment, and they showed off by firing guns and cannons. The residents fled in droves. The guerrilla team, due to the disparity in numbers, held the four suburbs and waited for an opportunity to counterattack. It is said that the Japanese army is digging trenches and building fortifications in Niantuo Port and other places, and has not burned civilian houses, which seems to be a permanent residence. If it expands for a long time and does not leave, then there will be no place in Tongzhou and Rugao to safely enter and exit, and shipping will almost be in the hands of the Japanese army. On the 15th, the British merchant Huang Xiao ship sailed from Shanghai to Zhou, but due to the chaos along the river, it was inconvenient to load and unload, so the passengers and cargo were returned to Shanghai on the original ship.

### Jiangsu Department of Education Stipulates Fee Standards for Middle Schools; Shanghai Area May Increase Appropriately

(Huaiyin correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education recently found that the fees charged by middle schools in Jiangsu Province were inconsistent, so it specifically submitted a proposal to the provincial government meeting to stipulate the standards for private secondary schools in Jiangsu Province to collect fees, in order to follow and abide by them. The standards are recorded as follows:

(1) Tuition Fee: Junior high school: 10 yuan; Senior high school: 20 yuan. The Shanghai area may increase appropriately, but the junior high school tuition fee shall not exceed 25 yuan, and the senior high school tuition fee shall not exceed 30 yuan. (2) Accommodation Fee: 3 yuan. The Shanghai area may increase appropriately, but the total shall not exceed 20 yuan. Textbook Fee: Junior high school: 4 yuan; Senior high school: 6 yuan. (3) Sports Fee: 1 yuan. (4) Library and Medical Fee: 1 yuan to 2 yuan. (5) Medical Fee: 1 yuan to 2 yuan; Miscellaneous Fee: 2 yuan. The Shanghai area may increase appropriately, but the total shall not exceed 5 yuan. Compensation for Damages Reserve Fund: 5 yuan. For the above fees, except for the third and eighth items, which shall be settled and refunded or paid at the end of the semester, the remaining fees shall not be refunded at the end of the semester. If the school's classes are less than one semester, and the school is suspended due to enemy interference, the various fees collected shall be calculated and refunded on a monthly average basis. Furthermore, schools shall not collect any other fees outside of the stipulated fees.

### After Yangzhou Becomes a Guerrilla Zone, Japanese Side Implements Enslavement Education; Establishes Elementary Schools to Teach Japanese; Central Education Continues as Usual

(Yangzhou correspondence) In Yangzhou, which has been occupied for a year, the Japanese are actively implementing enslavement education in order to poison the children, youth, and ignorant masses of the Chinese people. They are deeply committed. Here, the situation of slave education and the education measures implemented under the control of the central government will be explored separately.

When Yangcheng became a guerrilla zone, most of the education community retreated with the army. A few primary school teachers who were unable to escape were trapped in the city. When the local puppet organization appeared, the Japanese army ordered the establishment of a pseudo "Acculturation Department" (now renamed pseudo "Education Bureau") to summon these unemployed teachers who had no way to make a living and to reorganize schools. Starting this spring, five junior elementary schools and five senior elementary schools were opened in cooperation with these people and the Japanese. The funds were borne by the pseudo "Association". The teaching subjects were old Chinese (the content has been completely revised), moral cultivation, and Japanese, etc. The Japanese language subject was taught by Japanese people. In addition, the Boy Scout education was abolished, which was completely a strategy to weaken the young Chinese citizens. At first, the parents of the students were unwilling to have their disciples accept such slave education, but after being repeatedly urged by the pseudo-organization, they had no choice but to submit. Only those children with the hearts of innocence, the older they are, the clearer their minds. Although Japanese teachers always feed them medicine and play with them to eliminate their national concept, they will never succeed. In the summer, several students in a certain elementary school shouted the slogans "Down with Japanese imperialism" and "Support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek" during class. The school principal and teachers, who were quite hostile to the enemy, were shocked and expelled these students and blamed their parents. Most parents of students were deeply afraid of causing trouble for this in the future, and dared not order their children to enter school, so many taught themselves at home, or set up private schools.

As for middle schools, the Japanese army and the puppet government also initially planned to establish two schools. However, since almost all teachers, staff, and young students from various schools have fled outside and there is no way to recruit them, the school buildings of Yangzhong and other schools in the province were devastated when the Japanese troops entered the city, and all school equipment was gone, making it difficult to restore. The matter was dropped, and another Japanese language cram school was established to attract unemployed youth in the city to study Japanese, which in the future could be exploited by the Japanese to cultivate and dream of a certain influence. In addition, there are people in the church who founded a Shengjing Middle School, and the materials are excellent, and the young people are very weak.

The Japanese side also attaches importance to the so-called "social education" and has a touring movie team that has performed in Yangxian, Shaoxian, and other places. The content of the performances is extremely disgusting and intentionally propagandistic, with the aim of poisoning the local people. The pseudo-society also founded a Chinese newspaper, named "Jiangbei Daily", which publishes absurd news and exaggerates things. Those who are ignorant of the facts secretly read the phosphor newspaper in order to get the correct news. This newspaper is brought in by newspaper vendors every day, with a small number of sheets selling for several cents or a dime, and the prices are endlessly disputed. Later, after being found out by the Japanese, the newspaper vendors were severely punished, which was also a tragedy. Finally, the situation in the townships under the jurisdiction of the Jiangdu County Magistrate is described. Primary schools all hold classes as usual, and the teachers receive a low-limit living allowance. The children's string sounds are not reported, and education is greater than before. In the middle school section, the provincial Yangzhong has relocated to Shanghai and Taixian, and the private Yangzhong is in Fanchuan, on the border of Yangtai. In addition, there is a provincial-run high school in Jiangyan Town, Taixian County. Most of the teachers and students are former members of Yangzhou Normal School, so middle school students from various schools in Yangcheng have been placed outside. Few students are asking for a smile, and there are a few who have no ability to laugh. Those who are willing to go outside enter the cram schools set up privately in the townships to study, and still do not lose their opportunity to study.

### Jiangsu Education Director Ma Returns to Taixian From Shanghai

(Taixian correspondence) Ma Yuanfang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, had previously planned to go to Shanghai for official business, but was called back by Chairman Han after passing through Fudong. On the 11th, Director Ma arrived in Taixian from the province. On the 12th, he went to the county high school, Shimin High School, Fan and Yangzhong to inspect them separately, and then decided where to go next.

### Fujian Middle School Suspension and Reinstatement Restriction Measures

The Department of Education Ordered All Middle Schools to Follow

(Yongan correspondence) The Fujian Department of Education has formulated measures to restrict the reinstatement of students who have suspended their studies in middle schools and issued instructions to all middle schools in the province: It is found that students in middle or normal schools may request to suspend their studies for one semester or one school year due to special circumstances of physical or family reasons. The amended middle school regulations and the amended normal school regulations have clearly stipulated this. However, during the war of resistance, various schools have their own arrangements, and there are countless requests for suspension of studies, and the ridge cannot be gnawed, and students who fail to return to school on time should be given some leniency to help them. The following regulations are hereby formulated in accordance with the regulations and with reference to the actual situation: Students who request to suspend their studies shall, in accordance with the regulations, be limited to a maximum of one school year in principle. However, if they are unable to resume their studies after the suspension period due to special circumstances, they may continue to request to suspend their studies for one semester or one school year. Students who request to suspend their studies must undergo a grade placement test when requesting to resume their studies, and may resume their studies after passing the test. Those who have suspended their studies and have not requested to continue their suspension, or who have continued to suspend their studies and have not resumed their studies, shall not be allowed to resume their studies in the future. The suspension and resumption of studies in vocational schools shall be handled in accordance with the above provisions. In addition to separate orders, they shall be transported.

### Ma Xiangbo Founds South China University

Ma Xiangbo, a centenarian, has been living in Guilin since the capital moved west, but he is very concerned about the youth who have graduated from the occupied areas of Southeast China. He has specially invited famous scholars from home and abroad to establish South China University in Shanghai, with colleges of agriculture, engineering, and commerce, specializing in cultivating high-end education talents and helping unemployed youth.

### Ma Gongyu and Others Open Huaying Girls' High School

Shanghai Chinese and Western education celebrities Ma Gongyu and Dr. Wilson, etc., in view of the large number of high-end residents in the western part of the city, and the lack of appropriate girls' schools, initiated the establishment of Huaying Girls' High School and affiliated primary school, located in the southern end of Mail West Road Xiafei Road, with convenient transportation and a quiet environment. The reporter specially visited and saw that the school buildings are spacious, with sufficient light, complete equipment, and the large size of the sports field is the most rare in the current special zone where land is as valuable as gold. The faculty members are all knowledgeable and experienced people, and the management and teaching take a strict approach, with equal emphasis on Chinese and science. English is taught by British people, allowing students to make progress easily. According to the chairman Ma Gong and Principal Zhou Linzhi, it took a lot of effort to prepare this school and it took half a year to complete. It has now been submitted to the central management education authorities for filing. Since the enrollment of this semester, the number of students entering the school has been very enthusiastic.

### School Overview / Zhengguang Middle School

In the summer of 1938, Zhengguang Middle School, which had a strong reputation in this city, announced its closure. The school's educators, Meng Xixun, Fei Bili, Guo Zhishi, Zhu Hongting, Bu Saihuai, Lin Zhenxian, Xu Zongjun, Chen Lixing, and others, in response to the requests of numerous students and their parents, reorganized the school. They used the Hong Kong Yingzhuan Shanghai Branch School on Avenue Edward VII as the school site and named it Hong Kong Middle School. Their purpose was to enhance the good foundation of young people's knowledge and moral character. Meng Xixun was appointed as the principal. Later, due to the small school building and the increasing number of students, the school moved to No. 210, Gordon Road. Recently, they hired Yuan Yudeng, Wei Ziai, He Bingzhao, Dan Shiliang, Wu Ruilan, Ji Lunfang, Kuo Fenyi, Ni Puli, Xiang Gujin, Zhi Biaoqun, and Bu Qingru as teachers. They organized a school board and renamed the school Zhengguang, meaning to promote and glorify the teaching spirit of Zhengguang in the past. They have submitted an application to the Ministry of Education of the National Government for registration, and all procedures have been completed.

The school is organized into junior and senior high school departments, as well as general science classes and senior high school civil engineering classes. Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry are the main subjects. Emphasis is placed on daily tutoring. Engineering classes focus on surveying, drafting, and other subjects. Monthly exams are held three times each semester, and students' academic and moral conduct are reported to parents at any time. Students with excellent academic performance are not only listed on the honor roll but also receive separate awards. Students who rank first in the semester exam in the highest grade will also be exempt from tuition fees for the next semester. Moral education is also implemented through the mentor system, focusing on encouragement. Those who violate school rules will be severely punished. Furthermore, to promote students' extracurricular knowledge, in addition to requiring extracurricular reading of books and newspapers, a lecture topic is prepared every week, and famous figures from various fields are invited to the school to give lectures. As a result, all students in the school are diligent and motivated, with thriving interests. It is rumored that the school will expand its school building, purchase books and equipment, and enrich various facilities in the upcoming semester.

### Dissection

— Bai Jiao

I have always found it strange that the Chinese people boast to the world of being a peace-loving nation and tirelessly declare this to others, even to robbers, again and again. The only meaning of this, apart from saying "Spare me!" or indicating "I am utterly powerless," seems to be without reason.

The actions of all clever people in the world often lead them to admire their own clever methods, momentarily delighted and satisfied; but later, they find themselves at a loss, or even realize that they are foolish. Even if not, even if they are clever throughout their lives, time will tell them that their methods are foolish. Because they have forgotten "human nature."

Speaking of loving peace, who doesn't love peace? But you must not forget that loving war is also "human nature" - it is a fact! Just as promoting kindness and goodness is a virtue, but human nature tends to enjoy revealing secrets and exposing ugliness; striving for progress is what ambitious people do, but indulging in degradation is also the result of the release of innate nature.

Watching a fight is, after all, an interesting thing; dishonorable rumors are always "a hundred dogs barking"; the path to depravity is often one of no return.

Therefore, loving peace is not a characteristic unique to the Chinese nation, just as every nation has a "Jewish class" to some extent, and even every person's blood carries some "Jewish" blood!

However, people are always unwilling to "speak the truth" about facts. The "civilized person's" hypocrisy and the "gentleman's" pretense are the masterpieces of the world. When we read history, we always feel that the times of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Cao Cao, and Wang Mang were too short. There has never been an officially commissioned History of the Qin Dynasty, History of the Wei Dynasty, History of the Xin Mang Dynasty... and so on. Therefore, Mencius' words, "It is better to have no book than to believe everything in a book," and Zeng Guofan's inscription on his tomb, "Do not believe in books, believe in luck, these words are for the world, a true statement," are positive articles. The scarcity and preciousness of positive articles are due to the fact that they are not readily discussed by the general public.

Why do European and American gentlemen sympathize with Jewish millionaires while ignoring the oppressed weak? Why did Mr. Romain Rolland ultimately advocate for peace, risking opposition? Why did democratic countries indifferently "sympathize" and "condemn" some time ago, and only now show an expression of "righteousness" and "anger"? This requires a "direct view"! At least, I think it can prove that there are no accidental events in the universe, because the "inevitability" of a thing is in accordance with the explanation of "human nature."

In the East, there are three types of saintly figures. One pretends not to eat pig's head meat, one does not dare to look directly at pig's cheek meat, and one admits that pig's head meat is for human consumption. However, these are three different expressions of human nature.

"Do not see what is desirable so that the heart is not confused." We do not need to say that this saintly attitude of "not looking directly" is too small and lacks heroic spirit, precisely because saints are not superhuman. It is said that one reason why some people dare not look at women is because looking at them makes their hearts beat faster; to avoid heart palpitations, they cannot help but put on a serious face, lower their heads, turn their necks, and tighten their steps. Mr. Shi Zhefu of Jiangyin said, "Those whose eyes do not look sideways, their intentions can be known!" This is truly a very pertinent saying. But my intention is not to judge the heart, but to encourage everyone to dare to speak the truth about facts.

Everyone admits that young people are progressive. They are passionate and dare to face life directly. But those who are content with old habits and laziness, or those who are old and unwilling to be revolutionary reformers, suddenly lower their heads, turn their heads, and tighten their steps to walk backward. Examples of this kind are not considered a rare thing.

Young people in their student days often consider themselves reformers and the backbone of the new society; but not many years later, they become typical new-style gentlemen. Traditional prejudiced reasons have long driven away their reformist ideas. Similarly, a lady with progressive ideas first regards herself as a new woman, but at the time of marriage, she immediately becomes a most vulgar modern young mistress, using her status as a decoration and appendage of a wealthy husband to take pride in, mocking her former companions. The slogan of the new women's era is perfect for finding a desirable husband. This is as natural as spitting for the Chinese. Therefore, experienced predecessors cannot help but smile at parents who think their offspring's ideas are too left-leaning, thinking they are simply overthinking!

The traitors in history were not just any nameless person at the time; they were definitely not paupers; they were definitely not people who did not understand the meaning of the words "Han" and "traitor"—even to the point of praising the greatness of the Han Dynasty, writing poems and paintings, and praising integrity, just like Zheng Xiaoxu, Zhu Keming, and Liang Hongzhi of modern times, and Huang Jun, who wrote "Flowers Follow the Holy Coffin: Gleanings" and played the "Old Traitor," were definitely not ordinary characters like Xiao Sanzi, Xiao Liuzi, Wang Wu, and Zhao Liu!

Who is more shameless? Who has achieved greater results as a traitor? Is it the wealthy or the pauper? Is it the prestigious and powerful or the nameless person? Is it the intellectual or the ignorant?

"Demons arise from people." A great era is truly a demon-revealing mirror. Why do people still not dare to face it directly?

### Living in the Countryside

— Ying Jun

Several young companions, abandoning their books, shouldered the banner of anti-Japanese education and ran to the suburbs of W City, where they lived for more than a month. The possible outcome is: either we will be aged by the old environment, or we will transform the dullness and make it youthful, so that we can stand up in this great era. We have confidence and are not lacking in enthusiasm. Perhaps we are all a little too naive, but this is not enough to be called an insurmountable obstacle in our work; we are about to be tempered by our work.

At first, the farmers widened their eyes and watched us enter their villages, living a life no different from theirs, carrying water every day, cooking meals, buying vegetables, and basking in the sun. We cast the anchor of our lives here, and life has fastened us here, and we will sow already salty seeds here, although work requires us to pick up this anchor from time to time and sail further away, letting others harvest here.

The farmers soon carried tables and stools, dragged their children, and mumbled the same set of words, saying how naughty the children were, and that it was hard work for the teachers to teach them. Obviously, this was an action they had consulted together. Our gentle attitude slightly dispelled their excessive respect for us. When they saw the children obediently listening to the teacher, forming circles, singing songs, and opening books to learn to count, their faces showed

### Inspire Your Courage to Move Forward

— Li Wen

Why weep? Wipe away your tears. Inspire your courage and move forward! Can't you hear the motherland calling out loudly? Don't you know the motherland needs us, the youth? Don't be discouraged or fearful, inspire your courage and move forward! Respect ourselves, and deeply remember the shame. Fight to the very end for the rebirth of our motherland! Don't be decadent or dispirited, rouse your spirit! In the face of darkness, save our country, our home. Don't retreat, there's nothing to hold you back! Light is just ahead, only needing you to inspire your courage and move forward! A kind smile.

It is the slack season for farming; during the day, we only pound some grain and grind some flour to prepare for the New Year. However, these activities do not hinder us from drawing water and can still be considered a time for chatting. The distance between us and the farmers has been greatly reduced. Although after exchanging greetings, the young wives are still busy shyly offering stools and serving tea, and when we tread on the rice mortar and turn the windmill, the old grandmothers still force a smile and mutter, "Sin, sin," we can now talk freely. The trivial matters in the village and the harvest of the fields have all become topics of conversation. Besides these, in the conversations, we have given them a preliminary understanding of conscription, requisitions, and taxes; these orders are not just making them suffer. Gradually, they have developed a sense of the nation and the people, and they have begun to care about the progress of the war. During their spare time, the young wives and girls drag their female companions into their deep boudoirs to pour out their hearts and seek answers to many questions. They are surprised that we men and women live together, but they quickly understand that this era is very different from their grandmothers' era. They had been abandoned in the depths of hundreds of years, but now, in their hearts, the consciousness of anti-feudalism is growing. They have a friendship with their female companions that goes beyond sisterhood.

Every morning, a group of people and livestock habitually stand beside the white wall of the ancestral hall. Those who can read noisily read aloud, while those who are illiterate open their mouths wide to listen and look at the cartoons, and the livestock continue to graze at their feet. They always earnestly shout, "Teacher, stay a little longer and tell us more." Yes, the simplified wall posters are not enough; they need to know more. They have many questions and many opinions, and they often extend the debate to our small house to resolve their doubts. The people of the whole village are learning, with different degrees of progress: some have a concept of international relations, while others still ask why the cities on the map are so small, while the enemy's planes are so big. But they all recognize the enemy and are unwilling to succumb to a life of slavery.

The Lianbao Chief has appointed us as political instructors for militia training. Every morning, two of us have to climb over the mountain to give speeches and teach songs, and by the way, bring back the day's newspapers. This long stretch of road is rugged and muddy, but it relies on our efforts to shorten the distance between the Lianbao Chief and the villagers. This is our opportunity to adjust these relationships well. Later, the villagers even performed a three-day flower drum opera with the stationed military.

Every dusk, under the flickering oil lamp, a group of people gather, and the burning charcoal brazier heats their faces. Our small house is packed to saturation. Occasionally, wind and rain interrupt this customary evening gathering, and our house seems terribly large. The farmers are not aware that this is a collective discussion; they are just asking questions and looking for answers. But they can often find the central point of the questions raised on the wall posters, although sometimes they are innocently ridiculous, but how can they not contain an element of truth? Once, against a fatalist's argument for the weapon-only theory, they automatically concentrated their firepower to attack, and as a result, the speaker cried and asked us for help. In the face of pure truth, how despicable and shameful are those who intentionally or unintentionally put on a false facade!

However, on the third day of the New Year, after performing three days of opera, we announced that we were leaving C Village for more important work, even though the coarse rice and beans in the small house were not yet finished.

A group of people stood at the entrance of the village; futilely trying to persuade us to stay only added to the mood of disappointment. The children leaned against their parents silently, and the young wives secretly shed two lines of tears. "Come back often, teachers…" In this voice, the old donkey dragged our luggage and staggered out of the village.

The two rows of towering old trees at the entrance of C Village disappeared into the horizon, and we seemed to still hear, "You must come back, teachers…"

### Water Margin and National Revolution

— Zou Xiao

——Talking about National Novels

Water Margin has a very close relationship with the national revolution. To elaborate, there are the following five points:

First, is the late Ming Guan Shengyu's praise of the images of Liangshan characters. For example, when Li Song painted a portrait, Guan Shengyu would write a eulogy for the portrait. Guan Shengyu was a figure in the Ming Dynasty Cheng Minzheng's (Records of Ming Loyalists) records; his praise of the heroes of Water Margin shows how eagerly he hoped that grassroots heroes would rise up to restore the Song Dynasty and drive the Yuan people out of the Han territory.

Second, is that many of the Water Margin stories in the Yuan Dynasty Luo Guanzhong conform to historical facts. For example, Dong Ping was a bandit in Hunan. For example, Guan Sheng once resisted the Jin soldiers, as seen in the Zhu Shi and Jin Shi's Biography of Liu Yu. There was also Da Dao Wei Sheng who led the loyal army of Shandong in the thirty-first year of Shaoxing to fight against the Jin people, as seen in Song Shi Volume 368. As for Zhang Shun and Zhang Gui, they can be compared to Langli Baitiao Zhang Shun and Chuanhuo'er Zhang Heng. In one episode, Zhang Shun returned to the secret of Yongjin Gate. In Song Dynasty history, Zhang Shun did indeed die in the river, but it was the Yangtze River, not the Qiantang River, and the one he was attacking was the Yuan Dynasty's surrendered general Lu Wenhuan. For example, Wang Youzhi of Hebei is a shadow of Liangshan's Wang Si and Lin Lujunyi; both of them lived in Daming Prefecture; moreover, the loyal army led by Wang Youzhi was a very large force, counting tens of thousands of soldiers. Youzhi was also a commander on the imperial court's side, different from ordinary bandits, so Water Margin placed him in the second position to show respect. (The above arguments are quoted from Xie Xingyao's Research on Water Margin Characters in the first issue of Yi Jing) The situation is quite similar to the rise of guerrillas in various places now. Luo Guanzhong personally suffered under the rule of the Yuan Dynasty, and he probably had some feelings of hunger, right?

Third is the addition of the conquest of Liaoning in the version of Guo Xun's mansion during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. This is quite meaningful. At that time, the northern border had Anda repeatedly invading, and the southern border had Japanese pirates often harassing. The people in Guo Xun's mansion wanted to have heroes like those in Water Margin to defend the states, so they added the conquest of Liaoning to think of the ancients.

Fourth is Zhang Dai (Tao'an Mengyi) of the late Ming Dynasty wanting to save the decline of the Ming Dynasty. He praised the characters on Liangshan, saying that "the spirit of heroism, loyalty, and righteousness is accumulated in the brush and ink," which shows how much he yearned for those patriotic warriors and hoped that the late Ming Dynasty would also have such heroes to resist the Manchus.

Fifth is the use of Water Margin by the Heaven and Earth Society in the late Qing Dynasty. The Heaven and Earth Society means taking heaven as father and earth as mother, which comes from Water Margin's "pointing to heaven and earth as parents." The Xiamen team is one family, which coincides with Pearl Buck's later translation of Water Margin as "All Men Are Brothers." Therefore, there are two articles in the current Kangxi law prohibiting brotherhood. Later, the Heaven and Earth Society (i.e., the Triads or Red Turban) joined Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui, contributing a lot to the overthrow of the Manchus.

The above five points are the relationship between Water Margin and the national revolution. We should also read Water Margin now, and people from all over should rise up to fight in self-defense and guerrilla warfare.

Commercial News

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Suffered a Surprising Plunge Yesterday, a Wild Drop of More Than Six Yuan, Ultimately Settling Around Five Yuan Less. Rumors Circulated at Closing That Payments in Shanghai Could Be Made Via Remittance Drafts, Which Accords With This Newspaper's Claim on the 15th. External Debt Secured by Customs Duties Totals Approximately 30 Million Pounds, With Four Types Due for Interest Payment This Month, Including the Rehabilitation Loan.

The securities grey market experienced an unexpected and bizarre shift yesterday after August 13th. Market prices plummeted, falling sharply. At the peak of the turmoil, prices were about five yuan lower than the previous weekend. Under normal circumstances, this would have resulted in an immediate halt to trading. But now, these are cash transactions, without limits on price fluctuations. After competition between buyers and sellers, prices rebounded slightly, rising about one yuan at noon. The cause of this intense and drastic change stems from a cable from Chongqing stating that the Ministry of Finance would no longer advance funds for various debt obligations secured by customs duties, due to the Japanese seizure of those funds. Last week, there were rumors of two possibilities: paying this period's interest in Chongqing or disbursing it in monthly installments. Just as people were feeling bewildered and anxious, this new measure, tantamount to suspension, understandably caused further panic in the market. It is speculated that the government's intention is for countries concerned about debts secured by customs revenue to deeply understand the dangers to their claims because of the Japanese seizure of both domestic and foreign debt funds, and to promptly realize the danger, cease indifference, and take effective and proper measures of restraint. From the government's perspective, this would more effectively maintain the legal tender. These are fine intentions and righteous measures, beyond reproach. Since domestic bonds are secured by customs revenue, and since foreign debt has been delayed for this reason, how could domestic debt be an exception? The fragile market sentiment has been dealt a heavy blow, and it is self-evident that sellers are competing to sell off as quickly as possible. However, the truth remains to be confirmed by an official cable from the government. At the closing bell, at 4:00 PM and 4:15 PM, news suddenly emerged from the Central Bank that payment of these interest coupons would be permitted via remittance drafts. This would avoid conflict with international debt obligations payable in legal tender, maintain creditworthiness as before, and cause no loss to bondholders. The government's concern for the interests of the people is demonstrated further. This also accords with what this newspaper argued previously (see the 15th), that it would be better to continue paying interest in Shanghai, but by remittance draft. This news reached the market late. Those who were first to sense the changing wind direction began to search for ways to buy back bonds, but were unable to obtain them. It is predicted that after the market opens today, there will be a significant and dramatic rebound. The lines of battle between buyers and sellers yesterday are quite thought-provoking. All the sellers were small investors, seeking only to unload their bonds regardless of price. All the buyers were large firms. In the morning, firms such as Xinfeng, Yongtong, Kang, and Tiansheng, with code numbers around "6," all took advantage of the situation to drive down prices and buy cheaply. Therefore, the rise and fall of the market often differed by one to two yuan. The lowest price was more than six yuan lower than the previous weekend. The severity of the turmoil was rare. But in the end, it was much ado about nothing. In the afternoon, small investors sold off in large quantities again, and the gains from the morning were immediately wiped out, even more so than before. Later, Xinfeng, Yong, and Tongkang, with code number "35," continued to absorb as much supply as possible, and the market price rose again by a few jiao. In the end, market prices closed down by 3.4 to 4.9 yuan. It is predicted that after the market rebounds today, it should stabilize. The result of the day's turmoil was entirely due to the foreign debt issue. All parties should remain calm and not act rashly. The total volume traded was approximately 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Among stocks, only shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at the stock exchange, with approximately 170 shares changing hands at a price of 5.725 yuan. As of January 1, 1939, the outstanding principal of foreign debt secured by customs duties and the Boxer Indemnity was 24,396,530 pounds and 25,536,500 US dollars. If converted to pounds, this would be more than 30 million pounds. This includes the Anglo-German Continuation Loan of 3,666,650 pounds, the Rehabilitation Loan of 19,691,880 pounds, the Sino-French US Dollar Bonds of 24,919,500 yuan, the Sino-Belgian US Dollar Bonds of 617,000 yuan, and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Bonds of 1,038,000 pounds. Except for the Anglo-German Continuation Loan, interest on the other four types of bonds is due on the 1st and 15th of this month. For foreign debt secured by salt taxes and other collateral, please refer to this newspaper's continuing series, starting today.

Yesterday's special economic column of this newspaper, which described the Anglo-Japanese handling of the Shanghai Customs, also noted the difficulty in continuing to pay foreign debt, which is the inevitable result of Britain's policy of appeasement. The weaker the British, the more assertive the Japanese. If, because of the Japanese assertiveness, even foreign admirers of realism reach the point of compromising and making concessions to not pay the principal and interest on the foreign debt in order to obtain small immediate benefits, and thus destroy the only remaining interests in the Far East, then there will inevitably come a day when it will be too late to regret. Only by using real strength to assist China and recover lost territory can foreign debt principal and interest be paid on schedule, and all foreign interests can continue to be enjoyed as usual.

In the past two years, many wealthy Chinese have sought to escape capital flight by buying back foreign debt. In particular, banks have also used foreign debt as a form of reserve asset. Once principal and interest payments are delayed, difficulties will inevitably be felt. But this is a means of destruction by the Japanese puppets. In any case, all parties should work together to overcome this difficulty, so that the Japanese destructive plans are not realized. Fortunately, no one is yielding to their coercion because of temporary pain, so that the Japanese can achieve their aims. If the result is that today's gains are small and the actual losses are great. Generally, Chinese bondholders have three different attitudes. One is frustration and great disappointment. One is that after foreign negotiation, the Japanese puppets would never brazenly disregard their obligations. One is that no matter what, final victory will ultimately belong to us, and that the non-payment is only temporary, and that in the future, both principal and interest will be fully recovered. Therefore, China can only strengthen its war of resistance efforts to achieve an early victory. Only in this way will the payment of principal and interest have a chance of success soon. If we bow our heads and beg for mercy, the result will ultimately be nothing. Only those with determination can regain their lost rights. Therefore, non-payment of foreign debt will of course have an impact on Chinese finance, but its effect is still slight. As for the loss of external credibility, the blame does not lie with us. The Chinese authorities must have a way to resolve it. London foreign debt market closed on Saturday, so there was no cable. Supply was tight, and prices were weak, with the possibility of continued decline. The kerchief market was affected by foreign exchange tightness and debt market panic, and absorbed supply. With so little available for sale, how could so much be absorbed? As a result, supply could not keep up, and market prices soared, breaking recent records, and the trend was strong. Foreign currency followed the weakness of foreign exchange and rose sharply due to the kerchief market surge. Over-the-counter trading was very active, and the trend was promising. Inter-guild trading was still strong. Yikang sold Changtai, buying 5,000 French franc notes. Xiangkang sold Changtai, buying 100 Singapore dollar notes. Changtai sold Sentai, buying 100 Singapore dollar notes. Qintai sold Sentai, buying 130 Singapore dollar notes. Chengtai sold Hongchang, buying 1,000 US dollar notes. Hongchang sold Xiangtai, buying 500 US dollar notes, and sold Xintai, buying 500 US dollar notes. Yesterday's market prices: the British gold pound rose 4 jiao, the British gold note rose 2.5 jiao, the US gold pound rose 4 jiao, the US gold note rose 3.5 li, the Hong Kong note rose 7 li, the French franc note rose 2 li, and the Singapore and Dutch notes each rose 5 fen. Canadian notes rose 1 fen, and Philippine notes rose 4 fen. Other minor currencies did not change because no trading took place.

### Finance: Customs Duty Interest Not Sufficient for Overdrafts, Drastic Changes in Gold, Selling Off Government Bonds to Buy Cash, Peak at 2,018 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash kerchief grey market situation, although British pure gold fell again, the local gold price moved towards a peak. Reports that the Ministry of Finance announced that payment of all bonds guaranteed by customs revenue would be temporarily suspended triggered a general desire among the wealthy to buy and hoard gold, and they sold off government bonds and switched to gold. In addition, foreign exchange was slightly weaker after being fiercely bought by various foreign firms, so buying interest was high. Although some gold shops and silver shops dumped, the supply was still insufficient, so the price broke through the 2,010 yuan mark, reaching a peak of 2,018 yuan. However, the money exchange industry and silver shops sold at high prices, causing the price to fall slightly at one point. Finally, it was difficult to maintain for long due to the lack of supply, and the price surged again by 17 yuan. The hearts of various groups were firm, but slightly unstable. Trading was quite active throughout the day. Silver shop jewelry gold also rose twice. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold fell again.

The kerchief Market Soared 17 Yuan Yesterday

Since morning, the initial prices (per bar of ten taels) caused general concern due to reports that the Ministry of Finance announced that payment of all bonds guaranteed by customs revenue would be temporarily suspended, so the general desire among wealthy individuals to buy gold was strong again, causing the price to open high. First, a money exchange industry entered 50 taels of gold at a gold shop, with an opening price of 2,003 yuan. Then, the securities group also entered 100 taels at a cash shop at a price of 04 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry came to buy gold again, entering 50 taels at a gold shop at a price of 07 yuan, and entering 50 taels at a silver shop at a price of 06 yuan. The price rose gradually as foreign exchange slightly weakened. Another money exchange industry entered 50 taels at a silver shop at a price of 07 yuan. A certain money exchange industry also came to buy, entering 100 taels at a fellow company at prices of 08 yuan and 09 yuan. After a certain silver shop absorbed supply, it immediately resold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry at a price of 12 yuan. Later, it suddenly entered 50 taels at a money exchange industry at a price of 10 yuan. At the opportunity, another silver shop group entered 50 taels at a money exchange industry at prices of 08 yuan and 06 yuan. Finally, the money exchange industry entered 50 taels at a gold shop, with a closing price of 08 yuan at noon. Although foreign exchange was stable in the afternoon, the money exchange industry's intention to buy was even more urgent, and sellers were extremely scarce, so the upward trend was quite sharp. The opening price was raised to 2,011 yuan. Then, the money exchange industry made 50 taels amongst themselves. Later, the money exchange industry entered 90 taels at a silver shop group at a price of 14 yuan. Later, the money exchange industry entered 50 taels at a silver shop group at a price of 18 yuan, which was the highest price. At 3:40, the money exchange industry entered 50 taels at a gold shop, with a closing price of 2,017 yuan in the evening, an increase of 17 yuan compared to last Saturday. Thereafter, the appetite of buyers turned light, while sellers were active and gradually shouted down to 12 and 13 yuan, but no one entered (it was rumored that the money exchange industry was trading over the counter at 12 yuan for dozens of taels). In the end, a certain money exchange industry wanted to buy again, but those who entered were looking around, so they raised the price to 14 and 15 yuan, but no trading took place. The cash shop's own gold sold at a price of 2,025 yuan and bought back at 2,010 yuan. The current target gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.

Jewelry Gold Suspended at 205 Yuan

The initial price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael was not changed. At 10:24 AM, when the kerchief market broke through the 2,010 yuan mark, it also rose by one yuan. Later, at 3:25 PM, the kerchief market rose to the border of 2,020 yuan, so it was raised another yuan. Da Tongxing changed the suspended price to 205 yuan, and Xin Tongxing suspended at 203 yuan, buying back at 197 yuan.

Central Pure Gold Down 1.1 Yuan

The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold (kerchief) fell to 1,214.6 yuan. The listed customs gold also fell by 2 li, calculated at 2.401 yuan. The Shanghai standard target gold price also fell by 1.1 yuan, calculated at 1,209.9 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Soars

Since last Saturday, British pure gold has fallen by half a point, and the British-American exchange rate has risen by 6,875. Because the Japanese detained customs duties and deposited them in Japanese banks, refusing to release them, in order to undermine China's currency policy and creditworthiness, the central government has adopted a strict stance and will no longer tolerate it. It has refused the Customs Service to continue overdrafts from the Central Bank to pay debt interest, causing public agitation and driving purchases of foreign exchange. Foreign firms are closing their accounts.

### No Impact on the Foreign Exchange Fund, Although Foreign Firms Are Still Closing Their Accounts, the Resulting Tightness Is Very Slight

Yesterday, although the foreign exchange market received news of the Chinese Ministry of Finance's announcement that customs duties in war zones had been seized, and that various debts guaranteed by customs revenue would be divided according to the revenue from each customs house and would no longer be overdrafted, this adjustment to financial steps had no impact on the foreign exchange fund. Not allowing overdrafts can save a large outflow of foreign exchange. Moreover, the previous overdraft amount was not very large. As for the principal and interest of domestic debt, they will still be paid as usual, so there is no impact on foreign exchange matters. Therefore, although foreign firms were closing their accounts busily yesterday and the supply from banks was not smooth, the resulting tightness was very slight. In the middle of the day, there was foreign cable traffic from Hong Kong, so the situation tended to be stable, without excessive fluctuations. Trading was quite active.

In the early morning, London's near and far cables were long, but New York spot prices did not change. London's raw gold shrank by half a point, and the exchange rate between Britain and the United States rose by 3 li and 7 sheng, and between Britain and France by 13 centimes. There was no change with Shanghai. The US dollar rose against the British dollar by 6,875, and against the French dollar by 625. There was no change with Shanghai. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained stable as before. The silver balance tax was announced to be 1.5 fen higher. Thereafter, because foreign firms were closing their accounts frequently, and because banks were not providing a smooth supply, and also because there were rumors that government bonds had plummeted, the situation gradually became firmer and softer. US dollars only closed at 16.25 yuan, British dollars at 8.34375 jiao, and Hong Kong dollars only closed at 55.875 yuan. Banks absorbed supply above 56 yuan, and then returned slightly to 56.125 yuan. There was no change after that. Close to noon, only trading in Hong Kong dollars opened. Although money exchange industries were selling, foreign firms were buying, and banks were also making profitable trades, so the process was still smooth. The noon closing price for British dollars was 8.34375 jiao, and for US dollars it was 16.25 yuan.

In the later market, although foreign firms were still closing accounts busily, banks were still selling, resulting in a lack of change. Finally, the intention of foreign cable traffic to supply emerged again, and speculators also followed the trend and sold off. Also, the banks' appetite for absorption was not good, so the situation seemed to be slightly looser. By the late closing, the banks' selling price for British dollars was 8.34375 jiao and for US dollars it was 16.25 yuan. As a result, British dollars shrank by 0.03125 yuan, and US dollars tightened by 0.0625 yuan compared to last Saturday, and Hong Kong dollars tightened by 0.25 yuan. The trading market that opened yesterday was omitted due to space constraints.

### Hoarding Cash

Since the government bond interest payment issue occurred, the discount rate has rebounded, as expected. Yesterday, the discount rate for remittance drafts and cash drafts changed greatly. The need for cash is increasing every day. Those who have it are hoarding it. Initially, every 1,000 yuan was still hovering around 35 yuan, but soon it rose to 37.25 yuan, 36.75 yuan at noon, and continued to fall slightly in the afternoon. Finally, it was 36.25 yuan, which was 1.5 yuan higher than last Saturday.

### Dried Goods: Black Fungus After Soaring Prices, All Shops Are Considering Selling

Black fungus soared in price last week because the warehouses had run out and were eager to buy. But once the market price was high, all the shops holding stock considered selling, so the market situation suddenly turned soft. According to yesterday's market conditions, the opening price in the future should be at least 7 or 8 yuan lower, because the vendors were unable to raise their sales prices too much.

### Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Factory's Raw Materials Shift to Imported Cotton: The Golden Age of Local Cotton is Over

Imported cotton market prices: New York turned positive due to the rebound in securities, and cloth sales remained good. However, due to the debate in Washington regarding agricultural legislation, no resolution has been heard, leading to public unease. There is a shortage of spot goods in the market, and the market is exceptionally tight. According to statistical reports, U.S. domestic cotton consumption in December was 565,307 bales, an increase of 132,979 bales compared to 432,328 bales in the same period last year. Yesterday, spot traders and exporters were the main buyers in the market, resulting in a rise of 10 points per pound for near-term contracts and 8-9 points per pound for deferred contracts. Indian cotton, including speculative trading, rose by more than one rupee, while Egyptian cotton fell by 2-3 points per pound. Yesterday's exchange rate slightly decreased, but when converted to legal tender, cotton prices all rose. American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 1.15 yuan per picul, Indian cotton rose by 0.7 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 1.4 yuan.

In the local imported cotton trade, China Textile Industries and Shen Hsin again ordered 3,000 bales of Indian cotton from Shengheng Foreign Firm, including 1,000 bales of American upland cotton at a factory price of 88 yuan, and 2,000 bales of extra-grade Omra cotton at a delivered factory price of 72.5 yuan. Hongzhang also purchased 300 bales of Indian cotton en route. Japanese factories remain the main consumers of imported cotton, as local cotton inventory is very low and nearing depletion. If arrangements are not made promptly, there may be a shortage in the future. The transaction volume of yesterday is listed below:

Yesterday's Transaction Volume

Shen Hsin imported 3,000 bales of Indian cotton

Hongzhang imported 300 bales of Indian cotton

Yufeng imported 500 bales of Indian cotton

Yufeng imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton

Gongda imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton

Tongxing imported 500 bales of Indian cotton

Tongxing imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton

The local cotton business has turned quiet. Factories, due to the slump in the yarn market and sales not as smooth as before, are unwilling to purchase high-priced raw cotton, leading to stagnant trading and weak market prices. Japanese factories have received a large influx of Indian cotton orders, sufficient for their needs, and currently have no need to purchase local cotton. Therefore, the market is scattered, with only slight activity among peers to fulfill factory quotas, and very little new development. The cotton market is in a state of suspended animation. The source from northern Jiangsu is considerable, with 3,581 bales of ginned cotton arriving in the past two days, 900 pieces arriving from Niantuo Port, and 370 pieces arriving from Beisha. Fifty pieces were exported to Shantou today. The current cotton situation and market conditions are listed on the left:

### Cotton Yarn Shaken by Debt Interest: Floating Sellers Pour Out Like Water, Prices Fall by 5-6 Yuan Each

The yarn market continues to decline, with the downward trend particularly severe. Market rumors suggest that the payment of public debt interest will be moved to Chongqing, leading the public to believe that capital will tighten, with various unfavorable narratives. Floating sellers are cutting their losses, coming one after another, causing the market to plummet. Buyers, sensing that the environment has been good for a long time, are also hesitant to advance, making the trend even more sluggish. When the spot yarn market opened yesterday morning, 20-count Double Horse was at a small 5-cent premium, with the Jiangxi group trading 10 bales. Before long, a selling spree began, claiming that Quanzhou port was automatically closed, Shanghai-Quanzhou flights were suspended, and the air war in Chongqing was fierce, causing public anxiety. Prices were shouted out like water pouring downhill. Double Horse plunged straight to 379 yuan. However, the trading volume among peers was still large, with 445 bales traded. By closing, it was reported that the Yunnan group still had over 200 bales of actual sales. When prices were low, some people came to buy in, and Double Horse rebounded by 2.5 yuan, closing at 381.5 yuan. It was found that 909 bales were traded in the morning, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 5.5 yuan compared to the previous day, Double Globe fell by 4.5 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell by 7 yuan, Special Jincheng fell by 4 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn fell by 5-6 yuan. Factories have not taken any action. 650 pieces were exported to Shantou, 65 pieces to Hong Kong, 35 pieces to Haikou, 75 pieces to Beihai, and 490 pieces to Haiphong. The purchase volume of each group is listed on the left:

Peers 615, Jiangxi 24, Shantou 20, Inland 30, Yunnan 200, Wenzhou 15, Ningbo 5, Total 909

The demand for Japanese yarn is sluggish, public sentiment is scattered, and selling prices have fallen by another 2 yuan. Coupled with the decline in Chinese yarn, Japanese yarn has no spirit to recover. The current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix spot yarn is 302.5 yuan, with 302.5 to 304.5 yuan for this month's delivery. 20-count Water Moon yarn is 309 yuan, with 305.5 to 307 yuan for this month's delivery, it is said.

### Food: Flour and Wheat Firm

Flour

The flour market trend was firm yesterday, with local merchant transactions still not weak. However, Tianjin merchant transactions are still difficult to develop, mainly due to the low Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate and the dumping of foreign flour in the local area. Sales to the north rely only on small-scale operations in Qinhuangdao, Yantai, and Weihai. Southern merchants still inquire from places like Fuzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen. Reports of the closure of Quanzhou port are yet to be confirmed. The total number of transactions yesterday was still around 30,000 bags. Goods of all brands are still following the original price of 4.9 yuan. Yesterday, 22,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin, and 7,250 bags of flour and 1,000 bags of bran were shipped to Shantou.

Wheat

In the past two days, the source of wheat totaled more than 10,000 bags. Some of the newly arrived wheat from Wuhu, northern Jiangsu, etc. was damp, and because it was soft and could not be stored for long, the sellers were quite accommodating. The dry wheat, however, remained as expensive as ever. Because the factories had not received their previously ordered foreign wheat, the need for domestic wheat was justifiable, resulting in 15,000 bags being traded at the original price, with Fuhsin purchasing 10,000 bags and Fu Feng purchasing 5,000 bags. The highest price was still 6.7 yuan. The selling prices of medium-quality goods and damp wheat varied slightly. It is said that a ship of foreign wheat jointly ordered by Fuhsin and Fufeng will arrive at the beginning of next week. Yesterday, 1,400 bags of wheat arrived from Xingang.

### The Future of People's Food is Highly Worrying: Japanese Massively Scouring for Rice; Preparing to Handle Another 200,000 Bags in Changshu, Wuxi, and Other Places; Total Amount of Indica and Japonica Rice Handled Before and After Reaches 700,000 Bags, Causing Panic Among Stockpilers; Many Original Bags Loaded onto Warehouses

Japonica Rice

The source is still limited, with only five boats of Hexia goods arriving, totaling more than 4,000 bags of Chelin Baozi. It is said that after Japanese merchants massively scoured for more than 100,000 bags in Changshu, Wuxi, Hupu, Baimao, and other places earlier, they will scour for another 200,000 bags before the end of this lunar year. They are also scouring for more than 100,000 bags of thin rice from Songjiang, Sijing, and other places. In total, the Japanese merchants have recently handled 700,000 bags of various indica and japonica rice, including those shipped from Wuhu and exported. People are uneasy, thinking that if this is true, the source of rice in Shanghai will be greatly affected. As a result, many large stockpilers are loading their original bags onto warehouses. At the same time, local merchants are also following suit. Sellers are taking advantage of the opportunity to raise prices, and the evening market became lively. As a result, the price of thick glutinous rice continued to rise by a few cents to 1 dime. The route for thin rice was slightly inferior, only improving by 3-5 cents. Yangjian goods were scarce, increasing by another 1 dime. Dudu glutinous rice was slightly higher by a few cents. Because Yin Yuan lacked a large source and the seasonal demand was increasingly frequent, small stockpilers were searching for goods everywhere, causing the price to rise sharply by 2 dimes. Yin Yuan is still out of stock and without a market.

Indica Rice

Although the arrival of rice tails continued, the shortage and sharp rise of Bengjian rice in Hexia has attracted the attention of various local merchants. There are fewer rice tails of Nanjing Gao indica, and the owners are quite speculative. There is a lot of Wuhu rice in stock. It was rumored that a small amount of Jiangxi rice had been shipped in, but all of it was sold as Chongjing and Wuhu indica. Therefore, there has been no official transaction of Jiangxi rice in the market so far. Transactions were brisk yesterday, with around 2,000 bags traded. Most of the sellers were offering high-quality Wuhu indica at 10.05-0.06 yuan, while special Chongbu indica was priced at 11 yuan, an increase of 1-1.5 dimes compared to the end of last week.

### Import and Export: Fortune Oranges Flowing In

Xiamen honey oranges are flowing in steadily, with another 1,770 barrels arriving yesterday, as well as 2,500 pieces of kiln goods.

### Sugar Market: Brown Sugar High, Scant Inventory to Blame

Domestic brown sugar is currently in high demand and selling briskly. As the release of goods has been targeted to the smaller stock counts of Chaozhou brown sugar, asking prices are inevitably raised, with the market showing signs of excessive price inflation. A proper market price will be evident only when new Chaozhou brown sugar arrives in full force. The foreign sugar association’s prices had minor ups and downs. Dutch No. 24 coarse white was priced at 24.65 yuan for stock on the wharf, and 24.5 yuan for off-wharf stock. Transshipment goods were priced at 16.4 yuan. Dutch red sugar and Taikoo car sugar both remained unchanged.

Yesterday, 100 bags of sugar arrived from Beihai, 200 bags from Hong Kong, 590 bags from Shantou, and another 100 bags from Xiamen.

### Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Rising Daily; White Filature Silk Asking Price Reaches 1,350 Yuan

Since the price increase reported in Yokohama last week, overseas silk prices have been rising daily. Local market conditions, coupled with soaring raw material costs and other factors, have made prices more firm and high. Yesterday, Yokohama spot prices rose 5 yuan, opening at 865 yuan; forward prices rose 6 yuan, opening at 856 yuan. The silk market sentiment is hoping to break the 900 yuan mark. Therefore, the asking price for 7-8 grade white filature silk in the local market has jumped to 1,350 yuan. However, this is still more than 30 yuan away from the purchasing price of foreign firms, so no transactions have been heard of. Silk sales in Lyon have been rising rapidly recently. The asking price for non-uniform white filature silk RR, 20-22 denier, opened at 1,300 yuan yesterday, a huge increase of 50 yuan compared to two weeks ago. Yesterday, Xinfu and other firms imported a total of 40 bales. Transactions in Indian non-filature silk were quite quiet yesterday, with no activity all day. White tussah silk prices are very weak. Conversely, the demand for inland silk fabrics has been quite strong. Therefore, more than 10 bales were shipped to Wenzhou yesterday for transshipment to the inland.

The previous day (the 15th), 166 boxes of rayon were imported, coming from Italy.

### Piece Goods: Re-packaged Eastern Cloth Operating Secretly; Transactions in Domestic Cloth Lacking Wholesale

Domestic Cloth

The asking prices for coarse cloth and twill remain unchanged this week. Factory prices for fine cloth and fine twill are very high. However, the sales prices of goods held by peers continue to decline, as transactions with customers are slightly less frequent. The fine cloth of the Dapeng, Fugui, Sipinglian, Renzhong, and Feihong brands all fell by about 1 dime, and twill also fell by 5-10 cents. The reason for this is that after Zhejiang and Jiangxi made huge purchases of Japanese goods last week, they lacked wholesale appetites. In addition, after the market prices were raised excessively, it facilitated the sale of colored cloth and the re-packaged Eastern cloth secretly resumed large-scale operations. Therefore, the transactions in white goods by customers are bleak and lifeless, with only Shantou bringing about 50 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Transactions in other places are sporadic. The customer sales of coarse cloth from Yihua and other factories are sluggish, but factory prices are very firm. The new transactions in colored cloth are more active in Funing, northern Jiangsu, with about 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, kersey, and serge being traded. About 1,500 pieces are also being handled in Wuxi and Changzhou. The retail purchases of Raozhou, Jinhua, Nanchang and other ports along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are still not lonely. The Oujiang and Ningbo merchants shipped out more than 200 boxes, with very few additions. Customers from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Singapore are more interested in light-colored cloth, with about 1,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, white-ground printed cloth, and satin being traded.

Eastern Cloth

The morning market opened with prices of fine cloth and fine twill shouted higher (per piece) by about 5 cents, but then fell back. The market rallied slightly in the afternoon, but in the end, there was not much difference from the sales prices on Saturday of last week. 12-pound Colorful Ball and Yanghe fine cloth were both priced at 11.25 yuan, Dragon Head at 11.225 yuan, and Dragon Head fine twill at 10.09 yuan. Tianjin merchants imported more than 500 packages of fine cloth and fine twill of various brands. Local dye-ready goods business and retail wholesale also purchased about 500-600 pieces. The market is still considered firm and stable.

Export

Today, 440 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Shantou, 30 pieces to Hong Kong, 55 pieces to Haikou, and 90 pieces to Haiphong.

### The Impact of Debt Interest Issues on the Market

Yesterday, the various markets in Shanghai were affected by the debt interest issue: the exchange rate of drafts and the discount rate of bills increased by 1.5 yuan, the settlement business of cotton yarn suddenly increased, and selling prices fell by 5, 6, and 7 yuan each. Raw silk moved towards a high peak, soaring by 17 yuan. Foreign firms increased their remittance settlements, scrambling to buy in. Even British and American gold tickets and gold pounds rose sharply. This shows the public's panic, which is actually unnecessary.

Opinions on Improving Today's Pharmaceutical Education ... Gai Bo

Idle Talk about Vaccination ... Xie Yunshou

B. The Situation of B.C.G. Vaccination in Shanghai

### Commentary: Opinions on Improving Today's Pharmaceutical Education

— Gai Bo

The sound of a cannon in Lugou Bridge awakened the entire China from its sleep. We are striding towards the road of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction." A few days ago, the *Shen Bao* reported that the Ministry of Education intended to establish guidelines for wartime education and sought opinions from all parties. This precisely demonstrates the revolutionary Ministry of Education's forward-looking intention. I, being untalented, am writing down what I have seen, felt, and hoped for in pharmaceutical education, as a suggestion to the Ministry of Education.

China's pharmaceutical education only has a few years of history. During these few years, it has been neglected by many, who thought that pharmacy was merely an accessory to medicine and did not have a position worthy of attention. Since the outbreak of the war, pharmacy has been gradually valued because its need has increased sharply with the sudden increase in wounded soldiers and refugees, and the supplies, which originally relied on foreign sources, have instead sharply reduced their import volume. We have seen many refugees, in every bombing, pressing their wounds and shouting all day long, yet there were no painkillers to reduce their suffering. We have seen many brave soldiers, due to the lack of disinfectants, unnecessarily losing their lives due to small wounds while being injured for the sake of their country. We have seen a team of soldiers trembling in the battlefield due to the prevalence of malaria. Although enthusiastic doctors are willing to remove the chains of this disease for them, they are powerless due to the lack of quinine... These are all tragic events! The erroneous valuation of pharmacy in the past has now been exposed.

But unfortunately, the situation in Shanghai is still the same as before the war. Their curricula have not increased due to the needs of the war. Many mediocre professors still think that the only task of pharmacy students is to be pharmacists in a pharmacy, focusing on testing whether the medicines bought from abroad meet the specified content, as if pharmacy students are merely salesmen of foreign goods. This kind of colonial education error has long been exposed. But the pharmaceutical education in Shanghai has been wrong all along and has not been corrected.

The bell of the great era has already rung. Everything is moving along the road of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction." Undoubtedly, pharmaceutical education, which is of great importance, cannot be allowed to continue to be wrong. It must also follow this path. It needs the education of an independent country, producing as much of its own needed medicines as possible, to save many wounded soldiers and refugees and strengthen the effectiveness of the War of Resistance.

Although the lack of medicines is now greatly felt to be inconvenient and painful, and medicines are still able to be imported in small amounts because international shipping has not been cut off, opening our eyes and looking at the world situation, everyone is alarmed by the storm clouds in Europe, which may turn into a tempest one day. At that time, shipping will stop and the source of medicines will be completely cut off. If China is still like this in the future, none of us dare to imagine what a terrible and dead country China will become! Wise Ministry of Education, it is time to accelerate the cultivation of practical pharmaceutical talents.

Since current pharmaceutical education should follow the path of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction," then the attention of educators should shift from specializing in testing to specializing in manufacturing. What China urgently needs to do during the war is nothing more than two things: one is to imitate existing foreign medicines and manufacture them ourselves, and the other is to be able to use Chinese medicines as much as possible—a great legacy.

In order to manufacture medicines ourselves, attention should of course be paid to pharmaceutical manufacturing chemistry. Medicines are divided into organic and inorganic categories. Because the education of inorganic chemistry knowledge takes more time, students have a clearer concept in their minds. Generally speaking, the manufacture of inorganic medicines is much easier. As for organic chemistry knowledge, the pharmacy schools in Shanghai only have one and a half or two years of courses, and it is only general organic chemistry. Regarding organic analysis, although there are some scattered things in the organic part of pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmacy students should have systematic and complete organic analysis knowledge, and these scattered things are really useless. Organic synthesis is the most urgently needed at the current stage, but there is still no course setting for this in the pharmacy schools in Shanghai. Because current medicines are gradually trending towards the organic aspect, students are still looking forward to more advanced knowledge than organic chemistry.

As for the utilization of Chinese medicine, that is the knowledge of pharmacognosy. Everyone knows that this is a large pile of legacy left by many pharmacognosists since Shennong. There are both essential and worthless things in this legacy. Due to the lack of scientific knowledge of the predecessors, there has never been a systematic sorting work. So-called Chinese medicine is like a pile of disordered grass, difficult to sort out. And the students who take on this responsibility are at the forefront. Unfortunately, before the war, the sorting work of Chinese medicine suffered the same fate as the entire pharmacy, encountering neglect. When one counts the many people in North China, Southeast China, etc., who are concentrated in the provinces that famously produce Chinese medicine, such as Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, and sees so many people suffering unnecessarily due to the lack of medicines or even sacrificing their lives, while the whole pile of domestic herbal medicines cannot be used well, this is such an unreasonable, terrible, and contradictory situation. The students who bear the great responsibility of eliminating this contradiction also belong to pharmacy students. Looking at the pharmacy schools in Shanghai, the pharmacognosy they study is all foreign pharmacognosy. They have studied coca leaves, santonin flower medicine, watermelon, and coriander seeds, but they do not know *Angelica sinensis*, *Alisma plantago-aquatica*, *Platycodon grandiflorus*, *Adenophora stricta*, *Peucedanum praeruptorum*, and *Fritillaria cirrhosa*. They know foreign *Stephania tetrandra* and *Polygala tenuifolia*, but they do not know domestic *Stephania tetrandra* and *Polygala tenuifolia*. They do not even know whether the parts they use belong to the root, stem, flower, fruit, or seed. After pharmacy students trained in this way graduate, I ask, can they bear this burden? Therefore, in addition to pharmacognosy (specifically covering foreign herbal medicines), there must also be knowledge of Chinese medicine. Although this knowledge is still in its infancy, it is at least possible to make pharmacy students know whether the medicinal part of *Angelica sinensis* is the root or the stem.

Taking a step back, let us temporarily not use Chinese medicine. Then this knowledge of pharmacognosy is still not enough, because what is said in pharmacognosy is only the recognition of the morphology and structure and components of a herbal medicine, but it does not tell you how this herbal medicine is generated. It can give you the ability not to buy counterfeit products, but it cannot devise ways to transplant foreign goods to China, so that the same medicinal materials grow on Chinese territory. This is still just a salesperson of foreign goods, and there is still a risk of being cut off from medicines because we cannot be self-sufficient. Therefore, we also need to add "horticulture of medicinal materials."

In addition to the four courses mentioned above, which need to be added to adapt to the goal of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction," in order to increase efficiency, students and the school should also supervise each other to accelerate progress.

In the past, schools inviting professors could be said to worship the doctrine of doctors. If someone returned from abroad and had spent a few years living a bread-winning life, although they were mediocre and their knowledge was not enough to be competent as a professor, it seemed unimportant. However, the professor's title of doctor attracted the attention of the school very much. A professor like this only wastes students' time and money, blocks students' knowledge of this subject, and makes students feel bored with this subject.

A school is a large group. Students join this group to cultivate their wisdom. Professors in this group are people who guide students and enlighten students' wisdom. Students have the right to ask questions, and professors have the obligation to enlighten them. If this professor's own wisdom is not enough to guide students and enlighten students, but instead blocks students' enthusiasm for knowledge, then for the sake of students' own wisdom and the educational authorities' purpose of running the school, why do students not have the right to impeach these people who occupy positions without doing any real work? A professor who is half-baked can never give his students intellectual satisfaction.

Chinese youths have awakened. The prison of scores can no longer confine them. They have recognized justice. The wise authorities should know the new trend of young students and should no longer excessively misjudge their psychology with the concept of scores.

Students should have the right to impeach professors who occupy positions without doing any real work because the professor's talent directly affects the student's future. They do not demand that every professor be as erudite as Pasteur, Ehrlich, or Faraday. But at the very least, they should understand what they are teaching. If they cannot even be competent for these basic responsibilities, then they do not have the talent to guide and enlighten students' wisdom. I hope the educational authorities can authorize students to impeach these mediocre professors, so as not to waste students' time and money, block their wisdom, and cause unnecessary boredom, reducing the efficiency of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction."

In summary, I hope that after a pharmacy student graduates, they can stand on their own position and be competent for the task of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction," without learning something that is not used. Although this is a personal hope, I am sure it is also the urgent expectation of many pharmacy students. I hope the wise Ministry of Education will give it deep consideration.

Popular Medical Talks

### Smallpox Vaccination Chat

— Xie Yunchou

The purpose of this publication is originally to guide the public on basic knowledge of health from a scientific standpoint, and to correct the public's misconceptions about medicine. Recently, smallpox has been prevalent, and vaccination has become a widely known fact. There is no need to discuss "Smallpox Vaccination Chat" again. However, in fact, there are still various inconsistencies in the public's perception and techniques regarding vaccination. Therefore, I am using this column to inform readers.

(1) Is Vaccination Inoculating Poison? Vaccination to prevent smallpox is already well known to the general public. However, there are still some people who mistakenly believe that vaccination is "extracting poison," that is, after vaccination, the poison inside the body can be extracted, and from then on, the occurrence of smallpox can be avoided. This is indeed a misconception. The occurrence of smallpox is caused by the transmission of smallpox pathogens, not poison inherited by the infant from the mother, nor poison produced by the infant itself that can be excreted through vaccination.

(2) How Can Vaccination Prevent Smallpox? This is called automatic immunity in medicine. Originally, when a certain foreign object invades the human body, a kind of antitoxin will be produced in the blood. For example, when substance A invades, an antitoxin for substance A will be produced. After being vaccinated with cowpox, an antitoxin against smallpox will be produced. When unfortunately infected with smallpox pathogens, the blood contains an antitoxin against smallpox, which can avoid the occurrence of smallpox. The cholera prevention injection in summer has the same meaning. Also, if you are vaccinated quickly after contact with a smallpox patient, it is still effective because the vaccination will take effect within seven days, and the incubation period of smallpox is ten to thirteen days.

(3) Why Do You Need to Be Vaccinated Multiple Times? The duration of the antitoxin mentioned above in the body is uncertain. Some last very long, some very short. The defense of vaccination lasts up to ten years. If the antitoxin disappears early, smallpox can still occur even after vaccination. Therefore, the law stipulates that newborns should be vaccinated for the first time within six months of birth, and vaccinated for the second time at the age of ten. However, when smallpox is prevalent, those who have been vaccinated for five years, or when the vaccination does not take effect (that is, insensitive or non-sensitive), should be vaccinated again.

(4) Should People Who Have Had Variolation and the Elderly Be Vaccinated? We know from the facts that after having true smallpox once, it is rare to be infected with smallpox again. The so-called variolation is an old method from ancient India and our country, which is to artificially inoculate the scabs of smallpox into the nasal cavity of healthy people, causing symptoms similar to smallpox, but the symptoms are milder than true smallpox. However, how much immunity it has and whether it is longer than vaccination with cowpox, we dare not assert. But in fact, people who have had variolation can still be infected with smallpox. Therefore, people who have had variolation should still not be careless and should be vaccinated again. According to the unreliability of variolation mentioned above and the possibility of the disappearance of antitoxins, the elderly should also be vaccinated again during the period when smallpox is prevalent for safety.

(5) Variolation Should Be Strictly Prohibited. The quality of cowpox vaccine can be controlled by management methods. For example, whether the cow is healthy and whether the disinfection during manufacturing is complete. However, variolation is the practice of ignorant doctors preserving and applying smallpox scabs. Not only are the symptoms more dangerous than cowpox when it occurs, but it can also transmit other viruses. If the scabs they preserve come from children with viruses, such as the transmission of syphilis, the medical records are undoubtedly true. Therefore, in remote areas, because cowpox vaccine is not available, or people who are stubborn and superstitious believe that variolation is better than cowpox, and use outdated and dangerous methods, shouldn't this be strictly prohibited?

### Medical News: The Situation of BCG Vaccination in Shanghai

It is well known that B.C.G. has the effect of preventing tuberculosis. Now, the Pasteur Institute in Shanghai has been engaged in manufacturing it. Since March of the 26th year of the Republic of China, infant vaccinations have been carried out in the obstetrics department of Guangci Hospital. As of October of last year, a total of 800 infants have been vaccinated. The method of vaccination is very simple. Half an hour before breastfeeding in the morning on the third, fifth, and seventh day after the infant is born, mix the total amount of bacteria contained in an ampoule with warm milk and let the infant drink it. After the infant takes it, there is no local or systemic reaction, and there is no any impact on the digestive system. Physicians in this city who need B.C.G. vaccine can directly contact the Pasteur Institute on Jin Shenfu Road. The institute can provide it free of charge, but this vaccine is a live vaccine and cannot be stored for a long time. It cannot be used after eight days, otherwise the vaccination will be ineffective. This should be noted.

### Unified Government Bonds Due at the End of the Month Will Be Paid in Chongqing Instead; Shanghai Will Pay in Six Installments Over One Month; Customs Guarantee That Debts Will Not Be Overdrawn; Stock Market Transactions Plunged Yesterday

Since the Ministry of Finance issued a notice that customs-guaranteed bonds will no longer be allowed to be overdrawn, the price of unified government bonds on the informal securities trading market in Shanghai has plummeted. As for the principal and interest of the unified government bonds due at the end of this month, totaling 51,128,300 yuan, it has been decided that the Central Bank will pay as usual, but the payment will be made by the Chongqing head office. The details are as follows:

No Overdrafts Allowed

The Ministry of Finance issued a notice that for all customs-guaranteed bonds borrowed before the war that have not been repaid, the amount that should be allocated proportionally from the customs revenue outside the war zone should be transferred to the Central Bank for special deposit on a regular basis. However, this allocation method is only a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary situation. If the customs in the war zone later deliver the outstanding and unpaid indemnity and the allocated amount of subsequent tax revenue to the General Administration of Customs as before, the bond fund should still be allocated as before at the same time to restore the pre-war situation. In order to maintain domestic and foreign credit and protect the interests of bondholders, the Central Bank has advanced overdrafts of 175 million yuan. No further overdrafts will be allowed in the future. It is reported that banks, money shops, and bondholders generally consider the Ministry of Finance's handling method to be appropriate. Regarding the repayment of principal and interest of the unified government bonds due at the end of January, because the lottery has already been drawn, it has been decided to repay on schedule and not adopt the method of proportional allocation of customs revenue.

Customs-Guaranteed Bonds

Domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties. As of the end of June 1937 for foreign debts: the 1898 Anglo-German loan of £4,308,025, the 1913 Reorganization Loan of £20,178,860, and the Wheat and Cotton Loan of US$14,700,000. As of the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China for domestic debts: the total issuance of the Unified Government Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China was 146 million yuan, with debts of 143,850,000 yuan for Type A, 146,250,000 yuan for Type B, 341,250,000 yuan for Type C, 536,250,000 yuan for Type D, and 253,500 yuan for Type E, totaling 1,421,100,000 yuan. The issuance of the Rehabilitation Government Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China was 34 million yuan, with debts of 33,750,000 yuan. The issuance of the Long-Term Financial Government Bonds of the 17th year of the Republic of China was 45 million yuan, with debts of 33,150,000 yuan.

Stock Market Plunges

The informal securities trading market on the seventh floor of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only allows spot transactions. Originally, there were two trading sessions at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm. Yesterday, the trading of unified government bonds on this market experienced a price drop in all five types (A, B, C, D, and E) due to the Ministry of Finance's statement that customs-guaranteed bonds would not be allowed to be overdrawn. The following is a comparison of the market prices last Saturday and yesterday: Type A: (Last) 62.3 yuan, (Yesterday) 56.5 yuan; Type B: (Last) 54.7 yuan, (Yesterday) 50 yuan; Type C: (Last) 53.1 yuan, (Yesterday) 49 yuan; Type D: (Last) 52 yuan, (Yesterday) 48.5 yuan; Type E: (Last) 52.25 yuan, (Yesterday) 48.6 yuan. However, the spot transactions yesterday decreased significantly compared to before.

Shanghai Pays in Installments

According to reliable information obtained from financial circles, the unified government bonds of types A, B, C, D, and E, including the drawn bonds and six interest payments, will be paid as usual on the 31st of this month. However, it has been decided to change the payment to be made by the head office of the Central Bank in Chongqing, and there will be no installments. The full amount will be received after deducting only the interest income tax. However, the exchange rate between Chongqing and Shanghai requires a premium of 150 yuan per thousand yuan. The three branches of the Central Bank in Shanghai can collect the payment on behalf of the bondholders. Those who wish to collect the payment from the three branches of the Central Bank in Shanghai will receive it in six installments, with each installment being one month. As for the detailed methods of payment in Chongqing and payment in installments in Shanghai, the head office of the Central Bank has formulated them and the Ministry has approved them, but they have not yet been issued to Shanghai.

### Japanese Residents Advocate Postponing Payment of Municipal Council Land Tax from This Year to 1941 and Advocate Requesting Reassessment of Land Value Tax

According to the Continental News, the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported yesterday (the 15th) that Japanese residents and property owners in this city started a campaign on Saturday (the 14th) to postpone the payment of land tax to the Municipal Council from January 1st of this year to June 30th, 1941. The Shanghai Japanese Residents Land Owners Association held a meeting on Saturday, lasting three hours, advocating the reassessment of the value of land owned by Japanese residents. The current tax is the land tax of 1936, which is based on the land value surveyed as far back as 1933. Japanese residents and property owners originally advocated not paying land tax in January of last year, but because some property owners had already paid the land tax when this proposal was made, the campaign failed. Under normal circumstances, the Japanese residents' payment to the Municipal Council, which is only the land tax, reaches 350,000 yuan annually. The newspaper further acknowledged that even if the property owners' request for postponement can be realized, the economic benefits they gain are also minimal. However, the success of this negotiation can have beneficial repercussions in the Japanese mainland. The newspaper further stated that the Japanese residents' request for the Municipal Council to consider is based on "the new situation created in this city after the Japanese army and navy made valuable sacrifices."

### President Pierce Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow; Departs for Hong Kong and Little Luzon on the 20th at 8:00 AM

The American President Lines' ships stopped operating on the Far East routes after the August 13th Incident two years ago. After more than a year, the company was reorganized in October of last year and renamed the American President Lines. At the same time, it planned to resume the Far East routes, etc., as previously reported. Now it is learned that the first ship to arrive in Shanghai to resume the Far East routes is the President Pierce, which set sail from San Francisco on the 30th of last month. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 18th), but due to slight delays in the ports along the way, it has been delayed by one day. It departs from Kobe today and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at noon on the 19th, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. The passenger launch departs from the Xinguang Wharf at 11:30 am. The ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Little Luzon at 8:00 am on the 20th. The passenger launch departs from the Xinguang Wharf at 1:00 am on the evening of the 19th. After arriving at Little Luzon, the ship returns to the United States, passing through Hong Kong and Japan, without stopping in Shanghai.

### Uninterrupted Arrival of European Immigrants in Shanghai; Aid Difficulties; International Relief Society Approaching Collapse; No Concrete Assistance from New York and London

According to the Continental News, although the immigrant residences in this city are full and insufficient, two more batches of German Jewish immigrants arrived in Shanghai at the end of last week. The first batch of 44 people was carried by a certain Japanese cargo ship from Dalian and arrived in port on the evening of Saturday (the 14th). The second batch was larger in number, arriving on the Italian postal ship Victoria yesterday morning (the 15th), totaling

Two Hundred and Forty People

including two children. These newly arrived immigrants are temporarily residing in Riverside Mansion. Last night, a senior official of the committee said that the refugee relief committee is approaching collapse. Shanghai cannot take care of them. The people of Shanghai have done what they can and will do their best to provide assistance to these unfortunate people, but this is a

Worldwide Justice

issue, not just an issue for war-torn Shanghai. To date, no concrete assistance has been received from New York and London. According to reports, including the newly arrived, there will be 1,800 Jewish immigrants in Shanghai. According to rumors, 300 of these immigrants will

Be Allowed to Move to Tianjin

However, according to a member of the relief committee, no official notification has been received regarding the permission for Jewish refugees to move to Tianjin. Most of those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday came from Berlin and Vienna, and most of them were dressed elegantly, carrying a large amount of luggage, mostly shop owners, clerks, and merchants, etc.

### Domestic Air Parcels; Post Office Suspends Sending Due to Scarcity of Aircraft and Transportation Difficulties

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received a report from the Hong Kong Postal Administration that due to the scarcity of aircraft flights and transportation difficulties, air parcels forwarded to various places have accumulated like mountains. From now on, the acceptance of domestic air parcels to Wanxian, Chongqing, Chengdu, Luzhou, Xuzhou, Jiading, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, Ningxia, Wuzhou, Guilin, Liuzhou, Changsha and other places will be suspended. After receiving the report, the Shanghai Post Office suspended the acceptance of these parcels from yesterday and issued a notice from the Parcel Post Group stating, "Due to transportation difficulties and the scarcity of aircraft, the acceptance of all air parcels to various places is temporarily suspended from today." It is said that acceptance will resume in two weeks.

### Traitors and Soldiers of Fortune Rampant in Changkuncheng Three Counties; Chinese Army Prepares to Encircle and Suppress; Xiong Jiandong's Forces Have Advanced to Areas Along the Yangtze River; The Soldiers of Fortune Under the Command of Zhang Mufang Have Mutinied

Xu Fengzao, Zhao Peizhi, Yang Xingfang, and others, the "Pacification Team Leaders" of Changshu, Kunshan, and Chengxiang counties, willingly driven by the enemy, recognizing the thief as their father, and endangering the locality. The Chinese army stationed north and south of the Yangtze River has reached a grand alliance, determined to suppress them severely. Zhang Mufang's soldiers of fortune in Hupu, on the other hand, are cooperating with the Chinese army and have mutinied one after another. The details are as follows:

Appointed as Traitorous Officials

Zhao Peizhi, Yi Hualong, Zhao Peifang, local hooligan Xu Fengzao of Jiangbei, and Yang Xingfang, commander of the 6th Detachment of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army of the former Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee, and others, have recently been used by the Japanese side to accept traitorous appointments as "Pacification Team Leaders" of Changshu, Kunshan, and Jiangyin counties, recruiting more than a thousand local bandits, ruffians, and vagrants, distributing them in the Hupu and Zhangjiagang areas, recognizing the thief as their father, seeking refuge with the Japanese side, committing all kinds of evils, kidnapping people for ransom, forcibly robbing women, endangering the locality, and being extremely unlawful.

Joint Suppression

Since Zhao and others defected, they have gone to great lengths to curry favor with the Japanese side, even accepting enemy conspiracies and implementing the poisonous plan of using Chinese to control Chinese. Various regular Chinese armies, including Xiong Jiandong and Cai Runqi, jointly persuaded them to rein in their horses, hoping they would repent, but Zhao and others were willing to be lackeys of the tiger, not only refusing to wake up and repent but intensifying their efforts, harming innocent people, killing young patriotic youths, and so on, one after another. Therefore, Xiong, Cai, and others, unable to bear it any longer, will unite with the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu to suppress them severely. It is now learned that Xiong's forces have advanced to areas along the Yangtze River and the urban area, and battles in Hupu, Yinsha, and other places are about to break out.

Zhang's Soldiers Mutiny

Zhang Mufang, who was once the brigade commander of the traitorous "Pacification Team," had no choice but to associate with Zhao and Yang on the surface due to the surrounding environment, in order to cope with the situation, but secretly cooperated with Xiong and Cai early on, maintaining close contact. Part of the traitorous Pacification Team under Zhang's command has mutinied, and the rest remain stationed along the port, waiting for an opportunity to respond, so as to eliminate all bandits and traitors. According to people from the interior, because the Japanese side lacks sufficient troops to control, it is using traitors to do their utmost to win over bandit troops, reorganize them, and send them to various ports and urban areas for garrison. Only a hundred or so Japanese soldiers remain in the urban area, responsible for monitoring the actions of the bandit traitorous armies.

### Rickshaw Association Representatives Petition the Municipal Council; Request Exemption from Trimming Handles and Modifying Wheels; Chief of the Vehicle Department Agrees to Forward to the Bureau for Consideration

The Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association of this city reported that because the Municipal Council shortened the handles of rickshaws and ordered the modification of rubber wheel edges, they were unable to obtain operating licenses, causing panic in their livelihoods, and requested relief. The association convened a temporary general meeting of directors and supervisors at its association at No. 24 Furun Lane, Guizhou Road, the night before, and notified the members to register to consolidate mutual aid strength. At 2:00 pm yesterday, representatives were sent to the Municipal Council to petition. The details are as follows:

Emergency Meeting

The association's temporary emergency meeting held that the Municipal Council's shortening of rickshaw handles and forcing the widening of iron wheel edges hindered the members' work and affected their livelihoods. The association had previously written to the bureau requesting that the original appearance be maintained, but there had been no response, causing panic among the members, and the situation was becoming increasingly serious. Members came to the association one after another to request negotiations, and it was decided to send Secretary-General Ge Futian to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession to state the difficult livelihood situation of the members.

Notice to Members

Since the August 13th Incident, there have been many changes in the association's membership. Members are hereby notified that the registration of members will be re-organized from today, with the association located at No. 24, Lane 290, Guizhou Road, Beijing Road, and will be open as usual. In order to care for the members, the arrears of membership fees after the war will be waived. Regarding the Municipal Council's shortening of rickshaw handles and ordering the modification of wide iron wheels, the matter is closely related to the vital interests of the industry, and colleagues still need to automatically unite and contact each other to consolidate the strength of mutual aid and jointly respond.

Representatives Petition

At 2:00 pm yesterday, Zou Shisong, Ke Huaxin, and Gao Youyu were selected as representatives, accompanied by Secretary-General Ge Futian, to petition the Municipal Council. The representatives first visited Deputy Director-General He De Kui and explained everything. They then went to the Vehicle Department, where they were received by Director Baker. The representatives explained in detail the difficult livelihood of the rickshaw pullers, their inability to modify the wheels, and the various inconveniences after shortening the handles. The Chief of the Vehicle Department agreed to forward it to the bureau for consideration.

### Central Government Rectifies Party Discipline; Party Workers Must Not Leave Their Posts Without Authorization; Those Who Do Will Be Investigated by Party Committees at All Levels and Replaced

The Central Executive Committee recently ordered party committees at all levels that during the national crisis, all party workers should redouble their efforts and be at the forefront of the people. Recently, among the members of party committees at all levels, some have been officially appointed but do not report to their posts without asking for leave, or make excuses not to go, or even if they report to their posts, they do not work at the party committee's location. There are also those who have been resolved to be sent to guide outer counties, but they make excuses not to set off even though they do not hold important military or political positions. In this situation, there is no party discipline to speak of, which greatly hinders the progress of party affairs. Party committees at all levels should investigate and replace those who do so. For those working comrades who leave their posts without authorization without following the leave regulations, the chairmen should strictly prohibit them. Orders have already been issued to the party committees of all provinces and counties to comply with and instruct their subordinates to comply with uniformly.

### French Newspaper Reports That Southwest China's Transportation Construction Will Never Again Be Blockaded by the Japanese, Strengthening the Belief That Resistance Will Surely Be Won

The French-language Shanghai Daily News reported that the southwestern provinces of China are currently rushing to build two railway lines to reach foreign countries, one from Kunming directly to Burma and the other from Kunming directly to Suifu, Sichuan. It is reported that the former is 713 kilometers long and the latter is 774 kilometers long, which will be fully completed in 1941. This "hinterland" of China will never again be blockaded by the Japanese, and the Chinese people's fierce construction of these two transportation routes further shows their belief that resistance will surely be won, which will become more and more firm. It is reported that in addition to these two railway lines, several highways are being built to connect Kunming and Burma, one of which is a main road that can be opened to traffic as early as May this year. After the road is built, if 100 trucks transport goods on it every day, each truck can carry 200 tons, and millions of tons of military supplies can be easily and quickly transported. It is a pity that this road will inevitably have some traffic limitations when the dry season begins. It is also reported that the British loan of 100,000 pounds will be used entirely for the purchase of vehicles. According to foreign sources, since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the British trade in the Yangtze River and the Xijiang River has declined greatly. Now, they may be able to rely on these new southwestern transportation routes to make up for their losses.

### Father Rhaou Brings Refugee Fund; Will Do His Best to Find Work for Refugees; Prevent Reception Centers from Becoming Social Blights

According to the Continental News, Father Rhaou returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) from the interior. He said that Madame Chiang Kai-shek is very active in caring for and educating Chinese refugees in her current work. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is currently traveling all over the country and is extremely busy. Although the Chairman and his wife have very little free time, they still cordially received him. Father Rhaou's return to Shanghai this time has

Chairman and Wife's

photograph with personal signatures and a large sum of money from the Central Government to Father Rhaou to be used as a refugee fund, which is the harvest of Father Guan's trip. Father Rhaou added that Chongqing itself has very few signs of war, but the government and the public have expressed their determination to work hard and with one heart. Guilin is a

Beautiful Small City

which is now half destroyed. Father Zhao replied to the question about a number of Italian priests engaged in espionage in northern Hunan, "I don't believe it. The matter has been investigated, and I personally believe that the truth will come out about what happened. I admire the refugee relief work done by the American Catholic Church in Hankou, which is led by Bishop Ah Luo, who is an American. The refugees and the Japanese army are suffering from malaria. The Chinese authorities in the interior are doing their best to send refugees to

Suitable Work

areas. This is a smart policy. Now that I have come to Shanghai, I will also do my best to find appropriate work for refugees in this city and seek to prevent refugee reception centers from gradually becoming social blights through the use of labor."

### Global Wireless Electric Company Responds to Debt Repayment Campaign

The Chinese, American, and British employees of the Global Wireless Electric Company, located at 51 Guangdong Road, in view of the news that the One Yuan Debt Repayment Campaign has been widely supported, voluntarily donated 39 yuan in cash and entrusted it to the bank for remittance yesterday (the 16th) (obtained Remittance Order No. 784). Although the amount of this donation is small, it is commendable even compared to foreign aid. It is difficult and valuable enough, and it is hoped that the future will be brighter.

### Fellow Traders Participating in Illegal Exchanges Will Be Severely Sanctioned in Accordance with the Regulations; The Ministries of Finance and Economics Have Already Launched an Investigation; Sales Contracts Are Denied

The Ministries of Finance and Economics believed that the operation of exchanges should not be operated by foreign merchants, and any attempts by foreign merchants to set up exchanges in Shanghai should be strictly prohibited. Chinese merchants participating in such illegal organizations are clearly attempting to manipulate and disrupt finances and should be punished in accordance with the law to serve as a warning. The two ministries jointly sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice and Administration to investigate the tissue market in accordance with the law, and for the conditions of brokerage disputes in the exchange, if those who are not sold in the exchange established in accordance with the law, their sales behaviors and their contracts should be considered invalid. All industries in Shanghai must not participate in such unauthorized organizations, and if there are violations of the rules, severe sanctions will be imposed in accordance with the rules of the association.

### Wartime Shanghai Postal Service

— Not Classical

Among the national government organs on today's "isolated island," the only ones that can maintain their relatively complete structures in the face of a precarious situation are the Postal Service and the Customs Office. Since the raising of the five-colored flag in Shanghai, the old prestige has gradually declined. Only the Postal Service has been able to calmly cope and stand on its own. Tracing back the reasons, there are several factors: first, the consistency of international relations; second, the needs of society; third, the efforts of postal workers; and fourth, the appropriate handling by the postal authorities. Lacking any one of these four, the Postal Service would not be able to have its current appearance. This can be definitively stated. However, there have been inevitable changes in the minor branches and details. The national economy is difficult, and attention should be paid to it. Therefore, based on what I know, I will describe them in the following points, titled "Wartime Shanghai Postal Service," so that we can learn from the past and distinguish the future.

A Brief History of the Postal Service

To understand the current state of the Postal Service, one must first trace its evolution. The development of postal communications in China began in the Zhou Dynasty, either by foot or by horse. Successive dynasties followed suit, with few advancements. It was not until after the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty that merchant disasters arose. In response to the needs of commerce, private letter offices were established, densely distributed in various locations, interconnected, delivering letters, and delivering silver, which was convenient for merchants. During the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, the court added a bureau for official documents, specializing in distributing official documents for government officials. The postal delivery continued by the customs office also began to accept letters from the people. This was the beginning of the postal service trial. Before this, foreigners, because they considered China without a postal service, and international communication inconvenient, had set up letter offices in treaty ports to handle letters between their countries. Until the establishment of the Chinese postal service, and because of the imperfect system, these continued to grow. The Qing court thought of ways to resist them, consulting in many ways. It was not until February of the 22nd year of Guangxu that the official postal service was finally established. Although the post office had been established, foreign post offices competed, and postal administration was not unified. After several negotiations, it was still not completely resolved. Throughout the Qing Dynasty, they had to be dealt with. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, China requested the abolition of foreign post offices at the Universal Postal Congress. The following year, the United States convened a military disarmament conference, and China reiterated this request. In November, the Committee on Pacific and Far Eastern Questions met, and various organizations accepted this request and abolished them one after another in December of the 11th year of the Republic of China. China then joined the international postal alliance and actively cooperated with the Universal Postal Union. Shortly after the September 18th Incident, the postal area of the three northeastern provinces, which had an annual surplus of two million, was occupied, and the postal economy was greatly affected. In January of the 24th year of the Republic of China, private letter offices throughout the country were acquired by the government and completely shut down. The postal authorities accumulated plans to improve the postal economy, reduce expenses, streamline the organization, and rectify corruption. The combination of various measures compensated for the losses. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the surplus reached six to seven million. Post offices in various locations were further developed. Soon, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the impact continued to come.

Wartime Relocation

After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, because the post office was located on North Sichuan Road, close to the Japanese defense zone, rumors arose for a time. However, all postal workers, under the leadership of the director, were able to work calmly. In addition to closing the front doors along North Sichuan Road and Tianmu Road, internal work proceeded as usual. After the August 14th air battle, the Japanese military controlled the lights in the Hongkou district, which hindered the evening work of the post office. During the day, the receipt and dispatch of letters was slow because people were unwilling to go to dangerous areas. The branches in the special zone suddenly became busy. Therefore, on August 16th, the authorities ordered the business and economic departments to be relocated to the following branches for operation:

(1) Yu Garden Road (i.e., the new site of the Jing'an Temple Branch)

(2) Avenue Petain Branch

(3) Jiangxi Road Storage Bureau

With Yu Garden Road as the hub. As for the branches in the local area close to the war zone, such as Tilanqiao, Jielu, and North Sichuan Road branches, they were also suspended. Mail from these branches was collected and left at Avenue Edward VII, Route Cardinal Mercier, Rue Cardinal Foch, and Jing'an Temple Road branches for collection. As for the North Sichuan Road Management Bureau, in addition to the doors being closed, personnel were still sent to guard the premises on a daily basis, rotating in shifts. The director treated the guards as equal to soldiers on the front lines in terms of compensation, saying that guarding the post office was no different from defending the battlefield. Therefore, the driving motive was entirely to facilitate the public. Although the war was extremely fierce, the guarding of the Management Bureau never ceased for a single day.

Establishment and Dissolution of Military Post

During the intense warfare, many troops were stationed in the suburbs. To facilitate the delivery and forwarding of soldiers' letters, a military post group was established in September of the 26th year. Later, as the troops retreated westward, most of the personnel of the group also left with them. Consequently, it was announced that it would be dissolved in December.

Discount on Employee Salaries

After the outbreak of the war of resistance, the war zone expanded, and the postal revenue suddenly decreased. The ministry ordered that postal employees' salaries be discounted starting in January. In addition to a living allowance of forty yuan, salaries in non-war zones were reduced by 40%, and those in war zones by 20%. In February of the 27th year, it was revised to a living allowance of thirty yuan. Salaries below 150 yuan were reduced by 20%, those between 150 and 300 yuan by 30%, and those above 300 yuan by 40%. There were two more revisions in April and May. In June, it was further revised to a living allowance of forty yuan, with salaries below 190 yuan reduced by 20%, and those above 190 yuan reduced by 30%. Currently, there are no changes. In February, a plan to evacuate employees was also discussed, dividing them into "enemy-occupied" and "waiting at home." This was opposed by all employees, and the matter was not implemented. Instead, some people were instigated to become traitors and distribute leaflets, intending to stir up trouble and profit from it. However, because all employees understood the greater good and were not swayed, all difficulties were safely overcome. (To be continued)

Threatened and Blackmailed for Introducing Lawsuits, With Bullets as Gifts

Ji Xiao was not only extorted but also falsely accused. Zhang Guohua, an employee of the Empress Theatre, was arrested.

Ji Wanfeng, residing at No. 6, Lane 81, Peng Road, has been enthusiastically involved in legal matters in recent years, inevitably incurring both gratitude and resentment. At about 8:00 a.m. on the 3rd of this month, a man suddenly arrived at his home, offering a box of pastries as a gift. Ji was still asleep, and Ji's wife had gone to the market to buy vegetables. Ji's mother-in-law was alone in the living room. The man handed her the box and left. When Ji's wife returned, she temporarily placed the box in a drawer. When Ji got up, his wife told him about it. Ji curiously opened the box and discovered

Five Bullets

Scattered inside the box. He immediately reported the incident to the police station under the jurisdiction of the French Concession for investigation. Up to this day, Ji grasped a clue from Xi Runchu and asked the police to send detectives to the Empress Theatre of the New World on Yu Qiaqing Road, where they arrested Zhang Tiehua, an employee of Suzhou origin. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Dai opened the court for interrogation. After the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, he requested a postponement because the case still needed investigation. The defendant firmly denied the accusation. The prosecutor submitted a case by the plaintiff Ji Xiaofeng, stating that after the incident of finding bullets in the box,

The Whole Situation

He said that he had no grudges with anyone outside of work, so he did not know who was behind it. However, at noon on the 5th, he suddenly received a threatening phone call, saying that he must not go out today, as there was a great danger waiting for him. However, because he needed to go to a certain lawyer's office to discuss fees for introducing a case, he first notified the lawyer by phone and then went. He told the lawyer about the incident. The lawyer immediately asked about the people who threatened him and warned Wang Yigong, who made the phone call, not to act rashly. But on the 8th, he received another phone call. At first, he wanted to go to the Youth Association, then he was taken to the

Oriental Hotel

room, where the other party, Mr. Yu and a Mr. Gao, who did not speak, demanded 2,800 yuan from him. He then accused Zhang Guohua of being an accessory in the case of Wang Yigong threatening him. Wang Yigong was at the Youth Association, directing by phone. On the day of the negotiation, he was willing to settle for one or two hundred yuan, but the other party repeatedly demanded more, insisting on 1,800 yuan, and no agreement was reached. Later, Zhang testified in the Second Special Court that he was the instigator. The day before yesterday, because someone said that Xi Runchu had witnessed the person who delivered the cake, he repeatedly inquired with Xi. At first, he was unwilling to speak directly, but later agreed to guide the detectives to the

Empress Theatre

to search, and then clearly identified the defendant, etc. When questioned, Zhang stated that the police had recently been investigating Chen, his boss, for threatening him. According to Chen, he was Ji Xiaofeng's follower. Ji had visited his house several times on the 27th and 28th of last month, but he did not know Ji at all. The threatening case that the police are now prosecuting has not yet been concluded, etc. Zhang still refused to admit that he had sent the cake to Ji's house, as he had done at the police station. Judge Dai Rongduo, considering the complexity of the case, ordered Ji Xiaofeng to submit a detailed account of the incident in writing for further investigation. The defendant, Zhang Guohua, was taken back to the police station for detention, and the hearing was postponed pending investigation. A small motorboat, belonging to Nisshin Shadu, moored near the Dongma Wharf in the Huangpu River, suddenly exploded at 9:21 p.m. on Saturday (the 14th). Within ten minutes, the bottom of the boat was pierced, and it sank immediately. Several crew members were rescued by the Jianghai Customs small vessel, but one Japanese was killed.

Car Accident at Rue Bourgeat Kills Young Man on Bicycle

A young man in his twenties was riding a bicycle at the intersection of Rue Bourgeat and Rue Amiral Bayle at 3:45 p.m. yesterday when he was struck by a public bus. He sustained serious injuries and was sent to the Baolong Hospital by officer No. 2777 of the Chinese police force. He died before reaching the hospital due to the severity of his injuries. The body was transferred to the morgue.

Russian Sentenced to Three Months for Assaulting Hospital Director

Wang Simo, the director of the Second Special District Local Court, was driving his own car, No. 11857, with his driver Yao Rongfu, a Ningbo native, at 1:00 p.m. this month. As they entered Lane 6, No. 79, Rue du Consulat, a private residence, and reached the second side lane, a drunken Russian, Yevgeni Ivanchugov, (31 years old, residing at No. 1337 Rue Amiral Bayle), was

Standing in the Road

Blocking the car's passage. The driver Yao Rongfu rebuked him, but the Russian began to assault Yao, causing injuries. Director Wang, witnessing the scene from inside the car, got out and questioned him in English. The Russian not only refused to obey but also punched Wang in the head, shattering his glasses. The police arrived and arrested the Russian. Wang and Yao declined to press charges, but the driver Yao Rongfu, because of his

The Russian, after being investigated by the police, was found to have been previously fined 60 yuan by the Second Special District Court for assaulting someone. He was immediately sent to the Second Special District Court. The administrative authorities of the French Concession filed a public lawsuit against him for assault. Judge Qiu Huan Ying held two hearings, and the plaintiff Yao Rongfu also appeared in court to describe the assault. The defendant admitted to being drunk and could not deny it.

At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, Judge Qiu delivered the verdict in the criminal court, sentencing Yevgeni Ivanchugov to three months of imprisonment for assault. During the appeal period, the defendant will remain in custody.

Chauffeur of Yuan Lao Liu Sold Car for Embezzlement Case Concluded

Chauffeur and related persons directly admitted to the truth. All defendants were remanded for sentencing on the 23rd. Liang Alin, a Shanghai native, the chauffeur hired by Yuan Shikai's sixth son Yuan Lao Liu, fraudulently claimed to Kunlin, his neighbor on Rue du Consulat, to Hu, a chauffeur employed by Tian Baixiang of Jardine Matheson & Co. on Rue du Consulat, that his employer's car was for sale. Hu, knowing that his employer intended to purchase a vehicle, immediately paid Liang a deposit of 200 yuan,

Believing it to be true, as a deposit. Subsequently, negotiations took place, and on the 8th of this month, the agreed-upon price was 3,500 yuan. However, after receiving the payment, he failed to deliver the car. Tian Baixiang's son, You Nian, reported Liang to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police dispatched detectives and arrested Liang, Qi Cao Cailin and Zhao Maolin, who were suspected of conspiracy. All the money was recovered from Cao's residence and sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday morning, Judge Di Rongfeng conducted a trial

Defendant Brought to Court

And continued the interrogation of Liang, Cao, and Zhao. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the recovered 3,500 yuan had been fully returned to Tian Baixiang. As for the 200 yuan received earlier, according to Liang's own confession, he had lost it all in the gambling den in Yidingcheng Wucaojie, so the money could not be recovered. When questioned, Liang Alin confessed that he had initially made a joke about his employer wanting to sell the car, but Tian's chauffeur actually believed it and paid him a deposit of 200 yuan. He then gambled away the money, which prompted the idea of fraud, hoping to recover his losses through the fraudulently obtained money. Although he asked Cao to go to No. 75 Rue Moliere that day,

Cao was Unaware

He only told Cao that it was money earned from selling Tian's property when he asked him to take it back to hide. Cao Cailin admitted to hiding the money for Liang, but he was unaware of the fraud. After the cross-examination between the defendant's defense lawyer Fan Gangyin and the police lawyer concluded, the court ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody for sentencing on the 22nd of this month.

Fake Water Patrol Seizes Smuggled Raw Opium in Donggoupu

Over 1,000 Taels of Opium Seized, Japanese and Puppet Forces Disagree on Sharing the Spoils.

Amid the widespread drug promotion on the outskirts of Shanghai, raw opium is being smuggled into Shanghai. On the waterway, there are also Japanese and puppet forces, as well as gangsters from the Huangpu River, colluding to transport it. Yesterday morning, in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River in Donggoupu, a small boat of unknown nationality suddenly sped in from outside. After a while, about a dozen puppet "police局 water patrol队" puppet police officers, riding a small boat, drove from the upstream, meeting in Lai Gougang and forced the ship to stop. A large batch of raw opium, over a thousand taels, worth 15,000 yuan, was seized from the ship. The small boat was taken away, and the boatman was detained. The exact details of what was going on are unknown. It is said that the puppet side’s profit distribution was uneven, leading to mutual infighting, and this strange drama. It is reported that a yellow-hulled small boat with no name was detained by the puppet "water patrol force" at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. According to the puppet agency, the ship was privately transporting raw opium, but when they went to search, they found nothing, and three people on the ship had escaped. It is said that the opium had been transferred early, because local merchants along the Caojingdu一带, have special power. After this, opium entering, except for those protected by armed forces, will be intercepted. However, it is generally believed that this situation will soon change.

Until the day before yesterday, the 19-year-old Gu Xuezhen and the 20-year-old Sha Shunying went to Da Guangming Laundry to pick up clothes and were detained. The French police were notified, who informed the Chengdu Road Police Station. Chinese detective Che Xueceng went to arrest the two women.

### Amateur Performers Form Fundraising Association – Organization Established – All Theaters in the City Participate – Decision to Raise Donations to Run Activities

The Fundraising Committee of the Amateur Performers Group of the Municipal Refugee Relief Association, in order to adjust its organization and increase its strength, held a joint meeting of representatives of all theaters and amateur performers in the city at the Shipping Club at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Association, personally attended to provide guidance. The committee members were re-elected, the proposals were passed, and the formal establishment was announced. The details are as follows:

Participating Representatives

The representatives attending the meeting included Chairman of the Association Yu Qiaqing, Deputy Directors Jin Tingsun (represented by Jin Yuansheng), Yuan Ludeng, and representatives from various theaters, including Zhengyi Society, Letian Collection, Shengyi Society, Silver Industry, Times, Sheng Society, Zhongjiu Society, Liangyou, Donglian, Pharmacy Society, Ping Society, Leshan, Yi Society, Yayan, Dacheng, Siming, Guoju, Wuyun Collection, Yongheng Bank Club, Lianyi Lisha, Zhongnan, and Pinghe. Bao Youdie, Huang Xiubo, Jun Daren, Jiang Bogong, Fan Weilin, Xu Qinfang, Gua Dong, Li Yuanlong, Sun Junqing, Fa Laihui, Jia Yaying, and E Zhaoxiong, totaling over one hundred people.

Chairman's Address

Mr. Yuan Ludeng presided over the meeting. After the meeting began, the chairman delivered a speech, stating that since the Refugee Association officially declared its establishment on October 18th last year, it has received enthusiastic participation and donations from various industry groups and citizens throughout the city, resulting in remarkable achievements. Today, the Amateur Performers Group Fundraising Association is holding a general meeting, and everyone has been able to take time out of their busy schedules to attend, which is truly commendable. On behalf of the Association and the refugees throughout the city, I extend my deepest gratitude. The organization of the Amateur Performers Group was originally initiated by the Association and sponsored by Mr. Jin Tingsun. Therefore, the group began its work, and although the fundraising results have only been temporary, thanks to the efforts of the preparatory committee members, the donations have already exceeded ten thousand yuan. However, we dare not be complacent about this. In order to increase our fundraising strength, we hope that all amateur performers in the city will mobilize and participate enthusiastically to contribute to this righteous cause. Therefore, we believe that there is still a need to adjust the organizational approach, so we are reconvening this general meeting. We hope that everyone will uphold the spirit of doing good and not yielding to others, and make their greatest efforts for the refugees in Shanghai who are struggling and helpless. We are truly moved by your dedication. Mr. Sun Lanting reported on the organizational process and the amount of donations raised, omitting the details.

Mr. Yu's Instructions

Next, Chairman of the Association Yu Qiaqing gave instructions, stating that there are originally 100,000 refugees in the city, and the monthly food and clothing expenses require more than 300,000 yuan. Since the establishment of the Association, we have been actively working to reorganize and assist them. In addition to the refugee areas in the southern city, recent statistics on the refugees aided by the two concessions have shown that we have assisted over 40,000 people. With the strength of Shanghai's four million citizens, providing relief to over 40,000 refugees should not be too difficult. The Association's relief work focuses on the aftermath, and we plan to raise one million yuan to carry out the following plans:

(1) To establish more educational institutions for children to provide them with education. (2) To establish factories to enable adult refugees to engage in productive labor and earn a living. (3) The elderly, weak, and disabled will be fully supported by the Association. In addition, we also plan to establish more hospitals to pay attention to refugee hygiene in order to promote health. All of this requires the concerted efforts of enthusiastic people from all walks of life to complete this arduous mission.

Elected Committee Members

The re-election of the committee members resulted in the following: (Chairman) Jin Tingsun, (Vice-Chairman) Yuan Ludeng, (Committee Members) Sun Lanting, Jin Yuansheng, Bao Xiaodie, Yuan Senqi, Zhao Peijin, Wu Jiangfeng, Zai Qijun, Chao Jimei, Na Xujiu, Wu Laidai, Yao Shaobing, Huang Xiuqin, Zhang Zhongyuan, E Zhaoxiong, Sun Junqing, Luan Wu, Wu Yingsun, Xie Wenyuan, Gu Senbo, Cheng Junmou, Fan Weilin, Zhang Boge, Chuan Rushan, Hua Zhenya, Wang Yiqiu, Jiang Bogong, Zhang Zhesheng, Yu Yungu, Yin Zhenxian, Shao Daren, Luo Liangsheng, Xu Shaoping, Jiang Heshan, Wu Lizhi, Hu Fangguan, Cao Ke, Lu Moshen, Bai Yiliang, Zhu Yinliang, Liu Ruzhan, Zhu Jianhong, Chen Liangyu, Wu Kesun, Pang Bingxia, Rong Ruichang, Dai Xingyi, Bao Youdie, Zhang Yizhai, Cui Tixian, Li Jinxiang, Chen Chuan. In addition, the following were also elected: representatives from the Pinghe Racing Club, the Central Savings Society, the Mi Society, the Minghe, and the Central theaters.

Fundraising Methods

Next, the proposals were discussed. In addition to amending the articles of association, the committee also discussed how to raise funds. After discussion by the entire body, the following three principles were adopted:

(1) Theaters throughout the city will regularly hold charity performances for ten days, with the location at the former Golden Theater. (2) A general assembly will be held regularly, bringing together famous male and female performers in the city, and inviting sick performers to hold a Peking opera singing fundraising event for three days. (3) Amateur performers participating in celebratory performances should request the association's notice, and the association will solicit refugee donations from the middleman. All three of the above-mentioned methods were handed over to the committee for discussion and implementation.

It is reported that the committee has borrowed the Shipping Club as its office address, and has scheduled the first committee meeting for 6:00 PM on the 16th to divide up the work and actively carry it out.

### French Concession Authorities Prepare to Award Service Medals

According to the English-language "China Press", the Shanghai Municipal Council awarded medals to police officers of all ranks who served during the Shanghai war crisis of the previous year. The French Concession has recently decided to award medals as well, but only to members of the Volunteer Corps and special detectives. The regulations for awarding medals have been published in the Municipal Council Gazette. Once approved by the French Consul General in Shanghai, the commanders of the Volunteer Corps and special detectives will determine the recipients. At least a certain period of service is required to qualify for the medal. The team to which the recipient belongs will be distinguished by the color of the ribbon.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Elect Directors – Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting to be Held on April 19th

The Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting on the 11th of this month and proposed to elect directors on April 12th and 13th of this year.

### After Approval for Loading Cargo, the "De Ping" Steamer Will Sail to Wenzhou and then Ningbo Today

The Sino-Italian Shipping Company's "En De" and "De Ping" steamers have recently been approved by the Tenth Army Group to sail to Ningbo. After loading cotton, the "En De" steamer sailed to Wenzhou and then Ningbo on the afternoon of the 13th. The "De Ping" steamer also returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou on the 14th and was originally scheduled to join the voyage to Ningbo yesterday. However, due to insufficient cargo loading, it has been changed to sailing to Wenzhou and then Ningbo this afternoon. After loading cotton in Ningbo, it will return directly to Shanghai. All freight rates will be reduced by half, following the example of the "En De" steamer. As for Jardine Matheson & Co.'s "Mou Qian" steamer, after sailing to Ningbo on the morning of the 13th, the company received a telegram stating that it has been scheduled to return directly to Shanghai today and will dock tomorrow morning, continuing to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route.

### Chinese Troops Frequently Intercept Along the Port – Japanese Ship Cargo Transportation is Bleak – Inland Waterways Steamers Also Fall into Decline

The Nissin Steamship Company received orders from the Japanese military to implement transportation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and transferred steamers to operate in the ports of Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, and other ports, totaling fifty or sixty ships. At first, cargo transportation was quite developed, but in the last year or two, due to the extraordinary activity of the guerrilla forces in various ports, Japanese ships were frequently intercepted, resulting in the loss of silver. Most merchants did not dare to load their goods, and the passengers were often subjected to abuse and violence by the Japanese military escorts. Therefore, the business of the company's steamers has plummeted. Furthermore, the Jiangxin Steamer Company, which also belongs to the Nissin Steamship Company, operates the riverboat cargo transportation between Suzhou Creek and Huangpu, which has also become very sluggish.

### Cigarette Transportation to Yunnan – Collection of Special Transit Tax – Implemented from January 1st of this Year

Implemented from January 1st of this year, in order to develop Southwest trade, a large number of cigarettes manufactured in Shanghai are transported from Haiphong to Kunming and then sold inland. It is reported that the Yunnan Provincial Education Funding Administration has drafted six measures for collecting special transit taxes on cigarettes and submitted them to the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education for approval. In addition, they have also drafted twenty-five articles for provisional measures for collecting special transit taxes, stipulating that a special tax of seven-tenths of the local sales tax rate will be levied on all cigarettes passing through the border, starting from January 1st of this year. Level B tax offices will be established in the counties of Luyuan and Pingyi to handle tax collection affairs.

### Chinese Delegation Returns to Shanghai After Attending the World Christian Conference in India – Indian People are Very Sympathetic to China's Situation

According to the Dalu Bao, the fifteen members of the Chinese delegation who participated in the World Christian Conference in Madras, India, returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) aboard the Italian postal steamer Victoria. According to a representative, the number of members in the Chinese delegation was second only to India, which gave other delegations a good impression. They were well-received everywhere. The conference passed a resolution to assist church relief efforts in China and to help refugees. The activities of the twelve-member Japanese delegation attending the conference were minimal. In general, we found that the Indian people are very sympathetic to China's current situation. Among the Indian people themselves, the enthusiastic spirit of nationalism is increasing rapidly, and dissatisfaction with the Indian Congress Party is also increasing. Gandhi is a powerful figure in India, and most of his power lies in the fact that no one dares to oppose him. However, many younger factions are turning to Nehru as their leader. Nehru is a descendant of the aristocracy but expresses strong socialist tendencies. Some people in India call Gandhi the greatest friend of the British Empire. According to this representative who returned to Shanghai, there were three foreigners in the delegation, and the rest were Chinese.

### All Circles in This City Will Publicly Celebrate Yuan's Birthday Tomorrow – Admission by Commemorative Badge

Tomorrow is the sixty-sixth birthday of Chinese Director Yuan Ludeng. The people in the Concession hold Mr. Yuan in high esteem. A public celebration will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Yu Qiaqing Road at 6:00 PM tomorrow. Participation in the celebration is extremely enthusiastic. All participants are requested to collect commemorative badges from the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession at No. 304, 3rd Floor, No. 59 Hong Kong Road, in order to gain admission with the badge.

### Satisfactory Results of Second Phase of Refugee Donations from the Hotel Industry

The second phase (i.e., December) of the refugee donations collected by the hotel industry has come to a conclusion. A total of 189 hotels collected donations at a rate of 100 people per hotel, raising a total of 23,708.44 yuan in national currency. In addition, 86 small hotels each donated 2 yuan per month, raising a total of 176 yuan in national currency (two hotels collected donations for both November and December), totaling 23,884.44 yuan in national currency. Mr. Xu Wenzhao, a leader in the industry, has always been known for his enthusiasm for public welfare. He organized a fundraising committee to specialize in fundraising affairs. If any members of the industry did not collect donations in accordance with the regulations or did not collect them effectively, Mr. Xu would personally accompany the fundraising committee members and do their best to persuade them. Therefore, the results of the second phase were better than those of the first phase. In addition, there were rumors that some hotels were adding a surcharge of 10% to the bill for refugees. After investigation, it was found that the room rates for the hotel in question were fixed and could not be lowered. There was no surcharge added to the bill. In order to help the refugees, the industry has written to the Refugee Relief Association to clarify the matter and stated that this was not the case.

### Part of the British Garrison in Shanghai Will Return to the Country on Schedule

According to the North-China Daily News, a number of British soldiers selected from the Scottish Fusiliers, the Army Service Corps, and other British Army units stationed in Shanghai will leave Shanghai on the 18th and then board the British troop transport ship Dilwara to return home. The British Military Hospital and the various British Army barracks are scheduled to hold a farewell party on the evening of the 16th of this month. Several of the selected soldiers are well-known athletes.

### Commercial Registration Numbers of Businesses in This City – Economic Gazette Published – Also Published in the Commercial Monthly

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued the "Provisional Measures for Commercial Registration in Shanghai" promulgated by the Ministry of Economy. Article 6 states that "After the Shanghai Municipal Government restores its authority, the registration books will be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department for official publication and announcement." Similar to the previous temporary registration, it should not be announced. According to Article 13 of the Commercial Registration Law, it shall not be used to resist bona fide third parties, which is not in line with the purpose of protecting the interests of merchants. After deliberation, the Chamber decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Economy to request remedial measures. On the 14th of this month, the Ministry of Economy replied by telegram in December stating that it had received the two telegrams and that the temporary commercial registration in Shanghai had been approved by the Ministry and would be published in the Ministry of Economy Gazette and had been submitted to the Executive Yuan for the record. The Chamber informed the various industries and, because the Ministry of Economy Gazette was published in Chongqing and delivery by mail was slow, the Chamber published the registration numbers published in the Gazette in its monthly journal, the Commercial Monthly, to make it public.

### Large Quantities of Taiwanese Sugar Smuggled into Shanghai by the Japanese

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to information from our side, there is evidence that a large amount of Taiwanese sugar has been smuggled into Shanghai without paying customs duties. Reporters asked a Japanese spokesman yesterday why there was no record of this in the Customs report if a large amount of Taiwanese sugar was being imported into Shanghai. The spokesman said that the Taiwanese sugar was imported in December, not November. The December statistics have been released by the Customs, but there is no record of Taiwanese sugar imports in them either. The spokesman then said that he could provide a reply on this matter tomorrow.

### Mr. Fan Liangbo's Birthday Celebration

Yesterday was the 41st birthday of the famous Shanghai figure Mr. Fan Liangbo. Considering the chaos of the times, Fan did not want to be extravagant. His students eagerly organized a celebration for their teacher. They rented the Lianhua Nunnery on Qingbeidi Road and arranged a vegetarian feast for the guests. Gifts from relatives and friends were declined. Only contributions from students were accepted. After deducting the expenses for the celebration, the remaining funds were donated to refugee relief organizations to aid the disaster victims. This thoughtful gesture is commendable. Over a thousand guests attended, including Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng. During the banquet, Qingchang performances were provided as entertainment. Mr. Yuan Ludeng opened the performances, followed by famous performers such as Jin Sufei, Yu Sulian, Chen Hefeng, Wang Yaoqin, Zhang Wenqin, Han Sulan, and renowned amateur opera singers such as Zhao Peixin. Everyone enjoyed themselves, and the event was a rare spectacle.

### Spring and Autumn - Failing! Failing!

— Lu Jin

Having boasted about "occupying Shanghai in three days and taking Nanjing in ten," the expeditionary force, after a year and a half, is naturally stretched thin. However, the Chinese army is fighting stronger and stronger, and their political views are unified. Even attempts to encourage a puppet to open the door to peace only expose their own fear and baseness—this is called being caught between a rock and a hard place.

While holding onto such a vast area without being able to advance, and with finances completely exhausted, the only options are to open brothels, sell opium, and have the soldiers engage in labor to extract some money. This so-called "prosperity" "policy" is also the last resort. But amidst scorched earth and rubble, there is no way to "prosper" or extract wealth. Attempts by "clowns" to beckon the Chinese people with "Come, come" are unfortunately met by guerrilla forces, and the resident population suddenly becomes "undesirable elements." The wishful thinking of "numbing the people's minds" and "requisitioning on the spot" is like shooting oneself in the foot—this is called "laughable and absurd."

Now, things have gone a step further. Not only are finances exhausted, but even the army is becoming insufficient. However, there are still many methods being considered: organizing an "Anti-Communist Youth League" and "forcibly conscripting 1.35 million people." This is indeed another ruthless policy of "using Chinese against Chinese." However, whether Chinese youth in guerrilla areas can be easily dispatched, and whether they themselves fear "whether they can trust these armed Chinese," remains questionable—this is called "between a rock and a hard place."

In short, Konoe cannot "protect" the country, and Hiranuma Kiichirō probably cannot "pacify" this great disaster. Even if they loudly proclaim a "long-term war," they will be like someone who has drunk sleeping potion wine, and they will soon see "Failing, failing!"

### The Shame of Humanity

— Lu Li

The severe winter has arrived. Walking on the street, the cold wind blowing in my face feels like sharp knives cutting my face, ears, and nose… causing stabbing pain. Many homeless refugees are huddled on the sidewalks or in alleys, covering themselves with only a tattered mat. Some don't even have that, shivering in the biting north wind. Whenever I see such scenes, I am always deeply moved and breathless. They are enduring immense suffering for the survival and independence of their country! I shed a few tears. Sadly, my strength is too weak, limited to mere "sympathy."

However, what is heartbreaking is that there are still people sucking the blood of the sufferers, using murderous knives on the suffering, which truly shocks me and makes me lament that "the difference between humans and animals is so small!"

"Shen Zhiguang, the director of the No. 42 Refugee Shelter in Fahua Town, West Shanghai, was originally a refugee in the shelter. Because of recommendations from influential people, he was appointed to this position. Recently, he embezzled the refugees' food and sold it privately for personal gain. Because refugee Zhang Boyuan from Shishan leaked the secret and reported it to higher authorities, Shen had Zhang tortured with private beatings, leaving him covered in wounds. He then threatened to accuse Zhang of defamation and send him to the puppet organization 'Great Way Municipal Government' to face even harsher punishment. Zhang, fearing this, escaped by climbing over the wall but collapsed and died on the way due to the severity of his injuries…"

What a bloody example! Having experienced suffering oneself, one naturally deeply understands the pain. One should strive to improve the lives of the refugees and reduce their suffering. Anyone with a bit of "humanity" would do so. But Shen and others not only remained unmoved but also imposed pressure, threats, slander, and harm, fully exposing their bestiality. Their poisonousness is even worse than snakes and scorpions, hateful and worthy of death! Reading this news, my heart and mind are burned by the flames of anger. Anger makes me mad. I shout loudly, is this the world of humans? Human behavior? I know that the world is full of these demons and monsters with human faces but beastly hearts…

I am not sad, nor do I sigh. I will relentlessly curse, relentlessly scold, and I will even more relentlessly attack, exposing their true faces.

This is the shame of humanity!

New World Amusement Park Drum Ballad

Newly Compiled Shanghai New World Amusement Park Narrative Ballad

In Shanghai, timely drum ballads often appear, such as "Xuantong's Second Enthronement" and "Russo-Japanese War Drum Ballad." Whenever a special event occurs, a new drum ballad is sure to emerge. The "New World Amusement Park Drum Ballad" is one such example, with the amusement park life as its subject of song.

This book was created when amusement parks were just starting. "New World" was particularly grand in scale at the time, unlike its current state of decline. The reason why the author sang about "New World" and not "Great World" seems to be mainly this. Regardless of whether it is "New World," "Great World," or other "worlds," we can see the grand scene of the early rise of amusement parks in Shanghai from these thin four volumes, and what we hear is already quite sufficient. This is also the motivation for my discussing this drum ballad.

The book has illustrations in the front, including "Drum Ballad Storytelling," "Cross Talk," "Foreigners Dancing," "Famous Courtesans Giving Up Singing," "Western Magic," "Circus," "Stone Beam Waterfall," "Zishan Hall," "Charlie Chaplin," and "Swinging." The full title of the book is "Newly Compiled Shanghai New World Amusement Park Narrative Ballad," divided into four volumes, with four chapters each. The chapter titles are as follows:

Chapter 1 Opening the Trend of Establishing Amusement Parks Visiting Shanghai to Investigate New World

Chapter 2 Xu Zhenhua Visits Friend in Hardoon Garden Guan Yaxing Accompanies on Tour of New World

Chapter 3 Commenting on Courtesans and Affectionate Scholars Swinging with Girls Who are Competitive

Chapter 4 Nine Women Bathe Nude in the Milky Way Five People Enjoying a Visit to the Museum

Chapter 5 Walking Through Tunnels to Seek Western Food Enjoying the Artificial Mountain and Appreciating the Waterfall

Chapter 6 Watching the Waterfall Humorous Mockery of Drunkards Listening to Female Opera and Discussing Actors

Chapter 7 Second Play Writing Shadow Play Opening Setting off Fireworks Closing Amusement Activities

Chapter 8 Same Inn Hearing Comments on New World Watching Circus and Occasionally Forming Happy Relationships

Chapter 9 Presenting Martial Arts Brave Warriors Thrust Knives Competing in Skills Beautiful Women Racing Horses

Chapter 10 A Big Meal Good Friends Mocking the Free Hall Where the Rich are Humiliated

Chapter 11 Ugly Men Fooled at the Dance Party Rooftop Theater Westerners Showing Their Skills

Chapter 12 Performing Shadow Plays Watching Detective Stories in Detail Tourists Overwhelmed by Sensual Lyrics

Chapter 13 Second Floor Watching Fireworks Five Friends Entering the Amusement Park Three Times

Chapter 14 Zhu Maichen Cutting Wood Still Studies Hard Wu's Daughter Desperately Wants a Divorce Letter

Chapter 15 Zhu Maichen Passes the Examination and Returns in Glory Wu's Daughter Splashes Water at the Long Pavilion

Chapter 16 Watching the Waterfall Revealing the Underbelly for No Reason Theater Viewing Brocade Ze Map

The whole book uses a tourist as a thread to sing about various amusements in the "New World" and their performance process, which is very detailed. The performers at the time are also described in detail. Each chapter has a poem for the opening, with sayings and singing sentences similar. In terms of writing technique, it is difficult to show its excellence. Published by Jiangdong Maoji Bookstore, stone-printed medium-sized edition, divided into four volumes, and it is not easy to obtain now. However, even in amusement parks, there have been many changes in the past twenty years.

### Shanghai People's Food

— Xin Liang

To begin with, we can say that the people of Shanghai are blessed with good food. As long as you have "money," you can immediately bring whatever you want to eat to your table, whether it's Nanjing salted duck, Beijing candied dates, Sichuan white fungus, or even American oranges and French champagne. Is there anything that cannot be done in Shanghai?

Since the outbreak of the war, eateries from all over the countryside have been forced to relocate or have been destroyed by bombs. As a result, under the limits of manpower and resources, countless numbers have moved to continue operating in the Shanghai concessions. Today, just by looking up, you can easily see a Shanghai branch of Suzhou Caizhiqi here, and a "Kunshan Duck Noodle" snack bar there.

A person living in Shanghai can eat various things non-stop from dawn to midnight every day.

In the morning, Shanghai people rarely eat porridge at home. Wealthy people can, of course, go to a warm teahouse to eat some so-called "breakfast" items. Just ask Da Dong, Da Sanyuan, Guanshengyuan, and other famous teahouses; are they not all "packed with guests" every morning? Barbecue pork buns, chicken buns, e-fu noodles, and milk, toast, coffee… the variety is truly countless, causing anyone who sees them to drool. Secondly, we can see countless heads moving in the pastry shops of Wufangzhai and Wufuzhai. Eating some eel noodles, small meat noodles, soup dumplings, etc. in the morning is indeed very delicious. As for working friends, because they don't have time to cook porridge at home, they also spend a few cents briskly to fill their stomachs every morning. Anyway, there are many stalls selling sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, sticky rice balls, fried tofu vermicelli, soy milk, and tofu pudding on the streets. As soon as they step out the door, it is not difficult for them to quickly finish a "breakfast" and go to work.

At noon, 12 o'clock, everyone must go through the daily "second meal." Naturally, like the "first meal" in the morning, many people go into "magnificent" restaurants to eat a "exquisite" dish costing several yuan, or order something like "shark fin." People in the general office worker class happily gather in groups of three or four to eat an affordable meal in a "restaurant alley," where the price is not high, and the food is not bad. Thirdly, they go to a small restaurant and order a "salted pork tofu soup" or "salted vegetable shredded pork" to eat. Each meal costs no more than 2 mao per person, and the enjoyment they get is not much lower than that of friends who go to big restaurants.

"Three meals a day." Around 6 o'clock in the afternoon is the time for us to have our "third meal." From one point of view, this meal seems to be much lighter than the other two meals. Many families prefer to buy some "deep-fried soybeans," "deep-fried fruit," "pickled radishes," and other things to eat with "tea-soaked rice" at night. Similarly, many people like to eat porridge at night. However, on the other hand, when holding banquets and grand feasts, the evening is still considered the "main event."

Shanghai people can eat "snacks," "tea pastries," etc. from time to time in addition to the three meals. What about "wonton," "dumplings," "pot stickers," "pan-fried buns," "spare rib noodles"? As long as your stomach can handle it, you don't have to worry about not wanting to eat them.

Even in the dead of night, under the hazy moonlight, you will surely still hear someone shouting in the alleys, "Fried rice noodles," "Ham zongzi," "White sugar lotus seed porridge," and "Osmanthus red bean soup." And even more people are broadcasting advertisements for "red bean soup noodles" and "fermented rice balls" on the radio.

Finally, we can say that the people of Shanghai are blessed with good food!

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization Guide Jin Talks About Equality

Miss He Liyu said: "Newly built roads are called 'roads.' Old roads, originally named something 'street' or something 'lane,' should still keep their original names. We Chinese have many street and lane names that are extremely elegant, and we don't seem to need to change them." Miss Jin said: "Whether Chinese or foreigners, everyone has a habit: every time there is a reform, they always use the names of a few famous or important people as the names of streets. Although this also expresses the intention to worship heroes, doing it once in a while is fine, but if everything is named like that, it becomes annoying. If we are talking about worshiping heroes, then the world is constantly progressing. Even if we say there are no predecessors, we cannot say there are no successors. After one hero, there will be another hero, so the road name will have to be changed from time to time. According to me, as Liyu-jie said, the former streets and lanes had very elegant names, so it would be better to keep the old names, which is a one-size-fits-all solution." He Liyu said: "Using famous people's surnames as place names and object names is also most common in foreign countries, and Chinese people later followed suit. I heard my great-grandfather say: the first British ship that came to Guangzhou was named 'Confucius.' They thought that we Chinese most respected Confucius, so they named the ship that came to China after the person most respected by the Chinese. Later, as China gradually became westernized, the naming of places after people became even more common." Miss Jin said: "Some places call it 'road' and some places call it 'dao.' We must unify them in terms of names. Right." At this time, Miss Jin's fiancé, Mr. Lin, was busy driving. Hearing this, he turned around and smiled: "Your recent thoughts are all about wanting to unify everything. I think some things certainly need to be unified, but it's okay if some things are not unified." Miss Jin quickly asked: "Why is it better if some things are not unified?" Mr. Lin said: "For example, look at the houses by the roadside. Now, the newly built ones have all kinds of styles, some ancient, some modern, some French, and some German. If everything is unified according to your wishes, then all the houses will be in one style. Where's the interest? Recently, industrialists have been promoting standardization, which I don't really agree with, but it can't be helped in the early days of Chinese industry." It turns out that this Mr. Lin is a construction engineer who studied in France. Many large buildings in China are designed and patterned by him. Although he is only twenty-eight years old, his technology is excellent, and his appearance is handsome. Who doesn't know this young engineer, Mr. Lin Jiancheng? (15)

### Vernacular Opening Remarks

— Yi Ge

Before beginning a full performance, storytellers in performance halls and on the radio always perform an opening piece. Most of the sentences in the opening piece are ancient poetic lines, and even if the audience has the original text to compare, they will inevitably only have a partial understanding; if there is no original text, and it is sung in the Yu tone, it is simply unintelligible.

Although the opening piece is subordinate to the main performance, it has considerable value in social education. If it can be adapted into vernacular, discarding feudal ideas, and using novel and meaningful themes, singing it like Bai Juyi's poems, which even old women can understand, its effectiveness is undoubtedly above the main performance. Because the opening piece is shorter and can be sung in a few minutes, while the main performance must be performed for at least three or four segments before it can temporarily end. The opening piece is like a cartoon in a movie, or a prelude to a drama. Although it cannot completely satisfy fans, it is definitely not a mere ornament.

Vernacular opening pieces have been written before, incorporating slang and local dialects, which is a rationalization in form, but the content still needs to be improved. I advocate that it should be popular without being vulgar, and each piece should have a clear concept. It must not be like singing a solo performance, with crude words and phrases, merely to elicit a laugh from the audience.

Currently, there are very few vernacular opening pieces, and classical opening pieces are still regarded as rare commodities by storytellers. Some people on radio programs specialize in singing opening pieces, like pouring water from a bottle, singing very quickly, tasting like wax, making them even more meaningless. I hope that people who like to create opening pieces will accept my contribution and create new vernacular opening pieces to supply storytellers to perform.

### Women's Professional Theater Troupe's Debut Performance: Impressions of Women's Apartment

— Bing Du

In order to attend another social gathering, I did not see the entire play. But in terms of the second half, although it did not have better achievements, it was not so unsuccessful. It should be said that in the depiction of the characters' personalities, Qi Weide, Zhao Guanying, and Niu Dawang all had excellent performances. However, there are a few whose pronunciation or lines were not well prepared. Zhao's mother and others were also quite faithful and very hardworking.

For an amateur performer who has just stepped onto the stage, our hope for it is a bright future. Although "Women's Apartment" cannot surpass "Qingdao," what is valuable is their enthusiasm for theater is very young, and this spirit of bold experimentation is also worthy of respect.

However, it must also be said that in addition to praising and encouraging the "Women's Professional Theater Troupe" itself in principle, we should also actively help it grow and progress. For example, in terms of acting skills, there are inevitably still many awkward and loose areas. However, these shortcomings are the inevitable phenomena when every performer first steps onto the stage. We believe that they will gradually disappear.

The lighting is good, and costumes, props, sound, and makeup do not occupy a large part. The most obvious thing is that the director wants to focus entirely on the performance of the play, but as a result, the development of the play has not reached the expected tightness, and the atmosphere of the whole play feels very sparse. Scenes like the meeting of parents and children and Zhao Zi's departure were not emphasized, but the section where Guanying cries is very wonderful. However, on the whole, for a "Women's Professional Theater Troupe" that has just stepped onto the stage, it is very gratifying to have such achievements. Moreover, Hong Mo's Qi Weide and Zhang Rengzhu's Zhao Guanying are very natural and lifelike. Starting from "Women's Apartment," we hope that the "Women's Professional Theater Troupe" can meet us again with a more advanced posture.

### Silver Train

Zhou Xuan, on the day "Meng Jiangnu" was completed, specially purchased a Columbia latest radio from Baidai Company, worth several hundred gold, to commemorate the success of this unprecedented starring role. It is said that among female stars' radios, Zhou Xuan's is the most beautiful and well-equipped.

The eiderdown fan held by Yuan Meiyun in her recent work "Young Mistress's Fan" is a small prop from Wu Cun's maiden work "Wind" at Lianhua Second Factory, which caused a sensation at the time. It is also the most noble of the small props in Chinese cinema. Factory director Lu Jie has kept this fan very carefully. It has been cherished extremely well, and it has only recently been seen on the screen again after Zhang Shankun repeatedly borrowed it.

Xu Xinfu and Han Langan held a self-provided car race on Xujiahui Road. When the cars arrived at the Albé Road studio, one of Mr. Xu's car wheels flew off, and Mr. Han's military truck sounded like a coppersmith's load. It can be said that there are no two coincidences that are exactly the same.

Sun Min has been recommended by "Wu Zetian" to Xinhua and will play the leading role in the new films of directors Wan Cang, Xu Xinfu, and Wu Yonggang.

Lu Ming is now acting in "Studio Story" for Yihua. She is also acting in "Red Dust Drifting" for Guohua, making her the busiest actress in recent times for filming contract films.

The theme song of Chen Yunshang's "Hua Mulan" was written by Yan Gongshang and has the same artistic merit as the "Great Sudden Tune" of "Diao Chan."

### The Spoken Drama Movement in Northern Jiangsu

— Feng Hua

The cultural level of Northern Jiangsu was not originally very high, but since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the gathering of various talents, the cultural level has increased considerably. For example, in spoken drama, Northern Jiangsu was still an uncultivated virgin land in the past, but now, with the development of the Anti-Japanese War movement, the spoken drama movement has become very vigorous and very common. Famous writers such as Hong Weifa, Pao Yu, and Zhou Xing are now in the new provincial capital (Huaiyin). Since jointly initiating the organization of the Jiangsu Literary Association and the Anti-Japanese War Drama Troupe, they have been performing many shows every day. Following this, many branches have emerged in places like Xinghua, Taizhou, Gao郵, and Bao應. At the same time, Bao Yu has compiled many scripts for local drama troupes to perform. The most famous is the one-act play "Rebirth," which takes the theme of how the Heavenly King Temple Broadsword Society participated in the Anti-Japanese War against Japan. The plot is very moving. He has now created a new four-act play, "No Personal Feuds," published in the "Literary Ten-Day Journal" published by the Literary Association. It writes about a woman who wants to harm a guerrilla leader for revenge but is instead moved and joins the battle herself. The plot is very tortuous. It will be performed by the Anti-Japanese War Drama Troupe at the "People's Theater" in the provincial capital. It is also reported that a spoken drama training class is planned to be established in the shortest possible time to create spoken drama cadres to go deep into the occupied areas to work. If it can be realized, young people who love spoken drama will enthusiastically participate.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City in the Old Capital (7) (7)

The Strange Actor Wang Fushou Invariably Gets Booed Every Time He Performs

When Meng Xiaodong, as his "Cinnabar Mole," came on stage, he went to Wu Da Xiang Gong. Unexpectedly, his singing and dialogue were more than twice that of the main character, Han Yuanwai, making it impossible for Xiaodong, who was playing Qingyi, to keep up. The audience listening to the play had never heard of Wu Da Xiang Gong singing like that, and they suspected he was fabricating it. In addition, the children of the Gao family were young and vigorous and wanted to retaliate for the taunt he had said earlier. So, a full house of boos was given, no matter how great your ability to stare with red, green, or five eyes, you were booed off. That day, Qixian (Wang Fushou) really put in a lot of effort, singing and reciting the lines from the play with Gui Fen in the inner court word for word. He never expected that outside, when singing "Cinnabar Mole," the emphasis was only on Han Yuanwai and Wu Da Niangzi, and the role of Wu Da Xiang Gong was entirely filled by a perfunctory old man. He was a sincere person, with no sense of occasion, and didn't know how to adapt to the times, which led to this embarrassing situation. The reason was that his singing was too sophisticated for the general public, but if he hadn't caused trouble with his bad mouth, he wouldn't have been opposed by both the front and back stages. He only sang for one day with the Gao family's troupe and was dismissed. On another occasion, someone introduced him to a certain troupe. When he entered the backstage and looked at the names on the wooden plaque on the wall, he immediately grabbed a spear, used the spearhead to destroy all the names, broke the spear into several pieces, and exclaimed: "There is simply no one in this group who can sing!" After saying that, he turned around and left, making the introducer go crazy with anger.

Above, it was said that he had committed a great act of disrespect in front of the Empress Dowager in the palace. Why was he only punished by kneeling? And afterwards, Wei Bubao not only did not argue with him but instead kowtowed to him and softly pleaded with him. Could it be that Red Eyes Four (Wang Fushou) really had some unique skills? But then again, he really had some tricks up his sleeve. When it came to martial arts, he could sing "The Four Heroes Village" and somersault more than two people high. He was even more skilled than Gao Xueqiao, a famous martial arts actor who was known for being able to somersault over a cloth city and therefore looked down on everyone else. When it came to long-bearded plays, he knew all the ones that the old Yu could perform. One day, the palace scheduled "Tianshui Pass" starring Da Tou (Wang Guichen), but Wang Guichen had to take leave due to an emergency. Wang Si (Wang Fushou) played Kongming on stage and was able to satisfy the Empress Dowager. Da Tou used high-pitched singing in some places, and he could also sing it the same way.

### "Meng Jiangnü" Filming Completed

The well-known story of "Meng Jiangnü" has now been made into a movie by Guohua Film Company. The entire film is antique in style, and the scenery is grand, such as the Great Wall and the Qin Dynasty palaces, all of which spared no expense in pursuing common truth, beauty, and goodness. The film was written and directed by Wu Cun, and the old drama has been refined in a new way, making the meaning clearer, and the director's delicacy is even more special. Ms. Zhou Xuan plays Meng Jiangnü, and her image is suitable. The two songs she sings, "Hundred Flowers Song" and "Spring Flowers Like Brocade," are pleasing to the ear. The male lead is played by Xu Feng. This gentleman was the first-place student admitted to the Mingxing Performing Arts Training Institute. The film was produced by Mingxing Film Company, and the entire film is accompanied by national music and will be released at the Jincheng Grand Theater soon.

### Chess Garden Seventh Game Endgame Summary Red to Move and Win

— Edited by Bao Zibo, Revised by Lu Chengzhai

Endgames are roughly divided into two types. The chess formations published in the manuals are generally fabricated and cannot be derived from a full game. The "Endgame Summary" published in this garden is commonly seen in games and is necessary for practical use. It can be regarded as essential knowledge. For example, everyone knows that this game is a win for Red, but they don't know why it's a win because they don't understand the moves. In the past, the famous player Wan Qiyou played against Lei Haishan at the Simeixuan Chess Club. Mr. Wan held a chariot and pawn, while Mr. Lei held a chariot, soldier, and complete advisors and elephants. At that time, they went back and forth for three hours, and Mr. Lei ultimately had no way to win. Mr. Wan was able to achieve a lucky draw, which shows that this game is not easy.
