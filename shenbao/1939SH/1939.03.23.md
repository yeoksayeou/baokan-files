Editorial

### Establish a Far Eastern Anti-Aggression Front!

Since the disintegration of Czechoslovakia, Europe has once again presented an extremely tense situation. Now, democratic nations such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are proceeding to establish a democratic front, attempting to use collective power to prevent the occurrence of new acts of aggression. The fascist nations of Europe have always been accustomed to using intimidation as a weapon for extortion. If the democratic nations of Europe are truly prepared to eliminate war with war, then they may be able to maintain a period of relative stability in the future.

However, world peace is a whole, and security is collective. Merely seeking peace and security in Europe is insufficient to speak of true peace and lasting security. Moreover, even to achieve peace and security in a corner of Europe, it is necessary to ensure that the entire world can be peaceful and secure. In today's world, the international economic interests are too complex and too subtle to be confined to the interests of a narrow range. The Soviet Union understands this, so when the European democratic front was decided, it stated that the new collective security system should not be limited to a corner of Europe. This illustrates the idea that European peace and security depend on world peace and security. Even countries not bordering the European continent, such as the United States, deeply understand this, so it has repeatedly made righteous statements condemning the aggressor nations and is willing to strengthen the institutions that guarantee world peace. In the past, fascist nations in Europe and Asia dared to carry out acts of aggression against democratic nations because they were holding the fact that democratic nations around the world could not effectively cooperate, so they were able to use the strategy of mutual restraint, colluding with each other and causing general democratic nations to be wary for their own interests, ultimately being threatened by fascist aggression. Now, in order to eliminate this threat, the democratic nations of Europe should establish a European democratic front, while also urgently uniting with other democratic nations with relations in the Far East to establish a Far Eastern anti-aggression front, crushing the strategy of mutual collusion between the fascist nations of Europe and Asia. This is the fundamental way to maintain peace and security in Europe and the entire world.

The fascist aggression in Europe and Asia is almost the same in method, style, and purpose. European fascists use the so-called reasonable demands of the Greater Germanic nation and the freedom and independence of ethnic minorities as an excuse for their aggression. The aggressors in the Far East have played this trick on China before, and are now using this usual trick in the Nanyang region. The European fascists' method of aggression is first economic, then political, and finally military. The aggressors in the Far East are also the same. Regarding China, they first proposed so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and later suggested so-called "joint anti-communism," and finally implemented military aggression. Regarding the exclusion of the rights and interests of European and American countries in the Far East, they first economically suppressed foreigners, and then claimed that the existence of foreign concessions in China was illegal. As for the use of force against Europe and the United States, although it has not yet been formally implemented, it is at least ready. Japan's construction of a permanent military base on Hainan Island is a military action prepared against Britain and France. The targets of the European fascists' aggression are not only Spain and Czechoslovakia. Similarly, Japan's aggressive purpose is not limited to China alone. Many observers with a broad vision know that the colonies of Britain, France, and other European and American countries in the Far East are also within Japan's scope of aggression. In light of the recent tension in the European situation, who can guarantee that Japan will not use this opportunity to expand its acts of aggression? If the European countries are unwilling to give up their rights and interests in the Far East, they should take advantage of the opportunity for cooperation in Europe and adopt a consistent anti-aggression approach in the Far East.

In this war of China's resistance against Japanese fascist aggression, the democratic nations with close relations to the Far East, such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, although have had different degrees of urgency in the past, it is now necessary for everyone to take consistent action. This is not only a direct issue of sympathy and assistance to China, but is actually an indirect turning point in separately attacking the fascist aggressions of Europe and Asia. China stands on the front line of the world's support for democracy, hoping to closely cooperate with all democratic nations through its own heroic efforts to deal a blow to the aggressors. We expect that Britain can use its spirit of cooperation in Europe to unite with the Soviet Union and other related countries in the Pacific to establish a Far Eastern anti-aggression front as a strong pillar of world peace!

### President of the British Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin Kidnapped - Ransom of 2 Million Yuan Demanded

The reason is criticism of Japanese puppet regime's destruction of legal tender

Implemented by bandit leader Wu Changling under Japanese orders

(Tianjin) Since the president of the British Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin, Mr. T.E.Tudor, was kidnapped from his residence in the First Special District on March 17 by three Chinese men, his whereabouts have remained unknown. This morning, Wilson & Co., where Mr. Tudor serves as general manager, suddenly received an anonymous letter demanding 2 million yuan as ransom for Mr. Tudor's release. Since this kidnapping case occurred, British and other foreign nationals residing in the Japanese-occupied areas of Tianjin have moved to the British and French concessions, causing the hotels in the British and French concessions to be full. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News - The truth about the kidnapping of Mr. Tudor, President of the British Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin, has been fully clarified. It was indeed instigated by the Japanese. Although the British authorities have made repeated efforts, his whereabouts have not been found. In the past two days, the British Consul-General has contacted the Japanese side twice, but without any results. The true reason for this case is that when the Japanese puppet regime announced that the use of legal tender was prohibited, Tudor made a speech at the annual meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, criticizing this measure of the Japanese puppet regime from a business standpoint, which aroused considerable dissatisfaction among the Japanese. The Japanese Jianbu Unit stationed in Tianjin decided to deal with Tudor, and sent the bandit leader Wu Changling, whom they had recruited in Xianshuigu, to handle the matter. Wu led his henchmen to Tudor's residence in the First Special District to kidnap him. After kidnapping him, they traveled along the Tianjin Avenue when the car broke down. So, they hired another car to drive to Haixia. When they arrived at Baitangkou, they were detained by the local puppet police and militia. The local puppet police officer, believing that he had performed a meritorious service, immediately reported to the Japanese advisor in Tianjin. The Japanese advisor immediately notified all parties. The unit in question received the news and immediately sent troops by car to Baitangkou, along with the local Japanese army, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Huoxi, to intercept Tudor. At the same time, the Japanese learned that the British authorities knew about Tudor's presence in Baitangkou, so they immediately sent a team to intercept him. They also ordered the puppet police and militia not to publicize that a kidnapped Westerner had passed through there, so when the British sent someone to investigate, they were unable to find out the truth and rescue Tudor. As for the reason why the inside story was revealed, it was because this case was handled independently by the Honma Unit. The Japanese military police were unaware of the situation beforehand and thought it was an ordinary kidnapping case, so they also cooperated with the British in the investigation. Now that the inside story has been clarified, it is expected that since the Japanese have handled this matter, they will not release Tudor. In addition, the Japanese are now buying over ruffians and local bandits to kidnap British and American politicians and influential businessmen in Tianjin. The preparations are extremely thorough. The British and American authorities have ordered all expatriates residing in the First Special District to move to the concessions and have increased the number of troops to provide close protection within the boundaries.

### Bandit Troubles in Western Hunan Soon to Be Cleared

Legal Tender Circulates Unhindered

A dispatch from Yuanling reports that since the Hunan Provincial Government has actively developed the Western Hunan Special Zone, social construction has gradually been implemented. Eradication of banditry has been the most important task. Former Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, recognizing that Western Hunan had many special traditional forces and a large number of scattered firearms, ordered Chen Quzhen, Director of the Western Hunan Pacification Headquarters, to be responsible for the cleanup.

In addition to ordering his subordinate divisions to separately suppress sporadic bandit gangs, Chen reorganized the large number of mixed troops and established cadre training classes in a certain location to provide appropriate training. Most of the mixed troops' firearms have now been concentrated. After Chairman Xue took over Hunan's administration, he strictly enforced the order to pacify bandits, setting a deadline of the end of March to clear the bandit troubles in Western Hunan. In addition to Chen Quzhen dispatching troops to suppress bandit troubles in the areas along the Qianyang-Sichuan and Western Hunan highways, such as Qiancheng, Yongshui, Chenxi, and Zhijiang, the Wang Zhonglian division of the Xth Army Corps was also dispatched to be responsible for suppressing bandits in the Yuanling and Luxi areas. After the lunar New Year, several divisions of Wang's troops arrived in Western Hunan. Wang also personally visited Luxi once to direct operations, coordinating with Chen's forces to actively and thoroughly suppress bandits. Chen also personally went to Yongshui to hold a bandit suppression meeting.

All forces were mobilized to suppress bandits. Chen is now concurrently serving as a commissioner of the Hunan Provincial Government, and his pacification headquarters is still located in Qiancheng. He came to Yuanling to meet with Secretary-General Li Yangjing, and Wang also came to Yuanling to jointly discuss bandit suppression matters. According to statements issued by Chen and Wang, the bandit troubles in Western Hunan will definitely be cleared as scheduled. Now, travel by waterway and highway is no longer as difficult as it used to be. Refugees and grain service teams from various places are all traveling west on foot without obstruction. As for political measures, they are to promote central government policies, stimulate national consciousness, and raise cultural standards. Since Secretary-General Li Yangjing arrived in Yuanling and took office,

The Administration of Western Hunan

has become even more convenient. The Baojia system in each county has long been fully established, and recently, self-defense corps have been organized within the Baojia system, under the command and training of the district security commander. The Bao chiefs have also undergone rotational training. The Pacification Headquarters has also formed guidance and propaganda teams, and social organizations have youth service corps that go deep into the countryside to mobilize farmers. Central government policies can indeed be promoted without hindrance. Western Hunan has always circulated silver coins and Sichuan currency, but now legal tender is in circulation. The Pacification Headquarters issued a notice banning the use of the above-mentioned hard currencies within a specified time limit, so people from various provinces who come to Hunan with legal tender can circulate it without hindrance. Western Hunan's culture has always been considered backward, but recently, major daily newspapers have moved to Yuanling, and public opinion has shown vigorous signs. Anhui National Middle School, Jiangsu Provisional Middle School, and the Bank College have all moved to Western Hunan, with branches established in Qiancheng, Yongshui, and other places. Recently, the province ordered that the directors and section chiefs of the education bureaus of each county not be easily changed, in order to ensure the consistent implementation of the Western Hunan education network. At the same time, wartime teachers have set up temporary primary schools and compulsory night schools in various counties to promote mass education. Cultural standards are also gradually improving compared to the past. (March 4th)

### Haizhou Heavily Bombed

Most of the Houses in the City Were Destroyed

A dispatch from Xuzhou reports that Haizhou, a key point on the Longhai Railway, fell on March 5th. Before the Chinese army fought bravely in resistance, Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed the city. The bombing situation in the city was extremely tragic.

### Lithuania Oppressed by Violence, Memel Ceded to Germany

Lithuanian Troops Withdraw Entirely, Feeling Distressed

Hitler Scheduled to Arrive for Inspection Today

Memel At eight o'clock this morning, the Memel Autonomous Region received a declaration of annexation into Germany, which spread throughout the region. Churches rang bells to celebrate, ships docked in the harbor sounded their horns in agreement, and villages large and small hung the Nazi swastika flag. Residents of the region then gathered in public places at nine o'clock to hold a celebration. (March 23rd, Haitian Telegram)

(Berlin) Führer Hitler, bound for the Memel Autonomous Region, departed from here by train, first to Swinemünde, a port on the Baltic coast, where he will board a warship and then sail to Memel, with an estimated arrival time of nine o'clock tomorrow morning. (March 22nd, Havas)

(Berlin) To give Lithuanian soldiers and officers stationed in Memel ample time to withdraw, German troops will not enter Memel territory until tomorrow. (March 22nd, Haitian Telegram)

(Paris) The Memel Autonomous Region, which Lithuania returned to Germany today, has a total population of 140,000, including 63,000 Germans, 38,000 Lithuanians, and 39,000 Memel residents. After World War I, according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany ceded it to the management of the Entente Powers. Until February 16, 1923, the Entente Powers held a conference of ambassadors in Paris (attended by the ambassadors of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan to France), and decided to subordinate the region to Lithuanian territory, but with a special system. Later, the ambassadors of the respective countries, together with the Lithuanian Minister to France, signed an agreement on May 9, 1924, but the Japanese government did not ratify it. This agreement stipulated that although the Memel Autonomous Region was ceded to Lithuania, it enjoyed autonomy in legislative, administrative, financial, and judicial matters. The country could appoint a governor to preside over its administration, and its legislative power was exercised by the Regional Council, whose members were elected by universal suffrage. The executive power was exercised by the Administrative Committee, which had a chairman appointed by the governor. (March 22nd, Havas)

Memel The political power of Memel has been removed from the hands of Lithuania and is governed by the Memel Executive. According to the declaration announced this morning, the Lithuanian authorities have lost their control over Memel. All post offices, radio stations, and ports are under the management of the Memel Executive. Lithuanian soldiers stationed here will first gather in several locations and then withdraw. (March 22nd, Haitian Telegram)

(Paris) According to news from the Lithuanian capital, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbsys today and presented him with a German ultimatum, demanding that Lithuania cede Memel within two days. If Lithuania refuses, German troops gathered at the border will march into Lithuanian territory. If it accepts the ultimatum, Germany will guarantee Lithuania's borders and allow it the right to use the port of Memel. (March 21st, Reuters)

(Berlin) It is rumored that the German government has presented the Lithuanian government with an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal from the Memel Autonomous Region. Semi-official sources here have denied this, saying that such rumors are not accurate. (March 21st, Havas)

### Lithuanian Cabinet Members Fly to Berlin to Resolve Various Issues

(Berlin) Officials have announced that German troops will enter the city of the Memel Autonomous Region tonight. Well-informed sources have also stated that three Lithuanian cabinet members, led by former Foreign Minister Lozoraitis, are scheduled to fly here this afternoon to visit Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and pay respects to Führer Hitler. This trip is not only to resolve the formalities of handing over the Memel Autonomous Region, but also to discuss economic cooperation between Lithuania and Germany in the port of Memel. However, the main issue at present is whether Lithuania's territory will remain intact in the future, and Germany has not yet provided concrete guarantees. (March 22nd, Havas)

(Berlin) The German News Agency stated today that all administrative power in Memel has now been transferred to the Memel Executive Council, whose chairman is Mr. Petrulaitis, who is inclined to National Socialism. (March 22nd, Reuters)

### Lithuanian Foreign Minister Reports on Berlin Negotiations

Kaunas Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbsys attended a cabinet meeting last night and reported on his talks with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Berlin. He stated that Ribbentrop, on behalf of the German government, suggested that Lithuania voluntarily return Memel to Germany, and expressed that this action was a necessary measure to maintain peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries. Ribbentrop also stated that if Memel is voluntarily returned to Germany, Germany will give due consideration to Lithuania's economic interests in the port. It is said that Ribbentrop repeatedly mentioned the appeals of all Germans in Memel for the return of Memel to Germany during the talks, and that the current tense situation and unrest in the local area made it necessary to resolve the issue quickly. (March 22nd, Haitian Telegram)

Lithuanian Capital Officials announced that the cabinet held a meeting yesterday afternoon that lasted until 5 PM. Foreign Minister Urbsys immediately reported on his talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop regarding the return of the Memel Autonomous Region to Germany, stating that Ribbentrop insisted that this issue must be resolved quickly in accordance with Germany's demands to avoid friction. It is said that after the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Urbsys also reported on the situation at a secret meeting of the parliament. It is said that the various demands made by Germany have caused Lithuania to feel distressed. The Lithuanian government has indeed encountered a difficult situation, and it is difficult to say how it will decide at this time, because the government must adapt to its own needs on the one hand, and take reality into account on the other. (March 22nd, Havas)

### Slogan of National Self-Determination Used to Cover Up Aggression

Kovno The Lithuanian government announced today that Germany has agreed to consider Lithuania's economic interests in the port of Memel, provided that the transfer of Memel is voluntary. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop reportedly stated to Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbsys that news from Memel made it necessary to resolve this issue quickly in accordance with the German proposal to avoid conflict. The German document to the Lithuanian government cited the principle of national self-determination as the basis for Germany's demands, stating that the living conditions of Germans and non-Germans in Memel were impossible. It is said that Germany did not make any special economic demands on other parts of Lithuania. (March 22nd, Reuters)

### Lithuanian Garrison Fully Withdrawn, Nationwide Martial Law Declared

Memel Lithuanian infantry stationed in the Memel Autonomous Region began withdrawing yesterday afternoon and were transferred to other parts of Lithuania. It is said that all Lithuanian troops stationed in the Memel Region will be withdrawn by tomorrow, and the Memel garrison will be responsible for the region's defense. (March 26th, Haitian Telegram)

Lithuanian Capital The Lithuanian government has declared martial law throughout the country since noon today and has issued a notice advising the public to remain calm. At the same time, border police have been dispatched to protect public institutions in the Memel Region. Residents, mostly holding flowers, have been waiting for the German troops since early morning. No incidents have occurred in the region. Governor Gallius informed the Administrative Committee that German soldiers in the Lithuanian army would be sent back to Germany immediately. (March 22nd, Havas)

### Jews Fleeing in Panic, Germans Strutting About

Memel According to non-official sources here, the Lithuanian government has decided to accept Germany's demands and is preparing to hand over the land of Memel immediately. Jews and Lithuanians are now fleeing in panic, non-stop. (March 21st, Reuters)

(Berlin) The German General News Agency recently published a dispatch from a reporter in the Memel Autonomous Region, stating that large numbers of Jews in the region are now fleeing to live in Lithuanian territory. The station is filled with military equipment to be transported to Lithuania. German residents of the autonomous region are very excited and are hanging German flags in the windows. (March 22nd, Havas)

Memel Jewish residents in the Memel Autonomous Region began group relocation yesterday, moving to central Lithuania in droves. The train to the Lithuanian capital yesterday afternoon was extremely crowded, filled with Jewish refugees. At the same time, the Memel Autonomous Region authorities notified banks in the region to stop paying out large deposits. (March 22nd, Haitian Telegram)

### Germany Continues to Advance: A Bloodless War

Britain and Poland are Extremely Concerned

(London) British individuals who feel a special interest in international politics seem to be more strongly attracted to news about Memel and the Mediterranean than to news about President Lebrun's visit to Britain. Even today's newspapers provide detailed accounts of trivial matters concerning Memel, while descriptions of the reception of President Lebrun are rather brief. According to the foreign affairs correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," political figures find it difficult to determine whether Germany has unconditionally supported Italy's North African plan in Hitler's letter to the Italian ambassador to Germany, who has returned to Rome. (March 22nd, Hai Tong Cable)

(London) Today, the political correspondent of the "Daily Express" stated that Germany's annexation of Memel will not provoke drastic action from Britain. The British government believes that Germany's annexation of Memel is not a reason to take drastic action. When Britain drafted the "anti-aggression" declaration, Memel and Danzig were excluded because these two areas are predominantly German-speaking. (March 22nd, Associated Press)

(London) The British do not seem very surprised by the incorporation of Memel into Germany, but political figures are refraining from comment until they know the details of how the annexation was carried out. The "Daily Mail" stated that the annexation of Memel should not be a major problem. Lithuania seized Memel for itself in 1923, but the area has a long-standing relationship with Germany, and the residents are mostly Germanic. Hitler's annexation of Memel can be said not to contradict the principle of national self-determination. The London Times also stated that as long as Lithuania's sovereignty and integrity are not violated, the annexation of Memel into Germany will not have serious political repercussions. (March 22nd, Hai Tong Cable)

Warsaw  Local newspapers recently reported that German troops are scheduled to enter the Memel autonomous region today. Lithuanian border troops stationed along the border with Germany have already withdrawn. Polish circles are deeply shaken by this news. While government officials refuse to comment, newspapers have begun to discuss the possible consequences. The "Polonia" newspaper stated, "Germany, relying on the Rome-Berlin Axis, began by encompassing Austria, followed by the annexation of the Sudetenland, then the main part of Czechoslovakia, and now the annexation of the Memel region. From now on, it is almost as if chains are being placed on Poland and gradually tightened." The "Messenger" newspaper stated that 90% of Lithuania's foreign trade passes through the port of Memel, and in the future, it will inevitably have to rely on Germany. More generally, Germany's annexation of the Memel region will inevitably cause a major reaction in Europe. "The country will continue to advance this kind of bloodless warfare, and its movements constitute a crisis." (March 22nd, Havas Cable)

Warsaw  This morning's newspapers all carried the news of Memel's annexation into Germany in prominent positions, but no editorials have been published yet. The headlines are all very eye-catching, such as "The European Map Has Changed Again." The government has not yet made any statement on the matter, although the port of Memel has a significant relationship with Poland's export trade. Furthermore, all Polish newspapers hope that the government can implement an independent and autonomous policy. (March 22nd, Hai Tong Cable)

Warsaw  Polish political circles were not surprised that Lithuania handed Memel over to Germany today after learning about the results of the talks between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys, as well as Germany's demands. Polish political observers expressed disappointment over Germany's encroachment on the Baltic states and areas of particular interest to Poland. Polish newspapers paid close attention to the Memel incident, publishing it on the front page, but did not comment on it. (March 22nd, Associated Press)

### French Press Commentary

(Paris) Today's newspapers here recorded Hitler's new move against Lithuania in a frightened tone. "Le Temps" stated that Germany's actions in Memel have proven that resistance is impossible when peace-loving countries have not formed a solid group. Germany does not hesitate to attack weak countries, but will repeatedly consider before engaging in speculative actions that risk certain failure. As current events are progressing rapidly, democracies must not lose any time. (March 22nd, Reuters Cable)

### President Roosevelt Concerned About the European Situation

Feels Quite Unhappy

(Washington) President Roosevelt told reporters today that he was very unhappy with the current situation, but declined to comment on the developments in Central Europe, only stating that the rumors that he had advocated a general economic boycott of Germany were unfounded. (March 22nd, Reuters Cable)

### US Note to Germany: Contents Announced

Neutrality Law Amendment Expected to Pass Congress

(Washington) Regarding Germany's annexation of the Bohemian and Moravian provinces of Czechoslovakia, US Under Secretary of State Welles sent a note to German Chargé d'Affaires Thomsen on the 20th of this month, stating that it "lacked legal basis" and therefore refused to recognize it. The State Department recently released the main contents of the note as follows: "The Bohemian and Moravian provinces are now placed under German jurisdiction. The United States government, upon learning of this, believes that this move has absolutely no legal basis. The views of the United States government on the situation in Czechoslovakia and various events have been explained in a statement I issued on the 17th of this month, which is hereby copied and sent to your government for reference." (Note: Welles declared on that day, "Czechoslovakia's freedom has temporarily vanished with recent events, and the United States can only condemn this event.") Political figures here must comment on this note, saying that the United States condemned Germany's actions in a formal note and recognized the current situation as temporary. This is the first time the wording has been so firm, enough to encourage various democracies in Europe to resist the expansionist policies promoted by German leader Hitler. Moreover, the new Neutrality Act proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman can be easily passed due to the government's firm attitude towards Germany, because most of the public opinion circles sympathize with the democracies, and the opposition senators seem unwilling to risk being criticized. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the new Neutrality Act, and Under Secretary of State Welles may attend and deliver a speech, explaining the government's views. In addition, Welles also declared when meeting with reporters from various newspapers that the United States government is currently maintaining close contact with various democracies, but no country has sent any diplomatic documents to the United States. For example, when British Ambassador Lindsay visited yesterday, he did not make any concrete suggestions. (March 22nd, Havas Cable)

(Washington) According to inquiries in Congress, regarding Senator Pittman's neutrality resolution, the public believes that the House will follow the Senate's actions. It is also known here that if the Senate approves the bill, the House is expected to approve it soon after. Supporters of the government believe that they can win enough votes to pass the bill, but it is expected that Republican Senators Nye and Borah will firmly oppose it, and even resort to sabotage. According to officials here, in the current state of public opinion, sabotage will be a weapon of doubtful effectiveness. (March 21st, Reuters Cable)

### US Navy Department Warns Soldiers to Beware of Seductive Spies

(Washington) The US Navy today resumed its wartime warning to sailors, "Beware of inquisitive women." An office in the Navy has a sign that says, "Beware of female spies." Navy Department officials said that this kind of announcement is quite "strange," but in these eventful times, such advice is highly commendable. (March 22nd, Associated Press)

### German-Romanian Agreement Postponed Signing

Some of the Requirements Proposed by Germany Accepted by Romania

Rome  Economic negotiations between Romania and Germany have been going on for a long time. The agreement was originally scheduled to be signed tomorrow to supplement the commercial treaty of last November. According to officials here, both parties have agreed that the current negotiations are too sensational and have agreed to sign the agreement only after the international tense situation eases. German representative Walther is scheduled to return to Berlin tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, Romania has accepted some of the requirements proposed by Germany, agreeing to plant soybeans, increase the exchange rate of the Romanian Leu against the Mark, and allow a certain oil well to be developed by a German company. As for the request that all of Romania's oil production should be sold to Germany, it has been rejected. (March 21st, Havas Cable)

(Paris) According to news received here, Britain's announcement of sending a commercial delegation to Romania has created an excellent impression in Bucharest. It is heard that Romanian political circles feel that with Britain's assistance, Romania will be able to negotiate treaties with Germany on an equal footing. (March 21st, Reuters Cable)

### London Becomes a Diplomatic Center: Organizing an Anti-Aggression Front

Four Powers Discuss Draft of Joint Declaration

Poland Refuses to Participate, but the US is Willing to Offer Support

(Paris) The center of French diplomatic activity has now shifted to London, so the diplomatic scene in Paris is currently quite quiet. However, it is impossible not to feel anxious about the situation in Memel and Southeastern Europe. It is heard that Romania and Hungary are both mobilizing, each citing the other's large-scale troop movements as the reason. Parisians are closely watching Italy's attitude. As far as is known here, Italy has not sent a congratulatory telegram to Berlin for Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. (March 21st, Reuters Cable)

(London) Responsible individuals here recently stated that the draft of the joint declaration against aggression proposed by the British government is not a final draft and can be amended if necessary. Britain, France, Poland, and the Soviet Union are continuing negotiations on the principles and all the details of the declaration. (March 22nd, Havas Cable)

(London) Regarding the issue of organizing a collective security system in Eastern Europe, it is learned that the British draft, in its entirety, consists of only a few words, advocating that all peace-loving countries must unite and consult each other immediately in case of emergency in order to "decide on steps to resist aggression." Well-informed sources here commented that Poland's refusal to participate in the British plan is due to the fact that the country has always opposed the collective security system, and there is no other reason involved. Polish Ambassador to Britain Raczynski had a conversation with French Foreign Minister Bonnet this morning, presumably also to discuss this issue. (March 22nd, Havas Cable)

(London) Responsible individuals here recently declared that the British government has proposed to France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Romania that they issue a joint declaration stating that if any of the participating countries are subjected to aggression, the other countries should unite to "resist." The British government has also notified the Balkan countries of this proposal. Other countries threatened by Germany's outward expansion are also welcome to join. It is learned that Polish Ambassador Raczynski delivered the Polish government's answer to the Foreign Office this morning, expressing his refusal. The ambassador reportedly stated that Poland has an alliance treaty with France on one hand and can directly negotiate with Romania on the other, so there is no need to join this declaration. The general opinion is that the Polish authorities fear that accepting the British proposal will be regarded as a provocative move by Germany, so they are staying out of it. However, the British government's determination to organize a united front to resist Germany's expansion will not be abandoned due to Poland's passivity. Foreign Secretary Halifax told Romanian Minister Tilea, when he met him today, that the British government would never abandon Romania. (March 21st, Havas Cable)

(Washington) According to reliable sources, if the proposed anti-aggression declaration is signed by European powers, the United States will be willing to issue a similar declaration itself. (March 21st, Reuters Cable)

(London) The British government, fearing that Germany will make further moves in the Baltic Sea, is trying to create a pan-European united front. Regarding Germany's intention to abolish the Anglo-German naval agreement, Britain has issued a warning, stating that if Germany takes this step, Britain will never recognize it. Poland advocates the establishment of a military alliance as proposed by the Soviet Union, which is somewhat in conflict with Britain's common front plan. However, Britain has now drafted a declaration and handed it over to France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, so that the four countries can immediately consult each other on measures to take in the event of further political aggression. After a long talk between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday, the French side has, in principle, agreed to Britain's draft. Poland has asked Britain to do its best to protect Lithuania, as Memel is in imminent danger. German troop movements are very busy along the Baltic coast. Although the German side has denied it, it is impossible to conceal it, so the focus of the situation has now shifted to this aspect. (March 22nd, Associated Press)

(London) Regarding the issue of organizing a collective security system in Eastern Europe, after the British government put forward its plan, various autonomous regions and certain European countries have submitted answers. The British Cabinet therefore held a meeting at 10 am this morning to discuss them. As for Britain and France, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Foreign Secretary Halifax are scheduled to continue talks this afternoon. (March 22nd, Havas Cable)

(London) According to the diplomatic correspondent of the "Observer," the common declaration advocated by Britain, announcing that the four major powers will unite to deal with Germany's continued aggression, will be expressed in broad terms. It is heard that the document does not contain concrete restrictions or detailed clauses. The Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the governments of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland are currently considering the full text of the declaration, and no official news is likely to be released before tomorrow or Thursday. Although the Soviet and Polish governments want to include clauses in the document to bind the signatory countries to take concrete actions, it is now believed that all circles in Britain advocate the immediate publication of a broadly worded declaration without excluding the possibility of concrete military tasks. Britain's proposal also does not exclude the possibility of holding an international conference afterwards. If the signatory countries wish to convene this conference, Britain is willing to support it, but feels that holding this conference in the current crisis is extremely inconvenient, especially if this conference is held in Bucharest, as the Soviet Union has reportedly suggested. Britain's intention is that if the tasks to be reviewed and determined at present are not completed hastily, it will take too long and will not be of immediate help. It is also firmly stated here that the drafting of the declaration is currently in consultation with the Soviet Union, and it should not be considered that the procedure is emphasized, and the general principle is secondary. London is now paying close attention to Italy's attitude. The public opinion is that Mussolini's speech on Sunday will undoubtedly clarify Italy's attitude. The return of Italian Ambassador to Berlin Attolico to Rome has aroused comment in diplomatic circles here. According to rumors in Paris, France is seeking to negotiate with Italy, but Paris has so far denied this. Polish Ambassador to London Raczynski and Turkish Ambassador Orge today both met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax. French Foreign Minister Bonnet, accompanied by French President Lebrun, reported that they will meet with the Foreign Secretary tomorrow, and the two seem to be discussing the four-power declaration and all the concrete ways of that book. (March 21st, Reuters Cable)

### Military Mutual Assistance to Cope with the Crisis: Britain and France Share the Same Views

(Paris) After French Foreign Minister Bonnet arrived in London yesterday, he had his first meeting with the British Foreign Secretary that evening. Official sources revealed this morning that the two sides' opinions were quite harmonious. It is said that the theme of the talks was to discuss increasing the close relationship between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the Balkan countries and forming a strong front to counter Germany's aggression against Romania. It is heard that Britain is also holding talks with Yugoslavia and Turkey. (March 22nd, Hai Tong Cable)

(London) French Foreign Minister Bonnet, following President Lebrun, has arrived here and had a one-hour meeting with Foreign Secretary Halifax, and is scheduled to continue the talks tomorrow, when Prime Minister Chamberlain may also participate. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Halifax will clearly explain the British government's views and believes that it would be extremely dangerous for Britain to pursue an isolationist policy at this time, so it has decided to adopt a defensive mutual assistance policy. In other words, in addition to maintaining military mutual assistance obligations with France, if the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland are attacked in the future, Britain will immediately provide assistance with all its forces. In addition, regarding Germany's threat to Romania, Britain and France are consulting the Balkan countries for their opinions and will decide on their final attitude after these countries submit their answers. (March 21st, Havas Cable)

### Supreme Council of the Italian Fascist Party Passes Important Resolutions

The Rome-Berlin Axis Remains Steadfast in Responding to the Threat from the Democratic Front

(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party held a meeting at 10 pm tonight in the Palazzo Venezia to discuss the European situation, with Prime Minister Mussolini personally presiding. Government authorities had heavily guarded outside the palace in advance, while the Prime Minister's Blackshirt Guards were responsible for guarding the palace. Various important figures of the Fascist Party arrived one after another before 10 pm, including Ambassador to Britain Grandi, Minister of Education Bottai, and Governor of Libya General Balbo, who arrived the earliest. The Prime Minister himself entered the palace through the back door a few minutes before 10 pm. (March 21st, Havas Cable)

(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party held a meeting in the Palazzo Venezia from 10 pm last night until 12:45 am this morning. It immediately issued a communiqué stating that the current meeting had thoroughly discussed the international situation and recent events in Central Europe, and finally passed a resolution as follows: The current meeting believes that the recent changes in Central Europe were caused by the Treaty of Versailles. At the same time, in view of the fact that various democracies are gradually colluding with Bolshevism to form a united front against the totalitarian countries, it believes that this move does not contribute to peace, but rather is sufficient to cause war. Therefore, it declares that Italy must remain steadfast in its commitment to the Berlin-Rome political axis. (March 22nd, Havas Cable)

### Italy's True Intentions Await Prime Minister Mussolini's Explanation

(Rome) Diplomatic circles here recently commented on the communiqué issued by the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party, saying that Italy's re-declaration of its adherence to the Rome-Berlin Axis in the current situation is of great significance. This announcement is intended to respond to those foreigners who hope to alienate Germany and Italy. In addition, in view of the extremely brief content of the announcement, people are looking forward to Prime Minister Mussolini's speech to be delivered in the coming days, because Italy's attitude towards various important issues in Europe depends on the Prime Minister's explanation. (March 22nd, Havas Cable)

### The Policies of Japan, Germany, and Italy Have Promoted the Alliance Between the Democracies and the Communists

(Washington) The communiqué issued by the Supreme Council of the Italian Fascist Party has recently been commented on by political figures here, saying that the Berlin-Rome political axis will not disintegrate. As for the communiqué's claim that Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia was due to the unfair clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and that Italy recognized it as reasonable, the American view is that certain parts of this treaty can be criticized, but it is inappropriate for various totalitarian countries to use this as an excuse to revise it by force. Also, the communiqué's claim that "various democracies intend to collude with Bolshevism to form a united front" is the inevitable result of the policies pursued by Germany, Italy, and Japan, and is not surprising.

### A Close Confidant of the Italian Prime Minister Suddenly Arrives in Paris

A Symbol of Improved Franco-Italian Relations

(Paris) Newspapers here believe that the news that the legal advisor to the French Embassy in Italy, de la Gardelle, arrived in Paris today is a symbol that Franco-Italian relations are likely to improve, because de la Gardelle is a friend of Mussolini's, and this visit may be with the mission of conveying Italy's views. Considering that after arriving in Paris, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and many government offices, it is obviously politically significant. It is recalled that the success of the Franco-Italian agreement in 1935, as well as the most urgent season of the international situation last September, were also times of de la Gardelle's unusual activity. This decision to come to France is by no means an ordinary tour. (March 22nd, Hai Tong Cable)

### The Netherlands and Denmark Strictly Adhere to Neutrality

Amsterdam  The director of the Netherlands Intelligence Department declared that the Dutch government will consistently adhere to its neutrality policy, regardless of any external threats. Rumors that the Netherlands has adopted an attitude towards the situation in Central Europe are completely inconsistent with the facts. (March 22nd, Hai Tong Cable)

Copenhagen, Denmark  Danish Prime Minister Stauning said today that the leader of the Danish Nazi Party, Clausen, has expressed himself in a way that we must consider to be an appeal to Germany to treat Denmark in the same way as it treated Czechoslovakia. However, Denmark does not want to interfere in the affairs of other countries, nor does it want others to interfere in our affairs. We have treated the German minority within Denmark in a tolerant manner. (March 22nd, Reuters Cable)

### President Lebrun Visits London: Grand Banquet at Buckingham Palace

The Heads of State Concerned About the Overall Situation

Mutual Encouragement for Peace and Cooperation

(London) French President Lebrun, accompanied by his wife, arrived here today. Victoria Station, the area in front of Buckingham Palace, and the streets along the route were thronged with crowds, creating a grand spectacle. The recent changes in the situation have further strengthened the relationship between Britain and France. Therefore, the people's welcome for the French President and his wife's visit to Britain was even more enthusiastic. Flags were flying everywhere along the route, and troops were lined up. The British King and Queen greeted them at Victoria Station. After President Lebrun and his wife alighted from the train, they shook hands with the King and Queen respectively and were introduced to prominent figures, including the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. After the King and the President reviewed the honor guard, they boarded the official car. The King's brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Duke of Kent accompanied the President's party from Dover to London. The Queen and the President's wife then boarded the second official car. Upon arriving at Buckingham Palace, the cheers of the crowds outside the palace gate were incessant. The King and the French President and his wife appeared on the balcony to thank them. The people were extremely excited and broke through the security cordon to shout loudly in front of the palace. Within an hour and a half of the French President's arrival in London, all the welcoming scenes had been broadcast to the West End cinemas. In the afternoon, the French President and his wife visited Queen Mary at Marlborough House. The people along the route held small British and French flags, vying to see the President's elegance, resulting in extreme congestion, and the vehicles could not travel quickly. The President and others then went to the new building of the French Institute in South Kensington to attend the opening ceremony of the institute. In the evening, a grand banquet was held at Buckingham Palace to welcome the President and his entourage. There were a total of one hundred and ninety-five guests, including the British Queen Mother, creating a very grand occasion. (Reuter, 21st)

(London) King George VI and Queen Elizabeth hosted a banquet for French President Lebrun and his wife in the Grand Ballroom of Buckingham Palace at exactly 10:00 PM. The King wore the full dress uniform of an Admiral of the Navy, with the Grand Cross of the French Legion of Honor on his chest. The Queen wore a long white satin gown. After President Lebrun and his wife arrived, they were accompanied by the King's third brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Lord Chamberlain to the drawing room to meet the King and Queen. Other guests then proceeded one by one to bow to the King, Queen, and the President and his wife. At the start of the banquet, the guests sat around a horseshoe-shaped long table, and the Scottish band played famous tunes. After the King and President Lebrun finished their speeches, the Scottish band circled the table, playing as they walked, and only after one piece was finished did they leave the dining room and go to the "Whitehall" and "Blue Room" to rest. The speeches made by the King and the President at the banquet are recorded below:

King George VI first stated that regarding the various serious problems that have occurred throughout the world, the governments of both our countries have made every effort to find friendly solutions. However, neither side will sign or join any agreement that does not conform to the correct principles of international relations. The similarity of the civil systems of our two countries can be seen in the fact that both sides regard freedom and justice as the guiding principles. The politicians of both our countries uphold the rule of law and have consulted each other in full confidence, hoping to contribute to peace. The people of both countries are brave and intelligent and are able to calmly deal with dangerous problems whenever they arise. We possess these virtues and will undoubtedly be able to overcome the current difficulties.

President Lebrun then replied, saying that when the principles contained in international law are violated, both our countries have the same sense of unease. The principles that both sides adhere to are the same, such as "honor, justice, human dignity, respect for treaties and promises, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, all of which are adhered to by both countries without change. Not only that, but both sides are unwilling to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and both love peace. No matter where external force is oppressed, public opinion in the country demands that the government strengthen national defense in order to protect national security on the one hand and promote world peace on the other." There are so many things in common between the two countries that it is only appropriate for both sides to maintain close ties. As for the present, the authorities of both our countries are working hard to restore international confidence, hoping to achieve success as soon as possible. (Havas, 21st)

### Envoys from Various Countries Attend the Banquet

Only the German and Italian Ambassadors Were Absent

(London) According to an official bulletin released by the inner court, when the King and Queen hosted a banquet for French President Lebrun and his wife at Buckingham Palace last night, envoys from various countries were invited to attend. The German and Italian ambassadors were absent due to "impossible" circumstances. German Ambassador Dirksen has already returned to his country to report on his duties, and Italian Ambassador Grandi has also returned to Rome to attend the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party. (Havas, 22nd)

### Romania Strengthens Border Defenses; Reservists Called Up

Rumor that Germany is Encouraging Hungary to Attack Romania to Recover Land Lost in the European War

Bucharest: The State Council recently issued a bulletin stating that after the government recently called up several classes of reservists, they have been transferred to the border to strengthen defenses. However, their location is still a considerable distance from the border, and they are only conducting exercises and not taking any other military actions. Once the neighboring countries cancel their mobilizations, these troops will be dismissed. In addition, the authorities have taken various military measures in the vicinity of the capital, and a survey of residents with military service obligations has been completed, so that they can be called up when necessary. (Havas, 21st)

Bucharest: People in political circles are quite uneasy about Germany's attitude after Hungary occupied Carpatho-Ukraine. It is generally believed that Germany may incite Hungary to attack Romania to recover Outer Transylvania (formerly Hungarian before the European War, now part of Romania), and Germany will share a portion of it. If not, they will also make demands on Romania as a reward for maintaining neutrality. One of the two must be the case. (Havas, 21st)

### Santo Domingo Agrees to Germany Establishing Submarine Base; Agreement to Be Signed Soon

(New York) The New York Min Sheng Qing Tan Bao recently published a telegram from a reporter in San Juan, Puerto Rico, stating that the President of the Dominican Republic, Trujillo, is about to sign an agreement with Germany allowing Germany to establish a submarine base on the coast of the Dominican Republic and to supply German submarines with gasoline in the Caribbean Sea. (Havas, 22nd)

### Syria Situation Unstable; French Troops Deployed

Damascus, Syria: After the disturbances caused by the Nationalist Party here, French troops occupied various key locations yesterday. Demonstrators from the Nationalist Party had erected obstacles in various places using overturned trucks and stones, surrounded by barbed wire, and connected to the city's power plant to carry an electric current. The first action of the French troops was to demolish these obstacles. The city is still peaceful today, but many shop owners, fearing looting, have moved all the goods from their shops. The main instigators have been arrested. (Reuter, 21st)

### Frequent Diplomatic Activity in Warsaw

Envoys from Various Countries Visit Foreign Minister Beck; Britain Ready to Loan Poland to Develop Industry

Warsaw: Diplomatic activity in Warsaw was unusually frequent yesterday. The French Ambassador, Noël, the Italian Ambassador, Russi, the British Ambassador, Gortchy, and the Belgian and Lithuanian Ministers all visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs one after another to call on the Polish foreign authorities. The most noteworthy was the visit of the Lithuanian Minister, Škirpa, to the Polish Foreign Office to discuss the Memel issue. Škirpa immediately telegraphed the results of the meeting to the Lithuanian capital. It is decided that the discussion between British Ambassador Gortchy and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck concerned Britain's preparation to lend Poland 25 million pounds to develop the industry in the San River area.

### Soviet Communist Party Congress Concludes; Many New Faces Among Those Elected to the Central Committee

Proof that the Purge Movement Has Ended

(Moscow) The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held its last meeting on the evening of March 21. Chairman Andreyev and Shvernik announced the results of the elections for the Party Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission. The election was conducted by secret ballot. The results proved the unity of the entire party, which was unprecedented in any previous congress, and confirmed the strength and unity of the party united under the leadership of the Central Committee and Stalin. When Andreyev announced the closing of the congress, all the delegates stood up and paid tribute to Stalin with unprecedented enthusiasm, shouting "Long Live Stalin" and "Great Stalin Hurrah" in various national languages. Finally, the 18th Congress concluded all its work with all the delegates singing the Internationale. (TASS, 22nd)

(Moscow) The new Central Committee of the Communist Party elected before the close of the Communist Party Congress is sufficient to indicate the major political changes following the mass purges of recent months. Of the seventy-one members elected, only sixteen are old members. Most notably, Yezhov, the former People's Commissar of Internal Affairs who was removed from office last December and who presided over the purge movement, is not among them. Only a few months ago, he was one of the most powerful men in the Soviet Union. Yezhov was not even a delegate to the congress, and his name was nowhere to be found. This is sufficient proof that the purge has come to an end. (Reuter, 22nd)

(Moscow) The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has elected 71 members of the Central Committee, 68 alternate members, and 50 members of the Central Auditing Commission.

The members of the Central Committee include Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, L. Kaganovich, Kalinin, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Zhdanov, Khrushchev, Beria, G. Malenkov, A. Poskrebyshev, A.

### Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Discuss Diplomatic Matters

(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita met with Prime Minister Hiranuma at his private residence yesterday afternoon and talked for three hours. It is reported that they exchanged views on diplomatic matters, with particular emphasis on the Soviet-Japanese fisheries dispute. (Reuter, 22nd)

### Japan-Italy Cultural Agreement to Be Signed Today

(Tokyo) The Japan-Italy Cultural Agreement has been approved by the Diet and is now scheduled to be formally signed on the 23rd of this month. Its contents are the same as those of the German-Japanese Cultural Agreement. (Haitong, 22nd)

### British House of Commons Debates Foreign Budget

(London) When the British House of Commons debated the foreign budget today, it was mentioned that £6,000 was allocated to Reuters to subsidize part of the telegraphic fees incurred by the agency in sending extra telegrams to foreign countries during the tense international situation last autumn. Labor MP Fletcher stated that he did not attack Reuters' business principles or overall morality, nor did he endorse the saying that the agency was biased. However, what he wanted to know was whether the telegrams for which the House was asked to approve a subsidy of £6,000 were limited to opinions and criticisms favorable to the government, or whether they also included criticisms of the government's foreign policy. He also wanted to know whether the newspapers of the self-governing territories published Reuters' telegrams, and to what extent they did so. A newspaper in Singapore had criticized Reuters' telegrams, and the American news agency was now planning to use this payment to damage Reuters' credibility, claiming that Reuters was receiving government subsidies. Labor MP Noel-Baker stated that Reuters had a large annual turnover, and £6,000 was a very small amount for Reuters. However, overseas, it would damage Reuters' reputation and create the impression that Reuters' telegrams were under the influence of the government. Reuters has always been independent in its news gathering and dissemination and does not need subsidies. The reason why it is prepared to accept this help is only because it is of great importance to Britain that British news be reviewed and disseminated to the world by British people rather than foreigners. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that the subsidy to Reuters was purely a temporary measure, and its purpose was to send more British news. As for the content of Reuters' telegrams, it was entirely up to them. Conservative MP Stoker stated that there were two fiercely competing newspapers in Singapore. One of them wanted to use news from other news agencies to supplement the deficiencies of Reuters, so it criticized Reuters' news. As for the claim that Reuters enjoyed a news monopoly in Malaya and India, it was not true. Because Reuters had a great organization, it distributed expenses everywhere, so it was able to disseminate its news at a price that other companies could not compete with. If Reuters did not have this organization, it would not be able to compete with foreign news agencies that received large subsidies. No British news agency other than Reuters was capable of undertaking this kind of business. As for the situation in South America, it was necessary to consider carefully to avoid the rumor that Reuters was controlled by the government because Reuters accepted this subsidy. However, Reuters could accept this subsidy on one condition, that it undertake other remuneration besides sending more telegrams. (Reuter, 21st)

### British Trade Minister Goes to Moscow

Satisfied with Talks in Warsaw

Warsaw: British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson left here this morning for Moscow. Part of the delegation remained in Warsaw. (Haitong, 22nd)

Warsaw: British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson, after holding talks with the Polish government authorities here, told reporters that the talks had been "very satisfactory." Political issues such as the redistribution of colonies and raw materials were not brought up for discussion and would only be discussed when Foreign Minister Beck visits London next month. As far as is generally known, what Hudson discussed with the Polish authorities was mainly to promote trade, that is, to increase both the quantity of timber, eggs, and ham purchased by Britain and the quantity of industrial products purchased by Poland. In addition, the Polish government recently opened an industrial zone in the vicinity of Sandomierz in order to develop the armaments industry and thereby strengthen its national defense. It is reported that Hudson and the Polish authorities considered the issue of British investment during this visit. (Havas, 21st)

Warsaw: British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson held a long conversation with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck last night. The content concerned the issue of Poland joining the British-French highway. At the same time, Poland's relations with the Baltic countries were also discussed. Regarding commerce, Poland hopes that Britain will loan money to help Poland import Indian copper and tin and cotton from British colonies. (Haitong, 22nd)

### Czech National Spirit Unbowed

Hatred of Germany at 90 Percent

Prague: According to statistics from foreign observers in Prague today, approximately 90 percent of Czechs still harbor great animosity towards German rule in the Czech Republic. They expect that these Czechs will reuse the tricks they used when they were previously under Austro-Hungarian rule. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Hacha Orders Dissolution of Parliament

Czech Republic: After existing for twenty years, the Czech Parliament came to an end yesterday. Czech President Hacha has sent the resolution to dissolve Parliament to Prime Minister Beran for execution. From now on, Bohemia and Moravia will have a one-party government and be subject to the complete control of the Protectorate. (Reuter, 22nd)

### Czech Air Force Unwilling to Surrender to Germany

(London) According to a report in the "Daily Express" last night, approximately a thousand Czech fighter planes and most of the pilots are unwilling to obey German orders that all Czech aircraft should surrender to Germany. It is reported that they have flown to Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union. According to the Associated Press' investigation into this report, it has been officially confirmed that two Czech aircraft arrived in Romania on Wednesday to avoid being seized by Germany. Other reports have not yet been confirmed. (Associated Press, 21st)

(London) Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied in the House of Commons today that, as far as he knew, the German annexation of Bohemia and Moravia would not affect its army manpower. Asked whether it was true that the former Czech Republic had first-class equipment for a modern army, including 700 first-class aircraft and the entire Skoda factory, Butler said that it was difficult to provide information on this point. Conservative MP Walter stated that the caliber of the Czech heavy artillery and rifles was different from that used by the German army, and Germany's gains were not as great as generally claimed. (Reuter, 21st)

### Powerful Guarantee of Victory in the War of Resistance: Economic Construction Achieves Rapid Progress

Establishment of Factories for Machinery, Copper, Antimony, and Electrical Equipment

Assisting the Relocation of More Than 300 Private Factories Inland

Increasing Cotton and Wheat Production to Protect Industrial and Commercial Development

Special Dispatch from Chongqing to This Newspaper: The Ministry of Economic Affairs was established in January of last year by merging the former Ministry of Industry, the Construction Committee, and the water conservancy section of the National Economic Council, along with their directly subordinate agencies. The National Government specially appointed Ong Wen-hao, the former Minister of the Third and Fourth Departments of the Military Affairs Commission, as the Minister. Adapting to the needs of wartime, he meticulously planned the internal structure, setting up six departments: General Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, Mining, Industry, Commerce, and Water Conservancy. In addition to the original bureaus, offices, departments, and committees of the above-mentioned agencies, in the area of agriculture and forestry, a new Agricultural Adjustment Office was established under the Agricultural Foundation Bureau to handle agricultural adjustment affairs during the extraordinary period, and a Cooperative Guidance Office was established to promote cooperative enterprises. A Central Agricultural Experiment Institute was also established to manage agricultural and forestry experiments, improvements, investigations, research, and technical personnel training. The Jinshui River Basin Farm was established to manage agricultural affairs in the Jinshui River Basin near Wuchang, and an Agricultural Review Committee was established to discuss and study agricultural construction plans. In the area of industry and mining, a special Industry and Mining Adjustment Office was established to handle industry and mining adjustment affairs during the extraordinary period, a Mining Research Institute was established to study mining techniques, a Fuel Management Office was established to plan the production, transportation, distribution, and storage of fuel during the extraordinary period, and a Central Industrial Experiment Institute was established to examine industrial raw materials, improve manufacturing methods, and appraise industrial products. A Resources Committee was established to develop and manage important resources, and a Small Industry Promotion and Design Committee was jointly established with the Ministries of Education and Internal Affairs to design and increase production capacity. In the area of water conservancy, a Central Hydraulic Experiment Institute was established to conduct hydraulic experiments and water conservancy research, and the Jingluo Engineering Bureau and the Meihui Canal Management Office were established to handle all affairs related to the Meihui Canal. In addition, a special Petition Review Committee was established to handle petition cases, and a Joint Venture Supervision Committee was established to supervise various joint ventures. Over the past year, the Ministry has been strategizing and planning, working diligently for the country, and has been meticulous in all matters that can develop the national economy. Everything has been restored. I recently visited the Minister and was given a detailed account of the economic administrative measures taken over the past year. I have recorded them to inform the readers of this newspaper.

### Constructing Agriculture

The economic administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs since its establishment can be discussed under four headings: agriculture, industry and mining, commerce, and water conservancy projects. (1) Agriculture: The following six aspects of agricultural production are given special attention: (A) Farmland Water Conservancy: The weather in the Northwest is dry, and irrigation is especially important. Many water channel projects have been implemented in Shaanxi Province. The Meihui Canal has been completed, irrigating 200,000 mu of land. The Luohe Canal project is the largest and is still in progress, irrigating 500,000 mu of land. The Qianhui Canal, irrigating 200,000 mu of land, and the Heihei Canal, irrigating 100,000 mu of land, both began construction last winter. Within Gansu Province, the Taohei Canal has now been completed, and the Niehei Canal will begin construction this spring. Each can irrigate tens of thousands of mu. Various provinces in the Southwest are also proceeding separately. In Sichuan, a total of 200,000 mu of land can be irrigated, 190,000 mu in Guangxi, and approximately 200,000 mu in Hunan. Compared to the Northwest, the cost is often higher, but less land is irrigated. Land should also be selected for implementation in Yunnan and Guizhou. (B) Increasing Agricultural Production: It is stipulated that grain production should be increased in the Northwest and cotton production should be increased in the Southwest. The harvest last year was estimated by the Agricultural Experiment Institute to be higher than the previous year. Wheat fields in Shaanxi Province increased by 2 million mu, and production increased by 12 million dan. Cotton production in Sichuan was more than 900,000 dan, approximately double that of the previous year. This was because the government increased the purchase, transportation, and distribution of 58 million dan of American cotton seeds and promoted cotton fields on more than 74,000 mu. Plans are now being made to continue this work. (C) Planning for Land Reclamation: The emphasis is on dispatching specialized personnel to various provinces to investigate the conditions of wasteland and discuss reclamation methods. The provinces that have already implemented resettlement are Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The Ministry has also consulted with relevant ministries and commissions and drafted rules for the resettlement of refugees during the extraordinary period, which have been promulgated by government order and can serve as the basis for local handling of reclamation affairs. (D) Developing Cooperation: Recently, great efforts have been made to promote cooperative treasuries to establish the basic institutions of rural finance. As of the upper ten days of December last year, 47 treasuries had been established, distributed in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces. The share capital subscribed to was approximately 7 million yuan, and the actual subscribers were 2.5 million yuan. At the same time, agricultural warehouses are being newly established in various places in the rear area. A total of 20 have recently been established, and 40 are under planning, mostly in Sichuan Province. This is because agricultural warehouses have not yet adjusted the basic organization of production and sales. (E) Agricultural Loans: In Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces, the Ministry cooperates with local governments undertaking water conservancy projects to provide farmland water conservancy loans. There are also production loans, including the provision of seeds, fertilizers, and draft cattle, which are even more widely distributed. As of November last year, the former had been set at 8.3 million yuan, and the latter had been set at 4.871 million yuan. In addition, there are commercial agricultural product loans totaling 2 million yuan and agricultural improvement subsidies totaling more than 81,000 yuan. (F) Agricultural Product Transportation and Sales: Grain is transported to the rear area in Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi, and cotton and cotton cloth are transported in Shaanxi, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang. As of November last year, a total of cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rice, wheat, etc. worth 10,175,600 yuan had been purchased. In addition, transportation and sales loans totaling 2.7 million yuan have been organized in the three provinces of Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou.

### Developing Industry and Mining

(2) For industry and mining, all facilities are primarily aimed at increasing production capacity in the rear, developing important inland production, and supplying urgent national defense needs. This will be done through either state-run enterprises or incentivizing private enterprises, advancing on both fronts simultaneously. (A) State-run enterprises generally require more capital and aim to establish scale, quickly achieve results, focus on increasing national industry rather than competing with private interests, strive to create models for business operation, and fulfill their responsibility to contribute to national welfare and people's livelihood. 1. To supply basic materials necessary for national defense, discussions have been held with the Ordnance Department to relocate important components of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works and the Daye Iron Mine inland, and the Liuhegou Iron Smelter has also been purchased and transported for the purpose of selecting a site to build another copper and iron plant, costing over ten million yuan. Furthermore, the Resources Committee has established a copper plant in Hunan to refine pure copper and is now building another one in Sichuan, while also acquiring raw copper from Sichuan and Kangding and jointly operating the Dianbei Copper Mine in Yunnan to increase production, aiming to supply at least a portion of the demand. Oil exploration and production is also being conducted in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. 2. To establish basic manufacturing industries, a machinery factory has been established in Yunnan Province, with equipment worth approximately five million yuan, which can begin manufacturing industrial machinery, tools, and engines. In addition, four electrical equipment factories have been established in Yunnan and Guangxi, at a cost of five million yuan, capable of producing electric wires, telephones, vacuum tubes, light bulbs, batteries, transformers, and other items. An alcohol plant has been established in Sichuan to produce high-concentration ethyl alcohol. 3. To improve and develop important export minerals, tungsten and antimony mines are under centralized management, showing significant progress. The Resources Committee and the Guangxi Provincial Government have jointly established the Pinggui Mining Bureau, with a capital of five million yuan, which can increase tin production by a thousand tons per month. It has also jointly established the Shengxi Mercury Mine with Guizhou Province to increase mercury production. 4. To supply electricity for civilian and industrial use, electricity capacity is being increased in Lanzhou, Wanxian, Guiyang, and other places. New power plants are also being established in Hanzhong, Guiyang, and other places, costing approximately three million yuan. 5. To replenish foreign exchange reserves and strengthen finance, gold mines are being explored and produced in Qinghai, Sichuan, Kangding, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, and negotiations are being held with the Ministry of Finance to set prices and purchase gold from various regions. (B) Private enterprises: With the exception of a few important state-run enterprises, the economic construction of the entire country relies on the encouragement and assistance of private enterprises. The National Government has promulgated and revised the "Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Extraordinary Period" to provide a basis for the competent authorities to supervise and lead. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently drafted the "Regulations on Incentives and Assistance for Industry and Mining During the Extraordinary Period," which has also been promulgated by the National Government, with the aim of providing further assistance beyond what is stipulated in normal laws and regulations. It has also drafted "Measures for Incentives and Assistance for Overseas Chinese Investment in Domestic Economic Enterprises During the Extraordinary Period" to utilize the resources of overseas Chinese and promote the development of the inland economy.

### Assisting Factory Relocations

For military reasons, to protect forward equipment and increase inland production, the government has provided various forms of assistance. Initially, the machinery, materials, and technical personnel of most factories along the coast were relocated to Wuhan, and then further relocated to the northwestern and southwestern provinces, where they were urged to resume production. This work became more urgent in the second half of last year. Factories and mines in Daye, Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou were all relocated amidst the disturbance of bombs. Important enterprises, such as the Hua Kee Cement Plant, Hanyang Iron and Steel Works, and the Yuhua, Shenxin, Zhenhuan, and other cotton mills, as well as the Lihua and Yuanhua coal mines, were all successfully relocated. As of December 15th, a total of 341 private factories and mines had been relocated with government assistance, including 142 relocated to Sichuan, with a total weight of over 65,200 tons of machinery. Including the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works and the Liuhegou Iron Smelter, the total weight of relocated machinery was probably as much as 120,000 to 130,000 tons. Textile factories accounted for over 30,000 tons, coal mining machinery and hardware machinery factories each accounted for over 8,000 tons, electrical factories and ceramic factories each accounted for over 3,000 tons, and chemical factories accounted for over 2,000 tons. Private factories were also assisted by the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office with loans totaling approximately five million yuan, and loans were also provided for the purchase of materials to meet the needs for one year, with loans totaling approximately three and a half million yuan. To urge them to resume production as soon as possible, special regulations were formulated for resuming production, divided into three types: temporary resumption, formal resumption, and merger resumption. Resumption deadlines were stipulated for various industrial natures. Those who fail to resume production within the deadline will be warned, and the time may be extended based on the actual situation. If production is still not resumed, assistance requests may be rejected, or methods may be determined to utilize all equipment.

The government also strongly encourages important industries originally located inland, such as the Lihuang Iron Factory, the Hubei Factory, the Jiading Jiale Paper Mill, and the Guangxi sugar mills, oil mills, and alcohol plants, by allocating funds or arranging loans from banks. Such assistance is also being actively promoted. For example, the Tianfu Coal Mine on the Jialing River has added machinery with government introduction and assistance, and recent coal production can reach 800 to 1,000 tons per day, which is three or four times more than before. New coal mines are being developed at the junction of Sichuan and Guizhou in Nanchuan and Tongzi, and after the completion of the project, hundreds of tons can also be produced daily. Recently, the Jiayang Coal Mining Company has been organized in western Sichuan in cooperation with merchants to exploit coal in Qianwei, Leshan, and Pingshan, and hundreds of tons can also be produced daily after realization.

### Supporting Commerce

(3) Commerce (A) Foreign Trade: Because the Ministry of Finance has established a Trade Commission, it has been assigned to that commission for management. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs continues to strive to plan and promote trade to the extent of its authority. The trade of tungsten and antimony mines continues to be managed by the Resources Committee, making the largest contribution to international exchange of goods. The plant oil material factory and tea company co-organized by the former Ministry of Industry are also continuing to work hard. (B) Implement Economic Severance with Japan: Drafted regulations for prohibiting enemy goods and regulations for prohibiting the transport of materials to the enemy have been submitted to the National Government for promulgation, so that central and local agencies can jointly promote them within the scope of their responsibilities. The prohibition of transporting materials to the enemy was previously ordered sporadically, but now a comprehensive plan is being formulated for effective implementation. Regarding enemy goods, it is necessary to properly distinguish them from goods produced in occupied areas. Those that are indeed confiscated or controlled by the Japanese should be regarded as enemy goods, but other goods that are purely for the people to sell should be appropriately distinguished to avoid falling into Japan's monopoly. It is hoped that people in the community will provide more information about the industrial and commercial situation in various provinces so that we can understand the situation. (C) Commercial Management: Currently, the prices of various goods on the market in the rear are often rising sharply. Price increases caused by supply and demand relationships are unavoidable, but if unscrupulous merchants deliberately hoard goods and intentionally manipulate prices, methods should be devised to sanction them and stabilize prices in order to protect the public interest. A price evaluation committee has now been established jointly with relevant agencies to begin work. It is hoped that the local competent authorities will pay attention and assist in the progress at any time. For important items, such as the supply of fuel, a fuel management office has been specially established to thoroughly coordinate production, transportation, and consumption, and to effectively regulate supply and demand. Before the retreat from Wuhan, the amount of coal used was very large. On the one hand, the government urged coal mines in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces to increase production, increasing production by more than 1,000 tons per day. On the other hand, the management office prepared operating funds of 200,000 yuan to purchase coal produced by local kilns in various places, centralize transportation, and fully utilize shipping due to the busy military use of the railway. From July of last year until the withdrawal from Wuhan, more than 200,000 tons of bituminous coal from Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Henan, and other provinces were transported to Wuhan. The use of coal is also centrally allocated, divided into five types: military, navigation, public, commercial, and civilian, to conserve waste and supply urgent needs. Although the price has to be slightly increased compared to normal times due to the relationship between supply and demand and the increase in freight, it is still kept within a reasonable range to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding goods and to avoid excessive difficulties for coal users. Currently, Hunan Province and the Hunan-Guangxi Railway need 20,000 tons of bituminous coal per month, and Yichang and Shashi need about 10,000 tons per month, and we are working to supply them. The principle is to supply the needs of the front line with inland production. The active increase in coal production in Sichuan Province is one of the measures in the continuous fuel management work.

### Developing Waterways

(4) Waterway Engineering: Waterway transportation has always been the main route of transportation in the interior, saving expenses, widely distributed and should be used in conjunction with highways to strive for smooth flow. This project, which has now begun to be implemented, includes two places: (A) The Hunan-Guangxi Waterway: The Yangtze River Conservancy Commission has been ordered to organize a special office to cooperate with the Guangxi Provincial Government for management. The main project is between Quanxian and Guilin, with a length of 150 kilometers. The Lingqu section is in particular need of dredging. It is planned to blast reefs, build weirs and gates, and improve lock gates during the low water season to enable year-round navigation between Quanxian and Guilin, with wooden boats carrying seven tons of cargo and small steamers between Guilin and Wuzhou, with wooden boats carrying 20 tons of cargo year-round. (B) The Songkan River and Pushui River in the upper reaches of the Qijiang River in Sichuan: The Qijiang River was originally one of the four routes for Sichuan salt to enter Guizhou. Its upper reaches also have coal and iron ore production. Unfortunately, due to shallow water and rapid currents, as well as stone cover, Yangti, Luxia and other caves, wooden boats cannot go upstream. Therefore, six rolling dams and ship locks will be built during the low water season to enable the two rivers to reach a maximum transportation capacity of 1,200 tons per day. Personnel from the Chuan-Huai Committee have been assigned to complete the project within a time limit. In addition, the Jialing River waterway from Hechuan to Guangyuan in Sichuan, with a length of about 600 kilometers, the upper reaches of the Fujiang River from Mianyang to Pingwu (wooden boats carrying 40 tons of cargo can travel in the lower reaches), the 200-kilometer Gongtan-Fuling section, and the Wujiang River waterway from Sinan to Gongtan in Guizhou, the Yujiang-Zuojiang waterway from Guilin to Longzhou in Guangxi, with a length of about 700 kilometers (small steamers carrying 50 tons can travel year-round after improvement), the Lixi waterway from Longzhou to Nacen with a length of about 120 li, the Liujiang waterway from Liuzhou to Guiping with a length of 200 kilometers, the upper reaches of the Qingshui River from Lushan to Majiang in Guizhou, the Yuanjiang waterway from Taoyuan to Yuanling in Hunan with a length of about 170 kilometers (small steamers can travel after renovation), and the Jinghe River, which transports salt in the salt area of Sichuan (i.e. the Zigong area), are all being planned for improvement and renovation. It is planned to implement the project during the low water season so that it can be completed before the high water this year. (March 10)

### Japan's Xingzhong Company Seizes Salt Stockpiles in Haizhou

Qin Jieren and Others Tragically Killed

Haizhou Correspondence: After the Japanese army occupied Haizhou, many civilians were killed and injured, and the essence of the urban area was destroyed. Haizhou, which had been the economic center of northern Jiangsu, has become desolate. Except for Pastor Molen, who used four American churches to accommodate 2,500 refugees in the city of Haizhou, who were safe and sound, most of the others were harmed. The Haizhou salt field occupies the entire coastal line of Guanyun and Lianshui, covering an area of 30 square miles, with a large annual salt production. When the war broke out, the Salt Affairs Administration received orders to throw all the stockpiled salt into the sea when the Japanese army landed. This time, the Japanese army suddenly occupied Haizhou. Although the bureau had been ordered to throw the stockpiled salt into the sea, a portion of the village salt was not thrown away and was seized by Japan's Xingzhong Company. After the Japanese army occupied Haizhou, they immediately dispatched traitors to organize a maintenance association and funded the purchase of 400 bandits from the Southwest Pinging Street in Haizhou, led by the famous bandit leader Jie Shouyan, and reorganized them into the Haizhou Pacification Team. Qin Jieren, the former magistrate of Donghai County, and Shi Jingheng, the chief of the Xinpu Public Security Bureau, were arrested by the Japanese army and tragically beheaded in Shiqian. Those who heard about it mourned for them.

### What Has Become of Guisui Today?

Guisui Correspondence: Japanese diplomats repeatedly say that they have no territorial ambitions in China, but the facts prove that these are completely the sophistry of diplomats. Just look at Suiyuan, where the Japanese side is carrying out work to change the map, turning Guisui into "Hohhot City." All administration, transportation, and postal services have become completely Japanized. If you haven't traveled in North China, you certainly don't know about this strange "Hohhot City." Even the small circular postmark has become completely Japanized. Guisui has always had a high cultural status in North China. Since the Ping-Sui Railway was built, it has become a stronger cultural camp in the north, with extremely enthusiastic patriotic sentiments. We only need to look at the tension of the Japanese side's defense in Guisui to know that only a few unfilial elements are willing to be puppets of the people of Inner Mongolia. There is no doubt that De Wang and Li Shouxin are willing to sell out the nation. Under the protection of the Japanese, they organized the pseudo-Mongolian United Autonomous Government, with De Wang as the chairman, and a pseudo-provincial government, with Li Shouxin as the chairman. In fact, these two are completely puppet agencies. The Japanese side also has a Guisui Public Office, which issues orders, and Li Shouxin and others are obedient. Guisui is like this on the surface, but there are many guerrillas lurking outside the city and suburbs. In fact, only the city and transportation lines are controlled by the Japanese side, and most of the land is still owned by the guerrillas. Not long ago, someone secretly sent a traitor to Yijinhuoluo, wanting to transport the remains of Genghis Khan to Guisui for burial, expressing their sincere help in establishing the pseudo-Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, but it has not been implemented to this day, which shows that their efforts are exhausted and they are at a loss.

President Chiang and his Wife Hosted a Banquet

From 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm on March 5, the review committees continued. Today was the last two days for the review committees to meet. Each group must complete the review by today, so the education administration group and others had to "burn the midnight oil" to discuss. At 8:00 pm that evening, President Chiang and his wife hosted a banquet at the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce. The food was all new life-oriented, simple and nutritious, three dishes and one soup, served in a bowl, plus a soup, and sugar kumquats, candied dates, candied walnuts and oranges. That evening, Madam Chiang wore a black robe and the President wore a military uniform. After the meal, the President stood up amidst thunderous applause and gave a speech.

His speech generally said, "Today, I am hosting a banquet in the New Life Club (i.e. in the Chamber of Commerce) to welcome you all. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the improvement of education at this time. First, education should focus on the transformation of life. In recent years, education in our country has been biased towards the transmission of knowledge, lacking attention to the rectification of the lives of the teachers themselves and the guidance of the actual lives of the taught, resulting in education being unsuitable for the current era and environment. For example, the bedding and luggage carried by general students are all bulky and huge, which is not in line with the life of the times. In the past, we advocated 'eating without seeking satiety, clothing without seeking warmth,' and focused on arduous tempering. Today's youth wear silk and eat meat as commonplace, and even use dietary issues to stir up disturbances. Without discipline and spirit, how can they serve the society? The failure of education is the death of the country. The survival of our country completely depends on the spirit of education in the future and the general youth's life and actions can be thoroughly transformed. The new life I advocate is the life of modern citizens. The six principles of the new life are neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, simplicity, speed, and certainty, all of which are essential elements and standards of life. Educators must teach students to conform to this life.

Second, education must be based on the six arts. The basic education in our country in ancient times was the six arts of etiquette, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic, which are actually the cultivation and skills that modern citizens must possess. This is the education of both civil and military, body and mind. By applying the essence of this kind of education, the taught can be cultivated to become a complete person. Today, with the times different, the content of the six arts may be changed, but it must be recognized that the six arts are indispensable basic subjects for modern national education. The ancients said, 'What is formed in youth is like nature.' If we can promote the development of the National People's foundations according to the six arts, forming a solid and complete foundation of national personality, then the educated people will be able to make effective contributions according to their educational level and professional environment. Finally, the content of the six arts was explained, and Jiang Menglin and Zhang Boling gave answers. In the sound of music, the guests and hosts dispersed happily.

Sixth Day, Fifth General Meeting

The fifth general meeting was held from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm on March 6. Chairman Chen Lifu, Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General were also present. Formalities, reading of the minutes of the fourth general meeting, the chairman reported that President Ma Heng of the Palace Museum was invited to attend the meeting, and invited him to attend the high education review group's temporary motion, please Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Jingnong, Ou Wuhuai, Hu Shuhua and others to review, the secretary reported the congratulatory telegrams from various places, followed by discussion of the proposals,

Passed the Education Funding Bill

The main decisions of the Education Administration Group on education funding are as follows: (1) Each province, city and county should allocate a certain type or several types of tax revenue from the provincial tax, city tax and county tax, all or part of which should be used as the education fund, and the percentage of the total revenue should be determined by the Ministry of Education; (2) If the city and county education fund is too small, the provincial government should subsidize it; (3) If the city and county education fund is surplus, it may be appropriately withdrawn from the provincial education fund according to the needs of the city and county education undertakings; (4) The provincial, city and county education funds should be managed by the education fund management committee; (5) All education funds allocated under the city and county tax revenue items shall be collected, paid and kept by the management committee, and personnel may be dispatched at any time to go directly to the collection agency to check the accounts and urge the payment; (6) The education fund of the municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan shall form a unit of its own. To enrich the scientific instruments and library facilities of secondary schools, the resolution method is as follows: 1. Re-establish standards; 2. Formulate a catalog of secondary school reading materials and a catalog of reference maps; 3. The Ministry of Education raises funds and entrusts the Academia Sinica, etc. to sell them to secondary schools in various provinces and cities at low prices, stipulating that a certain standard must be reached within a limited number of years;

Passed Other Important Proposals

Other resolutions are (1) Please ask the Ministry of Education to set up an agency to study the profound theories of art and music; (2) The Ministry of Education should consider the local transportation, population, economy and culture, etc., and divide the country into several university education districts, each district should have at least one university, and each university must also be responsible for researching social culture and production construction issues in the area; in addition, most of the cases were sent to the Ministry of Education for reference or passed in principle or retained, which were not very important and will not be repeated.

Shencha proposed that Mr. Ju Invited

The afternoon was for the review committee meeting. This was the last day of the review. The temporary proposals were completed by 1:00 to 2:00 pm today. In the evening, Mr. Ju Juesheng hosted a banquet. After the banquet, the Political Department hosted a play, named "Long Live China", performed by movie stars from the China Film Production Factory. The makeup, lighting, scenery, and expressions were all excellent. There were a total of four acts, and the third was a robbery scene. In the dark, the scenery was completely different in less than two minutes. Since our country has a national music school, music has made great progress. Since our country has a national drama school, drama has made rapid progress. Therefore, it is urgent to promote specialized learning in school education.

### Anhui Province Actively Promotes Wartime Education

Formulating Various Wartime Education Implementation Plans

(Tunxi Correspondence) After Mr. Fang Zhi, Director of the Anhui Department of Education, arrived in Tunxi last year, he immediately inspected various secondary schools in southern Anhui, formulated various wartime implementation plans and reform plans. At the beginning of last month, he took them to Lihuang and submitted them to the provincial government for deliberation and implementation. In southern Anhui, in addition to handling the existing schools in accordance with the current plans, wartime unemployed teachers and out-of-school students are registered and given relief, engaging in teaching, and paying special attention to local education work in the occupied areas. Inspectors from various districts are selected and dispatched to work separately. In areas adjacent to the war zone, a mobile education film team is organized, with more than ten members. Led by Inspector Mao Wen, the team carries seven types of anti-Japanese war films printed by the Ministry of Education, including: (1) Resistance War, (2) Boy Scouts in the Resistance War, (3) Boy Scout First Aid Skills, (4) Our Capital, (5) Poison Gas Prevention, (6) History of National Pain, (7) National Products Year.

Each time they arrive in a county, they ask the county party headquarters to send personnel to lead them to various larger villages, and ask the county government to order its subordinate districts and guarantees to assist in participation. In all the places they pass through, publicity conferences are held, with more than a thousand people participating. All of them are deeply moved. It is reported that the team has now arrived in Taiping.

### Xiqing Volleyball League Kicked Off Last Night, Fanggang Jia Lost to Xiqing

Women's Xiqing Defeated Peide, Men's Russian Overseas Chinese Won Against Blue Black

The Xiqing Men's and Women's Volleyball League kicked off last night in the association's gym. The opening game was Women's Xiqing vs. Peide. The first game was very competitive. Xiqing won 15 to 13. In the deciding game, Xiqing took advantage of the victory and was extremely successful. Peide was at a loss. The entire game only scored four points. As a result, Xiqing won again 15 to 4. The first game of Group B, Russian Overseas Chinese B vs. Blue Black, continued to compete. Under a one-sided situation, Blue Black lost two consecutive games 2 to 15 and 5 to 15. In the last game, Fanggang Jia (previously mistakenly written as Fangguang Jia) of Group A and Xiqing took the stage. After the contact, the two sides were evenly matched. Xiqing's Puluokefu scored a point, and Fanggang immediately tied the score. Xiqing exceeded again with 2 to 1. Fanggang captured two points and took the lead with 3 to 2. Xiqing's arrogance was once again high, leading remotely with 11 to 5. Fanggang relied on Guo Bingkun's smash to take effect, scoring two consecutive points, but it was a fleeting moment, and lost the first game 7 to 15. After a break, Xiqing took the lead and took the lead with 7 to 2. Pu Luokefu and Mantolies showed their skills, and Bolton repeatedly used wonderful shots, instantly becoming 13 to 6. Seeing the dangerous situation, Fanggang's generals quickly caught up. Guo Bingkun rose up in anger and repeatedly jumped up to high pressure, killing the enemy. Zheng Weiguo and Guan Jinbiao also tried their best to supply the ball. Fanggang increased six points in a row, forcing the score to 13 all. Who knew that Guo Bingkun's two mistakes at the end led to the second game being lost 13 to 15. As a result, Xiqing defeated Fanggang Jia in two straight games. Tonight, both games are in Group B.

### Japanese Warships Intrude and Fail, Eastern Zhejiang Remains Safe and Sound

Rumors of Landing in Xiaoshan are Untrue, Oujiang and Yongjiang Will Not Be Blockaded

Details of Japanese Warships Bombarding Various Places in Eastern Zhejiang

Recently, due to the intrusion of Japanese warships into eastern Zhejiang, the situation has become slightly tense. Someone has also spread rumors that the Japanese army had landed in a certain important place on the south bank of Qiantang River the other day, causing deep concern among Zhejiang people in Shanghai. Yesterday, the reporter from Xiandai News Agency inquired from various relevant parties and learned that the saying of landing in Qianjiang is completely untrue. Wenzhou, Ningbo, Haimen, and other places are all as peaceful as ever. There is no news of the two mouths of Oujiang and Yongjiang being locked down. Shipping continues as usual. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Landing in Qianjiang is Purely a Rumor

Previously, it was widely rumored in the city that the Japanese army had landed in a certain important place on the south bank of the Qiantang River, causing Zhejiang people in Shanghai to be extremely concerned because it was related to the safety of their hometown. Yesterday, the reporter learned that the cause of the rumor was due to the news reported that "more than 100 Japanese warships left the Yangtze River and sailed south to Hangzhou Bay," which caused some nervous people to speculate. In fact, it was purely someone spreading rumors, with the aim of disrupting people's minds. Yesterday, relevant parties in the city have telegraphed to inquire. It is learned that a small group of Japanese troops landed near the sandbar of Dongzhou, that is, Zhoujiapu, in the Fuchun River, but after being severely attacked by the garrison, they were unable to make progress. As for the Qiantang River, although the Japanese army tried to sneak across and land, they have not succeeded. Therefore, the saying that it had landed in Xiaoshan the other day is completely untrue.

Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou are all as Peaceful as Ever

As for Wenzhou, a few Japanese planes did go to bomb on the 20th. They first dropped many bombs in the suburbs, mostly falling in the fields. Then, in the afternoon, they flew to the urban area to bomb, dropping four bombs near the county government. Dozens of civilian houses were destroyed there, and a bomb also hit the detention center of the county government, killing and injuring more than 20 prisoners. Therefore, the damage was not significant. The shipping industry in the city received a telegram from Wenzhou at 11 am yesterday, saying that the situation was safe and shops were open as usual. Also, a certain shipping company telegraphed Ningbo Haimen yesterday to inquire about the situation, and then received a reply in the afternoon, also saying that it was safe and sound. According to a correspondent from Wenzhou, this morning (21st), a large number of Japanese planes bombed here and dropped bombs in the urban area. Part of the county government's buildings were also destroyed. As for the deaths and injuries of residents, it is not yet clear. The authorities are currently handling the aftermath.

The Two Mouths of Yong and Ou Will Not Be Blockaded

Since Japanese warships have repeatedly harassed various ports in eastern Zhejiang in the past month, the Chinese military authorities have taken strict precautions and built fortifications in various fortresses, and transferred elite troops to stand by, preparing to deal with all emergencies. Regarding the navigable ports, in addition to Haimen, which has been blockaded, Wenzhou and Ningbo are not intended to be blockaded for the time being, because the situation has not reached any serious level. However, after the rumor once spread the other day, Zhejiang people in Shanghai were worried about the blockade of transportation. Yesterday, according to the Xiandai News Agency reporter's inquiry from the shipping industry, the Taiping wheel of Yongjiang had been preparing to fire for several months, not recently. Moreover, the current situation is very stable, and the Zhenhai port has strict defense, making it difficult for Japanese warships to succeed. Therefore, it is expected that the Yong authorities will not implement the blockade unless it is absolutely necessary. As for the Oujiang port, there is also no news of preparing to blockade, but it can be implemented immediately when necessary.

Foreign Merchant Ships are Still Open

Yesterday morning, there was another rumor in the city that the Shanghai-Ningbo route was no longer open, but after the Xiandai News Agency reporter inquired, the above rumor was completely untrue. The Tangsai of the American Huamei Company sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai at 5 pm the other day, and arrived at the port at 10 am yesterday. According to the staff on board, the situation in Ningbo was as usual and there was no change. Moreover, they were surprised by the rumors in Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to still sail to Ningbo at 3 pm today. The Hana wheel of the German Far East Company in Ningbo has sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai at 4 pm yesterday, and will load fish and return directly to Shanghai. The Shantai wheel of the Portuguese Zhengde Company sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai at 9 am yesterday and arrived at the port last night, and is also scheduled to sail to Ningbo this afternoon. The Deping wheel of the Italian Sino-Italian Company is scheduled to sail to Shanghai today and tomorrow. As for the Tanglu of the American business, the Haifu of the German business, the Hailong and other wheels of the Portuguese business on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, are scheduled to sail to Ou one after another tomorrow afternoon. Therefore, shipping is still open and there is no obstacle.

Detailed Account of Japanese Warships Bombarding Eastern Zhejiang

Ningbo Correspondence: Since Zhenhai urban area was bombarded by Japanese warships on the 14th of this month, most of the residents have automatically evacuated. Because the authorities have defended properly, although they are constantly harassed by Japanese warships, the people remaining in Zhenhai are still calm. At about 7 am on the 19th, a patrol ship and three destroyers, and two transport ships sailed from Shanghai and gathered on the sea between Qili Island and Ligang outside Zhenhai Port. At first, there was no abnormal movement. At about 10 am, they suddenly opened fire on the coast and bombed indiscriminately. The garrison troops first calmly dealt with it, and then bravely fired back. The artillery battle lasted until about 1 pm, and then stopped. At about 2 pm, the Japanese warships suddenly opened fire again and harassed, intermittently. The firepower was not as tight as in the morning. Our garrison troops also fought back. By 4 pm, the second artillery battle stopped. Two Japanese warships were hit by shells on the side of the ship and escaped with injuries. The other four ships were still anchored in their original positions. In total, the artillery battle lasted six hours that day, and the Japanese warships fired more than 400 shots, most of which fell on the mountains and beaches of Xiaojiang Qingshi. A corner of the stage in Xiaojiang Palace was destroyed, and two men and two women civilians were injured, all of whom were very minor. A passerby who was selling tin foil ash was killed on Shaxie Ridge, his head and body separated, which was tragic. The houses were slightly damaged. The city and the streets of Jiangnan were not affected. The three warships retreated once in the early morning of the 20th. Unexpectedly, at about 10 am, they drove back to their original positions and continued to open fire on Zhenhai. The garrison troops immediately gave them a head-on blow, and it stopped at about 3 pm. The Japanese warships fired a total of 116 shots, all aimlessly, and the shells all fell on the coastal beaches and the mountains of Xiaojiang Qingshi, with no losses. The Japanese warships knew that it was difficult to succeed because the Chinese army's defense was strict, so they all left at about 5 pm. There is no trace of Japanese warships in the waters of Ningbo.

Also, at about 10 am on the 20th, four small Japanese warships sailed to the Zhapu waters of Hangzhou Bay. At 11 am, they suddenly fired artillery shells at the coast of Linshanwei, which belongs to Yuyao County on the opposite bank, a total of four or five shells. It was indiscriminate firing, and the shells all fell on the beach. We had no losses. The warship then sailed to the northeast.

Also, at about 9 am on the 19th, four Japanese planes were found in Taizhou Bay. They intruded into the airspace of Haimen City from Jiaojiang Estuary, circling and flying several times, dropping eight light bombs. The houses were slightly damaged. However, since Haimen was harassed by Japanese planes and warships, many residents have moved away, so the damage was minimal. The plane flew to the sea to chase the large merchant ships and strafed them with machine guns, injuring one of the tea workers in the ship. At more than 10 am, they escaped overseas. When the Japanese plane bombed Haimen, Yinxian, Zhenhai, Fenghua, Ninghai, Linhai, Huangyan, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang issued alerts to prepare for it. It was lifted after the Japanese plane escaped.

### Annual Meeting of the Harmony Business Association: Strongly Condemns Japanese Monopoly of Commerce

Disregards Interests of Third Countries; Chinese People All Loathe "United Reserve" Banknotes

To Restore Prosperity, Trade Must Be Restored Early

Mainland News reports: The Harmony Business Association, an organization of expatriates from various countries in Shanghai, held its annual meeting yesterday (the 21st). The chairman of the association, Mr. Paulsen, the German manager of the Henry Bawden Shipping Company, gave a detailed report on the obstruction of foreign trade by the Japanese in China this year. Mr. Paulsen first stated that this was an international business association, and therefore it must take a broader view of the situation than a purely national business association. He then described the general situation, saying that although Japan claimed to respect the interests of third countries in China's trade, in reality, it was only trying to increase its own interests, regardless of the interests of third countries. Recently, Tianjin announced that exporters who want to export goods must prove to the customs that they have sold foreign currency equivalent to the value of the exported goods to the "United Reserve Bank" before they can be approved. Otherwise, no kind of goods is

allowed to be exported. Qingdao also implemented this policy in the same way a few months ago. Japan established the "United Reserve Bank" in North China, and although the banknotes it issues nominally rely on the Japanese yen, they actually depend entirely on Chinese exports for support. Nothing could reduce North China's exports to a minimum more than the United Reserve banknotes. The Chinese, in their conscience, loathe this kind of banknote and consider using it as unpatriotic. According to statistics, last year's Chinese customs revenue fell by a huge 100 million yuan. Surprisingly, China is currently in the midst of turmoil, but exports in January of this year increased by 55% compared to the same month last year, and imports also

increased by 40% compared to the same month last year. However, the increase is limited to certain kinds of goods and cannot be a sign of a general recovery in commerce. Although the war now appears to be far away from most of the trading ports, the restrictive regulations continue to be implemented. As far as trade with third countries is concerned, it has stagnated. Judging from the recent declarations made by the leaders of China and Japan, there is little hope of restoring normal trade in the short term. Large quantities of Japanese goods and military supplies are now flowing into North China, Central China, and South China, which has caused discontent among some third countries. One of the most serious aspects of the overall situation is the significant decline in people's purchasing power. If the existing restrictive regulations are not abolished and the people are allowed to be free, there is little hope of improving their financial resources. Within the areas occupied by Japanese

forces, they monopolize products. Their purpose is only (1) to supply the needs of the Japanese army in the war zone, (2) to supply the raw materials needed by Japanese industries in China and Japan, and (3) the surplus products can be exported to Europe and the United States, and the foreign currency obtained from the sales goes into the hands of Japanese-controlled banks. If Chinese and foreign merchants in the Japanese-controlled areas can transport goods to the coastal ports without interference, they can export large quantities of goods to foreign countries. However, because railways and waterways are all under Japanese control, without their permission, no goods can be transported. Since Shanghai and the area south of the Yangtze River are not subject to currency controls, the situation in the ports of North China, where trade is controlled by the "United Reserve Bank," is self-evident. As for the ports still under the

National Government's management, the government not only calculates the foreign currency value of all exports at the official exchange rate but also establishes a trade bureau to sell Chinese products directly to foreign countries to exchange for war supplies. Hankou is now completely isolated. Unless the Yangtze River is fully opened for free trade and can reach the vast inland provinces, Shanghai's trade will continue to be insignificant as it is now. The Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement signed last May allowed the Chinese customs to overcome many of the difficulties it faced. Although the National Government did not receive customs revenue from the areas controlled by the Japanese, it still maintained payments on due customs loans last year, but it announced a suspension of payments in January of this year. Foreign holders of railway bonds are not allowed to exercise the right to inspect and manage their assets. Most of the railways are being used by the Japanese and have resumed commercial traffic. Some railways are doing quite well, with crowded passengers. These railways were built by third countries with outstanding foreign debts, but now they are being operated by the Japanese, and no payments are being made to stockholders and bondholders. News of shipping difficulties in Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao

is frequently heard, especially news of discriminatory regulations to protect Japanese ships and Japanese trade. As far as Shanghai is concerned, attention must be paid to the difficulties caused by the restrictions in the Yangshupu area. Only when the area is opened and people and goods can move freely without restrictions can people regain trust in the area. Because these areas are subject to restrictions and continue to be closed, the Public Concession, including the areas outside the boundary, and the French Concession are overcrowded, and factories are being built in the western district, causing several

serious dangers such as fire and health problems. Industrialists who previously set up factories in these restricted areas will not return to their original sites until normality is restored in these areas. Last year, overseas shipping resumed in Shanghai, but the number of ocean-going ships from various countries sailing to other ports in China has greatly decreased. The failure to dredge the Huangpu River is causing increasing anxiety. Dredging work is imperative. From many perspectives, Shanghai's situation last year was more satisfactory than

expected at the last annual meeting. This is due to the great resilience of the Chinese people. It seems not an exaggeration to say that the Chinese can find ways to trade under any circumstances. As for the future, I feel optimistic, but it must be said that establishing unwanted monopolies and controlling foreign exchange and exports will certainly not promote the restoration of prosperity. The early restoration of trade seems to depend on the full and sincere cooperation of all countries. Unless this is achieved, Shanghai and China's commerce will continue to be shocked and hindered from progress and happiness.

### Yen Devaluation

Tokyo Government is Seriously Considering Aims to Keep Yen Close to the Pound Sterling

Mainland News reports: According to reliable sources, the Tokyo government is currently seriously considering the formal devaluation of the yen in the near future. After the current session of the Japanese Diet closes in a few weeks, the Hiranuma Cabinet will immediately decide whether to devalue the yen as early as this spring. In recent weeks, Japanese government officials have been more strongly advocating the devaluation of the yen than before. They advised the authorities to continue to keep the yen close to the pound sterling, but want the yen to be lowered by 30% from the current one shilling and two pence without leaving the pound sterling. The important argument put forward by those who advocate the devaluation of the yen is that this move can drastically reduce the level of Japanese foreign exchange prices, making Japanese exports cheaper, solve the price problems related to controlled exports in North China, and allow the Bank of Japan to increase the value of the yen currency reserves.

### Japanese Set New Traffic Rules: Municipal Council Protests

Copies Sent to the Consular Body

Regarding the traffic rules promulgated by the Japanese Marine Corps north of the Suzhou Creek, it is reported that the Municipal Council has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities. Copies of the protest have been sent to the Consular Body. The Council's grounds are that the enforcement of traffic rules within the Public Concession is the responsibility of the police force, and other agencies have no right to restrict it.

### Municipal Council Adds Donations: Real Estate Industry Asks for Reversal of Decision

Refugees Come to Shanghai, Creating Temporary Prosperity; The Bureau Should Consider Its Income and Expenditure and Reconsider

The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: Sirs, we have recently learned that the Bureau intends to increase the general donation from 16% to 18% and the land donation from 8 per thousand to 10 per thousand, starting from October 1, 1939. The Bureau has just increased both the general and land donations last year. It has not been long since then, and to reconsider increasing the donations will place an unbearable burden on our citizens. It does not seem appropriate in terms of reason and sentiment. Moreover, the large population and prosperity of Shanghai are due to the temporary refuge of refugees from the generally occupied areas, not the result of industrial development. It is a special situation and cannot be called prosperity. In addition, all the empty houses in the city owned by various owners are now rented out, and the rent for new houses is twice that of old houses. Therefore, the total donation received by the Bureau is more than ever before. The Bureau should consider its income and expenditure. The proposed increase in donations should not be measured by unilateral income. Please reconsider and reverse the decision. We sincerely hope for this. Respectfully to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.

### Movement of British and French Military Officers

The North China Daily News reports: Lieutenant Colonel Acton, the outgoing commander of the 2nd Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, left for Hong Kong by the Taiyuan ship yesterday (the 21st) afternoon and then returned to the United Kingdom. Mr. Acton left the Great Western Road barracks before noon yesterday and arrived at the Bund of the French Concession by car. The British Consul, the commanders of the military forces of the United States, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, and British military officers and soldiers all came to see him off. After saying goodbye to them one by one, Mr. Acton left Shanghai on the ship to the sound of drums and music played by the British army. It is reported that after Mr. Acton arrives in Hong Kong, he will stay for three days and then return to the country on the troop transport ship HMS Lancashire.

The North China Daily News reports: Lieutenant Colonel Granié, the new commander of the French army stationed in Shanghai, will arrive in port today (the 22nd) on the French mail ship Chen Nusha. He is scheduled to take office formally on the 29th of this month. The current commander, Colonel Berger, will leave Shanghai on the 30th of this month for a vacation in Komatsu, Japan. After returning to Shanghai, he will depart for home on the 25th of next month.

### Japanese Openly Admit that Puppet "Regime" is Anti-British

Claiming that the British Attitude Favors the National Government, the Two Puppet "Regimes" are Anti-British

The North China Daily News reports: A Japanese official received reporters from various newspapers last night (the 21st). A certain American reporter asked whether the Japanese authorities had taken any steps to curb anti-British activities in the areas under their control. The spokesperson replied that if all actions of the British government were contrary to the interests of the Japanese authorities and the "new government," then it was a matter of course that the general sentiment against such actions would be expressed in the press. A certain questioner specifically mentioned the newly organized "Anti-British Joint Association" in Nanjing and asked whether the Japanese side was taking any measures to deal with this group. The spokesperson replied that if there was such a move in Nanjing, he must have heard of it. Asked whether Nanjing would organize an anti-American joint association, given that the United States had loaned China US$25 million, the spokesperson replied that this was a matter of ideal and could not be answered. Then, the Japanese military spokesperson expressed his opinion that

the history of Sino-British relations, especially certain trends in the British government's recent actions, has been the target of criticism by the Chinese themselves. A certain reporter asked who among the Chinese had criticized British actions. The spokesperson replied that the new regime would declare its disapproval. Asked whether the Japanese authorities hoped to end the anti-Japanese sentiments in the English newspapers, the spokesperson said that just by reading the English newspapers here, it could be seen whether they were anti-Japanese. He added that the Japanese authorities certainly did not welcome

such sentiments in the English newspapers. Asked what legal basis they had to insist that the British government was engaged in activities opposing the unrecognized new regime in Nanjing, the spokesperson replied that there were two regimes in China, one was the Chongqing government and the other was the newly established groups in Beiping and Nanjing. If the British attitude was in favor of the Chongqing government, then it was natural that anti-British sentiments would arise in Beiping and Nanjing.

### Japanese and Puppets Attempt to Seize Land Bureau Files; Municipal Council Firmly Refuses

Ignoring Any Strong Protests

After the National Army withdrew from Greater Shanghai, the political center of the city moved inward. All large and small agencies moved to the rear with the army. However, the Shanghai Land Bureau believed that all the files of the bureau were of great importance to the land administration of Shanghai. Therefore, before the withdrawal, it carefully entrusted the Public Concession Municipal Council to keep all important files and documents of the bureau to avoid loss. It has been more than a year since then. Recently, after Fan Aichun, the puppet "Director of the Land Bureau," took office, on the pretext that there were no files at all and no official business could be conducted, the Japanese military, together with the Japanese Consul General, approached the Municipal Council and forced the transfer of all the files and documents of the former Land Bureau to the puppet "Land Bureau" for management. However, after several negotiations, the Municipal Council sternly refused. According to the Municipal Council's opinion, these files could not be easily transferred to a third party without the consent of the Chongqing government. Moreover, the Consular Body has never recognized the organization of the puppet "Municipal Government." Therefore, no matter how strong their protests are, the Municipal Council will resolutely ignore them.

### Ministry of Communications Maintains Credit: Railway Materials Paid as Scheduled

Mr. Zhang Jia'ao Expresses Concern for International Credit; Payments Will Not Be Stopped Unless the Entire Railway is Occupied

The Chinese government's determination and efforts to protect the interests of creditors have long been proven by facts. Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Communications, also stated that the principal and interest of foreign debts of various railways under the management of the Ministry will not be stopped unless the entire railway is occupied, in order to protect international credit. Therefore, after March 1938, foreign debts and materials from foreign merchants for various railways were paid as usual. The investigation is as follows:

Railway Foreign Debts

(1) Tianjin-Pukou British-German Original Continued Loan: The interest and management fees for the British part of the original loan due in April and May, totaling £1,234-0-4, were pre-funded on a monthly basis and paid in full when due. (2) Longhai Railway Loan: Interest and management fees due in July totaled £85,978-8-2, B$2,761,747.15, H$631,234.15, F$426,062.50, and CN$17,956.78, plus a subsidy of CN$8,000. Funds were pre-funded on a monthly basis and paid in full as scheduled. (3) Bianluo Railway Loan: Interest and management fees due in July totaled F$588,968.75, which was paid in full when due. (4) Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Loan: Principal, interest, and management fees due in June totaled £32,744-3-2, which was paid in full as scheduled. (5) Ningxiang Railway Advance: Principal and interest of CN$25,000 each due in April and July, and interest of CN$11,000 due in April were paid as scheduled.

Foreign Merchant Materials

(1) Pinghan Road Foreign Merchant Materials: Approximately £950 and CN$100,000 per month were allocated by the Ministry of Communications and paid up to May 1938. Continued allocations are being made thereafter. (2) Tianjin-Pukou Road Foreign Merchant Materials: Over CN$53,000 per month was paid by the Ministry of Communications up to April. In May, due to the entire line being occupied, creditors were notified to temporarily suspend payments. (3) Longhai Road Belgian Company Materials: CN$2,000 per month was allocated by the Ministry of Communications and paid up to May 1938. Continued allocations are being made thereafter. (4) Five batches of promissory notes from the Paris Electrical Plant for road construction materials were used to purchase materials needed for the western section of the Longhai Road project. The original terms were extended, and £21,000 was paid each month in January, April, July, and October. All matured notes have been paid.

### Fierce Battle at Tianmashan, Songjiang: Japanese Army Surrounded After Attempting Flanking Maneuver

The Situation in Gaoqiao, Pudong, Becomes Tense

Martial Law Imposed by Japanese Army in Western Shanghai

Tianmashan is located near Songjiang on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and has a strategic location. After the National Army withdrew to the west, the area became a major base for guerrillas. In order to completely eliminate them, the Japanese have launched several attacks, but have been defeated by the guerrillas each time. In the drizzling rain of the morning before yesterday (the 20th), the Japanese army mobilized troops and advanced towards Tianmashan. The advance guard of the guerrillas discovered them, fired a shot to stop the advance, and urgently reported to the headquarters. Taking advantage of their high position, they launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army. Because of the large number of casualties, the Japanese army avoided a direct sacrifice and sent a team to flank our rear. However, they were often discovered by the guards at the foot of the mountain, who were scattered in the jungle. When the Japanese army arrived, the guerrillas rushed out and surrounded the Japanese army. Although the Japanese army tried desperately to break through the encirclement, they were still trapped in the center. When the Japanese army on the front heard the alarm, they withdrew and reinforced the rear. The fierce battle is still in progress, and it will not be difficult to wipe out the surrounded Japanese army.

Japanese Army Builds Small Fort in Gaoqiao

A small squad of the Japanese army, with about 30 soldiers, is stationed on the south bank of Tiandengtou in Gaoqiao, Pudong. Next to the residence, there is a large circle of sandbags for defense. Because the Huajun guerrilla team in Nanchuan has been active recently, and there have been sightings in Gaoqiao, the garrison has strengthened its defenses. In addition to imposing martial law earlier and searching passing travelers, yesterday they built a circular small fort on the opposite bank of the Xiangjihe wheel port pier (that is, next to the old sandbag circle). It was built with large wall bricks collected from the people and is more than ten feet high, with three gunports in the middle. Although this platform cannot withstand fierce artillery fire, it is enough to show the severity of the situation in Pudong. It is also reported that the guerrillas of Yu Taosheng's unit suddenly attacked the Japanese army there the night before last (the 20th). The two sides fought fiercely for several hours. The Japanese army was defeated and retreated, leaving corpses everywhere.

Japanese Soldier's Car Derails on Shangchuan Road

The Japanese army has been frequently transporting on the Shangchuan Railway in Pudong for days. The morning before yesterday, four Japanese soldier's cars were traveling to Chuansha and derailed in the middle of the journey. All four cars completely overturned, causing heavy casualties.

The Situation of Building Roads Beyond the Boundary is Tense

The Japanese side announced martial law in the area of the Shanghai West Outside Road. Sandbags, barbed wire, and other obstacles were placed at all important passes, and Japanese military police assisted the puppet police in guarding the area. The situation is tense, and the residents are uneasy, as if a war is about to break out. The number of citizens moving to the concession is bound to increase daily.

### Exposing the Japanese Side's Recent Conspiracy

Guerrilla Team Posts Notices

Modern Society reports: The day before yesterday, Chinese guerrillas posted notices and distributed leaflets in the suburbs of western Shanghai, exposing the enemy's recent conspiracy and informing the people to be vigilant and not be fooled. The general idea is that the enemy has recently bought a large number of traitors, also in the name of patriotic groups, in an attempt to confuse the public. On the one hand, they are also instigating criminals to carry out intense work in the British and French concession areas, so that the enemy can take this opportunity to make arbitrary demands, oppress the concession authorities, and do whatever they want. Their intention is to shift the blame to their neighbors and use a knife to kill people. Therefore, students and youths are advised to carefully consider the details and not act rashly, lest they be used by the enemy.

### Siam Increases Entry and Residence Fees

Increased from 100 Baht to 300 Baht

At the Same Time, People Suffering from Conjunctivitis Are Not Allowed to Enter

Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government Chuan Ling Jia Yu No. 1669: It is hereby informed that, according to reports from overseas Chinese in Siam, the Siamese government announced on October 14, through Assistant Minister of the Interior Luan Yalun, that the new entry and residence fee for foreigners has been increased from 100 Baht to 300 Baht (approximately equivalent to more than 500 yuan in national currency), effective immediately. However, this notice was not known to the overseas Chinese until the Siamese Political Gazette was published on the 17th of the same month. On October 20, hundreds of passengers aboard the Xialinan and Zhangjiakou ships, which arrived in Siam from Shantou, were all handled in accordance with the new regulations without any flexibility. Therefore, the number of those who were unable to pay the increased residence fee and were sent back by the Siamese government was quite large. In the future, Chinese people coming to Siam must prepare sufficient funds to avoid a futile trip. Moreover, the Siamese government has repeatedly issued harsh regulations, and it is not easy for us to find jobs. It is more secure to use the money spent on coming south to make a living in the country. It was also announced on September 19 that people suffering from conjunctivitis were not allowed to enter, etc. The Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce has submitted a report with the same information. Based on this, in addition to separate instructions, it is hereby ordered that you be informed and that overseas Chinese going to Siam for export be informed.

### A Young Man Shot Dead at the Caojiadu Triangle Field Yesterday Morning

Three shots in the body and twelve bullets recovered. It is said that the deceased impersonated a guerrilla and was shot.

At 9:20 am yesterday, a male corpse was found shot dead in the mixed bathhouse lane near the fire brigade at the Caojiadu Triangle Field in West Shanghai. He had one bullet in his head and two in his body. He was immediately transported to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. The man was about twenty years old, wearing blue cloth blacksmith-style work clothes, a black felt hat, and yellow leather shoes. Judging from his clothing, he did not seem to be from the upper class. Twelve bullets for a box cannon were found near the body. It is reported that the killed man, along with two accomplices, specialized in impersonating Chinese guerrillas in the Caojiadu area of ​​West Shanghai, extorting taxes from passing vehicles. Businessmen did not know the truth and were mostly deceived. Yesterday morning, when the deceased and two other accomplices were repeating the same trick, three members of the Chinese Youth Iron Blood Corps passed by, recognized their deception, and the other two took the opportunity to escape. At that time, the deceased even tried to draw his gun to resist, resulting in being shot dead by the Iron Blood Corps members. It is understood that the incident occurred entirely within the Japanese defense zone, so the above rumor is reliable, but it has not yet been confirmed.

### Petty Traitor Run Over and Killed by a Car

Qiu Asan, a native of Jiangbei, thirty-eight years old, living at No. 67, Renxin Lane, Feihong Road, Hongkou, was a rogue. Since the Chinese army withdrew to the west, he colluded with certain ronin, specializing in doing evil and oppressing the people in the Hongkou area. At around 7:00 am yesterday, he walked out of his house, intending to go to the New Asia Hotel, but when he walked to the intersection of Tiantong Road and Zha Pu Road, he encountered a chartered truck No. 16310 speeding by. They were unable to give way to each other in time. Qiu Asan was knocked down by the truck, and the wheels ran over his body. He immediately vomited blood, fainted, and was on the verge of death. The incident was spotted by Indian constable No. 262, who immediately detained the vehicle and sent Qiu Asan to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, due to his serious injuries, he died shortly thereafter. After the event, the detectives and constables searched the deceased and discovered that he had a "Anti-Communist League badge" buttoned in his underwear, and more than ten blank membership application forms. From this, it was learned that Qiu was a traitor, specializing in luring ignorant people into the tiger's den. Yesterday morning, when he was passing Zha Pu Road, he was just about to go to his fake "office" when he was unexpectedly run over and killed by a truck.

### Incompetent Doctor Sentenced for Causing Death by Illegal Abortion

Zhu Wenfang sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment. The civil lawsuit will be heard separately.

Liu Xu, a woman from Wuxi (33 years old), residing at No. 94, Dagu Road, whose husband, Liu Qingxiang, works at the Public Works Department's Health Office, had five children, both boys and girls. Her husband's monthly income was not enough to cover household expenses, and Liu Xu felt troubled by having too many children. Recently, she became pregnant again, two months along. At the beginning of this month, she secretly went to the obstetrics hospital opened by Zhu Wenfang, a woman from Hubei, at No. 18, Lane 713, Gordon Road, and agreed to have the fetus in her womb aborted for 15 yuan. Zhu Wenfang gave her a bottle of pills to take home and swallow, and a piece of gauze to insert into her vagina, so that the fetus could be aborted immediately. By 4:30 pm on the 6th, she had severe abdominal pain, bleeding from her lower body, and was mentally confused. Her husband, Liu Qingxiang, learned of the situation and hired a car to rush his wife to the Sino-German Hospital on Avenue Foch for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at about 1:00 am the next morning. He reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Xia Shutang to arrest Zhu at her address, along with a bottle of pills, and sent her to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi visited the Third Criminal Court for investigation. Dr. Yu of the Sino-German Hospital testified that when Liu Xu came to our hospital for treatment, she was already mentally confused and unable to speak. After questioning, it was learned that she had suffered injuries from an abortion, excessive bleeding from her lower body, and the rotten placenta in her uterus was urgently removed, but it was ineffective. She died after several hours. When questioned, the defendant claimed that she had been introduced by a Chinese medicine doctor surnamed Wu and had taken Chinese medicine. The rest of her testimony was evasive. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted her for abortion, requesting severe punishment. Liu Qingxiang also hired a lawyer to bring a civil lawsuit, demanding compensation for funeral expenses and raising his children, totaling 3,552 yuan and 8 cents. After the interrogation, Judge Jiang ruled that Zhu Wenfang, with the intention of making a profit, accepted the entrustment of a pregnant woman to cause her to have an abortion, thereby causing the woman's death, and sentenced her to one year and six months of imprisonment. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court, and a bottle of aloe vera and iron pills was confiscated.

### Japanese Man Mukai Stabbed, No Police Report Made Afterwards

Mukai went upstairs to change clothes even after being injured. Yunfei Taxi drivers refused to go to Hongkou.

The "North China Daily News" reported that Mukai, a Japanese man, 58 years old, runs a clothing shop at No. 250, Jing'an Temple Road, next to the Grand Theater, was stabbed yesterday (31st) morning at 11:00 am. He is now lying in Fumin Hospital. Although the doctor claimed last night that his life could be saved, the injuries were very serious. After Mukai was stabbed, a Yunfei taxi arrived at his shop, but the taxi driver refused to take him to Fumin Hospital, causing a dispute. A nearby Western constable noticed their argument and immediately discovered that Mukai had been stabbed with a knife. He then summoned an ambulance and sent him to the Japanese hospital. According to reporters, Mukai told the Western constable that around 11:00 am, two Chinese men entered his shop, took out a carpenter's square knife, which was not very sharp, and stabbed him in the left breast, one inch to the left. The two criminals left the weapon behind and fled without taking anything. A few minutes later, detectives from the Xinzha Police Station arrived at the shop and found the kimono that Mukai was wearing when he was stabbed, left in the shop. Mukai must have gone to the second floor to change into clean clothes before leaving the shop. Furthermore, it was heard that Mukai did not report to the police, so the patrolman in front of the shop only learned of the murder when he was arguing with the taxi driver. From this, it can be seen that Mukai, although suffering from a wound as deep as six inches and in great pain, could still force himself to remain calm and go to the small room upstairs to change clothes, so that his clothes would not be stained with blood and attract attention. Then he slowly walked out of the shop to wait for a car, intending to go to the hospital. It was heard that Mukai was not alone in the shop before leaving. It is believed that there was still a certain Japanese woman inside after he was stabbed. The Japanese authorities are now also investigating this case. It was learned late yesterday that the Japanese authorities had learned of the location of the Japanese woman and had confirmed Mukai's claim that two Chinese men had committed the assault. According to the person who answered the phone at Yunfei Taxi, the person who hired the car was a Japanese, but it could not be determined whether it was a man or a woman. Furthermore, it was learned that people in neighboring shops did not hear any movement. It was not until the patrolman arrived that they learned of the incident. According to a person from a knife shop set up by a certain Chinese person near the scene of the crime, about a week ago, a Chinese person bought a knife, which was indeed the same as the knife left behind by the murderer. However, the person in the knife shop spoke vaguely about the appearance of the person who bought the murder weapon, only saying that the person who bought the knife also bought a carpenter's pencil. It is heard that Mukai used to run an antique business 25 years ago, accumulated a lot of wealth, and then gradually failed. He opened this shop many years ago, returned to Japan during the Shanghai war, and returned to Shanghai at the beginning of last year. It is understood that Mukai has never engaged in political activities. Before 2:00 pm yesterday, police and military police from the Japanese Consulate also arrived at the scene and began investigating. Detectives from the General Patrol Room and the Xinzha Police Station are now investigating this case.

### Second Special District Prison Evacuates Prisoners

Strict implementation of parole and bail, bidding for 600 piculs of rice for prisoners

The Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Prison at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Massenet, French Concession, originally had 900 prison cells for prisoners, but now the number of prisoners held is more than 2,000, more than double the quota. In order to unclog the prison, the prison authorities have strictly implemented parole and bail measures. However, the number of criminals sentenced by the Second Special Court every day and sent to prison is more than the number of prisoners released from prison. The prison authorities are discussing solutions to the increasing number of prisoners. It is also learned that the prison needs 600 piculs of rice for prisoners next month, and the prison grain committee has resolved to invite merchants to bid for rice samples, using domestic Xian or second-grade white Xian rice as the standard. The public bidding is scheduled to be held at the prison at 3:00 pm on the 30th of this month, and the bids will be opened immediately.

### Meiwen Silk Factory Labor Dispute Resolved

All workers return to the factory to resume work, wages increase by about 9 percent

More than 300 workers at the Meiwen Silk Factory on Xiaoshadu Road went on strike on the 1st of this month because the factory forced them to fill out guarantee forms, causing opposition from the workers. The workers, due to difficult living conditions, made six demands, including improving their living conditions. Negotiations failed, leading to the strike. It is now learned that after several negotiations between labor and management, wages have increased by an average of 9 percent, the guarantee form has also been revised, and sanitation facilities have also been promised to be improved. All workers, in consideration of the close cooperation between labor and management during the national crisis, gave up the demand to "restore pre-war wages." The factory also agreed to increase wages again in the future and is willing to cooperate closely with the workers. All workers are satisfied and have returned to the factory to resume work on the 19th of this month, and a labor-management dispute has been resolved.

### Siblings Face Each Other in Court, Younger Brother Repents in Court

Willing to return the misappropriated goods

Weng Boliang, a native of Chaoyang, Guangdong, used to run the Zhonghua Drawnwork Company on Broadway, Hongkou, engaged in lace business. In July of the year before last, Boliang left Shanghai to visit his parents in Shantou, and entrusted the shop's affairs to his younger brother Hanting (also known as Xishou) for management. Not long after, the Shanghai war broke out. The shop was located in the Japanese-controlled area, so after closing down, the lace goods worth 20,000 yuan were transported by Hanting and stored at No. 20, Gengtong Village, Weihaiwei Road. Last winter, Boliang returned to Shanghai from Shantou and did not intend to resume business. He began to liquidate the company, deciding to use the stored goods to offset the debts. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of this month, Hanting suddenly seized the key to the storage room from his nephew Kezheng when he opened the door of the storage room, and has since occupied the goods. Boliang repeatedly argued with him, but to no avail. The dispute led to litigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special District Local Court summoned both the plaintiff and the defendant for investigation. Because the plaintiff, Weng Boliang, could only speak his native dialect and was difficult to understand, his lawyer, Cai Xiaobai, in addition to stating the intention of the lawsuit, also explained the facts of the dispute, saying that the plaintiff's parents were proletarians, and the defendant and his brothers were raised by their elder brother. All the current property was created solely by the plaintiff, so the shop was named a company, but it was actually opened solely by the plaintiff. Regarding this point, it can be investigated with the Lace Industry Association, and it will not be difficult to understand. Now that the defendant has detained the stored goods without authorization, so that the plaintiff cannot repay the debts, he has committed the crime of embezzlement. Weng Boliang further stated that his brothers originally lived in Gengtong Village, and he only recently moved to No. 11, Datong Lane, Baker Road, because his ancestors had no property, so the brothers had no property to divide, and they still lived together. But the defendant, Weng Hanting, admitted that he was raised to adulthood by his elder brother and that the company was opened solely by his elder brother. He claimed that the company was jointly owned by his four brothers. After he obtained the key to the storage room, he handed the goods over to his younger brother for safekeeping. Judge Zhan reviewed the confession and examined the draft of the letter of repentance submitted by the plaintiff to the defendant for reconciliation. He then persuaded both parties to resolve the matter peacefully, saying that regarding the disputed property, whether it is jointly owned or solely owned, you should know before conducting the investigation, and if it is solely owned by the self-plaintiff and the defendant wants to occupy it, ask the defendant, can you not feel ashamed in the quiet night? Moreover, since you are brothers, if the younger brother has committed a fault, it is not a disgrace to beg forgiveness from the elder brother. Why be stingy and not write this letter of repentance? Upon hearing this, Hanting immediately expressed that in addition to being willing to hand over the stored goods, he also apologized to his brother verbally in court, but he did not want the incident to be put in writing. The court also agreed with his words and again persuaded the plaintiff to resolve the matter peacefully. He ordered both the plaintiff and the defendant to leave and resolve the matter peacefully, and wait for the filing of the case on the 28th of this month for questioning and verification.

### Extortionists Zhang Guozhen, etc., Each Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment

Zhenfeng Copper Factory at No. 105, Binlang Road, and the stack at No. 4, Lane 318, Avenue d'Esmée, owed money to the Bank of China due to debt relations. The stack was usually stationed by Kong Shangang, an employee of the Bank of China, to monitor everything. Recently, Kong received several threatening letters demanding money signed "Second Regiment of the Central People's Self-Defense Army Political Training Department", and reported to the police. The suspects Zhang Guozhen and Wan Xiaozhang were arrested in West Shanghai and sent to the First Special Court, prosecuted for extortion. They were once interrogated, and the defendants admitted to writing the threatening letters without denying it. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan visited the Second Criminal Court and ordered the two defendants to be brought to the court. After a brief questioning, he announced the conclusion of the trial and sentenced Zhang Guozhen and Wan Xiaozhang to one year of imprisonment each for using extortion methods, writing letters, and attempting to induce others to hand over property.

### Fine for Trademark Infringement

And compensate for losses of one hundred yuan

The Beauty brand and Meilian brand stain removal powder produced by Meiya Industrial Society at No. 1423, Avenue Edward VII, had been registered with the Trademark Bureau. Recently, Gu Laixing of Xieji Industrial Society at the end of Seymour Road imitated the Beauty brand trademark pattern and manufactured Hongmei brand stain removal powder, selling it on the market. Meiya Industrial Society believed that it hindered its business and filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Gu Laixing for counterfeiting the registered trademark. The first instance ruled the defendant not guilty. Meiya Industrial Society then appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, arguing in detail that the original judgment's determination of the differences in the women's decorations and explanatory fonts on the trademarks of both parties, and the determination that the trademarks were not similar, was inappropriate. The case was now declared by the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday to cancel the original judgment. Gu Laixing was sentenced to a fine of 20 yuan for intending to defraud by counterfeiting the registered trademark of others, and the civil lawsuit portion should compensate the plaintiff for losses of 100 yuan, in order to deter others from following suit.

### Various Shops in Yimiao Market Form a Commercial Association

### Chen Tingsheng Murder Case: Adulterer Confesses Unreservedly

Tao Boqing and Adulterous Woman Wang Guizhen Conspired

Four Murderers Are at Large, Awaiting Strict Apprehension and Prosecution

Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Sanzi, a native of Zhenjiang and owner of the Huasheng Paper Mill at 39 Haige Lane, Haige Road, French Concession, was murdered on the morning of the 20th. His mistress, Wang Guizhen, incited another lover, Tao Boqing, and four accomplices, to kill him with a pistol and kitchen knife. After the incident, the French police were notified and took the body to the coroner's office for examination. Based on the testimony of the concubine Cao Ali, the deceased's mistress, Wang Guizhen (34 years old, French national) and her adulterer, Tao Boqing (33 years old, Shanghai native, nicknamed "Baldy" Boqing), were detained for investigation. Details have already been reported. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the French police escorted the two suspects, Tao Boqing and Wang Guizhen, to the Second Special Court, where Judge Liao Yuan presided over the criminal court for interrogation. Lawyer Fei Xizhen from the French Concession Administration stated that the police department had completed the investigation of the murder case and requested that the defendants be detained pending further investigation and prosecution. Subsequently, the investigating officer reported the process of arresting the two defendants after the incident. Furthermore, the deceased's concubine, Cao Ali, and the deceased's brother, Chen Futing, recounted the circumstances of the deceased's murder and requested justice. When questioned, Tao Boqing confessed to having an affair with Wang Guizhen and that Wang had discussed with him the idea of paying 400 yuan to kill the deceased. Wang first paid 100 yuan to buy "equipment" (i.e., a pistol), and then he instructed the four fugitives, Xing Ali, Jin Yu-fa, Cao Jinfa, and Wang Liansheng, to carry out the murder. When questioned, Wang Guizhen also admitted to the plan, stating that they had first discussed it in a hotel and that she had paid 100 yuan to buy equipment. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered a postponement to April 10 for further investigation and questioning. The defendants were remanded in custody. The four fugitive murderers are currently being strictly pursued by the police, who are determined to apprehend them and bring them to justice.

Clothing, Food, Housing, Transportation

### Walking

— Yongjian

Many people spend their days confined to small rooms, buried in their desks, never leaving their homes. This is very detrimental to their precious bodies. To strengthen our bodies, in addition to paying attention to health through clothing, food, and housing, walking more is also an important part of it. Because walking not only allows our surrounding air to be constantly exchanged, and the scenery around us to be constantly changing, but also corrects the various stiff and unnatural postures of our bodies during movement. Furthermore, it can make the muscles of the whole body undergo a balanced exercise and obtain: (1) It can help promote our digestive ability and the activity of internal organs; (2) It can promote blood circulation and increase lung vitality; (3) It can make our blood constantly absorb fresh oxygen and become clean; (4) It can make our muscles get a good night's sleep after proper labor and fatigue.

The maintenance of health depends on the balanced development of various parts of the body. After the balance of the body is achieved, the balance of the mind is also easily achieved. The cause of people's diseases is the unbalanced development of various parts of the body - that is, a certain place has a weakness. Therefore, walking more and keeping the body and mind constantly active is indeed the best prescription for warding off disease.

Various equipment or ball sports are still aristocratic and not enjoyed by the general public before physical education becomes widespread. However, walking more in normal times is not difficult. The author's physique has always been weak, but for the past six months, I have made a resolution that I will always use my feet instead of taking a car, except for unavoidable things. As a result, my body has indeed become much healthier recently than before. If you don't believe it, please feel free to try it.

### French Clothing Prohibition Laws

— Li Shaonian

In the eighteenth century, French merchants gradually became wealthy through business, and their material enjoyment almost caught up with the aristocracy. Whatever the aristocrats could enjoy, the merchants could also enjoy. As a result, many merchants bought beautiful clothes and decorations for themselves and their wives that were the same as those of the aristocrats. The aristocrats were very jealous when they saw this, and even the King of France felt unfair. Therefore, the King of France passed a law prohibiting merchants and their wives from wearing gorgeous clothes, expensive decorations, and four-wheeled carriages. It also prohibited aristocrats from making new clothes and using expensive materials. The law is recorded below:

1. Merchants and merchants' wives are not allowed to wear gray squirrel and sable fur.

2. Merchants' wives are not allowed to use gold and jewels as decorations.

3. Merchants and merchants' wives are not allowed to ride in four-wheeled carriages.

After the law was passed, the King also stipulated the following prohibitions for the nobles: Because the King was not only jealous of the merchants, but also jealous of them! The King said:

"You and your wives are not allowed to make more than four new sets of clothes in a year." He also said:

"You are not allowed to use materials worth more than 25 Sa per yard for the clothes you wear."

This kind of law is very interesting in our eyes. Layer upon layer of jealousy, and finally the King won. But people did not obey his orders, especially women, who still asked their husbands to tailor the clothes they liked to wear.

### Garden Arrangement Method

— Wang Zhihan

In addition to clothing, food, housing, and transportation, gardens, which are dedicated to sightseeing and rest, are also necessary living conditions. However, the word "garden" is very difficult to achieve. It requires a suitable location, architectural resources, and the owner must also have an elegant confidence. Only when all three items are complete can it be established. What is even more difficult is that it requires a person with superior vision, a classic taste, and an artistic genius to design and arrange it. Otherwise, pavilions, terraces, flowers, trees, streams, valleys, forests, and hills will often become chaotic. It is either filled with a market atmosphere or reveals a rich and noble atmosphere, which makes people feel vulgar and disgusting and cannot arouse beauty. That is, although there is such a garden, it is as if there is none.

Arranging a large-scale garden is like a painter painting. You must first examine the situation and draw up a draft, and then act according to the plan. Generally, it is nothing more than the coexistence of virtual and real, the alternation of thick and light, it is advisable to be winding rather than straight, it is advisable to be hidden rather than exposed, and it is advisable to be dangerous rather than flat, in order to attract people to enter. The author once wrote a formula for arranging gardens: "The environment should not be cramped, the momentum should be accumulated, the mountains should not be bald, the water should be winding, plant more trees, build fewer houses, the roads should be hidden, the music should be intermittent, chrysanthemums by the fence, bamboo outside the window, cypresses by the wall, wheat outside the door, build accordingly, and it will not be vulgar." This refers to large-scale gardens. As for small gardens, they cannot be done this way. There is also a song formula: "Trees should be old, flowers should be few, roads should be small, stones should be ingenious, do not drive away crows, be careful to cut grass, short fences around, meandering corridors, secluded and elegant, naturally good." Small structures are different from large-scale ones. Large-scale places are open and can be done as you please; small structures have limited space, and the method of arrangement is only to pay attention to sparseness and leisure. Flowers, grasses, trees, and plants can only be slightly decorated. It is important to avoid poverty. Otherwise, the small terrain will be full of plants and piled up in a mess, like a flower shop. What is the fun in that?

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The editor informed me that in order to publish four special pages of "clothing," "food," "housing," and "transportation," I would have to rest except for "food," so my economic menu was missing in the previous two issues, like a "pen is sealed and all is well." If the readers really followed my menu every day, wouldn't that make you "seal your mouths and all is well" from hunger and serve the public? Haha! From this week on, I will continue to serve you as usual. Taking advantage of the season when the weather is not yet very warm, I would like to invite you to eat some fermented foods, because fermented foods easily spoil when it is hot. Now, in early spring, they will not spoil. I remember when I traveled to Wuxi the year before last, I ate a good dish called fermented pork belly, which is made by braising fragrant fermented rice and slices of pork together. It was very delicious to eat. After I came back, I tried to make it in the same way, and it actually worked. In late winter and early spring, I always eat it once or twice a week. Before braising, it is best to first cook the meat until it is crispy, briefly fry it in hot oil to make fried pork belly, and after slightly soaking it in water, start putting the fragrant fermented rice and vegetable hearts at the bottom, and then start braising it in a pot. If you think the look of the fermented rice seems a little unclean, then you can just use fermented rice juice, but the fragrance will be a little worse.

Monday

Fermented pork belly with vegetable hearts, stir-fried Tang fish, bamboo shoots mixed with malan heads, stir-fried small vegetable sprouts

Tuesday

Curry beef, scrambled eggs with leek sprouts, pickled mustard tuber and tofu, braised radish

Friday

Stir-fried sliced pork with cauliflower, sweet and sour yellow croaker, pickled mustard tuber with broad bean sand, stir-fried green vegetables with dried bean curd sheets

### How to Prevent Fires (Part 2)

— Xin Liang

(Continued from "Living" section)

In the attic: (1) Clothes, books, and unused furniture, etc., must be reduced as much as possible and placed neatly. (2) If there is a chimney passing through the attic, have you wrapped metal protection around it?

Regarding furniture and other items: (1) Do you use gas lamps or kerosene lamps? If so, please be careful at all times. (2) Do you use gasoline or kerosene to start fires? (3) When using gasoline, you must be especially careful; after use, you must place it in a very safe place. (4) Do you use gasoline to wash stains? For a safer method, it is best to use other non-flammable liquids, or send the clothes directly to the laundry. (5) Do the people in your home have a general understanding of electricity, electrical wires, etc.? (6) Are the matches you buy the best and safest kind? (7) After using an electric iron, do you place it on a metal stand? (8) Do you know that rosin combs, hairpins, and plates are extremely flammable?

In the garage and courtyard: (1) Is there a fire extinguisher in the garage? (2) Is the floor and workbench in the garage stained with gasoline?

If you can always pay attention to the above questions, you will surely keep your family away from fire. It is best to cut out these questions and browse them at any time to remind you of your occasional carelessness and negligence! Finally, please remember: humans need fire, but sometimes it can also cause disaster to humans. (Translated from the English "Great Beauty Evening News")

### Talking About Bicycles (Part 2)

— Knight

(Continued from "Living" section)

There is also something hidden deep inside the head tube of the bicycle that people do not pay attention to (that is, installed on the fork), which is actually the soul of the bicycle. Because the bicycle wheels vibrate for a long time, the head tube is damaged. If it accidentally hits something else, the fork will break, and the rider often falls to the ground and gets injured. High-quality British bicycles are equipped with AD head tubes and forks, which are very strong. Their head tubes are divided into two types, AB. The former has a thickness of eleven gauges at the upper end and sixteen gauges at the lower end, while the latter has eleven gauges at the upper end and only thirteen gauges at the lower end. Although they are the same brand, the goods are different, and buyers must carefully inspect them. The brakes are also an important part of the entire bicycle. Ordinary bicycles are equipped with rubber hand brakes or foot brakes, while racing bikes are equipped with spring-loaded brakes or car-style internal expanding brakes. The prices vary depending on the brand. Other parts such as bells and air pumps can vary by as much as five yuan per set. Once the steel pipes used for the frame are painted, it is difficult to distinguish the good from the bad. This depends on the ethical standards of the bicycle shop, because the frame brand can be easily affixed, and often after bargaining, inferior goods are used to fill the gap, which must be guarded against.

The famous bicycle shops in Shanghai all sell motorcycles, such as (1) Tongchang Bicycle Shop, managed by Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Three Guns brand bicycles, and assembled Flying Horse and Flying Man brand bicycles. (2) Anlun Bicycle Shop, managed by Ariel motorcycles, assembles Wing brand bicycles with parts from famous British factories, and promotes British Phillips bicycles. (3) Deli Bicycle Shop, managed by Raling and New Hudson bicycles, assembles Five Flags brand bicycles. (4) Dayu Bicycle Shop, specializing in selling parts to various provinces in the interior. Others, such as Rundasuchang on Avenue Edward VII, are also not small in scale and focus on business in the interior. Small bicycle shops in the city purchase parts from the above three companies, and their retail business is also quite developed.

The style of bicycles is the same every year, unlike the annual renovation of car bodies, but the gradual reduction in the frame height over the decades is a significant reform. For example, a 26-inch frame is rarely seen today. Recently, ordinary 28-inch wheels are fitted with 22 or 23-inch frames, while racing bikes are fitted with a maximum of 22-inch frames, some as low as 18 inches. Safety bicycles, which have been popular in Europe and the United States for a long time, are assembled in large quantities only by Anlun Bicycle Shop in our country. The frame is from 19 inches to 22 inches, and the wheel diameter is the same as that of racing bikes, so it is extremely light and fast. Its characteristic is the low center of gravity of the body. When stopping, the rider can touch the ground with their toes without having to get off the bike. It is not dangerous to ride on busy streets and is praised by people in the upper class. Every morning, in the western district, amidst the clatter of horses' hooves, mixed with Chinese and Western men and women riding bicycles, those with low bodies painted in various colors with cream-colored head tubes and cream-colored fenders are the famous Anlun Wing brand.

### Preservers of World Peace

— Mao Lie

Those who destroy world peace are fascist countries, so to preserve world peace, as long as fascist countries are willing to limit expansion and stop aggression, it can be done. This is of course very true; the one who tied the bell is the one who must untie it. It is naturally a hope that people cannot avoid to pull back from the precipice and know when to stop.

However, this is only an ideal and can never become a reality. Because the appetite of a glutton can never be satisfied; it only gets bigger and bigger, until it eats until it cannot digest and dies of bloating, will it naturally stop. Otherwise, if you do not give it food, and force it with strength, it can barely stop. Alexander, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, were such figures. Now, the fascist countries are at the height of their aggressive expansion, and to expect them to suddenly repent and stop automatically would truly be like seeking the skin of a tiger.

Now, there is still some distance before they reach the point of dying of bloating, so to prevent too many from being swallowed up, the only way to stop them is to force them with strength. And I believe that the key to wielding this power is Britain.

In the past, British international policy had two traditional characteristics: 1. Strict prevention of the Soviet Union. Although she did not join the Anti-Comintern Pact, her disapproval of communism and her fear of the Soviet Union becoming the world's leader was an open secret, known to all. She did not think that Germany and Italy were truly anti-communist, but only used anti-communism as a pretext to annex the weak. She feared communism more than fascism; she feared the Soviet Union more than Germany, Italy, and Japan. 2. Maintaining the balance of power. She did not want any country in the world, especially in Europe, to surpass her in prestige and strength. She always wanted to preserve the balance of power among the great powers, and to play a pivotal role in between them. Therefore, when France wanted to become strong, she allied with Germany; when the United States wanted to intervene in the Far East for justice, she did not cooperate. As a result, Germany, including Italy and Japan before, saw through this traditional British policy and dared to take advantage of the loopholes and do whatever they wanted, wantonly invading and expanding their own territories and spheres of influence.

Now, Britain is initiating a collective security organization to deal with Germany. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. If this action is successful, it is truly like a rope tied around the neck of a greedy pelican, preventing it from swallowing fish. Its effectiveness is naturally worthy of approval. However, will Britain be willing to abandon its traditional policy?

I believe that if Britain is willing to cooperate sincerely with the Soviet Union (cooperation of course does not mean implementing communism), and if it is willing to allow other countries, especially France and the United States, to increase their power, in other words, if Britain is willing to abandon its traditional international policy, then collective security can be successfully organized, and world peace can be preserved. Otherwise, it will be the same as before, collective security will be difficult to be effective, and world peace will continue to feel threatened at all times.

World peace depends on Britain. I think this is definitely not an idealistic view.

### Migration

— Xing Huo

—— Life of a Journalist in the Guerrilla Area

The summer rainstorm lashed at the awning of the boat. The raindrops were too dense, and water accumulated in the cabin. To protect the wireless equipment that could not get wet, we used our bodies to shield them, forgetting about the wetness on our backs.

In the thunder, the rain grew heavier, and our boat struggled in the middle of the river; the wind blocked our progress as the boatmen desperately rowed.

Everywhere was water. The mulberry trees that had been harvested only showed short twigs above the water. Everywhere was the sound of waterwheels, "Yi-ya, Zha, Zha, Zha..." The farmers had to exert the last of their strength in despair.

Reaching a village, the boat was poled towards the shore. With a "scrape," the boat could not move any further, it had reached the shore.

Rolling up our trousers, we stepped into the water and walked into people's houses, the water still submerging our heels. Finally, we found a relatively dry house to stay in. We began to busy ourselves with carrying things; in an empty room, we laid down planks and a few tables, arranging our "news office."

In the village, we four or five uninvited guests attracted a lot of attention, and our door was often crowded with onlookers. When we strung the antenna for the radio high up on the cypress branches, astonished gazes focused even more on us.

The radio was tested, and the sound of opera broke the silent air of the countryside.

"Oh, this thing is also available in the cloth shop in town!" The farmers gathered around listening, and many proudly showed off their knowledge.

We got up every night to record; the radio constantly emitted "Mandarin" that the farmers did not understand. In their eyes, we became even more mysterious figures.

After several moments of surprise, they began to develop a sense of fear towards us, always avoiding us, and even forbidding children from entering the house where we lived.

Now we were disconnected from the farmers, how could this work?

We began to find opportunities to explain our actions to the simple and honest farmers; at the same time, we gradually carried out indoctrination work.

It was during the dog days of summer. In the evening, the farmers returned from their work in the fields, holding a bowl of thin porridge, with a few salt-fried broad beans on top, and went to the "rice field" in front of the door to enjoy the cool. They ate porridge while chatting about the Zhang family and the Li family, whiling away the twilight hours.

The moonlight cast a veil over the wilderness, and the frogs on the edge of the field croaked.

Targeting what they were saying, we seized the opportunity. We talked about bombs, planes, divine soldiers, immortals... we talked about why the ×× were fighting in China, and why we couldn't farm and live a good life, and how we could drive the devils out. ... This is where we explained why we came to the countryside.

The more we talked, the more we removed the barriers with them. After staying for a few more days, the farmers had come to regard us as friends, often coming to our house to ask this and talk about that. The farmers' attitude towards us had changed from fear to intimacy. When we needed some tea or wanted to borrow some utensils, they rushed to bring them over.

"Use it, sir! We have plenty!" They were so earnest and generous.

But after living in this house like a "home," we had to prepare to move, because the devil's claws were flashing above our heads at any moment.

"Tomorrow, we will leave!" Under the moonlight, we looked at those simple and sincere faces.

"Isn't it good to live here?" A surge of warmth poured into our hearts from this simple question.

"It is good, but we have been staying for too long, which may be inconvenient for you!"

"What does it matter, anyway, you have all come out from your comfortable homes to do this, what do we have to lose!"

We silently looked at the people around us enjoying the cool, their eyes were fixed on us, showing questioning expressions.

Not wanting to disappoint their enthusiasm, we packed our things the next day. At this time, our house was surrounded by people, from children to grandmothers, from grandfathers to young men.

They had already carried the heavy things down to the boat; the boat was rowed by the farmers who had voluntarily stopped working in the fields to help us.

"Come and play, sirs!" As our boat pushed off, the shore was full of people "seeing us off." From the mutual gaze, one could see the reluctance between each other.

### A Casual Talk About Wall Novels

— Ba Yan

The popularity of wall novels is only a recent phenomenon of the past two or three years. I remember that since the "August 13th" Shanghai Anti-Japanese War broke out, the "National Salvation Daily" hosted by Mr. Guo Moruo and others published many wall novels. Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, the literary supplement "Sweet Dew" of the "Su Daily" founded by Mr. Zhou Houjun, a special commissioner of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, published one or two short novels of about a thousand words every day. The content, form, and subject matter were very eye-catching. These can all be categorized as wall novels.

The wall novel is a special, concise and short literary work, which, together with short stories of about ten thousand words or long masterpieces of hundreds of thousands of words, is the spiritual food of the masses. Under certain circumstances, the "subtle influence" of wall novels has a more moving power than the latter.

Some people have opposed writing wall novels, saying that this kind of short, overly "explicit" thing without connotation is too unrigorous, meticulous, and delicate, and seems to lack literary value. I am going to vote against this argument. In order to suit the level of knowledge and reading ability of the masses, I feel that wall novels should not only be promoted, but also need to be generally expanded.

The wall novel is a department of "mass literature." It is to the masses what sesame cakes and fried dough sticks costing three copper coins are – anyone can afford it, and can often eat it. It is only about one or two thousand words long, and the content and form are practical, popular, and simple. The story is also rich in the power of "edification" and "warning." As long as one has a basic knowledge of writing, anyone can read and understand it, and it only takes three to five minutes to read a novel. It is really economical.

The effect of wall novels is not only to alert and encourage the masses, but also to shoulder the mission of educating the masses. Therefore, one must be cautious, pay close attention, and carefully consider when writing: What materials should be found to be popular and stir up a little unevenness in the hearts of the masses? How should it be described to make the masses not feel dry and ordinary when reading it, but feel concise and vigorous? How should the layout be, save space, economically write a complete story, and concretely portray several typical characters in it?

Here, don't underestimate the ease of writing wall novels. If we cannot be close to the lives of the masses, we will have no way of knowing the conditions of all levels, and a wall novel written may sometimes be neither fish nor fowl, and make people laugh.

I believe that a good wall novel must have the following conditions: (1) The number of words is short and the story is complete. (2) The description is concise and the characters are portrayed vividly. (3) The dialogue is fluent, sharp, and full of edification and guidance. (4) The consciousness of the work is very correct. (5) The subject matter has timeliness, is fresh and eye-catching. (6) Find a powerful sentence or a special action from the work as the title, so that the subject matter has timeliness, is fresh and eye-catching, (6) Find a powerful sentence or a special action from the work as the title, so that the masses can easily understand it. (7) It is best to describe and narrate "people" and "things" in the same article. (8) The words and sentences must be popular and simple.

The above eight conditions are what writers of wall novels should pay attention to. Naturally, in the continuous writing process, there will be more discoveries, which can be used as new theoretical gains.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

By the next morning, it was discovered that there was no way to save her. Mayor Chen was bitter in his heart, but he did not dare to announce it, fearing that the pacification squad leader of the × side would know and come to make trouble for him. He took care of Show Yue's funeral arrangements on the one hand, and instructed his family on the other, telling them not to publicize it under any circumstances. But no matter what, he could not hide the pain in his heart. Just then, Cai Hefeng happened to visit. Mayor Chen could not hide it and had no choice but to tell Cai Hefeng about Show Yue's hanging. Cai Hefeng was filled with righteous indignation and could not help but slam his fist heavily on the table, saying:

"The devils are bullying people like this. If you continue to endure, I think you will die without a burial place!"

Mayor Chen was shocked and hurriedly covered Cai Hefeng's mouth, telling him not to make a sound, and whispered in his ear:

"How could I sincerely surrender to the devils? Don't you know that my heart feels like a sharp knife is gouging it out? I only hate that there is no way to speak out about this inescapable net!"

Seeing that Mayor Chen's words were indeed sincere, Cai Hefeng told him about the plan he had discussed with Commander Ye when he came. Mayor Chen was both surprised and delighted. He seemed to have made up his mind and gently clapped his hand on the table, saying:

"It must be done this way, otherwise I would be letting Show Yue down. Now I have decided to keep Show Yue's hanging a secret, and instead prepare for a happy event. They will probably come to marry her the day after tomorrow. On that day, I will propose holding a carnival to let those devils get completely drunk. Then, I will ask Commander Ye to start a rebellion that day, to take them by surprise, attack them unprepared, recover our Hepu Town, and avenge Show Yue in the underworld."

Cai Hefeng repeatedly said it was a good idea, but he was still a little worried and instructed Mayor Chen to be secretive and not to harm the tiger instead, and lose the country's strength.

Mayor Chen nodded repeatedly. When sending Cai Hefeng out, he suddenly remembered something and hurriedly pulled Cai Hefeng back, whispering in his ear:

"The devils have no arrangements on the west side of Taihu Lake. I want to secretly inform the boatmen here to move their boats north, and ask Commander Ye to send another strong unit to attack on their boats. In this way, with attacks from both sides, none of the devils will escape."

Cai Hefeng could not help but pat Mayor Chen on the shoulder and said:

"Good! It's decided like this." (40)

Hygiene of the Sexes

### The Greatest Obstacle to Eugenics: A General Discussion of the Evils of Early Marriage

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Now, from the standpoint of eugenics, I will talk about the harm of early marriage. Readers are already aware of the harm of early marriage, but the scope of this article is entirely focused on physiological aspects. Because the age of marriage varies depending on race, climate, environment, and culture. For example, people in the tropics, uncivilized peoples, and agricultural societies marry early, while those in cold regions, civilized societies, and industrial societies marry later. However, judging from the general situation, the harm of early marriage has penetrated deeply into people's hearts, but unfortunately, there is no countermeasure to improve the situation. According to the research results of Duquatuluoxiwa Luzhi in Berlin, the number of deaths of men who marry early is nearly twice as many per thousand than the number of deaths of unmarried men of the same age. This is truly alarming!

Nine out of ten children born to early-married couples are born with deficiencies and have no hope of being physically strong and intellectually smart. This is because the physical constitution of men and women has not yet fully matured during the period of spring affection. It is like a plant, when immature seeds are planted, they will not be able to grow strong and bear fruit in the future. The embryos left behind by the combination of immature men and women are just like this.

Before men and women mature, the development of the body and the secretions secreted by the gonads are closely related. The reproductive organs decompose nutrients in the blood to produce a substance necessary for various parts of the body. Marriage for immature people cuts off this source, so it violates the laws of nature and life cannot last long.

Young people around the age of twenty are at the time when they are receiving higher education, and need a healthy mind and body to study advanced knowledge. If they get married, their mind and body will weaken, so how can they still study advanced knowledge? Therefore, most people who marry early are in a low position in terms of academic ability in school. There are also many people whose intelligence is very high before marriage, but changes greatly after marriage; the reason for the change in attitude is also due to weakness.

To save those who have lost their health due to early marriage, the only way is to use scientific methods to increase their energy. As far as I know, the most effective method is to use the male "Boticom" made from the sperm of strong German animal testicles. It is well known to countless venereologists in Europe and America that the agent has a definite effect. Those who feel troubled by nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility due to early marriage will see the above-mentioned shameful conditions disappear immediately after taking "Boticom." Now the agent is popular all over the world, and its female counterpart functions to regulate menstruation and produce seeds. This is truly a great auxiliary for eugenics.

Modern Medicine

### Self-Destructive Gonorrhea and its Consequences

— American Medical Doctor, Huang Zhongchang

Be Careful When Choosing Medication

Regain Reproductive Ability After Recovery

Many people know that gonorrhea can easily lead to self-destruction and infertility, causing lifelong regret, but they don't know the reasons why. In fact, many patients are greedy for temporary small gains and indiscriminately take inferior medicines from the market. Such palliative treatments and those advertised as "effective in one bottle and eradicating the root in three days" are no different from being accomplices to gonorrhea. After taking them, the toxins penetrate deep into the joints, leading to arthritis, paralysis of the limbs, and becoming disabled. Or, they may enter the deep part of the reproductive organs through the posterior urethra, destroying the healthy tissues of reproduction and leading to the tragedy of infertility. Therefore, doctors in various countries, both Chinese and foreign, previously regarded gonorrhea as an incurable disease. In fact, this is entirely due to patients giving up on themselves and lacking the determination to cure it completely. Because no matter what kind of disease, there is no reason why it cannot be cured. However, doctors in various countries have now changed their previous prejudices about gonorrhea, which was once considered difficult to treat. The reason is that a special medicine for gonorrhea has been introduced to the world. What is this special medicine? It is the "Klinon," which is unanimously recognized worldwide. "Klinon" is a medicine invented by Dr. Peter of Germany after more than 30 years of effort. It is made from a mixture of yellow pigment protein. It shatters the slogan that gonorrhea is incurable. Whether it is acute or chronic gonorrhea of any kind, and its recurrent symptoms, such as gonorrheal arthritis, and gonococci invading the reproductive system and destroying reproductive function, after taking "Klinon," its bactericidal power directly reaches the lesions, so it is effective quickly and restores reproductive function. Many oral medications for gonorrhea are excreted after digestion, and inferior medicines with harsh side effects damage the stomach and intestines, causing nausea and vomiting, and reducing the body's resistance. However, taking "Klinon" has no such drawbacks, and it can safely cure all gonorrhea and never relapse, which is praised by doctors in various countries. In Switzerland and other countries, due to the invention of "Klinon," the number of gonorrhea patients has been greatly reduced.

### The Most Effective Medicine for Treating Spermatorrhea

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Since spermatorrhea is a common disease among young people, the methods for treating it must be carefully studied. Most of the inferior products on the market that claim to be effective medicines for spermatorrhea are only effective temporarily, and have significant side effects that irritate the stomach and intestines, and are absolutely ineffective for patients with spermatorrhea. As a doctor, I want to reverse this trend and have to introduce several effective medicines to patients. If patients feel that they have neurasthenia and other symptoms caused by untreated spermatorrhea, they can take the male "Bu Ti Kang," a preparation refined from German male animal testicles, three times a day. This is a treatment for neurasthenia. Combined with taking "Naires Spermatorrhea Tablets," not only can spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission be completely cured, but also the developmental deficiencies, infertility, and premature aging caused by spermatorrhea can be cured one by one in a short period of time. In addition, electrical therapy, warm water sitz baths, and cold water massage of the affected area also have considerable effects. Regarding the treatment of spermatorrhea, choosing effective medicines to consolidate the seminal gate is essential, but if you do not pay attention to health or have masturbatory behavior, even taking large amounts of medicine will still be ineffective.

Gonorrhea Lecture
— Narrated by Doctor Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

### Is Excessive Drinking and Lust Harmful to Leucorrhea?

Wine and Lust are the Demons of Gonorrhea

Maintaining strict health habits is essential in the treatment of gonorrhea. As the saying goes, "Treatment is 30%, Maintenance is 70%." Unfortunately, most gonorrhea patients do not pay attention to health maintenance, especially indulging in wine and lust. As a result, the symptoms of gonorrhea immediately worsen and become terrifying. The most obvious symptoms are gonorrheal arthritis, prostatitis, orchitis, and seminal vesiculitis, etc. In my experience, these are often found in those who indulge in wine and lust. The reason why we can strongly resist gonorrhea is because we rely on our physical strength. If physical strength is weakened and cannot resist external invaders, then it will inevitably be harmed by gonorrhea.

Early Warning is the Best Policy

Now, taking prostatitis as an example, this disease is the easiest to get among gonorrhea patients and has the greatest relationship with reproduction, because prostatic fluid is an essential element for nurturing sperm, so it has a great impact on fertility. Therefore, to avoid the above-mentioned diseases, one must quickly reflect, abstain from alcohol and sex as the first priority, and then use the most effective static electricity therapy in Germany. Anti-Gonorrhea Serum is also a leader in serum therapy. "Klinon" is the authority in gonorrhea treatment among oral medications. If you can combine all of the above treatments to treat the above-mentioned diseases, everything will be easily solved. This is an effective treatment that I have proven effective in my 20 years of experience, and there has never been a case of failure. Compared with any other treatment, the results are not even one ten-thousandth as good as this treatment. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting from a few days ago, 20 patients will be seen every day, and each number will only cost five jiao.

### Proven Treatment for Lung Disease

— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang

Patient Mr. Lu Rongxin, working in a certain store, suffered from high fever and thick phlegm pneumonia, which developed into chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. The temperature remained constantly high, around 37 degrees Celsius. It would rise to 38 degrees with slight movement. Coughing up phlegm and coughing blood, shortness of breath, poor appetite, the body became thinner and weaker day by day due to the continuous heat consumption, anemia, pale skin, and repeated treatments were ineffective. I was asked to treat him, and I directly used X-ray examination. As a result, a silver coin-sized cavity was found on the right lung lobe. I told him to rest at home and take "Bu Fei Na Er." After Mr. Lu tried taking three bottles, his appetite greatly increased, his cough sharply decreased, the thick phlegm thinned, and there were no longer any blood spots in the phlegm. The fever was reduced, and he was able to sleep soundly at night. So he continued to take several bottles of "Bu Fei Na Er," and the dangerous lung disease was completely cured. After further recuperation, his health recovered.

P.S.: Bu Ti Kang for men and women is 5 yuan per bottle. Naires Spermatorrhea Tablets are 2 yuan per bottle. Bu Fei Na Er is 2.5 yuan per bottle. Klinon is 2.5 yuan per bottle. Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets are 2.5 yuan per bottle. Anti-Gonorrhea Water is 2.5 yuan per bottle. All pharmacies sell them. For mail orders from other places, please remit money directly to Hai Mi Deng Drugstore, No. 9 Ningbo Road, British Concession, Shanghai, and they will be mailed to you.

Arts and Entertainment

### Purely Hardcore Soviet Movies

— Pei Ying

The film industry occupies a very important position in this special Soviet Union. However, Soviet films have absolutely no sensual, romantic, supernatural, or song and dance films. They are all purely hardcore historical films and war films. This is the only way to make films help the progress of the Five-Year Plan. It can also fulfill the propaganda obligations for Stalin. Therefore, the early Soviet films were mostly current affairs films and propaganda films. Since the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan, due to the increased level of cultural entertainment among the people, there have been films with themes based on work, society, and love. "Merry Fellows," directed by Aleksandrov, was the first shot of this type of soft film.

Cartoons and color films are as naive as newborn children, and there are not many films. Some of the better ones are the color film "Circus" and the cartoon "New Gulliver." As for colorful cartoons like "Snow White," they have not been discovered so far. It can be seen that the Soviet film industry is still naive.

The most famous historical film is "Peter the Great," which was screened at the Guotai Theater in Shanghai and was well received by people from all walks of life. The scale of this film is no less than that of Hollywood's "Million Dollar Epic." It is the first major Soviet film to go abroad, and is similar to China's "Diao Chan."

"Thirteen Red Army Heroes" and "The Last Night" are two films made to commemorate the great deeds of revolutionary soldiers. The plot and actors of these two films are not bad, but unfortunately there is no capable and lively director, so there are some shortcomings.

The famous film "Chapaev" is about a hero in the era of internal strife. This film is an outstanding work in sound films and broke the film record of the "Potemkin" era. The film that received the highest evaluation among the new films last year was "Lenin in October" directed by Romm. This film is a great epic that brings together national movie stars.

Recently, Soviet films have gradually focused on national defense issues. The films produced, such as "One Day on the Border" and "For the Motherland," are all based on border disputes and spies to enhance the national defense concept of the people.

The film "Komsomolsk," which is currently being produced, depicts the life of communist workers, which is nothing more than another propaganda film for communism. There is also a film based on a folk hero in the era of Imperial Russia. In this film, there is a scene where German troops retreat in embarrassment on a frozen river, and later the ice breaks and they drown. This scene is an unprecedented page in the history of Soviet film photography.

Because the Soviet government recognized the lack of film talent and the bleak future of the film industry, it recently established a film school in the suburbs of the capital, cultivating more than two hundred talents such as stars, directors, scene designers, and photographers. After graduation, the government guarantees that they will go to work in film companies and also awards them honorary medals to reward them for serving the country.

In short, the Soviet Union is an advancing country. The government can work hard to promote it, and the people are willing to work hard, so their film industry is also flourishing with the national power. Although our country is now in the period of the War of Resistance, the final victory must belong to us. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese film industry will work hard to prepare for the prelude to the revival of China!

### A Meeting with Miss Tang Ruoqing, Who Returned to Hong Kong from Guilin

— Nie Ge, Reporting from Hong Kong

Miss Ruoqing, the eldest daughter of Tang Huaiqiu of the China Travel Drama Troupe, recently arrived in Hong Kong from Guangxi (the reporter previously reported that Ruoqing had returned to Hong Kong, but it was a misunderstanding that Ruoqing had sent a letter to her father saying that she had set off for Hong Kong). Although Ruoqing was covered in dust, she was still lively. When the reporter visited Ruoqing at the China Travel Drama Troupe, Huaiqiu was rehearsing a new play, "Phoenix City." When a scene was rehearsed and rested, I started chatting with Ruoqing and started talking. Ruoqing was eloquent, answering my questions in fluent Mandarin, which was very pleasant to listen to. The following is what she answered:

"I often hear the news that the China Travel Drama Troupe has separated. I am very sad. My father told me to return to Hong Kong immediately. I really wanted to fly back. Now that I have arrived in Hong Kong, seeing the changes in personnel, I am really filled with emotion.

Performing National Defense Drama in Guilin

"I left Hong Kong last year to go to Changsha to visit my grandmother. I was raised by my grandmother since I was a child, so as soon as I heard that my grandmother's old illness had recurred, I hurriedly set off. When I went, I took a bus from Kowloon to Guangzhou. After staying in Guangzhou for a few days, I drove all the way to Hunan. A few days before the Changsha fire, there was a tense atmosphere in the market. At that time, I left Changsha and ran to Guilin. Because the highway was destroyed by enemy planes, I encountered many obstacles in the middle. In Guilin, I was welcomed by many friends in the theater circle. They wanted me to give them some encouragement and help in terms of art and friendship. It was difficult to refuse both publicly and privately, so I agreed and joined the "National Defense Art Society" and performed two national defense dramas, "The Roar of the Ancient City" and "The Noctilucent Cup," which were greatly supported by the Guangxi authorities and welcomed by the people. The people of Guangxi are really full of ardent patriotic flames. The patriotic movement is surging and high, which is by no means comparable to other places, and the folk customs are simple, which is very different from Hong Kong.

Drama Going to the Mainland

"This time coming to Hong Kong from Guangxi is really not an easy task. If it weren't for the cartoonist Ye Qianyu (Ye recently launched the Hong Kong Cartoonist Association in Hong Kong to carry out national salvation through cartoon propaganda) and other colleagues, I'm afraid I wouldn't know how to return to Hong Kong. We took a bus to Longzhou, and then took the Yisheng Wheel to Hong Kong via Hanoi and Haiphong. On the Yisheng ship, the enemy sent people on board to search. Ye Qianyu was carrying many pieces of cartoons depicting the enemy's atrocities, but fortunately they were not found, otherwise it would have been troublesome. "I think it's better for the China Travel Drama Troupe to expand to the mainland. Guilin, Kunming, Chongqing, especially the northwest, the past journey of the China Travel Drama Troupe is quite long, and only the northwest lacks our footprints. I firmly believe that the drama movement and the army are the same need for organization. What the China Travel Drama Troupe should strive for at present is how to get in touch with domestic drama groups, and even join their organizations and merge with them.

New Play to be Staged Soon

"We will stage a new play in Hong Kong in no more than a month. After this performance, our forward route can be determined. All the plays performed in this performance are new plays, such as "Phoenix City," "Tears of Flowers," "Motherland," "Our Hometown," "Glorious Death," "Wilderness," "Wu Zetian," and "Border Situation," etc., which will be performed continuously. Most of them are performed in Mandarin, and several plays will be performed in Cantonese to cater to compatriots who do not understand Mandarin. Among them, "Phoenix City" is a script that I brought from Guilin, and I play the heroine in the play. "It is very difficult to choose scripts for performing in Hong Kong. National defense plays often cannot be passed, so we can only do our responsibility as much as possible under possible circumstances to meet the needs of the times. Thunderstorm and Sunrise have become things of the past, and we will never rehearse them again. What we are more willing to introduce at present are the scripts after the first phase of the War of Resistance. When we return to the mainland in the future, the situation will be different, and we will use more manpower to work hard.

"This time we will stage Cao Yu's one of the three major works, "Wilderness," and we have changed the places that are not suitable for stage performance. For example, the scenes of the ox-headed and horse-faced men are too funny, so we have omitted them.

Speaking of this, the second act of "Phoenix City" is about to be rehearsed, and I can't talk any further.

### Zhao Dan and His Wife Will Return to Shanghai

— Ying Nian

Zhao Dan, this outstanding talent on the Chinese silver screen, has the film fans not forgotten him yet? Indeed, his superb skills and dashing demeanor once captivated many film fans. He and his wife, Ms. Ye Luqian, were originally stage actors, and later they both stepped onto the screen, revealing their position on the Chinese film scene. Later, in order to maintain the lives of a group of stage actors, he resolutely abandoned his achievements on the screen and returned to the stage with his wife. This spirit of sacrificing the individual to maintain everyone is indeed rare in the film industry. (When he was an actor in the Mingxing Company, his monthly salary was 200 yuan, and when he returned to the stage to perform dramas, his monthly salary was only 180 yuan.)

Before the "August 13th" Incident, he and Yu Peishan, Wang Weiyi, etc. organized a troupe to perform in the mainland, and won the love of many people along the way. Later, he entered the Central Photography Studio and became a staff member of the studio with Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei at the same time.

Now, according to his letter, he and Ms. Ye are tired of traveling and miss home. At the same time, Zhao's old mother missed her son so much that she also wrote a letter urging them to return to Shanghai. Therefore, the return date of Zhao Dan and his wife will not be far away. Moreover, it is said that a certain film company has sent a letter to shoot a film. If it is true, then when the lotus blooms, Shanghai film fans can see his heroic posture again.

By the way, they are also bringing a toddler who is learning to speak with them on this return to Shanghai, that is, the little Zhao Dan, their second crystallization! (Zhao Dan has a daughter, who is four years old.)

The film "Daji" has not yet started shooting because the costumes and props are still being made. Diao Banhua may first show her face in "Wang Baochuan" directed by Wu Cun and "Four Demon Kings" directed by Wang Jue Neng.

### Diao Banhua Eats Garlic to Treat Lung Disease

— Yu Sheng

Spearmint Candy Has Become Her Beloved Thing

Diao Banhua once traveled to Hong Kong and joined the Yihua Film Company after being introduced by Wang Cilong, signing a long-term contract. The Yihua authorities were preparing to produce the costume film "Daji," with Diao Banhua as the lead. Diao Banhua's reputation in the film industry was well-known in the past, and it was not difficult to make her popular. Who knew that her fate was so ill-fated that she suddenly fell ill for more than a month recently, and she was suffering from lung disease. After the doctor's diagnosis, he said that she must rest well. So she had to stay at home and eat a lot of garlic. It is said that this thing can treat the lungs. After more than a month of recuperation, she recently felt better and could go out for a walk. However, the garlic smell has not yet disappeared, because lung disease is not like other symptoms and will not fully heal in a while. Diao Banhua has always been clean, but she had to eat garlic because of her illness, and she was afraid of the mouth odor, so after eating garlic, she hurriedly ate spearmint candy again to eliminate the foul smell. Therefore, in recent times, spearmint candy has almost become her beloved thing.

### Film Industry News

— Xin Xia

Zhang Shichuan will direct "Three Smiles," and is currently looking for outdoor locations. The company recruited actors for "Zhao Wuniang" and received 4,600 letters, but only 1% of them had the qualifications to be candidates.

Lu Ming's costume in "Red Powder Drifting" is like Anna Du Ping in "Jing Kou Nian Hua," with bare breasts and high hair, which is very interesting. No wonder she is regarded as the Oriental Anna by Western newspapers.

Sun Min and Chen Yunshang starred in "Fairy Yunshang." It is said that Chen has many similarities to "Ying Yin Type," which is indeed true.

Jin Yan's Lin Chong has been filmed for more than half.

After the end of "Tears of Song," Wu Cun will write a heavy satirical drama, but it is not a costume film. According to Zhang Shichuan, Wu is a "regular army" of the Datong Film Studio, and the various rumors outside are difficult to believe.

Zhang Shankun went to Hong Kong a few days ago to discuss the "Yang Guifei" matter with Hu Die.

Xinhua and Yihua have both signed long-term contracts with Xi Qiuqiu. Guohua is also trying to retain her. Ms. Xi's recent films have been very popular in Nanyang, and many letters and telegrams have been ordered for her new film.

Standard recording engineer He Zhaozhang will have good news this year.

Chen Yunshang left a handkerchief in the dressing room. It is said that this handkerchief has been obtained by a certain film collector, and there are bright lipstick marks on the handkerchief.

It is said that Han Langan recently mistakenly recognized a foreigner bodyguard of a certain celebrity as the General Manager Mu of the United Film Company, which is also a joke.

The Shanghai Drama and Art Society has signed a contract with the Xinguang Theater and decided to hold Sunday experimental performances every Sunday morning from March 26 to July 16. It is heard that the first performance of the society on March 26 has been decided to be Li Jianwu's famous work "This is Just Spring." According to reports, the play was performed by the Chinese Students Association in Japan in Tokyo, causing a sensation. Domestic universities also competed to perform it, and each performance achieved excellent results.

### Finance Hong Kong Group Makes Large Purchases, Cash Price Increase Intensifies

——Closing Price Reaches 2,086 Yuan——

Yesterday, the hidden market situation for spot gold continued to be high, repeatedly breaking through the 2,070 yuan and 2,080 yuan levels. This was mainly because the European situation showed slight relaxation, so the sentiment of all parties changed from fatigue to stability. The Hong Kong group, which had been quiet for a long time, suddenly made a large and vigorous advance, and the Northern group also wanted to repurchase all the physical goods they had sold off in the previous few days. In addition, gold firms also followed suit in their search, so the price soared straight up, reaching the best peak of the day at 2,086 yuan at closing. However, the momentum weakened midway due to the foreign exchange market being dumped by the China Bank and Hong Kong Electric, so the Qian Dui Ye (money exchange businesses) on behalf of the local groups sold off more actively, causing a slight decline. In the end, supply could not keep up with demand, so it was difficult to maintain for long. As a result, the price surged by 21 yuan. The sentiment of all parties was quite stable, and trading was more active than the previous day, at about 900 taels. Silver jewelry also rose by 2 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to trend downwards.

Spot Gold Price Increases by 21 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially heard buyers calling for 2,066 or 2,067 yuan, but sellers were asking for 2,073 or 2,075 yuan, making it difficult to open trading. Both sides held out until 9:50 AM, when a certain silver firm purchased 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 2,070 yuan, 5 yuan higher than the previous closing. After opening, a gold firm purchased 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at a price of 2,073 yuan. Later, a certain silver firm purchased another 50 taels from the same trade at 2,075 yuan, then another 50 taels from the same trade at 2,075 yuan, and then another 50 taels from the Qian Dui Ye at 2,078 yuan. Another silver firm also purchased 50 taels from the same trade at the same price. Subsequently, a certain broker purchased 50 taels from a securities group at 2,079 yuan. Although a certain silver firm continued to make purchases at that time, the operators sold actively because they heard that the foreign exchange market was easing, so the price went down. A Qian Dui Ye sold 50 taels to a certain silver firm at 2,076 yuan, silver firms traded 50 taels among themselves at 2,073 yuan, and a Qian Dui Ye sold 50 taels to a certain silver firm at 2,072 yuan. Another Qian Dui Ye also sold 50 taels to a certain silver firm at the same price (it was heard that the purchases made by the silver firm were mostly on behalf of the Hong Kong group). Subsequently, a certain Qian Dui Ye sold another 50 taels to a fellow trade at 2,071 yuan and 50 taels to a gold firm at 2,070 yuan. After that, sellers became scarce, and the price rose again. A silver firm purchased 30 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 2,072 yuan, Qian Dui Ye traded 50 taels among themselves at 2,074 yuan. Later, a gold firm purchased 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 2,076 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. The afternoon market was filled with buying orders because a certain silver firm continued to make vigorous purchases, so the price continued to rise. First, a certain silver firm purchased 50 taels from a gold firm at 2,080 yuan, then another 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 2,082 yuan. After that, gold firms also came to buy, so the momentum became even stronger. A gold firm purchased 50 taels from a silver firm at 2,085 yuan, and then another 50 taels from a silver firm at 2,086 yuan. It was already 3:30 PM at that time. After that, buyers still wanted to absorb more, but sellers would only supply at 2,090 yuan, so no trades were made. Therefore, the closing price for the evening session remained at 2,086 yuan. As a result, the price increased by 21 yuan compared to the previous closing, having risen for two consecutive days, totaling 28 yuan. The difference between the highest and lowest prices for the entire day was 16 yuan. The selling price of the current gold firm's brand gold was 2,095 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,080 yuan. Currently, the benchmark gold price is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but no trades have been made.

Price of Gold Jewelry Increased Twice

The price of silver jewelry in silver firms remained unchanged in the beginning, but at 10:05 AM, due to the strong upward trend of spot gold, it was also increased by 1 yuan. Then, at around 3:30 PM, because the momentum of spot gold was even stronger, it was increased by another 1 yuan. Da Tong Heng changed its listed price to 212 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng also changed its listed price to 210 yuan, with a purchase price of 204 yuan.

Pure Gold Further Decreases by One Penny

According to a London telegram from the 21st, British pure gold continued to fall by one penny per ounce due to the strengthening of the British exchange rate, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pence. As a result, the China Central Bank's advanced purchase price also decreased to 1,211.6 yuan, and the listed price of Customs gold also fell by 2 li, amounting to 2.374 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also decreased by 7 jiao, amounting to 1,206.9 yuan.

### Gold Pounds and Gold Notes Show Different Trends, Demand for French Franc Notes is Particularly Strong

Yesterday, British pure gold rose by one penny, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 125. In the local foreign exchange market, the trend was firm because Hong Kong Electric supplied a large amount and various banks also sold a lot, while borrowing was not strong. The opening of spot gold was stable. Later, the Tianjin group rose up to absorb, and retail investors followed suit, causing the atmosphere, which had been quiet for many days, to become tense again. This was because the rising trend was lurking, so changes were easy to occur once there was a search for purchases, which was not accidental. Foreign currency showed divergent trends in rising and falling. British and American gold pounds rose with the surge in spot gold, while British and American gold notes fell with the easing of exchange rates. Trading was not strong. The demand for French franc notes was particularly strong because they were needed for travel to Sichuan, Yunnan, Vietnam, so Annam notes also rose slightly. There were few transactions in the association, with only Yong Tai showing slightly stronger demand. It was estimated that Ying Feng sold 4,000 French franc notes, Zhen Xing sold 2,200 French franc notes, Hui Tong sold 180 Dutch new notes, and Yong Feng sold 1,000 US dollar notes. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pounds rose by 3 jiao, British gold notes fell by 1 jiao, American gold pounds rose by 2 jiao, American gold notes fell by 1 fen and 8 li, Hong Kong silver fell by half a fen, French franc notes rose by 7 hao and a half, Singapore notes fell by 1 fen, Annam notes rose by 3 fen, Canadian notes fell by 2 fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.

Discount Rate Stable

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and promissory notes remained extremely stable, consistently fluctuating between 50 yuan and 50.05 yuan per thousand, with the final rate being 50.025 yuan, the same as the previous day's price.

### China Bank and Hong Kong Electric Sell Heavily, British and American Exchange Markets Both Ease

Yesterday, the exchange market eased because of the sudden heavy selling by China Bank and the continuous selling from Hong Kong Electric. Although the Central Bank came to support it, the banks were willing to sell, so there was no impact. In addition, the British-American exchange rate became more firm, so the US exchange rate was particularly weak. However, there were no special changes on that day. Trading was quite active in the first half of the day. The Hong Kong exchange rate weakened because foreign firms resold.

In the early morning, the London long-term exchange rate contracted by 0.0625 and the forward exchange rate also contracted by 0.125. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London raw gold price continued to fall by one penny. The exchange rate of British pounds against US dollars was 7 hao higher, against French francs was slightly higher by 3 centimes, and against Shanghai was unchanged. The exchange rate of US dollars against British pounds was 125 higher, against French francs was unchanged, and against Shanghai was 1 jiao higher. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices of banks in the morning were: British exchange rate was 8 pence 265625, US exchange rate was 16.125 yuan, with the British exchange rate being 0.015625 lower and the US exchange rate being 0.03125 higher compared to the previous closing. After opening, foreign firms first came to support it. HSBC British exchange rate was 8 pence 25, and a certain bank also bought in US dollars at a rate of 16.125 yuan, so the situation was quite flat. The HSBC listed price remained unchanged, and the White Silver Balance Tax contracted by 2 and a half li, accounting for 5.00%. After that, Hong Kong Electric and China Bank sold heavily, and various banks found it difficult to buy, so the underlying momentum continued to weaken. China Bank and Hong Kong Electric successively sold British exchange rates to HSBC, Jardine Matheson, and the Netherlands bank at 8 pence 28125. Subsequently, a certain bank sold US dollar exchange rates to Banque Belge pour l'Etranger at 16.1875 yuan. Near noon, a foreign firm suddenly sold Hong Kong exchange rates to China Bank at 55.25 yuan, which also loosened the market. By the time the banks' selling prices closed at noon, the British exchange rate was 8 pence 28125 and the US exchange rate was 16.1875 yuan. As a result, the British exchange rate was 0.03125 lower and the US exchange rate was 0.09375 higher compared to the previous closing, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was also cheaper by 0.125. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The trading records for the first half of the day are listed below:

British Far Eastern Stocks Improve

After several days of weakness, the securities hidden market reversed course yesterday, with Class E bonds hovering around the 50 yuan mark for several periods. Yesterday, they suddenly broke through the 50 yuan barrier again, while Class C bonds broke through 51 yuan. Investor sentiment strengthened, market prices were active, and most people adopted an optimistic view again. At the opening in the morning, the trend was weak, as the North Group, including Defu No. 5, Tianxing, Songmao, and others, sold heavily, slightly weakening prices. However, Dafeng, Tongkang, Xinfengyong, and No. 4 successively absorbed the sell orders, and the market price gradually rose, with Class C bonds approaching 50 yuan. Although No. 5 continued to sell off in the afternoon and Tongkang also reversed from buying to selling, the buyers' appetite was strong, and Tongxin, Dafeng, Hengfu, and retail investors all made considerable purchases. The price continued to rise by 3 to 5 jiao, Class C bonds broke through 51 yuan, and Class E bonds broke through 50 yuan. The situation was very stable, and market prices ended up rising by 9 to 9 jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was approximately 600,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

### Yarn and Cotton Hoarders Insistently Sell, Cotton Yarn Weak and Difficult to Save

20-count Yarn Drops by 6-7 Yuan Each

Virgin Single Yarn Plummets by 19 Yuan

After a long period of hovering, yarn and cloth suddenly declined yesterday, falling to around 391 yuan. Various parties came to raise prices, and this happened several times, but the stockpiles became thicker and thicker, and the actual demand remained sluggish and weak. However, the so-called wealthy people in the market shouted that hoarders were particularly keen to search for and collect Double Horse and Virgin brands, keeping them closed and supporting them. As a result, they hovered between 395 yuan for a long time. Due to the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang and the gathering of Japanese warships, the shipment of goods by that group was temporarily suspended, so people were afraid and general floating funds rushed to sell. The market price showed a downward trend, breaking through the low price since February 10th, at 391 yuan. Yesterday, it immediately reached 387 yuan. Fortunately, the Hong Kong group suddenly came to handle about 300 packages of the Double Horse brand because of the cheap price, which brought a lot of encouragement. Otherwise, it would have fallen even further. In the afternoon, the price of 32-count Virgin single yarn plummeted by 19 yuan compared to the previous day, with the price being 546 yuan. The comparative price was not even funny.

In the current yarn situation, the market opened in the early morning, and because reports said that the Japanese warships fiercely bombarded Wenzhou and there were rumors of landings in Xiaoshan, people were uneasy and floating households unanimously sold, with asking prices suddenly falling. Double Horse fell by 3 and a half yuan, to 390 yuan. Guangbang Wanxing ate in more than 300 packages, and the downward trend was greatly reversed. Before long, sellers still came in droves, and the market price gradually declined, breaking through the 90 yuan mark. The final price was 387 yuan. In the afternoon, hoarders suddenly came to output files, cutting off hundreds of packages of 20-count Double Horse foreign goods, falling another 5 jiao, with the price being 396.5 yuan. The price of 32-count Virgin single yarn continued to fall, and the downward trend was fierce, but some people came to take advantage of the cheap goods. As a result, all groups bought a total of 1,855 packages throughout the day, with transactions among peers accounting for more than half. In terms of market conditions, 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 7 yuan compared to the previous day, Virgin fell by 6 and a half yuan, and Special Jincheng fell by 6 and a half yuan. 32-count single yarn fell by an average of more than 10 yuan. Today's exports included 5 pieces of yarn to Xiamen and 90 pieces to Quanzhou. The amount purchased by each group is recorded on the left:

(Hong Kong) 410 Peers 295 Mainland 30 Yunnan 85

Shantou 80 Quanzhou 35 Xiamen 5 Wenzhou 15

Statistics 1,855

The Japanese yarn market remained calm, and the current yarn closing price was not much different from the previous day due to poor sales. However, the intention to do more in the next month suddenly became strong, and the market situation turned firm. The current yarn price of 20-count Water Moon was 339 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20-count Blue Phoenix was in the range of 328-329 yuan.

### US Loan Cotton Exports Subsidized at 4 Fen Per Pound, It Is Said

Domestic Cotton Prices Move Forward Steadily

Factories Slightly Replenish Foreign Cotton

In the foreign cotton market, New York cotton cloth was unusually complex due to the Washington cotton industry bill. The day before, Yiyuan Qiaoqi strongly opposed the US cotton export subsidy and US cotton dumping policy in Congress. However, according to opinions expressed yesterday by US Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, because the number of surplus cotton produced in the United States over the years is too large, there is in fact no other way than to dump this stored cotton overseas. Market discussion about cotton export subsidies has become active again. It is rumored that 1.6 million bales of loan cotton from 1934 may be used for export, and anyone who exports this cotton can receive a subsidy of 4 fen per pound from the government based on the customs export declaration. New York felt quite fatigued yesterday, falling more than 10 pounds due to public settlement and Wall Street sales. India, including forecasts, fell by half a rupee, and Egypt rebounded by more than 30 pounds. Exchange rates were not much different yesterday, converting to legal currency. US cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell by 4 jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by 1.2 yuan. Foreign cotton trading in the Shanghai market had been quiet for many days. Recently, factories have been opening a lot of cotton yarn, so yesterday the factories slightly replenished raw cotton. Yong'an bought 300 bales of Brazilian cotton, Xinhuo bought 500 bales, and bought 500 bales of Indian cotton. Xinyu bought 3,000 bales of US cotton and 200 bales of Brazilian cotton. Tongyi bought 300 bales of Rangoon cotton, and Gongda and Yufeng bought 500 bales of Brazilian cotton. Shanghai bought 2,000 bales of US cotton. The converted market price of foreign cotton is listed below:

Raw Material Category Delivery to Factory Including Tax

60-count Egyptian Cotton Superior 107.75

Also Medium 104.85

80-count Also Superior 131.65

Also Medium 121.50

20-count US Mitterling 84.55

Also Inferior 71.45

32-count Also 93.25

Also Inferior 82.40

42-count Also 95.10

Also Inferior 83.30

Also South American Brazilian Cotton Superior 88.85

Also Medium 85.95

Also Inferior 76.40

10-count Indian Pingguoer 62.10

16-count Indian Omera 64.70

20-count Also 72.45

24-count Indian Bairuoqu 89.85

32-count US Xin Te 85.00

32-count 42-count US Peng Jiapu 89.45

Although the domestic cotton trade is not thriving, prices are steadily advancing. Tongzhou cotton has risen to over 80 yuan, and Huoji cotton has also reached 72 yuan, both rising 5 jiao to 7 jiao and a half compared to the previous day. However, factories are unwilling to purchase due to the tragic decline in the yarn market. In fact, various sources are blocked and freight is huge, so the cotton merchants are strenuously pulling prices. It is also said that if the yarn price continues to decline, the factory appetite will naturally be sluggish. If the cotton from hoarders can be sold, there may be some hope for the market price to return to normal. The fundamental problem is that the underlying goods are too weak. As the situation in eastern Zhejiang becomes tighter, the source of Zhejiang cotton may be affected. In terms of sources in northern Jiangsu, there are only 433 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

### Oil Cake Soybean Oil Fluctuates Greatly

Soybean Cake Hoarders Actively Purchase

Oil Market Yesterday, only soybean oil had a market, and the fluctuations throughout the day were quite large. In the early morning, because the opening of Dalian reported a decline, people's hearts were weak, and some people returned to make profits, causing the market to fall by 2 or 3 jiao. Afterwards, there were rumors of insufficient cabin space, so general floating funds became active again, and the market price rose again, even exceeding the highest price of the previous day. However, the combined market did not rise, so people's hearts were scattered, and the market price finally fell downstream, with no difference from the market price of the previous day. Yesterday, the total market recorded 100 pieces of Yianqi soybean oil, with the price being the original 23.4 yuan, and 100 pieces of Lianqi, 30 yuan. 100 barrels of Fengnian oil were delivered in 7 days, at 31.45 yuan. 300 barrels of current Dalian oil were priced at 31.95 to 32.2 yuan, 150 barrels were delivered in 7 days, at 32.05 to 32.1 jiao, 300 barrels were delivered in late March, at 31.85 to 32 yuan, 600 barrels were delivered in April, at 31.8 to 32 yuan, and 350 barrels were delivered in May, at 31.6 to 31.85 yuan.

Soybean Cake The stockpiling appetite was lively, and there were no major changes in the market yesterday. 20,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cake for May delivery were traded at a price of 3.14 and 3.15 yuan, and 5,000 pieces for late June delivery were priced at 3.17 yuan.

Today, 760 bags of soybeans and 2,830 pieces of soybean cake were transported to Xiamen, 400 bags of soybeans and 1,200 pieces of soybean cake were transported to Quanzhou.

### Grains The Rise of Silver Dollar Rice Has Been Checked Through the Regulation of Foreign Dollar Rice

Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Continues to Fall by 1-2 Jiao

Yesterday, the source of He rice was still not much, with only boat No. 4 arriving. The wheel transported more than 2,000 bags of buns, and the sales market continued to be deserted, so the market was still difficult to improve. Moreover, hoarders continued to withdraw, resulting in thick and thin Japonica rice continuing to fall by 1-2 jiao. However, Du Yangjian and Bu Jian rice prices showed a fixed position due to the scarcity of arrivals. The rise in silver yuan rice has also been checked due to the arrival of foreign yuan rice for regulation, and the market has tended to stabilize.

### The Price Drop of Hakka Xian Rice Has Caused New Stockpiling

Yesterday, there was a continuous arrival of Hakka Xian rice, and the rice shops also sought to sell at high prices. Moreover, with the sharp decline in various Japonica yuan rice, the market was difficult to support, and various Jingwu Xian rice varieties were small 1-2 jiao. The previously bargained price of 13.35 yuan to Gaojing Xian rice only opened at 13.1 jiao. Dashi Jingxian rice was priced at 13 yuan to 12.89 jiao, and Wuxian rice was priced at 12.89 jiao, with the difference between medium and secondary grades varying. However, after the price drop, new hoarders and retailers absorbed the rice, so the total transaction volume for the entire day increased to 4,400-4,500 bags.

### Flour Customer Price Continues to Be 5 Fen Lower

Wholesale Price in This Area Unchanged

Australian Flour Telegram Reports Rise

The current flour market trend has turned downwards again. Inquiries show that the prices offered by local factories have failed to align. The transactions made as whole batches by the Beiyang gang has shown some hope of expansion after the price decrease at the start of the week. But the water exchange rates has been hard to calculate and the price has been seen as too high. In order to open up sales channels in Tianjin, the factory has specially lowered it another 5 fen, hoping to compete with foreign flour. It is also said that a large number of foreign flour previously scheduled to be delivered to Tianjin has newly arrived. The hearts of the ancient people have softened and the market has been even more affected. According to the total market sales, each brand sold about 100,000 bags or more. Except for about 20,000 bags handled by the Fushanding gang, the rest were handled by the Jilu gang and various scattered gangs. The customer price of No. 2 flour was 4.6 jiao, which was 5 fen less than previously seen. As for the wholesale price of this session, it still needed to be 4.65 jiao. It is heard that this side of the street holds out and does not accept it, so the sold goods have not been settled. It is generally expected that the wholesale price will also be reduced today or tomorrow.

Another report says that trading in foreign flour in the Shanghai market has gradually started to develop since foreign prices have fallen. It is found that the distributors in Shanghai include foreign firms such as Dafu, Heyi, Fujia, Shunquanlong, Weida, Liji, and Jianyuan Company. There are three types: Australian, US, and Canadian, all of which are No. 2 flour, with similar quality, but slightly different viscosity. Shanghai's best-selling flour is Australian flour, which has the best viscosity, followed by Canadian flour, and US flour has less viscosity and whiter color, which also has its advantages. Today, the price of Australian wheat has been reported to have risen, and a foreign firm has released a telegram for Lion brand Australian flour, which requires an increase of up to £6 11 shillings per ton, so no transactions have been made. Currently, spot foreign flour such as Clock Tower and Colorful Bird brands is priced at more than 4.6 yuan per bag for retail cash, which is not as relaxed as last week.

Today, exports of flour include 5,000 bags to Tianjin, 5,000 bags to Yantai, 7,500 bags to Weihaiwei, 13,500 bags to Xiamen, and 4,250 bags to Quanzhou. Wheat bran exports include 500 bags to Xiamen and 14,430 bags to Quanzhou.

The wheat market has stalled and no transactions have been made.

### Seafood New Mushrooms for Sale

Tunxi Fragrant Mushrooms have already appeared on the market. The first batch of goods consisted of 28 pieces, with large and plump pieces of good quality. They opened yesterday with prices ranging from 237.8 to 244.5 yuan, and the trend was stable. Thick mushrooms were priced at 291 to 281 yuan, and large pieces were priced at 344.8 yuan.

### New Siamese Mussels Supply Scarce

Since new dried mussels appeared at the beginning of the month, the supply of Luoluo dried mussels has been scarce. For example, the new small dried mussels previously sold for 70 yuan, and there have been no reports of further sales. However, there is no shortage of old goods here. Currently, the old goods of large and medium dried mussels are priced at 76 yuan, and the next best are priced at 67 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Wenzhou and Ningbo Merchants Temporarily Suspend Orders

Spot transactions remain brisk

East Piece Goods Market recovers in the afternoon

The national cloth market slightly loosens, with rumors of daily incursions into eastern Zhejiang. Consequently, Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants, preparing to purchase various piece goods, have mostly suspended their orders and shipments, awaiting further information via telegrams from the area before making decisions. However, Shenzhuang shops (local cloth dealers) are generally unwilling to extend credit or add to existing orders. Information on goods being prepared for eastern Zhejiang and various locations in Hunan and Jiangxi is currently quiet. Trends for white cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth are slightly weakening, with prices dropping approximately five cents per piece. Bleached and printed fabrics maintain stable sales. Trading on this street is particularly active, with over two hundred cases of printed satin, crepe de chine, ramie yarn, printed cloth, ramie textiles, poplin, bleached cloth, and foreign yarn sold. Cantonese merchants purchased fifty bales of fine twill and fine cloth, over one hundred cases of colored cloth and colored twill, and over eighty cases of bleached cloth, poplin, bleached fine twill, and standard cloth.

The fine cloth and fine twill market in East Piece Goods experienced a sharp decline in the morning. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth once fell to 11.85 yuan, a plunge of twenty cents per piece. Local customers, sensing market weakness, were hesitant to buy. Later, Tianjin merchants received telegrams stating that yarn prices in Tianjin had skyrocketed by over twenty yuan and that cloth was also looking good. Consequently, orders for over one thousand pieces of fine cloth and fine twill for future delivery were placed, boosting market sentiment. Sales prices for various brands rebounded and strengthened. "Dragon Head" fine cloth was again selling above twelve yuan, and fine twill even exceeded the previous day's market price by about five cents. Japanese trading companies were particularly eager, acquiring four to five hundred pieces of "Dragon Head" and "Color Ball" brand fine cloth.

Today's piece goods exports: six cases to Xiamen, sixty-five cases to Quanzhou, two hundred and ten cases to Ningbo, and four hundred and ten cases to Tianjin.

### Woolen Fabrics: Brisk Spring Sales

The woolen fabric trade was very busy yesterday, as it is the peak season for spring sales. Demand from various sectors has suddenly increased. Tailors, Western clothing stores, custom clothing makers, and retail cutters have all seen daily increases in business. Merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Beiping, Tianjin, and other regions are inquiring about summer goods, leading to increased postal shipments. Light gray colors are the most popular for all goods.

### Silk and Tea: Rapid Fluctuations in Japanese and American Silk Markets

Local businesses actively pursue the New York market

The local silk market is unusually sluggish. Both foreign and domestic sales, as well as hoarding, are minimal. Overall, people are hesitant and taking a wait-and-see approach. Although the Japanese and American markets are experiencing rapid fluctuations, the impact on the Shanghai market is minimal. Local silk businesses are actively engaging in short selling and buying long positions on the New York Stock Exchange. The local silk industry has always been more focused on speculation than enterprise, and this has become even more pronounced after the war. Yesterday, spot prices in Yokohama rose by seven yuan, and forward prices rose by fourteen yuan. Near-term prices in New York rose by three cents, and forward prices rose by four and a half cents. Lyon's silk rose by 2.5 French francs, while Shanghai silk fell by half a French franc.

### Metals: Double-Coated Tinplate

Supply cannot meet demand

Recently, double-coated tinplate, whether from England, America, Italy, or Germany, has seen brisk business due to active purchases by Tianjin cigarette manufacturers and strong local factory sales. Consequently, the market lacks available stock, and prices are rising. For example, ninety-pound American double-coated tinplate is selling for seventy yuan, up one yuan. English and German goods are quoted at 65.5 yuan, also up one yuan. One-hundred-pound American goods are selling for eighty-five yuan, and Italian goods are selling for seventy-six yuan. Other English and German goods are priced around seventy-five yuan, about one yuan higher than previous sales prices. With no new stock arriving recently, the market is quite firm. It is estimated that over two hundred cases were sold yesterday by metal shops along North Suzhou Road, mostly to factories, with only a small amount going to merchants.

### Huisheng Iron Continues to Rise Strongly; Italian Ship Brings Two Hundred Cases of Lead Sheet

Due to high demand and limited stock, Huisheng iron prices are rising. Yesterday's prices reached around fifty-six yuan, an increase of more than one yuan. Transactions reached sixty to seventy cases. Two hundred cases of lead sheet arrived from Italy the day before yesterday.

### Coal: Haifeng White Coal Sells Well

White coal is rising both officially and unofficially, as the number of Hongji white coal arrivals is sporadic, and merchant demand remains strong, leading to a supply shortage. Consequently, second-grade coal is also quite active. Yesterday's market saw transactions of over two hundred tons, including Haifeng No. 1 lump coal at forty-seven yuan per ton, No. 2 at forty-six yuan, and mixed coal at forty-four yuan, ex-warehouse, cash transactions.
