### Central Government Seals Telegram from Wang, Temporarily Adopts a Silent Attitude â€“ Various Rumors Are Inaccurate

(Chongqing) Although the central government received the telegram from Wang Zhaoming in Hong Kong on the 7th, which was considered moderate in tone and contained no betrayal, it has not taken active action and is temporarily adopting a silent attitude to observe further developments.

Xu has been transferred to another position to train new troops. The news from Tokyo that Madame Chiang had gone to Hong Kong is also ridiculous.

Editorial

### The Question of Anglo-American Joint Economic Sanctions Against Japan

In recent days, there has been a tendency for Britain and the United States to jointly adopt a tough stance on Japan's attempts to close the door to China. Yesterday, a Reuters dispatch from London stated that Britain and the United States have exchanged views on the Far East issue. Although the content is unknown, according to general observation, the two countries have already made the same decisions based on the same facts. Some retaliatory actions against Japan can be expected to be adopted. The US Congress is currently discussing the issue of sanctions against Japan and neutrality laws that could affect the Sino-Japanese War. British Prime Minister Chamberlain has also stated that his attitude towards the Far East issue will shift with the attitude of the United States. If the amendment to the US sanctions against Japan and the neutrality law can be established, then the currently reported issue of economic retaliation against Japan can immediately become a reality. In the dark and chaotic current situation in the Far East, this action by Britain and the United States will open up a new situation.

Judging from the current situation, the Sino-Japanese War has reached a critical juncture. Britain and the United States want to preserve their rights and interests in the Far East and maintain world justice and peace. Given the current war situation and the domestic environment of Britain and the United States, now is the most appropriate time to impose economic retaliation against Japan. In terms of the Far East, since China entered the second stage of the War of Resistance, its military position has become increasingly favorable, and its political situation has become increasingly clear due to the purging of compromise and wavering elements. If Britain and the United States implement economic retaliation against Japan at this time, it will directly oppose the infringement of rights and interests by fascism, and indirectly strengthen China's strength in the War of Resistance, which will shorten the period for China to achieve final victory. The current Japan is at a loss in the war of aggression against China, and the large outflow of gold, the rapid decline in foreign trade, the rise in prices, and the increase in unemployment have already caused the entire economy to begin to collapse. Now, if Britain and the United States can take this opportunity to impose economic pressure on Japan, it will naturally be enough to force Japan to stop its aggression.

Moreover, Japan's aggressive actions in China, due to the increasingly unfavorable domestic and international situation, are intensifying their efforts to exclude European and American forces in China and expand the scope of aggression. Not long ago, Japan brazenly declared the so-called "establishing a new order in China," and recently there has been the factual manifestation of blockading the ports of North China. Japan's ambitions in the Far East are by no means satisfied with seizing China, as many facts can prove. The Japanese press also openly stated at the end of last year that Japan should seize Hong Kong, Singapore, India, and other places. If Britain and the United States do not take timely measures to prevent the development of Japan's ambitions, once the aggressors are fully developed, not only will Britain and the United States be unable to preserve their rights and interests in China and other countries in the Far East, but it will also be impossible for them to maintain their own peace. This may also be the reason that has prompted them to realize that they must jointly impose economic sanctions on Japan!

In terms of the situation of Britain and the United States themselves, the British public has always held a sympathetic attitude towards China's War of Resistance, while the government has often wanted to compromise with the aggressors from a realistic perspective. However, the British government's compromise policy has ultimately been greatly disappointed. Now, the demands of the general public in Britain for economic sanctions against Japan are very urgent. For example, British expatriates in China have twice telegraphed the government, requesting that they take effective measures to protect their rights and interests in China! Domestic bankers and exporters are also trying to get the government to change its compromise policy. Even the British government has realized that it must change its attitude on Far East policy. They know that Britain's investment of 250 million pounds in China can no longer obtain a safe guarantee from compromise. For example, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, in which Britain has investment relations, has long been operating under the control of the Japanese army. Not only are the British not allowed to intervene, but even British requests to inspect are rejected. This is a good lesson for the British government. Therefore, after US President Roosevelt made a speech criticizing aggressive behavior, British Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately expressed his approval in a written statement and immediately convened cabinet members to consider increasing tariffs on Japanese goods and granting preferential economic treatment to China. This shows that the British government has also recognized that only by adopting economic retaliation measures can they effectively protect their rights and interests in China.

As for the US government and people, they have always had a very enthusiastic support for China's War of Resistance. Although a few isolationists have expressed opposition in the past, they have gradually changed their attitude as the Japanese aggression and atrocities continue to unfold. For example, the amount of military supplies that the United States shipped to aggressive countries in the past was very large, but after US Secretary of State Hull dissuaded them, it has now been greatly reduced. President Roosevelt's amendment to the neutrality law, which he decided to propose in Congress, is undoubtedly a positive expression of support for the work of assisting China. And now it has received the support of general public opinion. The 750,000 members of the American Peace and Democracy Association have jointly written to the government requesting a ban on arms shipments and the suspension of credit loans to aggressive countries, which shows that the US government and people have gradually reached a consensus on the issue of economic retaliation against Japan.

Since the necessity and trend of joint Anglo-American economic retaliation against Japan are now so obvious, the major issue at present is the question of specific implementation methods. We know that the private material profits that general financial capitalists pay attention to may not always be in response to the policies of great statesmen with far-sighted vision. And the close economic relations between various British and American colonies and Japan are sufficient to make economic retaliation difficult in practice. We can only hope that far-sighted statesmen in Britain and the United States, such as Roosevelt, Hull, Eden, and Iri Pengke, will make a few more appeals to the British and American people and mobilize the strength of the masses, which can always be effective!

### Chen Cheng Reports on One Week of War Situation

Chongqing: Chen Cheng reported on one week of war situation (from January 1st to 8th), stating that the enemy's internal social situation is showing signs of unrest. The true face of their outwardly strong but inwardly weak state is about to be revealed. The collapse of the Konoe Cabinet is a sign of this. Therefore, their national warlords are scrambling around, on one hand spreading rumors of peaceful atmosphere, and on the other hand actively mobilizing their long-battled and exhausted soldiers, hoping to cut off our international transportation lines in Guangzhou and Shanxi. However, everyone knows their intentions. They cannot deceive us. Regardless of their strategies, tactics, or political strategies, the more the enemy tries to penetrate our interior, the more difficulties they will face, and the deeper they penetrate, the more beneficial it will be for us. We have infinite power to deal with their petty antics. Now that the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun, the Japanese invaders have penetrated deep into our interior. We will not only prevent them from advancing further, but also launch a general counter-offensive along the entire front, drive the Japanese invaders out of our territory, and restore our beautiful homeland. We hope that people around the world who sympathize with justice will watch with bated breath. The general overview of this week's war situation is recorded as follows: In Guangdong, the main force of the enemy in Guangdong, numbering over 20,000, is still concentrated in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and no active action has been discovered. However, they have been busy building fortifications in the suburbs of Guangzhou, as if they intend to hold Guangzhou firmly. The highway from Huaxian to Taipingchang has been destroyed by the Japanese army, which proves the ugly state of the Japanese army fearing the southward attack of the Chinese army. The Japanese army on the Guangcong Highway was intercepted by a unit of the Chinese attacking team near Shupu in Taipingchang on the afternoon of the 31st, killing a Japanese Lieutenant Noberu and more than twenty soldiers, and seizing many rifles and military supplies. Subsequently, thousands of Japanese troops advanced from Taipingchang to Dagangling Shuicao on the morning of the 1st. More than a hundred people arrived at Shabei Village at noon, three hundred people near Chicao, five hundred people near Dengcun, and over four hundred cavalrymen and artillerymen in the Doger area of Sandong, bombarding the Chinese positions with hundreds of shells to cover the infantry's advance. They fought fiercely with the Chinese army until the morning of the 2nd. The Japanese were defeated and retreated along the highway. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese were killed, and the Chinese casualties were only over twenty. The Japanese troops in Zengcheng and Shetouling were attacked by a Chinese attacking team on the night of the 1st. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted by relying on fortifications. The fierce battle continued until midnight, when the Japanese army in Shetouling was surrounded. Another unit broke into the North Gate of Zengcheng and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. On the morning of the 2nd, a large Japanese force rushed to aid from Shitan Guangzhou. The Chinese army retreated to its original position after the mission was completed. In this battle, the Japanese casualties in Shetouling were over ninety, and more than twenty rifles and other steel helmets and gas masks were seized. In Zengcheng, seventy Japanese troops were killed. In both places, the Chinese army suffered a total of two platoon leaders and more than ten soldiers killed and wounded. On the night of the 1st, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army at the Jiujiang Estuary in Nanhe, seizing two machine guns and over seventy boxes of gasoline. The Japanese suffered more than ten casualties. In short, the Japanese army on the periphery of Guangzhou suffered attacks from all directions by the Chinese army on the day of the New Year's Day alone, suffering heavy losses and experiencing a lot of fluster. As for Beihai Weizhou Island, three Japanese warships arrived, including an aircraft carrier. Three hundred Japanese soldiers have landed on Weizhou Island, committing adultery, looting, and doing all kinds of evil, causing the people to suffer unspeakably.

### Wen Zongyao's Declaration is Not Worth Arguing Against

(Chongqing) Regarding the declaration made by Wen Zongyao, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan of the Reorganized National Government, demanding that the people accept Konoe's peace proposal, the Chinese government spokesman stated that this fact is not worth commenting on. Wen is known as the most corrupt official of the former Beijing government era. He is an opium addict himself, and his daughter is a woman of ill-repute who was arrested in New York a few years ago for trafficking drugs from Shanghai to the United States. Therefore, any declaration made by Wen is not worth arguing against. The Chinese government is determined to continue the war of resistance. The spokesman further pointed out that the "Reorganized National Government's" claim that its judicial power has reached twelve provinces of mainland China is a deceptive tale. In fact, its judicial power cannot extend beyond the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai, and even the New Asia Hotel is under the protection of the Japanese army. (Eleventh Day, Associated Press)

### The Soviet Union Will Not Take Unilateral Action in the Far East; There Are Three Conditions for War Against Japan; Hope China Cooperates with Britain and the United States; Sun Ke Talks About the Bright Future of the War of Resistance

(Chongqing) Sun Ke, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, stated in a speech here yesterday that the Soviet Union has not yet taken any unilateral military action against Japan to aid China's war of resistance. The reasons for this are no more than the following: First, China did not conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union before the war; Second, the Soviet Union's established policy is to obtain peace through collective security. After criticizing those who hoped that Germany and Italy would mediate the Sino-Japanese War, Sun added that our country's foreign policy is an open policy, that is, to closely cooperate with Britain, the United States, and France. In fact, the Soviet Union also hopes that our country will closely cooperate with Britain, the United States, and France. If the Soviet Union takes unilateral action, it will give Japan an opportunity to prove that its invasion of China is an effort to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating the Far East. Furthermore, it may arouse the suspicion of Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, if the democratic countries cannot form a unified front, the Soviet Union will not take unilateral action in the Far East. Sun finally urged the Chinese people to have faith and determination, and to rely on their own abilities to resist Japanese aggression. (Eleventh Day, Reuters)

(Chongqing) Sun Ke, Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, gave a speech here on January 7, revealing many facts that have not been publicly announced in Sino-Soviet relations in the past two years. According to reports, the Soviet Union agreed to go to war with Japan under the following three conditions: (1) The League of Nations implements sanctions against Japan. Since the Soviet Union is a member state of the League of Nations, it will naturally fulfill its obligations. (2) If the League of Nations cannot implement sanctions, then there must be a joint understanding between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly resist Japanese military. (3) If the powers cannot reach an understanding, then the Soviet Union can only go to war with Japan if Japan invades Soviet territory. Sun also stated that the former Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, submitted three proposals to the Chinese government when he returned to China from Moscow before the outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident: (1) China proposes to convene a Pacific Peace Conference; (2) China and the Soviet Union sign a treaty of non-aggression; (3) China and the Soviet Union sign a mutual assistance agreement. After careful consideration, the Chinese government believed that the Pacific Peace Conference would not be very effective because Japan might not participate. Later, due to the outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the proposal to convene a Pacific Peace Conference was naturally canceled. The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in August 1937, but negotiations on the Sino-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement have not yet begun, because the conclusion of this agreement before the war is completely different from the situation after the war. If the mutual assistance agreement had been concluded before the Lugou Bridge Incident, it could have prevented the war. But after the war, this agreement would immediately force the Soviet Union to fight Japan. Last year, as the European situation became increasingly tense, the Soviet Union could not fight on both the eastern and western fronts at the same time, so it had to adopt a less active policy in the Far East, and its assistance to China could only be limited to spiritual diplomacy and material aspects. Sun continued to express his belief in China's final victory, saying that at the time of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the total number of Chinese troops was only one million, but now it has increased to 240 divisions. When the Chinese and Japanese armies fought near Shanghai, the ratio of casualties was five to one. The Battle of Xuzhou has been reduced to a ratio of three to one. In the Yangtze River Campaign, the ratio of casualties on both sides is almost equal. In the guerrilla warfare in North China, the ratio of casualties between the two armies is three to one for the enemy and one for us. As for the Shanxi Province, this ratio is even more favorable to China, that is, for every one of us who dies, the enemy must suffer fourteen and a half casualties. (Eleventh Day, Reuters)

### Two Foreigners Kidnapped Near the Ming Xiaoling Tomb in Beiping; Italian Postal Director and a Russian Woman; After Being Kidnapped, the Bandits Demanded a Ransom of 30,000 Yuan

(Beiping) The Italian postal director of the Beiping district, Pu Lai Di, a Russian woman, and three Chinese servants were kidnapped near Ming Mausoleum. The bandits then released one of the Chinese servants and demanded a ransom of 30,000 yuan. According to reports, this case occurred 25 miles from Beiping, only an arrow's throw away from the Japanese garrison. (Eleventh Day, Reuters)

### Britain and the United States Have Already Made Positive Indications of Aiding China; American Sympathy for China is Increasingly Obvious; Naval Expansion Will Soon be Completed

(Hong Kong) A certain diplomat who has just returned from the United States told our reporter that the American government and the public have clearly shown sympathy for us, and the attitude of the bourgeoisie has also become stronger because (1) Japan excludes American interests in China, and (2) Japan's cash reserves have decreased by three-quarters and are no longer the best customers. In the future, Britain and the United States will further cooperate, because the British-American business has been signed, and the war debt problem has recently been resolved. Therefore, they will adopt parallel policies and will not shirk each other. This can already be seen in general in the loan to China. In terms of naval cooperation, it is even more worthy of deep belief. Britain has decided to set up a Far East Fleet and strengthen the Singapore base. The United States has also set up an independent Pacific Fleet, but the formation of a fleet must include 125 to 136 warships of all levels. The British and American naval expansion plans will be completed within two or three years. At that time, Japan can be dealt with arbitrarily. Why should we actively seek peace? Even if Britain and the United States want to help us, there is not enough time. (Eleventh Day, 11:00 PM Special Dispatch)

### Sexual Hygiene: Premature Aging - Methods to Enhance Energy in Severe Winter

â€”Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science from Russian Labour University

Many men, due to ignorance of hygiene or bad habits, weaken their metabolic functions, leading to a decline in spirit and body despite their relatively young age. The condition known as kidney deficiency is often a result of premature aging. In theory, young men should have abundant primordial yang energy and should not experience such problems. However, due to indulgence and excessive desires, their reproductive capacity gradually declines while they are still young. They are unable to exert their full energy, which is a symptom of kidney deficiency.

Normally, this unfortunate phenomenon occurs after middle age due to the natural decline in physiology, leading to the aging of the sex glands. Generally, a healthy male's sex glands are highly active around the age of twenty, but by middle age, their strength wanes and they become ineffective. However, if hygiene is neglected, this condition can develop even before middle age, which is a tragedy.

Therefore, if the essence of the sex glands (i.e., the testicles) of a strong animal can be introduced into the human body, it can promote their activity, relieve premature aging, restore their original energy, and achieve rejuvenation. This is the latest invention in modern medicine: organ therapy.

For example, a forty-year-old man who feels his energy declining can delay the onset of these issues by at least ten years through this therapy. Clinical results have proven its effectiveness.

Youth Gland Extract, "Bu Ti Kang" for men, has a long history of use in organ therapy. We doctors have correctly recognized its medicinal power. The effects begin within one hour, and it invigorates the kidneys within 24 hours, providing several major functions such as activating the nerves and tonifying the kidneys, blood, and brain. Whether the patient suffers from premature ejaculation, neurasthenia, premature aging, underdevelopment, or infertility after marriage, "Bu Ti Kang" can restore youthful vigor. Out of a thousand cases, there are almost no disappointments.

Premature aging and kidney deficiency can not only weaken the love between couples, but also lead to lifelong infertility if suffered early in life.

Reproductive ability is directly proportional to health. Therefore, people with premature aging and kidney deficiency should actively take Youth Gland Extract, "Bu Ti Kang" for men, to not only exert healthy reproductive power but also gradually improve their overall health.

### Harmless Home Remedies for Nocturnal Emission

The earlier one is infected with the bad habit of masturbation, the deeper the damage. The more frequent the bad habit, the more severe the physical and mental damage. After excessive masturbation, frequent nocturnal emissions and the essence and blood produced by physiology are not sufficient for new metabolism, and the brain, sex organs, and spinal cord suffer from hundreds of neurological diseases, resulting in memory loss, headaches, tinnitus, palpitations, lack of energy, premature ejaculation, impotence, and lower back pain. If one indulges in masturbation during development, one may lose the ability to develop properly.

Nocturnal emission from masturbation is not an incurable disease. If the symptoms are mild and there are no adverse effects, they will automatically disappear after marriage. If there is excessive masturbation or frequent spermatorrhea and nocturnal emissions, it should be treated quickly. First, it is especially important to abstain from masturbation, engage in noble games, clear the mind and reduce desires. It is very easy to correct the bad habit of masturbation. Then, take "Nai Er Si Anti-Spermatorrhea Tablets", three tablets each night before bed with warm water, to stop nocturnal emission that night. At the same time, use Youth Gland Extract, "Bu Ti Kang" for men, made from testicular essence, to nourish the losses. Pay attention to health, and you can restore your original health within a short period of time. This home remedy is not only economical and simple, but also effective and harmless.

### Do Not Be Penny Wise and Pound Foolish

â€” Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

The claim of curing leucorrhea in a few days has been shattered by the facts.

Recently, the treatment of common gonorrhea has become confusing. Due to my clinical duties, patients often seek my treatment, and most of them tell me that they were misled by over-the-counter medicines that claim to cure in three to five days. After taking one or two courses, it is still like throwing a stone into the sea, losing money without benefit, and the pain is even deeper. It is really a case of being penny wise and pound foolish. In reality, they are still made of old and inferior materials, such as cubeb and sandalwood oil. They are disguised with the name of some new ingredient, truly attempting to "resurrect the dead." In fact, these patients, who have no medical knowledge, do not think about how gonorrhea can be cured in three to five days. Even with the "606" for syphilis, it is impossible to eradicate it in three to five days. We say that there are effective medicines for gonorrhea that can be cured. However, to say that these effective medicines can cure it completely in three to five days is nothing but deception. Fortunately, the inferior over-the-counter medicines that claim to cure in a few days have been shattered by these ironclad facts. There is no room for hesitation.

Now we are guiding patients towards the path of light with accurate scientific knowledge. Among the internal medicines for gonorrhea that are tested by time, "Ke Lin Nong," invented by Dr. Peter, a master of gonorrhea from Germany, is the most effective. Because Dr. Peter, with his natural talent and hard work, spent more than 30 years of research, based on the principle of non-specific therapy, invented and adopted a protein-chromophore mixture to make "Ke Lin Nong." Its efficacy has been precisely analyzed and tested by Dr. Hi Hare, a famous clinical experimentalist of gonorrhea. He knows that after each gonorrhea patient takes "Ke Lin Nong," the cells are stimulated by the medicinal power of "Ke Lin Nong," which produces a subtle effect of anti-gonorrhea and sterilization. Therefore, whether it is the initial stage of gonorrhea or those who have not been cured by taking other gonorrhea medicines for a long time, taking "Ke Lin Nong" can definitely cure it. However, it is not comparable to ordinary over-the-counter medicines. Because "Ke Lin Nong" is determined by the severity of the condition and the depth of the disease to determine its cure period, not generally saying that it can be cured in three to five days, because the correct gonorrhea special medicine can not make unreasonable publicity. It must be shown to people with the word "efficacy" in order to convince the patients, because facts speak louder than words. We cannot use deceptive words like hanging sheep's heads and selling dog meat to try the patients.

### Gonorrhea Rhapsody

â€” Dr. Yao Juyan, Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

How can one say that leucorrhea is completely cured?

Treating gonorrhea should not miss a single thing.

Treating a kind of sexually transmitted disease, an experienced physician will not only take care of the patient's own condition, but also make complete preparations for their relatives. For example, a married man who has gonorrhea will find it difficult for his wife to remain celibate and avoid the ravages of gonorrhea, because gonorrhea is highly contagious and can be transmitted even with occasional contact. How can couples who sleep in the same bed avoid the attack of gonorrhea? Therefore, at this time, the physician must give the patient moral guidance. If, unfortunately, both husband and wife are infected, it is better to treat them at the same time, so that there is no omission, repeated infections, and it will be difficult to cure. Therefore, the only solution must be to treat both parties at the same time. For example, the man has completely cured gonorrhea, but does not pay attention to his wife's gonorrhea, and then becomes infected again due to sexual relations.

Husband and wife can only cohabit if they are free of poison.

According to our experience, dealing with such gender-specific gonorrhea is not difficult. Whether it is the initial stage of gonorrhea in men, or a long-term history of more than ten years of gonorrhea, you can generally choose German X-rays or anti-gonorrhea serum, and electrostatic therapy, and use gonorrhea "Ke Lin Nong" as a necessary internal medicine. In the statistics of our clinical experiments, taking "Ke Lin Nong" for three to five weeks will have the effect of overcoming the Qin Dynasty and fundamentally curing it. In addition to taking "Ke Lin Nong," women with gonorrhea can also externally use "Ka Er Di vaginal tablets" as suppositories to remove vaginal discharge and gonococcus, which can also be radically cured in three weeks. It must be proved that both parties are free of gonorrhea before they can be called completely cured and allowed to cohabit. Diagnosis is from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. From today, 20 numbers will be given out every day, and each number will only cost five corners.

### Pulmonary Disease Response Strategies

Recent scientific advances have led to rapid progress in medicine and pharmacology. Likewise, treatments for pulmonary diseases have made significant strides. The drug "Bu Fei Na Er" (è¡¥è‚ºæ‹¿å°” - roughly translates to "Lung Nourishing Nall"), for example, was invented as a result of scientific impetus. This formula has proven to be effective in the short term for all stages of pulmonary disease and can gradually shrink cavities in the lungs, eventually returning them to a normal state. Therefore, "Bu Fei Na Er" is considered the premier oral medicine for tuberculosis and pulmonary disease. This is by no means an overstatement. Furthermore, it is also effective for elderly asthma, restless nights, and infantile pertussis (whooping cough). Its ability to nourish the lungs and combat consumption far surpasses that of various cod liver oils. This is generally acknowledged by Chinese and foreign medical professionals, hence its leading position among pulmonary disease medications.

### Before Economic Retaliation Against Japan, Britain Intends to Issue a Final Note. Significant Internal Difficulties Still Exist Regarding Retaliation Methods. Before the American Ambassador Returns Home, Arita Intends to Lobby Him Again.

(London) Newspapers continue to report that the British government is preparing to take active measures in the near future to protect British interests in China. The Birmingham Post stated that after Parliament reconvenes, the government will announce steps to safeguard British interests in the Far East. However, credible sources indicate this statement lacks accuracy. The Financial News reported that the British government is carefully considering two approaches: direct assistance to the Chinese government in the form of monetary loans, and implementing a plan that would have a more direct impact on Japan's commerce and finance than on China's resistance efforts. However, the government is reluctant to impose general restrictions on Japanese imports into Britain. According to Reuters, part of the difficulty the British government faces in commercial retaliation is opposition from metal and wool textile industries in the self-governing dominions that trade with Japan. It is reported that Washington is also being hindered by the oil, cotton waste, iron scrap and machinery industries. However, one thing is undoubtedly certain: the British government's attitude is becoming increasingly firm, and there is a growing sense that mere diplomatic protests will be fruitless. Britain's assistance to China is legally unassailable. It is believed that the British government will first send Japan a detailed note similar to the one issued by the United States on December 31 as a final effort to persuade Japan to respect British rights and interests before implementing more stringent plans to directly protect British interests in the Far East. (Reuters, 11th)

Washington: The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the Senate and House of Representatives are scheduled to meet within days to discuss economic sanctions and amendments to the Neutrality Act. Regarding the former, some members of Congress now advocate using economic sanctions against Japan. Democratic Senator Pittman (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) stated, "If one can force someone to respect your rights through starvation, why necessarily execute them?" Republican Senator Borah (former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) expressed opposition, stating, "Economic sanctions are by no means a peaceful measure, but a preliminary step to war. If I am not prepared to fight, I should not implement sanctions." It remains to be seen which faction will prevail when the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses begin their discussions. (Havas, 10th)

(Nanjing) The Guomin News reported this morning that Foreign Minister Arita will ask U.S. Ambassador Grew to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a discussion before departing for home, in order to reiterate Japan's policy toward China. He will use this opportunity to point out the unfortunate situation that continued U.S. assistance to the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek will cause, and the possibility that this will lead Japan to reconsider its promise to respect U.S. rights in China. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today responded to a question from a foreign reporter on this matter, saying that he had not heard of the news reported in the Guomin News, but that it was quite possible that Ambassador Grew would visit Foreign Minister Arita before departing for home. (Reuters, 11th)

### Is a World War Inevitable This Spring? U.S. Ambassadors to Britain and France Submit Confidential Reports Advocating That the United States Must Step Up Preparations.

(Washington) The Armed Services Committees of both the Senate and House of Representatives held a closed joint session yesterday. According to a member present, Ambassador Kennedy to Britain reported on the European situation, stating that "a world war may occur this spring." Ambassador Bullitt to France also reported at the meeting and agreed with Kennedy. Kennedy also predicted that the war would break out due to German aggression in Ukraine or Italian attempts to seize Tunisia. Kennedy also submitted to the committee information on the strength of the German air force, compiled by Colonel Lindbergh. It stated that Germany currently has 10,000 first-line aircraft and can produce 1,200 new aircraft per month. Kennedy continued, saying that all of this is enough to provide a lesson in "preparation." According to congressmen who attended, Kennedy and Bullitt presented a step-by-step account of European affairs from the Munich Conference to the previous month, detailing the trends in European affairs. Their words were very moving and presented a truly somber atmosphere for peace. Another committee member stated that the two ambassadors' remarks covered some aspects of British and French foreign policy and some opportunities for "appeasing" Mussolini and Hitler. The two ambassadors seemed to have little hope for the future of Europe. The two diplomats spoke for about two hours. According to reliable sources, they did not make any recommendations to increase U.S. national defense, but only reported in detail the current state of complete chaos in Europe. Democratic Senator Reynolds, who attended the meeting, reportedly plans to deliver a speech in the Senate within days, exposing everything said in yesterday's closed meeting. Upon hearing this, the others were shocked. It appears that his colleagues will advise him not to do so. Committee members stated that they had briefly discussed Colonel Lindbergh's report on the strength of the German air force. The U.S. government was fortunate to receive this report, but much of what was said had already been known to military observers. Lindbergh merely confirmed it. As the members of the two committees left the meeting, they all wore expressions of concern. One member said, "The British Empire and France are currently facing an extremely serious crisis." If this meeting has indeed served the purpose anticipated by most people, which is to facilitate President Roosevelt's grand arms program, it seems to have been particularly effective. (Reuters, 11th)

(Washington) Some committee members said that the ambassadors stated that Germany currently has 1,000 first-line aircraft and can build an average of 200 per month. Ambassador Kennedy also presented and read a report prepared by the famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh on the strength of the German air force. (Havas, 10th)

(Washington) The Armed Services Committees of both the Senate and House of Representatives held a secret joint meeting today, listening to reports from Ambassador Kennedy to Britain and Ambassador Bullitt to France on the European situation, especially on the military preparations of European countries, in order to decide on the U.S. defense plan. It is uncommon for ambassadors to report to the Armed Services Committees. The meeting lasted for two hours, and all committee members were present to listen attentively. According to well-informed sources, the ambassadors stated that the European situation has become tense due to the attitudes of German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Political figures said that the ambassadors were supporting the defense message that President Roosevelt was about to present. (Havas, 10th)

(New York) According to the results of a survey conducted by the American Institute of Public Opinion, the American people generally agree with President Roosevelt's criticism of the actions of the dictatorships. At the same time, the number of Americans dissatisfied with Germany is increasing daily. Before Germany annexed Austria, most people were neutral towards Hitler, believing that the United States should not interfere in European disputes, accounting for 62 percent of the total. After the German-Austrian union, the number of Americans who believed that the United States would eventually fight Germany accounted for 46 percent of the total. Later, after the Czech problem was resolved, Hitler issued a statement saying, "Germany no longer has territorial ambitions in Europe." At that time, 92 percent of Americans did not want to believe it. Until recently, the Institute of Public Opinion again surveyed public opinion on the issue of boycotting German goods, and the results showed that 61 percent voted in favor. The increasing anti-German sentiment among Americans is evident from this. (Havas, 10th)

### Britain Plans to Build Extremely Fast Aircraft

(London) The Air Ministry is currently designing and manufacturing a Spitfire monoplane equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, capable of speeds exceeding 500 miles per hour. Test flights are scheduled for March of this year. The world record for aircraft speed is currently 440 miles per hour, set by an Italian aircraft. (Havas, 11th)

### Rome's Friendly and Enthusiastic Atmosphere Welcomes Chamberlain. A Wide Range of Issues Discussed. British and French Views Are Completely Aligned.

(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax arrived here at 4:25 p.m. today. Prime Minister Mussolini arrived at the station at 4:15 p.m. to greet them. (Reuters, 11th)

(Rome) Although the reception for British Prime Minister Chamberlain and others is not as extravagant as the reception for German leader Hitler, there is a genuine atmosphere of friendship and enthusiasm. Officials have not yet commented on the events to be discussed by both sides. However, according to local sources, although reports from London suggest that the talks will be of a general nature, they will ultimately have to address specific issues such as Franco-Italian relations, the Spanish problem, Italian colonial aspirations, the administration of the Suez Canal, the resolution of the Jewish question, and Anglo-Italian commercial relations. These are all issues that will be discussed by both sides. The first formal welcome to the British delegation will take place in Turin this morning at 8:00 a.m. The special train carrying the British delegation is expected to arrive in Genoa at around 10:00 a.m., where they will be welcomed by Italian military and civilian authorities. At 4:20 p.m. in the afternoon, the British delegation will arrive in Rome, where Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and other Italian cabinet members and British embassy staff will gather at the station to greet them. Rome Station is decorated with flowers and national flags. The British representatives will ride in seven cars along the streets lined with soldiers to the Madama Hotel, designated by the Italian government to accommodate the guests. The first car will be occupied by the British Prime Minister and the Italian Foreign Minister. (Reuters, 11th)

(Paris) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax arrived here last night by special train. The station was adorned with the flags of both countries and covered with red carpets. French Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, British Ambassador Phipps, and British Embassy staff were all at the station to greet them. As the British delegation traveled by car to the French Foreign Ministry, the crowds welcomed them and waved their handkerchiefs in salute. After arriving at the Foreign Ministry, the British delegation had refreshments and then began political talks. In addition to Chamberlain and Halifax, the British side included British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan and Ingram, as well as Ambassador to France Phipps. The French side included Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry LÃ©ger, Chief Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Rochat, and Ministry member BrÃ©art. It is believed that the French cabinet members first presented their views on Italian demands during the talks, and the British cabinet members expressed their complete agreement. What they wanted to say in Rome was conveyed to the French cabinet members, who had no objections. According to political sources here, the visit of the British cabinet members to Rome is not intended to issue any special declarations, but only to hear Italy's views, as Italy's views have always been kept secret. However, if Italy seeks Britain's opinion, Chamberlain and Halifax will offer beneficial steps to Italy: first, to ease the situation in the Mediterranean, Italy should completely withdraw its troops from Spain; second, if Italy wants to resolve matters directly with France, it can contact France directly and cancel its newspaper propaganda and clamor. If so, Italy may be able to turn Djibouti, the capital of French Somaliland, into a free port. Political circles now believe that the principle of the Rome talks is that nothing is gained without something given. (Reuters, 11th)

(Paris) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax arrived at the Gare du Nord station in this capital this afternoon. Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, and many other French dignitaries welcomed them at the station. The British and French cabinet members then drove to the Foreign Ministry amidst the cheers of the crowd to attend a tea party and conduct talks, which lasted for one hour and ten minutes. Afterwards, according to an official press release, British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, en route to Italy, met with Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris. They exchanged views and fully confirmed that their opinions were in agreement. (Havas, 10th)

(Paris) At yesterday's cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Bonnet announced that he had recently sent a note, with precise and complete wording, stating France's views on Italian demands, to the British Ambassador for transmission to the British government. After Bonnet read this note, the cabinet members unanimously approved the clear and firm position taken by France. (Reuters, 11th)

(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax are scheduled to arrive here this afternoon. All newspapers have published this news on their front pages and issued editorials expressing their welcome, stating that Prime Minister Chamberlain is a contributor to promoting friendship between Britain and Italy. The Rome People's News reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain and Prime Minister Mussolini are very close friends, and once said that "a policy of action is truly a madness in the heat of summer. What he did last September not only met human expectations, but also recently put the Anglo-Italian agreement into practice. His prestige in Italy is above that of all foreign politicians, and it is appropriate. The Envoy's News reported that we are entering a historical era, and there are urgent tasks that cannot be delayed. We must move forward with a decisive resolution and a thorough approach. It is well known that his actions are also very open and aboveboard. As the British cabinet members come to visit, we will put aside the specific issues for now and sincerely welcome them." (Havas, 11th)

(Rome) As the British and Italian cabinet members are about to hold talks, the semi-official Italian Daily recently explained Italy's wishes, stating that the evolution of bilateral relations will depend on how the Spanish issue is resolved. "Italy has honestly stated its position on this matter and will certainly bring this issue to a fair and equitable conclusion." In addition, the British and Italian cabinet members should also discuss general European issues. "The various demands recently made by Italy do not threaten the interests of Britain and other countries in Europe or elsewhere, and are necessary for the peaceful order of Europe. Italy will certainly assert its claims resolutely in due course, in an appropriate manner, and with a sense of national dignity, but will not resort to fruitless expressions. Prime Minister Chamberlain must understand this. It is hoped that after the talks between Britain and Italy, both Franco-Italian relations and major European issues can be determined and an understanding can be established with a realistic spirit, thereby promoting positive cooperation. Once the legitimate needs of Germany and Italy have been met, the German-Italian axis will contribute to European peace." (Havas, 11th)

### Strange Sounds in the New York Sky

Brooklyn: Last night, residents of Brooklyn, New York, were greatly alarmed by a series of mysterious sounds in the sky. Police received more than 400 phone calls from residents and rushed to the scene, where they saw frightened residents, many dressed in pajamas, looking up at the cloudy sky. According to those who heard the strange sounds, the sounds came from the clouds, like the rattling of distant airplanes, with the sound waves fluctuating high and low, but they all asserted that they did not come from airplanes or other objects they were familiar with. The strange sounds lasted for about half an hour before disappearing. (Reuters, 11th)

### Germany's Eastern Expansion Plan Will Not Violate Polish Territory. It Is Reported That Hitler Has Assured the Polish Foreign Minister. The German Foreign Minister Has Been Invited to Visit Poland in February or March.

(London) The Daily Telegraph's Warsaw correspondent reports that Polish Foreign Minister Beck, during his talks in Berchtesgaden and Munich last week, obtained assurances from Hitler that his Eastern European plans are not directly hostile to Poland. This means that Germany and Poland will not be hostile to each other in the short term. Unless British Prime Minister Chamberlain's trip to Rome causes a sudden change in his current views, Hitler's intention seems to be to extend Germany's political and economic influence to the Soviet border, but without crossing Polish territory. The northern countries of Latvia and Estonia and the southern country of Romania all have points of contact with the Soviet Union, so there is no need to touch Polish territory. The road to Bessarabia also passes through Carpathian Ukraine and Ruthenia in eastern Czechoslovakia. During the Berchtesgaden meeting, Germany seemed to believe that its Eastern European plan, after obtaining Poland's goodwill, could be realized through strong diplomatic action and with the full support of the German propaganda machine. (Reuters, 11th)

(Berlin) Responsible sources recently announced that Polish Foreign Minister Beck, while passing through Germany yesterday, invited Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to visit Warsaw. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop immediately accepted and will travel in February or March of this year. No date has been set. (Havas, 10th)

(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also plans to visit Warsaw, probably after the German Foreign Minister's trip. (Reuters, 11th)

### Swedish Parliament Reconvenes

Stockholm, Sweden: The House of Representatives recently reconvened this month. King Gustav V personally presided over the opening ceremony and read the royal address, stating that Sweden maintains good relations with all countries and is strengthening cooperation with the Nordic countries (Norway, Denmark, and Finland). The naval treaty recently concluded with Britain will be submitted to the House of Representatives for approval. The proposed amendments to the League of Nations Covenant, which aim to separate the Covenant from the various peace treaties of the European War, will also be submitted for approval. In addition, the House of Representatives will be asked to approve special funding to strengthen national defense, especially to build two warships and purchase various military equipment. The budget revenue for the next year does not need to raise taxes or import tariffs in order to maintain balance. (Havas, 11th)

### Russo-Polish Trade Agreement to be Signed in Moscow

(Moscow) Commercial negotiations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which began in December of last year, have now been completed and a formal trade agreement will be signed here around the 19th of this month. Li Chonoski, Director of the Trade Agreement Department of the Polish Ministry of Commerce, is scheduled to lead a delegation to this country in the near future to sign the agreement with Soviet representatives, namely, Mikoian, Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Trade. According to this trade agreement, the Soviet Union will purchase 70,000,000 to 80,000,000 zÅ‚oty worth of goods from Poland each year, with textiles accounting for 25 percent. The two sides also plan to negotiate a transit agreement for goods. This trade agreement was originally scheduled to be signed in Warsaw, but it has now been changed to Moscow. The reason for this change is said to be that Poland feared that the Soviet Union sending high-ranking officials to Warsaw would provoke an excessive reaction from Germany, so it advocated signing the agreement in Moscow. Poland is willing to continue to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and wants to maintain a balance between Germany and the Soviet Union. (Havas, 11th)

### Britain Invents New Type of Torpedo Boat

(London) British engineer Penner recently invented a type of torpedo boat, which was recently tested in the waters off the Chatham Dockyard. This boat is equipped with three 1,000-horsepower engines, and its speed can increase from 10 knots to 40 knots per hour in eight seconds. Its cruising range is 1,000 nautical miles, and it is equipped with two 21-inch torpedo tubes or four 18-inch torpedo tubes, as well as three small guns. One of the guns fires shells that can penetrate the hulls of destroyers and submarines. The Netherlands and Sweden are reported to have ordered several. (Havas, 10th)

### Ambassador Johnson Praises the Burma Road After Passing Through Britain on His Way Back to the United States. Greatly Surprised by Wang Jingwei's Actions. No Tendency Toward Compromise in Chongqing.

(London) Before U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson departed on the French ship ÃŽle de France today, he met with a Reuters reporter and spoke about the Burma Road, saying that it only took 12 days for a car to travel from Chongqing to Burma. The road surface is quite good and level, and the road is wide enough for two cars to drive side by side. The width is currently being expanded. Initially, part of the road was washed away by heavy rain, but it was later rebuilt, and the project was more solid than before. The original wooden bridges have been replaced with stone bridges. As far as he could see, this road could be used by any heavy-duty vehicle. The road construction employed a total of 150,000 people, using oxen to pull stone rollers to flatten the road surface. There are now hotels with European-style facilities along the road, and warning signs are erected at every bend in the road or where attention is needed. Johnson arrived in Marseille from Rangoon on a British flying boat, saying that the trip was extremely comfortable. Johnson did not discuss political issues, only saying that he was greatly surprised by Wang Jingwei's peace movement, because he had never seen this tendency when he was in Chongqing. (Reuters, 11th)

(London) U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson arrived here yesterday. Although officials strongly stated that Johnson's visit to Britain was purely private, political figures generally believe that Johnson's visit is related to the "economic movement to boycott Japan" that Britain and the United States are planning. It is expected that the U.S. Ambassador will meet with business tycoons related to Chinese commerce, or even conduct discussions with political leaders, and then take a ship back to the United States to report on the Far Eastern situation to President Roosevelt.

### Military Training for Soviet Workers

(Moscow) Soviet workers are now mostly engaged in military training in their spare time. Factories, workshops, collective farms, government agencies, schools, etc. have organized tens of thousands of driver teams, shooting teams, hand grenade teams, parachute teams, aviation teams, medical teams, air defense teams, etc. In Leningrad alone, 327,000 people have joined the Aviation and Chemical Defense Association and the various training teams mentioned above. The hand grenade throwing movement is very popular among Soviet youth. A nationwide hand grenade throwing competition will be held from January 15 to February 1, with 15,000 participants. Not long ago, the machine gun teams of the various agencies of the Ukrainian Aviation and Chemical Defense Association held a competition, with more than 5,000 participants. The machine gun team of a female tractor driver team performed extremely well, scoring a perfect 50 points. The leader of the team is a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. (TASS, 10th)

### German and Italian Japanese Forces Develop in America: Conducting Military Preparations

(Washington) The Pan-American Conference on Democracy was held here yesterday. Professor Afranio do Amaral of Rio de Janeiro (an Argentinian) declared that Germany, Italy, and Japan are currently conducting military preparations in North and South America. He presented documents proving the activities of National Socialists and Fascists in Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and several other countries. He also stated that Argentina now has terrorist organizations, and that a "German naval base" is located at the port of Malabrigo on the coast of Peru. The border of this concession area is guarded by National Socialist sentries. The professor also accused German and Italian diplomats of attempting to control the Argentine education system, stating that students in German colonies are now wearing National Socialist uniforms and wearing swastika badges. Similar situations exist in Uruguay and Chile. He knows that Italy has transported artillery and machine guns into Peruvian territory near the Ecuadorian border. The National Socialists control Colombia's airlines, which is the largest airline group in South America. Colombian hunters have shot down carrier pigeons with messages attached to their feet regarding the defenses of the Panama Canal. Germany is secretly transporting large quantities of arms to staff stationed in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Japan's incursion is encountering no obstacles. (Reuters, 11th)

New York The New York Times recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Guatemala City, Central America, stating that the German government has appointed Hencke as commercial counselor to the embassies of various Central American countries. Americans believe that Germany's commercial and political activities in Central American countries can be seen in this move. (Havas, 10th)

New York The New York Times recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in San JosÃ©, Costa Rica, stating that, according to a manager of a coffee exporting company, the German government has promised to ship high-current generators to Costa Rica in exchange for the country's coffee production. Coffee is in short supply in Germany, with each person only allowed to purchase 125 grams at a time. (Havas, 11th)

### 300,000 Germans Request Entry to America: Jews Comprise 60%

(Washington) Government officials here have received reports that 300,000 Germans are awaiting permission from the US authorities to depart for America. Due to the severe anti-Jewish laws in Germany, they are unable to live there peacefully. Sixty percent of those seeking entry permits are Jewish. Since the passage of the Immigration Act in 1924, there has never been such a large number of applicants. According to regulations, only 27,370 Germans are allowed to enter the US each year. If all current applicants are approved, it would take eleven years to process them. Since 1929, the number of Germans entering the US each year has been lower than the quota. 1938 was the first year in many years that the quota was filled. The four US consulates in Germany are currently processing passport applications day and night, and are extremely busy, so they have requested additional staff. The authorities here have dispatched several consular officials and clerks to Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart, and Vienna. (Reuters, 11th)

### Spanish Nationalist Forces Resume Offensive: Only Sixteen Miles from the Coast

(London) According to the Spanish Information Bureau, the Nationalist forces have resumed their offensive on all fronts in Catalonia. The situation in the north and center is currently unknown. However, in the south, it is claimed that they have captured two high grounds sixteen miles from the Mediterranean Sea. According to a Reuters correspondent, the French border at Hendaye has been closed for at least four days, apparently because reserve forces are carrying out important operations, moving from the north to the area where the government forces are currently launching an offensive on the Estremadura front. (Reuters, 11th)

Zaragoza Yesterday, after occupying TÃ©rmens, the Nationalist forces achieved a significant success in the attack on Catalonia. The troops commanded by General MoscardÃ³ continued to advance along the Lleida-TÃ©rmens road this morning, and have now occupied two villages. At the same time, the troops under General Valeriano, operating in the north, are also advancing along the Cervera-TÃ©rmens road. As a result, the important bases of the government forces' defense line on the northwest sides are under pressure from the Nationalist forces. The troops attacking in the north, after a slight resistance, occupied the TÃ©rmens airfield and a village, and soon made contact with the troops advancing from the west, encircling the city of TÃ©rmens. TÃ©rmens is of great military importance, as it is a hub for traffic between Lleida and Barcelona, and between Montblanc and Cervera. In the southern part of the Catalonia front, the Navarre troops are attacking and have occupied the Sierra de la Llena, cutting off the northern connection of TÃ©rmens. The government forces now have only one lifeline left, which is the one leading to Tarragona. Nationalist artillery fire has been continuously directed at the city since yesterday morning. (Haitong, 11th)

### British Political Turmoil: Lord Privy Seal Uneasy in His Position

(London) The organization of air defense and the protection of ordinary people were originally the responsibility of the Lord Privy Seal, Sir John Anderson, and this may become a cause of disputes. Members of Parliament have recently stated that a political crisis within the cabinet due to air defense organizational issues is not out of the question. It is rumored that Anderson once submitted his resignation, but Prime Minister Chamberlain persuaded him to wait until the Prime Minister returns from Rome before making a decision. The reason for this is that there is no specialized department for air defense matters. Anderson has been given extensive powers to organize air defense without being subject to the constraints of the five ministries: Home Affairs, Health, Education, Labor, and Finance. Ministers of these departments are not obligated to follow Anderson's orders, making it difficult to implement them quickly. This is the reason for their passive attitude. Furthermore, Anderson assumed an important position upon entering politics. Certain cabinet members who aspire to be Prime Minister view him as a strong competitor and harbor feelings of jealousy. This is another reason for Anderson's unease in his position. (Havas, 10th)

### Hungary Recognizes the Puppet State

Budapest The Hungarian government announced today that it recognizes "Manchukuo". (Reuters, 11th)

Budapest Political figures here recently declared that Foreign Minister CsÃ¡ky is scheduled to visit Germany on the 20th of this month. Before the Foreign Minister's departure, the Hungarian government will make a symbolic gesture by recognizing "Manchukuo" as a prelude to joining the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Havas, 10th)

### Eruption of Krakatoa Volcano Between Java and Sumatra

(Singapore) The famous Krakatoa volcano in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra has erupted again. It has erupted nearly 200 times in recent weeks, with flames reaching up to 1,000 feet. Krakatoa volcano erupts frequently. During the eruption in 1883, Banda, 1,050 miles away, was plunged into darkness at noon. Volcanic ash formed a belt, circling the Earth from Scandinavia to the Cape of Good Hope. The vibrations from the eruption were felt 3,000 miles away in Rodrigues and Australia, and triggered giant tidal waves up to 50 feet high, resulting in the deaths of over 36,000 people. (Reuters, 11th)

### Eden Praises Roosevelt's Policies: Calls His Message a Historical Masterpiece

(London) Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a speech at a banquet of the American Chamber of Commerce, praising President Roosevelt's policies. He said, "President Roosevelt's message to Congress yesterday was clear and straightforward, a true masterpiece that will become a historical document. Its importance goes beyond that. In essence, President Roosevelt has pointed out the correct path for all freedom-loving countries in the world, and it has had a very positive impact on the British people. I believe that you all agree with this. However, agreement between Britain and the United States is not enough. We must both believe in the same principles. President Roosevelt's message, both in its wording, which accurately represents the views of the majority of the American people, and in its sentiments, which align with the feelings of the majority of the British people, is something we all recognize and does not need further explanation." At this point, Eden criticized dictatorship, saying, "The most peculiar and terrifying thing after the European war is the new trend of worshiping national idols in Europe. Certain peoples have been infected by it and regard it as a crusade. This is unacceptable to the public in theory, whether in the United States or in Britain. The people of both countries should resist it based on the concepts of rights, nation, and individual freedom. We are not just talking about avoiding infection; democratic countries in Western Europe must also take action to demonstrate that nations founded on our social values are not only capable of organizing themselves but can also become strong. Today, the power of certain countries is very strong. If we continue to use outdated methods to counter them, it would be blind and foolish. The consequences would be unthinkable. If the needs of the nation are hampered or ignored, everything, including individual freedom, will be lost. I am convinced that the British people are increasingly aware of this fundamental problem and are becoming more determined to solve it." (Havas, 10th)

### China and Estonia Sign Treaty of Friendship

(Chongqing) The Treaty of Friendship between China and Estonia, signed in London, has come into effect yesterday. The treaty was concluded on December 21, 1937, and ratified on May 10 of last year. It stipulates that the two countries mutually guarantee eternal friendship, have the right to exchange envoys and consuls, and agree to mutually protect their citizens in accordance with their respective laws, and to conclude commercial and navigation treaties as soon as possible. (Reuters, 11th)

(Chongqing) The Treaty of Friendship between China and Estonia was signed in London on December 21, 1937, by Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and the Estonian Minister to the United Kingdom. It was ratified by the National Government on July 10 of last year, and Guo was appointed as the Plenipotentiary Representative for the exchange of ratification documents. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Guo yesterday stating that the representatives of both sides had exchanged ratification documents in London on the 10th of this month. In accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the treaty, it officially came into effect from that date. The full text of the treaty is as follows:

### Wang Jingwei's Whereabouts a Mystery: Rumored Still in Hanoi, Annam

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since Wang Jingwei issued his infamous telegram, there have been numerous rumors about his whereabouts. Chen Gongbo arrived in Hong Kong by plane from Hanoi the day before the infamous telegram was issued, and said that Wang had already taken a boat from Hanoi to Hong Kong. However, after the infamous telegram was issued, it was suddenly rumored that Wang had crossed the border into Hong Kong and gone to Shanghai, while others said Wang had not come to Hong Kong at all and was still recuperating in Hanoi. His actual location is elusive. According to sources, Chen Gongbo is currently residing in a building on a road in Kowloon Tong, Kowloon. Few people other than those wearing uniforms have been seen entering and leaving this building in recent days. It is impossible to confirm whether Wang is also living inside. According to another source, Wang is currently residing in a French private hospital and has no intention of going to Shanghai. The Hong Kong authorities cannot be responsible for his personal safety, so Wang's movements are extremely secret. He does not receive anyone except for two or three close confidants. Still another source says that Wang has not come to Hong Kong and is still in a hospital in Hanoi. The infamous telegram was issued through representatives in Hong Kong. However, according to more reliable news, Wang seems to still be in Hanoi. There are probably two main reasons for Wang Jingwei's issuance of the infamous telegram: first, some bureaucrats who have been living comfortably all along, although they have not suffered the displacement and family destruction of the refugees since the start of the war of resistance, they cannot enjoy themselves to the fullest as they could in Nanjing. As a result, they have gradually become tired of the war of resistance, which is aimed at the survival of the nation, and have the intention of seeking peace through national betrayal. However, none of them dare to openly advocate this. After a long period of brewing, Wang finally disregarded everything and issued this telegram, because Wang believed that the telegram, once issued, would be widely echoed. Second, since the start of the war of resistance, the foundation of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has become increasingly solid. Some old bureaucrats in the Kuomintang do not take the interests of the entire country as a prerequisite, but haggle over the gains and losses of personal power. They deeply feel that if the war of resistance continues, the left-leaning forces will gradually increase, which will greatly hinder their personal interests, so they gradually developed the idea of seeking peace, hoping to surrender to the outside world in order to consolidate their rule at home. Unexpectedly, once the infamous telegram was issued, people in all regions rose up in opposition. Some figures who originally agreed with Wang's advocacy of peace did not dare to speak out on this issue. Furthermore, Lin Bosheng and Mei Siping were the agents in Hong Kong who handled the issuance of the infamous telegram. Lin had been with Wang for many years. After Shanghai fell last year, Lin came to Hong Kong to serve as Wang's representative, while also holding an important position in the Central Propaganda Department to carry out activities. Mei was not originally a member of Wang's circle, and only became involved with Wang's faction not long ago. When the infamous telegram was issued, Lin and Mei were jointly responsible for signing the document, but Mei seems to be very upset recently.

### Kunshan Guerrilla Forces Actually Share Profits with Puppet Checkpoints: Bandits and Traitors Coexist in Surprising Harmony; Where Is the Mission of Resistance and National Salvation?

Kunshan Correspondence: After the puppet county government appeared in Kunshan, it immediately set up checkpoints everywhere to exploit the people. There are about thirty checkpoints in the entire county, and the monthly income is very large. In addition to the six gates in the urban area, puppet checkpoints have been set up in all the important locations in various villages and towns to carry out extortion. Among them, the puppet checkpoint at the Longwang Temple in Lujiaqiao is the key transportation hub connecting Shanghai, Changshu, Suzhou, Kunshan, and Taicang. Merchants from the interior who go to Shanghai to purchase goods cannot escape this checkpoint, so its income is the highest among all the checkpoints. Puppet officials generally regarded the Longwang Temple checkpoint as a lucrative position. Last month, Chen Wenlong, through the introduction of a certain person, became the puppet tax director of the Longwang Temple. However, there is a very active guerrilla force stationed in the area. At first, the guerrilla force repeatedly ordered the puppet government to stop setting up checkpoints, but the puppet county government refused to give up this area, which was the most profitable area for raising money. After multiple attempts, they negotiated with the guerrilla force, and as a result, the puppet checkpoint handed over half of the monthly revenue to the guerrilla force, to share the spoils. As a result, they lived in peace with each other. Unexpectedly, Chen Wenlong was blinded by greed and did not distribute a portion of the money that should have been given to the guerrilla force last month, but pocketed it for himself. The guerrilla force immediately demanded an explanation from the puppet county magistrate and declared that they would send troops into Kunshan within the shortest possible time. After receiving the report, the puppet magistrate ordered Pan Chen, the head of the puppet police station, to send police to arrest Chen, but Chen had already received the news and fled to another place, escaping arrest. Later, through the efforts of a certain person, he was willing to hand over the original money, and the puppet magistrate approved his request, promising not to pursue the matter in the past, and the matter was settled.

### Guangdong Province Completes Southern Defense: Guangdong-Guangxi Armies Are Assigned to High, Lei, Qin, and Lian Respectively; Cai Tingkai's Troops Are Prepared to Assist in Liangyang

Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in the east and west of Guangdong Province is currently in a stalemate. In the eastern district, from the suburbs of Guangzhou to Zengcheng and Conghua, the mountains are stacked upon each other, and the important roads are all held by the Chinese army. The Japanese army also knows that it is difficult to advance and cannot penetrate deeply. In the western district, the Chinese army has stationed large numbers of troops above Zhaoqing, and Japanese warships cannot easily cross the Zhaoqing Gorge. Therefore, the Japanese army at the Sanshui River Estuary is only increasing its fortifications, and although it has six or seven thousand men, it is not easy to drive westward for a long distance. Moreover, there are tens of thousands of Cai Tingkai's troops on the south bank, and if the Japanese army goes deep, its rear will be in danger of being encircled. The Japanese army also knows that a rash advance will be dangerous, so it first occupied Jiujiang, which belongs to Nanhai, to prevent the southwest Chinese army from flanking it. This is the reason why there is no fierce fighting in the West River recently. Since the Japanese army abandoned the Eastern and Western Rivers, the Chinese army took the opportunity to focus on the coastal areas of the southern region. As the southern region is the vanguard of Guangxi Province, the elite of the Guangxi army has recently arrived to deploy defenses. In general, the Guangxi army focuses on the Qinlian area, the Guangdong army is responsible for the Gaolei area, and Cai Tingkai's troops are deployed in Liangyang to assist the southwest. The Japanese army's attempts to invade the south are based on Weizhou Island, south of Qinlian. The Japanese army on the island has recently built an airfield with a squadron of the Sixth Air Corps. There are six or seven Japanese warships near the island, half of which are responsible for blockading the Hepu coastline, and the rest are cruising off the coast of Qiongya. It was rumored that several Japanese transport ships were transporting troops south, and the southern defense was tense at the same time. Important military officers from Guangxi Province personally went to various places in the southern region to inspect and deploy fortifications. Sixty to seventy thousand troops have been deployed in the area between Qinxian and Hepu, and are also taking care of the Lingshan line to prevent the Japanese army from landing in Hepu and trying to invade Nanning, Guangxi. In addition, large numbers of troops are also deployed in Yongchun, Hengxian, and Nanning on the border of Guangxi. The former line, such as Shawei and Dangwu near Hepu, all have naturally dangerous terrain, and the Japanese attempt to land is not easy. In the Gaolei area, a certain unit of the Guangdong army and the Qiongya defense army support each other, and their strength is also strong.

### Japanese Soldiers in Qingpu Tire of War and Commit Suicide: Five Found in Zhujiajiao

Qingpu Correspondence: Because the Japanese army stationed in various places in Qingpu felt the activity of the guerrillas, they did not dare to take a step outside their strongholds. Now they have received orders to go to the front line, so they have revealed a great sense of war-weariness. Three Japanese soldiers were found to have committed suicide a few days ago. It is now learned that five more Japanese soldiers have been found to have committed suicide in Zhujiajiao in three consecutive days. However, the Japanese side has secretly concealed the suicide of Japanese soldiers, so the actual number may be more than this. This shows the war-weariness of the Japanese soldiers.

### Ningbo Defense Headquarters Supplements Regulations on Passenger Exit; Ningxian Shipping Association Eagerly Awaits Resumption of Business

Ningbo Correspondence: The Ningbo Defense Headquarters previously formulated supplementary measures regarding passenger exits under the Temporary Regulations on Navigation in Eastern Zhejiang and submitted them to the Headquarters of the Eighth Army Group for review. The instructions are as follows: (1) Women and men under the age of sixteen or over the age of forty-five who are going to Shanghai or Hong Kong shall comply with the provisions of the latter part of Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Navigation Regulations. According to the latter part of Article 5, Paragraph 1, those who do not fall within this limit must hold legal documents, identity or a certificate from the local county government or above before they can be released. Civil servants holding legal documents who are going to Shanghai or Hong Kong can be released. (2) When non-residents and civil servants in the area exit, they shall comply with the provisions of Articles 1, 2, and 3 of Article 5, and their certificates shall be issued by their original county government or higher or by the sending agency. (3) Passengers traveling to and from various places in the area, such as Dinghai, Xiangshan, Shipu, and Ninghai, do not need to issue travel permits, and there are no restrictions on goods. However, such passengers and goods can only take small ferry steamships traveling within the area. (4) Passengers and goods traveling to and from the neighboring areas of Wenzhou and Taizhou, shall be examined and processed in accordance with Articles 1, 2, and 3 of Article 5 and Articles 6 and 7 of the Navigation Regulations.

The Ningxian Shipping Association, because the registration of steamships ordered by the Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group will not be allowed to sail until it is approved, has been handled by the Ningbo Defense Department since it took over the port, and they have been registered in accordance with the regulations. The deadline has passed, and it has been more than twenty days. Although seven ships, including Moufu, Kaibo, Xinxiangtai, Tangsai, Meida, Tianbao, and Libao, have been approved for registration, there are still many that have not been announced. Currently, agricultural products are accumulating along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the time is right for the end of the old lunar year, and there is an urgent need to convert to finance. There is a lot of goods waiting to be transported, and the supply and demand situation is difficult to adjust. All the ships waiting to be launched are also eager to resume business as soon as possible in order to make a living. Therefore, they specifically telegraphed Commander Liu, asking him to announce the approved ships at the same time as soon as possible, so that agricultural products can be transferred in time, and shipping companies have equal opportunities.

### The New Fourth Army Focuses on Work Among the People; Farmers Express Their Love and Respect for the New Fourth Army

Continuation of a Dispatch from Belden, Special Correspondent for the English-Language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, from the Headquarters of the New Fourth Army South of Wuhu. The previous article discussed the New Fourth Army's methods of working among the people. This information was obtained from both the army and the people. On the surface, it seemed like propaganda, so I decided to personally investigate the relationship between the army and the people. One day, I spoke with Tang Shihui (transliteration), Deputy Minister of the Political Department, and summoned a farmer to ask, "What do you think of the New Fourth Army?" He replied, "They are excellent because they always pay for what they buy, don't steal chickens, don't force us to work, and don't yell at us or curse us." But this was still not the best evidence. The old farmer might have been saying this because he saw the military officer and me together. That evening, I went to a small store to buy cigarettes. The young shopkeeper invited me to sit down for a cup of tea and we talked about the war. The young man said, "We are not afraid. If the Japanese come, we will fight them because we are organized, have guns, and know how to shoot." When I mentioned the New Fourth Army, he said, "They pay for what they buy, are neat and clean, and talk and play with us, so the people all love them. And the other troops also respect and are friendly to the people." One morning, I was walking in the fields and encountered five children, about ten years old, each holding wooden toy guns, running and pretending to shoot enemies. I asked them what they were doing. One of them said, "We are practicing killing Japanese." I said, "Why don't you shoot me?" They laughed and said, "You are Russian." (Last year, a Russian interviewer came here, so they thought anyone who looked similar was Russian.) Then I told them that I was American. They immediately shouted, "Oh, you must love peace and hate fascism!" On the streets of a town near the headquarters, I often saw civilians and soldiers walking arm in arm, talking and laughing. I also saw children climbing on the soldiers' laps and jumping around. Many soldiers were popular with the people. When walking on the street, I often heard them greeting each other, "Comrade, have you had breakfast? Please come and have some tea," and so on. But this was still not enough proof. One day, I was walking in the fields with [Agnes] Smedley when a farmer came out of his house and invited us in for tea. The neighbors all gathered. According to them, the land here was owned by two large landlords and several small landlords. Each mu (unit of land) was taxed sixty jin (unit of weight) of rice or wheat per year. The farmers in the area were extremely poor. Then a young farmer said, "Before, when the Sichuan army arrived here, they forcibly conscripted laborers to carry things. Later, when the New Fourth Army came here, they told us that the army could not fight without the people. They asked us to help them, and since they were so different from the previous army, we were all willing to help them and organized a farmers' union to cast broadswords and spears and repair old guns. Because we were short of food, we decided to hold a meeting." At this point, the young man took a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me. It read, "Notice to Farmers from the Anti-Japanese United Association of the Twenty-First Bao (administrative unit). We have decided to hold a meeting on the second day of this month (December). We hope all farmers will participate," and so on. The young man continued, "Before the meeting, we asked the landlords to reduce rent, so the landlords did not participate. But we still held the meeting as scheduled and sent a notice to the landlords, stating that 'People have organized anti-Japanese United Association branches everywhere. This year, there is a poor harvest and the front lines are fiercely engaged in fighting. If you do not welcome the arrival of the Japanese army, then extend our debts by one year, so that the farmers can live this year and take up arms to defend their homeland.' But the landlords did not agree to our request. The chairman of the United Association then told the landlords that the rent should be reduced by 20 percent. The landlords had no choice but to agree to reduce the rent. Now we only pay 40 to 45 jin of rent." Now the farmers only have one fear: that the rent will be raised again after the New Fourth Army has to leave. Many farmers have joined the New Fourth Army to fight on the front lines. The New Fourth Army is an army of the people. The people all say, "We help the army, and the army protects us and works with us. This is the right way." I believe this.

### Traitors in Yangzhou Harm Young People by Establishing a Puppet Police and Security School

A dispatch from Yangzhou states that the Japanese army previously planned to forcibly conscript young men from Yangzhou to send to the front lines to fight, but when the young men in the city heard this news, they fled in droves. Later, the traitors Wu Xiaohou and others offered a suggestion to change the conscription to recruitment and established a fake "Police and Security School," falsely claiming that it was training puppet police officers to "pacify" and protect the local area. They claimed that after six months of training and passing the exam, they would be appointed as military officers and would not be subject to the Japanese side's orders or transfers. For a time, more than 600 unemployed young men from various towns in Yangzhou, driven by livelihood and confused, went to register. Wu Xiaohou has now taken the position of puppet principal and has begun active training. Once the training is complete, they will be sent to various battlefields by the Japanese side to serve as cannon fodder and implement their poisonous policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." The traitors are unscrupulous and harming young people, which is extremely painful.

Shanghai Special Edition

### The Financial Market of Shanghai (Continued from yesterday)

â€” Zhang Yifan

Although public debt trading has been transformed into black market dealings, the so-called "Public Concessions" operated by foreign merchants have always been openly sucking up domestic capital. Since the start of the war, the amount of domestic capital flowing out of the country through this channel has been enormous. The following table shows this:

Number of Shares Traded in Public Concessions Securities from January to December 16 of the Past Year

Type Number of Shares Traded in 1937 Number of Shares Traded in 1938

(Note) Source: North China Daily News Dec. 17, 1938.

All kinds of stocks and bonds listed in that place were issued by foreign merchants. The number of transactions of various securities this year has almost increased sharply compared with the past. The amount of absorbed domestic capital must be very large. Recalling the countries during the European war, they only obtained capital from overseas and recovered domestic securities investments abroad, but our country is the opposite. It is lamentable!

Shanghai fell in the winter of last year, so each bank only handled closing of accounts but did not handle liquidation. This year, most banks have successively made supplementary liquidation and announced the balance sheet of assets and liabilities. Now, the important items of assets and liabilities of 23 member banks, including Bank of China, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Bank of Communications, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, China Land Reclamation Bank, Overseas Chinese Commercial Bank, Sichuan Meifeng Bank, Juxingsheng Bank, East Asia Bank, Chung Foo Union Bank, Kuo Hua Commercial & Savings Bank, Pudong Bank, China National Industries Bank, Zhi Zhong Bank, Tong Ho Bank (ceased operation this year), Yung Ta Commercial Bank, Wing Hang Bank, Chung Ho Bank, Chuankang Bank, China Enterprise Bank, and Zhongnan Bank, are separately counted, and the ratio tables are compared with the previous year as follows (unit: national currency thousand yuan)

Statistical Table of Important Business Items of 23 Member Banks in Shanghai

Republic of China Year 26 Republic of China Year 25 Paid-in Capital 116,430 109,128 Public Reserve 28,880 33,482 Cash 481,620 131,176 Banknotes 222,281 ...... Various Loans 1,167,979 1,496,602 Valuable Securities 234,557 168,388

(Note) This table is compiled and counted by the author according to the balance sheets of assets and loans of each bank. If there is any error, I hope the readers will correct it.

There is one shocking figure in the above table, that is, the decrease of public reserve, which cannot be understood. As for the contraction of loans, the slight decrease of deposits, and the increase of cash and valuable securities, they fully reveal the wartime situation. The net profit has indeed decreased sharply compared with the past, but except for the China Bank, which had a net loss in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the rest all had a slight surplus. And the most remarkable are Overseas Chinese Commercial Bank, East Asia Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Sichuan Meifeng Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Kuo Hua Commercial & Savings Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank and other banks, which are all above 200,000 yuan. The rest range from more than 100,000 to more than 2,000 yuan. It was once heard that a certain bank, after August 13, never implemented the measures to stabilize the financial situation and restricted depositors from withdrawing money, so it absorbed a lot of money; later, its entry and exit in the foreign exchange black market was also the most powerful. And now it is also in the midst of obtaining huge net profits; it is really hateful!

If the Bank of China, which had a net loss, is not counted, there were a total of 22 companies with net profits in the 26th year of the Republic of China. The paid-in capital was 76,430,000 yuan in total, and the net profit rate was 4.44%. It can be said that it is really good under the circumstances of war and flying bullets. However, looking back at the report of the British HSBC Bank, the net profit last year reached 12,127,542 Hong Kong dollars, and its paid-in capital was only 20,000,000 Hong Kong dollars. Compared with each other, how can it not be shocking? In recent years, why the governments of various countries have been advocating the merger of banks, is this only for the complete sake of the banks themselves?

As for how the business situation of each bank is this year? There is very little material available at present, so let's take a look at the balance sheet of assets and loans of a large bank:

Comparative Statistics of Business Operations of a Large Bank in Recent Years (Unit: National Currency Thousand Yuan)

### Fierce Encounter in the Southern Section of Yangjing, Pudong; Intense Machine Gun and Steel Cannon Fire; About 20 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded

At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, a fierce encounter between Chinese and Japanese troops occurred again in the southern section of Yangjing, Pudong, near the Nanyangjing Bridge. On the Japanese side, it was a part of the 5th Battalion of the Fuzhai Naval Landing Force. While patrolling the area at night, they were suddenly preemptively ambushed by guerrillas. The two sides first used rifles to bombard each other, followed by intense machine gun fire. Villagers were awakened from their dreams and lay on the ground to avoid stray bullets. According to reports, ten Japanese soldiers were shot dead, and an equal number were wounded. For a time, they could not break through. Later, the battalion headquarters heard the alarm and sent some reinforcements, and dragged out small steel cannons to fire three times in a row to help. To avoid frontal casualties, the Chinese army began to retreat. After suffering losses, the Japanese army waited until dawn to search in various places, but the guerrillas had gone far away, so they returned in a disheveled state.

### Strictly Enforcing Opium Prohibition; Gradual Abstinence in Stages; No Licenses Issued to Those Under 45 From This Year On

In order to strictly enforce opium prohibition, our government has promulgated implementation measures for licensed opium smokers to gradually abstain from opium in stages. Each province and city is preparing to establish a compulsory labor factory to accommodate opium smokers. Opium smokers under the age of 45 will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from January 1 of this year. The details are recorded as follows:

Implementation Measures

Implementation Measures for Licensed Opium Smokers in Each Province and City to Gradually Abstain From Opium in Stages: (1) Those under the age of 45 must abstain from opium before the end of December of the 27th year of the Republic of China and will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from January 1 of the 28th year of the Republic of China; (2) Those under the age of 50 must abstain from opium before the end of June of the 28th year of the Republic of China and will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from July 1 of the 28th year of the Republic of China; (3) Those under the age of 55 must abstain from opium before the end of December of the 28th year of the Republic of China and will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from January 1 of the 29th year of the Republic of China; (4) Those under the age of 60 must abstain from opium before the end of June of the 29th year of the Republic of China and will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from July 1 of the 29th year of the Republic of China; (5) Those over the age of 60 must abstain from opium before the end of December of the 29th year of the Republic of China and the opium abstinence licenses they hold will be revoked at the same time.

Establish Factories to Accommodate

Regarding those over the age of 60 who cannot abstain from opium by the deadline due to special circumstances, they shall be handled in accordance with Article 4 of the Supplementary Rules for Limited-Time Opium Abstinence promulgated by the former Joint Opium Prohibition Supervisor on July 15 of the 26th year of the Republic of China under Order No. 7096 of the Prohibition Administration. After receiving the orders, the governments of each province and city have all been following the above measures and reporting the number of people abstaining from opium in each stage to the Ministry for record. At the same time, they have received orders from the Ministry of Interior to prepare compulsory labor factories in each province, city, and county to accommodate the work of opium smokers. As for the measures for preparing compulsory labor factories and accommodating opium smokers, and the general rules for the management of opium prohibition matters in each province and city, they have all been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Interior and passed at the 397th meeting.

### American Relief Goods Landed and Delivered to the Red Cross; the Original Ship Left Shanghai This Morning

The Continental Daily reported that the 9,000-ton American cargo ship Ruth Buckler, which carried 1,600 bags of American wheat, each weighing 140 pounds, landed this morning (the 11th). In addition to wheat, the ship also carried 75 cases of milk, 100 cases of seasonings, 25 packages of broad beans, 75 cases of canned meat, 25 cases of infant milk, 32 packages of surgical bandages, 50 cases of milk powder, and several bags of "special goods," which were delivered to the Shanghai International Red Cross Committee. The Ruth Buckler is scheduled to set sail for Manila tomorrow morning (i.e., today) with sugar shipped to the United States.

### Jinmen Expo Radio Station to Broadcast to the Far East; Live Broadcasts to Begin at the End of Next Month; Shortwave Receivers Can Tune In

The Continental Daily reported that, according to Ms. Smith, a commercial officer at the American Consulate in Shanghai, the 20-kilowatt shortwave radio station at the San Francisco World's Fair will begin broadcasting directly to the Far East at the end of next month. Engineers from the General Electric Company are working on adjusting frequencies and other matters. Those in this city who have new-style shortwave radios will be able to listen to American broadcasts at that time. At the end of this year, the radio station will be moved and permanently established in Belmont, California, USA. The US Federal Radio Commission has designated the call sign for the radio station as W6XBE, with a frequency of 9530.

### Forty Japanese Soldiers at the Dangkou Salt Factory Completely Annihilated by Chinese Troops; After Completing Their Mission, They Gracefully Withdraw

According to someone from Wuxi, Dangkou Town in Wuxi has become the center of inland river commerce since the war, and the market is extremely prosperous. Merchants and travelers come and go every day. The Japanese side believed that it was very close to the county seat and, for military liaison purposes, dispatched 40 Japanese soldiers to be stationed in the salt factory in the town. Due to economic difficulties, the expenses of this group of Japanese soldiers were provided by the puppet organization in the town from tax revenues and donations from shops. The puppets were extremely obsequious, hiring more than ten Hakka prostitutes to be sent to the factory every night to accompany the Japanese soldiers. However, at 6:30 AM on the 9th of this month, Xiong Jiandong, the commander of the guerrillas in Changshu, Jiading, Taicang, Kunshan, Songjiang, and Shanghai, personally led more than 400 soldiers to surround the town and dispatched more than 80 daredevils to directly attack the salt factory, guarding the front and back doors. Because the walls of the factory were high, they used ladders to climb up and fired simultaneously from a high position with hand grenades and machine guns. At dawn, the Japanese army responded in a panic and could not resist. All 42 Japanese soldiers were completely annihilated by Xiong's troops, and a large number of weapons and ammunition were seized. Later, when the Japanese troops from Wuxi, Changshu, and Suzhou heard the news, they went to rescue along different routes, but the Chinese army, with its mission accomplished, had already gracefully withdrawn.

### People Rush to Sponsor Refugees; Encourage the Public to Cherish Paper; Refugees Collect and Sell Waste Paper

The Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association approved a suggestion from Mr. Jin Zhixuan, stating that a letter was sent previously regarding fundraising through picture donations, which should have been received. Now, another method is considered, which is to cherish paper and collect waste materials to generate profit. It is found that the amount of paper wasted in Shanghai every day is considerable. This paper can be sold for three to four yuan per dan (unit of weight). If the Association makes a public appeal and broadcasts a five-minute report on each radio station every day, and each neighborhood and large building sets up a centralized large basket, which will be collected, sorted, and packaged by the refugees, then each dan of waste paper can support two refugees for a month. This is a cost-free benefit, using old morals to encourage the public, and all sectors should be happy to help. After receiving the information, the Association has forwarded the letter to the Association for review.

Sino-French People Sponsor Refugees

Xu Xiaochu, General Manager of the Sino-French Pharmacy, sent a letter to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, when this Association held the fundraising campaign for all sectors to sponsor refugees, during the first day of broadcasting on the Continental Radio Station of our company, our colleagues jointly sponsored 100 people. The sponsorship fee of 200 yuan for the first month has been paid in advance. Now, a list of donor names is enclosed, and the previously issued general receipt is also returned for your inspection. Please prepare separate receipts according to the list for transfer. In addition to the 100 people raised above, we have now raised funds for another four households, including Jiang Yang Shurong, to sponsor 10 people. Four sponsorship certificates are enclosed, and a donation of 20 yuan is also enclosed. All sponsorship fees for the above 110 people will still be collected and remitted by our company on a monthly basis. Please be informed of the above.

Jiang Yiping Raises More Than 10,000 Yuan

In addition to personally sponsoring 50 people per month, Mr. Jiang Yiping also persuaded people from all sectors to participate in sponsorship. The total amount of the subscription money reached 10,764 yuan, including He Dekui (20 people), Yu Danhan (50 people), Xu Guisheng (25 people), Ms. Wang Guoxiang (25 people), Xue Dubi (10 people), Yu Qiuni Xian (10 people), Wu Lushe (10 people), Tao's brothers (10 people), Tang Shizhen (10 people) Xiang Liansun (25 people), Li Yunfu (10 people), Zai Shaohe (10 people), Yu Junfu (10 people), Zheng Sun Wenshu (10 people), Wing On Company (50 people), Tung Chang Garage (30 people), Peiping Hongrentang (10 people), Hua Mei Shipping Company (20 people), Lun Sheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory (10 people), New China Coal Briquette Factory (10 people), China Match Company (8 people), and many other subscribing households with less than 10 people. Most of them are for a period of one year.

Fukang Company Takes a Percentage for Refugee Relief

Mr. Yao Quanrong, the owner of the Fukang Biscuit Company in this city, has created a kind of five-spice pepper salt biscuit, which is sold on the market and is quite popular among the public. Recently, Mr. Yao, in view of the fact that 100,000 refugees in Shanghai are crying out for food, has decided to donate all of the business profit of 3 cents (national currency) per catty (unit of weight) of his products to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association for refugee relief. At present, the Association has sent staff to verify that the company is indeed not operating for profit and that each catty purchased by all sectors can provide a meal for a refugee. It is heard that all major companies in this city are selling it.

Move Birthday Feast Fees to Sponsor Refugees

Zhang Ruizhi and Qinghua, brothers in this city, sent a letter to the Citizens' Fundraising Committee yesterday, stating briefly, "The other day was our mother's 60th birthday, and we originally planned to hold a feast to celebrate for her. However, our mother is kind and frugal and does not want to spend money on birthdays. She is always concerned about the suffering of refugees. Therefore, following our mother's order, in addition to refusing gifts from relatives and friends, we will donate all of the 300 yuan (national currency) prepared for the birthday feast to help the refugees." The money was entrusted to Zhang Renxin yesterday and transferred to the Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group to sponsor 25 refugees for a period of six months.

### Uniform Government Bonds; Decision to Pay Principal and Interest in Cash; Total Principal and Interest of More Than 50 Million Yuan; All Paid in Cash to Maintain Credit

For the sixth redemption and interest payment of the unified government bonds (Types A, B, C, D, and E) of the Republic of China in the 25th year, the Central Bank and the China Communications Bank, jointly commissioned by it, and the Central Trust Bureau were approved to pay them on the 31st of this month, and the Ministry of Finance specially approved that all of them should be converted into legal tender. Type A: 2.1 million yuan for redemption and 4,315,500 yuan for interest; Type B: 750,000 yuan for redemption and 4,387,500 yuan for interest; Type C: 1.75 million yuan for redemption and 10,237,500 yuan for interest; Type D: 2.75 million yuan for redemption and 16,087,500 yuan for interest; Type E: 1.3 million yuan for redemption and 7,600,500 yuan for interest. The total principal and interest are 51,283,000 yuan.

### Passports to Europe; Still Need to Be Applied for From the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; US Customs Can Handle on Behalf

Since the fall of Shanghai, regarding the application and issuance of passports to go abroad, since the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai has been abolished, all passports to Europe are forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing for approval and issuance through Hong Kong. As for passports to the United States, the Jianghai Customs and the US Consul General in Shanghai have agreed on a method, and it is possible to pay the visa fee directly to the Jianghai Customs, fill out the form, and have the Customs approve it and forward it to the US Consul General in Shanghai for verification and issuance. Since its implementation, people from all walks of life going to the United States have said that it is convenient. As for passports to Europe, they still need to be applied for from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition, if you are going to Yunnan via Annam, the French Consulate in Shanghai can now also issue passports.

### Prices of Japanese Goods Soar; Japanese Nationals Refuse to Buy; Japanese Money Flows to the South of the Suzhou Creek; Buying Japanese Goods Means Losing Out

The North China Daily News reported that yesterday (the 10th), according to the Japanese-language Continental Daily News, Japanese nationals in Hongkou ignored the "Buy Japanese Goods" campaign held by the authorities previously. This can be evidenced by the large number of Japanese customers in major department stores on Nanjing Road in the last ten days of last year. Japanese money is constantly flowing south of the Suzhou Creek. According to what these people listed, the reason for not following the official appeal is that the shops and markets in Hongkou, even cigarette shops and small shops, have raised prices and illegally profited, and the prices are also uneven. The newspaper also quoted a Japanese customer as saying that the personal economic situation made it impossible for him not to buy items in the two concessions, because buying Japanese goods meant losing out. Taking the price of cigarettes as an example, ordinary cigarettes are sold for 75 cents in Japanese clubs, but only 7 jiao (unit of currency, equivalent to 1/10 of a yuan) 8 fen (unit of currency, equivalent to 1/100 of a yuan) across the Suzhou Creek, while in Hongkou shops, the price ranges from 90 sen (unit of Japanese currency, equivalent to 1/100 of a yen) to 1 yuan. And all items have a phenomenon of rising prices. According to a shop owner's explanation, the reason why prices in Hongkou are high and uneven is that Japan has price regulations, and Japanese goods are of "superior quality," and because shops in Hongkou only accept Japanese currency, Japanese nationals spend their money across the Suzhou Creek from Hongkou. The newspaper concluded by saying that the only solution to the conflict of interest between Japanese customers and merchants is to set a formal price standard.

### Du Yuesheng and Others Establish Industries: Paper Mill Set Up in Kunming, Capital of 1.4 Million, Factory Name "Dianfeng," Expected Daily Paper Output of Five Tons After Formal Commencement

Industrialist Du Yuesheng, financier Qian Xinzhi, and the two Wangs from this city, since leaving Shanghai for the south, have devoted themselves to developing industries in the southwest, and have been quite active. In order to recoup losses, they have specifically joined forces with the Minfeng Paper Company of this city to establish the Dianfeng Paper Mill in Kunming, with a fixed capital of 1.4 million yuan. Construction is nearing completion, and formal commencement of operations is expected soon, with a projected daily output of five tons of newsprint to meet various needs. A reporter from Modern News Agency has obtained the following information from the Minfeng Company of this city:

Setting Up a Paper Mill: Recouping Losses

Mr. Du Yuesheng was originally a director of the Minfeng Paper Mill in this city and also chairman of the Huafeng Company in Hangzhou. Since the National Army's westward retreat, and Mr. Du's departure from Shanghai for the south, he has been in Hong Kong with Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, and others, pursuing plans to develop industries in the southwest. Mr. Du also noted that the Huafeng Mill and others had fallen into war zones and could not operate. In order to recoup losses, he planned to establish the Dianfeng Paper Mill in Kunming, with a planned capital of 1.4 million yuan, half to be borne by Shanghai and half by Hong Kong. The Shanghai Minfeng Paper Company also dispatched specialists Zhu Peinong and Chu Fengzhang to Hong Kong last year to discuss progress with Mr. Du and others. They also traveled to Yunnan last November to survey factory sites, consulting with Zhang Xilin, Director of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Construction, who promised to provide full assistance. The equipment for the factory has already been purchased from Germany and will soon be shipped to Yunnan. Once installation is complete, formal commencement of operations should be possible.

Paper Raw Materials: No Worry of Shortage

According to a telegram from Zhu Peinong, specialist from Minfeng Paper Company, Yunnan province has abundant forests and thus abundant paper raw materials. The factory has already decided to use white poplar and pine trees from counties near Kunming as raw materials. Initially, it will purchase from Yiliang, Chenggong, and other places. Later, it plans to establish a forest farm near Haikou for self-cultivation, which should reduce costs and make procurement more convenient.

Projected Daily Paper Production of Five Tons

After the factory commences operations, it plans to specialize in the production of newsprint. Based on the output capacity of the equipment purchased from Germany, it is projected to produce five tons of paper per day. Two and a half tons will be supplied to various newspapers and publications in Kunming, and the remaining two and a half tons will be sold in Guiyang and other neighboring counties. Moreover, the government, to encourage domestic production, has agreed to exempt the factory's products from sales tax, so future prices should be lower than imported goods. If sales gradually increase, the output will be increased to seven tons per day.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Proclamation: Match Monopoly, Effective from January, All Merchandise Sealed

Following the implementation of monopoly systems by various provinces and cities to raise funds for the war of resistance, the Zhejiang Provincial Government announced the implementation of a match monopoly. The proclamation is recorded below: The Zhejiang Province Wartime Match Monopoly Regulations, Article 21, states: "Merchants and vendors selling matches within Zhejiang Province who sell whole packages of matches without the monopoly certificate, or matches not approved for sale by the provincial match monopoly authority, will have the matches confiscated and be subject to a fine of one-half to ten times the retail price. Repeat offenders may have their business suspended." Article 27 states: "After the promulgation of these regulations, all matches held by match factories within Zhejiang Province must be sealed. Those holding whole packages of matches must register with the registration authority designated by the provincial monopoly authority within twenty days after the implementation of these regulations, affixing a registration fee of thirty-six yuan per case. Matches affixed with a registration certificate have the same effect as matches affixed with a monopoly certificate." The match monopoly has been implemented on January 1 of this year and has already been announced. All match merchants and vendors are required to comply, and should not misjudge the situation. This proclamation is hereby issued.

### Seaport Quarantine After the Quarantine Station is Abolished: Customs Port Affairs Section Takes Over, Only One Quarantine Launch Remaining

The Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Station automatically closed down after the National Army withdrew from Shanghai the year before last, leading to a temporary suspension of quarantine work in Shanghai port. Subsequently, the Port Affairs Section of the Jianghai Customs took over, and the health of maritime travelers began to be protected. However, although the Jianghai Customs took over the quarantine work, the necessary quarantine equipment was quite inadequate. For example, the Wusong Quarantine Hospital was destroyed, and the quarantine launches were seized and not returned. Therefore, there were many inconveniences in carrying out the work. It is reported that the Shanghai Quarantine Station had more than ten quarantine launches, including "Zhong Jing," "Cai E," "Mulan," and "Yue Fei." Currently, only the "Zhong Jing" remains, and it was salvaged from the Huangpu River by the Customs (because it had been sunk near Lujiazui) and could only be used after repairs.

### Adjust Wartime Transportation: Establish Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee, Trade Commission Controls Export of Major Local Products, Merchants Exporting Goods Must Register with the Committee

After fully adjusting international trade, the Trade Commission has imposed controls on major local products such as tung oil, silk, and tea. A Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee has been established to handle transportation. Merchants exporting goods must entrust the committee to handle the matter. Details are recorded below:

Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee

In order to adjust water and land transportation of goods during the extraordinary period and improve efficiency, the Ministry of Communications, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, has established a Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee to coordinate transportation improvements. It has appointed Song Zi-liang, Lu Zuofu, Qin Fen, Xu Kan, Yu Dawei, Wang Jingsi, Huang Bingheng, Zou Bingwen, and Duanmu Kai as members of the Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee, with Song Zi-liang as chairman and Lu Zuofu as vice-chairman. The general office is located in Chongqing, and branches or offices are established in various provinces to manage water and land transportation matters.

Trade Commission Controls Exports

After the Ministry of Finance allocated 20 million yuan as a fund, the Trade Commission has been making every effort to adjust international trade, promote increased production and export of local products. Local products subject to foreign exchange settlement are exempt from transit and export taxes, and the Central Trust Bureau underwrites wartime marine insurance. Those certified for export by the commission are allowed to keep the insurance premiums on account, and if the goods are sold at a loss, the insurance premiums are waived. It has now been decided to control the transportation and sale of major local products, and to set prices at the production areas and distribution markets, purchasing as much as possible with available funds. Major local products include tung oil, silk, tea, bristles, leather, mineral sand, and medicinal materials.

Procedures for Entrusting the Export of Goods

Merchants exporting goods must apply for registration with the Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee of the Ministry of Communications. However, when entrusting the committee to transport goods, they must submit a "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate," a "Customs Declaration," and other documents. After verification, registration is approved, and the "Goods Consignment Note" is stamped with the seal of the Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee. After the exporter receives a notification from the committee to dispatch the vehicle, he should contact the transportation agency for loading. However, the addressee on the bill of lading or cargo ticket should be the Bank of China or Bank of Communications that issued the Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate.

### Suzhou Japanese Army's Battle Report: 309 Battles on the North and South Banks of the Yangtze River

The China Press reports that, according to the Japanese-language Continental News on the 10th, from August to December of last year, the Japanese army in Suzhou fought 309 battles with the Chinese army. The central areas of engagement on the south bank of the Yangtze River included Taicang, Kunshan, Jiangyin, and Yixing, while on the north bank they included Tongzhou and Rugao.

### Ministry of Finance Checks on the General Situation of Bank Operations: Report Due Before the End of January

The Central Bank and other banks in this city received a telegram yesterday from the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, requesting that they prepare a report summarizing the details of their operations and the overall profit and loss accounts for the past year, in order to investigate the financial situation of Shanghai in 1938. The reports must be submitted for review before the end of January of this year. After receiving the telegram, the banks have been separately rushing to prepare the account books for submission.

### Regulations for Loading Cargo on Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Stipulated: Freight Rates to be Reduced, Zhongyi Steamship Company Takes the Lead, Further Requesting Authorities' Approval for Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Route

Although the principle of allowing direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been approved with detailed regulations, it awaits the study of the Ningbo County Government and Party Headquarters, together with the Chamber of Commerce. Currently, the Ente of the Zhongyi Company, the New Annetta of the American Weili Han Company, the Mufulu of the German Lihe Company, the Cape of the Ningshao Company (agent for a British ship), and the Xinxiangtai of the Huimin Company (agent for a British ship) have all been approved by the General Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. However, before the direct route is confirmed, direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is temporarily prohibited, and ships must detour through Taizhou and Wenzhou before entering Ningbo, primarily for loading cargo. (1) Mufulu specializes in loading silk cocoons. (2) Cape specializes in loading cotton. (3) Xinxiangtai specializes in loading local paper. (4) Ente and Annetta specialize in loading local goods. The four ships Ente, Annetta, Mufulu, and Xinxiangtai are scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Taizhou or Wenzhou for transfer to Ningbo tomorrow. When departing from Shanghai, in addition to carrying passengers to Taizhou and Wenzhou, they will also load goods approved for import into Zhejiang Province. The designated transport ships for the Wenzhou-Taizhou-Ningbo line are the Meda and Tangsai.

Freight Rates Reduced by Half

Regarding the freight rates of each ship, due to the soaring price of coal after the war and the increased costs, as well as the detour, the passenger and freight rates between Shanghai and Ningbo have continued to increase, causing a sudden increase in the burden on merchants and travelers in eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, Zhou Dalie, chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter requesting a reduction. After the news spread to Shanghai, Zhu Meixian, manager of the Ningshao Steamship Company in this city, responded immediately and telegraphed the Joint Conference of the Ningbo County Party, Government, Military, and Police, requesting approval for direct Shanghai-Ningbo shipping to reduce the expenses of each company, and thus the freight rates should be reduced. Now, the Zhongyi Steamship Company, in consideration of the difficulties of merchants and to facilitate cargo transportation, plans to implement a reduction first. When the company's Ente returns to Shanghai today, all passenger and cargo freight rates will be calculated at half price. It is reported that this has been notified to various customs brokers and passengers. It is heard that other companies will follow suit.

Ningbo Situation: Tranquil as Usual

Yesterday, there were rumors that Ningbo had been bombed by Japanese aircraft a few days ago. People from Ningbo living in Shanghai were concerned about their hometown and inquired about each other. According to employees of the Mufulu who arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning, Ningbo has not seen any Japanese aircraft since November 11 of last year, when a few small bombs were dropped. The recent rumors of bombing in Shanghai are clearly false. At present, the market in Ningbo is becoming more prosperous, especially the Jiangbei shore and Dongmen Street, which are even more bustling. The local order is quite peaceful.

### Ma Xiangbo's Centenary Stamp: Fudan Alumni Request Issuance

Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the founder of Fudan University, is currently residing in Guilin, Guangxi, and this year he reaches the auspicious age of one hundred. Alumni of Fudan from all over have sent congratulatory telegrams. The General Association of Fudan Alumni in this city specifically telegraphed the Chongqing Branch, forwarded to the directors of various schools stationed in Chongqing, requesting the National Government to issue a commemorative stamp. The telegram stated, "(Omitted above) Mr. Ma Xiangbo, founder of our alma mater, is a great elder of the world and a contemporary master. This year he reaches the age of one hundred, a cause for celebration not only for those who have studied under him but also for the nation. Moreover, in times of chaos and famine, people's hearts need to be uplifted. Our association hereby proposes requesting the National Government to issue a commemorative stamp to show the utmost respect for the virtuous and the elderly. We ask for your wise decision and proceed accordingly, and hope to hear back from you." It is also heard that the association has appointed alumni Xu Xiaochu, Bao Kangzhi, Wang Sifang, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Ye Bingfu, Jin Tongyin, Mao Xibi, Liu Bainian, Yin Yiwen, and Yang Minren to form a birthday celebration preparation committee in preparation for holding a meeting at a later date to offer remote congratulations.

A congratulatory letter to Mr. Ma Xiangbo stated: "Respected Teacher, Greetings. Guilin is remote, but blessed by heaven. Like those who lived in seclusion in He Fen and taught at Luo Chuan, you possess a spirit of harmony and nurture a virtuous heart. All call you a learned scholar, and all praise your teachings. You are the great elder of our age, and all recommend you as the paragon. This year, we joyfully celebrate your centenary birthday, reaching the age of great completeness. Like Zhang Cang, who was nurtured on breast milk, we sing of eternal blessing in poetry. Unlike Liao, who sought immortality through elixirs, you are far beyond those who carried a cane in their home village. Accomplishing great deeds, words, and virtue, you are nearly perfect. The star of the old man appears, foretelling auspiciousness in the South Pole. The Tao respects the teacher, gazing eastward. We, your students, have been scattered by war, having barely survived this calamity. The vast ocean is where we now call home. We wish to follow in your footsteps, hoping to be among the disciples of Shen Gong, and aspire to enter your chambers and study the teachings of Han. Like cutting water to dye the clouds, or pouring silver and jade, we send our humble respects from afar, but lack the skill to craft eloquent praises. Our joy is deep, and our expression is endless. We specially send our congratulations, and respectfully wish you peace."

Jinle Lane Increases Rent by 40% and Refuses to Accept Remittances; Tenants' Association Sends Letter to Mediation Committee for Mediation

### Jinle Lane Increases Rent by 40% and Refuses to Accept Remittances; Tenants' Association Sends Letter to Mediation Committee for Mediation

All tenants of Jinle Lane, Weihaiwei Road, jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Special Zone Rental Dispute Mediation Committee, stating that the management office of the lane, Tongyuan Bank, has increased the rent by 40% per month from January 1939 and requires that the rent be paid in full by the end of December. In addition, various expenses such as tap water must be paid in legal tender, so the rent in the lane will also be changed to cash payments. After discussions among the tenants, they unanimously refused to recognize this unreasonable rent increase. In addition to forming the Jinle Lane Tenants' Association to refuse the increase and sending a letter to the management office to take note, they specifically stated the reasons and requested the committee to mediate.

### Japanese Postal Workers Plan to Restore Postal Services in Anhui: Japanese Postal Workers Depart to Prepare, Shanghai Postal Office Faces Difficult Circumstances

Postal delivery between Shanghai and Hankou has been restored, and the resumption of postal services in Anqing is also being prepared. However, outside information is unclear about the post office situation, and there are many inaccurate reports. The various situations are listed below:

Shanghai-Hankou Postal Delivery Restored

For mutual delivery of mail between Shanghai and Hankou, the mail sent from Shanghai to Hankou was loaded onto Japanese merchant ships on the 3rd of this month. The first batch of mail sent from Hankou to Shanghai was transported back to Shanghai on Japanese ships on the 10th of this month. Detailed postal information on that aspect will be available after the official letter from Smith, the postal director of Hankou, arrives with the first batch of mail loaded for Shanghai.

Japanese Side Prepares to Restore Anhui Postal Services

The mail currently being sent and received between Shanghai and Hankou is entirely limited to light items. "Light items" includes regular letters, postcards, registered letters, and express letters. Small parcels, bulk packages, and remittances are beyond the scope of light items and cannot be delivered. The Shanghai Postal Administration has dispatched Japanese postal workers Fukuka Yutaka and Okada to the Anqing Postal Administration of the Anhui region to prepare for restoration. It is hoped that this will be realized soon.

Post Office Faces Difficulties

Currently, the Shanghai Postal Administration has three Japanese postal workers working in the office. In addition, there are 21 Japanese mail inspectors stationed in the office, arbitrarily inspecting mail in various departments. As for the restored postal services in the guerrilla areas, due to the pressure of evil forces, their environment is becoming increasingly difficult, which is inevitable. Therefore, the post office feels very difficult.

### Jewish Refugees Suddenly Receive Timely Rain: Sassoon Donates Large Sum, To Be Used as Re-establishment Fund, 200 More People Arrive on Sunday

The Continental News reports that Sir Sassoon, a prominent businessman in this city known as "the richest foreigner in China," has recently remitted a large sum of money from his London residence to the Committee for the Re-establishment Fund for German Jewish Immigrants in this city. The fund aims to assist German Jewish refugees in this city to engage in various businesses. The committee has already helped refugees open clothing stores, etc. Just when the fund was lacking, they suddenly received a telegram from Sir Sassoon announcing a large donation, like a withered seedling

Suddenly Receiving Timely Rain

However, the exact amount cannot be disclosed at this time. According to committee chairman Spielman yesterday (the 10th), "We intend to provide assistance within our means, but there are no fewer than 1,500 immigrants in Shanghai. The scale of this work is evident from this. The Re-establishment Fund is different from the ordinary fund for maintaining immigrants. Currently, the ordinary fund requires 90,000 yuan per month." Jewish immigrants have already

Found Employment

A considerable number of immigrants have found employment. The committee has appealed to the Shanghai International Red Cross to assist in maintaining immigrants more economically, as the Red Cross has rich experience in providing relief to Chinese refugees. Yesterday, Dr. Baker, an executive of the Red Cross, replied to a reporter's inquiry that the committee is now discussing the issue of immigrant meals, which can reduce the monthly cost of meals to five yuan per person. Currently, the cost of meals alone for each immigrant exceeds 30 yuan per month.

Continuing to Arrive in Shanghai

The Continental News reports that the ship Victoria arrived in Shanghai on Sunday (the 15th), carrying 200 Jewish people expelled from Germany. The total number of German Jewish immigrants in Shanghai will thus increase to more than 1,700 people. This confirms that the ban on immigrants coming to Shanghai has not yet been implemented.

### Rampant Coastal Pirates in Eastern Zhejiang, Authorities Vigorously Suppress Them, Promulgate Measures to Reward the Capture of Pirates

The coastal pirates of eastern Zhejiang, instigated by a certain party and calling themselves the "So-and-So Allied Army," are extremely rampant.

### Criminal Section No. 8 of the Public Concession Police is Abolished, Remarkable Achievements in Handling the Yellow Way Society Terrorist Case, Personnel of the Section Now Transferred to Section No. 1 for Office Work

Previously, due to the frequent occurrence of terrorist cases and murders within the Public Concession, the Public Concession Police Authority established Criminal Section No. 8 for the purpose of dedicated investigation, selecting seven Chinese detectives and three Western detectives to specialize in the matter. After the establishment of the section, it arrested important members of the "Yellow Way Society" who had created terrorist incidents and handed them over to the First Special Court for severe punishment, greatly reducing the number of terrorist incidents in the Concession. Now, the authorities believe that public order within the Concession has gradually returned to normal, making it unnecessary to establish a separate special section. Therefore, on the 9th of this month, an order was issued to abolish the section, and all personnel of the section were transferred to Criminal Section No. 1 for office work. After receiving the order, the section immediately announced the cessation of office work on the 9th, and unfinished matters were transferred to Section No. 1 for handling.

### Italian Soldiers Open Fire on Xiaoshadu Road Yesterday Morning, Causing Trouble, Chen Peiqing Shot Twice in the Leg, Police Authorities Investigating

At around 6 a.m. yesterday morning, an incident occurred on Xiaoshadu Road, Hongshui Lane in West Shanghai in which Italian soldiers opened fire and shot a Chinese man. At the time, a Chinese man named Chen Peiqing, originally from Yixing, 44 years old, resided in a lean-to in the lane. Chen got up early in the morning to go to Laohushe to soak in the water and was about to return home. Needing to relieve himself, he urinated in the lane. This was seen by an Italian soldier in the area, who, seeing Chen acting hastily, immediately shouted loudly to stop him. Because Chen did not understand the Italian soldier's language, he hurried to his residence. The Italian soldier became even more suspicious, thinking that Chen was a criminal element, and immediately raised his rifle and fired two shots, hitting Chen in both legs. Chen immediately bled and fell to the ground. The incident was learned by the Putuo Road Police Station in charge of the area, and they immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and transported Chen Peiqing to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. According to news last night, Chen's life is expected to be out of danger after treatment of his injuries. The Public Concession Police Authority is conducting a detailed investigation into the incident.

### Sun Huifen Loses Identity Lawsuit

Li Shiyang, former Director of the Zhengtai Railway Bureau from Hubei, originally had a legal wife, Shou Shi (named Yu), and a concubine, Wu Wenhua. In 1933, he separated from his concubine and ordered his wife, Shou Yu, to live in Peiping with their children. While in Shanghai, Li became involved with Sun Huifen, a woman from Dongting Mountain in Suzhou, the divorced concubine of his sworn brother surnamed Wang.

They Lived Together in an Affair

In the autumn of 1937, Li's wife, Shou Shi, came to Shanghai from Peiping with her children to escape the war. After living with Li, Li died in Guangci Hospital in October of that year. Shou Shi handled the funeral arrangements. Because Sun had taken over funds that Li had given her before his death, Shou Shi discovered that Sun Huifen had committed adultery and lived with her deceased husband during his lifetime. Shou Shi then filed a private criminal prosecution in the Second Special Court against Sun Huifen for disrupting the family. Sun also went to the civil court of the Second Special Court to

Request Confirmation

of Ownership of the deposit. This is currently on appeal. Now, Sun Huifen's father has hired lawyers Ma Shouhua and Cheng Shangfeng to represent her in filing a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against Li Shouyu to confirm her identity. The reason given is that she formally married Li Shiyang in Hangzhou on April 18, 1936, and that Li stated beforehand that he had divorced his wife, Shou Shi, in 1933, and

Submitted Newspaper

clippings, etc. Judge Li Liang opened a court session to summon the defendant, who also hired a lawyer as her representative. The case was then declared closed after deliberation, and a date was set for the verdict. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Li delivered the verdict, rejecting the plaintiff's claim and ordering the plaintiff to bear the costs of the litigation.

### Wan Na Ship's Whereabouts Unknown, Chartered Ship Fraud Lawsuit, First Special Court Continued Hearing Yesterday, Original Defendants' Testimony Inconsistent

Cao Hongyi, manager of the Yitai Shipping Company, previously chartered the Wanna, a ship flying the Italian flag owned by the company, to Luo Wanxiang, owner of the Guangdong Road Gongda Customs Brokerage, through the intermediary of Shi Guangchang. Luo then formed the Hankou Shipping Company and appointed Shi as its manager to operate the shipping business. Later, Luo claimed that Shi and others could not obtain a sailing permit issued by the Japanese from the Tianli Shipping Company and did not deliver the chartered ship as scheduled. Cao, on the other hand, claimed that Luo did not pay the rent. As a result, disputes arose between them. Luo then accused Shi, Cao, Wu Chaohua, Ma Chengben, the Yongbo owner of the Yuantai Heng Paper Store on Fada Road, and Huang Zhichu, a certain ship comprador, of jointly

Obtaining Property by Fraud

and reported them to the Huishi Police Station. Detective Tao Gengrong successively arrested and detained the defendants for questioning at the First Special District Court. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing opened a court session and ordered the five defendants, Shi, Cao, Wu, Ma, and Huang, to be brought to court for further trial. First, the plaintiff, Luo Wanxiang, detailed the sequence of events, stating that he first met Shi Guangchang through an introduction from a Mr. Sun in June of last year. Shi was engaged in the business of ship brokerage. In November, Shi came to him and said that Yitai Company had an

Italian Ship

called Wanna for charter. The ship could sail to the ports, and he could also handle the insurance policy and permit. The monthly rent was 11,700 yuan in legal tender. As he wanted to rent a ship for the aforementioned route, he visited the ship the next day and, at Shi's suggestion, paid a deposit of 2,000 yuan in foreign currency. Later, on the day of signing the charter, he had someone bring 5,000 yuan to Shi's office in the Hamilton Building to pay. However, the conditions stipulated in the contract were not what he originally intended, and he was very dissatisfied. On that day, Shi also asked him to lend 2,000 yuan to Wu Chaohua, saying that Wu was one of Yitai's shareholders and had considerable authority

to Facilitate the Loan

and ensure early delivery of the ship. However, after the loan was given, the ship could still not be delivered on the agreed date. At that time, he had also learned that Yitai was not able to charter the Wanna. On the morning of December 6th, Cao Hongyi, Chen Peijun, the owner of the Lida Customs Brokerage who is now the chairman of the trade association, and a Mr. Zhou came and said that there were internal disagreements within Yitai and that the ship could not be chartered. They asked to stop payment of the 6,700 yuan check for the continuing rent, which was due on the 6th. As he happened to be out of the office, his accountant, Shen Weidong, and associate manager, Yuan Jialun,

Both Witnessed

and heard it. Therefore, he did not cash the check. That evening, Shi suddenly visited with a Japanese person. The Japanese person said to Shi, "If you hand over the ship, I will take you to Hongkou and kill you." Although these words were addressed to Shi, they were in fact intended to intimidate him. He issued another check for 4,700 yuan to Shi. However, as he already knew that the ship could not be chartered, he immediately notified the bank the next morning to stop payment of this 4,700 yuan check as well. As for commissioning Shi as manager, it was because Shi said that after the ship was chartered, it had to make a mandatory transport to Hankou for the Japanese military. He thought this was the work of

A Traitor

and did not want to come forward himself to take responsibility for the establishment of the Hankou Shipping Company, so he gave Shi the title of manager to do it together. Later, Shi knew that many things had not been handled properly and resigned himself. In total, he was defrauded of 7,000 yuan in cash and a 6,700 yuan check. The ship has not been delivered to this day. The defense lawyers for the defendants, Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, Jiang Yiping, and others, then successively attacked the points in Luo Wanxiang's testimony that were not in accordance with the facts, saying that the bank where Luo issued the check had only a few yuan in deposit on the 6th, and that Cao Hongyi and others

Did Not Notify Stop Payment

on the morning of the 6th, and that among the 7,000 yuan that Luo successively paid, there was also a 500 yuan check that Shi had advanced. However, Luo's employees, Shen Weidong and Yuan Jialun, testified in court that Cao and the other three had come to the Dagon Customs Brokerage that morning to actually notify them to stop payment of the check. The court immediately questioned Cao about this. Cao testified that he went to inform Luo to prepare cash that morning, because the check had already been transferred to someone else and had to be cashed, and he never told him to stop payment. Detective Tao then reported that the Wan Na ship had not been received by the plaintiff, according to investigation, and was still being held by a certain party. However, the defendants' lawyers requested that the ship's whereabouts be investigated with Customs. The court then ordered all defendants to be returned to custody and adjourned the hearing.

### Driver Runs Over and Kills Person, Trial Concluded and Awaiting Verdict

Wang Jinfang, a driver of bus number 47 of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, drove bus number 15119 of route 9 to the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession at around 9 a.m. on December 16 of last year. In order to avoid pedestrians, the bus ran onto the sidewalk, hitting and killing pedestrians Zhang Miaorong and Zhang Guoren one after the other. Zhang Guoren's head was crushed, a particularly tragic sight. The French police arrested the driver and filed a public prosecution in the Second Special Court for causing death due to professional negligence. The trial by Judge Sun Pengham has not concluded. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Liao Yuanwei, acting Judge of Criminal Court No. 1, announced a renewed trial. The defendant hired lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong to defend him. First, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer representing the French Concession administrative authorities, presented the case. The part concerning the victim Zhang Miaorong has been settled with compensation from the company. Only Zhang Guoren's wife, Zhang Wu Shi, and her lawyer came to court to request redress and additional compensation of 6,480 yuan. Witnesses Zhang Yaoshan and Wang Rongbiao then testified that the defendant was driving fast. When questioned, the defendant Wang Jinfang testified that at that time, around 9 a.m., there were many cars on the road and he could not drive fast. However, public buses are different from ordinary vehicles. The bus was very crowded with passengers and the bus itself was very heavy and could not drive fast. He really could not avoid the pedestrians, causing him to run onto the sidewalk and cause the accident. He asked for leniency. After examining the testimony, the court held that the facts of the case were clear and ordered the opening of arguments before announcing the conclusion of the trial. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 18th. The defendant was returned to custody.

Selling Stolen Ducks, Arrested and Questioned, Claimed They Were Stolen, Still Pending Investigation and Verification

Shen Tingfang, a Ningbo native, 43 years old, manager of the Hexing Chicken and Duck Company at 659 Sanma Road in this city, sent people to Ningbo at the end of last month and spent more than 3,000 yuan to collect 4,200 fresh ducks. After slaughtering them, they were packed into 24 wooden boxes and 15 barrels and hired the Jinlongxing civilian boat to transport them to Shanghai for sale. At 4 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, when the boat arrived near the port of Nanhui in this province, it was intercepted by pirates who stole all the ducks. After being robbed, the boat came to Shanghai to report to the Hexing Chicken and Duck Company, which sent people to investigate. On the 9th, they found that Tang Lianchu (29 years old), a Nanhui native, was peddling the skinned ducks to the Gongmao Catering Company at 20 Caishi Street in the French Concession. They went to the Gongmao Catering Company to inquire that afternoon and happened to see Tang negotiating a deal to sell 769 skinned ducks to Li Hongsheng, the manager of Gongmao. Shen Tingfang, the manager of Hexing Company, reported this to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Tang Lianchu. He was escorted to the 8th Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday and questioned by Judge Wu Kechou. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that the defendant was suspected of theft and requested a postponement of the investigation. The defendant hired lawyer Mao Xiankun to defend him. When questioned, the defendant Tang Lianchu testified that he was in the wild game business and that vendors from the countryside transported goods to Shanghai for him to sell to various catering companies. He claimed that two boatmen in Nanhui told him that their boat was stranded in shallow water and that they were afraid the goods would spoil and peddled the ducks to him, so he bought them for 825 yuan and transported them to Shanghai to sell. He did not know that they were stolen goods. The plaintiff then requested that the detained ducks be returned to him first. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer stated that the case could not prove that the defendant was suspected of theft, because the plaintiff's goods were robbed on the afternoon of the 2nd, and at that time, the defendant was still in Shanghai. Moreover, the place where the incident occurred was in Nanhui, and the jurisdiction of the court could not be determined according to the agreement. He requested that the defendant be allowed to be released on bail pending trial. After considering the circumstances, the court ordered the hearing to be postponed to the 18th and released him on cash bail pending investigation.

### "Astrologer" Misleads the Public with Falsehoods, Young Woman Thoroughly Bewitched, Defrauded of More Than 6,500 Yuan, Husband Demanded Money and She Finally Revealed the Truth

After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, an astrologer named Lin Musen appeared at No. 18, Lane 641 (i.e., Diecun), Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai, greatly promoting himself, exaggerating to his heart's content, and the Jianhua Broadcasting Station even made broadcasts to promote him, causing countless superstitious people to be lured into his illusory traps and lose their assets. In fact, this charlatan is by no means a Liu Junping of his time. His original name is Hua Dawei, from Wuxi, and he is only around 30 years old. In previous years, he was hired by the police as a translator, but was dismissed after only three days due to incompetence. Later, he had a falling out with his wife and was sued for divorce. Therefore, he repeatedly changed his name afterwards, such as Hua Renzhong, Hua Dongwei, etc., all of which were names he used in the past.

He Called Himself an Astrologer

and used the name Lin Musen to carry out his deceptive skills. A young woman surnamed Xue, who lived at No. 82 Jing'an Temple Road, was attracted by the exaggerated words of the radio broadcast and went to seek a fortune-telling in June of last year. The woman and her husband happened to be not very harmonious, and Hua discovered her secret feelings. He then used this weakness to make inflammatory remarks, exactly catching the woman's itch and making her think he was psychic. Therefore, Hua induced her with his supposedly miraculous skills that could restore her marital love and gave her a small amount of white powder, telling her to secretly put it in the tea

For Her Husband to Drink

Afterward, her love would increase. He charged 20 yuan in legal tender for the powder. The woman returned home and followed the instructions, but the powder floated on top of the tea, so she dared not give it to her husband. Later, Hua ordered her to put it in the porridge instead, but there was no obvious effect after taking it. However, at this time, the woman was deeply bewitched and not only did not realize it, but also obeyed Hua's every word. Hua then enticed her with wealth, taking out a black, hard object from the furnace one day, saying it was

Transmuted Gold

First, he scraped off the dirt on the surface of the object with a knife, and a yellow color appeared. To strengthen the woman's trust, he took her to the Qutianbao Silver Shop, where it was verified that there was indeed some gold in it, worth 19 yuan. Another day, he gave the woman a small box with yellow paper talismans inside, telling her to bring it home and wait until late at night for a sound to come from the box. The God of Wealth would then descend from Guiyang. He has used such tricks countless times over the past six months, and each time he did, he asked the woman for money. The woman first used the legal tender from her home, and when the legal tender was exhausted, she used gold jewelry.

The Woman Was as If Drunk, as If Mad

Every night she only hoped that there would be a sound in the box and ignored her sleep, so she has now become ill due to insomnia. Her foolishness is indescribable. By the end of the lunar year, her husband needed money to use and asked the woman for it. The woman could not respond and only then did she fully reveal the deception she had suffered. He immediately reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives Wu Chengmo and Liang Yuliang, along with Western detective Luo Linyong, to Diecun to investigate and arrest him. However, Hua had already heard the news and fled far away. It was not until the night before last that they learned that he was with

His Paramour Serving as a Guide

Jin Xiuqin, hiding in the Central Hotel. They went to arrest him, confiscated eight pawn tickets and more than 190 yuan in legal tender, and took them back to the police station. After questioning, Hua was detained until yesterday morning, after releasing Jin, and escorted to the First Special District Court. According to police lawyer Qian Xunjiu, the cash and jewelry that the defendant defrauded were worth more than 6,500 yuan. Judge Dai questioned the defendant, who also admitted to the untruthful statements. He was then ordered to be held in custody pending another hearing.

### Streetcar Runs Over and Kills Two People, Judge Verifies Corpses, Company Refuses Compensation

Yao Yuxiang, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei living at No. 53, Yuchang Lane, Caishi Road in the French Concession, had a five-year-old daughter named Xiaozai Zi. At 0:17 p.m. on the 10th, while walking on the side of the road in front of No. 262, Caishi Road, a French-owned Route 18 trolleybus No. 151 driven by Yang Along was speeding from north to south. The girl was unable to avoid it and was knocked down by the rear wheel on the right side of the trolleybus, running over her lower body and legs. The skin and flesh of her right leg were completely

Crushed Open

a tragic sight. The police recorded the number and sent the injured child to Guangci Hospital, but she died without treatment at 1 p.m. The body was carried to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy.

Also, Chen Shougao, a Taizhou native, 42 years old, was walking on the side of the streetcar tracks at the intersection of Huangpu Tan Road and Taiwan Road in the French Concession at 7 p.m. on the 9th. A French-owned Route 10 streetcar was traveling from south to north. Chen

Could Not Avoid

it and was knocked down and injured in the head. He was sent to Guangci Hospital by the police but died without treatment. The body was carried to the mortuary. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court came to the mortuary to verify the bodies of Yao Xiaozai Zi and Chen Shougao. He confirmed that they had died from injuries sustained after being hit by the streetcar. The families of the deceased, Yao Yuxiang and Chen Youzhi,

Petitioned for Redress.

The official questioned the defendants Yang Along (driver of Route 18 trolleybus No. 211) and Qiao Shouguang (driver of Route 10 streetcar No. 272) about the circumstances of the accident, and then ordered that the two bodies be handed over to the families to be claimed after they signed a statement. The defendants were escorted to court by the police in accordance with the law for questioning. It is said that the French streetcar company believes that the two drivers were not at fault and that the deceased were to blame, so they refused to pay any compensation to the families of the deceased. Both families of the deceased are laborers and have no money to collect the bodies of the deceased.

### Concluding the Dispute Over Relocation and Rent

Mr. Wang Yimin, a native of Nanhui, also known as lawyer Wang Youlin, previously rented a house from Mr. Yu Hong at No. 16 Beiler Road in the French Concession. Due to accumulated rent arrears, Mr. Yu Hong repeatedly sued in the Special No. 2 Court to recover the rent and demand the eviction of the premises. After a final judgment was made in favor of Mr. Yu Hong, the court repeatedly ordered enforcement without success. On December 15th of last year, the enforcement division of the Special No. 2 Court, along with bailiff Shen Qing and court police officers, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives from the French police station, and Mr. Yu Hong, accompanied by his attorney Yin Tinghua, went to No. 16 Beiler Road to enforce the eviction. Although Mr. Wang had already left the house, he still had office equipment and a cook inside. After the bailiff carried out the eviction and moved Wang's belongings outside the door, three tenants of the house, Yao Wu Zhiying (the wife of Yao Gucheng, a secretary of the Ministry of Judicial Administration), and Chen Gengsheng (an employee of the 45th Reception Center), among others, engaged lawyers Tang Hao and Zhang Weiqing to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Mr. Yu Hong, his attorney Yin Tinghua, the bailiff Shen Qing, and the court police officers, accusing them of damaging furniture, public insult, injury, defamation, and obstructing freedom, and seeking compensation for losses through a civil suit. The defendants retained lawyers Wang Shizong and Zhang Juansheng, among others, to defend them and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The case was heard twice. The previous report noted that the plaintiff Chen Gengsheng, on behalf of Tao Zhendou, accused lawyer Yin Yanhua of ordering him to sign a pledge to move and affix his fingerprint. The debate on this case has concluded, and at 9:00 AM yesterday, Judge Jiang Liquan presided over the trial in Criminal Court No. 2 and acquitted both parties and rejected the plaintiffâ€™s attached civil suit. It is said that the civil court also confirmed Wang's responsibility for the entire eviction through another case. This brought an end to a pointless dispute over the Wang-Yu relocation issue.

### French Police Send Officers to Investigate Schools in the Concession

The Shanghai French Concession Police Headquarters has learned that there are numerous schools within the concession. To understand the number of male and female students in each school, they have dispatched detectives to various schools to investigate the number of current male students, female students, the total number of students, and the number of teaching staff.

### Autopsies of Two Suicide Victims

Zhang Zhixiang, a 49-year-old native of Ningbo, was a boatman involved in commerce. Since the outbreak of the war, he had been unemployed and idle, suffering economic hardship. He conceived the idea of suicide. On the afternoon of the 9th, at 4:00 PM, he went to the Anshang Inn at No. 33 Balizhao Road in the French Concession, claiming to be staying in room 53. He committed suicide by drinking poison. The waiter Tan Amao noticed that Zhang was still sleeping late into the afternoon the next day and knocked on the door, asking if he needed anything for the room. After a long period of silence, he managed to break open the door and found that Zhang had already died. He reported it to the French police, who transported the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Funeral Home. Gao Jingming, a 26-year-old native of Luodian, also committed suicide due to economic hardship. On the afternoon of the 8th, he went to the Huaxing Inn at No. 322 Mintinenyin Road in the French Concession, renting room 17 and drinking poison. The waiter Tang Sanlin discovered it at 9:00 PM that night and reported it to the police, who sent him to Renji Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and he died at 3:00 AM on the 10th. The hospital notified the French police, who transported the body to the autopsy room. Yesterday, the Special No. 2 Court was notified, and Prosecutor Wang Ren visited the location. The autopsies revealed that both Zhang and Gao died from poisoning. Since the families of the two bodies could not be located, the officials instructed that the bodies be handed over to the charity for burial, pending identification by relatives.

Stray Bullet Wounds a Man

Wang Yizhang, 55 years old, was hit in the right leg by a stray bullet in Qingpu a few days ago. After being injured, he took a boat to Shanghai for treatment.

It is said that his leg bone has been broken and he may be permanently disabled.

At dawn yesterday morning, they apprehended Shen Genfu from Suzhou and Zhang Xiaomao, a woman from Ningbo, at No. 20 Maohouli, Dagu Road, seizing various equipment for manufacturing heroin. They were all taken back to the police station and then escorted to Criminal Court No. 1 of the Special No. 1 Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that in addition to robbery, the defendants were suspected of manufacturing drugs, but the investigation was not yet complete and asked that they be temporarily detained.

### Italian Ship Returns to Shanghai - Narrowly Escapes Robbery by Pirates - Avoids by Increasing Speed - One Passenger Killed in Previous Encounter

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the Italian ship "Libia" was once strafed with machine guns by pirates, resulting in the death of a Chinese passenger. Therefore, the crew was exceptionally cautious. Yesterday (the 10th), the ship returned to Shanghai. About twenty miles upstream of Wusong, they spotted a sailboat. The crew observed it with binoculars and saw that the sailboat was very busy, with machine guns and rifles set up. The "Libia" increased its speed and managed to escape danger. The pirate ship did not have a chance to fire a shot. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The fact that it had no bulletproof equipment and was not robbed was indeed fortunate. According to reports, this was the fourth time in two days that ships had encountered pirates in the Yangtze River. On Sunday afternoon, the "Libia" was attacked, resulting in the death of a Chinese passenger. An hour later, the German ship "Hansa" was also strafed with machine guns and rifles by pirates in the same area, with at least sixty rounds fired, injuring two passengers. On Sunday, the tugboat "Hanhe" and two other tugboats were also fired upon with machine guns by pirate ships, but the ship continued sailing.

### Securities and Public Debt Experience Another Sudden and Significant Decline - If It Is Not Understood Why They Rose in the Past, It Is Impossible to Know Why They Are Falling Today - Moreover, There Is a Rumor That Interest Will Be Paid in Chongqing - However, Foreign Debt Market Conditions Are Also Limited in Supply

Yesterday's securities market experienced a relatively large reversal. This was a reaction to the breakthrough of successive increases and the discovery of new peaks. Since December 12th of last year, it has been driven by various favorable circumstances, resulting in a sudden rise. On December 23rd, Class A broke through the 60-yuan barrier and rushed to 61 yuan, breaking the previous high of 60 yuan and 8 jiao on May 9th of last year, when the Taierzhuang victory was achieved. In the subsequent half-month, a new record of four consecutive high prices was discovered. In total, the increase in two weeks was as much as 12 yuan. The intensity of the surge was considerable. However, this was only because Class A was uniquely endowed, so its rate of progress was also more rapid than other types of securities. A sudden surge caused a reversal, which was also an inevitable obstacle in the process of the surge. The current situation is that only spot transactions are taking place, which is completely different from the previous futures market. The previous surge did not rely on multiple parties pushing up prices, but on short covering. Today's surge, while it also does not rely on multiple parties pushing up prices, solely relied on the non-outflow of spot goods. Yesterday's rebound was largely influenced by the outflow of spot goods on the 15th. The market was under new pressure and felt unsupported, and the Qianye Gang also sold to the market in the same way. The support of retail investors was insufficient, and many fell sharply by more than one yuan. In the afternoon, there were even unfounded rumors that the interest payment would be changed to Chongqing to avoid the outflow of cash. However, some people believed that this was not true. Xie Da Ho reportedly sold a lot in the market, and Tiansheng Ho also came out, but most of the buyers were retail investors, but the market then read 60,70 jiao. These rumors should become clear within a day or two, and the financial community will certainly not admit this statement. Let us record it to be verified. The resulting market prices fell sharply across the board, ranging from one yuan and three jiao to one yuan and eight jiao. The total transaction volume was more than 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading was sluggish due to the busy trading of public debt. There were many inquiries about shares of the Securities Exchange on the market, but there were no matching parties.

London Chinese foreign debt listed prices on the 10th of this month (Tuesday) were weak. British and French loans and British bond bills fell by another three pounds, priced at fifty-two pounds. Crisp bonds continued to fall by half a pound, priced at thirty-six pounds. Each of the Huguang Railway bonds fell by one pound. Non-German-issued bonds were twenty-three pounds, and German-issued bonds were twenty-one pounds. Yesterday's opening trading included a British gold settlement bond and a German-issued bond, with a transaction price of forty-seven pounds. The spot supply of British gold settlement bonds was quite lively.

### Finance - Pure Gold and Long Foreign Exchange Are Tight - Cooked Gold Rises Another Seven Yuan - Closed at the Highest Price Yesterday

Yesterday's after-hours market for cooked gold cash saw prices continue to rise. This was because British and American pure gold had reversed from falling to rising, the domestic market for foreign exchange in this city was soft, and a certain money exchange business was actively purchasing on behalf of clients. As a result, the confidence of all parties was further enhanced. Although silver houses and gold shops frequently tried to suppress prices along the way, they did not have any impact. As a result, it continued to rise by 7 yuan. Trading was quite brisk in the morning and quiet in the afternoon. There was no change in jewelry gold. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold have stopped falling and rebounded.

Cash Customers Make Aggressive Advances

The initial opening price in the morning for each bar (ten taels) was 1,991 yuan, which was due to the appreciation of British pure gold and the good appetite of a certain money exchange business. At that time, sellers were scarce. Then, after 9:45, silver houses began to sell, with a certain money exchange business purchasing a total of 100 taels from silver houses, opening at a price of 1,991 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange was reported to be weakening, so the price rose again by several yuan. A certain money exchange business purchased another 50 taels from silver houses at a price of 93 yuan. The same price was paid by gold shops to money exchange businesses for 50 taels. Money exchange businesses traded 50 taels at 95 yuan. After that, a stalemate gradually developed. Money exchange businesses traded another 20 taels at 93 yuan. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange business at 94 yuan. Finally, a gold shop sold another 20 taels to a money exchange business at 93 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. Trading was even quieter in the afternoon due to the lack of market for foreign exchange on Wednesday and the scarcity of sellers. However, the appetite of a certain money exchange business was still good, so prices rose several yuan again. After 3:00 PM, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business at 95 yuan, and another 50 taels at 96 yuan. After that, the supply and demand became even scarcer. Since there was still no opening trade at 4:00 PM, the closing price for the evening was still 1,996 yuan, a surge of 7 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The price of cash shop's brand name gold was 2,005 yuan when sold to retail buyers and 1,990 yuan when bought in, and it did not open lower compared to the listed gold of fifty yuan.

The Exchange Rate for Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged

The exchange rate for silver house jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. Datong Hang still quoted the original price of 202 yuan, and Xintong Hang quoted 200 yuan when selling and 194 yuan when buying.

The British Exchange Recovers Weakness and Pure Gold Rebounds

According to a London telegram on the 10th, British pure gold was affected by the weakness of the British exchange, so it rebounded by four and a half pence per ounce, reaching Â£7 9 shillings. The central bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold also rebounded to 1,216 yuan, 3 jiao. The listed customs gold also rose by 6 li, totaling 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and 3 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 3 yuan, totaling 1,211 yuan, 6 jiao.

### Heavy Demand for Foreign Currencies

Yesterday, British gold rose by four "ban shi", the British-American exchange rate increased by 0.0625, foreign exchange settlements were very active, and the demand from Japanese banks was quite strong. However, supply was not smooth, so the trend was weak. The Chaozhou and Guangzhou banking groups were actively seeking funds, but the amount of available funds was small and the supply was limited. The market price gradually increased with a strong upward trend. There was heavy demand for foreign currencies at the retail level, all trending upwards, presenting a firm and active market. There was some trading activity in the guild. Yi Kang issued a British gold bill of 30 pounds to Cheng Tai. They also issued a U.S. dollar bill of 100 yuan to Shanghai Yin Hao. Ying Feng issued a Hong Kong bill of 200 yuan to Shanghai Yin Hao. They also issued a Hong Kong bill of 600 yuan to Hong Yu. Jin Da issued a U.S. dollar bill of 900 yuan to San Tai. Bao Cheng issued a British gold bill of 100 pounds to Tong Feng. The market prices yesterday were as follows: British gold pounds rose by 2 jiao, British gold bills rose by 2 jiao, U.S. dollar pounds rose by 1 jiao, U.S. dollar bills rose by 2/3 of a fen, Hong Kong bills rose by 1 fen, French franc bills rose by 1 li, Singapore bills and Dutch bills both rose by 3 fen, rupee bills, Canadian bills, and Philippine bills all rose by 2 fen, and Australian gold bills rose by 2 jiao. Only Annam bills, Italian bills, German gold bills, and Siamese bills remained unchanged.

### Japanese Traders Actively Buying Foreign Exchange, British-American Exchange Rates Continue to Weaken, Hong Kong Exchange Rate Particularly Tight

Yesterday's exchange market saw a slight outflow of Hong Kong telegraphic transfers, but due to active buying by foreign firms and Sassoon, a Western trading company, as well as active absorption by a certain Japanese bank, and tight supply from various foreign banks, the underlying trend continued to weaken. The Hong Kong exchange rate was particularly tight, with extremely active trading.

In the early morning, the London large silver bar and New York silver prices remained unchanged. London spot gold recovered by 4.5 "ban shi". The exchange rate for British pounds against U.S. dollars was up by 3 li, against French francs up by 15 centimes, and against Shanghai unchanged. The U.S. dollar rose against the British pound by 0.0625, against French francs remained flat, and against Shanghai decreased by 3 fen. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The bank opened early, with the spot selling price for British exchange at 8.746875 "ban shi", and for U.S. exchange at 16.46875 yuan, both flat compared to the previous close. After the opening, Chinese banks engaged in some trading. Telegrams from abroad indicated a large sale of U.S. dollars at 16.5 yuan, and foreign firms also began buying actively, immediately creating a tight market. The U.S. dollar settled at only 16.4375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates and the silver equalization tax announcement remained unchanged. Subsequently, due to active competition among foreign firms and Sassoon, and increased buying by Japanese banks, coupled with tight supply from foreign banks, the situation became increasingly tight. British gold weakened to 8.4375 "ban shi", the U.S. exchange rate rose to 16.40625 yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate tightened to 56.5 yuan due to good bank purchases. Near noon, exchange shops repeatedly sold Hong Kong exchange, but foreign firms continued to absorb it well, so the situation softened slightly. At noon, exchange shops were less willing to supply, and the rate tightened again to 56.375 yuan. The bank's selling price at noon was 8.421875 "ban shi" for British exchange and 16.40625 yuan for U.S. exchange. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate tightened by 0.046875, the U.S. exchange rate weakened by 0.0625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate tightened by 0.0625. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The trading records for Tuesday are listed below.

### Indian Silver Nears Longer Terms, Large Bars Unchanged

A London telegram dated the 10th stated that speculators were selling while India was buying, resulting in a stable market. After closing, the market remained flat. At the listed price, there were some sellers. The large silver bar's near and far terms remained unchanged. A New York silver telegram stated that the U.S. silver price remained unchanged with no real market activity. Furthermore, a Bombay silver telegram indicated mixed movements in Indian silver, with spot and near terms rising by 1 anna, while longer terms retracted by 2 annas.

### Discount Rate Recovers to 7.5 Jiao

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts slightly recovered, initially hovering around 29 yuan per 1,000 yuan, eventually firmly standing at 29.5 yuan, a recovery of 7.5 jiao compared to the previous day.

### Food: Little Improvement in Flour and Wheat

Yesterday, the spot flour market remained stable. Sales from both northern and southern merchants were decent, but sales from major merchants were temporarily difficult to expand due to high transportation risks and lack of profit. Factories, however, felt that production and inventory were insufficient, and had the intention to raise prices. As a result, the price remained unchanged, with the Shantou-Minnan and Hebei-Shandong merchant groups each selling over 10,000 bags. There were also retail sales of around 8,000 bags, mostly Che Chuan brand and Tian Zhu Yu Weng No. 2 flour, with a selling price of 4.9 jiao. 9,200 bags of flour will be exported to Xiamen today (12th), and 1,000 bags to Shantou. 2,000 bags of bran will be shipped to Xiamen, and 4,000 bags to Xingang.

Yesterday, wheat arrivals by train and wheel totaled over 2,000 bags. Factories continued to show little interest due to cheap overseas wheat prices and price cuts by foreign flour. The domestic wheat market was sluggish. Total transactions were only 6,000 bags, equally split between Fuxin and Fufeng factories, at a maximum price of 6.7 yuan. There was little improvement in the market.

### Port Rice Falls by About 2 Jiao

1,500 bags to be shipped to Xiamen today.

Yesterday, domestic rice arrivals included 8-9 boats of river rice and 7-8,000 bags by train. Local merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and sales slowed further. Stockpilers took the opportunity to resell, further weakening the market. Transactions were minimal, with thick and thin japonica rice falling by another 1-2 jiao, and Du Yang tip rice also declining by several fen to 1-2 jiao. Port rice fell more sharply, by about 2 jiao, due to the influence of guest rice. Bian Yuan rice also fell by 1 jiao. Yin Yuan rice, however, remained scarce, with Jiangyin rice opening at 13.6 yuan, only 2 jiao below Bian Yuan rice. Today, 1,500 bags of rice will be shipped to Xiamen.

### Nanjing Xian Rice Remains Stalled

Guest Xian rice arrived by both train routes. Sellers aimed to adjust prices according to the market, but local merchants showed little interest due to the high supply and low prices of river rice. Both guest and stockpilers were sluggish, with only a few hundred bags transacted at a price reduction of 4-5 fen. High Wu Xian rice maintained a price of 10.04 yuan, while medium quality rice was weak. Sellers of Nanjing Xian rice were unwilling to sell cheaply, so prices remained high.

### Yarn and Cotton: Many Scatter, Hasty Settlements, Yarn Prices Fall Sharply, Each Brand Falls Around Ten Yuan, Japanese Yarn Changes Along with Chinese Yarn

The yarn market continued to slump, and the decline showed no sign of abating. The continuous surge in actual green prices had been too drastic, and coupled with strong absorption by fellow traders, a slightly unfavorable environment triggered hasty settlements. At the same time, customer sales could not be said to be small. Given the fluctuating market prices, it was natural to temporarily avoid risk and reduce purchases. As a result, scattered bulls and those with small profits rushed to sell, resulting in a temporary oversupply in the market, and prices plummeted. But in reality, there should have been a rebound correction to facilitate actual transactions. Instead, prices were raised higher and higher without end. The market conditions yesterday were as follows: (The opening was stagnant, with the opening price increased by 5 jiao. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 392 yuan. Ten bales were transacted among traders. Customer demand was insufficient, and floating holders competed to sell, shrinking the market further to a low of 382 yuan. Then, due to the low price, a certain company came to absorb, and the market rebounded by 2 yuan, closing at 384 yuan. However, small transactions continued among Yunnan and Wenzhou traders. The total transactions in the morning were 854 bales, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn down 7.5 yuan from the previous day, Te Jin Cheng down 12 yuan, Double Earth down 9 yuan, Tian Nu down 9 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn down 8 yuan. Factories remained inactive. 89 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 170 pieces to Shantou, and 140 pieces to Hong Kong yesterday. The quantities bought by each group are listed below:

Traders 495 Ningbo 7

Yunnan 125 Xiamen 5

Shantou 35 Wenzhou 175

Fuzhou 2 Jiangxi 10

Total 854

The Japanese yarn market was entirely determined by the changes in Chinese yarn, but its range of fluctuations was only one-tenth of that of Chinese yarn. Yesterday, the spot price of 20-count Suiyue yarn was 311 to 311.5 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn was 309 to 308.5 yuan, both down 2.3 yuan from the previous day, but transactions were sluggish.

### Dasheng Factory in Major Cotton Producing Area Purchases Tongzhou Cotton in Shanghai, Distorted Phenomenon After Control, Chinese Factories Order 6,000 Bales of Indian Cotton

The native cotton business saw a price decline of about 1 yuan due to factory closures, largely due to continuous price increases and a decline in the yarn market. The American and Indian cotton markets also saw declines, making them relatively cheaper. Even the once-powerful coarse cotton was affected by Indian cotton and weakened. Factories' order quantities gradually increased. There were no transactions in daily cotton. Japanese factories had no intention of touching high-priced Chinese cotton. Strangely, the Nantong Dasheng Factory, located in a cotton-rich area, was unable to purchase raw materials and instead came to Shanghai to purchase 1,000 bales of Tong cotton for use in its Nantong factory. This distorted phenomenon highlights the difficulties faced by factories. Hongzhang Factory only purchased 61 pieces of 42-count native cotton, with the rest being transactions among traders or offset against other transactions. The supply from northern Jiangsu was smooth, with 1,390 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 225 bales of Changyinsha cotton, 200 bales of wood rack cotton, and 390 pieces of North Sha cotton arriving. The current market is listed below:

Foreign cotton prices: American cotton has been falling for several days, leading to large quantities of cotton being pledged at loan offices, reducing the availability of cotton in the market. Currently, all industries are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market, awaiting confirmation from Washington. Yesterday, the New York cotton market rose initially due to positive news from Liverpool, but then weakened due to selling by New Orleans and profit-taking by bulls, resulting in a decline of 3-4 "bang yin" compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 1 rupee, while Egyptian cotton fell by over 40 "bang yin". The exchange rate softened yesterday, and when converted to legal tender, all foreign cotton prices fell, with American, Brazilian, and Indian cotton each falling by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton falling by over 2 yuan.

Foreign cotton transactions in this city: Due to the high prices and lack of available quantities of native cotton, Chinese factories showed strong interest in purchasing foreign cotton. Some Chinese factories had already placed orders under stringent conditions, while others were still resisting purchases. Yesterday, Japanese factories held meetings and did not engage in large-scale transactions. The transaction amounts and current spot market prices are listed below:

### Oilseed Cakes Plummet with Oil

Yesterday, Dalian soybean oil futures and spot prices both turned downwards. This was due to the decline in the Dalian market, as well as the influence of exchange rates, leading to a lack of confidence and a sharp drop in the market. One-month forward contracts first opened at 27.4 yuan, down 3 jiao from the previous day. Then, floating stockpilers sought to sell, causing the price to plummet to 27.1 yuan. The market remained weak at closing. Spot oil also fell by 2 jiao, but Yanqi oil rose by 1 jiao due to scarce supply and active sales. Transactions included 50 barrels of Dalian oil, 100 barrels of one-month upper delivery contracts, and over 350 barrels of one-month lower delivery contracts. There were also 400 pieces of Dalian Qidou oil, 50 barrels of Juese Fengnian oil, 1,000 cans of Suifeng factory canned soybean oil, and 100 pieces of Yanqi oil. Exports included 700 pieces of crude oil to Xiamen, 1,440 cans and 350 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Soybean Cakes Break Through the 3 Yuan Barrier

Yesterday, under the tight grip of owners, the soybean cake market broke through the 3 yuan barrier. Transactions included 2,500 pieces of Daya factory's Four-brand cakes at a price of 3.02 yuan, purchased by Xiamen merchants. 500 pieces were shipped out. Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants purchased 1,000 pieces of Changzhou Xiefeng factory's Five-brand cakes at a price of 2.85 yuan, and over 1,700 pieces of Jiangbei small soybean cakes. The current trend is influenced by the shortage of Changzhou Four-brand cakes, as well as the low supply of factory cakes. Prices have broken through the barrier, and the market remains active.

Today, 1,100 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Shantou, 1,210 bags to Xiamen, and 1,900 bags to Hong Kong.

### Dried Goods: Extremely Scarce Hunan Lotus Seeds, Even Worm-Eaten Lotus Seeds Fetch Good Prices

Hunan lotus seeds were difficult to obtain and arrivals were scarce, so market inventories were dwindling, and prices were soaring. The previous market price had reached 125 yuan, but recently it has become even scarcer, pushing prices higher. Yesterday, local lake lotus seeds reached 130 yuan, remaining active. Even worm-eaten goods fetched 75 yuan, highlighting the scarcity of goods. (Yesterday's news about the continued arrival of Hunan lotus seeds was mistakenly printed as lake lotus seeds and Chao lotus seeds; this is hereby corrected.)

Yesterday's imports included 120 bags of walnuts, 70 bags of peach kernels, and 160 bags of dates, all shipped from Tianjin.

Today's exports include 500 bags of raw kernels to Xiamen, and 560 bags to Hong Kong.

### Fruits: Large Shipment of Oranges Arrives in Shanghai

The day before yesterday, over 1,100 boxes of oranges arrived from Fuzhou. Yesterday, another 10,760 boxes arrived from Xiamen, and over 1,170 pieces of kiln goods arrived from Shantou.

### Piece Goods: Supply of Grey Cloth Not Sustained, Factories Temporarily Delay Offering Colored Twill, High Prices of Domestic Cloth, New Transactions Slightly Reduced, Sales of Eastern Piece Goods to Dyeing Industry Remain Strong

Domestic Cloth: The market was stable. After the surge in sales prices of fine cloth and fine twill, purchases slackened somewhat. Sellers were willing to slightly loosen the price by 1-2 jiao per piece to sell off hand goods. The supply of Cannon Brand fine cloth, produced by Tianjin Hengyuan Factory, was lacking. Merchants from Ningbo and Taizhou showed interest and purchased around 150 pieces of futures contracts for this month. The market remained particularly strong. The coarse cloth market showed signs of recovery. Merchants from Shanghai and Ningbo and Shaoxing purchased over 100 bales of Ewo goods and sold at the original price. The supply of goods was slightly low. Tong Yi's brand of 14-pound coarse cloth was purchased by traders, and the market price returned upwards. Underwear from brands like Zhenzhong and Jiufu each rose by 1 jiao per piece. Sales were mostly for previously ordered goods that had yet to be delivered, and tight credit and high market prices reduced new transactions. However, because the supply of grey cloth for colored twill was not sustained and demand was strong, factories temporarily delayed offering it for sale and focused on delivery. Ouhai, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line had the largest shipments. Sichuan merchants were also active, continuing to purchase over 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, printed cloth, and colored yarn. 800 pieces of colored twill were shipped overseas to Singapore.

Eastern Cloth: The morning market continued its downward trend, but the afternoon market rebounded slightly. Fine cloth was down another 1 jiao per piece from the previous day, and fine twill was down about 5 fen. Merchants from Tianjin purchased and sold in small quantities, with little addition. Other merchants took a wait-and-see attitude, and there were not many transactions. Only the local dyeing industry group continued to purchase actively, taking advantage of low prices to absorb goods without holding back, as the sales of colored cloth remained strong. Yesterday, a major wholesaler purchased 500 pieces of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth in bulk. There were also 400-500 pieces of scattered dye blanks sold. The traders said that even though the market was small, prices remained firm.

Exports: Today's exports of piece goods include 38 pieces to Shantou, 33 pieces to Xiamen, and 11 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Seafood: Flying Unicorn Starch Sales Greatly Increased

Flying Unicorn brand starch is exclusively sold to Western medicine merchants. In previous years, sales were not high, so the local inventory was scarce. The usual market price was above 20 yuan. As the new goods are about to arrive and production has greatly increased, large shipments are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. Currently, the price of this brand of starch has fallen to 17 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Luzon Betel Nut Peel Supply Uninterrupted

Betel nut peel from Luzon previously sold for 115 yuan. Because it was profitable, the arrival of goods was continuous. Currently, local inventories are abundant, but sales have slowed down. The day before yesterday, only a few dozen pieces were sold, and the price was down by over 20 yuan. The market was flat.

### Imports and Exports: Tung Oil Comes from Ningbo

Yesterday, 3,330 pieces of silkworm cocoons and 6,060 cans of tung oil arrived from Ningbo. Today's exports include 1,600 pieces of native paper and 200 pieces of tea to Qingdao.

Supplementary Education Association Sets Youth Self-Cultivation Implementation Methods, and Formulates Self-Cultivation Curriculum Distribution Table

The "Outline of Vocational Youth Behavior Training" formulated by the Shanghai Supplementary Education Association has been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the Youth Self-Cultivation Implementation Method is listed below:

Article 1: Member schools of this Association should add self-cultivation class time from this year, at least 15 minutes per week. The methods can adopt one of the following: 1. 15 minutes per week per subject. If the teacher of the subject has research on youth self-cultivation, the teacher of each subject will be responsible. 2. 15 minutes per week per subject, taught by full-time teachers in rotation. 3. Within the same time, all students in each subject should be divided into several groups according to similar levels and taught together for one hour. 4. Within the same time, all students in each subject are taught together for one hour. This method is quite problematic in terms of student level. Note: No matter which method is used, the arrangement of teaching materials should have a strict system, and students should have prescribed reading materials. It is not advisable to talk at will, resulting in superficial and empty content.

Article 2: Member schools of this Association should pay attention to student behavior training. The methods can adopt several of the following: (1) Setting behavioral standards; (2) Holding individual talks; (3) Training leading students; (4) Guiding collective organizations; (5) Instructing collective work; (6) Encouraging each other to improve and help each other; (7) Implementing self-criticism; (8) Promoting the spirit of hard work; (9) Maintaining the continuity of behavior.

Self-Cultivation Curriculum Distribution Table: Level 1: Basic Morality; Level 2: Service Morality; Level 3: Skill Cultivation; Level 4: Physical Cultivation; Career Problems; Level 5: Introduction to Career Outlook on Life, Introduction to Leaders; Level 6: Service and Life; Level 7: The Life of Struggle; Level 8: Youth and Leaders. Note: If a brief lecture method is used, each level is one semester; if a detailed lecture method is used, each level is one academic year. The above methods are just a rough outline. If there are better methods, it is okay to make changes.

### Suzhou Middle School Restores Senior High School Chemical Engineering Department

The Chemical Engineering Department of Suzhou Middle School has been established for many years and has achieved remarkable results. At the beginning of its establishment, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education stipulated that the chemical engineering department of the school should focus on the research of oils and fats and leather manufacturing. Up to now, three sessions have graduated. Graduates either work in various chemical factories in China and are quite competent, or they are admitted to the chemical engineering departments of famous universities to pursue further studies.

Now, in order to meet the needs of society, the school has decided to restore the senior high school chemical engineering department, first setting up one class for the first grade.

As a result, Guoguang easily defeated Tianxing with 50 to 33. Then, Taishan played against Zhizhi. The strengths of both sides were similar, and the competition was quite fierce.

### Motion and Stillness

â€” Cao Juren

â€”â€”Impressions of a Wartime Journey

One clear early winter morning, I climbed alone from Ehu Academy along the leaning pagoda to the peak of Fenghu Mountain. The morning sun had just risen, and the thick fog filled the valleys. The white camellias by the roadside were covered with dewdrops, which made them look particularly vibrant. That day, I didnâ€™t know whether it was because this famous place where the philosophers Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan had held their meetings had aroused my nostalgia for the past? Or was it because the cold and solemn atmosphere of early winter had stimulated my imagination? I felt a little different in my heart. I thought silently and walked slowly, thinking that Zhu and Lu had discussed their studies here in the past, with their own similarities and differences. They walked hand in hand, sometimes silent, sometimes arguing fiercely, sometimes in agreement. I wonder if they also thought that thousands of years later, from the same to the different, from the different to the same, many magnificent waves would be created?

Just as I was meditating and feeling at one with the spirit, the buzzing sound of an airplane in the air interrupted my thoughts. At that time, I suddenly changed my mind and raised the following question: Suppose Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan were both born in modern times, and Lu Zuqian (a master of the Jinhua School) who had some differences with Zhu and Lu also came to Ehu to participate in the discussion. When the three of them were arguing fiercely, and neither would give in, the enemy's plane came. What would be the attitude of the three of them? This is indeed worth thinking about. Lu Xiangshan might sit upright and look unchanged. Zhu Xi might think of the sage's way of exercising power and the ancientè¨“: "A gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall." Lu Fanqian, on the other hand, would probably immediately stop participating in the debate and feel that digging an air-raid shelter was more practical than philosophical debate. After the plane passed, who was right and who was wrong could be written on everyone's pen; but if the disciples in Ehu Academy were young people who were studying now, their judgment could be made immediately, because they believed that the enemy's plane would really drop bombs and blow Lu Jiuyuan, who was sitting upright, into meat pie. They would feel that the realistic path taken by the Jinhua School was the right path.

When going down the mountain, the spire of the leaning pagoda touched another thought in my mind: Ehu Academy, this Confucian holy land, and Hongji Temple on Fenghu Mountain, that Buddhist holy land, what kind of relationship do they have? Could it be that the leaning pagoda at the foot of the mountain is the dividing line between your territory and mine, and they will not glare at each other? Or Lu Xiangshan's attitude is closer to the side of Fenghu Mountain, Zhu Xi belongs to the circle of Ehu Academy, and Lu Zuqian is outside the circle of Ehu. Their disciples' attitude towards the monks in the mountain temple must be fundamentally different. If we continue to deduce in this way, the problem will become more and more complicated. That morning, a philosophy of life matured in my heartâ€”a philosophy of life in troubled times.

Between Fenghu Mountain and Ehu, there is a fundamentally different view of life. Buddhism advocates the beauty of stillness, taking "Nirvana" as the destination of life. Confucianism advocates the beauty of movement, taking "self-improvement" as "the great way of change. Lu is biased towards Buddhism, so he advocates "understanding the mind and seeing the nature. Zhu is biased towards Confucianism, so he advocates "exhausting the principles and dealing with things as one. Lu Zuqian, Ye Shuixin, Chen Tongfu and the Yan and Li schools in the early Qing Dynasty are closer to Confucianism, so they advocate "experiencing the world and studying the economy. (Economy refers to people's livelihood economy.) The beauty of stillness is easy to understand. People in middle age understand the taste of leisure and comfort even more. The beauty of movement, however, cannot be appreciated without the courage to face reality head-on. What comes with movement is a chaotic reality. People who are used to a leisurely life only know that chaos is just making fun of their life order. No old law can let him deal with it well. Turmoil makes him headache, and constant headaches. When he understands that under the turmoil, the stream of life is active, and that stream of life is leaping forward, it makes him feel headache again. Therefore, Zhu Xi is confined to the circle of Ehu, and Confucianism also only maintains itself in the doctrine of the mean. In troubled times, "the doctrine of the mean" is not enough. You must have a more positive attitude towards life.

As the Western saying goes, "Young people have more enthusiasm and less light, and middle-aged people have more light and less enthusiasm." The turbulent world is a world of fire. Only those who have more enthusiasm can catch up.

â€”â€”New Year's Day, 1939

### Evacuation

â€” Zhang Zhenshan

The bugle played a majestic tune atop the ancient city wall, the bayonets gleamed brightly in the rising sun; although it was the cold of winter, the morning breeze still carried some warmth, caressing that group of soldiers who had arrived last night.

I watched the soldiers running nimbly, busily dispersing into the various city streets and outskirts. That kind of impassioned and brave spirit made me realize that a fierce war of attrition was about to unfold here.

Indeed, time no longer permitted non-combatants to linger in this ancient city. The amiable military police also came to urge the people settled in their homes to evacuate to the surrounding countryside. The tense and solemn atmosphere diluted the selfish notions of a group of people and increased their awareness of displacement. Thus, we treated this ancient city wall as a friend bidding farewell on a journey and left it ordinarily.

Farewell, ancient city wall! In the future, when we return, the beautiful land will have been restored to its completeness, the powerful nation will have gained its freedom. On that devastated scorched earth, we will surely be able to rebuild a beautiful homeland! Now, filled with hopeful excitement, we can only support the frail elderly, lead the children, and follow the guiding military police, solemnly and orderly walking through the narrow city streets, passing through the half-collapsed archway of the city gate, squeezing through the crisscrossing barbed wire, and rushing to the thriving and prosperous rear!

Like flowing clouds, the crowds of people writhed on the empty country roads, scattered into who knows how many groups! Some climbed the high mountains, some skirted the forests, some crossed the shallow rivers, some had already disappeared beyond the reach of the human eye, hidden; only the troops arriving to set up defenses rushed forward like trains, their figures growing from small to large, marching in the opposite direction of the evacuating crowds, rushing to the positions surrounding the ancient city; those tightly packed and connected heroic soldiers, like the newly emerged wheat seedlings in the spring fields, revealed a vigorous and thriving spirit, and with the gentle sunlight shining on them, their greatness and nobility were even more apparent!

All of this added to the expectations of the non-combatants and strengthened the belief in victory among those being evacuated. In the tense atmosphere, everyone entrusted the mission of luring the enemy deep into the country to the ambushing groups of brave soldiers, everyone eagerly hoped that the empty dead city would become the tomb of the invaders.

Go, go! As I followed the last group of strong men evacuating and passed through the barbed wire, I occasionally looked back and gazed. Oh! On the ancient city wall, there was only solitude and emptiness, a different kind of sternness, a different kind of indifference, which made me shudder violently and quickened my pace to hurry forward.

On the cleared and fortified country roads, the number of people decreased with each step forward. By the time I could no longer see that ancient city, no longer see those fields and rivers, no longer hear the loud and solemn bugle, I was the only one left, walking alone on the rugged mountain road. The sun climbed to the top of the sky, transforming into a strong pale light. Intense

### The Veritable Record of a Beard

â€” Qiang

When I accidentally yawned, opening my mouth to exhale a bellyful of idle air, the corners of my eyes also wrinkled into 'a pool of autumn water'! (It should be solemnly declared: there are no flirtatious glances here. All my compatriots, please release your serious interpretations.) - Before I reached out to cover my face, I felt it was the most leisurely moment of spiritual refreshment since the start of the war of resistance.

But the situation was not that simple. 'The three paths are overgrown!' I immediately felt something 'thorny' on my upper lip, and not without 'domineering' tendencies.

In deep regret, I realized that this action was not an intentional provocation or a plot to subvert: it was just that after a 'yawn', there seemed to be such a move as a matter of course; the greatest effort, the ultimate task, was nothing more than massaging, appeasing the muscles after the movement, to see if they would 'submit'.

However, this - was not only superfluous, but indeed self-inflicted trouble, finding a few intractable strands of sorrow, causing a burst of grief.

'Looking in the mirror', I didn't have that courage; 'tracking' was even more troublesome; although China has stepped into a great era of transformation, people should have 100% 'positivity'. But I, this time, neither 'tracked' nor bothered to 'look in the mirror', which was a bit self-abandoning. In fact, why not tolerate this eccentricity? Moreover, let 'domineering' be 'domineering', I will be 'careful' with 'fire', and I will not fail to be a member of the post.

Raising a beard, it's a long story, and I still find it annoying.

Recalling the period of the Purification Movement, in the dormitory, there were indeed a few beards that had no 'rhythm' and whose 'structure' was not 'purely strange', and they were under serious surveillance. The interrogator felt that the evidence of the crime was insufficient and glared angrily. It is said that he also issued such an astonishing conclusion:

'Beards like thisâ€”seeing the behavior, being well-behaved is never well-behaved!'

At that time, although I didn't expect that 'Sima Guang' would later become 'Marx', I swept my smooth lip plate and, 'favored by nature', was overjoyed and settled down to find some extracurricular reading such as 'Sima Guang's 'Zizhi Tongjian' and other books.

However, whenever I think of those beards that were like weasels because of 'slovenliness' and a few unloved revisions, my heart can't help but thump and feel that 'saving the country should slightly forget the beard'.

Facts are the most eloquent. The more I 'don't forget', the more 'domineering' the beard becomes. Half a lifetime of floating and sinking, the few rare Qingchun style and some vigorous 'crazy and simple taste' have been swept away by a few desolate beards. In fact, why bother to circle around this physical problem.

However, friends tidying their collars and 'purifying the family', have not failed to think of eradicating the beard as 'the top priority' and 'getting to the root and clearing the source, nothing else can be done'. According to the reports of most experienced people, the more reliable standard technique is: rather than diligently weeding afterwards, it is better to uproot the seedlings from the front. Therefore: 'shaving is not as good as trimming; trimming is not as good as plucking'; a series of theories like strings of beads are naturally produced. The activists hold this 'fundamental cure' 'century-old plan' and apply it greatly to copper coins, 'nitpicking' on the respective lip plates. If there is a cause for 'eating slot machines', then at least it should be recognized that the copper coins for eating beards (tigers) are a 'one good turn deserves another' trace.

Since the passage of the proposal for a controlled economy, in a short period of time, there has been a problem of insufficient circulation of hard auxiliary coins in the market. Friends who have always used copper coins to clamp their beards to implement their ideas are naturally inseparable from this economic condition, and can't help but 'look at each other' and 'worry too much'. Although women and young ladies don't fail to sympathize with the beards 'no copper coins to soak in water' and easily take out a few from their waists to temporarily relieve the famine; however, using this warm copper coin to secretly pluck the beard will not only not feel 'gentle and affectionate', but in addition to 'copper stench', there will probably also be 'copper stench'.

Material conditions have caused most young beards to pick up scissors and make decisive decisions; but 'adhesive plaster', the father comes in tracking. Although this is an exceptional encounter, 'planning ahead', we should finally 'make do' a little.

In fact, these things are all self-inflicted troubles. Later, there was strong evidence that the short, small, and capable beard is the driving force behind all 'kissing'. This made many friends wake up, change their style, and cancel all the 'cutting' and 'plucking' claims that they had always maintained firmly. And the raw devouring and meaningless destruction that the beard had suffered before were all saved. Loving it and wanting it to live, shaving it and wanting it to be hard, frequency is a quick decision policy.

However, I myself am still a laggard, in the surging tide of 'plucking', I don't follow; in the increasingly intense tide of 'shaving', I don't trace. Finding the lip plate in the desolate weeds, leaving this wilderness in the world, what good is it?

### Divergent Paths (Part 1)

â€” Yun Zhan

Ermaozi raised his eyebrows and suddenly jumped up, pointing his finger directly at his wife's nose and roaring, "Bullshit! What did you say? What did you say!"

His wife fell silent, lowered her head, and patted the baby in her arms to feed him.

The child, who had been drowsily sucking on the nipple and about to fall asleep, was startled by his outburst and began to cry again.

"Why don't you tell me to go and be a robber, a thief? Wouldn't that be cleaner!"

His wife remained silent but raised her head to stare at him, her eyes filled with tears.

This softened Ermaozi. The child kept crying, and he felt that the air in the room was unusually restless. Ermaozi pushed open the window, exhaling deeply as he gazed at the sky.

There was a moon and stars in the sky, as well as drifting clouds, but in Ermaozi's eyes, it was just a blur.

With great difficulty, the child stopped crying, and his wife patted him and put him to bed. Only then did he turn around, looking at her thin back, the clothes from a year ago looking like they were hanging on a bamboo pole. He couldn't help but feel a wave of sadness, sighed deeply, and sat down silently.

His wife watched his face and slowly said, "I was just discussing it with you, it's not like I'm definitely telling you to go... Why do you always get so angry? Do you know how bad your temper has been lately?... When it comes to being a robber or a thief, it's all because there's no food to eat. I've never seen anyone with clothes to wear and food to eat going to rob or steal. But there are many people who take this path who are very respectable, very valued. Take Master Yang, for example, does he lack anything to eat or wear? Besides, if you go, you'll just be working by his side, it's not like he's directly telling you to be a slave and smile at people. It's also Liu Erge's kindness, running over to invite you, if you don't go, he's afraid he won't have any other friends? People can't even get this opportunity!" She sighed slightly, "With your temper, if Liu Erge knew, how could he save face?"

"What do you know? You always have so many crooked arguments!"

"I told you I was just discussing it with you... It's not like I'm rushing you, the rent is three months overdue, and we need firewood, rice, and pocket money every day! We've pawned everything, and there's nowhere to borrow from!... I know your temper, if we could barely get by, I would have already refused for you. Who doesn't want to hold their head high and live with dignity!" She paused for a while, "So I think we should have a way to make a living, we can't just open our eyes and wait to starve to death!"

Ermaozi frowned, not answering.

The air in the room seemed very heavy again.

A series of leather shoes sounded on the stairs, and someone came up.

"Er Mao brother!"

"Oh, Liu Erge!" His wife rushed to answer, letting him into the room.

Ermaozi greeted him, and seeing Liu Er wearing a new set of clothes, he couldn't help but feel a wave of disgust in his heart.

Unexpectedly, when Liu Er sat down, he also sighed, "Sigh! When there's nothing to do, you can't borrow a single penny; when they hear you have a job, they borrow twenty yuan in one go; and they even ask me if it's enough! You think, even your own relatives are so snobbish!"

"Ah, Erge, you're too difficult, it's not good to borrow, and it's not good not to borrow," his wife said quickly.

Ermaozi smiled slightly.

### On Knowing Contentment

â€” Mu Yi

People's desires are endless, especially those of ambitious young people! They only know how to envy and resent! They don't understand the words "contentment brings happiness." We must know that we should always strive for development, but we will never be able to get our way in one fell swoop. We should both take advantage of opportunities or pay attention to opportunities, and at the same time, we should always maintain an optimistic attitude and spirit. In this way, we can comfort ourselves. If you don't believe it, we can understand it by talking about our clothing, food, housing, and transportation!

When we are dressing, we must always want to wear silk that costs two or three yuan a foot, or a suit that costs more than a hundred yuan, but no, we must never have such wishful thinking. We only need ordinary clothes that can resist the cold and protect our bodies, which is enough. What's more, compared to those refugees who have no house to live in and no clothes to wear, or those ragged beggars, it is really much better.

When we are eating, we must always want to eat Western food, taste delicacies such as shark fin and sea cucumber, but no, we only need something that suits our taste, is hygienic, and can fill our stomachs. In this way, compared to those who have nothing to eat, or those who beg from door to door, it is already much better.

When we live in a house and sleep on a hard plank bed, we must always want to live in high-rise buildings or Western-style houses, and the best thing to sleep on is a Simmons spring bed, but no, we only need to be able to avoid wind and rain, sleep well, and be hygienic. Compared to those who have no place to live, hide in the alleyways, and sleep on the cement, it is really much better.

When we are sitting in a tram, seeing the streamlined cars speeding by, we also wish we could go out and sit in a car, and enter the door and sit in a car; but if we think of the rickshaw drivers and trishaw drivers who run around for life all day long, it is really much more fortunate.

### Chinese Cheongsam Popular Overseas

â€” Feifei

Most Chinese people like to wear Western clothes. According to those who like to wear Western clothes, there are two reasons: one is to show off and learn the current trends, as if wearing a suit and leather shoes can show that they are modern people. The other is to take advantage of its convenience and liveliness, because Western clothes are not only good-looking in form, but also lighter and more refreshing than long robes. However, on the contrary, some foreigners like to wear Chinese clothes; for example, many American women like to wear Chinese cheongsams, and they consider it a way to show off. Therefore, in recent years, China's silk fabrics have sold well in the United States, but unfortunately, the import tax in the United States is too high, and the tax on silk fabrics and embroidery is as high as 120%. For this reason, it is quite difficult for China's silk fabrics to be exported to the United States. Similarly, there are also many women in Japan who love Chinese cheongsams, and they are very popular.

Speaking of Japanese clothing, its forms and styles still follow the legacy of the Tang and Song dynasties in China. This kind of clothing is not only inconvenient, but also very cumbersome. The curves and lively postures of women are also completely concealed by it, which is really very ugly. For this reason, in recent years, Japanese women have also advocated the improvement of clothing, but because of long-standing habits, it has been ineffective. As a result, Chinese cheongsams became popular in Tokyo. At first, only geishas and cafe waitresses wore cheongsams; in recent years, the scope has become wider and wider. General new drama actors, movie stars, and even noble women are all competing to wear them, and gradually, this trend of liking to wear Chinese cheongsams has spread throughout the island nation.

But one thing is regrettable, that is, although Japanese women like to wear Chinese cheongsams, there is no tailor shop in Tokyo that specializes in making Chinese clothes. Although there are also a few Western clothing stores opened by Chinese people in Tokyo, they only know how to make Western clothes, and it is not very good for them to make Chinese clothes, especially cheongsams. If the style looks like it is behind the times in the eyes of Shanghai people, otherwise, if there were also a few fashion tailor shops in Tokyo that specialize in making Chinese clothes, which can innovate like Shanghai, I believe that Chinese cheongsams will still be popular in Japan for a while.

### Hitler Likes to Eat Eggs

â€” Qian Meng

People who do great things often take their daily lives the most lightly, are not concerned, and implement them in the simplest way; in fact, they use their energy in big places, so it is difficult to take care of trivial matters.

So Hitler was no exception. He did not haggle over everything in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, especially food, which was even more casual. He could eat any dish and eat it with relish, which was even more difficult!

He did not smoke or drink, that is to say, he had no bad habits; sometimes he only ate two meals a day, lunch and dinner; this determined the amazing amount of food he ate, he could finish the dishes for two meals at once! However, among many dishes, eggs accounted for the largest part of his diet, that is, he liked to eat eggs the most. He often ate eggs cooked in various ways; he had a dedicated chef who could cook eggs in more than 30 ways. If he needed to attend a meeting, he would order the chef to personally bring the eggs and slices of black sturgeon to cook; when he ate alone, he would simply boil the eggs for a while, which was his specially selected food! However, he also often ate fish, chicken, raw vegetables, and vegetables cooked with butter; in short, his meals were very casual!

Under this kind of nutrition, he gradually gained weight, and his physical strength gradually increased. His two jaws slowly hung down, and his abdomen was also undergoing abnormal inclined activity, which was too worrying for him, because he still wanted to be the dictator of Germany forever, even the world; but this was too harmful to his ambition!

Benito was very clear that the spirit of a great leader is closely related to his food preferences, so he once said like a theorem: "Ambitious people are absolutely not allowed to eat large amounts of steak"!

Hitler's sleep time was 10:00 pm. He often said: "Insufficient or too much rest, whether physically or mentally, is not beneficial to life, especially for those with great ambitions"!

News about eating Wu people like snacks, and they like to fill their stomachs with soup balls for breakfast, which can be more or less depending on the amount of food. In the past, before the war, there was a shop in Qiaojiazhai in Nanshi, which was famous for making soup balls. The soup balls they made had a firm and solid meat filling, and the powder was smooth and glutinous. When you bite into it, the meat soup splashed everywhere, and the taste was extremely delicious. Ordinary gourmets each bite off the skin, leaving the meat filling, and then add some vermicelli to serve as a meal, which is like a bowl of vermicelli meatball soup. There is also a kind of tendon-free vegetable dumpling, which was only sold in a shop at Sanpailou in the city 30 years ago. It is made with vegetarian vegetables without tendons, selecting the tender leaves, and then adding refined ingredients. It is fragrant, crispy, smooth, fresh, and delicious. In recent years, I have never seen other shops selling it. Recently, I heard that Qiaojiazhai Soup Ball Shop has reopened at No. 276 Alber Road, and there are also vegetable dumplings for sale. The telephone number for delivery is 73050. Ordinary gourmets can once again feast on them.

Notice from this magazine The manuscript fees for last month have been settled. All contributors, please bring a stamped slip and come to the accounting department of this museum from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm every day from the 16th (except Sundays) to collect it.

### One Week Economic Menu

â€” Ms. Hua Ying

The weather is cold, and water freezes into ice at night. This is the best time to make frozen tofu. You only need to buy a board of old tofu and put it in the patio or on the drying platform overnight. When you look at it the next morning, it will have frozen. If you are too lazy to do it yourself, then go to the tofu shop to buy it, you can also buy it, but the price will be more expensive; and you have to buy it early, because there are many people who like to eat frozen tofu, if you go late you will not be able to buy it. Frozen tofu is delicious whether it is cooked vegetarian or with meat. For vegetarian food, use fragrant mushroom tips, add good soy sauce, and cook with pagoda vegetables. You don't need to add seasonings, and it feels very delicious. It is also OK to cook meat with pork slices or diced meat, that is, mutton or beef. All auxiliary products can be added as much as possible to make a ten-scene casserole frozen tofu, which is especially delicious and endless. However, whether cooking with meat or vegetarian, you must add a lot of soup, because the soup here is also a delicious taste that you must try.

### Chairman Lin's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

â€” Zhang Zhenshan

The esteemed Chairman Lin, despite his advanced age and high position as Chairman of the National Government, does not seek comfort or luxury in his personal life due to his age, nor does he become arrogant or selfish because of his high office. He is not hypocritical, cruel, nor is he cowardly or reclusive. He is always upright, frugal, gentle, and kind, fully embodying the inherent virtues of the Chinese nation!

Whether he is working in the office or resting at home, he always wears a long robe and short jacket. In spring, it is a thin cotton robe of blue silk; in summer, a long white linen gown; in autumn, a thin silk cotton robe with a mandarin jacket; and in winter, a sheepskin robe with a black woolen overcoat. In spring, autumn, and winter, he always adds a blue cloth cover-up over his long robe to protect it from getting dirty. He only takes off the cover-up when attending National Government meetings or banquets hosted by important people. Therefore, the clothes he wears are always so clean and tidy. When there are grand ceremonies, such as the New Year's Day awarding of medals and the presentation of credentials by foreign ambassadors, he changes into a brand-new blue silk long robe and black satin mandarin jacket of national dress. The materials of these clothes are absolutely all domestic products. He has not bought a single imported item in nearly thirty years, which is also a merit that most people do not have.

His daily food is no different from that of ordinary people: a few vegetables, a bowl of white rice, and a bowl of thin porridge. Tofu and eggs are the most common among the vegetables. However, he has a standard for food, which is: "Hot, soft, and bland." Only food that meets these three conditions can he eat.

What does "hot, soft, and bland" mean? "Hot" means that whatever the food is, he will not eat it if it has lost its heat. "Soft" means cooked and tender. Vegetables must be cooked until soft over a low fire for a long time, perhaps because his teeth are not suitable for eating hard food. "Bland" means not salty, because if food is too salty, it will inevitably leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth and require drinking a lot of water, which can cause stomach bloating. This is also a hygienic issue worth noting.

The furnishings in his residence are very simple. The bedroom is almost the same as an ordinary person's bedroom: a bed, a square table, a desk, two chairs, and a coffee table. He rests, gets up, reads newspapers and books, and reviews personal letters in this small room. Because he loves antiques, he also displays some musical instruments, chess, calligraphy, paintings, vases, swords, stoves, fish tanks, etc. in his residence. The small vase on the desk was bought by himself on foot in an antique shop.

Speaking of the Chairman's transportation, we didn't often see him walking long distances in Nanjing. Therefore, we always thought that he couldn't walk much due to his age and weakness. But that is not the case. Every time the Central Committee holds a general meeting or on the Premier's birthday when visiting the mausoleum, he also walks on foot. He can walk that long Zhongshan Road and those many stone steps in front of the mausoleum, and he can also walk down the stone steps and return to his official residence. After a short rest, he can return to his state before walking. On the surface, he is an elderly man, but in fact, he has the energy and leg strength of a young man.

Last year in Guangxi, he traveled around the Guilin landscape with General Li Zongren, General Bai Chongxi, General Huang Xuchu, and other senior officials. He also walked a lot, and the more he walked, the more excited he became. The beautiful scenery made him forget the fatigue in his legs. "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world, that's right!" He praised the landscape with a loud and strong voice from time to time, and walked on and on.

Finally, we wish him good health, a long life, and may he always happily manage the affairs of the country!

### Anecdotes from the Singing Stage: Old Records of Marketing

â€” Junmei

I recently saw an article in a newspaper about Mei Lanfang's happy event, mentioning Mei's wife, Fu Lingzhi, etc. This should be a mistake for Fu Zhifang. Zhifang is of banner origin and studied under the Qingyi Wu Lingxian. Initially, she was not well-known. When she performed at the Chengnan Amusement Park, she was squeezed out by Jin Shaomei and was quite unsuccessful. Therefore, some people created the example of opening private performances for her to earn a living. The fact that she became Mei Lanfang's wife was due to the efforts of celebrities such as Luo Yinggong and Feng Gengguang. Initially, after Zhifang was rejected by Chengnan, she thought about finding someone to spend her life with. At that time, Mei Lanfang often visited Chengnan and greatly admired Jin Shaomei's performance. For a time, there were rumors that Mei would marry Jin Shaomei. Zhifang heard this and quickly asked her teacher Wu Lingxian to speak to Mei. Wu was also Mei's teacher, and he discussed the matter with Feng and Luo. With the strong urging of Wu, Feng, and Luo, this marriage was successful. At that time, Yinggong also wrote a congratulatory couplet "Lan and Zhi Fragrant Together" with a short poem, which was widely praised in the capital. Earlier, Mei's wife, Wang, had some objections to Mei taking Fu as a concubine, but because Feng, Luo, and others were powerful, she could do nothing about it. Zhifang's appearance was ordinary, and her performance in the Hua Dan role was also mediocre. However, Lanfang was able to lower himself and treat the common as divine, while the intelligent and beautiful Meng Xiaodong was eventually divorced. This cannot be understood by ordinary people.

Sun Juxian often showed frustration and discontent in his later performances, probably due to his circumstances. Sometimes, he even expressed it in his lyrics. When Sun performed at Jixiang Garden in old Beijing, he openly talked about his patriotic views in his dialogues. The audience responded with boos, but Sun remained indifferent. Finally, he inserted the line "I am talking about patriotism to deaf ears" into his lyrics, which caused a stir. If it were not for the reputation of the "old fellow villagers," he would have been insulted. However, Sun was also one of the actors with a sense of integrity!

In the old days, Jianghu troupes would perform a "book" (a complete opera) in one day, divided into four sections: morning show, main show, continuation, and evening show, with the main show being the most important. There was a man named Zhang Gong in my hometown who seemed foolish but not foolish, and seemed crazy but not crazy. He loved drinking and watching plays. No matter how far or near the villages were performing, Zhang Gong could disrupt the troupe. He would write down all the actors and plays, what the morning show was, and what the main show was, in chalk on the streets and alleys as an introduction. He could also predict the performances in advance. At that time, there were no playbills to communicate theater news in the inland, but Zhang Gong's reports within thirty to fifty miles of the Jianghu troupe's footprints were always accurate. For a time, he was called the "living playbill." Now the Jianghu troupes have dispersed like fleeting clouds, and Zhang Gong's tomb has been around for more than ten years. Those who love plays must feel the changes of the past and present!

### A Tale of the Pear Garden: Shang Xiaoyun Gifts the Famous Play to Wenqin

â€” Yu Yu

"The Daughter of Lanling" Performed by "The Daughter of Lanling"

In Shanghai, Jin Suqin is considered the best Kun Dan (female role), and her plays are considered the best. Zhang Wenqin is considered to have the most extensive knowledge of opera art. Suqin once studied under the old actor Wang Yaoqing, while Wenqin studied under Shang Xiaoyun. As for Mao Jianqiu, she used to promote herself as a "disciple of Mei," probably having studied under Huanhua. Wenqin's apprenticeship to Xiaoyun was on the Dragon Boat Festival in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) when Xiaoyun came to Shanghai to perform for the birthday celebrations of Chen Yong'an and Zhang Xiaolin. The introducers were Wu Xiao'an, a famous amateur actor from Jinan, and Pan Yongyi from the transportation industry. People congratulated Wenqin on finding a famous teacher. When Xiaoyun returned north, Wenqin went to the station to see her off. Xiaoyun told her before parting, encouraging her to work hard in her art and said that after arriving in Peiping, she would send her a new private play as a gift, hoping she would take good care of it.

The complete new plays that Wenqin now performs, such as "Leifeng Pagoda," "Pearl Fan," "Longevity Mirror," and "Three Mothers Teach Their Son," were all obtained from Xiaoyun. Recently, Wu Xiao'an went from Shandong to Tianjin. He happened to meet Xiaoyun performing in Tianjin. During their happy meeting, he admired Xiaoyun's new play "The Daughter of Lanling." He said to Xiaoyun, "The 'Daughter of Lanling' you perform is a story about Lanling, and your female disciple Zhang Wenqin is also from Lanlingâ€”Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, formerly known as Nanlanling County. Why don't you give this play to her to perform on stage? Wouldn't that be a wonderful story in the Pear Garden?" Xiaoyun applauded and said it was a good idea. Yesterday, I met Zhang Wenqin and saw the outline of "The Daughter of Lanling." The plot tells the story of Ouyang Jingfan, a wealthy man from Lanling, whose daughter Shufang is beautiful and virtuous, known as the Daughter of Lanling. Ouyang and Bai Sheng's father are close friends. Bai studies at Ouyang's house and is classmates with Shufang. Ouyang promises to marry his daughter to him. After Bai's father dies, Ouyang disavows the engagement and promises her to a wealthy family because Bai is poor. Bai asks Zhang, a hunchbacked matchmaker, to propose marriage, but Ouyang refuses. Zhang offers a plan to elope. Bai initially refuses, but is persuaded by Zhang. Shufang is also angry at her father's reneging on the engagement and is persuaded by Zhang's sweet words. She gives Zhang a phoenix hairpin as a token. Each holds one branch, promising that after escaping, they must maintain proper conduct until Bai achieves fame and completes the marriage. Zhang's nephew, Luo Xi, is a rogue who pretends to be Bai to welcome Shufang. Shufang falls for his trick. On the way, he tries to take advantage of her. Just then, government patrols pass by. Luo pushes Shufang into a dry well and tries to escape, but is caught. Gradually, Shufang is rescued by Grandma Liu. Grandma Liu tells her nephew Liu Ren to retrieve the lost package. Liu goes with his friend Mo Long. Mo, seeing the money, kills Liu and pushes the body into the well. Ouyang, seeing his daughter elope at night, suspects that Bai lured her and sues him to the authorities. Magistrate Qin Gonglang is honest and upright. He questions Luo Xi and learns the whole story, knowing that Bai is innocent. He disguises himself as a fortune teller and visits privately. Shufang sees that Liu Ren has not returned with the package and asks Grandma Liu to investigate. She sits alone by the fence, lamenting her fate. Qin, disguised as a fortune teller, arrives. Shufang asks him to divine her past. At this time, Grandma Liu also returns, crying over the dead body. Qin learns the whole truth of the case. Later, he discovers that Mo Long killed Liu Ren based on the phoenix hairpin. He arrests and punishes Mo. Bai achieves fame. Qin presides over the marriage, and the young couple treat Grandma Liu well to repay her kindness for saving their lives. The whole play depicts the joys and sorrows of life, and is very vivid. Wenqin has obtained this excellent script and is reciting the lines. It will definitely be seen on stage in the future. The Daughter of Lanling" performed by "The Daughter of Lanling" is truly a wonderful story of the Pear Garden. Shang Xiaoyun and Zhang Wenqin

### Appreciation of Dance (Middle)

â€” Jiasheng

3.  Content and Posture of Dance

The posture of the dance changes with the content. Therefore, appreciating dance should compare its content with its posture. For example, the content of classical dance is religious worship, so you have to see if its posture is solemn, elegant, and simple. At the same time, you also need to connect the dance with the national characteristics from which it originated. For example, for German dance, is its line rough? Is the posture of French dance beautiful? Is English dance old-fashioned? And is Russian dance generous?

4.  Stage and Lighting

Lighting increases the special effect of stage dance. For example, when we look at the "Basda Harvest Dance," the yellow and red lights are used to express the facial expressions of the dancers, as if they are a group of farmers moving and laughing under the sun. Then, in addition to watching the dancers' postures, we also have to appreciate the mood of the lights they use. If a happy and lively dance is matched with dull lighting, then the effect of its posture will be reduced below the horizontal line.

5.  Dance and Musical Accompaniment

The steps of the dance completely depend on the push of the music rhythm, so music becomes an objective requirement of dance. Then, the interests of the music must adapt to the mood and background of the dance. Otherwise, not only will the dance effect be unsound, but it will also reduce the dancer's emotions. Therefore, the music arrangement of the dance should not only seek the harmony of the rhythm, but also make the interests of each other harmonious. And a dance should have music specially made for it, otherwise it will harm its effect. It is said that a few years ago, at the ballroom of the Beijing Six Nations Hotel, the music arranged for a Chinese female dancer's "Greek Goddess Dance" and a male dancer's "Spanish Knight Dance" completely deviated from the original dance's interest, and I know this music. Because this music is not dance music, but modern pure music, using pure music to arrange the postures and movements of "Knight" and "Goddess" is tantamount to not recognizing the connectivity of music and dance. Therefore, in addition to appreciating the dance itself, we also need to examine the music arrangement.

6.  Dance Movements

The lines of dance movements are also determined by its content. In the 16th and 17th centuries, people paid attention to form, so the lines of classical dance also focused on the formal beauty of small postures, the so-called fine line dance. At the same time, various dances of this era were created from the basic principles of common steps. The 18th century advocated the development of human personality, so the lines of romantic dance tried to individualize it as much as possible, and the movements were more free. In the 19th century, dance was influenced by impressionism, so its movements sought to blur the lines. As for modern times, because of the demand for the expression of power, the lines and postures of dance focus on the large movements of the outline, the so-called three-dimensional rough line dance, and collective dance is used as a unit. Therefore, it can be seen that the appreciation of dance should be compared with its content.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City Pear Garden (7) (2)

â€” Xu Muyun

Lord Donggao Excels at the Art of Changing Faces

In addition, there is another difficulty, which is singing. The singing, percussion, and stringed instruments must all be in sync. If one of the three is slightly faster or slower, then they will clash. (Singing actors are most afraid of clashing with the background music; if they clash, they will surely go off-key). The above discussion only concerns the singing part. When it comes to expression, it is even more difficult. Because Wu Zixu has great hatred for his parents and brothers, but in this opera, there is no individual or object to vent it on. Therefore, all the acting techniques such as blowing one's beard and staring eyes cannot be used. Expressions without an object in the play are the most difficult to perform. Initially, Wang Guifen was good at having two large eyes. He could completely express his full of anger between his eyebrows and eyes. No wonder this play was his masterpiece.

The most feared thing in opera is a dead face, "no eyes." A dead face means that regardless of joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, grief, fear, surprise, or worry, it is all that one face. "No eyes" means that the eyes are naturally small and cannot convey the spirit. Although there are two eyes, they are simply useless on stage. This is called "no eyes," and it is not the same as a blind person who cannot see anything at all. If that were really the case, how could they perform on stage? In the past, old Tan suffered from having small eyes and lacking ferocity. Fortunately, his face had acting skills, so it was not a big problem. However, he knew how to hide his shortcomings. Therefore, he never performed "Zhaoguan." Now, except for Ju Peng, other old Tan school actors do not perform it much, also because there is no way to follow it.

Most people think that Wu Zixu's beard turned white due to sorrow in "Wen Zhaoguan." Even I have asked several knowledgeable celebrities, and they all agree. One year, I met an old opera lover. During the banquet, he suddenly raised this question, and everyone at the table was stumped. Finally, he expressed his high opinion: "According to me, Zixu's beard was turned white by Lord Donggao using the art of changing faces. Look at Lord Donggao's introduction; he said that he was a disciple of Bian Que in his youth. When he saw Zixu, Fu mentioned his esteemed teacher, but he never mentioned what position he held in the court in the past. This shows how much Lord Gao valued his teacher. Bian Que was a famous doctor in ancient times, truly capable of bringing the dead back to life. Gao respected his teacher so much, so his medical skills can be imagined. He kept Zixu in the back garden and did not meet him for seven days, but he added aging drugs to his diet and spied on Zixu's appearance through the window at night to see if it had changed. Zixu originally had great hatred in his heart, so he was naturally frowning. Lord Gao's medicine worked, and with Zixu's anxiety and worry, the two combined to attack, so he was able to turn his beard and hair completely white in a short period of seven days. Although the opera lyrics do not explicitly mention Lord Gao's prescription, those who listen to the Chu opera cannot but carefully ponder it. The ancients often liked to keep secrets and play dumb riddles when writing books and operas. Who knows if the person who wrote this play was playing a dumb riddle for future generations to guess?" Because I thought what this opera fan said made a lot of sense, I announced Lord Gao's magical art."
