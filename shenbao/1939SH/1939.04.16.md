Total Counteroffensive by All Chinese Armies - Japanese Side Greatly Panicked - 1.5 Million Troops Engaged in Battle, Resistance Strength Increasingly Strengthened, Absolutely No Reason to Negotiate Peace Now, Aggressors Will Reap What They Sow - (London) While the local newspapers are extremely focused on European events, they all prominently feature news of the general offensive by the Chinese army today. According to several dispatches, the Chinese are using 1.5 million troops along a 1,500-mile front in this offensive. Observers are reluctant to make hasty judgments, but believe that such a large-scale operation is bound to make the Japanese uneasy. The Times' Beijing dispatch speaks of the Sino-Japanese war, particularly detailing the victory of the Chinese army in central Hebei province, saying that the Japanese in central Hebei are completely unable to fully control the area to carry out their main purpose of planting cotton. Currently, all sectors in China and Japan are watching with great interest British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's trip to Chongqing. The Japanese are speculating that Ambassador Clark Kerr may be carrying proposals to Chongqing to lead to a Sino-Japanese truce as a result of his meeting with British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie. The fact that Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi visited the British Foreign Office twice this week has also aroused the attention of the Japanese side. However, according to Reuters, Guo's visit to the British Foreign Office was merely a routine action without any special significance. The Chinese side is strongly denying any talk of China making concessions and negotiating peace, saying that the war situation is now gradually turning in China's favor, and there is absolutely no need to negotiate peace at present. According to a Hong Kong dispatch from the Daily Express, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's purpose in going to Chongqing is to provide Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek with some methods that can immediately strengthen China's resistance strength. According to the correspondent, people in political and military circles in China believe that strengthening China's resistance strength will keep Japan busy dealing with the Eastern war and unable to spare any effort, and unable to be a factor in the Western Allied plan. People in the Japanese side with informed sources say that the majority of those in charge in Japan do not agree to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact, because Japan joining the European vortex would be more harmful than beneficial. Unless attacked by the Soviet Union, Japan would never want to join. The Times' Rangoon dispatch states that recently about 400 Chinese truck drivers and mechanics, funded by patriotic overseas Chinese in Malaya, were sent back to China to serve. They have now arrived here via Singapore and will drive trucks on the Yunnan-Burma Road to facilitate transportation. These people are all wearing blue uniforms and are agile, attracting much attention. The Daily Mail publishes an editorial congratulating China on its recent victories in the war, saying that the end of the war is still far away, but the general offensive in the spring of the third year of the Sino-Japanese War has shown that those who want to conquer China are suffering endlessly.

Editorial: Constructing Sound School Moral Education - The Ministry of Education of the National Government, within a month after the conclusion of the National Education Conference, convened another Moral Education Discussion Meeting, resolving many important cases. The schools in Shanghai today most need sound moral education, but in fact they are most lacking in sound moral education, so it is now very necessary to ask the Shanghai education community to pay attention to moral education issues. Why do we say that Shanghai schools today lack moral education? Look at the facts: Shanghai schools always expel a large number of students whenever vacations come around, which shows the helplessness of moral education. Usually students are left unattended or unquestioned, or another extreme method of moral education is used, namely physical punishment that endangers physical and mental health, and the results are all ineffective. Therefore, one can only wait until vacation time to expel a large number of students and declare their moral guidance ineffective. We certainly cannot say that all Shanghai schools are like this, but at least more than half of the schools are. As for organizations such as student self-government associations, most schools currently do not have them; even if they do, many are run by the school authorities. Spiritual training matters in schools (such as spiritual mobilization) are also rarely implemented effectively. We only need to read the Shanghai student community's telegram to the National Education Conference, which points out the shortcomings of Shanghai education, such as the lack of close teacher-student relationships and the widespread suppression and high-handedness of national salvation movements and extracurricular activities, to know how depressed the moral education in general schools is! Furthermore, general schools lack physical education; even schools with boarding facilities, in addition to providing food and berths, do not seem to have any good management, let alone actively cultivate group life training that promotes physical and mental health. The reasons why Shanghai school moral education has these shortcomings are certainly not just one, but in short, it is that after Shanghai's fall, the nature of private operation of education was strengthened, leading to many abnormal states. Currently, most schools exist through the form of private schools. The income of funds is sought to be increased as much as possible, and the expenditure is sought to be reduced as much as possible. As far as the use of school buildings is concerned, night schools are often run in addition to day schools, and in addition to self-use, they are also rented out. Therefore, apart from classes, there is no time or place to guide students. At the same time, the people running the schools cherish the existence of the school form too much, and are often excessively terrified of the environment, fearing to cause trouble, so they are unwilling for students to have any activities, and spare no effort to use all possible negative means to shift students' psychology, or even directly suppress students' activities. Some teachers also do not want to be responsible for moral education because they are threatened by the environment, and are unwilling to lead students to find a way out in thought and action. As for the students? They are currently very mobile. They are in School A this semester and in School B next semester, and they cannot establish a close relationship with the school after all. This is also a reason that makes moral education difficult to implement. In normal times, these shortcomings can be corrected by the government, but Shanghai at present has lost its axis and each goes its own way. The pace is extremely chaotic. However, the moral education in Shanghai schools should be quickly sound. Because 1. China is now beginning to vigorously carry out spiritual mobilization, and schools should be the core of its promotion. If there is no sound moral education in schools, spiritual mobilization will be difficult to implement. 2. The environment in Shanghai is gradually moving towards deterioration. Traitors and their masters are actively spreading all kinds of spiritual germs. Schools should extensively launch all kinds of ideological struggles, which is also an important task of the moral education department. 3. Schools that have lost their axis for a year and a half must contain many internal contradictions. If there is no sound moral education, these internal contradictions will inevitably turn into many troublesome problems. Therefore, Shanghai schools need to have sound moral education institutions at present for the sake of implementing national policies, for meeting the requirements of the times, and for enriching themselves. How to improve school moral education? In terms of system, attention should be paid to two points: First, in accordance with the resolutions of the moral education discussion meeting, the tutor system should be implemented effectively. Because only the tutor system can establish a close relationship between teachers and students, and can make teachers bear the responsibility of student life training in addition to imparting knowledge. Second, establish reasonable student organizations. Schools should not hate students, nor should they alienate students. Support student organizations and guide their reasonable group life. In terms of content, attention should also be paid to two points: First, the school's moral education should be coordinated with the National Spiritual Mobilization, and focusing on Shanghai's special environment, pay attention to training students in frugal living and eliminating all psychological factors of decadence and laziness. Second, pay attention to ideological training and vigorously carry out the spiritual anti-corruption movement. On the one hand, train students, and on the other hand, train teachers themselves. Teachers and students should be united and build the Great Wall of thought. In short, school moral education is not a slow issue. How Shanghai education can play the national mission, how to promote the anti-Japanese war and national construction movement, and achieve the goal of wartime education should start with moral education!

US President Cables to German and Italian Leaders - Appeals for World Peace - Asks Whether They Can Guarantee to Respect the Territorial Integrity of European Countries for Ten Years - (London) It has been learned that US President Roosevelt has launched extremely important negotiations with Germany and Italy, namely, sending cables to German Head of State Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, listing the places that each country has occupied in Europe in recent years, and asking whether they can provide guarantees that they are willing to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of European countries within ten years. If Germany and Italy accept this proposal, the United States will ask other countries to cooperate economically with Germany and Italy and help them obtain the necessary raw materials in exchange. The cable has been copied to the governments of the countries where they reside by the US ambassadors to the UK and France. President Roosevelt also hopes that all countries concerned will submit answers. (15th Havas dispatch)

(Washington) President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull last night sent cables to German Head of State Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, which read: "I believe that there are hundreds of millions of people in the world who are worried about the outbreak of a new war, or even the fear of the outbreak of several new wars. Your Excellency must have noticed this. The people of the United States are very concerned about this kind of fear and the possibility of a new war, and I am expressing it on their behalf. At the same time, all other nations in the Western Hemisphere also have a sense of unease. Everyone in the Americas knows that even if war breaks out in other continents, it can have a significant impact on the people of the Americas and the generations of countries in the world. The whole world has been living in an extremely tense environment for weeks, but the troops on all sides have not advanced, and at least for the time being, they can be considered at peace. In the name of the people of the United States, I cable Your Excellency, this is the time. In the past, I have applied to Your Excellency to use peaceful means to solve political, economic and social problems, and to avoid the use of force. As far as recent events are concerned, the threat of force seems to be seen again today. If this kind of threat is allowed to continue, the bankruptcy of a large part of the world is inevitable. If that is the case, all countries in the world, regardless of whether they are victorious, defeated or neutral, will suffer. If it is said that the whole world is bound to encounter this kind of fate, I really do not want to believe it, and I believe that the authorities of the major countries clearly have sufficient power to relieve the imminent disaster of their nations, and it is obvious that the nations of all countries also hope to relieve this kind of fear. However, contrary to recent events, in Europe, three countries have lost their independence, and in Africa, one country has lost its independence. In the Far East, a large area of land of an independent country is occupied by its neighbors, and according to rumors (we hope that these rumors are not true), there are still certain independent countries that have also suffered aggression. To put it bluntly, if international relations are not guided by more reasonable methods, the current situation will inevitably lead to disaster, and the time is not far away. Your Excellency has repeatedly stated that Your Excellency and the people of your country do not want to engage in war. If this is true, there will be no war. In addition, if a country does not fight to defend its territory, it is impossible to persuade the world that it has the right or need to make its people and the people of other countries suffer the pain of war. The reason why we Americans say this is not due to private thoughts, nor is it caused by fear and cowardice, but is driven by the mind of a politician and the love of mankind. I still firmly believe that all international problems can be solved at the conference table, but if one of the parties concerned wants to obtain a guarantee in advance that the results of the meeting will definitely be beneficial to that country before stopping the war, it will run counter to our call for peaceful discussion." (To be continued) (15th Havas dispatch)

President Roosevelt's Speech - Expresses Determination to Defend the New World - If the Independence and Sovereignty of Any Country in the Americas is Threatened, We Will Not Hesitate to Use Force to Deal with Each Other - (Washington) President Roosevelt said in a speech to the Pan American Union today that the tragedy of allowing the old world to become a new arena for old-day infighting to avoid encounters with the Americas relies on the Americas having a novel and powerful ideal that emerged at the time of independence, which is that a group of nations forms a Pan American group of nations to conduct open coordination and open meetings. Our meetings are not the result of war, but the result of our shared desire to obtain peace. There is no cause forcing the old world to move toward new disasters. Human beings are not subject to fate, but only to their own thoughts. Just a few days ago, a great power claimed that its country had become a prisoner of the Mediterranean. Not long after, the head of another country heard that one of its neighbors had agreed to defend the independence of another neighbor, and pointed out that this compromise was a threat, an encirclement. Any peaceful country is surrounded, threatened, and imprisoned by other powerful countries. There has never been such a thing in the world.

President Roosevelt then condemned the "dream of conquest" as chilling and sinful, saying that the American peace we celebrate today has no weakness in it. We are prepared to maintain and protect peace to the extreme of our strength. If any country attempts to subvert our system or damage the independence of any member of our group, then we are prepared to treat force with force. If the method of attack is economic oppression, I dare to guarantee my own country will also provide economic assistance, so that no country in the Americas needs to give up any bit of its sovereignty and freedom in order to maintain its economic welfare.

President Roosevelt continued that the American countries are now a family, and also have the right to ask the rest of the world to announce everything. The president said that we have a greater interest than merely defending the continent bounded by the sea. The economic affairs of the world are increasingly becoming a unit. In the future, any economic affairs cannot avoid disrupting economic life everywhere. The people of the next era will be concerned about how the new world and the old world coexist. We have the right to declare that there must not be a group of world affairs that does not allow us to have a choice, but only allows us to turn our country into a military camp. This must be because we are a vassal of a victorious empire before we can be driven by this. In the hemisphere where we live, the most genuine way to defend peace must always be tied to a kind of hope, that is, that overseas sister countries break the shackles of the old doctrine that prevents them from tending toward permanent happiness. We also have a goal in world affairs. Our desire for peace is as strong as our desire for mutual defense, and we can recruit greater loyalty, dedication, discipline, and have a say in determining the order of world affairs than those who seek temporary victory or equally ineffective glory elsewhere. This is the vivid document of the new world to the old world.

President Roosevelt continued that he still believed that the republics of the New World could save the Old World from the disaster that was already upon them. When President Roosevelt mentioned the "encirclement" protests made by the Allied Powers, he recalled his guarantee to Canada last year that if the dominion was attacked from overseas, the United States would join in the common defense. Later, at the Lima Conference, a declaration was jointly issued by twenty-one Latin American countries, stating that they would work together to protect the integrity of their countries to resist any direct or indirect attack, but the American countries did not recognize any of these responsibilities. Any kind of thing in the country becomes a prisoner, surrounds any American country, or becomes any kind of threat. Therefore, adopting this kind of plan in this hemisphere can be regarded as a guarantee not for war, but for peace, because all American countries have no aggressive intentions or ambitions to establish hegemony. If this kind of method can be effective here, then it can also be effective elsewhere. Is it too extravagant to hope for this? President Roosevelt continued, "Do we really think that countries have no other way to realize their destiny except to use the methods used by the Huns and Vandals 1,500 years ago? The question at hand is whether our civilization will be involved in the terrible vortex of endless militarism, or whether we can maintain the ideal of the peaceful personality civilization as a structure of our life."

President Roosevelt's Remarks - Different Interpretations - Implies that the Japanese Empire Has No Power to Conquer Asia - (Washington) President Roosevelt said yesterday that "any nation, at any time, has the power to seek freedom," which has made the debate in Congress on the Neutrality Act and foreign policy more intense. Isolationist Senator Reno said that the President's words intended to "participate" in the internal affairs of other countries, inducing some people to rise up and rebel against their government. The President's words were tantamount to telling Japan that although Japan conquered Asia, it had no power to build its empire in East Asia. According to another isolationist Senator Thomas, the President's words were completely "a manifestation of the psychology of the war of terror. However, from my observation, this terror is completely unfounded. The winds and clouds in Europe have their complex reasons, but it is alarmist to say that a world war will follow." According to Renault's words to reporters, he will submit a new resolution in Congress to clarify the position of the New Monroe Doctrine as the basis of American foreign policy. In other words, he will clearly announce to the countries of Europe and Asia in this resolution that the sole interest of the United States is entirely in the Western Hemisphere. Republican Representative Li, who is also an isolationist, said that he fully agrees with what President Roosevelt said, "If any country attacks the Western Hemisphere at any time, we will rise up to defend ourselves, but it is wrong to force our ideals and political system on others." It is reported that the President said yesterday at the Pan American Union Council that if someone invades the Western Hemisphere, the United States must do its best to help all countries, but

New Teas from Various Regions Come on the Market, Concentrated for Export to Hong Kong, Under the Control of the Leave Committee and Purchased by Fu Hua, New Tea Areas Opened in the Southwest, Factories Established for Improvement, Banks Offer Loans to Support Development
　　New teas from various regions have already begun to come onto the market, and are being purchased uniformly by Fu Hua Company for concentrated export to Hong Kong. The China Tea Company has opened new tea areas in the southwest, establishing tea factories in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi to produce tea. Various banks are providing loans as much as possible to support the development of Chinese tea. Details are recorded as follows:

　　First Batch of Teas from Various Regions on the Market

　　Tea leaf harvesting and production are divided into first, second, third, and fourth batches, as well as autumn tea. (1) The first batch of tea, also known as the first spring tea, is harvested and produced around ten days before Grain Rain. (2) The second batch of tea, also known as the second spring tea, is harvested and produced around ten days after Grain Rain. (3) The third batch of tea, also known as "zi" tea, is harvested and produced around the Beginning of Summer. (4) The fourth batch of tea is harvested and produced around the Grain Full. The first two batches mentioned above are called spring tea, and the latter two batches are summer tea. (5) Autumn tea is harvested and produced during the Beginning of Autumn and White Dew seasons, and is called White Dew Tea. Currently, in provinces such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian, the first batch of tea has already come onto the market.

　　Fu Hua Purchases for Export to Hong Kong

　　After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance took control of tea sales, it designated the affiliated Fu Hua Company to purchase tea in various producing areas, transport it to Hong Kong for export, and stipulated new tea transportation routes. At the same time, it entered into trade contracts with the Soviet Union and other countries, making every effort to promote sales abroad in order to replenish foreign exchange reserves and maintain the compensation for China's trade deficit. Tea exports after the war have increased compared to before the war. For example, in the 26th year [of the Republic, 1937], it was 406,572 quintals, valued at 30,787,274 yuan in national currency, and in the 27th year [of the Republic, 1938], it was 416,246 quintals, valued at 33,054,085 yuan in national currency.

　　Opening New Tea Areas and Establishing Factories for Improvement

　　The China Tea Company, recognizing that tea is one of China's special products and occupies an important position in foreign trade, consistently ranks in the top four or five in terms of national export value, with an annual export value of over 30 million yuan. General Manager Shou Jingwei has agreed with various provincial governments to open new tea areas in various southwestern provinces, and to establish tea factories in Sichuan, Yunnan, Xikang, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces to improve and refine tea production for overseas sales. The company recently held a special board meeting in Hong Kong, which approved the outline of the national tea production and sales plan for the 28th year [of the Republic, 1939].

　　Tea Market Shifts from Shanghai to Hong Kong

　　This year's new teas from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and other places have already come onto the market, specifically the "Mingqian" teas, which are harvested and produced before the Qingming Festival. The Trade Commission stipulates that tea exports must settle and sell foreign exchange according to law. Tea merchants and shops are allowed to transport tea to Shanghai for domestic sales, while foreign tea merchants are absolutely prohibited from transporting tea to Shanghai, except for raw tea. However, the transportation of raw tea to Shanghai must also be approved in advance. Therefore, members of the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association, who operate foreign tea businesses in Shanghai, have all established offices in producing areas and Hong Kong. Foreign firms dealing in tea have also started purchasing in Hong Kong, and the tea market in Shanghai has shifted to Hong Kong.

　　Banks Offer Loans to Support Development

　　Various banks have been ordered to allocate large sums of money to provide loans to tea farmers and tea merchants in order to support the development of Chinese tea. The China Farmers Bank, the Communications Bank, and other banks have cooperated with provincial banks and local banks, with a tentatively set total loan amount of 20 million yuan in national currency. At the same time, various tea firms will continue to provide loans to tea farmers in Zhejiang and Anhui provinces according to past practices, but the total amount has been reduced to 1 million yuan in national currency. Therefore, it is expected that this year's tea production will be considerable.

Accountant Xi Yushu Formulates Methods for War Accounting Final Settlement; War Losses Treated as Deferred Assets to Be Amortized and Offset by Annual Profits, Approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

　　Xi Yushu, the chief accountant of the Gongxin Accounting Firm in this city, has been practicing his profession and serving industry and commerce for more than ten years. In view of the enormous losses suffered by various industries and businesses since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, significant difficulties arose when various industries conducted their final settlements at the end of last year. Accountant Xi, having received inquiries from various sectors, formulated four separate methods based on the different war loss situations of various enterprises, and submitted them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs with detailed justifications on November 30th of the 27th year [of the Republic, 1938]. This proposal was supported by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which appealed to the Ministry. The aforementioned discussion has been published in various newspapers. The aforementioned methods have now been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The original approval is as follows:

　　Approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Commercial Character No. 25095: The original submitter, Accountant Xi Yushu, submitted a document on November 30th of the 27th year [of the Republic, 1938], requesting the promulgation of rules for the handling of war losses by various industries and businesses, requesting consideration and approval. The documents submitted have been reviewed. After consulting with the Ministry of Finance on March 1st of the 28th year [of the Republic, 1939], Consultation No. 3428, regarding the original proposal to treat war losses as deferred assets to be amortized and offset by annual profits, it was stated that:

　　In consideration of the hardships faced by businesses and to maintain the foundation of various industries, approval may be granted. As for the amortization method, the asset valuation methods attached to the collection guidelines for the first category of profit-seeking enterprise income tax stipulate considerable restrictions. For example, the depreciation of goodwill is calculated based on a ten-year standard, and the amortization of start-up expenses cannot exceed 20% of the original amount each year. The amortization of war losses should follow the rules for goodwill, with a minimum amortization period of ten years, etc. The procedures in the original submission regarding whether companies and stores should continue to operate after asset damage, and decisions to increase or decrease capital, are adequately stipulated in commercial laws and regulations and do not require separate rules. This approval is for your information. This approval is dated April 5th of the 28th year [of the Republic, 1939], Minister Weng Wenhao. It is reported that after receiving the approval, the accounting firm feared that various enterprises in this city might not fully understand the accounting treatment methods and planned to provide further explanations in the fifth issue of the firm's Gongxin Accounting Monthly. The address of the firm is on the first floor, No. 505 Henan Road.

　　The Ministry of Economic Affairs consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the method of verifying the purchase and transportation of goods to Shanghai by manufacturers from friendly countries. It stated that the Ministry had consulted with relevant agencies and agreed on measures for reviewing the transport of prohibited goods to Shanghai and for purchasing and providing relief. A telegram has been sent to the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan for review, and the meeting minutes have been sent to your Ministry for reference. Subsequently, a telegram from the office of Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission stated that the agreed measures for reviewing the transport of prohibited goods were appropriate and should be implemented. The Executive Yuan also issued Directive No. 2112 from the character "Lv" on March 3rd of the 28th year [of the Republic, 1939], stating that the proposal was approved at the 403rd meeting of the Executive Yuan. However, the re-export of bamboo, wood, paper, charcoal, tea, and egg products to Shanghai should be exempted from prohibition. These instructions must be followed.

　　Therefore, the Ministry should comply with these instructions. The original method of reviewing the transport of prohibited goods to Shanghai has been revised by the Ministry, adding Article 9, which states: "These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation," and the title of the original measures has been changed to "Measures for Reviewing the Transport of Prohibited Goods to Shanghai." The amended measures were promulgated by ministerial order on March 13th. Regarding the resolution of the Executive Yuan that the re-export of bamboo, wood, paper, charcoal, tea, and egg products to Shanghai should be exempted from prohibition, the Ministry has also announced this. Subsequently, when manufacturers from friendly countries within the Shanghai Settlement purchase various prohibited goods for transport to Shanghai, they should be handled in accordance with the "Measures for Reviewing the Transport of Prohibited Goods to Shanghai." The provisional guarantee release methods previously determined by the Ministry should be abolished. The exception is that the certificates for the transport of prohibited goods to Shanghai verified and forwarded by agencies such as the National Agricultural and Food Corporation are based on the principle of local review, and the detailed methods will be communicated separately after consultation and formulation by the relevant agencies. The Ministry hereby consults with your Ministry for reference and notification.

Case of Chen Tingsheng Killed Due to Adultery and Jealousy; One Main Culprit Arrested; Wang Xinda, Suspected of Involvement, Released After Arrest

　　Wang Xinda, a hoodlum from the Faxiangzhen area of Husi, residing at No. 27 Haigeli, Haige Road, in the western district of the French Concession, was arrested by detectives from the French Concession Police at midnight on the 12th and taken to the General Police Station for investigation. This information was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Wang's arrest was due to suspicions of involvement in the case where his sister, Wang Guizhen, colluded with her lover, Tao Boqing, and paid someone to murder her former lover, Chen Tingsheng (also known as Chen Sanzi, a former hoodlum from Mali). After a detailed investigation by the Criminal Police, Wang was released home at midnight on the 14th because he was not suspected of any wrongdoing. After Wang's arrest, his family made every effort to rescue him. After Wang was released, his family was overjoyed and unanimously pointed out that his sister, Wang Guizhen, was causing trouble. It is reported that the French Concession Police are paying close attention to the Chen Tingsheng murder case. While investigating and apprehending the fugitive murderer, they arrested the main culprit the night before last in a large hotel in the International Settlement. The suspect was taken back to the French Concession Police Station, where he confessed that the handgun used to kill Chen was hidden in the kitchen shed of Song Akun (nicknamed Song Zhengshen, a hoodlum from Xujiahui), who resided at No. 966 Xujiahui Town Entrance, Bedan Road, inside the Hongfei Bicycle Shop. According to the confession, the detectives rushed to the address, arrested Song, and seized the handgun, bringing both back to the Police Station for investigation. It is expected that the arrested suspects will be brought to the Second Special District Court for interrogation around Monday. The Second Special District Court has scheduled a continued hearing of the Chen case for the 28th.

　　According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, this morning (the 15th), detectives from the French Concession, wearing steel mesh vests, suddenly went to a hotel on Avenue Edward VII and arrested four members of an assassination and robbery gang, seizing two handguns loaded with ammunition. One of the guns was involved in an assassination case, and the other was used in at least five robbery cases. Details are as follows: French Concession detectives cooperated with the Shanghai Municipal Police Department in a continuous search throughout the night, arresting eleven men and two women related to the murder case at No. 39 Haigeli, Haige Road, on March 20th. The victim was Chen Tingsheng, 36, owner of a cardboard shop on Seymour Road. The incident was caused by a love triangle. The search team began operations at 8:00 PM yesterday (the 14th), went to the Datong Hotel, broke into a room with guns, arrested five Chinese men inside, and took them to the police station for questioning. Later, at midnight, they went to a hotel on Zhejiang Road and arrested two men and women. After obtaining further information, they conducted a final search at a hotel on Avenue Edward VII at 3:00 AM, acting swiftly so that the four Chinese men in the hotel could not escape before being arrested, and seized two handguns involved in assassination and robbery cases. After Chen was assassinated, French Concession detectives immediately arrested Chen's wife, who, along with her lover, was clearly the mastermind behind the murder. It was later learned that the four murderers were members of a large-scale gangster group. Chen's wife had given 100 yuan to a relative to pass on to the gangsters, and promised to give an additional 300 yuan, but the gangsters did not receive the money because Chen's wife had already been arrested.

While passing in front of the Lianhua Film Company on Nanhui Street, Yao Jinxiang, a 49-year-old local rogue living next door at No. 16, suddenly stopped them, demanding a toll. When they refused, he gathered more than 20 accomplices and beat Zhu and the others, causing injuries. After reporting to the French Concession Police, Yao was arrested and brought before the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court yesterday. The plaintiff requested a postponement to arrest the fugitive accomplices for investigation and prosecution, charging the defendant with attempted extortion and assault. Judge Liao interrogated the defendant and ordered a postponement for further investigation. The defendant was detained.

Diamond Earrings Robbed; One Perpetrator Apprehended

　　Weng Xie, the 60-year-old wife of Weng Jinshan, owner of the Tianyu Pawnshop at No. 176 Wangzhi Road, Chaozhou native, was robbed of a pair of diamond earrings worth 1,000 yuan while riding in a rickshaw to a relative's house at 3:00 PM on the 9th of this month. The incident occurred in front of No. 189, south of Laoxianfu Road, Caishi Road. She fainted from shock at the time and fell out of the rickshaw, injuring both feet. She immediately reported the incident to the French Concession Police, requesting an investigation. On the 11th, detectives arrested Wang Baosheng (35), also known as Wang Guilin, a Tongzhou native and member of the gang, near the Xiaocaichang in Taiping Bridge. He was brought to the Police Station. It was discovered that he was a repeat offender and had been arrested and sentenced to three months for a robbery case in January last year. He confessed that Chen A'er, a fugitive accomplice, committed the robbery and pawned the earrings at the Yongheng Pawnshop on Shanxi Road. Detectives went to the pawnshop to investigate and retrieved the original stolen goods, which had been pawned for 200 yuan that day. On the day of Wang's arrest, he added another 200 yuan to the pawn. The Police Station sent Wang to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday, Judge Liao presided over the preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Division. The Police Station lawyer filed charges according to the law. The plaintiff, Weng Xie, testified about the circumstances of the robbery. Wang confessed that Chen committed the robbery and he pawned the earrings. He lied to me, saying he pawned them for 20 yuan and gave me 10 yuan. Chen has now fled to Pudong, etc. After verifying the confession, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing on the 20th. The defendant was returned to custody.

Gambling with Poker; Boss Sentenced to Six Months, Gamblers Fined Separately

　　The Laozha Police Station, due to its location in the central district and the abundance of hotels, inevitably has undesirable elements hiding among them, committing crimes. Therefore, a policy of large-scale roundups is implemented from time to time. At 10:30 PM the night before last, Chief Inspector Bo Bolin, Detective Chief Bo Latt, Chinese Detective Wang Shanqing, Detectives Zhang Bingchun, Qiu Sijiu, Zhou Wenqing, and others led a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in a search of the Xinxin Hotel on Guizhou Road. At the time, a poker game was in progress in room 414 of the hotel.

Woman Instigated to File for Divorce; Falsely Accuses Fiancé Gu Zhenghong of Theft; Gu Testifies with Vehemence, Expressing Boundless Pain; Court Declares Mediation Unsuccessful

　　Gu Zhenghong, a throat specialist and national medicine practitioner from Wuxing, Zhejiang, residing at No. 21 Songjianong, Beijing Road, currently practicing under a signboard at Tianshengtang National Medicine Store at No. 64-66 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, 23 years old this year, previously treated a throat ailment for Yin Rongqiu, a woman from Hubei currently residing at No. 3471 Yinghuali, Route Robert, Husi (24 years old this year). The two sides interacted frequently, and consequently, feelings developed. Gu further proposed marriage to the woman, who was a Muslim and had received a high level of education. Gu, deeply in love, agreed to join Islam and support the woman's parents. From then on, the two sides were in harmony, and on March 3rd of last year, they became engaged at the Ruizhong Hotel on Jiujiang Road. The two sides associated closely. Unexpectedly, the woman suddenly regretted it and requested to terminate the engagement, citing Gu's bad behavior. Gu firmly opposed it, but a resolution was not reached. The feelings between the two sides became irreconcilable. Recently, Yin Rongqiu, represented by a lawyer, filed a request with the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Gu Zhenghong for mediation to terminate the engagement. Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned the two parties for mediation yesterday morning in the Fourth Civil Division, presided over by Judge Sun Penghan. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the petitioner stated that the opposing party had engaged in various bad behaviors after the engagement, so she was unwilling to grow old with him and requested to terminate the engagement. The opposing party stated that he opposed the termination of the engagement, that the petitioner's request was completely unreasonable, and that it was entirely due to the instigation of her uncle. On March 30th, at the instigation of her uncle, she falsely accused me of stealing her gold ring to the police station.

　　and I was beaten and waterboarded, causing great damage to my body. Later, the First Special District Court found that there was no evidence of my guilt and ordered my release. During his testimony, Gu spoke with vehemence, as if he had boundless pain hidden in his chest and unable to express it. After reviewing the testimony, the court declared the mediation unsuccessful and instructed the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit.

He was reported to the police and sent to the hospital for treatment. Upon examination, it was determined that he had taken poison in a large quantity, and he had lost consciousness.

Selling Opium is Punishable;

　　Chinese Detective Ye Yuxi and Detective Liu Zhaonian of the Public Concession's Narcotics Department learned that someone was privately setting up an opium selling operation at No. 705 Hankou Road. They requested a search warrant from the First Special District Court and rushed to search the premises the day before yesterday. They arrested Lu Changfa, a Tianjin native, and his wife Lu Zhang, and confiscated 63 taels of opium, 27 taels of opium dross, more than 340 yuan in cash, and seals. According to Lu Changfa's confession, the opium was supplied by a Zhou Mujing, who lived in room 458 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. The detectives went to arrest him, but he had already fled. The couple Lu were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process and filed charges based on Article 5 of the Anti-Smoking Regulations for selling opium. Under questioning, Lu Changfa confessed that he was forced by life to engage in this business to seek forgiveness. After the court appointed lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang as pro bono counsel for the two defendants, Judge Xiao Xiefen announced the verdict in court, sentencing Lu Changfa to three years in prison and depriving him of public rights for three years. Lu Zhang was acquitted and released. The confiscated opium and other items were confiscated according to the list.

Gunshots Suddenly Heard on Jiangxi Road Bridge

　　At around 4:00 PM yesterday, a gunshot was suddenly heard near the Jiangxi Road Bridge. At that time, pedestrians on the bridge, unaware of the truth, were horrified and thought that another unfortunate incident had occurred, so they rushed to avoid it. It was later learned that the gunshot was fired by a Japanese officer of the Water Police Station while inspecting ships in the Suzhou River at that location, because someone was

Children's Weekly The Spring Break is Over Chen Liang

The spring break is over. Children, did you have a happy time during this holiday? This was originally a longer period of rest, and it can be said that you have been studying too hard, allowing your body and mind to adjust. Playing is not a bad thing, but it needs to have a limit. Even during class, you should concentrate fully on the books and listen quietly to the teacher's explanations, without mixing in any ambition to play. Once break time arrives, leave the classroom, and aside from self-study and homework that must be done, you can play freely and happily. Rest after fatigue is enough to cultivate more vigorous spirit, enough to improve the efficiency of work and study, which even health experts do not deny.

Modern schools are not like the old-fashioned private schools of the past. Even if children have not seen them with their own eyes (there are still some in rural inland areas), you may have heard of them. The teacher would wear a stern face all day long, sit upright, and if a student could not recite the text or slightly disobeyed, they would be beaten and scolded, even punished by kneeling on incense. The surroundings were filled with a dull and fearful atmosphere. The teacher used a "interventionist" approach to teach students, with no Sundays or spring breaks. If there was any break, it was only for "busy work," such as harvesting wheat and transplanting rice in the summer, or harvesting rice and planting wheat in the autumn. Although temporarily free from the teacher's confinement, they had to be sent to work in the fields by adults. Where was there any time to play!

Now, aren't the schools in the cities much more free and pleasant! Teachers lead students in games, teach them to sing, and there are also books and handicrafts, doing all sorts of things that children like. There are interesting activities, and there's no beating or scolding, because this is the "automatism" education method. The so-called "automatism" is to allow children to be inspired by teachers and automatically absorb knowledge from various textbooks. While both are studying, the students in rural private schools suffer much more, and the children in urban schools are much more at ease.

However, in a relaxed and un-interfered environment, children should be even more diligent in their studies, not neglecting their education, and not thinking about playing games during class. The spring break is over, and you have played enough. In these extraordinary times, it is not easy for parents to earn money to pay tuition. You are all future masters of the country. You certainly love your parents and your country, so you should seek knowledge in a timely manner, increase your intelligence, and become good children and good citizens. Only then will you live up to the hopes of your parents and the hopes of the country.

Who Can Calculate? Yin

On Sunday, Ziqiang and Ziwei did not go to school. After finishing their homework at home, their father came over and said to them, "Today I read a newspaper and saw a statement issued by the Ministry of Finance." He was about to continue when Ziqiang interrupted, "Isn't it about Britain agreeing to lend us money?" Father shook his head and said, "No! This is a debt statistic. Since the war of resistance, China's newly added public debt is about 150 billion yuan. Together with the previous national debt, it totals 600 billion yuan. Now, can any of you figure out how much national debt our country had before the war of resistance, and what fraction of the previous amount does the post-war national debt account for?"

Ziqiang and Ziwei both replied in unison, "I can calculate it, I can calculate it!" Then, each took a pencil and paper, muttering in their mouths as they calculated. Father watched with a smile on the side. After a while, Ziqiang raised his hand and shouted loudly, "I figured it out! Isn't the total amount of national debt before and after the war 600 billion yuan? Subtracting the 150 billion yuan after the war leaves the pre-war national debt. After calculating the pre-war national debt, and using a common divisor to simplify, I know that 150 billion is one-third of 450 billion. Therefore, I have calculated that our country's pre-war national debt was 450 billion yuan, and the post-war national debt is only one-third of the pre-war debt."

Father nodded repeatedly, praising Ziqiang's intelligence. Ziwei was a little unhappy because he calculated slower and was taken advantage of by his older brother, and he lowered his head silently. Father then said, "Then, if this 600 billion yuan of national debt is calculated based on China's population of 450 million, how much money should each person bear? Let's see who can calculate it and who can calculate it fast!" So Ziqiang and Ziwei each started calculating on paper again.

"Father!" Ziwei shouted after calculating for a while, "Each person bears a little more than thirteen yuan, right? The remainder below cannot be completely divided." Father smiled and said, "Exactly right. I let you both calculate twice, and each of you won once. Now, you can rest. Next time, how about I give you the national debt of Japan to calculate?"

After Ziqiang and Ziwei both answered "Okay," they went out for a walk hand in hand.

Wireless Telephoto Machine Su Ling

Children! Since the invention of radio, we have felt so happy! Sitting at home, we can hear all kinds of pleasant music, speeches by famous people, and reports on current affairs.

Recently, Western scientists have invented another even more amazing thing, which is the wireless telephoto machine that I am now going to introduce to you. The wireless telephoto machine can use electrical current to broadcast a human body, image, or landscape through a wire, and then receive and display it on a small screen at the other end. At first, many scientists experimented for a long time and failed, and everyone thought it was a dream that could never be realized. But in 1926, a British scientist named Baird finally succeeded. His first public performance was very successful. Later, after continued research by many scientists, by mid-December of last year, it had progressed to the point where it could be viewed from 3,000 miles away.

After the invention of the wireless telephoto machine, you can watch boat races, boxing matches, and tennis matches at home, as if you were there. Soon there will be many wireless telephoto stations, just like the current wireless broadcasting stations. Therefore, with this wireless telephoto machine, you can see everything without leaving home.

Children, you must be very happy to hear this news, and you must be very eager to see this telephoto machine! However, because this telephoto machine has only recently been invented, it is not easy to become widespread for a while, and the selling price is also very high. Each one currently sells for about 150 pounds, which is equivalent to seven or eight thousand yuan in national currency. But we will eventually be able to see it sooner or later.

Recent News Animal's Childishness Yong

Jue'er is a child who loves animals, so his family raised many chickens, geese, a snow-white little goat, and also cats, birds, dogs, and goldfish for him! After returning home from school, he often plays with them. Whenever he is free on Saturdays and Sundays, he catches small animals in the garden, hides them in bottles or boxes, and pays attention to their food every day.

For convenience, he named the dog Happiness, and called the cat Ahei because it was covered in oily black fur. But Happiness was really hateful and often bullied its companions, especially Ahei was its target. Jue'er had punished it several times, but the naughty Happiness, like children, forgets easily. It is not afraid of punishment. Jue'er really had no better way to protect Ahei, so he locked it in an empty room, taking things to feed it every day. In the beginning, Ahei lived a peaceful life quietly. Perhaps a few days of confinement made Ahei extremely bored. Coincidentally, Jue'er forgot to close the window. The bright sunshine outside tempted it to jump out of the window. How comfortable and free it was! Standing next to the flower bushes, it stared in fascination at the dancing butterflies. But Happiness suddenly darted out. It didn't have time to dodge and succumbed to its sharp claws, just meowing urgently! At this time, Jue'er was preparing tomorrow's homework in the study. Hearing the cry, he knew that Ahei had been wronged again. He rushed out in a panic and drove Happiness away, but drops of fresh blood flowed from Ahei's left leg, and it couldn't walk. Jue'er was very distressed and put medicine on it, and specially set up a soft nest. Under Jue'er's care, Ahei recovered its health in twenty days. How happy it was!

One night, Jue'er was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awakened by a huge noise. He was very scared because it was very dark all around, but the sound seemed very special, mixed with a familiar cry for help. Wasn't that Ahei's pitiful cry? When this thought suddenly went through his mind, he ran out with a flashlight, regardless of everything. Happiness saw its little master and knew it was going to be beaten again, so it ran away without a trace. At this time, Ahei was covered in wounds and was dying. Jue'er cried sadly. After he went to bed, he couldn't continue his dream, just thinking, "Ahei finally died under the violence of Happiness because of cowardice and non-resistance." On the next clear morning, Jue'er buried this pitiful and lovable little cat, covering it with red flowers and green grass.

Several Birds That Can't Fly Shunji

1. Ostrich The ostrich's home is in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula of Asia, not in the beautiful mountains and rivers of the two continents, but near the deserts of these two continents. It originally had four feet, and walked almost like a normal animal. Because it liked to jump, its two front feet became small. Later, it didn't use its front feet to walk, so they gradually degenerated until now, leaving only two strangely long feet.

2. Dodo Bird Also known as the large spotted bird, it was produced on Mauritius Island in eastern Africa. Unfortunately, it is now extinct.

3. Moa Produced in southeastern Australia, on New Zealand Island, it not only cannot fly, but it doesn't even have traces of wings on its body. It is now extinct.

4. Kiwi Produced on New Zealand Island in Australia, it has no wings, but it has very thick legs and very large feet. Each foot has four toes, and three of the toes have extremely sharp claws, which can grab and step with great force. It is very brave, and its height is only about three feet.

5. Penguin Produced on the coast of the frigid zone, and in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, it is also known as seabird. It can use its wings to paddle in the water, likes to live in groups, and its nest is on the seashore. Its food is sea shrimp and fish in the sea.

6. Hoatzin Produced in South America, it likes to live in trees near the water. It originally could fly, but later, because it didn't fly often, it can only flap its wings to climb onto tree branches. If it goes on for a few more years, I am afraid that it won't even be able to flap.

7. Cassowary There is a kind of ostrich in Australia called cassowary, which is different from the real ostrich. Its head is covered with a horny cover, and on both sides of its face, there are red fleshy skins hanging down. Therefore, some people call it the crowned ostrich, or horned ostrich. There is also a kind of emu in Australia, which is a close relative of the cassowary. The difference between it and the cassowary is that its head does not have a horny cap and hanging fleshy skin, but short hair. It can be six feet tall.

8. Aepyornis Produced in eastern Africa, it has now been eaten to extinction.

Make a Little Radio Amateur (7) Xi Ren

4. Install Antenna and Ground Wire

The next morning, before dawn, the clock downstairs had just struck six times, and Wang Min woke up. Listening to him tossing and turning, he couldn't fall asleep no matter what. He finally dragged himself to seven-thirty, and he couldn't sleep any longer, so he got dressed and got up. He quietly climbed out of bed, and carelessly bumped a chair next to the bed, making a sound that woke up his cousin on the opposite bed.

The two brothers got up one after another, washed their faces together, and walked towards the garden. After talking for a while, their mother came to call them for breakfast.

After eating breakfast, Wang Min dragged his cousin towards the market outside. Last night, his cousin told Wang Min that to make a crystal radio, he first had to install an antenna and a ground wire, and the antenna and ground wire had to be bought from a radio store. Wang Min asked his mother for a dollar before dragging his cousin outside to buy them.

"Brother, how long should I buy the antenna?" He thought of this question when he was halfway there.

"Normally, just buy sixty feet."

"Then how about the ground wire?" Wang Min asked.

"Just buy ten feet of rubber wire for the ground wire, because we live in a bungalow, and the tap water pipe is right outside the back window. If you live on the second floor, or are far away from the tap water pipe, then you have to buy a little more. Of course, if you live on the third floor, you have to buy even more."

"Brother, what is rubber wire?"

"Rubber wire? Rubber wire is what is commonly used for electric lights. But there are two kinds of wires used for electric lights. Rubber wire is one of them, and the other is called flower wire."

"Why is it called rubber wire?"

"That's because it has a layer of rubber on the outside." His cousin thought for a while, and suddenly remembered something, and quickly continued, "Oh, I forgot, you have to buy ten more feet of rubber wire?"

"What for?"

"I ask you, if you only buy the antenna and don't buy the wire to bring it in, then what is the use of the antenna?" His cousin didn't explain to Wang Min, but asked him back like this.

"Then what should I do?"

"These ten feet of antenna are for the lead-in wire."

"Oh..." Wang Min understood.

The two brothers walked along laughing and talking. Before long, they had arrived at the door of a radio store. Wang Min and his cousin ran in and bought sixty feet (note) of antenna wire and twenty feet of rubber wire, and also bought two white porcelain insulators. His cousin picked up the two insulators and said to Wang Min, "Look, these are called insulators."

Wang Min picked up the insulator and looked at it carefully. The clerk had already settled the bill, and the two brothers took the things and walked out.

Back home, his cousin took out the things he had bought and put them aside, and went to find a ladder to climb up to the roof to install the antenna.

(Note) Feet is feet.

Children's Small Garden Spring

Lequn Elementary School Sixth Grade Student Li Hongyi

Hoping, hoping, the east wind is coming, and the footsteps of spring are getting closer. Everything looks like it has just woken up, and is happily opening its eyes. The mountains are becoming brighter, the water is rising, and the sun's face is turning red.

Tender, green, in the garden, in the fields, a large expanse, a large expanse, is full of peach trees, apricot trees, and willow trees, all covered with flowers. Red like fire, pink like rosy clouds, white like snow. Thousands of bees buzz among the flowers, and butterflies, big and small, fly back and forth.

However, in this year's spring, there is no warmth, no warmth; no vitality, no love. All there is, is coldness, sorrow, and barrenness, just like the harsh winter.

Spring is also a season for travel. On the vast plains, there are famous scenic spots. These are all enough to linger and be intoxicated by, but in this year's spring, there is no longer any chance to snuggle in the embrace of nature.

It's spring! But this year's spring has no sun!

Clock Sound Xinsheng Elementary School Fifth Grade Student Ning Rongshu

The east revealed the sun, and I was awakened by the clock on the wall. Looking up at it, it was already six o'clock. Ticking constantly, vaguely, it seemed to be saying to people, "You should struggle! You should work hard! You should strive for survival and freedom! Lovable elementary school students! Are you still not aware? You should listen to my words, don't be lazy, don't be afraid of hardship, work hard to study, follow my leadership, and walk towards the bright road! Children! Get up! Listen to the dong dong of the clock, it has struck seven times! It's getting late! Get up!" I seemed to have heard this advice too, so I quickly got up and went to school. When I arrived at school, I still vaguely heard the sound of the clock.

Qiantang Tide Jindé Elementary School Fifth Grade Student Xu Depei

The Qiantang Tide is the only scenery in my hometown (Haining County, Zhejiang Province). The best place to watch the tide is near Babao.

Looking out from the Shanghai embankment, the vast expanse is a boundless ocean. When the tide has not yet come, the water is calm, and the gentle breeze caresses the face, making it extremely comfortable. When the tide first comes, it looks like a wisp of white thread from a distance. The closer it gets, the wider it becomes. In the blink of an eye, it has reached the front. The crest of the tide rises several feet high. After the white thread passes, there are huge waves surging, galloping, and surging, which is extremely majestic. In the event of a large tide, the tide water rushes over the embankment, and if anyone does not escape in time, their life will be in danger. The crest of the tide reaches as far as the Zhakou in Hangzhou.

What a pity! Now it has become a dark world. I wonder when I can see it again for the second time?

Black Cat and Calico Cat Zhendong Elementary School Third Grade Student Zhang Zude

I have two cats at home, one is calico, and one is black. Last night, I saw the calico cat and the black cat meowing under the table, so I took a bowl of rice and gave it to them to eat.

My younger brother came over, saw it, and said, "The calico cat's color is good-looking, and the black cat's color is not good-looking, give the calico cat more to eat!" I thought this was unfair, so I asked my younger brother: Why should you give the calico cat more to eat?

My younger brother said: "Because the calico cat is good-looking, and the black cat is not good-looking." But I thought that the black cat can catch mice, and the calico cat cannot catch mice, so I should give the black cat more to eat. I asked my younger brother, "Don't follow the changes of the times and have the same knowledge as others. You must know that just being good-looking on the outside, but having no ability at all, what's the use of that?"

Children's Free Drawing Zhou Ying's Snow White

(14) Tian Sun

Snow White is really in extreme danger. How can such a naive and innocent girl escape from the clutches of the sinister and vicious Queen while being with her! The Queen's disguise is especially ingenious and very perfect, so that Snow White never suspected her at all, and only thought she was a poor old woman selling groceries.

After Snow White helped the Queen to sit down on a most comfortable chair, she hurried to make tea for her to drink. As soon as she turned around, the Queen immediately took out the poisoned apple from under her shawl, wiped it on her sleeve for a while, wiping it until it was red and shiny, and very beautiful. When Snow White came back after making the tea, the Queen beckoned and called the Princess closer to her, looked at the apple in her hand, widened her eyes, made a very mysterious look, and said in a low voice, "Dear, this is not an ordinary apple, it is really very precious. Let me tell you a secret, this apple can fulfill your wishes. If you tell it what you wish, it will make your wish come true, it is really extraordinarily effective!"

Snow White said very happily, "Oh, so it's a wish-fulfilling good apple!" She had originally heard of this kind of apple, which is a rare and very precious magical object. At that time, she remembered that she had once told her wish in the wishing well, and it had come true later. At this moment, if she took a bite of this apple, perhaps it would allow her to see the young and handsome prince again. This was originally the greatest wish in her heart.

How clever the hateful Queen was, she could see what Snow White was thinking in her heart on her face. So she stepped up her efforts and didn't want to waste a minute of time. Immediately, she said with a glib tongue, "Miss, you are a loyal and gentle good girl, I will allow you to bite into this fairy fruit, without costing anything. Dear, you just need to think carefully! Just bite this apple, and you can have whatever you want. Do you want a beautiful dress? Do you want some decorative pearls and jewels? Come, come, tell me, there must be some wishes in your little heart!"

Snow White frankly admitted, "Yes, there are indeed my wishes in my heart."

The Queen hurriedly said, "Dear, you can just tell your wishes honestly, and they will definitely be fulfilled without fail."

Snow White took the apple and held it in her hand, but was stunned for a while, not knowing how to tell it her wish.

Just then, the seven dwarfs were busy working in their mine, when they suddenly saw the flying and walking little animals coming in a team, surrounding them and making a fuss. At first, they didn't pay attention and continued to work. But those little animals were still making so much noise that it was simply interfering with their work. The seven dwarfs were annoyed and wanted to find a way to drive them away, but they were of no use. The little birds opened their mouths and pecked at their hats, and the little beasts stretched out their claws and scratched their clothes. The situation was very serious and didn't seem like a joke.

Sleepy, although he is often sleepy, woke up at this time, and suddenly guessed the intentions of those little animals, and hurriedly said to his partners, "I think there must be a reason for them to come here, maybe our Snow White has fallen into the hands of that Queen!"

Doctor blurted out, "Yes, they are making so much noise to tell us about this, it's just a pity that they can't speak human language. Partners, let's quickly go and rescue Snow White! Defeat that hateful Queen!"

Hua Army Recovers Zengcheng, Fierce Fighting Unprecedented

Wengyuan: The Japanese army in Zengcheng was surrounded by the Hua army for three days and nights. Although the Japanese army relied on the natural hazards of the terrain, solid fortifications, and superior firepower to stubbornly resist, the soldiers of the Hua side fought valiantly with a determination to die, one after another, and finally captured the city at 2 AM on the 14th. The intensity of this fierce battle set a record for combat between the Chinese and Japanese armies in South China. The details of the battle are as follows: On the morning of the 12th, at 4 AM, the Hua army first recovered Pingfengling Manhuazhuang in the eastern suburbs of Zengcheng, as well as Guashushu Shejiatouling in the southwest suburbs, and Yangxi in the northwest, forming an encirclement and dividing troops to cut off the Japanese army's communication line between Shitan and Guangzhou. On the morning of the 13th, Liaocun in the northern suburbs of Zhucun on the western route was also successively recovered by the Hua army, intensifying the pressure on the Japanese army. At the same time, the Japanese army reinforced from Guangzhou and Shitan was intercepted and routed by the Hua army's blocking units. Until the evening, the Hua army advanced again and broke through the Japanese army's position at Pengwu, causing great chaos in the Japanese formation.

Japanese Army Besieged Everywhere in the Last Two Weeks

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated yesterday that it is true that the Hua army has been more active in the northern and southern war zones in the past two weeks, and that it has achieved great results in general. Speaking roughly, on the Guangdong front, the eastern route has recovered Wangmudian, reoccupied Fuhuxu, and surrounded Zengcheng. Yesterday, it stormed into the city. In the battle of Bietouxu in Conghua, more than 600 Japanese soldiers, including the battalion commander of the Mori battalion, were annihilated. After successively recovering key points such as Xinjie, Dalan, and Guanyao on the northern route, the Hua army besieged Huaxian and recovered it in a few days, causing the Japanese army entrenched in Shengang Taipingchang to be frightened. They have also repeatedly stormed into Jiangmen and Xinhui, and the Japanese army is exhausted in dealing with them. In addition, strongholds such as Shilong, Shitan, Foshan, and Sanshui are all under fierce siege by the Hua side. Even places in the suburbs of Guangzhou, such as Longyandong and Baiyun Mountain, are not without traces of the Hua army. The recent casualties and losses of the Japanese army in that area are even more difficult to count.

On the Jiangxi front, the Hua army occupied Gao'an, swept through Gaoyou City, attacked Dacheng, and forced Anxin, thwarting the Japanese army's attempt to invade west. As for the Japanese army invading south from Nanchang, it has always been confined near Liangjiadu, while the Hua army has taken the initiative and once attacked Xiangtang. Thus, the strength of the Hua and Japanese armies in that area is obvious even to those who are not wise. The Japanese army entrenched in Wuning has retreated to the suburbs after being attacked by the Hua army, relying on dangerous terrain to defend and not daring to take a step beyond the line.

On the Hunan-Hubei front, the Japanese army in northern Hunan has repeatedly threatened to invade south, but has not dared to act rashly to this day. Nanshan has been recovered by the Hua side, Yueyang has been besieged by the Hua side, and the entire northern section of Wuchang has been controlled by the Hua side. As for the Hua army in northern Hubei, it successively recovered Yuhuangmiao, Caijiahe, Xinhe, and Guandimiao, annihilating nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers. Yingshan and Xihe are both under siege by the Hua side. The Hua army in central Hubei crossed the Lishui River, occupied Changshoudian, captured Yangzi, threatened the north of Zhongxiang, captured XInji, occupied Xiaojiadian, surrounded the south of Zhongxiang, cut off the Jing-Zhong Road, occupied Haojiadian and Leigongdian, swept away the Japanese army in Yangdian, and threatened Anlu, Kuantianmen and Jingshan. The Japanese army in central Hubei has shown signs of wavering.

On the Henan front, the Hua army recovered Liulin, Xindian, and Fenghuangshan, besieged Xinyang, and swept away Shijiafan and Zhujiafan, causing panic among the Japanese army entrenched in Xinyang. As for eastern Henan, it entered Kaifeng twice and annihilated eight or nine hundred Japanese soldiers, crushing the puppet organization, which is enough to shock the international community.

On the Shanxi front, in the battle of Maochidu in southern Jin, more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed, making it impossible for the Japanese army to gain a foothold south of Zhongtiaoshan. The Hua army followed and pursued them like sweeping away fallen leaves in the wind. In less than three days, it successively recovered Dagou, Nanmo Town, and Ruicheng, and occupied Dongtailing, pressing on Jiexian. What were the results of the Hua army attacking Hejin, attacking Jingle, attacking Xiaxian, and capturing Fushan in western Jin?

In addition, the Subei region once recovered Bailingmiao, Hebei recovered Hejian Xinhai, Jiangsu recovered Yixing Haimen, and four iron bridges on the Jinpu Railway between Taian and Yishan were destroyed by the Hua side, making it impossible for the Japanese army to communicate on the Jinpu line, which is enough to show the shaking of the Japanese army's rear.

According to the proof of the above facts, it can be seen that the Japanese army has been besieged everywhere in the past two weeks, and the frequency of its deployments is enough to prove that it is exhausted from running around. The Japanese army has repeatedly declared internationally that "the Hua army's April counter-offensive is a blank check," probably wanting to use false propaganda to deceive the general public in its country.
