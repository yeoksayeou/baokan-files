Japanese Army Boldly Crosses the River to Invade the West, Ambushed with Numerous Deaths; Surrounded and Blockaded by Encirclement Troops, Remnants Flee to Jiang County; Chinese Commander Visits the Front Again, Morale Greatly Boosted

In order to lure the Japanese deep and annihilate them in one fell swoop, the Chinese army ordered troops in central Shanxi to circle behind the Japanese, and another unit retreated to the Yellow River along the border of Yichuan, Shaanxi. At that time, because the river was sealed by ice, the Chinese army, after crossing the river, immediately used bombs to break the ice and ambushed in separate locations. More than a thousand Japanese soldiers boldly crossed the river to invade the west. When the Japanese army advanced to the middle of the river, the Chinese army immediately used machine guns to fiercely strafe them. The number of Japanese soldiers who died in the river reached more than six hundred. The remnants fled backward and were blocked and attacked by the Chinese encirclement troops, resulting in many captures. More than a hundred remnants fled in a sorry state to Jiang County. As a result, several counties such as Jixian, Xiangning, etc., were completely recovered in a few days. (Telegram, 28th)

Editorial

### Where are the Youth of Shanghai Going?

At least several hundred thousand or even nearly a million young people currently live in Shanghai, including the native youth who have always lived in Shanghai, and the youth who have fled to Shanghai from various war zones and guerrilla areas after the August 13th Incident. The youth of Shanghai were originally the outstanding members of the country; even those who fled to Shanghai from various places were in fact above the average level in terms of economic ability and education. If such a large number and outstanding quality of young people were distributed to the mainland, they would undoubtedly be the most active members of the war of resistance camp. At the front line, in the rear, in the trenches, in the hospitals, and even in all work departments, their strength would be manifested everywhere. Now, the environment makes these many young people live in seclusion on an isolated island, the environment separates the active hearts of Shanghai youth from the areas suitable for their activity; at the same time, the current Shanghai, the educational facilities and cultural undertakings, the content shows an abnormal shrinkage, can never make young people feel satisfied. Therefore, a kind of depressed mental phenomenon is popular among the young people in Shanghai today. In the school composition papers, in the letters of young people, and in the readers' columns of newspapers, the sadness and indignation of young people are revealed everywhere. They do not mourn economic poverty, nor do they express the pain of unrequited love, but only state a kind of spiritual boredom that cannot express the work of saving the country. From the standpoint of the national country, this is certainly a good phenomenon of the progress of youth thought; but at the same time, it can also be said to be a contradictory fact of the inconsistency of supply and demand in the general mobilization of national manpower.

How to seek a way out for the youth of Shanghai can be said to be an important issue worthy of discussion in today's isolated island society. In the past, newspapers and other publications discussed this issue very enthusiastically. To sum up, there are only two kinds of views: The first view encourages young people to go to the mainland to do the work of saving the country, because so many vitality is stagnant on the isolated island, it is better to disperse them to useful places so that they can each get what they want; the second view believes that Shanghai is not without things to do, and young people do not necessarily have to participate in many direct work, it is better to stick to their posts and make efforts in their own positions. These two statements originally have their own reasons and their own drawbacks, because a few people with childish diseases or who hold the idea of苟安 can respectively defend his actions with that kind of wonderful words; at the same time, the correct path that each person takes often depends on the decision of his own environment, so despite the lengthy discussions, the way out for the youth on the isolated island is still a major problem.

Since the war of resistance has entered a new stage, the camp of the Chinese national war of resistance needs to be enriched again, so the problem of the way out for the youth of Shanghai should have a reasonable solution, at least the youth of Shanghai themselves should have a clear understanding. Every young person should carefully analyze his own environment, and at the same time carefully analyze his own abilities and personality. If the environment and ability both allow a young person to leave Shanghai, this young person may leave Shanghai, because this can exert more efficiency for the future of the war of resistance. Where to go after leaving Shanghai? In fact, it is currently better to go to the guerrilla areas around Shanghai than to go to the mainland, and the efficiency of work is higher. Because the second phase of the war of resistance is the most important period of guerrilla warfare, in the guerrilla areas, such as the implementation of military political work, the development of the people's non-cooperation movement, everywhere needs young people to participate; and young people on the isolated island to participate in this kind of work in the nearby guerrilla areas, not only the journey is closer, but also all the customs are easier to understand, it can be said to be a very suitable thing. If the environment does not allow a young person to leave Shanghai, he can only stay, but the so-called "post" and the so-called "positional effort" should be based on the standard of being definitely not away from the front line of the war of resistance. Otherwise, there is a suspicion of "苟安". How can it be considered not to leave the war of resistance front line? The most important thing is that every young person should participate in an organization for saving the country. Shanghai is not without work to do to save the country, but it is really impossible for an individual entity to save the country alone, only an organization can take action and only an organization can take effective action. Today, the four million people on the isolated island of Shanghai are all enthusiastically supporting the war of resistance and building the country, but they lack an organization to do a strong maintenance. This large organization of four million people should be started and used as a core by the youth organization of hundreds of thousands of people.

### Japan Continues to Manufacture an Atmosphere of Peace, but it is Impossible to Shake the Determination to Resist

Wu Peifu States He Will Not Be Used; Wang Jingwei Also Appears Depressed Recently

(Chongqing) Regarding the rumors that Wu Peifu will go to Kaifeng to take up the post of so-called "Chairman of the Pacification Committee," opinions from political circles are as follows: (1) The Japanese army is currently buying up frustrated Chinese figures in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places to call for peace, with Wu Peifu being the most well-known. The Japanese side claims that Wu Peifu will go to Kaifeng as a representative for peace talks. However, the Japanese side is still unaware that this is merely a dream because Chongqing does not want to negotiate peace. (2) The Japanese side attempts to use the Kaifeng area as a buffer zone to move the Japanese army in Xuzhou north to participate in the attack on Shanxi. The reason why the Japanese side sent Wu Peifu to Kaifeng is to create a false atmosphere of peace because Kaifeng is extremely close to the Chinese front lines. (3) Appointing Wu Peifu as "Chairman of the Pacification Committee" is another major error in the Japanese political strategy towards China. The Japanese side may not know that Wu Peifu is just as patriotic as the Kuomintang members in terms of resisting Japan. The Japanese side may mistakenly believe that the Chinese army will adopt a peaceful attitude towards Wu Peifu. It is quite possible that Wu Peifu will bring Japanese firearms in Kaifeng to return to the Chinese side. (4) Although the Japanese side wants to work hard to create an atmosphere of peace by using puppets, it continues to fight in Guangdong, Shanxi, and other areas. Therefore, the Chinese army will never lightly believe the lies of peace. Chongqing's determination to resist Japan will never waver. (American Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)

(Chongqing) Today, political figures here declared that the Japanese military authorities are still paying close attention to Wang Jingwei's actions. They hope that Wang Jingwei can come forward to organize a Guangzhou puppet government and want him to serve as the "President of the Guangzhou Government." Japanese agents travel between Hanoi and Hong Kong in an endless stream. As to whether Wang Jingwei will accept their "advice" or not, it is unknown. According to reports, Wang Jingwei is currently still in Hanoi, appears depressed, and adopts a "three nos" policy, namely, not participating in the puppet government, not advocating scorched-earth resistance, and not regarding the Hiranuma cabinet as an object for negotiating Sino-Japanese peace. Furthermore, according to reports, the Hiranuma cabinet has definitively abandoned Konoe's plan to organize a "central government." Hiranuma believes that it is most important to have the Chinese people subject to Japanese control. Organizing a "mixed government" or "central government" is deemed unnecessary. At the same time, he advocates inviting Wang Jingwei to use his past influence to organize a puppet government in South China to help Japan control China. It is said that wooing Wu Peifu is also part of Hiranuma's plan. (American Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)

(Chongqing) Political figures here were greatly amused to hear that the Japanese inspectors in Beiping changed Wu Peifu's personal telegram into a telegram addressed to the whole country. They called this a "laughable insult." This kind of trick is likely to strengthen Wu Peifu's anti-Japanese attitude. (American Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)

(Beijing) Recently, Wu Peifu's representative declared to foreign journalists here that over the past two days, there have been repeated reports of peace telegrams and speeches involving General Wu, etc., which are all untrue. These messages are all fabricated by the Japanese side, attempting to confuse domestic and foreign audiences, which is absolutely not the case. The representative finally said that General Wu is determined to uphold his previous spirit and integrity, strictly rejecting any threats or inducements, and will never do anything that would let down the common people. Now, all sectors of the Chinese community have heard this news and expressed their approval, believing that since Wu has decided not to be used by the Japanese side, Japan's conspiracy to seek peace has suffered another serious blow.

Unexpectedly, he was now assassinated and injured. It is also heard that during Wang Jingwei's recuperation period, all external contacts will be handled by his confidant, Zeng Zhongming.

A mining team has now been organized and is coming to Yunnan from Singapore to work. (Dispatch on the 28th)

### Chinese Academic Institutions Are Devastated; London Public Opinion is Extremely Outraged

The Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University Appeals to the Nation, Hoping to Provide Active Assistance to the Best of Their Ability

(London) Today's The Times published a letter from Gordon, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, appealing for Chinese universities. The letter reads, "General public opinion in Oxford is outraged by the destruction of Chinese universities. These universities are now forced to move to remote areas in the western provinces, practicing the ancient custom of Chinese education, lecturing without books or equipment. We, who are members of the scholarly community, feel obligated, as we have done our duty to Leuven after the European War and Tokyo after the earthquake. We now propose to cooperate with the International Student Service, the Joint Committee of Christian Universities in China, and the Chinese Committee of various universities, to the best of our ability, to supply Chinese universities with books, equipment, and any other possible assistance. As for relief work, the International Student Service has already started it and is quite effective, and we plan to let them handle it. The special needs of the twelve Christian universities in China will be handled by the Joint Committee. Someone has already promised to donate two thousand pounds to handle the above-mentioned activities, and promised to continue to donate three thousand pounds, provided that the university staff must contribute the same amount of funds. Cooperation is the key to achieving good results. Oxford University feels obligated to cooperate with other universities and related associations to carry out everything. We hope that all parties will respond, so that many hands make light work." (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)

### Japanese Diet Questions Concentrated on Diplomatic Issues

Yusuke Tsurumi Worries About International Isolation; Japan's Rear Area Construction is Completely Stalled, Showing That Finances Have Reached the End of the Road

Hong Kong Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese House of Representatives held a general meeting on the 27th, with the most questions focused on diplomacy. First, Yusuke Tsurumi of the Minseito Party, known for his diplomatic views, questioned the notes from Britain, the United States, and France. Tsurumi said that since the views of the three countries are different from Japan's, what methods will the cabinet use to make them understand? Arita replied that he would deal with it with an indomitable spirit. Military warfare requires long-term endurance, and ideological warfare and cultural warfare are also the same. Tsurumi also asked why the US note of December 31 was more lenient than before, and why the cabinet did not make further efforts. Arita replied that after the war is over, he will adopt specific policies to make them understand. From this response, it can be seen that Arita still leaves room for flexibility, and his intention is very clear. Shigeharu Kasai asked if there was a solution to the problems of navigation on the Yangtze River and the rights and interests of various countries in China. Arita replied that Japan is trying to resolve the issues between Japan and the United States and Britain as soon as possible. Kasai also asked if it was true that the army advocated advancing north and the navy advocated advancing south. Hiranuma replied that the army and navy are based on national policy and seek the development of national power, and there is no distinction between advancing south and advancing north. Kasai's words were an indirect question about the friction between the army and navy, and Hiranuma's answer was irrelevant. Seiyukai's Morita asked if failing to fully promote rear area construction would hinder "long-term construction." Hiranuma replied that due to the increase in military spending, rear area construction is inevitably stalled, but we must conserve energy and save other expenses to supplement the needs of rear area construction. From this question and answer, it can be seen that the construction of Japan's rear area has been completely stalled, and there is no more strength for the so-called "long-term construction." Japan's predicament is more than half evident. (Dispatch on the 28th)

### The Japanese Ministry of Finance Drains the Pond to Catch All the Fish

Decides to Increase Taxes to Make Up for the Budget and Compel People to Donate Money

(Hong Kong) According to semi-official news from Tokyo, in order to cope with the huge military expenditure of the war of resistance against Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Finance is now planning to increase tax revenue by 200 million yen to contribute to the special military budget, which will be submitted to the Diet for discussion in January. It is heard that the Japanese government will collect commodity taxes on high-end silk fabrics, silk tea, cocoa, soap, toothpaste, toys, electrical appliances, fruits, leather goods, automobiles, and rice wine. Taverns will also be charged banquet donations. The Ministry of Finance estimates that special profit taxes can be increased by 80 million yuan, company dividend taxes can be collected by 8 million yuan, commodity taxes can be increased by 36 million yuan, public debt interest tax by 1 million yuan, sugar consumption tax by 10 million yuan, non-alcoholic beverage tax by 2 million yuan, housing construction tax by 2 million yuan, and stamp tax by 1 million yuan. (Dispatch on the 28th)

(Tokyo) The Japanese Minister of Finance will submit a new bill within the next few days, granting the Japanese government the right to purchase gold nationwide. In other words, the Japanese people have the responsibility to completely dedicate or sell gold and gold jewelry to the government. Those who know it not only know that Japan has the heart to maintain its war against China by using everything it has, but also can see from this that the Japanese government is in a difficult situation, and its actions are close to draining the pond to catch all the fish.

### France and Japan Are Negotiating Over the Ambassador Issue

The French Government Will Only Agree if Masano Tani Retracts His Previous Statements

(Paris) The French government has not yet agreed to the Japanese government's intention to appoint Masano Tani as the ambassador to France because Tani made anti-French remarks last July. The French and Japanese governments are currently negotiating. It is heard that if Tani retracts his previous statements, France will agree to his appointment. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo News, Japan sent Tani Masano to France as ambassador, and sought France's consent. The French authorities refused to agree because Tani had publicly attacked France to reporters in Shanghai. Hiranuma and Arita were very embarrassed and convened a cabinet meeting on the 27th to discuss countermeasures. It was heard that it was decided that Arita would deal with it as the situation required, and temporarily dispatched his counselor at the embassy in France to act as chargé d'affaires. The Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying, "France's refusal to agree is very incomprehensible." During the General Assembly of the Noble Academy, Councilor Engutani also raised a question about this, but Arita said, "We are currently paying attention to France's attitude, but there is no intention to replace the ambassador." (Dispatch on the 28th)

Hong Kong According to a dispatch from Paris, regarding Japan's appointment of an ambassador to France, the right-wing Parisian "L'Echo de Paris" commented that it was surprising that the Japanese government had publicly publicized the matter of Japan's intention to appoint Masano Tani as ambassador to France before the French government had expressed its consent, which was a violation of custom.

### Welles Explains US Current Diplomatic Strategy; Safeguarding Rights Permitted by International Treaties; Resisting Threats to Security; Willing to Cooperate with All Countries to Eliminate Trade Barriers

(New York) Undersecretary of State Welles, in a speech at the New York Law Society yesterday, declared that the principles and objectives of American foreign policy include the following three points: (1) Expanding military preparations to achieve complete freedom of action at any time and to repel any attacks on the American continent. (2) Strengthening the political and economic relations with the countries of the American continent and countries around the world that can cooperate with the United States. (3) Cooperating with all countries to eliminate trade barriers and restore the principle of trust in international trade. Welles then commented on various important current political issues. First, he said that although the relations between the countries of the Americas have developed smoothly recently, some problems are still waiting to be resolved. Regarding this point, Welles emphasized that the Good Neighbor Policy cannot be effective unilaterally and must be based on reciprocity and mutual trust to be effective. Welles then mentioned the situation in the Far East, stressing that the US government will never recognize that any country has the right to abolish the rights and interests enjoyed by the United States in China under treaties, but is willing to discuss the modification of Far Eastern relations with China, Japan, and other signatory countries at any time. Mentioning the relationship between the United States and totalitarian governments, Welles declared, "We are willing to maintain friendly relations with all the peoples of the world and will never advise any people on the form of government." Finally, Welles solemnly declared that although the United States does not want to be involved in any foreign conflicts, it does not want to adhere to absolute neutrality, because the result of absolute neutrality is tantamount to promoting the ferocity of the aggressor and reducing the strength of the invaded country. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)

(New York) Undersecretary of State Welles said in a speech at the Law Society last night that in this troubled time for our modern civilization, the greatest goal of the US government's policy is to keep the United States at peace. At the same time, the American people and the government have reserved the power to protest and criticize the cruel and inhumane treatment applied to mankind in the event of any wild event occurring anywhere. The US government has also made it clear that if any foreign diplomatic policy threatens the peace and security of the United States, or if the result will be an infringement of the treaty rights enjoyed by the United States or its citizens, the US government will exercise its power to confront it when necessary. Welles then touched on the Far East issue, saying that the United States is prepared to discuss, in coordination with the countries with direct interests in that part of the world, including both China and Japan, any proposal based on reason and justice aimed at amending or deleting provisions in existing treaties.

### Roosevelt Asks Congress to Allocate Funds

To Replenish the Air Force

(Washington) President Roosevelt has requested Congress to immediately approve an appropriation of US$50 million, most of which will be used to purchase new aircraft related to the government's national defense program, and requested that the funds be allocated immediately so that they can be used in the remaining days of this fiscal year and the fiscal year from July 1 this year. Part of the funds will be used to implement the defense program listed in President Roosevelt's proposal to Congress on January 12 to purchase US$300 million in army aircraft. Of this 50 million, 46,442,000 yuan will be used for the air force program. According to the government, this amount can purchase 565 new fighter planes. In addition, the president also requested 4,490,000 yuan to purchase radio equipment and 67,000 yuan to purchase weapons to be used on the above-mentioned aircraft. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)

### Rumor Has It That Britain, the United States, and France Have Signed a Secret Agreement

American-Made Aircraft Supplied to France Attracts Great Attention from All Parties

(Washington) According to rumors from political circles here, Britain, the United States, and France have signed a "secret agreement." This news was leaked when the Senate Armed Services Committee investigated the incident of members of the French Air Force participating in test flights of the latest American bombers, attracting great attention. Of course, this kind of report cannot be confirmed, but well-informed sources believe that this kind of agreement exists. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt announced that American aircraft manufacturers, with the consent of the government, have agreed to supply the French government with an unspecified number of aircraft. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)

(Washington) The Senate Military Committee has begun reviewing the French purchase of 600 military aircraft from the United States for 65 million US dollars, with the aim of determining whether this purchase agreement contains traces of a Franco-American alliance. At the same time, it is also protecting American military inventions and will investigate whether the Treasury Department has provided France with payment facilities. (American Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)

(Washington) When President Roosevelt received reporters today, one reporter asked whether the US government would provide convenience for France to purchase aircraft from American manufacturers. The President immediately gave a negative answer, but also said that the reasons for the French government to purchase aircraft are very clear. The US State Department, when discussing this matter, had decided to cooperate with it. This kind of cooperation is practically conducive to the advancement of the American aircraft manufacturing program. In other words, the American aircraft manufacturing expansion program has not yet been implemented. The French government's order of new aircraft from American factories can allow these factories to prepare in advance so that they can be more skilled when the Japanese government places orders. For this reason, the government decided to allow France to order aircraft from domestic factories, and at the same time informed the French government that it was a good thing for that country to order aircraft from the United States. Rumors that the government would lend funds to France and that Britain intends to continue ordering aircraft from the United States are not accurate. As for the death of Schmidtlin, a representative of the French Ministry of Aviation, in a bomber test flight accident, this aircraft was originally owned by a private factory, and the US government had never ordered it from the factory. There was nothing strange about Schmidtlin participating in the test flight. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)

### Former British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China Advocates Baldwin Visit Japan

(London) Today's "Daily Telegraph" published a letter from Sir Kelly, former British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, discussing the proposal of a Japanese newspaper that British Prime Minister Chamberlain or Foreign Secretary Halifax should accept an invitation to visit Japan, saying that government figures cannot be away from London for a long time at present. However, if a person is selected to form an informal small delegation to Japan, which can discuss matters with Japanese cabinet members on equal terms, but not representing the British government, only expressing the general opinions of the British people, then this trip may not be without benefit. A statesman like Lord Baldwin can serve as the leader of the delegation, and the Sino-Japanese dispute may be restored to peace through this trip. He is very optimistic about this.

### Moscow Announces Progress of Soviet-Japanese Fishery Negotiations

Soviet Reply Upright and Firmly Rejects Japanese Demands; New Agreement Must Be Based on Fishery Auction

Moscow - Regarding the Soviet-Japanese fishery negotiations, after the Soviet Dalrybflot (Far Eastern Fisheries Trust) announced that a fishery auction would be held on March 15th of this year, Japanese Ambassador Togo and Litvinov exchanged several notes and memoranda.

Japanese Note Content

In the Japanese Ambassador's note and memoranda, while acknowledging that the fishery preparation period had already begun, it was deemed inappropriate for the Soviet side to announce an auction while negotiations were still in progress. It was generally recognized that the Soviet government had no right to unilaterally declare an auction, and that the auction allegedly violated Japanese fishing rights, rendering those rights insignificant. The Japanese Ambassador also continued to oppose the Soviet government's proposal to reclaim several fishing grounds from the Japanese side. In his opinion, any change to the current situation and disruption of "stability" would "strike a blow to the special historical circumstances of the Japanese people." The Soviet government's reclamation of such fishing grounds for military reasons, it was argued, turned an economic problem into a political one, and for military reasons, allegedly could not be included in any agreement. The Japanese government could agree to the reclamation of these fishing grounds, but only if an equal number of fishing grounds of equal value were allocated elsewhere to compensate, so that "stability" could be maintained. The Ambassador also reiterated the verbally communicated assertions made in past negotiations, stating that the Soviet government must consider the potential conflicts and consequences.

Soviet Rebuttal

Litvinov's note and memoranda pointed out the contradictions in the Japanese Ambassador's document, the lack of basis for Japanese demands, and firmly stated that "Japanese fishermen have always particularly hoped that the auction dates would be announced in advance, so that they could adequately prepare for the fishing season. The continuation of fishery negotiations does not restrict the Soviet government's freedom of action, because the Soviet government has long explicitly stated that the new agreement must be based on fishery auctions. Auctions of fishing grounds near the Soviet coast, within Soviet territorial waters, and belonging to the Soviet Union can only be unilaterally conducted by the Soviet government, as it is a matter of Soviet government sovereignty. Public and agreed-upon deadlines that have already passed should not be cited as the Japanese Ambassador has done. As for the Treaty of Portsmouth, even its fundamental spirit and wording have undoubtedly been violated by Japan, and there is absolutely no conflict with the principle of auctions. That treaty also does not stipulate that Japan can arbitrarily demand any fishing grounds belonging to the Soviet Union, nor any number of fishing grounds. After that treaty came into effect, the Japanese only managed to operate in over a hundred fishing grounds for many years, while now they can lease over three hundred through auctions. As for the claim that fishing grounds once leased by the Japanese should forever belong to the Japanese, and can only be exchanged for other fishing grounds, that is completely unreasonable.

The Japanese Ambassador's claim that the Soviet government's auction is illegal is entirely arbitrary, without any obligation or reason based on any Soviet promises. The Japanese side must recognize that these fishing grounds are Soviet state property and should be handled by the Soviet government. The Japanese side can only use them based on an agreement with the Soviet government, and their status is only that of lessees. The method of exercising rights by mutual consent in recent years has already passed, and the Soviet government bears no obligation. The continuation or modification of this method can only be decided by the Soviet government's goodwill. At the same time, the Soviet government has no obligations regarding the so-called "historical sentiments of the Japanese people," even if the claim that such sentiments are severely affected by the reduction in the number of fishing grounds is valid.

The Soviet government has absolutely no intention of turning the fishery problem into a political problem, but this does not mean that the Soviet side must ignore the Japanese government's policy towards the Soviet Union and the public declarations of Japanese government officials regarding the aims of that policy, and should not take necessary measures to defend its borders and coasts. Attention to national defense is naturally derived from any public or agreed-upon right of the Soviet government, and is its natural, indisputable, and inviolable right. The Soviet government believes that all demands that do not arise from its own formal obligations but are arbitrarily made cannot be tolerated. As far as the Japanese government's policy towards the Soviet Union is concerned, the Japanese side has no political or moral reason to make demands on the Soviet government beyond the latter's formal obligations. Since the Japanese side has been given the possibility of leasing fishing grounds through auctions, the obligations of the Treaty of Portsmouth have been fully fulfilled. If Japanese fishermen participate in the auction, their interests will be guaranteed to be satisfied to a full extent; if they do not participate in the auction, these interests will be damaged, and all consequences will occur.

As for the intimidation tactics implied in the Japanese Ambassador's words, and more openly stated in Japanese newspapers, they are generally worthless, do not benefit Japanese fishermen in any way, and cannot affect the completely fair attitude of the Soviet government. (TASS dispatch, 28th)

### Britain and France Pay Attention to Soviet Diplomatic Movements

Russian Ambassador Clearly States to Britain that It Will Still Abide by Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Obligations

(London) Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax last night. The purpose of the visit was not disclosed. This matter has attracted attention because Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz also met with French Foreign Minister Bonnet last night. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon, informing him of the discussions between British and Italian cabinet members in Rome. Ambassador Maisky explained the trade negotiations to be conducted between the Soviet Union and Germany. Regarding this matter, Soviet sources here said that these negotiations were initiated by Germany. Germany may take the opportunity to inquire about the Soviet Union's attitude if something were to happen in Western Europe in the future. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, will maintain close contact with Poland. Earlier this month, Polish Foreign Minister Beck provided information on the situation in the Soviet Ukrainian Republic when he spoke with German leader Hitler, and told him that it was unlikely that the Ukrainian state could be separated. This was intended to divert Germany's attention to the West, which is commendable. In addition, the current Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union should assist France with military force if Germany attacks France, but if France is invaded by Italy, this mutual assistance treaty will not automatically come into effect. If the member states of the League of Nations can invoke the Covenant at that time, the Soviet Union can still provide assistance to France in accordance with the terms of the Covenant.

### German Trade Director to Go to Moscow

News Already Confirmed

Moscow - The report that Schnurre, Director of the Trade Department of the German Foreign Ministry, is coming here has been confirmed by well-informed sources here. It is said that Director Schnurre's trip was initiated by the German side. The purpose of his mission is still unknown. It may be that the country intends to maintain normal relations with Soviet Russia, or even seek to improve bilateral trade relations, to prevent other countries from taking the opportunity to enter. In short, Schnurre's trip at least proves that the Ukrainian issue is not very pressing at the moment. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### German Foreign Minister Returns to Berlin from Warsaw

Germany and Poland to Form Joint Committee to Handle Minority Issues

(Berlin) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned here from Warsaw last night. It is reported that as a result of the talks between the German and Polish foreign ministers, it was decided to establish a committee specializing in discussing minority issues based on the guidelines declared in 1937, with administrative issues as its main task. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Warsaw - Polish officials declared that the greatest achievement of the current German-Polish talks was the renewed assurance of the continued validity of the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. In other words, Germany has indicated that it has no intention of making territorial claims on the Polish Corridor or Polish Ukraine. It is said that the main purpose of the German Foreign Minister's visit to Warsaw was to reaffirm and develop the policy of that treaty. The experiment of the past five years has shown its effectiveness, so there is absolutely no reason to draw up a new agreement. Officials also reiterated that Poland opposes the policy of encircling Germany, and Poland does not want to hinder Germany's natural development. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

### Famous French Politician Discusses the National Situation

Germany and Italy Will Regret Helping Japan; European War Unlikely to Break Out for the Time Being

Singapore - After traveling through the Far East, French politician and former member of the Daladier cabinet, Fievez, set off for Europe. He declared when passing through Singapore that Germany and Italy, who have not stood alongside other European powers in a common front in the Far East to confront Japan, will surely regret it in the future. Fievez also said that it was a major blow that the German and Italian governments had not understood the need for Europe to take a common front against Japan. However, most German and Italian observers in the Far East believe that Germany and Italy will surely greatly regret their actions in the future. He believes that it is absolutely necessary for the naval, land, and government leaders of French Indochina, the Philippines, and the three Malay states to maintain contact with each other. He expects Europe to maintain peace because he is convinced that Italy does not want to fight, and Germany does not want to fight Britain and France for Italy's sake. Germany will be busy in Central and Eastern Europe for several years, and if Britain and France remain strong, there will be no danger of war in the West. It is noted that Fievez joined the cabinet in 1933-34 when Daladier was Prime Minister, and is now the Secretary-General of the French Radical Party and the Secretary-General of the International Consultation of European Liberal Democratic Parties.

### Britain Warns Dictatorships; Imperial Strength Not to Be Insulted; Naval Minister Announces Great Shipbuilding Program; Political and Financial Leaders Jointly Declare; News of Promoting British-German Cooperation Eliminates War Atmosphere

(London) Britain's attitude towards the dictatorships has suddenly become much tougher. On this day when the Spanish war has entered a critical juncture, important officials of the British cabinet have issued warnings, asking the dictatorships not to ignore the strength of the British Empire. According to Naval Minister Stanhope, in 1938, Britain launched an average of more than one warship per week. Therefore, proceeding at this rate, Britain will be able to become the strongest naval power in the world naval race. "At present, no shipbuilding plan in Japan, France, Germany, or Italy can compare with our country in scale. Furthermore, although our current naval power has surpassed all countries, it will be greatly strengthened in the next two or three years." Moreover, Britain's current shipbuilding is unprecedented in British peacetime. "Important warships currently under construction include seven battleships, twenty-one cruisers, twenty-nine destroyers, fifteen submarines, and five aircraft carriers. At the same time, four of the seven battleships are ready to be launched this year." Air Minister Wood also stated that Britain's aircraft production in 1938 has more than doubled compared to the past, and is expected to increase to three times that amount this year. "As for the quality, it is also better than ever before." Home Secretary Hoare also stated the day before yesterday that the position of the British Empire has reached an impregnable level. May ambitious countries not repeat the mistakes of 1914. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

(London) Lord Stanhope, the Naval Minister, recently published an article in the "Our Country and Empire" magazine, explaining the situation of British naval shipbuilding. It stated that it is not easy and there is no certainty in comparing our country's naval power with other countries. The best way is to compare the number of capital ships. Japan has a total of nine capital ships, Germany has five, Italy has four, and our country has as many as fifteen. Four newly built capital ships can also be launched within this year. In addition, there are more than four hundred warships of various types, including sixty cruisers, one hundred and sixty-nine destroyers, and fifty-four submarines. In the event of war, many merchant ships and fishing boats can be converted for military use. Our country's naval superiority can be seen from this. It can be asserted that the strength will be even greater in two or three years. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

(London) Many British celebrities today signed and issued an appeal to Hitler and the German people, asking to eliminate the war clouds in Europe through international understanding. The declaration solemnly stated that Britain does not hate Germany. Britain only hopes to maintain its own freedom and does not want to suppress other countries. Germany has now become a strong country, and its actions cannot but have a significant impact on the international situation. It is hoped that those in power will replace the attitude of hostility with a spirit of cooperation, so as to obtain British-German cooperation and eliminate the fog of war in Europe. The British celebrities who signed this declaration include former Indian Governor-General the Marquess of Willingdon, the Governor-General of Canada, the Earl of Derby, Viscount Dawson, Royal Physician Sir Horder, Bank of England Governor Norman, former Education Minister Sir Percy, and many university professors.

### Spanish Government Declares; Vow to Continue Fighting

It is Our Unquestionable Duty to Stop Foreign Aggression; New Positions Established in Northern Catalonia

Gerona City, Northern Spain - Republican Government Prime Minister Negrín recently issued a proclamation to the people, stating that the domestic and foreign enemies of Spain are already at the end of their ropes. In order to struggle for survival, like trapped beasts fighting, they can only take offensive action as a desperate gamble. Thus, they were fortunate enough to succeed in the Battle of Barcelona. Fortunately, the government army is now mobilizing the central main force to the front line, and will be able to contain the impact of the aggressors. As for the supply of military equipment, the government has also overcome the difficulties of the non-intervention policy pursued by various countries and the naval blockade by the rebels, and has obtained a large number of supplies. Although it is somewhat late, it is not too late. The subsequent confrontation will surely reflect the glorious battle of defending the city of Madrid. In short, "We are rich in the spirit of sacrifice and will surely win the final victory." (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Madrid - General Gasa Du, the Deputy Commander of the Republican Army in the Madrid front, published an article here yesterday, saying that the war will not stop for a day as long as Spain needs to ensure that it is not invaded by foreign countries. Now the aggressors are announcing peace, but we see a widespread tragedy rapidly approaching us. We will definitely fight and not lose our trust. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Barcelona Garrison Retreats According to Planned Scheme

Rebel Army Divides Its Forces Into Three Routes to Continue Advancing North

(Paris) The Spanish government army issued a war report from Girona City last night, saying that the government army retreated in advance and voluntarily abandoned the city for fear that Barcelona City might be surrounded on all sides. The National Army occupied the city on the 26th. At that time, the city had a total population of 2 million, but most of them were women, children, and the elderly. There are still fierce battles in Solsuna, Turia, Manresa, Sabadell, Mangano and other places. The two sides are at a stalemate. The government army is in high morale and has unified military discipline. They are all determined to defend the new positions. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Perpignan - The numerous forces of the puppet government are now retreating in an orderly manner, but their ability to resist is only to provide cover in the rear, so that much of their ammunition can be safely moved to southern Spain. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Barcelona - The city has now gradually returned to normal. The security of the city is now maintained by the militia. Most of the National Army troops have withdrawn from the city. The wharves and old city areas have been heavily damaged by repeated air raids. Most of the houses are still burning. Refugees are streaming along the streets. Looting is inevitable. As for the war on the front line, the National Army occupied Badelona and several places in Sabadell today, seizing a lot of military supplies and capturing about 2,000 government soldiers. They are now advancing on three routes. The first route advances from the north of Solosona City towards Livour City, the second route advances from Manresa City towards Vic City, and the third route advances from Sabadell towards Granollers City.

### The French-Spanish Border; A Picture of Refugees

Wives and Children Separated, Crying From Hunger and Cold

Perpignan - The disturbances in the Figueres area are difficult to describe. Officials are looking for office locations, ministers are searching for subordinates, loving mothers are searching for their children along the way, and disaster-stricken children are crying from hunger and cold. It is a tragic scene that is shocking to the eye. The authorities are now making every effort to rectify the situation and prevent refugees from pouring into French territory. Sentries have been deployed along the French-Spanish border. At night, lights are lit along the border to prevent people from crossing the border. In several places along the way, the snow is knee-deep, and laborers are working to clear it. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(Paris) Several thousand refugees have poured into the French-Spanish border, and the situation is very tense. Yesterday, more than 10,000 refugees arrived in Puigseda, near the French-Spanish border, wanting to cross the border to French territory, but were blocked by the government's army and police guards. The French authorities are deeply afraid of this situation, because the more refugees gather, the harder it is for the guards to resist the strength of the crowd and prevent them from crossing the border in search of safety. The mayor of Bourg-Madame, a city near the French border, recently issued an urgent request to the authorities to mobilize the militia to prevent riots. High-ranking political leaders of the Spanish government, such as the former Governor of Valencia, have taken refuge in France. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

### Following the Chilean Earthquake, An Epidemic Breaks Out

Authorities Effortlessly Undertake Relief Work; The Number of Dead and Injured Continues to Increase

(Washington) Yesterday afternoon, the Chilean Embassy here announced that the recent Chilean earthquake had claimed the lives of more than 30,000 people and injured more than 50,000. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)

Santiago, Chile: After the violent earthquake in various southern parts of the Chilean capital, the exact number of residents who died is still unknown. New corpses are being discovered every hour. It is generally estimated that the total number is no less than 25,000. An epidemic has now broken out in the disaster areas and is spreading rapidly. In addition to sending a large number of doctors with medicines to provide assistance, the government is also trying to relocate refugees from the disaster areas to other places. (Havas, 28th)

Santiago, Chile: After the major earthquake in Chile, transportation has gradually resumed today, and reports of deaths and injuries are even worse than before. The disaster area covers 4,000 square miles. The government is working hard to prevent disease and provide famine relief. In this earthquake disaster, a total of 20,000 people have died. The Ministry of Labor officially estimates that 8,000 bodies have already been buried. Coffins are currently in short supply. Military officers directing relief efforts say that relief efforts in many places have had to be abandoned because the stench from unburied corpses is a major obstacle to public health. Linares has become the center for conducting relief efforts, and there is also a major relief camp near Concepcion. Residents of the most severely affected areas have been evacuated. The authorities are carrying out disinfection work everywhere. Today, the President and cabinet members went to the disaster area to inspect and direct relief efforts. (Associated Press, 27th)

(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance announced today that it has decided to lift the ban on remittances abroad so that public donations to Chilean earthquake victims can be remitted to that country. Regulations on foreign exchange control prohibit remittances abroad. The Japan Chamber of Commerce and the Japan Exporters' Association, which have business relations in Latin America, have jointly donated 15,000 yen, equivalent to 100,000 Chilean pesos. Half of the amount has already been remitted to the Chilean government in cash to provide relief to earthquake victims, and the other half will be used to purchase goods to assist in relief efforts. The seismograph at the Tokyo Central Meteorological Observatory recorded this earthquake at 12:52 PM on January 25th. It is calculated that the distance from Japan to Chile through the earth's core is 1,700 kilometers, taking 20 minutes. (Reuters, 28th)

### Arms Fraud Case: Continued Trial Yesterday

(London) The arms fraud case continued its trial yesterday. One of the defendants, Fritwelling, testified that he was of British descent but is now Dutch. He joined his son's company in 1936 as a consultant. He has known Corgan for about 15 years, first meeting him at a racecourse in Belgium, where he was quite famous. He had no dealings with Corgan and only tipped his hat in greeting when they passed each other. He was very angry when his son told him that Lyford's cash of £5,250 had been handed over to Mr. Corgan, with a receipt issued by a Chinese man named Zhou. He told his son that such transactions were never paid in cash and that he should quickly find a way to remedy the situation. Later, his son told him about the "waste" discovered in Marseille. He then visited Zhou and Mr. Corgan. During the meeting, he called them both swindlers. Zhou remained silent, only smiling. The defendant also answered questions from the public prosecutor, saying that he trusted Zhou but not Mr. Corgan. The lawyer said that there was no doubt that Mr. Zhou was a swindler. Willingly said yes, but he did not want to call him an ignoble person. The case was adjourned to the 30th of this month and is expected to end on that day. (Reuters, 28th)

### Western Newspaper Reports Two Startling Cases Occurring Near Beiping

Guerrillas Kidnap Italian Postal Director; Regular Chinese Army Destroys Train Between Beiping and Tianjin

Special correspondent for the North-China Daily News, dispatched from Beiping on January 14th. In recent months, Japanese military communiques have been pleased to use the term "mopping-up operations." At Japanese receptions for reporters, one can hear spokespersons reporting on Japanese troops conducting "mopping-up operations" in a certain place. However, the Japanese side had already stated over a year ago that Japanese troops were conducting "mopping-up operations" in that area. Or the locations mentioned by the Japanese are increasingly close to Beiping. Therefore, whether the Japanese use of the term "mopping-up operation" is appropriate has already raised doubts. I believe the term "mopping-up" is not a proper descriptive term; the term "harassment" is closer to the truth. If "mopping-up" means annihilation, then the guerrillas have not been completely wiped out. They are only driven out of one area and immediately reappear in another area. Two recent incidents can prove this point, and these two incidents are even more shocking because they occurred in the suburbs of Beiping. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese side told reporters that the Japanese army had made great victories in the "mopping-up operations" in the mountains since January 5th, and completely annihilated the "bandits." But only three days later, a team of guerrillas dressed in military uniforms came down from those mountains and kidnapped a foreigner on a busy highway with frequent vehicle traffic, very close to the Japanese garrison. The kidnapped person was Mr. Praetti, the Italian postal director of the Beiping Post Office. Mr. Praetti often went to places that the Japanese authorities strongly claimed to be completely peaceful to spend his holidays on Sundays. On January 8th, Mr. Praetti, along with a Russian woman friend and a Chinese chauffeur and cook, took a car to the Ming Tombs. This place is less than 20 miles north of Beiping and about 2 miles from Changpingzhou, a small town with a long-term Japanese garrison. Mr. Praetti and others drove about a mile past the Ming Tombs and parked by the roadside for a meal. In the middle of the meal, a team of armed Chinese in uniforms suddenly appeared and asked Mr. Praetti and others questions. Mr. Praetti and others thought they were local police or militia, so they did not pay much attention. But when the chauffeur told them that his master was Italian, their attitude changed immediately. They tied up Mr. Praetti and others and searched them, flashing that Mr. Praetti was an Italian who was colluding with the enemy country Japan to endanger China, so they had no respect for him. If the chauffeur had said that his master was a citizen of a certain democratic country, they might not have obstructed him, but Mr. Praetti's car also had an Italian flag, so even if the chauffeur had not said this, they might still have recognized it. The team of armed Chinese seemed to have a heated discussion on whether to execute Mr. Praetti, but in the end, they set fire to Mr. Praetti's car and calmly escorted the four people to the mountains in the northwest to interrogate them. The Japanese garrison in Changpingzhou was obviously still sound asleep in the daytime. The next morning, the Italians learned of this matter. The so-called puppet government was helpless about this. Later, a Chinese person went to mediate and paid a ransom. The guerrillas refused to accept counterfeit puppet currency, so what was paid was all legal tender. The Russian woman and the chauffeur were released, but Mr. Praetti and the cook were still detained because this was a political incident and required instructions from Chongqing first. This matter spread throughout Beiping the next day. The Japanese authorities seemed ashamed of this and turned to put great pressure on foreign visitors here, preventing them from telegraphing this matter to other places. The Japanese clearly hoped that Mr. Praetti would be released within a few hours and that this matter could quietly pass without being noticed by the outside world. But unfortunately, as of the time of this manuscript, Mr. Praetti is still detained in the mountains. The second incident, although rarely mentioned in the local newspapers, is even more shocking. At about 6:00 PM on January 11th, about 500 Chinese cavalrymen dressed in military uniforms attacked the railway halfway between Beiping and Tianjin, two miles from Langfang, while the Japanese army had a strong garrison in Langfang. The Chinese army dismantled a very long section of the railway track and set fire to a long line of freight trains loaded with cotton, only retreating the next morning. Railway traffic was suspended for 36 hours. Only one train ran on Thursday, but passengers had to walk across the destroyed railway tracks and change trains at the other end. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese are either indulging in self-deception or have no real ability. But Japanese officials are completely satisfied with pacifying North China. Recently, a Japanese military spokesperson told a foreign reporter that 95% of the "bandits" in eastern Hebei and around Beiping have been "annihilated." The reporter said that the remaining 5% must be extremely active. Judging from the above-mentioned incidents and the unofficial news that has been trickling in from Shanxi and other parts of the interior, the Japanese optimism has no guarantee at all. Unless the Japanese army reinforces a very large number of troops, they will soon discover that the guerrillas are an extremely difficult military problem.

### Japanese Side Purchases Local Bandits in Fujian Border Area

Japanese Special Service Organ Newly Formulates Action Program; Chaoshan and Meixian Counties Plan to Prevent Japanese Side

Shantou Correspondence: Regarding the Chaoshan area, the Japanese army has recently changed to a policy of appeasement. On one hand, they attack China's necessary military measures and alienate official-civilian cooperation. On the other hand, they buy off alienated elements with petty favors, making them the Japanese army's henchmen. It is heard that the Japanese army's special service organ in South China has formulated a political offensive, economic monopoly, action program for the new year. All areas without immediate military action will adopt new methods, starting from the political and economic aspects. Currently, coastal fishermen and unemployed and displaced young people are their targets for enticement and recruitment. The Chaoshan authorities have taken strict precautions, and the police bureau and popular organizations are investigating in all directions, preventing bad people from sneaking in to carry out activities. In mid-January, they successfully cracked down on a sailboat smuggling tungsten ore for export on a boat in Mianhu, Jieyang, intercepting thousands of catties of tungsten ore. Chen Yihou, who poisoned wells in Chao'an, was also arrested and executed by firing squad. It is also heard that the Japanese side has bought off bandits on the Fujian border, organizing the so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," purchasing armed guns and ammunition from the people at high prices, with the intention of reducing the people's self-defense forces. The Chaoshan and Meixian counties have specially formed a joint defense office on the Fujian-Guangdong border. Meijiaoping three counties have set up a joint defense, and Purao three counties have also set up a joint defense. All coastal villages must strictly implement five-family joint guarantees. The Shantou Support Association has specially set up a wartime people's training institute, dividing them into classes for merchants, workers, women, young people, and children, etc., which are responsible for training by various organizations. They have already begun to recruit outstanding members to be sent to work in various organizations, with the aim of mobilizing the people and consolidating their confidence in the War of Resistance. Xingning and other counties have widely established rear hospitals, recruiting military doctors and pharmacists. The wartime work supervision team organized by the Fourth War Zone has now been sent to work in the Chaoshan and Meixian counties, targeting the Japanese side's political offensive program and implementing supervision of the people. Its responsibilities are as follows: (1) Promoting popular armed self-defense; (2) Eliminating traitors; (3) Setting up relay outposts; (4) Forming transportation teams; (5) Forming rescue teams; (6) Maintaining the discipline of the self-defense army. The above new lineup has been started this spring, teaching and organizing at the same time, and consolidating everyone's belief in victory. As for the work of attracting popular support, it is also proceeding step by step. Lin Weimin, the Shantou Party Affairs Commissioner, was prosecuted after being detained for corruption and bending the law. The financial system of the counties is not allowed to be disrupted, and no new donations and taxes may be levied. In the occupied areas such as Nan'ao, field taxes and donations will be exempted for one year to show a refreshing political situation and crush the Japanese conspiracy to sow discord. Coastal fishermen have suffered the most since the War of Resistance, with more than 10,000 casualties, and they will never be tempted by sweet words. Recently, Japanese warships on the sea have again carried out burning and looting of Chaoyang fishing boats, revealing their true colors, which is almost contrary to the so-called policy of appeasement by the Japanese side.

### Japanese Army in Yangzhou Plans to Defend Itself

Japanese Side Buys Out Bandits to Organize Puppet Pacification Teams

Ogawa, the commander of the Japanese army in Yangzhou, and Tsuchiya, the commander of the Japanese military police, are now colluding with two or three hundred hoodlums and local ruffians in Aozi Street and various places in Guazhou, using the names of the Red Spear Society and the Big Knife Society, using evil arts to fool the villagers. The commander gathered about 300 hoodlums to parade in the city, wearing white cloths on their heads, yellow amulets on their bodies, holding the Japanese flag and the five-color flag, and big knives, etc. The hoodlums acted as accomplices of the tiger, harassing the people. The people could not bear the harassment and automatically joined the guerrillas to participate in killing the enemy and eliminating the local ruffians to protect the good. It is also heard that Ogawa and others have decided to reorganize the Red Spear Society's hoodlums into pacification troops for their own use.

Recent situation here: (1) The captain of the Japanese military police team originally stationed in Yangzhou was transferred to another location, and the vacancy is still filled by Tsuchiya. (2) More than 30 students in the first batch of the Japanese language school set up by the Japanese army in Yangzhou graduated at the end of last year and went to various Chinese training classes for training, intending to incite and numb Chinese youth. (3) The Japanese army recently appointed a certain translator of the puppet police bureau as the pseudo "Autonomous Association" in the northwest township, and also appointed Lu Zhengting as the director of the western township pseudo police security bureau. (4) The Xian Shao pseudo "Autonomous Association" is now forcing the people to obtain "good citizen certificates." Various guarantees along the Xian Shao Highway have been forced to obtain them under the power of the Japanese and puppets.

Japanese Side Forcibly Conscripts Laborers to Build the Yangzhou-Tian Road

—Jiangwan Gentlemen Remotely Honor the Tomb of Unnamed Heroes—

Yesterday marked the seventh anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance. All sectors of the city believe that the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance seven years ago was the beginning of resisting aggression and the starting point of national rejuvenation. Now, the all-out War of Resistance has entered its second phase. Countless loyal and brave soldiers are following in the footsteps of the martyrs of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance seven years ago, advancing wave upon wave, fighting with their blood for the future of national rejuvenation. The entire country has formed unprecedented unity, and the international situation is also improving daily. The final victory to wash away national humiliation is not far off.

City Flies Flags at Half-Mast and Observes Silence to Express Grief

All organs, public groups, companies, businesses, schools, and households in the city all flew flags at half-mast yesterday, with national emblems flying everywhere, creating an enthusiastic atmosphere. They also ate vegetarian food for a day to express their condolences. People from all walks of life also stood in silence at their respective locations at 12 noon for three minutes to express their grief for the war-dead soldiers and martyred compatriots. Various groups sent telegrams to the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the soldiers fighting the war, expressing their condolences and paying their respects.

Shops Participate Enthusiastically in Charity Sales

Various companies and shops in the city held charity sales for one day yesterday to donate money to the government and commemorate the War of Resistance. The time was from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. All companies and shops were eager to save the country and participated very enthusiastically. The proceeds from the charity sales will be handed over to a major bank in the city this morning and presented to the government. The method is the same as before for donations.

Entertainment Venues Closed for One Day

Yesterday, on the anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance, all entertainment venues in the city, such as Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, amusement parks of various companies, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, etc., voluntarily closed for one day to raise awareness. All Chinese commercial radio stations, such as Dalu, Zhongxi, and Guohua, etc., also stopped broadcasting entertainment programs. All sectors also stopped banquets.

Conserve and Help the Needy, Continue to Donate Money

All sectors are determined to continue the donation campaign to support the government and complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation, to strengthen the forces of resistance. The "One Dollar to Repay Debt" campaign is also being vigorously promoted to strengthen international confidence in aid to China. Furthermore, since the War of Resistance, compatriots in the war zones have been displaced and their situation is miserable. At this severe winter season, rescue cannot be delayed. It is determined to continue to promote conservation to help the needy, collect winter clothes and relief food, and benefit the displaced compatriots.

Public Morale in Concessions Feels Excited

Yesterday's January 28th commemoration, the authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent accidents, were on strict alert. From early yesterday morning, they had increased the number of detectives patrolling the streets, and anyone suspected was checked. Important sections, such as Edward Road at the junction of the British and French concessions, and Nanjing Road in the central district of the Public Concession, Caojiadu in the western district, and Jessfield Road, were all patrolled by police vehicles back and forth to maintain vigilance. Yesterday, all day, until the reporter filed the report, only patriotic youth were distributing commemorative leaflets on the streets, and no other accidents occurred, which was quite peaceful.

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that today (the 28th) police officers and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps are patrolling the streets of the two concessions and stationed at important locations to pay attention to pedestrians) to guard against any possible disturbances regarding the Shanghai War Commemoration Day. Last night, the police stations in the Public Concession conducted a large-scale search and arrested more than 150 suspects. Yesterday afternoon, six hand grenades and ten bullets were found. The investigation is still underway this morning. The hand grenades, etc., were found in a garbage can in a lane on Jiaozhou Road and have been handed over to the Putuo Road Police Station. At 10:00 this morning, a Chinese person picked up a pistol in a pile of garbage next to Wuma Road and handed it over to the Central Police Station.

Jiangwan Gentlemen Remotely Honor the Souls of Heroes

After the January 28th battle, the Jiangwan gentry in Changgouwan, Jiangwan, collected and buried more than 1,300 bodies of war-dead soldiers and civilian victims, naming it the Tomb of Unnamed Heroes, facing the Tomb of Clothes and Hats in Miaohang from afar, which is quite admirable. Every year on the anniversary of January 28th, the Jiangwan Town Office gathers the gentry of the town and has a ritual to pay tribute. This year, due to the pressing environment, the area has long been reduced to a war zone, and the Jiangwan gentry have all taken refuge in the concessions. Therefore, at noon yesterday, a remote sacrifice was held in a certain place, the situation was tragic. In addition, a cement archway was originally built in front of the tomb, with the four characters "Bixue Zhonghun" (Loyal Souls in Scarlet Blood) inscribed on it, personally written by Chairman Lin. Since the fall of Jiangwan, the buildings such as this archway are enough to make people linger.

People from All Walks of Life Comfort Displaced Compatriots

People from all walks of life and some teachers and students of schools in the city, in view of the fact that since the War of Resistance, the displaced compatriots have been away from their homes and have suffered in their lives, especially went to the shelters yesterday to express their condolences and donated food and daily necessities, etc. Yesterday, people also visited the second and sixth International and the Cilian Association central shelters. The Refugee Relief Association, the Citizen Group Fundraising Committee, and the Shanghai International Relief Committee and other charity groups also received a lot of vegetarian and frugality donations yesterday.

Japanese Troops in Western Shanghai are Generally Fearful

According to people from Western Shanghai, the Japanese troops in Western Shanghai, recently in view of the Chinese guerrillas active in the Hongqiao Road, Zhongshan Road, Qinghu Highway and other areas, and fearing that the guerrillas will launch a large-scale operation on the anniversary of "January 28th", feel that the existing Japanese troops are very weak. Therefore, from yesterday afternoon, more than 50 Japanese soldiers along the Shanghai Middle School on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, the Chengjiaqiao and Hongqiao Airport on the Hongqiao Road, and the Qibao Town on the Caobao Road, with 20 to 30 Japanese soldiers, etc., all retreated eastward to the railway line and the area east of Zhongshan Road before 3:00 PM yesterday, which shows that the Japanese troops are generally afraid of the guerrillas.

The Situation in Pudong is Even More Tense

On the eve of the January 28th Shanghai War Commemoration, the Japanese naval and army forces in Pudong, fearing that the Chinese guerrillas would take action, imposed a de facto curfew in various places during the day the day before yesterday. The situation was very tight in the evening. All land and water traffic was cut off. On the Shangnan side, although the Shangnan train was running with reduced frequency yesterday morning, civilians stayed at home to avoid disasters, so no one took the train. Only Japanese soldiers were seen traveling back and forth on the train, completely entering a state of war. On the Shangchuan side, the Japanese army used Chuansha County and the Gaomiao area in the city as strongholds. The Shangchuan train yesterday morning was also only for Japanese soldiers to ride. Passengers disappeared and the scenery along the road was bleak. Since the area along the railway is only for the Japanese naval and marine corps to defend, because the puppet organs moved to Jiangwan, it is no longer an important place in puppet "politics", so the situation is relatively relaxed.

### Commemorating the Shanghai War of Resistance: Guerrillas in Western Shanghai Launch Operations

The Chinese guerrillas in the western suburbs of Shanghai, such as Jiyang Temple, Shihuiyao, Beixinjing, and Hongqiao, all launched operations on the 27th to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Shanghai War of Resistance and attacked the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway.

At that time, the Chinese army attacked in three routes: one route went to Xiexu Road in Southern Shanghai, surrounding and attacking the Huangjia Garden in Caohejing, one route attacked the Xin Zhuang Railway Station, destroying more than ten feet of the railway, and retreated at dawn.

### Commemorating the Shanghai War of Resistance: Guerrillas in Western Shanghai Launch Operations

Chinese Troops Attack on Three Routes; Japanese Troops Dare Not Attack

The Chinese guerrillas in the western suburbs of Shanghai, such as Jiyu Temple, Shihuiyao, Beixinjing, and Hongqiao, all launched operations on the 27th to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Shanghai War of Resistance.

### Manchuria's Door is Now Closed

Few Business Opportunities for Foreigners; Controlled Exchange Makes Purchasing Difficult

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan, owners of the American Asia Insurance Company in this port, have returned to Shanghai after traveling in Manchuria. According to them, many cities in Manchuria have many new buildings and the city situation is good, but the false prosperity subsidized by the "government" cannot be expected to last for a long time. Manchuria's "open door" has indeed been closed. Although the Japanese welcome foreigners to travel there, they only give non-Japanese people very few business opportunities. Manchuria strictly enforces exchange control, making it virtually impossible to send money out of Manchuria. Due to the restriction of foreign exchange, it is extremely difficult to purchase even a small amount of goods from overseas, because foreign exchange forms are very difficult to obtain. Most of Manchuria's import and export trade is with Germany. A member of the Shenyang Club once told Mr. Sullivan that it is very difficult to purchase goods from overseas now. Certain items in the club are deteriorating, and they have not been able to purchase supplements so far. Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan went to Manchuria from Shanghai in late December last year. When they arrived in Dalian, they spent 10 yuan to have their passports approved at the "Foreign Affairs Office" of the puppet Manchukuo. They were repeatedly inspected on the way, and many of the inspectors were White Russians. Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan went from Dalian to Shenyang to Harbin. Although they encountered several days of severe cold, they felt that this trip was quite interesting.

### Japanese Warships Seize Foreign Ships; Forcibly Sail to Qingdao

The "Haida", "Hafa", and "Yongzhen" Lose Freedom in Yanghekou

Various Companies Have Reported to the Consular Office for Serious Negotiations

Modern News reported that the Norwegian ship "Haida" of the Shanghai Subei Joint Transport Company, the "Hafa" of the Portuguese Fucheng Company, and the "Yongzhen" of the American Yongli Company, which were traveling to Funing and Hexingzhen in Subei, were loading passengers and cargo. The three ships sailed from Shanghai to Fu successively and arrived in the town the day before yesterday. While they were docking and unloading cargo, Japanese planes suddenly bombed the area. In order to avoid danger, the ships sailed to Yanghekou to escape. Unexpectedly, they were intercepted by the Japanese warships stationed at the port and searched. Bierman, the Norwegian shipowner of the "Haida", reasoned with the Japanese side, but to no avail. According to reports from the shipowners to the various companies, the three ships were forcibly seized by three Japanese warships at about 10 a.m. yesterday and sailed to Qingdao. The authorities of the various ships have reported the situation to the consular office and requested serious negotiations. It is found that in order to manipulate the navigation of the Yangtze River, the Japanese side has repeatedly refused foreign ships to sail. Now, it is illegally obstructing and detaining foreign ships sailing to various ports in the East China Sea, and arbitrarily detaining them. It is extremely contemptuous of the rights and interests of foreign merchants in China. It is heard that foreigners are discussing how to deal with it and hope that the governments of the countries concerned will take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of unfortunate events.

### Japanese Newspaper Opinion: Believes China Cannot Be Humiliated

Cannot Underestimate China's Ability to Resist the War; Chinese Nationals Have Strong and Resilient Qualities

Dalu Bao reported that the Japanese-language Dalu Xinbao's editorial yesterday (the 27th) stated that since Japan has made perfect preparations for a long-term war, it only needs to follow the predetermined direction and move towards the road to recovery and prevent the traps set by General Chiang Kai-shek on this road. Britain and the United States provided economic assistance to China at the end of last year, and recently, news of British loans to China, the attitude of the League of Nations, and the joint attitude of Britain, the United States, and France towards China should be regarded as important factors in China's War of Resistance. Japan should do its best to change the views of the third-party powers, because this view can temporarily encourage the anti-Japanese War of Resistance. At the same time, we should not underestimate China's ability to continue a long-term war, nor should we repeatedly declare that China's economy is about to collapse or that the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is weakening. We must remember that Chinese nationals have strong resilience.

### Conservation Relief Association: Continues to Pay Donations

Zhao Pin'an has been appointed as the captain of Shandong, and Xi Rungeng has been appointed as the captain of Jiangyin. Both have reported to the Fellow Townsmen Group for additional appointments.

The association is currently taking care of 1,348 refugees. Although the amount of donations received in the past few weeks has increased, funds and housing are two urgent needs.

A small number of refugees have been sent by the association to other ports where their families may have employment opportunities.

### French Consul Visits Refugee Camp

Expresses Sympathy by Shaking Hands with Refugee Children, Indicates Optimism for China's Future

Mr. Orcil, the French Consul in Shanghai, concerned about Chinese refugees, having heard that the International Relief Committee's first refugee camp on Route Massenet was well-managed, with remarkable achievements in refugee production and education, visited the camp at 10:00 AM yesterday (28th) accompanied by Mrs. Jordan. They were warmly received and thoroughly introduced to the camp by Director Pan Da, Secretary Lin Chengyi, and Father Mum, among others. Dozens of refugee children, led by the camp's junior teachers, sang vigorous Chinese and French songs to welcome them. The conductor of the singing group was a ten-year-old refugee child. Consul Orcil, witnessing the child's intelligence and liveliness, like that of a famous musician, was deeply moved and felt that China's future was very bright. He shook hands with the refugee children to congratulate them.

They also purchased educational products made by the refugee children as souvenirs. They bid farewell and left with Mrs. Jordan after 1:00 PM.

### No Need to Add New "6" Prefix Telephone Lines

Due to Increasing Disconnections for Unpaid Bills, Shanghai Telephone Company No Longer Needs To Implement Expansion

The Shanghai Telephone Company, to adapt to environmental needs, had planned to add new lines with a six-digit prefix. It is now learned that with the Lunar New Year approaching and under the abnormal development of various businesses, many shops are closing down. The number of disconnections for unpaid telephone bills is highest in the central district. The number of vacant telephone numbers is increasing daily, so the addition of six-digit numbers is no longer urgently needed and seems unnecessary.

### News of Wu Peifu Taking a Puppet Position is Purely Fabricated by the Japanese

Instructed a Certain Chinese to Lobby a News Agency, Domei News Agency Also Exclusively Distributed the News

The English-language Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that recent rumors of Wu Peifu preparing to take a puppet position are rampant. It has now been discovered (28th) that this was actually directed by propagandists. It is understood that any news of Wu from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beiping, or elsewhere directly originates from those directing the propaganda. One prominent example is that on Thursday (26th) afternoon, a certain Chinese visited a news agency in this city. This person was clearly

funded and instructed by the Japanese

He presented a "news" item from "News" in Beiping, stating that Chinese businessmen had telegraphed Wu Peifu, urging him to take the helm of a puppet government to "establish peace and order" in China. The Chinese person said that if the news agency issued this news under its name, he was willing to pay one hundred yuan. Although the news agency refused, a certain English-language morning newspaper in this city actually published it with a local dateline, and even

exaggerated the report,

making it sound absolutely certain. What kind of conditions led the newspaper to do this are unknown. The Domei News Agency widely distributed "important news" about Wu Peifu, but in reality, only the Domei News Agency exclusively issued this news. Other news agencies have not paid attention to it so far. According to a special dispatch from Hong Kong, Japanese sources in that area widely promoted Wu Peifu's taking a puppet position, but other parties have neither obtained this news nor paid attention to it. Furthermore, according to today's Domei News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, the "Chairman" of the puppet "Reform Government" stated that Wu will head the "Pacification Committee" supported by the Japanese.

### World Red Swastika Society's Relief Work in South China

Shelters Over a Thousand Refugees, Conducts Emergency Relief on Nanao Island

The Shanghai headquarters of the World Red Swastika Society has now received a report from its Hong Kong office stating that since the Guangzhou Incident,

tens of thousands of refugees have gathered

in the area near Hong Kong, sleeping in the open and exposed to the elements, without clothes or food. Their miserable state is unbearable to witness. Emergency relief has been repeatedly conducted, and efforts have been made to assist them in returning home. Reception centers have been established in Yuen Long and Shenzhen, sheltering 1,082 refugees, divided into male and female sections. The facilities include rooms, beds, a dining hall, a school, a reading room, a sports ground, and a clinic. The director of the center, Cai Baotian, is planning to build new buildings in the nearby wilderness to expand the capacity. Furthermore, the relief team sent by the society to Shantou has handled two emergency fire reliefs in the area in the past two months and has departed for Nanao Island to conduct emergency relief. The island is isolated at sea and has suffered repeated disasters. The people are starving and freezing, which is extremely pitiful. Upon receiving the report, the headquarters has collected 1,600 sets of cotton clothing and 1,000 cotton quilts and transported them to Hong Kong for distribution to the reception centers for relief.

### Revised Navigation Regulations for the Zhejiang East Coast, Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Route Realized

Jardine Matheson's Moufuku and Butterfield & Swire's Liangzhou are both scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Ningbo today. Details as follows:

Key points are recorded below: (Article 1) To restrict the free movement of various vessels in the various seaports in eastern Zhejiang (such as the Ou River Estuary, Jiang, Jiao River, Feiyun River, Qing River Estuary, Chudu, Yong River, Sanmen Bay, Hangzhou Bay, Xiangshan Port, and various rivers on the south bank of the Qiantang River (such as the Fuchun River, Cao'e River, Puyang River)), these regulations are specifically established. (Article 2) All types of vessels traveling to the various seaports and river mouths mentioned in Article 1 shall comply with the provisions of these regulations. (Article 3) All steamships traveling to the various seaports mentioned in Article 1 must first have their quality inspected by the Wenzhou and Ningbo Shipping Administration Offices directly under the Ministry of Transportation to determine their seaworthiness, obtain a certificate, obtain guarantees from at least two reputable shops in the local area, and register the ship's name, tonnage, route, and duration of travel with the relevant garrison command. The garrison command will then submit the information to the Tenth Group Army Headquarters and the Zhejiang Provincial Government (hereinafter referred to as the Ministry and Government) for joint approval and issuance of a pass before sailing is permitted. Regardless of the port to which the steamship is sailing, the sailing time must be more than one year before approval can be granted; otherwise, sailing is prohibited to indicate restriction. The registration method shall be formulated by each garrison command and submitted to the Ministry and Government for approval and implementation. Steamships that have been approved for navigation in the preceding paragraph must submit a verification certificate and apply to the Wenzhou or Ningbo Shipping Administration Office for re-inspection and measurement within two months of sailing to obtain a certificate before continuing to sail to prevent unscrupulous shipowners from competing and to ensure navigation safety. (Article 4) Foreign vessels applying for a pass to navigate to various ports must strictly comply with Chinese laws and be measured by the Shipping Administration Office in the same way as national vessels. (Article 5) Passenger ticket and freight prices of each steamship must be fair and approved by the various shipping associations and submitted to the garrison command for transmittal to the Ministry and Government for approval and uniform compliance. They must not be raised or lowered at will for competition. (Article 6) (Omitted) (Article 7) Steamships traveling to the various seaports mentioned in Article 1 shall be subject to the following restrictions regarding the loading of passengers and goods (the restrictions are the same as the previously issued regulations, omitted). (Article 8) (Article 9) (Article 10) All (omitted). (Article 11) When each garrison commander directly receives an order from the Military Affairs Commission or the commander-in-chief's office or the Zhejiang Provincial Government ordering the approval of goods or ships for import and export, it must be reported to this headquarters for record. (Article 12) Steamships and sailing ships traveling to various seaports and river mouths that violate the provisions of Articles 3, 4, and 6 of these regulations by sailing without authorization or fail to comply with the restrictions of Articles 7 to 10 shall be detained by the local competent authority or troops, and the circumstances of the violation shall be reported to this headquarters for verification and handling. However, those who load contraband (permitted to be enemy goods) or have communication with the enemy shall have their ships, people, and goods detained and reported to this headquarters for investigation and punishment. (Article 13) If it is deemed that certain types or a certain type of vessel should be prohibited or restricted from navigating to certain ports of entry and exit during certain periods, the commander-in-chief, the highest commander of the provincial defense army, or the provincial military and political department, or the stationed troops must comply and notify the Shipping Administration Office. The same applies when opening. (Article 14) Inspection agencies must be established for all ships entering and exiting the various rivers and seas mentioned in Article 1 to be responsible for thorough inspections. The relevant garrison command or the highest commander of the local defense army (at locations where no garrison command is established) shall verify the local situation and preside over the convening of the relevant agencies to jointly dispatch personnel to organize a (location) Customs Inspection Post, subordinate to the relevant garrison command or the highest commander of the defense army. All officers and soldiers of the inspection post shall be concurrently appointed by the various agencies without additional expenses, but a small amount of office expenses may be granted at discretion.

(Article 16) These regulations shall be implemented after being approved by the commander of the war zone and submitted for approval.

Direct Navigation Between Shanghai and Ningbo Permitted

Regarding Shanghai-Ningbo direct navigation steamships, after the authorities ordered a ban on sailing, various parties repeatedly requested permission without success. Although the Moufuku and other special cargo ships were subsequently allowed to sail to Ningbo, they had to go through Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Wenwan, and were still not allowed to sail directly, which was still inconvenient for passenger and cargo transport between Shanghai and Ningbo. After the Ningbo Fellow Association and others presented their reasons and requested resumption, the ×th Group Army convened a shipping conference and passed a new navigation regulation, which no longer prohibits direct navigation to Shanghai and has been submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval. In order to comply with public opinion, the headquarters has already implemented it first, but ordered shipping companies to comply with the regulations and complete registration, measurement, and verification procedures. It is learned that Jardine Matheson's Moufuku and Butterfield & Swire's Liangzhou are both scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Ningbo today. Direct Shanghai-Ningbo navigation, which has been brewing for a long time, has finally been realized from today.

Shanghai Special Edition

### On the Exchange and Transfer System

— Huang Yuzhai

The Wrap-Around Discount of Exchange and Transfer

I. Introduction

The promulgation of China's Negotiable Instruments Law has only occurred in the last ten years. Due to inherited habits and preconceived notions, most of us lack a clear understanding of negotiable instruments, or even harbor doubts and distrust regarding them. Therefore, the application of negotiable instruments in the commercial arena has not yet become widespread. In fact, the evolution of transactions from barter to credit media, from goods and silks to coinage and paper money, is a regular progression. Negotiable instruments are a product of the expansion of paper money credit, and it is only natural to use them as a medium of exchange in place of paper money. In Western countries, negotiable instruments are almost regarded as a necessary tool for transactions, because coinage may sometimes be exhausted, while negotiable instruments can be used freely. With the development of the discount business, turnover is facilitated, and the prosperity of industry and commerce depends on it. China's industry and commerce are backward, and the currency system is chaotic. Government officials are determined to plan for revival, and the currency system reform of November 4, 1935, has been implemented for three years, with remarkable results. However, the application of negotiable instruments has not yet become widespread due to adherence to customs. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the government has launched a full-scale war of resistance, and economic mobilization is an urgent task. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance announced measures to stabilize finance during the emergency period and implemented restrictions on withdrawals and deposits. The local silver and money industry has further formulated supplementary measures in accordance with these measures and submitted them to the Ministry for approval. In addition to the withdrawal and deposit restrictions, payments can be made through inter-bank exchange and transfer, and inter-bank exchange and transfer are limited to commercial payments. Therefore, in the Shanghai market, there are exchange and transfer instruments that can be cashed every other day, becoming exchange and transfer instruments that are not cashed. The industrial and commercial sectors are constrained by the environment and have no choice but to use exchange and transfer as a bargaining chip in transactions. With the widespread use of negotiable instruments, the financial sector has also produced some special phenomena. As we approach New Year's Day, this newspaper is publishing a special economic issue and requesting an article from me. I would like to discuss this topic in depth.

II. Exchange and Transfer Discounts and Speculative Manipulation

Exchange and transfer instruments are a special product of the wartime financial measures in this city. At the beginning of their implementation, there may have been considerable inconvenience. Fortunately, the industrial and commercial sectors have understood the government's painstaking efforts and unanimously supported them. The fact that the financial situation in this city after the war was as stable as a rock and unusually stable was not without reason. The contribution of exchange and transfer instruments to wartime finance is also obvious. However, due to the need for cash in the use of funds in various sectors, it is necessary to exchange cash from the silver and money industry through discount means. Therefore, new institutions specializing in exchange and transfer discounts in the market have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. However, this type of discount, called a discount in the industry, is the same in name but different in reality. According to the general definition of discount in ordinary banking, it is generally explained as the business of a bank calculating the interest between the date of payment and the arrival of the payment date for periodically payable negotiable instruments or securities at a certain interest rate and deducting it from the amount stated on the negotiable instruments or securities, and buying its negotiable instruments or securities at the remaining price. The discount of exchange and transfer instruments is the business of a bank calculating the discount that should be paid for exchange and transfer instruments that cannot be cashed during the emergency period at a certain discount rate and deducting it from the amount stated on the negotiable instruments, and buying its negotiable instruments. This new business had no precedent or established rules at the beginning, and there was a lack of management and control organizations. Therefore, speculators inevitably manipulated it from the middle to seek profit. The industry also competed with each other and kept secrets. The market was not unified, and news was lacking. Deceit and fraud were endless, causing losses to both buyers and sellers.

According to the annual exchange and transfer discount rate, the rise and fall are not necessarily fixed. At the end of last year, the initial rate was as high as over forty per thousand. Later, the situation eased slightly, and it fell to around twenty per thousand. Since the spring and summer of this year, the discount has risen sharply. When Xuzhou fell, it once rose to a peak of seventy-eight yuan per thousand. Fortunately, it soon recovered slightly and hovered between fifty and sixty yuan per thousand. When Hankou and Guangzhou fell one after another, the discount rose again, reaching seventy-one or seventy-two yuan per thousand. During the chaotic market conditions, speculators could manipulate and profit, while the industrial and commercial sectors needed cash, and discounts were not available, resulting in many hidden losses. Recently, large loans from the United States and Britain have been successful. At the same time, the future of the war situation has entered a new stage. People's psychology is stable, and the financial foundation is consolidated. This discount rate has plummeted, once falling to around thirty-seven thousandths, and is currently hovering between forty-two and forty-three, which is a great phenomenon. (To be continued)

### Southwest Returning Guest Describes Travel Impressions

The People of Guizhou Province Possess Extremely Strong Self-Defense Strength, Wang Jingwei Appears in Hanoi on New Year's Day

"Special Interview with This Newspaper" In recent times, the construction and transportation in the southwestern provinces have been developing rapidly. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed Mr. So-and-so, who had just returned from Guilin yesterday. According to his description, his observations along the way were very detailed. The key points are recorded as follows:

When departing from Guilin, although Guilin had been bombed by Japanese aircraft several times, the situation there was still very quiet. The first night was spent in Liuzhou. The people in Liuzhou are simple and hardworking. Most of the villages are thatched cottages, but the productivity is very high. The next day, we traveled from Liuzhou to Nanning, which is the former capital of Guangxi Province and is more prosperous. The people also live in tiled houses. The green hills and clear waters are similar to those of Jiangnan. Hotels are priced in Guizhou currency, which is worth half of the national currency. Therefore, a room that costs three or four yuan only costs two yuan in national currency. The next day, we traveled from Nanning to Longzhou, where a supervisory office is set up to handle the issuance of passports for leaving the country. Those traveling from the mainland through Annam must complete this procedure and find a local shopkeeper to guarantee them before a passport can be issued. Near Longzhou is Yazi Shoal, the most dangerous place on the highway in the province. The highway surrounds the top of the mountain. Looking down from the highway, one sees Yazi Shoal, which is thousands of feet deep. A slight carelessness will lead to a fall. The gentleman saw three or four overturned vehicles at this location, probably because the traffic is heavy and accidents are unavoidable.

From Longzhou to Zhennan Pass, we still took a car. Zhennan Pass has a glorious history in the Sino-French War of Liu Yongfu. The terrain of the pass is quite dangerous, but its scale is smaller than that of Juyong Pass. Leaving Zhennan Pass, we entered Annam. The common languages ​​there are Annamese and French. The situation in the countryside is like that in mainland China. That night, we stayed in Dongdang. From Dongdang to Hanoi, there is a railway that can be reached from morning to evening. From Hanoi to Haiphong, the railway is smooth. At Haiphong, there are ships that go directly to Shanghai, and some stop in Hong Kong, which is very convenient. The gentleman also said that there are branches of the China Travel Service in all the places he passed, which is of great help to travelers. The gentleman deeply felt that such a long journey, passing through various places, often staying for several days to investigate local customs, education, construction, and other matters, does not cost much. Regarding the general situation in mainland China, he believes that there is more than enough manpower and material resources. The southwest is indeed China's real treasure, which is not false.

The highway transportation in Guizhou Province is generally open and ready. Almost every place in the province can be reached directly by car. The self-defense strength of the people is very strong. Because of the years of improvement in the province's administrative facilities, agricultural production is quite abundant. Since the completion of the Xianggui Railway, transportation between the province and the mainland has been very convenient. Recently, the Zhennan section of the railway has been extended, from Nanning to Zhennan Pass. It is now gradually nearing completion and will be open to traffic soon. In the future, it will be connected to the Vietnamese railway. This kind of rapid progress in construction will surely bring comfort to the people of the country. In the future, the route between Hanoi and Guilin will be one of the two major routes in southwestern China, along with the route between Hanoi and Kunming.

The gentleman learned about Wang Jingwei's sudden departure from Chongqing and trip to Annam on the way. According to reports, Wang did not have a passport when he first left Chongqing and arrived in Vietnam, so he felt quite embarrassed. Later, he stayed in Liangshan for many days. On New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, he and his entourage appeared in the city of Hanoi, but they were also very cautious. According to what the gentleman heard, the rumor that Wang was staying in a village dozens of miles away from Hanoi was probably a deliberate statement by his subordinates to avoid attention. The environment and scenery of Hanoi are indeed very clear and elegant. The traffic there is very busy recently due to the congestion of passenger and freight transport. When the gentleman was traveling by boat from Haiphong through Guangzhou Bay and Beihai, Japanese planes dropped bombs almost every day. The gentleman landed at Xiying and visited the Chikan area, which is also a gathering place for merchants and very lively.

### William Hunt & Co.'s Two Warehouses in Pudong Are Refused to Be Returned by the Japanese

Nissin Company Took Over the Warehouses Yesterday, Future Negotiations Between the US and Japan Are Worth Watching

William Hunt & Co., an American company, legally should have received the former China Merchants Bureau's four warehouses in Pudong and Hongkou. Recently, it has been learned that the Japanese side disregarded everything. In addition to the two warehouses in Hongkou, which are still used for military purposes, the two warehouses in Pudong were actually handed over to the Japanese Nissin Company for business. What kind of development this international dispute between the United States and Japan will cause in the future is worth watching. The details are recorded as follows:

Four Warehouses Occupied After the War

The state-owned China Merchants Bureau of Shanghai transferred all its property rights to William Hunt & Co., an American company, for operation after the outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai War two years ago. The first step was to take over the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession, which has now been renamed Roosevelt Wharf, and resume business. After the war, most of the wharves of Chinese and foreign merchants upstream and downstream of the Huangpu River have not resumed business due to the situation. Therefore, the business of Roosevelt Wharf is quite developed. However, in addition to Jinliyuan Wharf, the China Merchants Bureau of Shanghai also has the new warehouse in Yangjiadu, Pudong, as well as the Chinese warehouse of Qichang Warehouse, and the Zhong Warehouse and North Warehouse in Hongkou. Because these four locations were in the war zone, they were not taken over during the war and were occupied by the Japanese army after the war and have not been returned.

The Japanese Side Refused to Return Them

William Hunt & Co. believes that the purchase of the China Merchants Bureau of Shanghai went through legal procedures with the Ministry of Transportation of the National Government of China and was confirmed by the American Consular Court, obtaining legal property rights. Therefore, it has repeatedly requested the diplomatic authorities of the country to negotiate with the Japanese side according to law, but the request has not been granted on the grounds of military relations. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese army suddenly evacuated the occupied Pei Dongxin Warehouse and Hua Warehouse, and it was rumored that the negotiations between the United States and Japan had a hope of resolution. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side had other plans for this move. It was not until recently that the truth was revealed, that it was planned to hand over the two warehouses to the Japanese Nissin Company for business.

Nissin Took Over Two Warehouses

Yesterday, Nissin Company suddenly sent 24 employees to Yangjiadu Warehouse and Gongchang Warehouse Hua Warehouse to take over the warehouses at the same time, stationing guards in the warehouses. It is also heard that after a short period of reorganization, it is planned to resume the business of the two warehouses. According to internal sources, although the Japanese side is superficially handing over the management to Nissin Company temporarily, Nissin Company is a purely commercial organization and is suspected of infringing on the commerce of other countries. It is also heard that the Zhong Warehouse and North Warehouse in Hongkou will soon be occupied by Nissin Company. However, William Hunt & Co. has not yet heard of any negotiations on this matter. Future disputes are likely to attract attention from China and abroad.

### German Shipping Vessels Stop at Zhangjiagang

Since the Japanese side controls the inner harbor and occupies various small ports in the Yangtze River, the business of various foreign shipping companies has been greatly affected. In particular, Zhangjiagang in Jiangyin has been blockaded for nearly three months, and passengers and goods have to go through other ports, which is even more inconvenient. Now, the German company Hanvon Trading Company is planning to resume the Zhangjiagang flights and set up a transportation department. The Luan and Haikang vessels will stop there, starting on the first of next month. Small vessels from Wuxi and Changzhou can still arrive directly, making passenger and cargo transportation more convenient than before.

### Confirmation of Kidnapping Case on Avenue Haig: Zhao Lianchi Abducted

Previous Rumors of Shao Lizi Being a Phonetic Misunderstanding; Foreign Newspaper Reports Link to Transportation Matters

News of a kidnapping case that occurred on Avenue Haig a few days ago could not be confirmed immediately by the police at the time due to a lack of supporting evidence. Foreign newspapers reported that the person rumored to be kidnapped was Shao Lizi, but even they could not confirm the identity of the person. Subsequently, Chinese newspapers, citing Chongqing telegrams, stated that Shao Lizi was currently residing safely in Chongqing, which sufficiently proved that the rumors of Shao being kidnapped were completely false. Yesterday, this reporter conducted further investigations and learned that the person kidnapped in this case was Zhao Lianchi, a merchant from Wuxing. It is understood that there may have been a misunderstanding due to the similarity in the phonetic sounds of the names. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:

Sudden Arrival of Cars

Around 10:45 AM on the 26th, several black cars suddenly drove to the intersection of Avenue Haig and Dahua Road in the Public Concession and stopped at the entrance of Alley 1004. Many Japanese and Chinese individuals stepped out of the cars one after another and entered the alley, heading directly to No. 3. They pushed open the back door and went upstairs. Two Chinese men remained downstairs to guard the entrance and the staircase. The remaining four Japanese and Chinese individuals went upstairs and entered the room.

Seeking Refuge in Shanghai

The resident of the upper floor living room was Zhao Lianchi, a man from Wuxing, named Zhen, 43 years old. His wife's name was Shen Guiying. His eldest daughter, Ling'e, was 13 years old. His son, Kewei (nicknamed Shunsheng), was currently studying at the nearby Liben Primary School. His elder brother, Liancheng, also resided there. When Zhao was in his hometown, he worked at the Shen Ji Wool Shop in Luduqiao, Wuxing, for many years. His elder brother, Liancheng, worked at the Desheng Wool Shop. After the fall of Wuxing, Zhao led his family to seek refuge in the Xinzhi Town area of western Zhejiang and eventually came to Shanghai. They had just moved into the front building of No. 3, Alley 1004, Avenue Haig, two or three months ago. Subsequently, he had some interactions with colleagues in the wool industry in Shanghai.

Forcibly Taken into a Car

On the morning of the 26th, his elder brother, Liancheng, had gone to a tea house to chat with friends. Zhao Lianchi was still in bed, not yet awake. Suddenly, unexpected guests came upstairs. His wife was busy working and did not pay attention to the visitors. The visitors entered Zhao's bedroom, took out a pistol, and ordered him to remain silent. They then took Zhao Lianchi downstairs, out of the alley, and drove away quickly in the original car, disappearing without a trace. It is rumored that the kidnapped person is currently being held in Hongkou. However, due to the lack of detailed information, his exact whereabouts remain unclear.

Ambiguous Case Details

According to the reporter's investigation at the location yesterday, the sub-landlord of No. 2 was a Mr. Wu. The furnishings in Zhao's residence were simple and extremely cramped. After Zhao was taken away, the concierge police officer saw Zhao being driven away in a car with others, but did not know that he had been kidnapped. It was not until the police sent investigators to investigate that they learned the truth. The reason for the kidnapping is currently under investigation by the police. According to his elder brother, Liancheng, they had come to Shanghai to seek refuge because they could not live peacefully in their hometown and he was also unaware of the details of the case.

Reported by Foreign Newspapers

The North-China Daily News reported that a Chinese man named Zhao Lianchi, who was engaged in the transportation business in Shanghai, was taken away by the Japanese on Thursday morning (the 26th). Yesterday (the 27th), the Japanese military authorities inquired about Zhao at the "New Shanghai Hotel" (formerly the Deutches Heim Apartments). It was heard that Zhao lived in an alley opposite Dahua Road on Avenue Haig. On Thursday morning, he was arrested at his residence by two Japanese men and ten Chinese men. It is generally believed that the Japanese did not report this action to the Public Concession Police or carry it out in conjunction with the police. As of last night, the Japanese side had not reported the reason for Zhao's detention to the Public Concession authorities. However, it is generally believed to be related to transportation matters. Until late at night, all efforts to secure Zhao's release had no effect.

### Prevailing Colds and Coughs: A Gift of Rapidly Changing Weather; "Wee Lings" Effective Medicine

Colds and coughs are very common ailments among the Chinese people, especially during periods of rapidly changing weather. Because they usually do not pose an immediate threat to life, everyone considers them minor illnesses that are allowed to heal on their own. In reality, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Various acute infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, often start from ordinary colds and coughs. Consumption, a pulmonary disease, almost always begins with a cough, with the danger being unimaginable. Even if it develops into chronic bronchitis, becoming an elderly cough, asthma with phlegm, the suffering is unspeakable. Therefore, Westerners regard colds and coughs as venomous snakes and beasts. As soon as they start, they are treated immediately for a speedy recovery. Among common medicines, white pine syrup is a natural remedy for coughs. Blue and white pines are abundant in northern Europe. Europeans suffering from lung disease often sit and lie in white pine forests, inhaling their aromatic air, which has remarkable effects. Therefore, it is made into syrup and exported to foreign countries to benefit fellow sufferers. However, pure white pine syrup is not very effective. Wee Ling Pharmacy, especially tailored to the constitution of the Chinese people, combines it with auxiliary ingredients to make a compound white pine syrup that resolves phlegm, relieves coughs, calms spasms, and relieves asthma. It is fragrant and palatable, suitable for both the old and the young. Compared to pure white pine syrup, its effect is many times greater. Those suffering from colds and coughs should not hesitate to quickly purchase Wee Ling Compound White Pine Syrup. The price is one dollar per bottle, with a special price of 75 cents. It is sold at the Zheng Wei Pharmacy at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Second Road. Telephone number 92525. Purchases do not include delivery fees.

### Shanghai Opera Actress Wang Caiying Sues for Dissolution of Engagement

Defendant Appears in Court for a One-Sided Debate; Awaiting Judgment; Plaintiff Mistakenly Believes the Court Intends to Reopen the Debate

Wang Caiying, also known as Wang Miaojin, a woman from Anhui who used to perform Shanghai opera at the Tianyun Lou Amusement Park on the rooftop of the Wing On Company, is 28 years old and currently resides at No. 13 Yixing Lane, Qipu Road, Public Concession. Recently, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court's Civil Division against her fiancé, Wu Xianglin, from Ningbo (30 years old, residing at Kangfa Western Tailor Shop, opposite the Empire Cinema on Avenue Joffre, French Concession), seeking a

Dissolution of Engagement

Her complaint stated that the defendant met the plaintiff in the summer of the 25th year of the Republic of China. He claimed to be an inspector at the Jianghai Customs, boasting about his prosperous income and solid family background. He said that he had recently suffered the sorrow of losing his wife, so he often went out to relieve his boredom, hoping to find a suitable partner in a crowded place to complete the marriage mirror. When he saw the plaintiff, he was amazed by her beauty and was extremely attentive, expressing regret for not meeting her sooner. He pursued her relentlessly and was eventually

Deceived by Sweet Words

She was deceived by his tricks and became engaged to him. Fortunately, they agreed to hold the wedding within a year in the 26th year of the Republic of China. Unexpectedly, after the engagement, in less than two months, the defendant changed his attitude. First, he claimed that being a customs inspector was too tiring and he wanted to switch to a job on a ship, demanding that the plaintiff provide him with a 500 tael guarantee, which was not agreed to. He then scolded the plaintiff for being heartless, threatening and insulting her at will. The plaintiff was surprised to see this. Then, he took advantage of the situation and secretly stole the plaintiff's diamond ring. After the plaintiff and her brothers

Intervened

His brother was responsible for returning it. Taking advantage of the plaintiff's absence when she went to Hangzhou to offer incense, he also falsely claimed that the plaintiff had entrusted him to repair a wireless radio, and swindled a six-tube wireless radio worth 200 yuan from the maid. The defendant is so irresponsible and uses such sinister methods that it is difficult to describe them all. As time goes on, it will be unbearable to continue like this. Therefore, she is

Forced

To request that the court grant a judgment to dissolve the engagement. The court, based on the complaint, opened the Civil Court Seven trial yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Wu Xiaoke. The plaintiff did not appear. The defendant appeared in court alone and requested a one-sided debate. He claimed that the plaintiff had scheduled to marry him in the 26th year of the Republic of China. He excused himself that he had bad habits. In the 27th year, he used the war as an excuse for a repeated postponement of the wedding. It was actually the plaintiff's fault. He did not want to dissolve the engagement and

Requested Dismissal

Of the plaintiff's lawsuit. After reviewing the situation, the court granted the defendant's request, held a one-sided debate, and announced the conclusion of the trial, scheduling the judgment for February 2nd. The plaintiff in this case received the court summons on the noon of the 27th. Because the summons did not specify that the party should appear in court, the plaintiff went to the court yesterday without knowing which court the case was being heard in. She waited quietly in the Fourth Court

In the courtroom and waited.

She waited in the fourth courtroom of the second special court

Until the judge of the fourth court finished the trial and left the court. The court clerk saw the plaintiff, Wang Caiying, still sitting quietly in the audience seat and asked what case she was waiting for. Only then did she realize her mistake and went to wait in the seventh court, but the case had already adjourned. Therefore, she went back disappointed. It is heard that the plaintiff intends to file another request with the court to reopen the debate.

### Unwilling to Sell Laughter: Jumping Out of the Fiery Pit

Filing a Lawsuit to Terminate Adoption; Adoptive Father Sues the Pimp

The young woman Zhiyun originally belonged to a modest family. Her mother, Chen Ma, gave her to Zhou Quanfu as an adopted daughter. Zhou sent her to a brothel to learn opera. A man named Wang Chengzhi, who liked to indulge in licentious pleasures, met Zhiyun in the brothel. He fell in love with her at first sight, and they eventually became inseparable. However, Zhiyun was restricted and had no freedom. She initially used the excuse of seeking medical treatment and disappeared like a yellow crane. After escaping her prison, she wrote a letter to Zhou, saying that she was unwilling to continue a life of selling laughter and that she was severing all relations and regaining her freedom. She also filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Zhou to terminate the adoption. The court summoned the parties for questioning the day before yesterday and scheduled the judgment for the 30th of this month. However, Zhou believed that Wang Chengzhi was largely responsible for Zhiyun's departure from the family and her subsequent actions. Therefore, he filed a criminal lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Wang for obstructing the family, requesting that he be summoned for interrogation and punishment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui reopened the trial, but the defendant still did not surrender. Zhiyun was also requested by the plaintiff to be summoned for cross-examination, but she also did not appear. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, Shi Jiutang, in court, the defendant was said to be working in the pseudo-organization "Jiangsu Provincial Government" and his residence was now in the French Concession. Since the plaintiff filed the lawsuit, the defendant had tried to use threats to negotiate a settlement. After Judge Liu briefly questioned the plaintiff, he ordered the trial to be postponed and ordered the defendant to be summoned for interrogation and verification.

### German Merchant Ship "Heinrich Jessen" Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Robbed at Zhanghuanggeng

2,300 Yuan in Cash Stolen; Passengers, Crew, and Cargo Fortunately Unharmed

The German Far East Shipping Company's "Heinrich Jessen" sails to Xinsheng Port, Zhanghuanggeng, Xinniu Port, Changyinsha, Dongjiegeng, No. 10 Port, and Hupukou, among other places. This time, the ship was carrying grain, cotton, and passengers from Changyinsha to Shanghai. Around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, while sailing on the river near Zhanghuanggeng, it was boarded by pirates with guns on small boats, and all the revenue from the accounts room, passenger fares, and cash carried by passengers were looted by the pirates. Later, the pirates escaped on the small boats. After the pirates left, the ship sailed to Shanghai as usual, arriving safely in Shanghai at 5:10 PM yesterday and docking at Pier No. 4 on the Bund of the Public Concession. According to the crew of the ship, they were robbed by pirates near Zhanghuanggeng at 1:00 AM on the 28th while sailing from Changyinsha to Shanghai. The total amount of cash stolen was 2,300 yuan. Fortunately, the cargo, passengers, and crew were all unharmed. The ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 6:00 AM on the 29th, following its original route as usual.

### Rental Ship Dispute: The Issue of Flag Flying Deserves Special Attention

The Case is Complex and Requires Further Investigation; The Court Ordered a Postponement for Further Hearing

Cao Hongyi, the manager of the Yitai Shipping Company, subleased a ship that his company had previously leased from the Minnan Shipping Company, the "Minhang" later renamed "Wanna," flying the Italian flag, and two luggers to the Hankou Shipping Company, established by Luo Wanxiang, the owner of the Dagong Customs Brokerage, for a monthly rent of 11,700 yuan in legal tender. They stipulated a route along the Yangtze River ports. The navigation permit was obtained from the Japanese military by Shi Guangchang, a native of Suzhou and the manager of the Hankou Company, who entrusted the Tianli Shipping Company, jointly owned by Chinese and Japanese shipping merchants. After

Some Disputes Arose

After giving a portion of the rent, Cao, Shi, Wu Chaohua, the former manager of Yitai and a native of Anhui, and Ma Chengbeng, the owner of the Yuantai Xiang Paper Shop on Avenue du Roi Albert, from Ningbo, who guaranteed the Hankou Company with a newly carved seal, and Huang Zhichu, a shipping comprador, were accused by Luo of colluding to defraud 7,000 yuan in cash and 6,700 yuan in checks. The case was reported to the French Concession police, who had already arrested Cao and others and sent them to the First Special District Court. Details of the interrogations have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after Luo Wanxiang,

Accused Cao Hongyi

Of defrauding 4,000 yuan, Zhu Yousong, the mastermind of the Dade Shipping Company. Although their ship rental dispute occurred after the Luo case, it had been settled out of court. The contract between Yitai and Dade to lease the "Wanna" was canceled, and the 4,000 yuan rent was returned, putting an end to the matter. Later, Zhu saw the news reports about Cao and others being sued for fraud and believed that what they had encountered was the same. He decided to join the case, hoping to punish them together. This afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing continued the trial, with both defendants and important witness Mr. Canningham of the Tianli Company

Present for Questioning

According to Mr. Canningham's testimony, Tianli was jointly founded by Chinese and Japanese shipping merchants, and Shi Guangchang was also one of the partners. The Hankou Company wanted to join Tianli after renting the "Wanna" from Yitai, so Shi especially entrusted Tianli to obtain a navigation permit from the Japanese military. Shi had met with Luo Wanxiang and me many times. The court then questioned Shi Guangchang, who testified that he had severed ties with Tianli on November 15th. This time, he entrusted Tianli to obtain the navigation permit, originally intending to pay a handling fee of 5,000 yuan once it was obtained, and another two or three percent of the ship's operating

Surplus

To be paid as compensation. Regarding the issue of flag flying while the ship was sailing, Luo Wanxiang told me that there was no need to fly a flag after entering the Jiangyin blockade line because they had a permit and could pass through. Cao Hongyi's defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, then raised the point that, under the current situation on the Yangtze River, ships must either fly the Japanese flag or the five-color puppet flag, and asked the court to ask Shi and Luo if this was the case. Luo Wanxiang and Shi gave vague answers to these two points. Then, Cao's side presented the "Wanna" shipowner, surnamed Xi, to prove that Cao had handed the ship over to Shi Guangchang and that ships currently sailing on the Yangtze River

Must Fly the Japanese Flag

According to Xi's testimony, the "Wanna" returned to Shanghai from Haimen on December 5th, when Cao notified him to stop sailing because the ship had been rented to the Hankou Company and would be sailing on the Yangtze River. This shipping route is absolutely not allowed to sail unless it is a Japanese ship flying the Japanese flag. Therefore, my diary has a record of the rental to Nikko. In the afternoon, Cao and Shi boarded the ship together, and Cao introduced me to Shi. Because I was unwilling to work for the new owner, I automatically resigned that evening and left the ship. Cao Hongyi then continued to testify that, according to the rental agreement,

The Rent Must Be Paid in Full

Before the ship was handed over. Because of Shi's and Chen Defu of the Gongda Shipping Company’s repeated requests, the 6,700 yuan check would definitely be cashed at noon on the 6th, so he led Shi onto the ship for handover at 1:00 PM that afternoon, with no other procedures. Zhu Yousong, another plaintiff, also described the ship rental dispute between Dade and Cao. However, I thought they were renting the ship to fly the Japanese flag, but Lawyer Jiang presented a letter from Dade to Yitai, providing a strong rebuttal to Zhu's testimony. The court believed that further investigation was still needed and postponed the trial for another hearing.

### Fire in Western Shanghai: Detailed Record of the Disaster

Approximately 1,000 Homeless; Fires Also Reported in Zhabei and Hongkou

Yesterday morning (the 28th), a fire broke out in the cluster of shanties in the area of the Western Shanghai extra-settlement roads, one-quarter of a mile from St. John's University, leaving approximately 1,000 people homeless. Fortunately, the prompt work of the Public Concession firefighters prevented the fire from spreading to adjacent buildings. The lookout at the Jing'an Temple Road Fire Brigade immediately notified the fire trucks to dispatch when they saw the fire. After a considerable amount of time, the brigade received an alarm call. The first three fire trucks were dispatched at 12:48 AM. A few minutes later, other fire trucks from the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade and the Yichang Road Fire Brigade were also called out. Two fire trucks from the Caojiadu Fire Brigade also dispatched and rushed to the scene of the fire. Fortunately, the water supply was sufficient and the firefighters were able to spray water around the burning shanties, so they were able to control the fire in about half an hour. After another 45 minutes, it was completely extinguished. At almost the same time as the fire in Western Shanghai, a fire also broke out at a cotton warehouse at No. 152 Ouhua Lane (all transliterations), Yuyang Road, Zhabei. The Hongkou Fire Brigade received a report at 12:41 AM and immediately dispatched fire trucks. However, the fire was already very fierce and took about 90 minutes to extinguish. The cotton warehouse was a two-story building containing a large amount of waste cotton, which was extensively damaged. However, there were no casualties. A rayon factory at No. 63 Huade Road also caught fire this morning. A machine was slightly damaged. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade dispatched fire trucks to the scene at 4:27 AM. The fire had already been extinguished by the factory workers.

### New New Company: 14th Anniversary

Taking children to visit can truly inspire the wisdom of young people.

### Four Bandits Escape from the French Concession: Two "Puppet Police" Reprimanded

Two of the Four Bandits are Gang Leaders; The Remaining Five Bandits are Still in Japanese Hands

The Continental Times reported that yesterday afternoon (the 27th), it was learned from responsible sources that four bandits who were detained in the Japanese Gendarmerie Department on Route Ghisi, escaped on Wednesday evening (the 25th). Two puppet police officers of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" were interrogated the next morning about where they had lingered overnight. Because the answers given by the two puppet police officers were not satisfactory to the Japanese side, they were detained. Today (the 28th),

They Have All Been Jailed

The four bandits who escaped were being held in a row of car compartments behind the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters at No. 92-94 Route Ghisi. Puppet police officers were also stationed at the station to prevent the bandits from escaping, guarded by Japanese soldiers and puppet police officers armed with rifles. Two puppet police officers were stationed near the rear bucket of the car compartment, not far from the French Concession Town where the bandits were captured. However, when the

Four Bandits Escaped

The two puppet police officers were not on duty near the back of the car compartment. When Japanese authorities questioned them about the reason for leaving their posts, the two puppet police officers could not give a satisfactory explanation and were detained. The four bandits are still nowhere to be found. The remaining five bandits, including two men and three women, are still in the hands of the

Japanese Authorities

It is still unknown when they will be handed back to the Public Concession police authorities. Personnel at the police station did not comment on this incident, but it is believed that two of the four escaped bandits were the gang leaders, so the case has actually been reduced in importance. According to reports, the gang was arrested on the 4th of this month in the French Concession Town.

### 1939 Mercury Eight Cylinder Automobile

Soon to be Displayed

At the end of 1935, the Lincoln-Zephyr joined the Ford vehicle family. Since its debut, the car has been continuously improved. By 1938, its sales had exceeded those of other cars in the same price range and become the leader. In 1939, a new car was introduced, the Mercury Eight-Cylinder Automobile. The Mercury is a completely new car, positioned between the top-end Ford V8 and the Lincoln-Zephyr. Its engine is larger than the Ford V8, and the frame is thicker.

### Gold: Heavy Selling Pressure, Cash Continues to Decline

Transactions Reach 950 Taels

Yesterday, the situation in the cash gold market was slightly calmer, with a range of only three yuan throughout the day, but prices continued to trend weaker. This was because a certain silver shop suddenly released a large number of long positions on behalf of local clients, and other silver shops were also eager to sell. In addition, northern shops and cash houses successively sold, causing supply to exceed demand despite purchases by Tianjin shops, securities firms, and gold shops. As a result, prices fell by three yuan, and market sentiment remained weak. Transactions were still active, reaching 950 taels. Silver ornaments also fell by one yuan. Customs gold remained unchanged. Chinese and English pure gold rebounded.

Supply Exceeds Demand in the Cash Gold Market

In the morning, the initial asking price for the first transaction (ten taels) was 2,025-2,026 yuan. At that time, silver shops suddenly started to sell, causing the price to gradually decrease. It was not until 9:45 AM that silver shops traded 50 taels at the opening price of 1,021 yuan. Subsequently, the same silver shops sold 50 taels to a money exchange business, and a cash house sold 50 taels to a securities firm. Later, news spread that the foreign exchange market was tightening due to aggressive buying by the North China United Bank, and a certain money exchange business suddenly bought a large amount on behalf of Tianjin shops. Fortunately, the selling intentions of a certain silver shop (acting on behalf of local wealthy long positions), clients, and cash houses were still good, so the rise was limited. A certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from silver shops at 22 yuan, and another 50 taels from clients at 23.5 yuan. Another money exchange business bought 50 taels from silver shops at 24 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from silver shops, and a gold shop sold 50 taels to silver shops, both at 23 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 90 taels from silver shops, and a cash house bought 100 taels, all at the same price. A money exchange business sold 50 taels to a peer, and a client sold 50 taels to a securities firm, both at 23 yuan for the noon closing price. In the afternoon, a money exchange business first sold 50 taels to a gold shop at 23 yuan, and then a gold shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange business at 24 yuan. After that, prices fell due to hesitation from buyers. Money exchange businesses traded 50 taels at 21 yuan. Later, there were still sellers at 21 yuan, but there were very few buyers, with some only offering 18-19 yuan. Therefore, despite the opening, the evening closing price was still 2,021 yuan, a decrease of three yuan compared to the previous day. The current selling price of Xian Yuhao's brand gold is 2,030 yuan, and the buying price is 2,015 yuan. The current standard gold price is 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there are no open transactions.

Silver Ornament Prices Followed Down by One Yuan

The initial selling price of silver jewelry was unchanged, but at 10:00 AM, as the price of gold approached the 20 yuan mark, the price was lowered by one yuan. Datonghang and Laoqingyun changed their prices to 205 yuan, and Xintonghang set their price at 203 yuan, buying in at 197 yuan.

English Pure Gold Rebounds by Half a Penny

London, 27th: The price of English pure gold rebounded by half a penny to seven pounds, eight shillings, and eight and a half pence per ounce. The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold also rose to 1,214 yuan. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged at one yuan, three jiao, nine fen, and nine li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by four jiao to approximately 1,209 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Transactions Scarce

Yesterday, English pure gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rates between British and American currencies remained unchanged. The North China Puppet Bank slightly purchased foreign exchange, and there were slight sales of Hong Kong dollars. The process was stable. Gold transactions were not active, and supply and demand were relatively balanced. The trend was slightly soft. Foreign currency transactions were scarce. Market prices continued to decline slightly due to stable foreign exchange rates and slightly loosened gold prices. There were no transactions in the guild. Yesterday's market prices: English gold notes decreased by two fen, American gold pounds decreased by five fen, American gold notes decreased by half a fen, Hong Kong notes and French franc notes each decreased by one li, Annam notes decreased by three fen, Canadian notes decreased by one fen, and Philippine pesos increased by two fen. The other currencies remained unchanged.

### Discount Rates Still Hovering High

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange remained gradually high, with slight changes. It hovered around 37 yuan per thousand yuan throughout the day, with the final price being 37 yuan, a slight increase of 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day.

### Bank of England Weak for Three Consecutive Days

London, 27th: Speculators and the public sold a small amount, lacking support. The market situation was relatively stable. The closing price was flat with a slight firm tone. India bought in at 0.0625 higher than the listed price, but sellers were still unwilling to supply. The near-term interest rate for large bars of silver continued to shrink by 0.1875, and the long-term interest rate also continued to shrink by 0.125. New York silver prices remained unchanged. Bombay silver prices were slightly firm, with both spot and near-term prices increasing by three annas, and long-term prices also increasing by four annas.

### Foreign Exchange Becomes More Stable

"Lian Yin" Still Operating Secretly; Speculators Not Responding

The foreign exchange market yesterday was driven by the "North China United Reserve Bank," which again entrusted a small number of banks in the city to buy in, causing the underlying trend to tighten briefly. The tightest price for English gold was 8.3125 pence, and the softest price for American dollars was 16.21875 yuan. However, since Chinese and Western speculators did not respond, and Western firm Sassoon and others subsequently sold, the situation became more stable. Transactions were very smooth. Hong Kong exchange rates remained tight due to the strong buying interest of foreign banks and the unwillingness of money exchange businesses to supply.

Initially, London's short-term and long-term interest rates for large bars of silver continued to shrink, New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold rebounded by half a penny. The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar remained unchanged, the exchange rate against the French franc rose by 7 centimes, and the exchange rate against Shanghai was flat. The exchange rate between the dollar and the pound also remained unchanged, the exchange rate against the French franc fell by 0.125, and the exchange rate against Shanghai remained the same. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened early with a buying price of 8.34375 pence for English exchange and 16.25 yuan for American exchange, both flat compared to the previous closing price. After opening, a foreign company first sold English gold at 8.40625 pence, and the bank bought it at a bargain, so there was no change. HSBC's listed price was unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was down slightly by one cent. Subsequently, the "North China Reserve Bank" suddenly started buying English gold at 8.3125 pence and American exchange at 16.121875 yuan, and the bank refused to buy at a lower price, causing the underlying trend to tighten. However, Western firm Sassoon and American banks soon started selling English gold at 8.34375 pence and American exchange at 16.25 yuan, and foreign companies and the North China Puppet Bank's buying interest was not strong, so the situation turned flat. Foreign companies could settle American dollars at 16.25 yuan. Transactions were quiet near noon, with only money exchange businesses selling Hong Kong exchange at 55.625 yuan to Chinese-Italian, Dutch, and Chase banks. The selling price of English and American exchange rates at noon was the same as the opening price in the morning. Hong Kong exchange rates were tight by 0.375 after the settlement.

### Securities: Foreign Bonds Weak, Domestic Bonds Closed

London, 27th (Friday): The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds remained weak. All types of bonds guaranteed by upper-tier customs duties also continued to fall, while lower-tier railway bonds remained unchanged. The pound-denominated British German loan bonds continued to fall by 2 pounds to 70 pounds. The pound-denominated British good faith bonds continued to fall by half a pound to 46.5 pounds, both falling to the lowest prices of the month. The French-American five-percent dollar-denominated bonds with Indian bonds also continued to fall by half a pound to 68 pounds. However, the buying price in the market increased by 7 shillings and 6 pence to 68 pounds, 7 shillings, and 6 pence. The buying price for British good faith bonds with French printed bonds was 43 pounds and 15 shillings, and the selling price was 44 pounds and 15 shillings. The physical supply in London included 1,000 pounds of original Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds, sold at 16 pounds at par, and 3,500 pounds of Kowloon-Canton Railway bonds, sold at 18 pounds, 7 shillings, and 6 pence, a decrease of 2 shillings and 6 pence compared to yesterday's trading and prices.

Shanghai public bonds were closed yesterday in commemoration of the January 28th Shanghai Incident.

London, 27th (Friday): The listed prices of British Far East company stocks still only showed slight fluctuations in Jardine Matheson shares and Kailan Mining Administration shares. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rebounded by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 8 pounds and 15 shillings. Kailan Mining Administration bearer shares continued to fall by 6 pence to 15 shillings and 6 pence.

### Silk and Tea: Both Chinese and Foreign Silk Sales Difficult

After the sharp drop the day before, the foreign silk market stabilized yesterday. Except for Japanese silk 83 in New York, which continued to fall by 1 cent, and in Lyon, which continued to fall by 1.50 francs, other market prices, including the prices on Japanese and American exchanges, rebounded slightly. New York's near-term prices rose by 2 cents, long-term prices rose by 1 cent, Yokohama spot prices and long-term prices each rose by 13 yuan. However, Japanese and American transactions were very scarce, with only three lots traded throughout the day in New York, totaling 30 bales. It can be seen that the export silk market may not see smooth movement immediately.

In the local silk market, the limited price for foreign white factory 78 silk was 1,360 yuan, but the asking price was still 30 yuan higher, resulting in no transactions. Users' silk prices did not soften yesterday, so silk transactions were also difficult to continue smoothly. Transactions with Indian and African Zhuangkou were also quieter yesterday. If Japanese and American silk prices can maintain a stable appearance next week, both domestic and foreign silk markets in this city can return to normal. If cocoon prices skyrocket this week and domestic sales suddenly flourish, it will trap the foreign silk market in a stalemate, which is not a healthy state for the silk market.

### Piece Goods: Domestic Cloth Costs Increase, Rate Sharper Than Selling

Speculators Seize the Opportunity to Buy Without Holding Back; East Piece Goods Long-Term Goods Repeatedly Set New High Prices

Domestic cloth's raw material yarn and East piece goods are still in tight supply, costs are increasing, and the rise is faster than the selling price. Speculators seize the opportunity to buy without holding back. Sales in Shantou, Wenzhou, and Ningbo and other major ports have turned around, and the market has received support from actual sales, further increasing. White goods and colored goods each continue to rise by 1-2 jiao per piece. The banking industry speculatively bought over 100 bales of Dasheng 16-pound Shuanglong and Blue Lion coarse cloth. It is said that Yihua coarse cloth will continue to rise by 1.3 jiao next week. Customers' buying interest is increasing. Shops bought nearly 200 pieces of coarse cloth from Yihua, Dasheng, and Underwear factories, and fine cloth and twill from Dapeng, Golden Phoenix, and Cannon factories. The street bought 60-70 bales of 9-pound coarse cloth, 30 bales of heavy cloth, and 20 bales of 16-pound coarse twill, and 50 bales of low-end fine twill. Shops from Shantou and Haikou bought nearly 50 pieces of fine cloth and twill of various brands. Kunming and Chengdu bought the most colored goods, continuing to buy over 4,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, colored crepe, and colored zigzag cloth.

### Yarn and Cotton: Chinese Yarn Factories Add Foreign Cotton, Over 5,000 Bales of American and Brazilian Cotton Arrive in Shanghai

The foreign cotton market saw weak American cotton. In general, people are waiting for the resolution of European politics and Washington's cotton industry legislation and the sale of loan cotton. Yesterday's New York market saw more active forward trading. Domestic manufacturers also had some new cotton transactions, so October alone rose by 10 points.

### 20 Count Double Horse Yarn: Shenxin Opens 4,000 Bales

Yesterday, the current yarn market was closed, but there were slight transactions on the customer side.

It is said that Shenxin Factory opened a huge quantity of 4,000 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at 395 yuan, with a deposit of 40 yuan per bale.

The market opens tomorrow, and it is likely that the settlement method will be used.

Yesterday, 180 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Youtou and 15 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Grains: Flour Sales Gradually Decrease, Wheat Supply Limited

Flour: Because a large household in North China purchased and sold more than 100,000 bags of flour for several days, the flour stock of various factories has decreased. Customer sales are still active. Yesterday was the 128th anniversary, and large households in North China have reduced their purchases. Small amounts of flour sold by Fuyang shops are doing well. Factories are also limiting supply. The street sold 7,000-8,000 bags, and both northern and southern shops each sold 15,000-16,000 bags. All brands of No. 2 flour are at the original price of 4.8 yuan. Only 2,000-3,000 bags of by-product flour were traded. The market is quite stable. Yesterday, 7,500 bags were shipped to Yantai and 4,000 bags to Shantou, and 2,000 bags of bran.

Wheat: The supply is limited, and the market is difficult to rise or fall. Factories are planning to suppress the price of livestock feed, and lenders are unwilling to loosen their grip. The total transaction volume for the day was only 3,000 bags. Except for Fufeng Factory, which purchased one-third, the rest were purchased by Fuxin Factory. Prices have not changed significantly for the time being. It is reported that recently, several batches of wheat directly purchased by factories from the production area have also arrived.

### High-Grade Ke Xian Rice Still Stalling, Medium-Grade Continues to Decline

Ke Xian Rice: Both arrivals and sales were low yesterday. Yesterday, 860 bags arrived from Hupu, and only more than 400 bags of Wuhu Ke Xian rice and others were sold in the street. Nanjing Xian rice: Because the owners were unwilling to follow the market decline, they held on and did not sell. The top grade of Jing Xian rice still shouted high to 11 yuan, but buyers could not get it for less than 10.08 yuan. High-grade Wuhu Xian rice also firmly held the price of 10.05-0.06 yuan. However, at present, both customer and speculative storage are stagnant, relying only on street sales. Although high-grade goods can stand firm, medium-grade and below are affected by the street's devaluation for sale, and finally continued to decline by some margin.

### Rice Shows a Downward Trend

Yesterday, the supply of domestic rice: 6,000 bags of Hexia and Che Lun Baozi rice arrived. Sales were due to the approaching end of the year, and the warehouse was full. Rice shops also have thick inventory, so speculators are waiting and watching. Except for those who need sales, there are few inquiries in the street. As a result, the market feels more fatigued, showing a downward trend. As a result, the transaction volume of various goods was limited. Both thick and thin round-grain rice fell by 1-2 jiao. Duyang Jiantou and Butou rice also fell by some margin. The price of Yuan Rice is expensive and also affected by the round-grain rice market, down by 2-3 jiao.

### Oil Cake: Soybean Cake Exhibits Strong Potential; Soybean Cake Oil Available for Shipment

Soybean cake had once softened in price due to being undersold by Jiangbei small soybean cake, but the potential of other cakes remains tight and strong. In this extraordinary period, situations vary. Yesterday, Shantou and Xinghua made quite urgent purchases, so although there is a significant arrival of Jiangbei small soybean cake in stock, its market price is also stable. A total of 50,000 pieces of Jiangbei small soybean cake were opened, priced at 5 jiao 7 fen original plate; 1,000 pieces of Dayou Yu Factory's "Four Brands" cake, priced at 3 yuan 1 jiao 9 fen; 1,300-plus pieces of Changzhou Xiefeng Factory's "Four Brands Yuanlong" cake, priced at 3 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen (outside the concession); and 1,500-plus pieces of Changzhou Puhe Factory's "Four Brands Feizi" cake, priced at 3 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen 5 li.

Yesterday, 1,500 pieces of crude oil were shipped to Ningbo, and 300 pieces to Hong Kong.

5,000 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Shantou.

800 bags of soybeans were shipped to Shantou, and 1,250 bags to Hong Kong.

### Imports and Exports: Lumber and Tobacco Imported

Yesterday, over 56,800 pieces of lumber arrived from Fuzhou, 2,500 pieces of local paper from Ningbo, 1,900 pieces of tobacco leaves, 1,500 pieces of local paper shipped to Yantai, and 110 pieces of egg yolk and white shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Coarse White Plummets 4 Jiao

Yesterday, Dutch coarse white sugar plummeted due to a telegram from Java. 500 tons of printed packaging were transacted at 4 guilders 925 Dutch currency. Trading firms are still trying to sell, and the trend has suddenly weakened. Therefore, the guild's quoted price for re-export goods plummeted by 4 jiao. Initially, over 100 bags were traded at 16 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, but later, even at 16 yuan 4 jiao, there were few buyers, indicating that the market may need to soften further. Domestic sugar also saw little change. Only Guangdong opened a batch of "pian qing," priced at 11 yuan 8 jiao. Yesterday, 1,600 bags were shipped to Duobo.

### Metals: White Lead Sheets, Extreme Stillness Arousing Movement

Since the National Army moved west, white lead sheets have been unable to be exported due to customs restrictions, resulting in a plummet in market conditions. Because local battery factories have ceased operations, actual sales have been sluggish, and the market has not been inquired about for as long as eighteen months. Recently, however, the old view has changed, and the market has turned from stillness to movement. More people in the market are inquiring and handling transactions. Although prices have not yet rebounded, in this period of tight foreign exchange, various markets have been able to stand firm and not fall. Currently, grade 2 is selling at 225 yuan per barrel, grade 3 at 230 yuan, grade 4 at 215 yuan, grade 5 at 210 yuan, grade 6 at 200 yuan, grades 7 and 8 at 188 yuan, grade 9 at 220 yuan, and grade 10 at 225 yuan. Thick floral patterns are priced between 205 yuan and 225 yuan, varying. Yesterday, 70 to 80 barrels were traded, acquired by groups from Tianjin, Qingdao, and local battery factories. However, the base inventory is unusually thin, and sentiment is remarkably firm. Therefore, there is optimism about the market, and overseas pricing has recently reached around 25 pounds, suggesting that there will be no sign of a return to weakness in the future.

### How to Study Current Events?

— Gong Huai

Living in this great era, the changing global landscape and the evolution of the Sino-Japanese war are inextricably linked to us. Therefore, it is necessary for children to study current events.

Steps:

First, one must have a very basic understanding of geography and history. Ideally, one should read biographies of famous contemporary figures to easily understand news reports. Also, a map is an essential tool for studying current events. If it's a large map, it can be hung on the wall with small colored paper triangles attached to pins, marking areas of interest. This way, the next day, one won't be clueless and can follow events on the map. If it's a book of maps, flip through it to understand the location and relationships of places.

Second, one should understand the background of newspapers and news agencies, as every piece of news speaks for its "owner," inevitably exaggerating or concealing facts. If children don't understand this background, they can easily be deceived. For example, most large newspapers in Shanghai are run by British and American commercial companies, so their opinions naturally favor our country in the war of resistance. Other news agencies include Reuters (British), Domei (Japanese), TASS (Soviet), Associated Press (American), Hutung (German), and Central News Agency (Chinese). We must also know this to avoid being poisoned by counter-propaganda and gain an accurate understanding of the current situation.

Third, it's best to connect with classmates or neighbors with similar interests and form a "Current Events Study Group" or "Current Events Discussion Group." Set one or two central topics each week, hold regular meetings, and invite teachers or parents with expertise in current events to attend and guide the discussions. Each person can present their research findings or opinions for discussion, and the guide can correct any errors. This not only saves time but also gathers collective wisdom.

Fourth, keep a notebook to record important daily events. Once a problem is resolved, provide a concise summary. Also, keep an old, unused book and paste important telegrams, documents, etc., from newspapers to it for future reference.

Children, if you find the above helpful, try doing it. If you encounter any problems, difficulties, or need supplements in practice, we can discuss them later!

### Becoming a Little Radio Enthusiast

— Xi Ren

To the children!

Dear children! Have you all seen a radio? I believe you have. So, I ask you, do you find it amazing? How can a small square box sing softly when plugged into electricity?

Children, don't be surprised. This is science. If you understand its principles, you can understand why it makes sound.

However, these principles are very deep, and even adults sometimes don't understand them clearly. We are still young, so understanding how to build one is enough. As we become more familiar with it, we will naturally understand its principles.

Children, I don't know if you like doing this? If you do, please read quietly. The story inside is very interesting, and I think you will definitely like it.

Okay, please listen to the story quietly!

(1) Wang Min and His Cousin

Wang Min is a sixth-grader at Guoqun Elementary School. He is very diligent in his studies, especially in natural science, always scoring 100 points. Therefore, he is praised by teachers and classmates as "Wang Min is a good student!"

Wang Min's father is an employee at a bank with a high monthly income. Therefore, he always gives Wang Min some money each month. However, Wang Min doesn't waste the money, nor does he buy snacks, because he knows that unhealthy snacks are harmful to the stomach. So what does he do with the money? He saves it little by little to build a radio.

His interest in radio began last summer. He had just finished fourth grade. Of course, he knew nothing about radio, but coincidentally, he had a cousin studying in Nanjing who came to stay at his house in Shanghai during summer vacation.

His cousin was very knowledgeable about radio. He could build a four-tube radio by himself, as well as a receiver and transmitter. Do you know what a receiver and transmitter are, children? They are the machines we usually see in radio stations used for sending telegrams, which are very difficult to make.

However, Wang Min didn't quite believe it at first. "Can he really build a radio?" He often said this.

Once, Wang Min even asked his cousin, "Brother, can you really build a radio?" But his cousin didn't answer, just smiled. This made him even more suspicious.

It was on the fourth day after his cousin arrived—a hot afternoon. Wang Min's aunt went to visit relatives, and even the nanny went with her. Only he and his cousin were at home.

His cousin took out many things from a suitcase. Some were square, some were round, some were flat, some were long, and some were sheets. There were all sorts of shapes, but Wang Min didn't know their names.

Curious, he picked up a square thing with sheets of tin on it, turning it over and over, looking at it for almost five minutes without understanding what it was. He then curiously grabbed the handle and twisted it forcefully, and the sheets of tin started to rotate. This surprised him, and he couldn't help but ask his cousin, "Brother, what is this?"

### Small Book Stalls

— Ding Kang

Dear children, do you see small book stalls on the roadside when you go home from school every day? I think children must have seen them, and they must have gone to see the small books at the stalls.

The books at the stalls are very cheap. You can borrow a book for only one or three copper coins. But the children who read books at the stalls are mostly children from poor families who are not clean. If you sit on the same bench with them, you will definitely get contagious diseases. My friend's younger brother also likes to read books. He always goes to the book stall to read after school every day. Unexpectedly, he recently developed a contagious disease. He hired a doctor, who said, "This is a very contagious disease. It's best to pay attention to his diet (which means no fish or meat)." And the school doesn't allow him to study. He is very miserable. It has been a month, and the disease has not fully healed. Think about it, children, is it worth getting a contagious disease for one copper coin to read a book?

So from today on, children, don't go to the book stalls to read anymore. Besides, the books at the stalls are meaningless. They will hurt your brains. If you must read, then go to various bookstores on Sundays and look at the books. Buy a few books that you like and read them. Children should never read the books at the stalls.

### The Clipper Ship, Creating a New Epoch in Transportation History between China and the United States

— Xinsheng

The Republic of China and the United States of America are neighbors across the vast Pacific Ocean. Although these two republics are located on opposite sides of the Pacific, they are friends across the ocean. They have considerable relations in politics, economics, and culture!

In the past, traveling from China to the United States or from the United States to China relied on water transportation. Ordinary mail ships took about fifteen days, and the fastest took ten days. Cargo ships took more than twenty days! But since Pan American Airways established the trans-Pacific Sino-American air route, traveling from the United States to China takes only six long-distance flights, setting a new record. The relationship between the two countries has become closer. The travel time for diplomatic officials, famous figures, tourists, and the transportation of mail and goods can be shortened. The distant ocean is now as close as in front of our eyes. We must give credit to the application of 20th-century scientific inventions in the transportation industry for this success!

"Flying Clipper" is the Chinese translation of "Clipper" (meaning speedboat). It is the name of the large flying boats used by Pan American Airways for long-distance flights. The Hawaii, Philippines, and China Clippers were ordered from the Martin Aircraft Factory. These Martin-style flying boats weigh 25.5 tons. The upper wing is 130 feet long, and the lower wing (water surface wing) is quite short. Each side can store 790 gallons of gasoline. In addition to serving as fuel tanks, the lower wing also has the function of a pontoon, helping to stabilize the boat on the water. The boat has four engines, each with 1,000 horsepower. These four engines are installed on the upper wing, two on each side. The flight speed can reach 165 miles per hour. Each flying boat can carry seven crew members, thirty passengers, and mail and goods. It takes only forty to fifty seconds to take off when heavily loaded. The flying altitude is usually around 8,000 feet, but it can be as high as 13,000 feet or as low as 1,000 feet above the sea.

Pan American Airways initially used the Pan American Clipper (18 tons) for trial flights. After more than twenty trial flights between the Pacific islands, the China Clipper flew from the United States to Manila on November 22, 1935. This route officially opened on October 21, 1936. On April 28, 1937, the Hong Kong Clipper picked up mail from the United States carried by the China Clipper in Manila and flew to Macau and then to Hong Kong. The mail was then transported to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes. This marked the completion of the first official Sino-American air route. However, since the outbreak of the war, Pan American Airways has continued to use Manila as the terminal in the Far East. This air route runs from San Francisco in the United States through Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, Manila, and Hong Kong, with a total length of over 8,600 miles. Each station along the route is equipped with telecommunications, weather forecasting, lodging, fuel, auxiliary equipment, and mechanical repair facilities. Pan American Airways has done everything possible for this route! However, since last year, the Samoa Clipper crashed in January, and the Hawaii Clipper disappeared at the end of July. Pan American Airways has suffered considerable losses, but they are still working hard to keep the Pacific air route running. This progressive spirit of service is very admirable!

Children, are you interested in this long-distance flight that spans the Pacific Ocean and connects Asia and America?!

### Hypocrisy

— Bai Zheng

—The Diary of Ming'er's Escape, Episode Eleven—

On the second afternoon of sailing on this small river, the boatmen tried their best to hurry on, planning to reach Hangzhou that evening, but time did not permit. Ming'er's father had told the boatmen that they must spend the night near a small town, which was safer. What would happen if they rested in a deserted village near the wilderness and encountered misfortune? No one would hear their shouts. But today there was no way to reach Hangzhou, and there was no small town nearby. At the same time, it was getting dark, so the boatmen lost their direction and had to stop near the shore. Ming'er's father anxiously asked the boatman, "Is this place okay?" The boatman answered vaguely, "It's okay." Ming'er stuck his head out of the cabin and looked outside. It was a vast wilderness with no sound, no people, and no light. It was pitch black, with only one or two large trees scattered around, gloomy, which made Ming'er's hairs stand on end. He was filled with terror and thought secretly, "What if some robbers came at night, with fierce faces, rough hands, and bright knives..." The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became.

That night, the sky was covered with black clouds, with no stars, no moon, and no light. The three small boats hid in the depths of a clump of reeds, lying quietly. From a distance, they looked like three small fireflies, flickering in the reeds. Ming'er's heart was still beating fast, and the family members all lay down with their heads tucked in. Ming'er sat on the hard boards of the boat, worrying about the unfortunate encounter that might happen that night. How could he fall asleep? It was not comfortable to put his head to the east, nor to the west. There was no place to put it. The more he couldn't sleep, the more he thought and looked around, which increased his terror. The boatman's snoring in the cabin erupted from time to time, and the ghost-like oil lamp also went out. Everything in front of him reached the extreme of darkness, so that he could not even see his own outstretched hand.

A gust of wind like a lion's roar swept through, blowing against the reed leaves, making rustling sounds, as if responding. The wind blew straight on Ming'er's face from the cracks in the boat boards. He was drowsy at this time and was awakened by it. He opened his ears and heard the roar of the wind outside, mixed with a burst of messy footsteps. He was terrified and screamed. This scream woke up everyone on the boat, and his mother came to his side, took his hand, and asked, "Ming'er, Ming'er, what's wrong?" Ming'er's face turned pale, his eyes wide open, and his hands were icy cold. His mother knew that he was frightened, so she said, "Ming'er, don't be scared." Ming'er gradually calmed down and heard nothing but the sound of the wind outside. Where did the footsteps come from? It was his own nerves that were out of order. He said, "When I was drowsy and about to fall asleep just now, I suddenly heard a burst of footsteps. I was so scared that I screamed unconsciously. Now I know that I was scaring myself." Then he gradually returned to normal, and his hands warmed up. The wind was still roaring outside, and gusts of cold wind were still blowing on Ming'er's face, making him shiver for a while. He had deeply tasted the bitterness of being a refugee. But in no time, he fell asleep, only able to comfort his pain in his sleep.

### Snow White (5)

— Tiansun

But they woke up again soon after falling asleep. It turned out that a joyful song was being transmitted from the forest, directly into their ears.

They knew that this joyful singing sound was hinting that the owner of the small house was coming back and was approaching step by step. But the petite Snow White was so tired that she didn't hear or know anything. She was still sleeping quietly in the bedroom upstairs on the three small beds.

Now we have to go back to the situation in the palace. After issuing the poisonous order to kill Snow White, the queen paced back and forth on the smooth marble floor, waiting impatiently for the hunter to return and report, so as to hear the news of Snow White's tragic death. After waiting for a long time, the hunter finally came and presented the jewel-encrusted box to the queen with both hands. The queen smiled slightly, knowing that he had completed her orders. But she didn't know that what was in the box was not Snow White's heart, but the heart of a wild boar that the hunter had killed in the forest to impersonate it.

Immediately, she hurried to the magic mirror in the secret room again, admired herself in the mirror, and proudly asked, "Mirror on the wall! I want to ask you, who is the most beautiful woman in the world now?"

Unexpectedly, the answer from the magic mirror was completely unexpected and not what she wanted to hear. She only heard the mirror say loudly, "On the Seven Treasure Mountain, outside the Seventh Waterfall, in the small house of the Seven Dwarfs, lives Snow White. She is the most beautiful woman in the world!"

The queen grinned and took out the treasure box, placed it in front of the mirror, and said coldly, "Snow White is already dead. Look—inside this treasure box is her heart!"

The magic mirror, after hearing these words, made a sound that was both mocking and sarcastic, and replied, "Snow White is still alive. She is the most beautiful woman in the world. What is contained in the treasure box in your hand is actually the heart of a wild boar!"

Upon hearing this, the queen was furious and couldn't help but roar. It turned out that the hunter had disobeyed her orders and secretly let Snow White go. She calmed herself down and said to herself, "This hateful slave dares to ruin my affairs. I must punish him well to calm my anger. But my first step is to deal with this little thing, Snow White. I must first go to the dwarfs' house and finish her off. In less than a day, I will be the most beautiful woman in the world again."

Poor Snow White initially thought that the small house was inhabited by seven orphans, but it turned out that they were not orphans, but seven dwarfs. They were very old, but very small, and each of them was a very playful and funny character. For hundreds of years, they went to a large mountain every day and worked diligently with their pickaxes all day long. When the sun went down, they threw down their pickaxes and sang in unison, "Hi ho, hi ho, our work is done, we're going home."

It was this singing sound of returning home that was carried far into the house, waking up the sleeping animals, who slipped outside. Only Snow White was still sleeping upstairs, continuing to have her good dreams.

Statement: The illustrations for Snow White in the previous two issues were drawn by Jiang Xiaoliu, a 13-year-old child. Because the manuscripts were not signed, this statement is made.

Children's Corner

### "January 28th" is Here

— Liu Jiyuan, Fifth Grade Student, Minsheng Elementary School

Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, January 28th is already in its seventh year! Counting on our fingers, this year is exactly the seventh year! I never thought that the seven years after January 28th would be the days when China could hold its head high.

Having spent January 28th on an isolated island, this year is the second year. When everyone celebrated January 28th last year, although everyone felt the bad environment, they were very optimistic. What about this year? The environment is still the same, but we are even more optimistic.

We know that January 28th was the first shot of China's resistance to foreign aggression. From January 28th, people all over the country learned a valuable lesson: to strive for survival, only resistance is good. Non-resistance will surely lead to destruction. Resistance is the only way to survive.

That's right, now that we have resisted, aren't we more free than before? This is an iron-like explanation!

Although seven years have passed since January 28th, the spirit of courageously dying for the country of the martyrs of January 28th must always be imprinted in our minds. Our responsibilities will become even heavier in the future. Everyone work hard! Fulfill the responsibility of a child.

### Report Card

— Yang Sheng, Sixth Grade Student, Shanghai Elementary School

After the exams, the winter vacation began, and the report card was sent from the school to my home and presented before my eyes. After reading that report card, I was really ashamed! It took so much of my father's hard-earned money, but the grades I got were so bad. If I don't work harder, it's really inexcusable. The grades for "English" and "Natural Science" on the report card are both C, and "Arithmetic" is B. I think I must work twice as hard on these major subjects in the future. "Calligraphy" is D! But I am not discouraged. I will practice calligraphy every morning to correct the mistakes of the past. The teacher also said that "I am not diligent in service," and I really don't want to do things very much. This is probably due to laziness! I think I need to change this character as well.

Children! Report cards are a good opportunity for us to get rid of our bad habits in the past! I hope that the children will keep the report card on the table for a long time as our motto, work hard on the subjects with bad grades, and also work hard on the subjects with good grades, and get rid of bad habits, so that we can become good students.

### A Letter Encouraging a Friend to Cherish Time

— Wu Wanchuan, Fifth Grader, Xin Ya Elementary School

Dear Senior Xuejie Youren,

It's been a long time since we last met, and I miss you very much. How has your health been recently? I heard Sister Aizhen say that you have been enjoying playing a lot lately and haven't been reviewing your lessons at home. I think you must know the ancient saying, "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time!" Time passes and cannot be returned, so we should seize it tightly and use it for various endeavors; especially we children should seize the opportunity of our youth to earnestly seek knowledge, lest we "fail to exert ourselves when young, and only lament our old age." Therefore, I hope you will cherish time, read more, and play less. Sister Ren! You are a person who readily accepts good advice, and I believe you will accept my sincere advice! Wishing you progress in your studies. Your younger sister, Wanchuan, the twenty-fifth.

— Lin Zaixu, Fifth Grader, Wushi Elementary School

Master! It has been more than ten days since you caught me and locked me in this cage. I appreciate your kindness in giving me water to drink and rice to eat every day; people say I am fortunate, but I hate my bad fate, "because I have lost my freedom and my spirit of self-reliance."

Master, are you going to say I am still young? In fact, I am not small, and even if I were small, does that mean a small bird cannot be self-reliant and must be raised by you?

Master, please save your water and rice, and spare your efforts, let me go out, and give me a chance for freedom and self-reliance!

Spring and Autumn

### Silent as Cicadas in Winter

— Yan Gong

"Silent as cicadas in winter" is used to describe a weak person who dares to be angry but dares not speak, or who has hidden grievances. It contains so much tragic resentment, a mix of sour, spicy, and bitter flavors. There are examples to prove it, as reported in the news:

"In the Japanese Lower House meeting, the deputies unanimously cast votes of confidence in the government's plan and expressed full cooperation. However, the current Japanese Diet can only approve the government's work, and the legislative function has long been lost; even those deputies who formerly opposed government policies are now silent as cicadas in winter, not uttering a word."

"At the intersection of the British and French concessions and the Chinese area in Tianjin, there is only a deep, long, and narrow passageway for passage. When entering or leaving the Chinese area, one must take off all clothing and socks and stand naked, regardless of gender, in the passageway to await a thorough search. In this cold winter, the pedestrians, standing naked on the road, cannot help but shiver. If they utter even a slight complaint, they will be punched and kicked. People who suffer this abuse have no choice but to endure humiliation and shame, and remain silent as cicadas in winter."

Although the subjects of these two news items are different, one being members of parliament and the other being ordinary people suffering under the iron heel, their situations are the same, and their sad and helpless emotions are also the same. Needless to say, the Chinese people in the occupied areas live a life of misery every day, at the mercy of others for their lives and property. Even the Japanese people, under the high pressure of the militarists' brutal and bellicose policies, have no freedom or security. Even those high-ranking members of parliament, although they have now seen through the militarists' hypocritical propaganda and feel that the fate of the country is hanging by a thread, have long been subdued by the militarists and dare not act differently. So everyone can only be "silent as cicadas in winter."

### Animals in Tokyo

— Ge Er

The Japanese "wartime conservation movement" is indeed more successful than ours in China. Some time ago, I saw that Japanese elementary school students didn't even have leather shoes to wear, so when I saw that our "children" not only didn't go barefoot, but there were even several "children's clothing companies" opening in Shanghai, I couldn't help but feel a little disheartened. They are the aggressor nation, willing to "conserve" even the leather shoes of elementary school students to strengthen their aggression. And we China, is the nation being aggressed upon, if the war of resistance is unfavorable, then the fate of "slave" will immediately fall on the heads of every compatriot throughout the country.

Later, I learned from the newspaper that Japanese cabinet ministers were celebrating something and stopped drinking champagne, instead drinking rice wine. This top-down spirit of strict conservation is truly great. Also, recently, "Central China Commander" Hata Shunroku "General" returned home in glory, and the imperial family, in order to save kerosene, completely put aside cars. So the vehicles welcoming this "General" were very apologetic and had to use "horse-drawn carriages."

Recently, there was another news item in the newspaper, "Lions and tigers in Tokyo Zoo also participate in the wartime conservation movement." According to that news, "Two lions in the Tokyo Zoo are also participating in the national wartime conservation movement, abandoning horse meat and feeding on rabbit meat and fish. The practice of replacing horse meat with rabbit meat for the two lions' two meals a day has been going on for several months. But giving them three raw mackerel for dinner is 'a recent development'." In this situation, there is no doubt that conservation will continue. Although the zookeeper reported, "At first, the two lions did not eat this fish, but now the two lions also eat the fish with relish," whether they will still "eat with relish" after not being able to eat meat and eating fish remains to be "tested." However, the "conservation" of lions is limited in any case.

"Lions roar when they are hungry!" In this way, I can't help but worry about our "friendly nation" when I see "Lions and tigers in Tokyo Zoo also participate in the wartime conservation movement!"

### A Wailing in the Cold Night

— Wei

The mad wind emitted a whistling, triumphant laugh, and the withered, yellow leaves forced out rustling, sorrowful sighs. This scene revealed the arrival of the hateful, cruel winter, hinting at a tragic scene of the survival of the fittest.

On a certain night, it was almost twelve o'clock. Most of the shops on both sides of the road, except for cigarette shops, food shops, public stoves, and a few unnamed small shops, had closed their doors and windows, ending their day's business. Fortunately, the streetlights on the asphalt road emitted a faint light, along with the lights from the shops, which made the road somewhat bright. Everything on the road indicated a state of silence, except for the plane trees by the roadside, three or four rickshaws, and a few pedestrians wearing thick overcoats. What a tragic, silent winter night!

"×……×……Evening News"! This was the cry of the evening news seller, coming from afar with the wind; this cry was mixed with sighs of enduring the cold. A person around fifty years old, wearing a tattered black cotton-padded jacket, with short, torn trousers underneath, dragging a pair of heelless shoes, holding several copies of the ×× Evening News in his hand, walked closer from afar, and the sound of his cry gradually approached. However, since he received the newspapers, not many customers had visited; although his stomach was still empty, constantly emitting faint sounds of hunger; he touched the money in his pocket, and besides the capital, he hadn't earned enough to buy some snacks, so he had no choice but to eat some cold wind to satisfy his hunger. Under the pressure of life, he had to make a decision, to sound his roar and move forward, hoping to attract customers and fulfill some of his hopes—but when the road was so cold and desolate, and there were so few pedestrians, how could that hope be achieved? But he didn't ask, just moved forward and roared.

Afterwards, his cry was already hoarse, his mouth was dry, and his feet were stiff from the cold, but he didn't care, still emitting some of his last roars and moving forward.

### Cutting Off "Gonads"

— Lishi

Gonads (Gonita Gland) is a physiological term, also known as sex glands. In males, it is the testicles, and in females, it is the ovaries. Testicles and ovaries, in addition to producing sperm and eggs, also engage in endocrine functions, which are crucial to physiology.

Gonads are a necessary tool for reproducing the population and continuing the human race. If people did not have gonads, the world today would be a different place.

People have intelligence, foolishness, virtue, and wickedness. According to geneticists, the intelligent and virtuous produce the intelligent and virtuous, and the foolish and wicked produce the foolish and wicked. "Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, and rats are born to dig holes in walls." Although this is a folk saying criticizing human species, it is also influenced by genetics. Therefore, the anthropologist Galton, in order to improve the character and physique of the human race, also advocated selecting spouses, eliminating bad breeds, and preserving good breeds based on Mendel's law of heredity. Eugenics thus began, and the gonads began to encounter misfortune.

According to recent news, members of the Japanese Minseito Party believe that promoting racial eugenics is a pressing issue today and intend to propose a bill in the Diet to cut off gonads in order to advance this cause. The reasons and specific measures on which they based this were not mentioned in the telegram, so it is impossible to speculate. However, from a human perspective, the so-called "superior" Yamato race certainly needs to be improved.

The character of the Yamato race's soldiers, as newly manifested in China, is: tyrannical, greedy, lecherous, and murderous. Not only are Chinese compatriots suffering from their actions, and cursing them, but even righteous friendly people, witnessing these atrocities, must spit and condemn them. This is not only a disgrace to humanity, but also a sin. However, we cannot say that this manifestation is entirely due to the Yamato race's innate heredity, but rather the result of the anti-China policies promoted by their militarists, in other words: due to postnatal education. For this reason, we believe that the Minseito Party members' proposal of a "racial eugenics protection bill" advocating the cutting off of gonads seems not to have "hit the nail on the head." No wonder it has "aroused strong opposition from all sides," of course, the biggest background of opposition is the fascist militarists. In order to have a large number of tools of aggression, the fascist militarists, not long ago, incited so-called scholars who used to advocate birth control to advocate encouraging childbirth. Now, cutting off gonads and completely removing the function of the sex glands, how can they tolerate it? This further shows the Minseito Party members' "lack of understanding of the times."

However, coming back to the point, the Japanese Diet is now in the clutches of the Japanese militarists. Generally speaking, members dare not say much about national policies, lest they stroke the tiger's whiskers and provoke the tiger's wrath. Their attendance in the Diet is like going to a school to listen to stories; in order to fulfill formalities and cope with the "porters," they have to come up with some novel, non-essential topics to start a debate and harmonize the gloomy atmosphere of the Diet. Look at the term "cutting off gonads," how attention-grabbing it is. But let us not forget that this is precisely the cry of Japanese members in a declining Japanese Diet.

### Military School Glory

— Yan Hua

“Brother Rat”

Produced by Warner Bros., Shown at Cathay Theatre

Regarding American films using the navy and army as the background, we can probably see two points: (1) They are declaring America's military expansion, showing the power of their navy and army. In the past, many such films were made with the consent of the government's navy and army authorities, and the government gave them great assistance. From this point of view, this threatening meaning to the world is clear and obvious; (2) Not showing the power of American naval and army cannons and aircraft carriers in terms of military equipment, the focus of the film is on how the current American government is strictly training their naval and army recruits to cope with the next more terrible war.

The past "High Flyers" and "Cadets on Parade" represent this typical type of film.

"Brother Rat" is also a film similar to "Cadets on Parade": taking the American military school as the background, while specially emphasizing how these young and strong young soldiers are dissolute in school, how they roll around in a pink atmosphere all day long, they not only dare to break into the principal's house and flirt with the principal's daughter, but even these students who are making trouble at night also bring those young girls to the dormitories of the military school. Under such a serious theme, through the erotic, decadent American playwrights, this "Military School Glory" representing the life of American army students has also become a flirting paradise.

Drama should reflect society, but through the hands of American playwrights, true materials all become a confused mess. "Brother Rat" is just a small example of this.

Accordingly, we can say that "Brother Rat" has lost its authenticity. Although drama has its exaggerations, a drama that loses its authenticity is, of course, very low in value.

This script was originally adapted from an ancient stage play. Although the distribution of characters is quite lively, most of the development of the play takes place in that dormitory, and it has not escaped the scope of stage play.

However, in terms of compilation techniques, this is naturally a fairly successful film: the personalities of the three male protagonists and the demeanor of the two female protagonists reveal the characteristics of each character in the film; that reckless and presumptuous Billy; that woman-hating Crawford; that melancholic Edward; apart from Crawford's character not being clear enough, the personalities of Billy and Edward are captured strongly and vividly.

As for the atmosphere of the whole play, under the support of William Keighley, its tone is not only cheerful, but also unusually humorous; we are not saying that the excellence of the director's techniques conceals the erotic, distorted poison of the whole play, but among the many techniques used by the director, there are indeed many places worth learning.

We can see a glimpse of William Keighley's techniques from the following two most prominent scenes: (1) Edward is still staying at Betsy's house, when suddenly there is a assembly bugle outside. Edward intends to run out, but suddenly remembers his hat. He comes back in, and Betsy, Betsy's aunt, and the maid all follow Edward around the room. Edward goes there, and they follow him there. At this time, Edward is indeed looking for his hat, and the audience is also looking for Edward's hat, until Edward finds the hat on the tea chair and smoothly passes the scene; this scene is very ordinary, but after William Keighley's treatment, it becomes a very lively scene; (2) the army principal's daughter, Greer, sneaks into Billy's dormitory and teaches Edward chemistry. Although the techniques used are stage-like, through the suffocating, tense atmosphere, it deeply captures the audience's emotions. The techniques used are: first, the swaying of shadows, the lights being turned off in the dormitory, and the frantic hiding; second, the principal comes in to check at night with a flashlight; third, Billy brings Betsy to knock on the window; fourth, the dormitory supervisor who is checking the dormitory suddenly comes in, and everyone is caught drinking and eating bread. When the supervisor comes in, everyone hides too late, and the director vividly depicts the chaotic state of the room. At the same time, everyone thinks that this time it is over, but the playwright makes the principal's daughter stick out her head and say, "The principal wouldn't be happy to know either!" as the ending of the whole play, which is clever enough.

As for the actors, I think Eddie Albert, who plays Edward, has the most obvious and successful personality. The rest, such as Wayne Morris, Priscilla Lane, and Jane Wyman, are all fluent and natural.

Correction: In yesterday's (26th) issue of this journal, in the article "Salted Pork Shop and Little Traitors," the character "enter" was incorrectly printed with an × mark. This is hereby corrected.

Chapter 3: Adoring the Remains and Remembering the Old Righteous Man, Opening the Eyes of the Illiterate and Asking Questions to the Little Teacher

Let's say that Miss Jin Danyun was dining at the Lingcun restaurant with the two Misses He and their fiancés. Because today is Sunday, many people who came to visit the martyrs' tombs came here to eat, and in a moment, it felt like there were clouds of scholars and ladies. Wang Jing then went to greet other guests. Of course, this back room did not have just seven or eight seats, and Wang Jing was not the only one serving. Wang Jing left, and others came to greet, but the guests adding rice themselves is now taken for granted. Recently, young men and women are ashamed of developing a lazy and arrogant style. Since I am a human being, I also have four limbs and hundreds of bones, and I am not a cripple, so why should others do some small things for me? More than ten years ago, some young masters and ladies from wealthy families would often call for servants and maids, opening their mouths for tea and reaching out for food. This trend has been reformed a lot in the post-war, emerging China. Although the two Misses He, for example, grew up in luxurious families and have always been abroad, never experiencing any war or suffering in the country, when they returned to their motherland and looked around, they also felt that the future revival of China rested entirely on the shoulders of our young men and women, and this was not an era for leisure and enjoyment. The four people eating at this table today have all been abroad, so they talk casually and inevitably touch on foreign countries. Lin Jiancheng said, "Sixty years ago, Chinese people looked down on foreigners. They said that China was a land of etiquette and righteousness, and foreign countries were barbaric tribes, and even in writing, they used those terrible words on them. For example, the three characters for 'England,' each character had to have a mouth radical added, becoming 咭唎, in order to appear in official documents. Also, when referring to foreigners, they called them 'foreign devils.' Even though Shanghai was a commercial port where Chinese and foreigners lived together, they still called them something devils, such as finger-ghost foreign instrument devil and the like. This self-aggrandizing mentality could never be changed. Later, as a backlash, it changed to everything foreign being good. Whatever foreigners have, Chinese people must also have. The ancient Chinese books say that Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi's frown is absolutely correct. Naturally, Europe and America are advanced countries, and they have many inventions, and we enjoy the fruits of their labor, benefiting a lot from their light. But some things can be learned; some things don't need to be learned; some things work very well in Europe and America, but don't work in China; some things are a noble profession in Europe and America, but become terrible when they come to China." Pointing to Miss Jin, he said, "Your current guide was considered a lowly profession more than ten years ago!" (25)

Wu Song and Pan Jinlian

I have seen three productions of "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" in Shanghai. One was starring Zhou Xinfang, one was starring Gai Jiaotian, and one was recently performed by Yu Sulian at the Golden Theatre.

Zhou Xinfang's performance was based on Ouyang Yuqian's script, which differed from those performed by others in that it contained many new nationalistic terms in the lyrics. Xinfang's Wu Song is known for his vigor, and his expressions and acting skills are beyond Gai Wu's reach. Moreover, Xinfang's drama focuses on acting, unlike Gai Wu, who makes money by selling Wu Er, so in practice, Xinfang's drama is the most brilliant. However, I have seen Xinfang's drama twice, once with Zhao Xiaolan playing Pan Jinlian and once with Wang Xichun playing Pan Jinlian, neither of which was very good. Moreover, Li Hansan, who played Wu Da, lacked artistic talent, so Xinfang was unable to achieve the effect of green leaves enhancing the peony. Judging from the three performances of "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" that I have seen, the most well-matched cast was that of Gai Wu. I previously saw Gai Wu perform this play with Li Guiyun from the north playing Pan Jinlian, Wang Xiaofang playing Ximen Qing, and Shou Xiaoshan, known for playing Wu Da well, playing Wu Da. The completeness of this cast was remarkable. Recently, Yu Sulian performed this play at the Golden Theatre with Ma Shenglong playing Wu Song and Li Junyu playing Ximen Qing, both of whom were mediocre. Although Sulian is good at playing shrewish roles, she failed to portray Pan Jinlian accurately, so the performance was not satisfactory. The good thing is that Liu Yunting, who played Wu Da, had considerable artistic talent and inadvertently discovered this new talent.

Liu Yunting and Liu Binkun and Liu Yunfang are brothers. He has a martial arts background. His elder brother, Binkun, is a famous clown in Jiangnan. Yunting received guidance from his elder brother and is also skilled in open-mouth jumps. Binkun's performance as Wu Da can be called first-rate in Jiangnan. However, he rarely performs, so few people know about it. Yunting's leg work is extremely solid. He has worked hard at walking low and somersaulting. This time, he showed it at the Golden Theatre, and it was greatly appreciated by the general public. Gai Xiaoshan's Wu Da is certainly good, but unfortunately, he has a Kunqu Opera background and speaks mostly Suzhou dialect. Compared with Yunting, Gai Xiaoshan is slightly inferior.

Because Liu Yunting's Wu Da was a surprising success, the facts tell us that Liu Binkun's performance as Wu Da must be excellent. The Kunqu Opera actresses in Shanghai who are good at playing Pan Jinlian is Mao Jianqiu. I would like to suggest to the Performing Arts Association that if they were to arrange a Wu Song and Pan Jinlian for a charity performance, with Zhou Xinfang and Gai Jiaotian playing Wu Song separately, Mao Jianqiu playing Pan Jinlian, and Liu Binkun playing Wu Da, it would not only be able to make a splash, but it could also be said to be an unprecedented and unparalleled good show.

### Portrait Observation

— Yi Yi

Almost a month ago, I heard that the Art Academy was going to have an art exhibition different from other art exhibitions. This art exhibition was finally seen yesterday amidst extreme crowding. I lingered inside for a good hour and indeed discovered several characteristics different from other art exhibitions.

The first characteristic is that all the proceeds from this exhibition are donated to refugees, unlike other so-called disaster relief art exhibitions that only deduct relief or recover the cost of materials.

The second characteristic is that although the Chinese and Western paintings in the venue are priced, they all have a number. As long as you spend five yuan on a drawing ticket, you can draw a work by the teachers and students of the Art Academy and many famous artists. Last week, the national painting of Liu Haisu, the principal of the Art Academy, exhibited at the Great World, cost at least fifty yuan per piece, but now you can draw it here for only five yuan.

The third characteristic is that the students of the Art Academy will draw portraits of guests on the spot during the exhibition period. This characteristic is the characteristic among the three characteristics.

There were so many people, forming a semi-circular meat screen, inside which was a middle-aged man with deep eyes and a hooked nose acting as a temporary model, having his portrait drawn by five male and female students from the Art Academy. Even the four or five hundred pairs of eyes of the audience were fixed on him alone. It took about fifteen minutes to complete the drawing. When each portrait was placed in front of him by each student from the Art Academy, he looked at his own little image as if choosing a mirror.

"They all look alike! I don't want that one, I can't even pick one out!"

He reluctantly looked through them one by one. But according to the rules, one drawing ticket gets one picture, two drawing tickets get two pictures. If he wanted all the similar ones, he would need five drawing tickets. Finally, he got permission from the staff to give three drawing tickets, and the other two were considered complimentary.

When that man left his seat and went back satisfied, the Art Academy students, who seemed very tired but were still so beautiful, were already drawing portraits of another female guest without stopping.

Correction

In yesterday's Liu game, the 7th game, 15th move, Chariot 2 to 3 was incorrectly printed as to 2.

We sincerely apologize for the incorrect printing of the 11th game's "Winning the Lottery" with the "Three-Way Red Army" as "Seven-Way Black Army". In the 6th game, the edge horse on the first rank is a red horse, and in the 4th game, the 42nd move, Horse 9 retreats 7, was incorrectly printed as 8 retreats 7. In the 3rd game, the 27th move, Cannon 8 advances 2, was incorrectly printed as advances 2.

In the explanation of the opening of the first game, the fourth sentence, "Black's Chariot 9 to 8" should be changed to "Red's". In the same game, the ninth sentence "(Even if the Red Chariot restricts the horse on the third rank)" should be changed to "Black Chariot". Also, in the 4th game, the 29th sentence, "(If Red's Pawn 7 advances)" should be changed to "Black's".

Beginner's Guide (Continued)

One of the methods of moving backwards is to place both feet flat on the ground, lean the body to the left, and apply force on the outer edge of the left foot (i.e., the outer two wheels). Apply force on the inner edge of the right foot (i.e., the inner two wheels). Use the right foot to push forward, forming an arc on the ground. After the right foot pushes forward, move it behind the left heel, keeping both feet on the ground. At this point, lean the body to the right, apply force on the inner edge of the left foot, and apply force on the outer edge of the right foot. Use the left foot to push forward, also forming an arc on the ground. After the left foot pushes forward, move it behind the right heel. Repeat these steps alternately left and right to continue moving backwards. When moving backwards, the two feet form arcs on the ground as shown in the diagram below:

Another method of moving backwards is to stand firmly first, keep the body straight and slightly leaning back, point both feet inward, so that the two feet form a figure eight. Bring the two knees together, and apply force on the inner edges of both feet simultaneously (i.e., the inner two wheels), pushing them outwards and then pulling them back together. When pulling them back together, slightly lift the heels. After pulling them back together, point the toes inward again, apply force on the inner edges (inner wheels), and push outwards.

When the practice of moving backwards becomes pure and smooth, lift one of the pushing feet, and you can move backwards independently on one foot.

When moving backwards, the main foot must be in front of the guest foot's toes before it lands. When the toes leave the ground, wait for the main foot to move back and land, then use the guest foot to push forward with force. At the same time, lean the whole body backwards, and when the main leg starts to move, bend it first and then straighten it.

Method of Changing from Forward to Backward Beginners who can already stand and move forward may want to know how to change direction. At this time, you must pay attention to the following two points: (1) When turning, the most important thing to avoid is jumping with your feet suddenly; (2) Both feet are subject to the command of the body, not the other way around. Therefore, when changing direction, you must first turn the whole body, and then the two feet will follow.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Peking Opera World of the Former Capital (89)

— Xu Muyun

Li Da Wu was a famous sharp-tongued person.

People in Beijing understand every word in the Peking Opera. Even if someone is scolding you, how can you use harsh words to hurt them? Mei Rongzhai hesitated a bit, and then he had no choice but to sulk. This led to a great disaster, and he didn't perform for many days. It wasn't until Liu Hongxiang became popular that he helped him perform in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Long Changsheng's name could be said to be known throughout the country. However, when he first performed in Beijing, his appeal was not good. At that time, he was performing in a certain park, and his daily salary was fifty strings of cash (insiders call the salary "carriage money"). At that time, it couldn't be considered a small amount. One day, he was scheduled to perform "Dingjun Mountain," with Long playing Huang Zhong and Li playing Yan Yan. That day, the audience was very sparse, with only a few dozen people in total. Seeing that it was getting dark, and several people had dinner appointments (people in Beiping called having social engagements "having a dinner appointment"), they left early. The performers on stage felt even more embarrassed. When Boss Long came on stage in the eleventh scene, he changed the original line "The great general is majestic on all sides" to the short sentence "Watching the red sun set." One reason was that the audience was small and he was very unhappy. Another reason was that there were so few people in front of the stage, making it difficult to put on a good performance, and he felt that he had no majesty at all. So Boss Long just casually grabbed a line. But he didn't know that the Li Da Wu, who was playing Yan Yan, was a famous sharp-tongued person. Even if others didn't provoke him, he would find a way to annoy people. Moreover, today, Long Changsheng himself had started it by changing the original line and turning the "Zhongdong" rhyme into a "Suobo" rhyme, as if he was deliberately making things difficult for him. You can imagine how the unforgiving Li Bad-Mouth could not mock Boss Long? He was a natural wit and immediately changed his original line "Winning the battle at Tiandang Mountain" to "Carriage money exceeds the seats." When Boss Long heard this, his face turned red, and he realized how foul his mouth was. This really ridiculed him thoroughly. Afterwards, he became aware of the situation and paid attention to him. Although Long Changsheng was not driven away by him, he was not very successful for a long time. It wasn't until later when he joined Sixi and was supported by Xi Juxian that he became famous, and every performance was full. Although Li Wu had a bad mouth, he also knew how to admire people with real talent. He always worked well with Lao Tan when they performed together. If Long Changsheng hadn't started messing with him first, he would never have joked with the talented Boss Long. As the saying goes, "There is always someone better, and there is always a sky beyond the sky." It can be seen that it was not easy to perform Peking Opera in Beijing in the past. It was precisely because the opera profession was not easy to make a living from that there were so many good performers. Nowadays, as long as someone supports them, they dare to go on stage in two or three years, and they have never suffered any hardships anywhere. May I ask, is such a performance still worth watching?
