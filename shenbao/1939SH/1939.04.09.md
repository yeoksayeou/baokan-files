Editorial

### Why Did Italy Invade Albania?

While Hitler's eastward expansion policies are repeatedly successful and the Eastern European collective security organization under Chamberlain's leadership is still in progress, Mussolini, under the intertwining of envy and fear, launched the invasion of Albania. In a speech he delivered late last month, Mussolini already hinted at ambitions in the Mediterranean. At the beginning of this month, he made two unreasonable demands on the Albanian government: long-term stationing of troops and expansion of colonial quotas, using an ultimatum to coerce a response. Although Albania has always been a semi-dependent state of Italy, it felt that the fundamental survival of the country was at stake and could not tolerate this demand for national subjugation, so it resolutely refused. King Zog I issued an emergency order to prepare for resistance. As such, the Italian navy began attacking Albanian ports such as Durazzo and Valona on the morning of the 7th of this month. In just one and a half days, all major ports in Albania were occupied, but the Albanian government did not lose heart and continued to resist. Currently, the war is unfolding in the mountainous inland areas.

Albania is the smallest country in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula, with an area of over 27,000 square kilometers, only a quarter of Jiangsu Province in China, and a population of just over one million, equivalent to a single city of Nanjing in China. However, its location is between Greece and Yugoslavia, guarding the gateway to the Adriatic Sea and being a key point for Central Europe to access the sea from the south. Therefore, from the perspective of controlling the Balkan Peninsula or the Mediterranean, it is a strategically important area. Italy and Albania are separated by only a narrow strip of water, and the direction of Italian imperialism's development is the Balkan Peninsula on land and the Mediterranean at sea. Therefore, Albania became the target of its aggression. If Italy places Albania under its control, it not only passively eliminates a major threat on the opposite side of the Adriatic Sea but also actively gains an important base for dominating the Mediterranean and aspiring to the Balkans. Therefore, after Mussolini came to power, he harbored unlimited ambitions towards Albania. In November 1916, Italy and Albania signed the so-called Treaty of Tirana (the Albanian capital). The following year, in the same month, the two countries concluded a military alliance with a term of twenty years. Thus, Albania was already a protectorate of Italy in fact, and all sectors, including politics and economy, had close ties with Italy. Since Italy effectively controlled Albania, why now launch a massive campaign, attempting to conquer Albania by force? According to the Italian government's self-promotion, Italy requested Albania to revise the 1927 military alliance treaty, and anti-Italian demonstrations occurred in Albania, endangering the safety of Italian expatriates. Therefore, Italy had to use force to subdue the country. This is originally a set of aggression theories spoken in unison by aggressors around the world and has no credible value. In fact, since the Polish question arose, it forced democratic countries such as Britain and France to move towards collective security, with the possibility of encircling the German-Italian axis. Therefore, Italy was eager to cross the Adriatic Sea, attempting to firmly occupy Albania to gain a foothold in the Balkans, prevent contact between the small states in the north and south, and at the same time directly exert pressure on its closest neighbors, Yugoslavia and Greece, to prevent them from joining the Eastern European collective security organization. This is one of Mussolini's true reasons. Furthermore, what Italy cannot forget is to become the master of the Mediterranean. According to reports from London and Paris, Mussolini's plan is to occupy all the strategically important points of the Mediterranean, such as British-owned Gibraltar and French-owned Morocco. This time, the Albanian incident can be said to be the initial manifestation of Italy's ambitions in the Mediterranean. In short, Italy's invasion of Albania is a concrete manifestation of Italy's dual ambitions in the Balkans and the Mediterranean and is also an important move in the tactical maneuvering of the fascist front to deal with the democratic front.

However, things are not that simple. Italy's invasion of Albania also exposed the inherent contradictions of the fascist front. In other words, the opposition between Germany and Italy will become even more acute from now on. Originally, Italy has been operating in Albania at a huge cost, and its main purpose is to deal with Yugoslavia. Because the Dalmatian region along the coast of Yugoslavia and the port of Kotor are both extremely coveted by Italy, so with Italy having a foothold in Albania, southern Yugoslavia will become something it can easily seize. Yugoslavia was originally the most fortunate country after the European War. Most of its land in the north was the old territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After Germany's recent large-scale expansion of power in Central Europe, it has the possibility of using the issue of the ruled ethnic groups to carry out conspiracies against Yugoslavia, and even finding a seaport on the Adriatic Sea is not a fantasy. Germany's ambitions in the Balkans are certainly a threat to democratic countries such as Britain and France, but they are particularly painful for Italy. Therefore, this time, Italy's invasion of Albania, in addition to the aforementioned purpose, also has a subtle effect: attempting to strengthen control over Yugoslavia, prohibiting it from having any connection with any party, including Germany. It is rumored that Italy has offered guarantees to Yugoslavia, even if Germany attacks, Italy will do its best to protect it, in exchange for Yugoslavia's strict neutrality in the Albanian incident. It can be seen from this that the internal contradictions between Germany will unfold due to the Albanian question.

The Albanian army and people are currently fighting hard against violence, willing to shed their last drop of blood. Although countries such as Britain and France have not yet expressed active support, this incident is undoubtedly a touchstone for whether a collective security organization can be established. We believe that the longer the Albanian resistance lasts, the more it can truly consolidate the democratic front. At that time, the contradictions within the invading countries themselves will conversely continue to increase, and the result may be that they will suffer the evil consequences of self-destruction!

Recently, the seventh incursion into Zhongtiao Mountain by the Japanese was met with a courageous counterattack by the Hua army and has ended in failure. The details are as follows: The Japanese troops entrenched in the Yinnan triangle launched a large-scale offensive into Zhongtiao Mountain from Hanyang, Yu County, Yuncheng, Anyi, Xia County, and other places, starting on the 28th of last month, attempting to break through the Hua army in one fell swoop with a multi-pronged attack. The Japanese troops from Hanyang and Yu County, after capturing Hua's Ruicheng, joined forces with the Japanese troops from Jie County on the 30th to attack Monan, engaging in fierce fighting with the Hua army in Dagou Nan. The Hua army, in order to lure the enemy in deep, voluntarily retreated to Xiaogou Nan. The Japanese troops then launched a fierce attack with aircraft and artillery, but the Hua army resisted to the death, and a powerful unit circled around the flanks and rear of the Japanese troops from Yuecun, launching a fierce attack from both sides, killing a large number of Japanese troops. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, fled in disarray towards Monan Town. The Hua army, taking advantage of the momentum of victory, launched a resolute pursuit and captured Monan on the first and recovered Ruicheng on the second. The Japanese troops fled back to their lairs. The Japanese troops in Anxia initially launched a partial offensive east from Wangyu Kou, which failed. They then launched an offensive south from Zhangdian Town, engaging in fierce fighting with the Hua army at Fengxie Kou and Shuncun, with repeated charges and counter-charges, more than ten times. The Japanese troops ultimately failed to achieve their objectives. On the 31st of last month, the Hua army in that area suddenly shifted to the offensive, routing the Japanese troops facing them in one fell swoop and pursuing them fiercely. The Japanese were nearly routed and fled in two directions through Dachen Cun and Yangchao, towards Zhangdian Town and the north of Baishu Cen and Wujia Gou. The Hua army then recovered Yangchao, Niucun, Baishu Cen, Wujia Gou, and other places. In total, in this campaign, the Hua army shot down one Japanese aircraft and killed over 1,500 Japanese troops.

The Japanese soldiers, caught off guard, concentrated their firepower for a fierce attack. Another unit of ambushing troops on the Hua high ground also opened fire with machine guns. The Japanese soldiers were caught in a crossfire and were unable to deploy for combat. Corpses were scattered across the field. The Japanese troops in Dawu, upon hearing the alarm, sent over 300 reinforcements, and the Japanese blockhouses also opened fire to assist. The Hua army, having achieved its objective of annihilation, quickly and safely withdrew from the battlefield. It is estimated that over sixty Japanese soldiers were killed, including Shirai Magosaburo, the commander of the Third Machine Gun Company of the Ninth Infantry Regiment, deputy commanders Yoneji Shiumei Jiro, as well as Nakafuji Hachizo, Tanemoto Tsurukichi, and others.

Japanese General Sugi arrived in Jiexiu a few days ago to plot this conspiracy. At the end of last month, the Japanese troops in Pingyao re-occupied Dongquan Town (twenty miles southeast of the city). The Japanese troops in Jiexiu advanced east to Guzhai, with a combined force of 4,000-5,000 troops, attacking Wanghe Town in five routes on the third. The Hua army bravely blocked the attack along the Wanghe, Wangtao, and Ziping (all north of Qinyuan) line, engaging in three rounds of bayonet charges. After fierce fighting for half a day, over 300 Japanese troops were killed. Subsequently, the Japanese troops frequently released poison gas, and many Hua army officers and soldiers were poisoned, so they shifted south to meet the attack. The Japanese troops in Hongdong, Fushan, and Anze all moved east towards Qixian, and the Japanese troops in Taiyuan moved towards Zihong Kou and Mailing Pass, attempting to join forces to attack Erqin (Qin County and Qinyuan). Japanese troops have been increased in Pindin, Heshun, and Jiezigou south of Zhengtai, as well as in Wu'an, Zhi County, and Hui County in northern Henan. Over 2,000 Japanese troops have been added to Daoqing Qianqinghua and Qinyang. According to reports, the Japanese army's nine-pronged attack last spring was disastrous. This time, with another incursion, it will undoubtedly be crushed by the Hua army. (Seventh Dispatch)

One route consisted of over 3,000 enemies, heading towards Dachen Village; another route consisted of over 2,000 enemies, attacking Monan Town; and another route consisted of over 1,000 enemies, attacking Nanchiu Village. Each route had enemy aircraft assisting in the attack, attempting to seize important strongholds such as Lan Jindu and Pingguan, and were extremely active. Our army, relying on favorable terrain, launched fierce counterattacks, fighting back and forth. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented in recent months in this area. Dachen Village, Monan Town, and Nanchiu Village were lost and regained repeatedly. Ultimately, because our officers and soldiers fought bravely and bloody, the enemy's entire offensive was defeated and routed, and each of these places remained in our hands. In the battle of Dachen Village, the enemy suffered over 1,200 casualties, and an enemy aircraft was shot down in Nanchiu Village, with both the aircraft and its crew destroyed. The enemy's main force suffered such a major blow that it was almost completely sacrificed. Now, in various places in Pinglu, our army's morale is even stronger. In Yicheng in eastern Shanxi, Yangqu in western Shanxi, and Jingle in northern Shanxi, our enemy armies also engaged in repeated fierce fighting. The enemy army attacked us in several routes with thousands of men. Under our brave resistance, the enemy was heavily damaged and fled. Most of the enemy troops in Jingle fled to Xinxian County, which we have been fiercely besieging until noon on the fourth. We once stormed into the city. The remaining enemy troops, stubbornly resisting in the city, are no more than a few hundred and will not be difficult to clear.

Hubei-Hunan Front: On both banks of the Xiang River in central Hubei, our enemies are still facing each other across the river, with sporadic artillery battles occurring. The enemy occupying Nanhe Du in Hanchuan was counterattacked by us on the first and defeated, with the remaining enemies retreating back to Hanchuan, and we recovered the area. On the same day, the enemy in Yuekou attacked Luo Jia Dian and Henglin Kou in the evening, but was bravely repelled, with over a hundred enemies killed. Another unit of the enemy attempted to cross the Zhang Jia Dian river stealthily, but was heavily attacked by our army, with the enemy suffering heavy casualties and fleeing to Zhongxiang. Our army then captured Zhou Wang Zhuang Temple and other key points. Three days later, we stormed into the city, killing a large number of enemy troops. In southern Hubei, a unit of our army captured Qigu Mountain on the same day, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In northern Hunan, our army captured Xin Kai Tang near Yueyang on the third. The enemy suffered heavy losses and sent a large number of reinforcements this week to launch a fierce counterattack. After several days of fierce fighting, we achieved a great victory, killing over 2,000 enemy troops. Currently, there are no enemy traces in Xin Kai Tang, Ma Tang, and other places. Our army took advantage of the victory to advance, directly approaching the suburbs of Yueyang, and are jointly besieging the county seat. The remaining enemies are still stubbornly resisting, and the battle is extremely fierce.

Henan Front: The fighting was more intense in the Xinyang area. Our army besieged the county seat on three sides last week, cutting off the enemy's retreat. This week, the enemy sent 1,000-2,000 reinforcements, with many artillery pieces and aircraft, to launch a counterattack in several routes. The two sides engaged in unprecedented fierce fighting in Luotuo Dian, Shizi Po, You River, and other places near the county seat. After suffering losses, the enemy released poison gas indiscriminately, but failed to succeed. Currently, the strongholds in the four suburbs of the city are still in our hands, and all traffic in all directions has been completely cut off by us. The enemy stubbornly resisting in the city is in a dead end. As for the enemy in eastern Henan, this week they joined forces with the puppet army of Cao Xichen to attack Luyi in the west, but were counterattacked by us, with over 200 enemy and puppet officers and soldiers killed. Over a hundred people, including the puppet army leader Cao Xichen, were captured. The enemy of four or five hundred in Yuanwu, northern Henan, used artillery fire to cover their advance to the southwest on the morning of the first, engaging in fierce fighting with us in the area east of Zhan Dian. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and fled back along the same route that night. There has been no movement so far. Also, the enemy in San Liuzhai forced civilians to block the breach, but on the morning of the second, they were bravely attacked by our army, and everyone responded and attacked from inside and outside, killing a large number of enemies. The enemy appeared to be fleeing east.

In addition, (1) In the Tongling and Qingyang areas of southern Anhui, the fighting between our enemy armies is still very fierce. The strongholds of Zengxing Shan, Paifang Shan, and Chengjia Da Shan have all been recaptured. Another unit of our army attacking Wanzhi and Jiuli Shan has occupied the enemy's first line of defense and is now continuing to advance. (2) The Jiangnan area our army, launched attacks on Yixing in several routes in recent days, has recovered Hu Jun and Ren Mountain, and has now reached the suburbs of the city and is stepping up the siege. (3) In Suiyuan Province, over a thousand enemy infantry, cavalry, and artillery divided into three routes from Baotou, Salaqi, and Guyang at dawn on the 31st to attack our army in Daqingshan. Our army used the natural dangers to launch a timely attack, killing over 500 enemies. They are still facing off against each other. (Fifth Dispatch)

### Competing for Control of the Mediterranean; Opposition Among European Powers Becomes More Apparent; Italy's Armed Invasion of Albania Undermines the Anglo-Italian Agreement; London and Paris Diplomatically Active

(London) A diplomatic reporter for the Mancester Guardian stated that the German-Italian plan to dominate the Mediterranean is gradually becoming apparent. At present, Italy has now controlled the central part of the Mediterranean, and Germany and Italy are consolidating their position in Spain, which they had already occupied before Franco's victory. Germany and Italy have obtained strongholds in Majorca, Spanish Morocco, and various Spanish ports, and with their growing power, they are guiding the pro-fascist movement, and will strive for control of the western Mediterranean. At the same time, Germany, with its rapid advance to the southeast and its efforts to seek political and economic influence in Yugoslavia, and Italy, with its actions in Albania, are preparing to establish a superior position in the eastern Mediterranean. In exchange, Italy's victory in Albania will inevitably affect Yugoslavia, Greece, and Romania. Today, to say that Italy's actions will not change the status quo in the Mediterranean is simply ridiculous. Therefore, Italy's actions have undermined the Anglo-Italian agreement, and the British government must pay close attention to Mussolini as it does to Hitler. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch) (London) Britain and France are currently exchanging views on Italy's sudden invasion of Albania. Britain recognizes Italy's united front, so it is difficult to take effective retaliatory action against Italy for the time being. (Eighth Associated Press Dispatch)

(London) British officials now feel that a judgment on the situation in Albania can only be made after the situation has crystallized and official reports have been considered. However, it is noteworthy that the Italian government informed the British government on April 4 that it had no intention of changing the status quo in Albania, and that the Italian government's plan to enhance Italian-Albanian relations, which it had submitted to the Albanian government through ordinary diplomatic channels, did not contain any elimination of Albanian sovereignty, integrity, or independence. British Foreign Secretary Halifax is currently staying in London to closely monitor the situation, and it is heard that other cabinet members have not traveled far from London either. Those who visited the British Foreign Office today included the ambassadors of France and Turkey, the envoys of Romania, Greece, Albania, and Poland, and the Italian chargé d'affaires. (Seventh Reuters Dispatch)

(Paris) After the Albanian incident, the French government has been extremely active diplomatically. Ambassador Corbin to England held talks with British Undersecretary Cadogan, and then reported the progress to Foreign Minister Bonnet by long-distance telephone. The Foreign Minister also met separately with British Ambassador to France Phipps, Polish Ambassador Lukasiewicz, Turkish Ambassador Suad, US Ambassador Bullitt, Soviet Ambassador Suritz, and Yugoslav Envoy Buhe 区 to discuss the Albanian incident. Those responsible have recently stated that Italy's actions have violated the Anglo-Italian agreement of April 16, 1938. The United Kingdom has a greater vested interest than France. What is the intention of that government? It is still unknown, but it can be asserted that it will not be passive. However, the mutual assistance agreement recently concluded with Poland, as well as the agreements negotiated with Romania and the Soviet Union, do not apply to Italy's current actions. This is also the actual situation. (Seventh Havas Dispatch)

(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain will return to London from Scotland to decide whether to immediately guarantee the security of Greece, thereby proving that Britain is faster to react to events than all other powerful countries. After the establishment of an agreement between Britain and Greece, Britain may need to use Greek seaports, such as Corfu, to facilitate naval operations. This is also possible. (Eighth Havas Dispatch)

(Rome) Rumors are circulating that the British fleet will occupy Corfu, southwest of Albania and not far from the Greek coast, but this news has not been confirmed as of noon today. It is the key point of the exit of the Adriatic Sea. It is said that the island was once forcibly occupied by Italy in 1923. Will the British fleet preempt it? It is said that two teams of the British Mediterranean Fleet arrived near Corfu yesterday to occupy the island, although it has not been confirmed. (Eighth Haitong Dispatch)

### Anti-Aggression Group Organization; British MP Asks Whether the Government Will Invite China to Participate

(London) When the House of Commons reconvenes on the 19th, Labour MP Henderson will ask Prime Minister Chamberlain whether the government intends to invite China and other countries in the Far East to join any anti-aggressor countries. On the same day, Labour MP Davies will ask Shakespeare, the parliamentary commissioner of the Admiralty, whether he can inform the House of Commons in detail about the information he has received that Japan is now planning to build and install 18-inch guns. He will also ask the government whether it will change the plans of new warships set by the Admiralty as a result. (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)

### British Cabinet Meeting to Discuss How to Deal with the Current Situation

(London) The cabinet held a meeting at 11:00 this morning at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. Prime Minister Chamberlain had not yet returned to London and was replaced by Finance Minister Simon as chairman. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Minister for Coordination of Defense Chatfield, Air Minister Wood, War Minister Hore-Belisha, Naval Minister Stanhope, Home Secretary Hoare, and Lord Privy Seal Anderson all attended. Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately reported on diplomacy, explaining the international situation and reading reports sent by envoys stationed in the Balkan countries. It is heard that the Foreign Secretary said that Yugoslavia is unlikely to react to Italy's invasion of Albania. The Foreign Office has already instructed Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine to ask the Italian government whether this action can be reconciled with the international obligations it has accepted, since it participated in the Ambassadorial Conference in 1921 and agreed to guarantee Albania's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and also signed an agreement with Britain on April 16 last year agreeing to respect the status quo in the Mediterranean. What is being done now is inevitably in conflict with it. All cabinet members expressed their unanimous agreement. (Eighth Havas)

### Albanian Soldiers and Civilians Resist Aggression with Blood; City Falls Due to Numerical Disparity; Plan to Lure Enemy into the Mountains to Launch Guerrilla Warfare

(Rome) The semi-official Stefani News Agency has just issued a message stating that Italian troops entered Tirana, the capital of Albania, at 9:30 AM today. (Eighth Havas Dispatch)

Tirana: According to official sources here, the security forces and volunteers of Albania are resisting the Italian army with blood to defend the integrity of the country. Fierce battles are underway. (Eighth Haitong Dispatch)

(Paris) According to news obtained by French diplomatic circles last night, King Zog is now planning to retreat his troops to the mountains to wage a long-term guerrilla war against Italy. The Albanian parliament met all day yesterday and unanimously rejected Italy's ultimatum, insisting on defending the country. (Eighth Associated Press Dispatch)

Albanian Capital: Semi-official sources here recently issued a message stating that after 180 Italian warships attacked our major ports, the ports of Santi, Han de, Medua, Durazzo, Valona, and Santi Gamin Da have fallen one after another. Our troops have now retreated inland and continue to resist. Italian troops attacked the port of Durazzo as many as seven times and landed three times, penetrating as far as the vicinity of the city hall, before being repelled by our troops. Later, the Italian side mobilized fresh troops and launched another attack under heavy artillery fire. Due to the disparity in numbers, our troops had no choice but to retreat with pain. The intensity of the resistance can be seen from this. (Seventh Havas Dispatch)

Albanian Capital: King Zog I issued a statement to the people yesterday, saying, "The government of Italy, regardless of years of diplomatic relations and in violation of current articles, made various demands on our country the other day. All of their terms are destructive to our independence, harmful to our sovereignty, and depriving us of our freedom. After careful consideration, I and the government authorities believe that there is no room for acceptance in order to maintain the status of the country. This country has now resorted to force, and all of our people should work together to overcome national difficulties in order to defend the motherland, maintain independence, and vow to resist until the last drop of blood. Although our country has a small population, it has been known for its bravery since ancient times. At this critical moment of survival, all people with blood and energy must be loyal, brave, and resolute, carry forward the national spirit, unite sincerely, resist foreign aggression together, and eventually receive help from heaven. This is what I firmly believe. The times are urgent and the enemy is deep, and I sincerely hope that the people of the whole country will be of one mind and one heart to serve the country. Long live Albania! Long live the Albanian people!" (Eighth Havas Dispatch)

Albanian Capital: The information department recently issued a statement to the people of the whole country and the Italian nation by radio today, using it to fiercely criticize the policies promoted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating that this policy will cause the Italian people to bleed and the country to be on the verge of bankruptcy. Now, it is attacking a small country with a million people with a large country with 40 million people, sacrificing the lives of young people in order to carry out imperialistic attempts. It should be known that this small country has always valued independence and sovereignty, and will never easily succumb without resisting to the last drop of blood. "Mussolini recently commented on the country of Czechoslovakia, saying, 'If a civilized country does not know how to resist the coming of foreign troubles, then I dare to assert that the time for this country to change its fate has matured.' The Albanian nation now takes this slogan of Mussolini as a creed. Not only the men, but also the women and children of the whole country, are willing to re-express their heroic spirit to the civilized world during this national crisis." (Seventh Havas Dispatch)

### Italy's Air Force Indiscriminately Bombs; Albanians Fight Bravely with National Unity

After Italy launched a combined sea, land, and air attack on the Albanian coast, the Albanian capital Durazzo, Vlorë, Shengjin, and other places were attacked. Although the Albanian army was outnumbered by the Italian army, they resisted bravely. The Albanian government has acknowledged that the above locations fell yesterday at 4:00 PM. The Albanian soldiers who died in the battle numbered 140, with hundreds wounded. The Italian army suffered 25 dead and 60 wounded. It is reported that before the Italian army captured Durazzo, they were repelled four times by the Albanians. Afterward, the Italian navy and air force carried out extensive bombing before they successfully landed. The reason why the Albanians could not effectively stop the Italian landing was due to the poor equipment of the Albanian army. The Albanian government now plans to mobilize 120,000 reserve soldiers to attack the 30,000 Italian troops that have now invaded Albanian territory. However, according to neutral observers, the Albanian strategy should be to retreat into the deep mountains and engage in guerrilla warfare from there.

According to Italian radio broadcasts, the Albanians are still resisting. In some areas, Albanians retreating into the mountains are rolling boulders down from the mountain peaks to impede the Italian advance. However, the number of Albanian troops seems to be small, and they will not be difficult to eliminate in one fell swoop. Currently, only 12,000 Albanians are engaged in the resistance, including regular soldiers, as well as farmers, workers, and merchants who have risen up in revolt. At the same time, 30,000 Italian troops have already landed, and it is expected that the number will increase to 60,000 within 48 hours. According to an Italian announcement broadcast from Rome last night, Italian troops have advanced nine miles from Durazzo. Albanians resisting along the coast have been defeated. The Italian vanguard has advanced to a point fifteen miles from the Albanian capital. When the Albanians withdrew from Durazzo, they blew up the bridge over the Ishëm River, but this only temporarily hindered the Italian motorized units. According to Albanian sources, Durazzo and Vlorë were severely bombed, and Alessio was reduced to ashes. The bombing of Durazzo and Vlorë was carried out by the Italian navy, and countless civilians died in the attacks. Now, Albanian hunters and those with firearms have risen to fight, attempting to block the Italian army's rapid advance on the Albanian capital. Even children are throwing bricks at the Italian troops. Italian bombers are now largely providing cover for the Italian advance, with some circling over the Albanian capital. (April 8th, Associated Press)

### Albanian King Flees the Capital; Situation Chaotic; Puppet Government to Be Organized Under Italian Protection

(Rome) A semi-official message received here this morning from the Albanian capital states, "After King Zog I, along with his family and government ministers, left the capital last night, the city was thrown into a state of panic. Armed prisoners released from prisons are indiscriminately firing, and this has not stopped as of dawn this morning. The royal palace has been looted, and the safety of the Italian legation is also threatened. The Albanian government's gendarmes stationed in front of the legation have now left. The city was ordered to maintain order last night by Italian officer Colonel Stanatis, who arrested many troublemakers and made every effort to maintain telegraph and telephone communications." (April 8th, Huitong Telegram)

(Rome) The Italian official news agency reports that the Italian envoy to Albania and other Italian officials are all in the legation, directing armed Italians to arrange defenses and prepare to defend themselves against accidents. Rioters, who were armed a few days ago and attacked Italian expatriates, are now engaged in looting in Tirana. King Zog has left the Albanian capital and his whereabouts are unknown. After the king left, gunfire was heard from time to time in the Albanian capital, especially near the Italian legation. Yesterday at dawn, many cars, mixed with Red Cross ambulances, filled with valuable objects, drove from Tirana to Elbasan. King Zog is now planning to conduct diplomatic negotiations with the Italian commander-in-chief in order to stop the Italian military actions in Albania. It is expected that a provisional government will soon be organized by responsible individuals, and Albania will be placed under Italian guidance. (April 7th, Reuters)

### Albanian Queen and Newborn Flee to Greece

Athens - Queen Geraldine of Albania (age 19), who gave birth to a prince just on the 4th of this month, was still in bed when the Italian army invaded Albania. She immediately fled with her two-day-old infant to Salonika, Greece, where she is being cared for by two Greek doctors. At the same time, two of King Zog's sisters have also fled to Salonika. (April 8th, Huitong Telegram)

### World Muslims Unanimously Indignant; Determined to Support Albania

(London) The Executive Committee of the Pan-Arab Association held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to review the impact of the Albanian incident on Muslims (Albania has a population of over one million, of whom Muslims account for three-fifths). A resolution was immediately passed, stating that if Albania resists to the end, all Muslims will provide assistance. (April 8th, Havas Telegram)

Beirut, Syrian Republic - After the news of the Italian invasion of Albania spread, Muslims in various countries in the Near East were greatly shocked and extremely indignant. (April 8th, Havas Telegram)

### A Brief History of Albania

Albania is located on the western coast of the Balkan Peninsula, bordering northern Greece. It has a population of 1.5 million. Before 1912, it was part of the Turkish Empire. The country is mostly mountainous and almost entirely undeveloped. The mountains have high-quality forests, and wine and olive oil are the main products. The people mostly raise cattle in the plains and sheep in the mountains. The main cities are Scutari, Berat, Janina. The people of the country belong to one of the oldest races in the Balkan Peninsula and are known for their strong independence and adherence to old customs. Most are Muslims, with the remaining two-fifths either Greek Orthodox or Catholic. The town of Durazzo is the ancient Roman town of Dyrrhachium, a prosperous port in Roman times. Albania has been under foreign rule for centuries, first belonging to the Goths, then ruled by Serbians, Normans, Sicilians, and Turks. The Albanian people are rich in the spirit of independence, and although sovereignty was lost for a long time, they attempted independence several times in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries without success. In 1913, after the end of the Balkan Wars, the Treaty of London granted independence. Italy's first act of aggression against Albania occurred in December 1914, citing the pretext of Austria's expansion of power in Serbia and sending troops to Vlorë on the Albanian coast to resist it. The 1915 agreement secretly promised Albania to Italy as part of the reward for Italy's participation in World War I. The Albanian monarch was unaware of this and agreed to grant Vlorë sovereignty to Italy and allow Italy freedom of action in Albania in order to seek Italy's neutrality. Subsequently, the Italians withdrew from Durazzo but continued to occupy Vlorë, thereby controlling southern Albania. The 1919 San Remo Conference finally placed Albania under Italian trusteeship. In 1927, Italy and Albania concluded a treaty of friendship and arbitration. In 1928, the Albanian Constitutional Assembly proclaimed a civil monarchy, and Ahmed Zogu was given the title of King of Albania. King Zog I is the only monarch in Europe who has converted to Islam. He was born on October 8, 1895, and studied at a Turkish military academy. As an adult, he managed his father's property and, due to feudal traditions, the people obeyed the leader of the Zogu clan, allowing him to control thirteen tribes. The king embraced nationalism and had great ambitions, so he soon became involved in local politics. In 1912, Albania joined the Balkan Wars to resist Turkey, and the king served in the Western army, eventually winning Albania's independence. After Albania declared independence, Prince William of Wied was made its monarch in 1914. The king and William were close friends, so he was one of his right-hand men. During the war, the king joined the new nationalist opposition party. Soon after, he conspired with the party to stage an uprising against the monarch. As World War I broke out, the king joined the Austrian army and led a large contingent to resist the Italian army. After the end of the war, Italians, Yugoslavs, and Albanian nationalists competed to claim this small country. The king returned from Vienna and led the Albanians to reject foreign troops on the border. In 1924, the king once fled as a political fugitive, then regrouped his comrades in Belgrade and invaded Albania in January 1925, proclaiming the restoration of nationalism. His troops were invincible wherever they went, and after the success, he was elected as the first president of the Republic of Albania. In 1928, he was unanimously elected by the National Assembly and assumed the title of king. (Reuters)

### The Pitiful Fate of a Weak Nation; America Expresses Deep Sympathy; Acts of Aggression are Inexcusable; No Trustworthiness on Either Side of the Axis

(Washington) Reliable sources say that the United States will refuse to recognize the occupation of Albania. Italy's unjustified aggression should shatter the illusions of some who believe that concessions can be used to entice one side of the Axis to break away. Neither side of the Axis has trustworthiness and both are aggressive in nature, being cut from the same cloth. This is especially evident in light of current events. Although Britain is working to organize an anti-aggression bloc, it is believed here that efforts are still needed to achieve this goal. (April 7th, Reuters)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull spent a long time at Warm Springs today discussing the current situation regarding the Italian invasion of Albania with President Roosevelt. It is reported that they discussed the possible impact of this event on US relations with Italy and Albania. (April 7th, Reuters)

(Washington) After the incident in Albania, observers here all said that the US government would certainly condemn this Italian outrage, but would not necessarily take concrete action. American public opinion was originally very indignant, and was even more resentful because Italy's actions took place on Good Friday. The Albanian king and queen, both young and beautiful, have always been praised by Americans. The queen's mother is also from a prominent American family. The American public is therefore deeply sympathetic to the tragic fate of Albania. The country's expatriate community in the United States numbers around 40,000, and they had just celebrated the birth of the prince a few days ago. How could such a sudden change occur? The homeland has been invaded, King Zog I has hastily left the capital, and the queen has fled to a foreign land. Their grief and indignation can be imagined. Albanian Minister to the United States, Koco Gliozheni, recently visited Secretary of State Hull for discussions. After his country's defeat in the war, his legation here is unwilling to allow the Italian embassy to take it over, just as Czech Minister Hurban did not hand over his embassy to the German embassy. Koco Gliozheni recently released a statement to the newspapers, saying, "Italians have many advantages and are worthy of being called a great nation. It is a pity that God did not give them a sense of chivalry. Our queen gave birth to a prince just a few days ago, and now she has had to leave her bed and flee to a foreign land with her two-day-old infant. The tragedy of the situation is beyond words. Italy, without provocation, uses aggression as a matter of course. The population ratio between the two countries is 40 to 1 (Italy has a population of 42 million, while Albania has just over one million). In terms of the size of military equipment, the ratio is 1,000 to 1. It is not surprising that an egg cannot stand against a stone. However, I fear that Italy may not be able to obtain lasting benefits, and its loss of honor is especially concerning. Would a wrestling champion challenge another wrestler, or would they bully a child? Is that what a brave man does? Our intellectual circles often want to cooperate closely with Italy in culture, economy, and politics on honorable terms, but that country now responds with a punch. It is truly heartbreaking."

### Pitiful Albania; No Help in Sight; Lack of Solidarity in the Entente; Italy Exploits the Opportunity

The capital of Yugoslavia - A radio message sent today from the Albanian capital appealed to generous and righteous people not to allow a small country with only one million people to be destroyed. (April 7th, Reuters)

(Paris) After Italy used force in Albania, individuals here familiar with the political situation in the Balkan Peninsula stated that the Italian government had informed the Yugoslav government of its wishes at any time. Yugoslavia may not have any reaction to this incident. The fact that the Italian government recently concentrated troops in the area near the Yugoslav border and has now completely withdrawn them shows that Italy has no worries. As for Albania's past circumstances, although Italy has repeatedly exerted pressure, attempting to control its ports so that it can completely control the Adriatic Sea in the event of war, King Zog I has always firmly refused. For self-defense, the Albanian government has contacted Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia separately. Among them, Greece has not accepted the proposal for jointly guaranteeing Albania's independent sovereignty. At the same time, the strength of the Balkan Entente has also been weakened due to Romania's difficult situation. Albania has been isolated and helpless, so Italy has taken advantage of the situation. This is seen as unavoidable. (April 7th, Havas Telegram)

### Germany Strongly Supports Italy's Invasion of Albania; Italy Implements Adriatic Policy; No Interference from Western Democracies

(Berlin) It is reported that Hitler and Mussolini had a long conversation before the Italian army launched its attack on Albania. It is reported that Hitler fully approved of Italy's invasion of Albania. (April 7th, Reuters)

(Berlin) Official circles here say that Western democracies have no interests in the Albanian sphere and that if they wish to interfere in the legally indisputable position and actions of the Axis powers, Germany will consider it incomprehensible or disapprove of it. (April 7th, Reuters)

(Berlin) The German "People's Newspaper" today published an article on the Italian-Albanian incident that clearly reflects the instructions of official circles, saying that Italy has a direct relationship with Albania, and that Italy's Adriatic policy is determined by its determination to maintain peace. Germany's support for Italy's actions in Albania can also be seen in this. (April 7th, Reuters)

### Italy's Long-Planned Annexation of Albania; Incited Political Turmoil Unsuccessfully; Incident Finally Erupts

Corfu, Greece - Although Italy's sudden seizure of Albania seems abrupt, the deterioration of relations between the two countries has not been a matter of days. Recently, well-informed sources here revealed its contents. It is claimed that in November 1938, General Giro, a representative of the Italian Fascist Party, went to Tirana on a mission to promote the Fascist system. This was opposed by King Zog I, who considered it inappropriate. General Giro stayed in the capital and notified the Italian Prime Minister of this intention. In January of this year, General Giro returned to Tirana on a secret mission, intending to exploit the divisions between the various political parties in Albania, incite a coup, and support Vlashi to oppose Zog I. Vlashi is the wealthiest man in Albania, and his daughter was once engaged to the king, but the engagement was suddenly broken off, causing Vlashi great resentment. In 1934, he colluded with someone named Kloya (who had lived in Italy for a long time) to plot against the king, but was unsuccessful. In February of this year, General Giro again plotted to depose Zog I and support Vlashi as king. However, his intentions were betrayed by a member of his party, who informed the king. The king was able to quell the disturbance in an instant, and many of the remaining members were arrested. General Giro and the Italian envoy hastily returned to their country. Later, at the strong request of the Italian government, Zog I released the rebels. Zog I had no choice but to release them and ordered them to leave the country immediately. These people fled to Italy. From then on, Italian-Albanian relations gradually deteriorated. Furthermore, because of the insatiable demands of the Italian government, relations became even worse, eventually leading to this incident. (April 8th, Havas Telegram)

(Rome) The Italian newspaper "Il Giornale d'Italia" today published an article by Gaida, stating that new and important events will now be achieved in Eastern Europe. Italy, because it has accepted the cries of patriotic Albanian people who can no longer endure the tyranny of their king, and because it has seen the necessity of protecting the lives and property of Italians in Albania from the open harm of armed mobs, has today sent troops to land in Albania, without encountering resistance, and is advancing towards various key points. In the past few days, King Zog I of Albania had requested the Italian government to provide new assistance and protection, and to send troops to defend certain parts of Albania. However, the Italian government later learned that Zog I intended to use Italian troops to attack Yugoslavia in order to disrupt the friendly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia, so it rejected his request. Zog I and others, whose plans were thwarted, turned to anger, and there were acts of violence against Italian expatriates in Albania. The Italian government asked Zog I to pay attention to his responsibilities, but the Albanian king avoided this issue and proposed new conspiracies with questionable intentions. Italy was therefore forced to intervene to restore the peace and order and civil liberties in Albania that had already been destroyed. This decision will not alarm neighboring countries, as Italy is eager to cooperate with all its neighbors to maintain peace in the Balkans and Europe. (April 7th, Reuters)

### Small Balkan Entente Countries All Anxious; Greece Worried, Yugoslavia Taking a Wait-and-See Approach; Romanian and Turkish Foreign Ministers Meet to Discuss Countermeasures

Athens - Greece borders Albania, so it is paying close attention to the Italian military invasion of Albania. However, as of this time, there has been no official statement explaining the government's attitude. (April 8th, Huitong Telegram)

Corfu, Greece (urgent telegram) - People here generally fear that Italy will take action against this island within a few days. (Note: After Italian General Tellini was killed by Greeks on August 27, 1923, Italy seized this island on the pretext of occupation. Later, through the mediation of the League of Nations, Greece paid 50,000,000 lire in compensation, and Italy withdrew its troops). (April 8th, Havas Telegram)

Yugoslav capital - Well-informed sources recently stated that the Yugoslav government will continue to take a wait-and-see attitude regarding the Albanian incident, referring to the 1937 Italo-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship to observe the development of the situation. At the same time, it is in close contact with Italy. The Italian government has also provided assurances that it is willing to respect Yugoslav interests and abide by the Treaty of Friendship.

Istanbul - Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here today aboard a Romanian warship. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and many other dignitaries came from the capital to welcome him and will conduct important talks with him. It is reported that Foreign Minister Gafencu's trip was decided after the Italian invasion of Albania. The Turkish cabinet convened a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of mutual guarantees between Romania and Turkey. (April 8th, Huitong Telegram)

(Paris) The trip of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu to Istanbul to hold talks with the Turkish Foreign Minister is highly valued by diplomatic circles here. It is said that the Balkan Entente countries (Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia) will decide how to respond to the threats from Germany and Italy during these talks. Among them, Romania is at the forefront of the German and Italian eastward expansion policy and must obtain the assistance of the Balkan Entente countries, especially Turkey, in order to resist effectively. It is even more crucial for Greece, Romania, and Turkey to strengthen cooperation with Bulgaria, depending on Turkey's attitude. (April 8th, Havas Telegram)

At the same time, Polish Foreign Minister Beck has asked British Prime Minister Chamberlain to contact Hungary. Beck believes that Hungarian Regent Horthy is unwilling to be a continuation of Austria. It is reported that Chamberlain has promised Hungary military assistance, on the condition that Hungary does not allow German troops to pass through its territory in the event of a European war. (April 8th, Associated Press)

(Berlin) The German government held a meeting today to discuss Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons regarding the Anglo-Polish agreement. German political circles do not conceal their satisfaction that Poland is clearly unwilling to contact the Soviet Union or strengthen its ties with Romania.

### German Troop Movements on Polish Border; Said to Be Rotation; Berlin Transit to Warsaw

(Berlin) Large numbers of German troops were moving in southwestern Berlin tonight, but German officials do not believe that this movement contains any international significance. The German troops included three army corps and mechanized units. A spokesman for the German Propaganda Ministry said, "We can guarantee that this movement does not have any ulterior motives. It is purely a local movement of troops, or troops being transferred back from Bohemia and Moravia." (April 7th, Associated Press)

(Berlin) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck passed through here this morning on the Nord Express. Polish Ambassador Lipski boarded the train to meet with him and reported on his talks with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday. (April 8th, Havas Telegram)

### Rumor That Germany Offered Guarantees to Poland; Territorial Integrity for Fifteen Years; Return of Danzig as Condition

(Berlin) According to reports, Germany has guaranteed Poland's complete independence and territorial integrity for fifteen years, and has requested the return of small, densely populated areas inhabited entirely by Germans, and free German access to the northeast as compensation. The "densely populated area" likely refers to Danzig. These detailed reports supplement the officially authorized statement issued on April 5, which involved recent German-Polish talks.

### Spain Joins Anti-Comintern Pact - Another Victory for Germany and Italy - No Less Than a Warning to Democratic Countries

Burgos - The Spanish government announced today its accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, stating that the government is currently surrounded by dangers on all sides and that this action is taken to strengthen the government's defensive position. The original proposal for joining the pact was signed in Burgos by Spanish Foreign Minister General Jordana, the German and Italian Ambassadors, and the Japanese Minister. (Reuters, 7th)

According to the contents of this agreement, it is divided into three items: (1) The Spanish National Government joins the Anti-Comintern Pact; (2) The method of cooperation between Spain and other signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact will be stipulated in a separate supplementary agreement; (3) This agreement is written in German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, and their legal value is the same. (Havas)

(Berlin) German newspapers, in their enthusiastic welcome of Spain's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, warned England and France. The National Daily News stated that if Western European countries make new attempts to impose new pressure on nationalistic Spain, the Anti-Comintern Pact countries will regard it as an unfriendly act and respond in an appropriate manner. (Reuters, 7th)

(Rome) After the Spanish National Military Government joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, political figures here praised it, saying that Spain's policy has always been oriented towards the Rome-Berlin Axis, but democratic countries still had various illusions about it. The country's resolute accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact is indeed a warning to democratic countries. Italy had previously persuaded Hungary to join, and now it has obtained Spain's permission to join, thus achieving another victory. (Havas, 7th)

### First Stage of Anti-Japanese War in Northern Jiangsu - Huaiyin Falls After the Fall of Donghai and Shuyang Counties - Chinese Troops Continuously Attacking Behind Japanese Lines - And Will Soon Coordinate with Guerrillas to Recover Various Counties

Taizhou Correspondence: Since the fall of Xuzhou, northern Jiangsu has been isolated. Relying on the calm response and hard work of the military and political authorities, they have managed to hold on. Although the Japanese army has repeatedly invaded, they have all been repelled head-on by the Chinese army. In mid-February, the Japanese army again drew troops from the Jinpu Railway line, piecing together bandit-puppet forces of Li Shouxin, Liu Guitang, etc., claiming to be three joint detachments, along with more than 30 tanks and armored vehicles and 7 aircraft (3 transferred from Xuzhou, 2 from Suqian airport, and 2 from Yangzhou airport), launching simultaneously from Haizhou, Guanyun, Shuyang, and Siyang, with the goal of capturing Huaiyin, the temporary provincial capital of Jiangsu. After the heroic defense of the troops in the Haizhou, Shuyang, Siyang, and Lianshui areas, bloody battles were fought, and fierce offensives were repeatedly frustrated. Finally, due to the intense artillery fire of the Japanese army, Donghai, Shuyang, Siyang, and Lianshui were successively abandoned. At this point, Huaiyin was surrounded by the Japanese army.

Huaiyin Falls, Wealth Plundered

The Japanese army entered Huaiyin city around 12:00 p.m. on March 2. Chinese troops had previously laid landmines at both ends of North Gate Street and poured gasoline all over the bridge surface, but unfortunately, before they could destroy it, the Japanese soldiers had already arrived, which was regrettable. The East Gate was destroyed by the Chinese army during the shift. Other military and political institutions such as the Huaiyin Power Plant, Dafeng Flour Mill, Huainong, Xinyingfang, and the Provincial Government Security Office were mostly destroyed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army entered the city through the North Gate, first with more than 10 tanks as a guide, patrolling back and forth on the road from the North Gate to the South Gate, and firing machine guns many times. Seeing no reaction, they stopped and gathered in front of the South City Park, establishing a temporary headquarters inside the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters. The next day, they moved to the former site of the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office. On the morning of the 3rd, Japanese soldiers searched everywhere, and closed all the city gates. More than a dozen local ruffians and scoundrels who recognized the enemy as their father flattered and led the way, looting the property of merchants and residents from door to door, using more than 20 loaded trucks to transport it all away. The post office on East Gate Street and the telegraph office on Hebei Ten Mile Long Street were closed by the Japanese military police. Most of the telegraph office personnel dispersed. Only the director, Zou Guoke, and a few employees gathered at the tea hermitage outside Beiyu to keep the machines, but there was no work to do. All the post office employees, on the morning of the 1st, sealed and used two civilian boats, and drove down the Grand Canal, planning to open in Baoying or Gaoyou to stand by. Unexpectedly, while passing through Huaian, they saw Japanese cavalry and tanks galloping on the highway, and machine guns were fired at both banks of the Grand Canal. Seeing this, the postal workers knew that they could not move forward, so they returned to Huaiyin. Now a temporary post office has been established outside Donggan. Director Deng Hongye leads all employees to receive and send letters and work as usual.

Planned Formation of a Puppet Association Failed

According to residents who escaped from the city, the number of Japanese soldiers was not very large. There were only about 100 stationed at Huaiyin Normal School, and about 30 at the county government and county party headquarters. Because the Japanese soldiers were afraid of attacks by the Chinese army, the garrison was often moved. There were even fewer soldiers stationed outside the city, only about 100 stationed near the airport in Xinyingfang. Japanese tanks and armored vehicles were all placed in the Tongyuan Bureau Commissioner's Office outside the city. The Japanese soldiers searched the Salvation Academy outside the West City and the Provincial Government across the river. Because the abandoned objects of each part were mostly taken away by the nearby unscrupulous people, the Japanese soldiers gained nothing and returned disappointed. After the commander of the Japanese troops, Kikukawa, arrived in Huaiyin, he ordered local villains to organize a puppet maintenance association, inviting Li Yushu, president of the Jisheng Association Qingjiang Branch, and Huang Zihou, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to serve as committee members. Li and others firmly refused to accept, because Huaiyin was still under the control of the Chinese army's counter-offensive troops, and the situation was uncertain, so it was abandoned.

Huaian and Baoying Suffer the Same Catastrophe

In Huaian, because the position is not as important as Huaiyin, there are even fewer Japanese soldiers stationed, less than 200 inside and outside the city. Huaicheng was the government seat during the late Qing Dynasty, and many officials and wealthy merchants started their families and prospered here. Their purses were full, and they spared no expense in material enjoyment. On the 2nd, after the county town fell into the hands of the Japanese army, the Japanese soldiers closed all the city gates and searched door to door. As for like utensils and clothing supplies, etc., following the Huaiyin method, they used more than 20 loaded trucks, going back and forth to Lianyungang, unloading them into transport ships, and shipping them back to Japan. This kind of behavior is really no different from piracy. Baoying County was once occupied, but it was very temporary. After the Chinese army's large-scale pressure, the Japanese soldiers fled back to Huaian. The people of Baodi have always been timid. Since the War of Resistance, they have never been visited by airplanes and bombs. On the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of this month, Japanese planes bombed Shiying, dropping no less than 100 bombs on the embankment along the canal and inside Baoying city. Merchants and residents felt that the war had extended to them, so they moved away one after another. After the Japanese soldiers entered the city, they plundered everything. Because the people evacuated in a hurry, except for gold, silver, and jewelry, like utensils and clothing were not taken away, so they were completely taken away by the Japanese soldiers. The amount of loss is no less than ten million. Since it was recovered by the Chinese army, merchants and residents who had avoided have returned one after another, and the market is gradually returning to normal.

Heroic Sacrifice in the Fierce Battle of Gaoyou

Gaoyou stands on the front line at the southernmost end of the Grand Canal. After the Chinese army retreated from Huaiyin and Huaian, it was caught between the enemy's front and back. Fortunately, the garrison 117th Division 697th Regiment and all parties in the party and government cooperated to stand firm in the midst of danger and shock. On the morning of March 10, the commander of the Japanese army in Yangzhou, Ogawa, transferred 900 to 600 Japanese soldiers, more than 100 horses, and 6 artillery pieces to invade the Zhaoguan Dam position of the Chinese army. From morning to dusk, they fired no less than 500 shells. At the same time, in the drizzle, they covered more than 20 speedboats and detoured around the west of Gaoyou Lake to attack the Lukin Chinese army position, implementing a winding attack. The Chinese defenders of Zhaoguan Dam were attacked from the front and back by the Japanese army, and they fell one after another, fighting bravely. Their heroic sacrifice was enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. However, Lukin was tight, so they had to abandon the Zhaoguan Dam position. Soon, reinforcements arrived. A certain battalion commander raised his arms and shouted, and the three armies gave their lives, fighting one against a hundred, and finally repelled the stubborn enemy and restored the position. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and 7 Japanese speedboats, 22 civilian boats, and more than 30 horses were destroyed. The next day, the Japanese army transported the bodies of the dead soldiers back to Yangzhou in small speedboats and large trucks, and cremated them outside Fuyunmen. The Japanese Army's Attempt is Equal to a Dream. Unexpectedly, after suffering this serious blow, the Japanese army's lucky heart was not completely dead. On the 11th and 12th, they continued to harass and bombard constantly. The Chinese army moved its troops to defend the new position of Lotus Pond, more than ten miles north of Zhaoguan Dam, because the Zhaoguan Dam position was destroyed by bombing and there was no danger to defend. The Chinese and Japanese armies confronted each other. The Japanese army repeatedly tried to build a highway to the north, but the Chinese army's security Zhang regiment sent teams to constantly attack and destroy it. Now Chinese reinforcements have arrived one after another to prevent the Japanese army from advancing again. Although Gaoyou is under the threat of Japanese airplanes and artillery, the officials and people are very calm. The shops are still open as usual, and the people are still working as usual, which is rare. Looking at the situation from all sides, the Japanese army's advance into northern Jiangsu originally attempted to open up the Grand Canal and then "sweep" northern Jiangsu, but it is equal to a dream. Now the Chinese army, such as Yu and Miao, are constantly attacking behind the Japanese army. Soon, the green gauze tent will rise, and the regular army will cooperate with the guerrillas to attack the Japanese army everywhere. The recovery of counties such as Zhunsi is really not a problem.

### Chinese Army in Suzhou Night Raid Zhouzhuang, Killing Twelve Japanese Soldiers

Suzhou Correspondence: Zhouzhuang Town, which belongs to the county, is surrounded by water on all sides and is a strategic point on the Suzhou-Shanghai waterway. The Japanese often stationed a large army in the town. Recently, due to the frequent tightness in Wuxi, Jiangyin and other places, the Japanese army transferred most of the soldiers in the town to Xicheng, leaving only more than 200 to garrison. Although the Japanese army relies on the surrounding bunkers and can defend firmly, it is ultimately due to the small number of people, which leads to a state of panic. On the 2nd of this month, it was learned by the Chinese mobile force stationed in Chenmu Town that the Japanese army was empty. That night, the team leader Wang Shaomin led soldiers × 100 people to attack the town, surrounding the Japanese army on all sides. The Japanese army immediately responded in a panic. Wang's troops lay in ambush in the fields, relying on natural protections to severely attack the Japanese army. The two sides fought fiercely for a night. When it dawned on the 3rd, the Japanese army was finally defeated and the town was occupied. The Japanese army's defenses were destroyed. Captain Wang led his troops back to Chenmu safely because the goal had been achieved. In addition to killing ten Japanese soldiers, three were captured. Wang's troops only lost one chief, Zhang Hongcai.

### Steel Raw Materials Worth Millions Are All Shipped to Japan

Songjiang Correspondence: The steel plant set up in the suburbs of Shanghai was invested by the government with millions of dollars. All the raw materials for steelmaking, estimated at more than 4,000 tons, were worth more than one million yuan. Since the Chinese army moved west, large and small barges were used to completely transport them all, and they were stored in the Yongye Crushed Stone Plant in Tianma Mountain, which belongs to Songjiang County. The preservation is very strict, and Tianma Mountain is located in a remote area, with only one or two rivers that can pass during high tide. On the land side, the roads are all narrow and winding paths within a dozen miles of the highway and railway, and heavy vehicles cannot travel. Therefore, transportation is inconvenient. Since Songjiang fell, in addition to occupying the important transportation strongholds along the Huangpu River and the railway and highway, the Japanese did not pay attention to Tianma Mountain and the surrounding villages and mountainous areas because the terrain was not important and the transportation was inconvenient, and they did not send troops to garrison. There are shameless people who saw the benefits and forgot the righteousness, and went to report to the Japanese army. On March 14, the Japanese sent a large team of Japanese troops to Songjiang to meet with 200 to 300 puppet troops from Songjiang. Han traitors led them to carry more than a dozen small speedboats, equipped with small steel cannons, heavy machine guns, and light machine guns, and went to Tianma Mountain. First, they searched the people. The security team stationed there was less than 100 people, and the difference between the number of people was too great to resist. Now the Japanese and puppet troops are stationed in the Yongye Crushed Stone Plant. First, they forcibly captured more than 100 ships from the people, and forcibly pulled hundreds of villagers, ordering the villagers to transport the steel stored in the plant within ten days, regardless of day or night, and send it to Songjiang Station, load it on trains, and transport it to Shanghai, and then transport it to Japan. The traitors are unscrupulous, which is very sad.

### Jiaotong University Held Its 43rd Anniversary Celebration Yesterday - President Li Zhaohuan Represents Lehigh University of the United States - Conferred Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree on Yan Deqing

Yesterday (the 8th) was the 43rd anniversary of the establishment of Jiaotong University. Therefore, at 5 p.m., the anniversary ceremony was held in the auditorium of the YMCA in Baixianqiao, and an honorary doctorate of laws degree was awarded to Yan Deqing on behalf of Lehigh University of the United States. More than 200 Chinese and foreign guests, including Hu Dunfu, He Dekui, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and faculty and students of the school, attended. Because the time was extraordinary, the ceremony was very simple, and the atmosphere was solemn. At the beginning of the meeting, President Li Zhaohuan reported that the school was established in the 23rd year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty. At first, it was only a normal school. Through years of expansion, it now has five colleges, ten departments, and six courses. In terms of quality and quantity, although it cannot be compared with advanced schools in Europe and the United States, it has the scale of a modern university. Over the years, thousands of students have graduated, and they have all been able to work hard in the engineering and transportation sectors. In this process of building a new China, graduates of the school have made many contributions. At this time of serious national crisis, the faculty and students of the Shanghai, Ping, and Tang colleges of the school have experienced many hardships due to the relocation of the school site, but they have worked hard and become more interested in birds. Today is the 43rd anniversary of the establishment of the school. It is appropriate that Lehigh University of the United States awarded Yan Deqing an honorary doctorate of laws degree. It specifically commissioned the school to represent it, so it held a ceremony today to award the diploma to Dr. Yan, and used it to commemorate the painstaking efforts and difficult management of the school's office staff for the past 43 years, and to make the faculty and students feel more deeply the importance of the responsibilities they bear and to encourage themselves. Furthermore, the school is fortunate to have the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life in China and abroad during this extraordinary period, so that it can continue to study without interruption. Thank you very much for this. I hope to give more guidance in the future.

Then Zhang Zongyuan, an alumnus of the school, gave a congratulatory speech. After the speech, the ceremony of awarding the honorary doctorate degree to Yan was held. First, Zhang Tingjin, Dean of the College of Engineering of the school, introduced Yan on behalf of Su Cailun, Chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering of Lehigh University. Then Principal Li awarded the certificate on behalf of the President of Lehigh University, Yan delivered a reply, and finally Chu, the Dean of the Sino-French Institute of Technology, and Grosso, the Director of the Education Department of the French Concession, spoke and dispersed.

In addition, the President of Lehigh University said in his speech, "Yan Deqing has made contributions to the motherland, and added glory to the alma mater. He has served in the railway industry for many years, and has made outstanding achievements in both engineering and management." Su Cailun, Chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering of Lehigh University, said in his speech, "Mr. Yan graduated from Lehigh University in 1901 with excellent grades. After returning to China, he served as a railway engineer and director of the administration. He has made great achievements in the country and his reputation is well-known. Mr. Yan was the first Chinese student to graduate from Lehigh University. He obtained a degree in civil engineering in 1901 and then worked in the American Bridge Company for one year. After returning to China, Mr. Yan devoted himself to the railway business for ten years, and was promoted from railway assistant engineer to chief engineer, and was sent to Sichuan to serve. In 1912, Mr. Yan was appointed Director of the Railway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, and then served in various important positions in the Ministry of Railways. He once represented the Ministry of Railways to Europe and the United States to discuss military issues. The Chinese government, in view of Mr. Yan's outstanding achievements, has repeatedly awarded him to comfort his hard work. Lehigh University is also proud to have cultivated such outstanding talents. All faculty and staff members have passed a resolution to remotely award Mr. Yan an honorary doctorate of laws degree because of his dedication to the country and his alma mater. This kind of honorary degree award is only the second time in the history of the university. Yan Deqing, a graduate of Lehigh University in 1901, has made special contributions to the engineering community and added glory to the alma mater. I especially represent all the faculty and staff members to present you with the honorary doctorate of laws degree." From this, it can be seen that Dr. Yan's knowledge and career are often admired by us.

### Jingjiang Middle School - 41st Anniversary Celebration

The Jingjiang Middle School Anniversary Celebration was originally scheduled to be held on April 1, but it was changed to the 7th at the school on Xinzha Road due to rainy weather. More than 300 school directors, students' parents, and guests attended. The meeting was held at 2 p.m., and the ceremony was performed. Principal Zhang Haicheng gave an opening speech, saying that the school has been established for two weeks, and it had previously acquired more than 290 acres of land in Zhenjiang and raised a large amount of money. It was in the process of building an ideal school when it was suspended due to the current situation. In order to cultivate talents for the country, to protect the integrity of teachers, and to provide relief to young people who have lost their studies, fortunately, the school directors in the financial circles of Zhenjiang and Shanghai have enthusiastically assisted and have remained unwavering, so they can resume classes in Shanghai. Because the rent in Shanghai is extremely high, the school's administrative income is not enough to cover the expenses. The school has been resuming classes for nearly a year, and the subsidies have been several thousand yuan. Fortunately, we are running education for education, which we do not count, and the enthusiasm and assistance of the school directors is really commendable. He also explained the significance of holding the school anniversary in the national crisis, the process of setting up the school in Zhenjiang, and the future plan after moving to Shanghai. School directors Yan Huanyu, Chen Miancai, Bao Mingshu, and others successively gave speeches, all praising Principal Zhang's enthusiasm for running the school. It is hoped that this sincere and tireless spirit will continue to advance without limit. Student representative Gong Da'e gave a congratulatory speech. Teachers and students presented souvenirs (students had a clock, a school sign, and a "Reflect on Yourself" standing mirror, and the teachers had a "Remember the Source of Water" teapot). The chairman gave a thank you speech, and the students sang the school song. The concert began, and the Chinese music programs included Chinese music ensemble, Kunqu Opera, Pipa solo, Qin Xiao ensemble, etc. for eight performances. Western music programs included trumpet solo, piano performance, male and female soprano solo, violin solo, and piano, flute, clarinet, cello, and four-army ensemble, etc., also for eight performances. Everyone contributed their talents, and applause rose from time to time. The guests enjoyed themselves to the fullest, and dispersed until dusk.

### Full Text of Resolutions of the Third National Education Conference (3) - Higher Education Improvement Plan (Part 1)

— (A special reporter from Shen Bao, Yisheng, mailed from Chongqing by air)

The Higher Education Improvement Plan passed by the National Education Conference is as follows:

Since the establishment of higher education in our country, it has developed the fastest, and since the outbreak of the war, it has suffered the most damage. However, higher education bears a heavy responsibility for the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. All facilities should be improved in response to the needs of the times. The matters that should be improved are proposed as follows:

(1) Rationalization of the Establishment of Schools and Departments 1. The Ministry of Education should consider the population, economy, culture, and other conditions in various places, and divide the country into several university education zones. Each zone should have at least one university, and each university must also be responsible for studying social culture and production and construction issues in the region.

2. Each normal college district should have one normal college, and each normal college must also be responsible for researching and guiding secondary education in the region.

3. General and vocational schools of agriculture, industry, commerce, and medicine should be set up comprehensively at appropriate locations. Each school should be closely linked with agricultural, industrial, commercial, and medical colleges of universities in neighboring areas, and with production enterprises and agencies, and should also guide higher and elementary vocational schools in the region.

4. Agricultural, industrial, and medical colleges should be added. In principle, each province should set up one as needed. The number of places in existing agricultural, industrial, and medical colleges should be expanded, and agricultural, industrial, medical, and pharmaceutical specialties should be added as appropriate to create a grand future.

5. Repeated and unnecessary colleges and departments in the same region should continue to be adjusted.

6. There are many colleges and universities above the junior college level in the southwestern provinces that have moved in from the war zones. The number has suddenly increased. After the end of the War of Resistance, there should be a comprehensive rectification plan for these schools. During the War of Resistance, except for those that are overly duplicated, they should be merged as appropriate, and the rest will be temporarily allowed to be set up as usual. However, schools in the same region should have practical cooperation in terms of curriculum setting, equipment use, and teacher distribution in order to increase efficiency.

7. The establishment of private colleges and universities should be restricted or rewarded depending on the circumstances.

### Closing of the McTyeire School Basketball Tournament, McTyeire Champions, 60 to 44 Victory Over Chung Teh

The final act of the McTyeire School basketball tournament, McTyeire versus Chung Teh, took place yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the American School.

Since arriving in Shanghai, the Canadian School of Kobe has competed against the American School Giants three times, winning all three games. Last night at 8:30 PM, they played an exhibition match against the Jinan team, the champion of the Shanghai school basketball league, at the gymnasium of the American School on Avenue Petain.

### Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Left Shanghai for Chongqing Yesterday, Sir Robert Clive to Return to Japan, Clive Held Two Meetings With Japanese Officials, Conversations With Both Ambassadors Were Said to Be Important

Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, took advantage of his vacation to come to Shanghai and meet with Sir Robert Clive, the British Ambassador to China, to discuss and review the general situation in the Far East and Britain's future policy towards the Far East for several days. It was learned yesterday that the meeting had come to an end. Ambassador Clive left Shanghai for Hong Kong yesterday to transfer to Chongqing to discuss Sino-British diplomatic affairs with the Chinese government authorities. Ambassador Clark Kerr also took the Japanese ship Terukuni Maru from Shanghai back to Japan. This meeting of the two ambassadors, which attracted the attention of various parties in Europe and Asia, ended yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:

Japanese Officials Held Two Receptions

After Ambassador Clark Kerr arrived in Shanghai, he invited Chinese gentry Yu Qiaqing, Xi Yushu, and others to dine with him, and Ambassador Clive invited Japanese Embassy Counselor Morishima and Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Miura to meet with Clark Kerr at a banquet. Later, on the 7th at noon, Japanese officials from the foreign, naval, and army sides in Shanghai jointly hosted Ambassador Clark Kerr and Ambassador Clive. The Japanese participants included Counselor Morishima, Lieutenant General Nomura, Lieutenant General Kita, Sato, Major General Sakurai, Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya, and other officials. It is understood that these two meetings between Japanese officials and Ambassador Clark Kerr were of a reception nature and did not mention any specific issues.

Clark Kerr Returns to Japan After the Talks

After completing his mission of meeting with Ambassador Clive, Ambassador Clark Kerr, accompanied by his wife and Air Force Colonel Blunt, took the Terukuni Maru from the Bund wharf at 6:00 AM yesterday (8th) and set sail for Japan and then Tokyo to take up his post. Ambassador Clive and the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Phillips, and others went to the wharf to see him off. Before leaving, Ambassador Clark Kerr sent a letter to the Tokyo Embassy, informing them of his itinerary. It is not yet determined whether Clark Kerr will stay in Yokohama.

Issued a Statement Saying There Was No Mission

Before leaving for Japan yesterday morning, British Ambassador to Japan Clark Kerr issued a statement to foreign reporters, stating that he had taken this vacation to come to Shanghai to visit the British Ambassador to China in order to exchange views on issues of mutual concern. He had long wanted to come to Shanghai during his term of office. His predecessor always took the route through Shanghai to Japan, but only he himself took the route through Canada to Japan, so he had no opportunity to come to Shanghai. His trip had no political significance and no mission. It was also unrelated to Ambassador Clive's trip to Chongqing.

Clive to Visit Various Authorities in Chongqing

After seeing off Ambassador Clark Kerr, Sir Robert Clive, the British Ambassador to China, took the Taiyuan ship to Hong Kong at 12:30 PM yesterday (8th) due to ongoing negotiations on Sino-British diplomatic affairs. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned yesterday that Clive's itinerary is scheduled to transfer to Haiphong after arriving in Hong Kong, take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming, and then take a plane from Kunming to Chongqing to visit the Chinese government authorities. The duration of his stay in Chongqing has not been scheduled, but it is expected to be about a week before returning to Shanghai.

The Conclusions of the Meeting Were Not Superficial

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency also learned from people familiar with international affairs that Clark Kerr's visit to China and his meeting with Ambassador Clive had expressed deep concern about Britain's past and future trade situation in the Far East when they met with British businessmen in Shanghai. It is widely believed that his meeting with Ambassador Clive was related to Britain's future policy towards the Far East. Although the stay was only three or four days, the conclusions reached were of considerable value. Therefore, Clark Kerr's trip is related to Britain's future Far East policy and is by no means superficial. The British government is now waiting for the real report after the meeting between the two ambassadors.

### Japanese Tighten Searches in Hongkou, Threatened by Two Fires

The Japanese Telegraph Office between Xihua Road and Tiantong Road in Hongkou was nearly destroyed by fire at 5:10 AM on the 6th. The Japanese Telegraph Office's back road is Fude Road, which has three empty houses very close to the Telegraph Office. Tens of thousands of bales of cotton, looted by the Japanese in the guerrilla zone, were stored in the houses. At 5:10 AM on the morning of the 6th, a fire suddenly broke out. The fire was very fierce and the smoke was thick. It was about to spread to the Japanese Telegraph Office when the Japanese sounded the alarm and sent vehicles to put out the fire. As a result, all three buildings were burned to the ground, but the Japanese Telegraph Office was fortunately unharmed. According to the Japanese, this action was a planned act of sabotage by Chinese terrorists, attempting to burn down the Telegraph Office, similar to the burning of the godowns on Huangpu Road some time ago. They also admitted that a large number of "terrorists" were hiding in Hongkou. Therefore, in recent days, the search and interrogation of residents and Chinese entering and leaving the area have been stricter than in the past.

### French Ambassador to Arrive in Shanghai at 9 AM This Morning, Mr. Cosme Visited China Once Ten Years Ago, Expressing Sympathy for China's Hardships

The newly appointed French Ambassador to China, Cosme, after arriving in Hong Kong, went directly to Chongqing on March 5 to present his credentials to the National Government. He stayed for five days and met with Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and Foreign Minister Wang. After completing his official duties, he flew from Chongqing to Kunming on the 22nd of last month. After entertaining Chairman Long and others, he transferred to Hanoi to meet with the Governor of Annam, before transferring to Hong Kong. He then took the gunboat "D'Entrecasteaux" to Shanghai. According to reliable sources in the transportation industry, Cosme is scheduled to arrive in the city at 9:00 AM this (9th) morning. The ship will dock at the Taikoo Wharf. The French Consul-General and French business leaders in the city will all be there to welcome him. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, Cosme came to China from Europe in 1927 and served in the country's embassy in Peiping. He has always been committed to promoting Sino-French relations. This is his second time in China, and he will further promote relations between the two countries. He has expressed his deep sympathy and eagerness in various places such as Hong Kong and Chongqing.

### Japanese Notification to German, Italian, and Other Consulates, Spreading Rumors of an Attack on Eastern Zhejiang, Requesting Notification to Their Respective Nationals to Report Property, Otherwise the Japanese Side Will Not Be Responsible for Any Damage

—General Speculation Is That This Move Is Intended to Intimidate—

The German, Italian, and other consulates in this city recently received a notice from Miura, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, spreading rumors that the Japanese army would take action in Eastern Zhejiang, requesting that the commercial property of their respective nationals in Eastern Zhejiang be reported in a list. The consulates then notified their respective nationals to report. As a result, the atmosphere in Eastern Zhejiang became slightly tense again. The resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo is unlikely to be realized in the short term. The details are reported separately by a reporter from the Modern News Agency as follows:

Japanese Consul Spreads Rumors of Action

Since the Japanese side has repeatedly carried out harassment along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang, the military authorities of Zhejiang Province, in order to strengthen defense and protect the local area, have mobilized a large army, stationed in various important strongholds, ready to strike at those who strike. At the same time, the Zhenhai Estuary in Ningbo was also approved by the Military Affairs Committee to be closed from the 5th to consolidate the coastal defense. Therefore, the situation in Eastern Zhejiang has eased in recent days, and the situation in various places is extremely peaceful. However, the German, Italian, and other consulates in this city suddenly received a notice from Miura, the Japanese Consul-General, some days ago, spreading rumors that the Japanese army would take action in Eastern Zhejiang, hoping to inform their respective nationals to quickly report in a list the ships sailing in Eastern Zhejiang and all commercial property in Eastern Zhejiang in order to avoid losses. Otherwise, the Japanese side will not be responsible, etc. The German and Italian consulates informed their respective nationals yesterday to report so that they can be forwarded to the Japanese side.

General Speculation Is That This Move Is Intended to Intimidate

Since the above news came out, it has been generally speculated that the Japanese side may take military action in various places in Eastern Zhejiang in the short term, so the atmosphere seems tense again. However, according to news from relevant sources, the Japanese side's move is obviously intended to intimidate. At present, the Chinese armies in various places have unanimously launched a general counter-offensive, and the advance is very smooth. The Japanese army is quite panic, so they are spreading rumors of action in Eastern Zhejiang to show intimidation and attempt to disturb the people in the rear. However, it is widely believed that this move will not be effective, because the Chinese armies in Eastern Zhejiang are all ready to fight, and the people in various places are also united against the enemy. Therefore, there is no reason to cause panic about the Japanese side's move.

The Opening of Zhenhai Is Unlikely to Be Realized for the Time Being

Since the Zhenhai Estuary in Ningbo was ordered to be closed at 3:00 PM on the 5th, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route has been completely interrupted. All relevant parties believe that the traffic obstruction will have a major impact. Originally, they intended to request the authorities to dispatch ships to restrict navigation in order to maintain traffic. However, according to a reporter from the Modern News Agency who inquired from the shipping industry yesterday, a large number of foreign ships are currently being detained by Japanese warships in the waters of Eastern Zhejiang, and shipping is being harassed. The Japanese consul notified the German, Italian, and other consulates, spreading rumors of action, so they do not intend to request reopening. It is expected that traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo is unlikely to resume sailing in the short term.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Guangxi Currency to Circulate in Various Provinces, Approves Each Yuan Worth 5 Jiao in Legal Tender, Four Banks Only Exchange as Much as the Rate Allows

The banknotes issued by the Guangxi Silver Bank were previously approved by the Ministry of Finance to be worth 5 jiao of legal tender. All reserve funds for the issuance of Guangxi currency were also uniformly handed over to the Guangxi Branch of the Issuance Reserve Fund Management Committee for management. Therefore, Guangxi currency and legal tender are now one and the same, without any difference. In order to expand the circulation area of Guangxi currency so that people can carry and use it, the provincial government specially telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to issue a notice to all provinces, stating that Guangxi currency can be circulated in various places at the same exchange rate as legal tender in the future, and ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to exchange Guangxi currency as much as possible at the same exchange rate without restrictions. Now, the Ministry of Finance has approved the electricity to Chongqing, "I understand your instructions regarding the notification that Guangxi currency can be circulated in various places at the same exchange rate as legal tender and that the four banks in various places should exchange Guangxi currency as much as possible at the same exchange rate. Your consideration is thorough and deeply admired. The banknotes issued by the provincial bank in the past and the issuance reserve funds have been received by the Issuance Reserve Fund Management Committee. The issuance of subsidiary currency notes has been deposited in accordance with the regulations. During this extraordinary period, when they flow out of the province, they should be accepted and used by the four banks in various places as a whole. The Ministry has sent a letter to the joint office of the four banks to forward it to the four banks for implementation. Previously, before the Guangxi currency was received and sorted out by the Preparation Committee last year, the Guangxi provincial troops carried it out of the province for use. The Ministry has notified the branches of the four banks in various places by telephone to allow them to exchange it as much as possible at a ratio of two to one in order to maintain circulation. Now that the Guangxi currency is outside, it can be used at the same rate, and there will be no discrimination. I hope you will pay attention."

### Shanghai Stock Exchange Ordered to Prepare for Resumption of Business, Securities, Cloth, Flour, and Grain Exchanges, Will Resume Trading as Soon as Reorganization is Completed

Regarding the resumption of business of the Shanghai exchanges, the various exchanges had previously submitted methods and suggestions to the central government by telegram. After research by the Ministries of Finance and Economy, it has been approved. According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency who inquired from relevant sources, except for the Gold Exchange, which will be postponed, the other four exchanges, such as Securities, Cloth, Flour, and Grain, will prepare to resume trading in the shortest possible time after reorganization. The details are recorded as follows:

Suggestions Approved by the Central Government

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the withdrawal of the National Army, the various exchanges in this city had to suspend business one after another due to the harsh environment, waiting for the central government to deal with them. During this period, the puppet "Reform Government" wooed traitors in an attempt to take over and manage them. Fortunately, the various exchanges responded calmly and were not realized. The Ministries of Finance and Economy were quite concerned about the current situation of the various exchanges. In September of last year, they issued a clear order to the various exchanges to find ways to resume business and stipulated three methods: (1) For securities, the price of government bond trading should not be lower than 70%; (2) For cloth, the standard market price and grade of Chinese cloth tickets were specified; (3) For those engaged in general exchange operations, non-industry trading or non-economists shall not participate in transactions. After careful discussion of the above clear order, the various exchanges believed that it was not good, so they jointly discussed a more specific and suitable method for the current situation and submitted it to the central government. After several months, the Ministries of Finance and Economy, in addition to approving the various exchanges to wait for instructions, also submitted it to the Economic and Legal Systems Committee for review. According to a reporter, the central government issued another order at the end of last month, instructing the various exchanges to follow the methods suggested by the various exchanges.

Four Exchanges Prepare to Resume

The Securities, Cloth, Flour, and Grain Exchanges in this city have begun to hold board meetings after receiving the clear order from the Ministries of Finance and Economy. The brokers will also hold a meeting in the coming days to discuss it. As soon as the various exchanges are reorganized, they will prepare to resume business in the shortest possible time. As for the Flour Exchange, which was newly opened on Mingong Road and Xinkai River in the Southern City, its address is in the Chinese area, so it will find a suitable house in the concession or temporarily borrow from another exchange as a market for expedient use.

Gold Exchange Postpones Resumption

Regarding the resumption of business of the Gold Exchange, due to the current tense international situation, the overseas market's gold prices fluctuate high and low, and are unstable. If the Shanghai gold market resumes business, it will inevitably be affected and affected by the international market. Secondly, it is feared that someone will take the opportunity to manipulate and affect finance, so the central government decided to postpone the resumption of business.

### Overseas Chinese in France Donate Money to Sponsor Refugees, Remitting Money Once Every Six Months Until Relief Ends

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Fundraising Committee has launched a refugee relief sponsorship movement, which has been deeply supported by enthusiastic people from all walks of life, and the benefits to the disaster victims are not shallow. The association received a letter from Geng Shou, an overseas Chinese in Saint-Truce, France, and attached 250 French francs to cover the expenses of sponsoring refugees. The original letter said, "I am writing to inform you that I have received your letter of February 23 and a receipt exchange slip, which I have carefully noted. 50 francs can be exchanged for more than 8 yuan in national currency, which can support four refugees. I am very pleased. I am now enclosing three French franc notes, totaling 250 French francs, as donations for February, March, April, May, June, and May. Please check and reply. I will remit money once every six months thereafter until your association ends. If your association has any donation printed matter, please send a few copies so that I can solicit donations from overseas Chinese in Europe and do my best." The Citizens Group Fundraising Committee believes that Mr. Geng is still in France, and he is very concerned about the refugees in the country and has been donating money for a long time. His enthusiasm is admirable. It has checked the sponsorship certificate and receipt and sent a special letter of thanks.

### Jiangsu Security Third Regiment Arrived in Pudong, Guerrilla Team Has Been Reorganized, Japanese Troops from Nanshi Cross the River to Reinforce

According to people who came from Pudong, on the night of the 5th of this month, a large number of Chinese troops suddenly arrived in Pudong from a certain place. The strength of these Chinese troops is very strong, with a machine gun in each squad, and they are in high spirits. The second squadron of Weng's troops and Wang Boxiang, etc., have been reorganized by these Chinese troops. According to the person in charge of these Chinese troops, they will start to eliminate the puppet army. It is said that these Chinese troops are the Infantry Third Regiment of the Third District Security Team of Jiangsu Province, which is well-known. It is also said that the Kikuchi unit of the Japanese army stationed on Penglai Road in Nanshi was suddenly dispatched last night (7th) to reinforce Pudong. Before leaving, all the military telephones at the various sentry posts were also removed. This situation of the Japanese army may be concentrated in Pudong, with some intention.

### Illegal Actions of Japanese Warships: Nine Foreign Vessels Detained and Inspected; Forcibly Steered to the Mouth of the Song River Yesterday Morning and Not Yet Released by Evening; Portuguese Consulate to Lodge a Serious Protest

According to sources in foreign shipping circles, nine foreign vessels, including the "Hailong," were detained and inspected by Japanese warships in the waters off Dinghai, Zhejiang Province. Yesterday morning, they were forcibly steered to anchor outside the mouth of the Wusong River. The crew and passengers are safe. The Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai is preparing to lodge a serious protest. The "Meifa," "Tangsai," and other vessels, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou yesterday, have now decided to temporarily suspend their voyages. The details are as follows:

Nine Foreign Vessels Suddenly Detained and Inspected

Since the outbreak of the war, the navigation routes to eastern Zhejiang have been operated by shipping companies from countries such as Britain, Germany, Italy, and Portugal. For more than a year, there have been no incidents. After the successive blockades of Haimen and Zhenhai, the vessels have all changed their routes to Wenzhou, resulting in more than ten foreign vessels operating there. Recently, three Japanese warships suddenly appeared in the waters off Dinghai. Since the day before yesterday morning, they have been inspecting all vessels on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. Over the past two days, the foreign vessels detained and inspected in the waters off Dinghai include: (1) the "Hailong" of the Portuguese-owned Atlantic Company; (2) the "Meida" of the Portuguese-owned Meili Company; (3) the "Tanglu," represented by the American-owned Huamei Company, all of which sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai on the 6th; (4) the "Tangqiao" and "Tangbei," represented by the American-owned Huamei Company, which sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day before yesterday; (5) the "Libao" of the Portuguese-owned Zhengde Company, which sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 5th; (6) also the diesel-powered flat-bottomed boats "Baode," "Dama," "Mime," etc., which also sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai. In total, nine foreign vessels were detained and searched by Japanese warships in the waters off Dinghai.

Forcibly Steered to Anchor at the Mouth of the Song River Yesterday Morning

After receiving the news of the search, the vessels became extremely concerned as they did not receive any further news of release and the time had been long. The respective companies sent telegrams, but received no response, as the radio equipment on each vessel had been monitored by the Japanese and could not send reports. It was not until 8:30 PM the night before last that the Meili Company received a telegram from the owner of the "Meida," stating, "Received notification from the Japanese Navy to return to Shanghai, expected to arrive at Wusong tomorrow (i.e., yesterday)." It is understood that the vessels were steered to the Tongsha waters outside the mouth of the Wusong River yesterday morning around 9 AM under the surveillance of Japanese warships. However, as of 6 PM yesterday afternoon, there was still no news of their release.

Portuguese Consulate to Lodge a Serious Protest

It is understood that the above vessel companies are all purely foreign-owned and operated, and have registered with the consulate and obtained certificates. The reason for this sudden detention and inspection by Japanese warships is very perplexing. The companies immediately reported the situation to the Portuguese Consulate-General in Shanghai and requested negotiations. After receiving the report, the consulate considered the situation to be serious and immediately made oral representations to the Japanese consulate. However, the Japanese consulate claimed that this was a matter for the navy and that the consulate had not received a report and therefore could not express an opinion. The Portuguese consulate has now decided to prepare a serious protest to ensure the navigation rights and interests of Portuguese merchants in China.

Crew and Passengers Are All Safe

After the news of the vessels being detained reached Shanghai, the families of the passengers and crew were extremely concerned about their safety and inquired with the respective companies. Subsequently, the "Tangqiao" and other vessels telegraphed that the vessels were temporarily anchored outside the mouth of the Song River, and the officers and passengers on board were all safe and had not been subjected to any alarm. It is also understood that the vessels were all equipped with emergency rations (note: these rations are prepared for use in the event of unexpected circumstances at sea), so there is no problem with food for the crew and passengers. It is expected that after the Portuguese consulate's negotiations, the vessels will all be able to return to Shanghai safely.

"Meifa" and Other Vessels Temporarily Suspend Sailings

The "Meifa" of the Meili Company and the "Tangsai" of the Huamei Company were originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Wenzhou yesterday. However, due to the sudden detention and inspection of the "Tangbei," "Meida," and other vessels in the waters off Dinghai, the reason for which is unknown, and repeated telegrams have not received news of their release, it has been decided to temporarily suspend sailings and wait for the vessels to arrive in Shanghai before jointly deciding on a course of action. In addition, the "Shantai" of the Portuguese-owned Zhengde Company, because it was not registered in Wenzhou, took the opportunity to enter a dock for repairs after the Ningbo River was blockaded. The "Hana" of the German-owned Far East Company has also temporarily suspended sailings due to hull repairs.

"Feikang" and Other Vessels Arrive Safely in Wenzhou

The "Feikang" of the German-owned Lulin Yangxing sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the morning of the 6th. At 4 PM that afternoon, when it sailed to the waters off Dinghai, it was suddenly fired upon three times by a Japanese warship. Fortunately, it was not hit. The vessel continued to sail and telegraphed the Shanghai company to report the incident. The company subsequently received a telegram from the shipowner, Mr. Kebei, stating that the vessel had arrived safely in Wenzhou. Also, the "Baoli" of the Italian-owned Huayi Yangxing, which sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 5th, has also been telegraphed as having arrived safely in Wenzhou. Furthermore, the "Deping" of the Italian-owned company and the "Moufu" of the German-owned company, which sailed to Wenzhou the day before yesterday, both arrived in Wenzhou one after another last night and will return to Shanghai within days after unloading their cargo.

Report of "Pelleto" Detained Is Inaccurate

Furthermore, yesterday morning, it was widely rumored in this city that a large Italian vessel with the CIN mark was also detained among the foreign vessels detained in the waters off eastern Zhejiang. After inquiries by the reporter of the Modern News Agency, it was learned that in addition to the "Baoli" which had already arrived in Wenzhou, there was also the "Pelleto" which sailed to Fuzhou the day before yesterday. Subsequently, according to news from the company, the vessel has already arrived in Fuzhou, so the rumor of its detention is actually inaccurate.

Foreign Merchants Collectively Discuss Effective Response

Shipowners from Portugal, Germany, and other countries in this city believe that the search and detention of a large number of vessels in the waters off eastern Zhejiang and the shooting at German vessels indicates that the Japanese side is deliberately obstructing the shipping of various countries and squeezing out legitimate shipping businesses. In addition to separately reporting to their respective consulates-general in Shanghai and lodging strong protests, they also plan to collectively discuss effective response measures and request their respective governments to provide them with firm guarantees.

### The Japanese Puppet Regime Attempts to Revise the North China Customs Tariff Again; Intends to Reduce Import Duties on Japanese and "Manchukuo" Goods; Also Plans to Abolish the Customs Gold Unit

According to the English-language "China Press," the Japanese government and the "Provisional Government" of Peiping are currently holding economic conferences in Tokyo to consider revising the North China customs tariff. The economic delegation of the Peiping regime is led by the "Ministers of Finance and Economy" and went to Japan a few days ago to discuss ways to further strengthen economic ties between Japan, "Manchukuo," and North China. The main method in the plan seems to be to change the North China customs system, especially to reduce import duties on a large number of goods, such as raw materials, agricultural products, machinery, chemicals, medicines, and objects "necessary for the development of North China." It is a matter of course that most of these reduced import duties are for goods that Japan and "Manchukuo" import to North China in large quantities. According to a statement in Peiping, the "Reformed Government" established a special committee some time ago to prepare for another adjustment of North China customs. The committee will submit its report with various recommendations, one of which will advocate the abolition of the customs gold unit and the adoption of a new permanent customs exchange rate. This exchange rate will be roughly based on parity with the Japanese yen. Regarding this point, the Peiping puppet also admits that there is a need to consult with Western countries, but it does not intend to delay changing the North China system until such consultations have begun or produced results. In the near future, regardless of possible opposition from European and American countries, it will be ordered to be implemented "under the guise of" temporary transitional "methods."

### Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings of Past Dynasties; Preview to be Held Tomorrow; Displaying More Than Three Hundred Masterpieces

The exhibition of calligraphy and paintings of past Chinese dynasties, initiated and prepared by Pu Xiyuan, Liu Haisu, Wu Hufan, and more than thirty others for over a month, has collected more than 360 treasured works from major collectors, all representative masterpieces from various masters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. It has been decided that a preview will be held tomorrow to invite Chinese and foreign guests and newspaper reporters, and Dr. Yen Hui-ching will hold the opening ceremony. Mr. Pang Laichen has provided ten pieces, including Wu Zhen's "Reed Flowers and Wild Geese" from the Yuan Dynasty, Guo Tianxi's "Fairyland in a Pot," Liu Jue's "Summer Clouds Threatening Rain" from the Ming Dynasty, and Sheng Maoye's "Brocade Cave and Green Mountain."

All are Masterpieces; Mr. Pu Xiyuan has provided three pieces, including Ni Yuanlu's "Landscape, Wood, and Stone Scroll" from the Ming Dynasty, which is considered Ni Hongbao's most satisfying work of his life, Huang Daozhou's landscape, and Yang Wencong's "Secluded Dwelling in a Mountain Villa."

### Patriotic Leaflets Discovered in Hongkou; Japanese Army Panics and Intensifies Searches; Patrol Teams Patrol Various Roads

The Japanese army in the Hongkou district, due to the frequent discovery of patriotic leaflets and slogans supporting the central government and resisting Japan in various places recently, has since the day before yesterday dispatched patrol teams, each consisting of five people, to patrol various roads. The barriers on various bridges remain the same, such as those on North Sichuan Road, Yokohama Bridge, Hanbury Road, Lihong Bridge, Yalu Road, Sikaizi Bridge, and Ou Jia Road New Bridge, all of which are guarded by many Japanese and puppet troops who search vehicles and pedestrians. Their level of fear can be seen in general.

### Silk Factories Go to Various Places to Purchase Spring Cocoons; Request Zhejiang Authorities to Provide Convenience

Since the beginning of this year, the silk factories in western Shanghai, although still operating day and night, have been experiencing a severe shortage of cocoon supplies. Apart from some factories making every effort to purchase supplies in various parts of eastern and western Zhejiang to maintain operations, those unable to purchase supplies have been forced to reduce their operations. Now that the silkworm season has arrived and the spring cocoons are about to enter the market, the silk cocoon business in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been indirectly controlled since the "Central China Company" monopolized it, and all silkworm breeding businesses have also been indirectly subjected to control. In the future, when spring cocoons enter the market, they will inevitably be forcibly purchased. In order to plan ahead, personnel have been dispatched to the interior to place orders. At the same time, they intend to discuss with the Zhejiang provincial authorities and provide as much convenience as possible to the silk factories in Shanghai that go to eastern Zhejiang to purchase cocoons during the spring cocoon harvest season in various counties of eastern Zhejiang.

### Japanese Warships Inspect the British Vessel "Suiyang"; Also Obstruct the Unloading of the Jiangsu Vessel

On the 24th, a Japanese armed fishing boat, under the cover of a Japanese aircraft, entered Beihai port and circled the Swire "Jiangsu" vessel, which was berthed there, threatening it, causing the vessel to be unable to load and unload cargo. After anchoring in the Beihai sea area for two days, it sailed to Hefang.

### Chinese Guerrillas Damage the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Tracks; Traffic Interrupted on Both Lines Yesterday; Japanese Side Panic and Hide Vehicles

"Special Report from this Newspaper" Since the recent sudden improvement in the Chinese military situation, the response work of guerrillas in various places has also been extremely active. The other day, the tracks near the Lingkou Station between Danyang and Lucheng on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway were destroyed for more than twenty feet by guerrillas, causing a passenger train from Nanjing to Shanghai to be stranded at Zhenjiang Station for as long as four hours. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line was also in a state of emergency. Therefore, traffic on both the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines was suddenly interrupted yesterday. According to extremely reliable sources, the Japanese army has been in a state of extreme panic for days. The other day, the Japanese army moved all 120 passenger and freight cars from the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to Wusong for concealment, covering them with branches and leaves as camouflage. Yesterday, another 40 cars were moved. This shows the Japanese army's panic and fear.

### Grain Exchange Suffers Another Relocation Dispute; Staff and Laborers Petition to Continue Residence; Mediation Fails, and Lawsuit is Filed Again

Sun Bingzhong, Wang Yongchang, Xu Xiangyan, Zhu Daoxin, Yu Guorui, Li Jianliu, Cai Danhan, Gu Shenqi, and sixty other members of the staff and laborers of the Shanghai Grain and Oilcake Exchange located on Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, have retained a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against the directors and executive committee members of the Exchange, Chen Ziyi, Cai Yukun, Jiang Hongbin, Cao Xingeng, Yang Heqing, She Bingwen, Chen Yuming, Jiang Lansheng, Yin Yucun, and others, requesting mediation, payment of living expenses, and permission for the staff and laborers

to continue to reside. It is claimed that the petitioners have been serving at the Shanghai Grain and Oilcake Exchange. Last year, due to the issue of living expenses, litigation was initiated, and through the mediation of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, an amicable agreement was reached between the two parties in January of this year, with the opposing party paying on a monthly basis. Unexpectedly, payments were suddenly stopped this month, causing the petitioners to face the threat of insufficient food and clothing. They requested mediation to order the opposing party to continue payments as before. Furthermore, a small portion of the staff and laborers and their families are currently residing in the exchange. According to the agreement, they should have moved out by February 18. However, the opposing party's board of directors passed a resolution on January 10 regarding the relocation of exchange staff and the rental of vacant rooms on the third and fourth floors to increase revenue. However,

the staff and laborers residing there are precisely because they have not yet obtained suitable housing, and most of their native homes have been destroyed, leaving them homeless. Therefore, to cater to the opposing party's desire for revenue, they voluntarily offered to contribute to the rent within their means, but the opposing party deliberately made things difficult and could not reach an agreement, causing the residents to feel anxious and insecure. They requested mediation to continue their residence. The court accepted the petition and opened the fourth courtroom for mediation yesterday morning. Only the petitioners and their legal representative were present. The opposing party was absent. After a brief questioning by the judge, it was announced that the mediation had failed and that a formal lawsuit should be filed.

### Romantic Young Woman Commits Suicide by Swallowing Gold

Yang Wenying, a young woman from Anhui province, eighteen years old, whose mother worked as a maid at the Wang residence at 50 Foch Road, Model Village. The young woman came to Shanghai from her hometown at the age of eleven and also lived in the residence as a maid. As the young woman grew older, her appearance became attractive, and a group of young men would frequently try to seduce her. Subsequently, the young woman's behavior gradually became romantic, and she made many friends. As a result, she often went out on various pretexts and did not return until the next day. Because of her affection for her daughter, her mother did not restrain her, and lately, she had become even more unbridled than before. The night before last, she went out again on some pretext and did not return until the next morning. Because of gossip from others, her mother could not bear it any longer and reprimanded her daughter. Unexpectedly, Wenying, out of shyness, used the excuse of going out to burn incense, took a car alone to the Dahuhu Hotel on Dongxin Bridge, opened room 505, and committed suicide by swallowing a gold ring. Later, she used the telephone to contact her close friend and relay the message to her mother. Upon hearing the news, her mother rushed to the Dahuhu to visit. Seeing her daughter looking dejected, she knew that she had swallowed gold and quickly hired a car to rush her to the hospital for treatment.

### Drug Policy in Western Shanghai Intensifies

News from the News Agency, the prevalence of opium addiction in western Shanghai has been increasing recently. The depth of its harm is greater than floods or fierce beasts. According to reporters' inquiries, its recent practical situation can be roughly divided into two points: (1) The source of opium is now completely controlled by a certain party, which transports it from the Rehe and North China areas and concentrates it in the Hongkou and Zhabei districts to supply opium dealers. (2) The major opium dealers are still Zheng Shishi (Zheng Qiaji Opium Firm), Lin Rongchang, Lan Bason, Zhang Baohua, and others. However, it is now stipulated that those who need to obtain opium from a certain party must be contacted through Zheng's Zheng Qiaji Opium Firm. The required opium is transported by a certain party to the Special Goods Association organized by the Japanese puppet regime, and then distributed by Zheng Qiaji and the other twelve opium firms according to their share. Therefore, Zheng constantly travels to and from the Hongkou area. As a result, the above-mentioned five opium firms also enjoy the most favorable benefits. Under the thirteen opium firms, each has more than ten small opium firms to distribute the goods. Therefore, drug addiction will become increasingly prevalent.

### Gambling Den Cracked Down on Maiteheshi Road; Gamblers Resist Arrest and Two People are Shot

According to the French-language "Shanghai Daily" on the 8th, it was heard that a fairly large gambling den had been opened somewhere on Maiteheshi Road.

It was heard that the gamblers resisted arrest, so two people were shot at the time and have been sent to the hospital for treatment. The gambling den has now been sealed off.

### The Widow's Temperament is Violent and Contrary; The Mother-in-Law and Aunt Stop Support

Yang Xiujuan, a Shaoxing woman who used to work as a female teacher at 6 Wen'anfang, Remi Road, in the French Concession, twenty-six years old this year, recently retained lawyer Tang Hao to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court to stop supporting her widowed sister-in-law, Yang Xu Xiuzhen (thirty-one years old, with two sons, the elder being nine years old and the younger being four years old). It is claimed that the opposing party is the petitioner's widowed sister-in-law. Since her husband's death, the petitioner has temporarily provided food and lodging, and they have lived together. Unexpectedly, the opposing party has a violent and contrary nature, often mistreating her mother-in-law and aunt. Recently, she has been restless, so in accordance with Articles 124 and 125 of the Civil Code, the petitioner should no longer have an obligation to support her. She requested mediation to stop the support. The court approved the request and opened a court session for mediation yesterday morning. The opposing party did not arrive. The petitioner and her lawyer attended the court. After a brief questioning by the judge, it was announced that the mediation had failed and that a formal lawsuit should be filed.

### Woman Punished for Drug Trafficking

A woman surnamed Lu from Pudong, who made a living by selling opium, was busy every day but never exposed. The day before yesterday morning, the woman was again doing her daily work, going to the opium base camp at Xinkang Lane, Kangnao Road, in western Shanghai to buy five taels of opium, divided into twenty packets, wrapped in cloth, and tied to her breasts. She took the No. 10 bus at that place. Suddenly, Chinese and foreign detectives, along with female inspectors, boarded the bus to search male and female passengers. The opium she was carrying was seized, and she was taken into custody by the police. The next morning, she was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhong questioned her and sentenced her to six months in prison. If she chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, the fine would be calculated at three yuan per day of the prison term. The opium was confiscated.

### Japanese Soldiers Search Hongqiao Town; Arrest More Than Twenty Youths; Residents of Western Shanghai are Anxious and Uneasy

Around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, a large contingent of more than one hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers suddenly arrived at Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, carrying small cannons and machine guns, fully armed, and conducted a large-scale search of the residents of the town and demanded to see the residents' certificates. For a time, the situation was serious, and the residents fled in droves. More than twenty people, including Mao Guixiang, who lived in Henan in the town and opened a grocery store, were accused of being guerrillas for not carrying residents' certificates, and were tied tightly with ropes and sent to the Japanese military headquarters at the Toyoda Spinning Factory in Fanwangdu. It is heard that the lives of those arrested are in danger. Furthermore, around 3 AM the morning before yesterday (the 7th), twenty-six Japanese soldiers in disguise went to the villages of Liujianong, Caojiatang, and Shenjiayan in the western part of Caohaijing Town in western Shanghai and searched every household. All the villagers were awakened from their dreams and mistakenly thought that bandits had arrived, so they sounded the alarm by beating gongs. The guerrillas in that area heard the sound and immediately opened fire as a warning. The Japanese soldiers dared not linger and immediately returned. Unexpectedly, around 2 AM the morning before yesterday, a large contingent of more than

two hundred Japanese and puppet troops, one from Lincoln Road to Hongqiao Town and one from Caohaijing Town to the west along Qinghu Road, led by traitors, surrounded the villages in the Zhangshilang, Wangjiaqiao, and Ligenglang areas in two routes, broke down the doors, entered and searched, overturning boxes and rummaging through chests, behaving like robbers, and forced the villagers to provide information on the whereabouts of the guerrillas. If they were not successful, they would immediately inflict torture. As a result, they gained nothing and returned only around 9 AM yesterday morning. Therefore, in the past two days, the residents of the western Shanghai area have been

anxious and uneasy. (Furthermore, according to news) Recently, the Chinese guerrillas have been very active in the western Shanghai area, with a ghostly presence. The Japanese army has become extremely panicked, dare not travel alone during the day, and the Japanese soldiers stationed along the railway and in various towns dare not step out of their defense areas at night. According to a vegetable seller from Hongqiao in western Shanghai who came to Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese military police headquarters in western Shanghai has been sparing no effort in searching for Chinese guerrillas, selecting

Japanese ronin who understand a little Chinese and disguising them as Chinese farmers and workers, forming teams to search for the whereabouts of the guerrillas. Recently, in the villages within one or two li around Hongqiao Town, there are often groups of three to five Japanese soldiers wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, with aprons tied around their waists, looking like Chinese workers, going to various farmers' homes to inquire and demand to see the residents' certificates. If they encounter young farmers, the interrogation becomes

increasingly strict. If there is a slight discrepancy between the language and the photo attached to the resident's certificate, they will be detained. Therefore, most of the able-bodied men in that area have fled to the concession. (Furthermore, according to news) The Japanese military headquarters in Shanghai, because the Chinese guerrillas in the four suburbs of this city and along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines and Jiabao and other places have been appearing and disappearing unpredictably and repeatedly attacking, making it difficult for the Japanese puppet troops stationed there to cope, in addition to having transferred Japanese and puppet troops to reinforce them, also dispatched a large contingent of Japanese troops yesterday to conduct strict searches of incoming and outgoing boats and land pedestrians in the Beixinjing and Suzhou River and other places. If any discrepancies are found in the passes, the boat people will be detained. In the morning, four civilian boats were detained on the waterway, and two carriers were detained on the land route and taken to the military police headquarters for interrogation.

Wanhua Lou Restaurant Closes Down: Misappropriation and Embezzlement by Assistant Manager; Defendant Requests Postponement of Trial

Wanhua Lou Restaurant in Zhenjiang, Xiaohua Garden, closed down and declared bankruptcy less than a hundred days after its opening, due to unsustainable losses. Mr. Yang Cheng, a shareholder from Suzhou, has obtained several important accounting books and discovered numerous irregularities during his review. He has filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhang Nanxun and Yan Yixing, the other shareholders and assistant managers, alleging misappropriation and other offenses. He claims that he was persuaded by Zhang and others to invest 10,000 yuan in legal tender as a shareholder on December 5th of last year, but the restaurant declared bankruptcy as early as February 2nd. He listed multiple instances of fraud in the accounting books, such as inflated expenses, embezzlement of deposits, misappropriation of deposits, and misuse of checks, requesting that the defendants be prosecuted according to law. The case was scheduled to be heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Shen Bingrong of the Ji Yi Special District Court. Zhang Nanxun submitted a prior statement requesting a postponement because he needed to go to Jiangbei. Yan Yixing's address was incorrect, so the summons could not be delivered. Therefore, neither defendant appeared at the hearing. Only the plaintiff, accompanied by his attorney, appeared in court with the unstamped accounting books and other evidence. Judge Shen ruled that since both defendants' absence was not intentional, he would adjourn the hearing and reschedule it for a later date.

Lun Chang fabric offers all the patterns that customers need in this season with novel styles that never fade. Not only do people love to use it, but also the price is surprisingly cheap, affordable for everyone.

This year's products include the inexpensive and durable "Lun Fang", the finely striped and vibrant "Ma Sha", and also "Ma Fang", which is especially popular among those on the coast. In addition, there are "Fu Chou" and "Zhou Bu", dyed elegantly and sold cheaply. "Fa Si Ge" fabric comes in twenty-four different colors, elegant and beautiful, and is suitable for making shirts and women's clothing. The cheapest of these is Lun Fang, sold for only 45 cents per yard, while the most expensive, Zhou Bu, sells for only 70 cents per yard.

Lun Chang colored fabric becomes more vibrant with washing, with unbelievable durability. Therefore, it is even more suitable for making children's clothing.

烚赤未有做開　人心稍帶疲軟
"Sha Chi" Not Traded; Sentiment Slightly Weak

Yesterday's cash "Sha Chi" grey market conditions, because it was the foreign Qingming holiday, so no members gathered, but a certain gentleman in the money exchange industry said, according to his observation, because the newspaper reported on that day that Italy had implemented an invasion of Albania, so market sentiment was slightly disturbed and uneasy. Based on this, it is speculated that there may be a downward trend at the opening. However, on the other hand, it is inferred that the chips in Shanghai are exhausted. Before the holiday, Hong Kong gangs and foreign merchants searched and purchased quite a bit, and recently merchants have been out of stock, so it is expected that there will be no major problems at the opening. However, today a small number of bulls are intending to sell out at the closing price of 2,068 yuan before the holiday (April 6th), and buyers are willing to absorb it only if it is reduced by seven or eight yuan, but no transactions have been heard. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops has not changed due to the holiday. Da Tong Hang still hangs at the original price of 210 yuan, Xin Tong Hang is 208 yuan, and the purchase price is 202 yuan. The central listing, Customs Gold and Huahai standard gold prices are still flat. The Chinese pure gold buying price is still 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao, because foreign Qingming continues to be on holiday and there is no telegram.

The opening of domestic sugar has not been much for days, but the market situation has turned stable, such as the production price of Shan Cotton White rebounding eight cents before and after, enough to be in the vicinity of 24.56 yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai market is bullish. Over two hundred bags of top ice white opened at 23.89 yuan, and Chao Qing also rose by one or two cents. Over two hundred bags of Huanggang Qing traded at 14.76 yuan to 14.65 yuan. 60 bags of miscellaneous road foreign sugar at 20.4 yuan. The foreign sugar association's listing called for the original price, but as it was a spring holiday, there was not much trading, and the market looked gradually flat.

The market price is slightly looser than before, and sales are scattered.

Yesterday, a certain foreign company in this city had a large batch of Indian Calcutta lump coal, totaling more than 5,000 tons, which arrived at wharves in Pudong and was sold through a certain firm. Peers transshipped, and the price was 38.5 yuan per ton for uniform coal and 40 yuan for lump coal, with the firm handling its own expenses. The price has slightly loosened.

Yesterday, there were also 2,500 tons of coal shipped from Qinhuangdao, and more than 3,000 tons shipped from Hongji.

The soybean market has not changed much during the two-day holiday. The market price has risen slightly by one or two cents compared to before the market closed. Although Dalian beans are affected by control, the rising trend has not been very激昂 under the sluggish sales. Futures beans still have five trades, but the number of transactions is also minute, and the market price is still stable. Yesterday, it was estimated that seven or eight cars of Dalian beans for April delivery were opened, with prices ranging from 8.44 yuan to 8.55 yuan. Spot beans traded four cars, with prices ranging from 8.75 yuan to 8.9 yuan. Over five hundred bags of Chongming sand yellow opened, with prices ranging from 8.66 yuan to 8.8 yuan.

This Year's Tea Market Not Optimistic; Raw Tea Prices Soar, Exceeding Zhen Mei Sales Prices

The tea market of foreign firms in this city has not had large-scale transactions in the past two weeks. The market price has softened compared to the previous few weeks. The market price of core-removed Zhen Mei has returned to 150-160 yuan. The highest price of ordinary Zhen Mei is no more than 120-130 yuan, and the lowest is in the vicinity of 100 yuan. According to the raw tea prices purchased by the tea factory, they all need to be 80-90 yuan to 130-140 yuan. With such raw tea prices, even if the factory produces the above-mentioned market prices, not only is there no profit to be made, but there is also a risk of折閱. There is still a month before the new tea market. Currently, several new brands are being prepared. According to the expectations of general tea merchants, I am afraid that this year's tea business is not allowed to 覜.

Woolen Retail Business Increases; Few Exports of Piece Goods

Recently, woolen spring sales are in season, and the retail business in the Qipan Street area has increased.

工商談助為木炭策將來  培本
Business and Industry Discussing Assistance for Charcoal for the Future  Peiben

A month ago: Due to the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, Japanese warships frequently invaded. The authorities, in order to understand the business difficulties, "prepare for a rainy day",疏攻積貨, allowed the export of local products. Therefore, in the past week, as many as 50,000 to 60,000 loads of Wenzhou charcoal arrived, resulting in sufficient inventory in this city and a sharp reduction in进户. General short-term brokers had to贴佣抛出, to资週轉. The supply exceeded demand, and the盤價 decreased daily. Seeing this situation, the Charcoal Company thought it was not a long-term plan and gathered the charcoal industry in this city to organize a "Charcoal Transportation and Sales Office", limiting the暗盤 and unifying the selling price to avoid unexpected losses. As Yongjiang奉電令, Zhenhai is preparing to封鎖 and prohibit航輪 from operating; if the situation turns tense, Wenzhou will also cut off transportation. If so, the source of charcoal will be obstructed. I believe that

(1) Abolish the Freight Deadline The previous reason for the large number of charcoal shipments from the Charcoal Company, reaching as many as 50,000 to 60,000 loads in a week, was that it was difficult for the Shanghai遝銷處 to sell, so it could only be stacked on the栈, and the填本 was too large to bear. Therefore, it was determined that 后货 should be装申 45 days after the previous goods were sold out. Now that something extraordinary has happened, such as the possible封鎖 of Oujiang, this freight deadline should be abolished, and装运 should be urged as soon as possible to avoid the risk of charcoal断档. As for来货填本, you can contact the banking industry to apply for mortgage loans; or seek it from those in the industry with assets, because those within the industry are familiar with the market situation and are more convenient.

(2) The Distribution of 来货 is also very important. Because "物稀为贵", if Oujiang is封鎖, there is no后货, which will inevitably lead to peers猛力吸收, "积谷防荒", and those who are捷足 will be the first to ascend, and those who arrive later will have no goods to supply to the market. Therefore, the 公会 should allocate it fairly, based on the amount of sales on weekdays, and不得垄断独裁, 苦乐不匀. At the same time; it is strictly forbidden for people outside the industry to purchase, because外行 are mostly囤户, aiming to投机居奇, and cannot circulate in the market.

(3) No Arbitrary Price Increases The cost of the charcoal is already stipulated (see the previous news in this newspaper).除酌加佣金,门庄发客不得任意抬价 to increase the burden on the civilians. I then: The Transportation and Sales Office can stop supplying goods; because垄断居奇 not only hurts commercial ethics, but also is not allowed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

油市
Oil Market

豆油續向高峰邁進　—花生油到湧步穩—
Soybean Oil Continues to Advance to Peak; Peanut Oil Arrivals Surge Steadily

Soybean oil had a two-day holiday and demand inevitably became lively. Therefore, in the state of declining inventory, it moved forward, and prices all saw the latest high. Dalian oil is close to the 40 yuan mark, and its potential is still brewing due to the control problem, and it will inevitably break out of the mark. The futures Japanese merchants still have no clear statement, so there is no solution in sight for the overall situation. Yesterday, more than 400 barrels of spot Dalian oil opened, and the price rose from 38 yuan to 39.6 yuan at the close. 250 pieces of Yanqi oil traded at 29 yuan. Suifeng Factory oil opened at 200 loads at 38 yuan. Peanut oil sources saw an increase and the sales were also slightly active. Also, because the price of soybean oil continued to rise, the market was in good shape. Yesterday, 250 pieces of Jiaozhou oil traded at 32 yuan, slightly up by 5 cents from before the holiday. 2,000 tins of Yantai canned oil traded at 41 yuan. 200 of Tianjin canned oil traded at 39.8 yuan, and 10 buckets of Qingdao barrel oil traded at 44 yuan.

紗花
Yarn and Cotton

紗價回振之中由來　春初曾一度紊亂
The Reason for the Rebound of Yarn Prices; There Was Once a Period of Chaos in Early Spring

Since the beginning of this year's red market, the cotton yarn market has been in a state of不畅 need, disappointing spring sales. In addition, since the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, merchants in the South China area have been threatened by it. As a result, the bulls were discouraged, and the market price showed a 趦趄 unstable phenomenon. As for the囤户 and the financial world, in view of the unfavorable environment, the desire to cut and結之心 emerged spontaneously, and the falling wind was particularly strong. On March 28, rumors started to spread in the market, and people were uncertain and unsettled. The bank's囤货 first broke out, and the market felt more充濫. After that, Nanchang was abandoned, and the hands were worried,脱卸允切. There was a large unstable situation, and sellers continued to come, so the market price had a messy phenomenon for a time. The minimum peak price for the 現货 of 20-count Double Horse Yarn was 363.5 yuan.

大跌後引起實銷
The Sharp Decline Led to Actual Sales

Unexpectedly, after the price dropped sharply, it led to the development of actual sales. Hong Kong, Yunnan and other places came to採办 again. The transportation vehicles that the national government purchased overseas have already arrived in China and have been allocated for use. With this, the transportation from Kunming to Chongqing is敏捷, and they are purchasing cotton yarn in large quantities there. With the arrival of actual sales, the market price immediately横跳. As for Chaoshan, they also came to採办 because the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was hindered and stagnated by military influence. Now, they are changed to inland waterway transshipment to Shantou, and the help is also showing signs of improvement. Therefore, in these recent three days, the yarn market, which had been tired and lifeless for a long time, turned from weak to strong, and the highest price once reached 391 yuan. It is estimated that there are several reasons for this rebound in 20-count yarn, as follows:

At the closing price at the end of last year, the上身货 of 10-count coarse yarn was at 294-295 yuan, the中身货 price was at 290 yuan. The上身货 price of 32-count single yarn was around 500 yuan, and the中身 was between 480 and 490 yuan. The price of 42-count double-strand line was in the vicinity of 530-540 yuan. Unexpectedly, since the red market opened, the 念 count yarn has fallen step by step, and the decline of 10-count coarse yarn has been緩, and 32-count single yarn has not only not fallen, but has even advanced. There was once a sharp rise in the market. Not long ago, the Japanese factories had already given up producing this number of cotton yarn. The Chinese factories did not work even if the 20-count yarn was popular at ordinary times, and the囤户 were not暇 and to this unpopular product. Unexpectedly, the Jin帮 from the north suddenly came to purchase, and all the goods on the market were taken away by them. The factory's额子 was also搜罗殆尽 by them. As a result, the market price rose steadily, and only 20-count yarn was lifeless.

華日紗已近軋平
Chinese and Japanese Yarn Are Nearing Equalization

Recently, Japanese yarn has been affected by the Qingdao exchange轧空. The households who shorted and lost money in Qingdao came to Shanghai to濫拖, so the Japanese yarn and cloth have been rising day and night. A portion of 20-count Chinese yarn has been leveled with Japanese yarn.

### Inside the Chao Hui Villa in the Nanshi Area, a Large Cache of Weapons Was Unearthed: Four Boxes of Landmines, Twenty-Seven Boxes of Hand Grenades

A large cache of weapons was unearthed in the Nanshi area the other day by the Japanese. Details have been ascertained as follows: at 10:40 AM on the morning of the date in question, the bogus "Nanshi Police Bureau Detective Squad" received a tip from an informant stating that a large cache of weapons was buried near the Wenxing Pavilion of the Guangdong Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road, Luban Road in the Nanshi area, etc. Upon receiving this report, the "squad" immediately reported it to Yoshiota, the Japanese advisor of the bogus "bureau," who immediately dispatched the bogus squad leader, accompanied by six bogus officers, along with four members of the Japanese advisory military police led by Captain Yoshioka, to conduct an inspection. They dug up a large, withered tree next to the Wenxing Pavilion. After excavating the soil to a depth of about one foot, they discovered a burial mound. After further excavation, they discovered four boxes of landmines, each containing six large landmines, and twenty-seven boxes of hand grenades, each containing twenty hand grenades. However, the hand grenades were taken away by Yoshioka. The landmines, due to the fear of danger, were moved to an empty room in the villa, pending re-examination by the Japanese military police, after which they would be moved for destruction, it is said.

Furthermore, it is reported that the Jingjiang Public Hall outside the old Ximen Gate in the Nanshi area, an organization for natives of Zhenjiang residing in Shanghai, has a long history and is quite substantial in scale. After the war, the hall suffered considerable losses, and there were still two thousand coffins stored inside that had not been transported out. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the morning of the seventh day of the month, the Japanese troops in the Nanshi area received a report from a Chinese traitor stating that a large cache of weapons was secretly hidden inside. They specially dispatched four Japanese soldiers, accompanied by the traitor and seven ignorant laborers, carrying hoes and axes, to open the coffins for inspection. After ten coffins were pried open, a rifle and seven hundred rounds of rifle ammunition were found in the coffin of a certain woman. The Japanese soldiers believed that weapons were indeed hidden, so they insisted on opening all the coffins for inspection. After the caretakers of the hall requested it, they were temporarily spared, and the Japanese soldiers left in disappointment.

### Residents of North Fujian Road Disturbed by Dung Carts: Request the Health Department to Find Ways to Disperse Them, Shorten the Time, and Crack Down on Broken Carts

The 37th and 15th District Branches of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation jointly sent a letter to the Health Department of the Public Works Department yesterday, which stated: "To whom it may concern, according to the statements made to our Federation by the shops on North Fujian Road, because this road is close to the Suzhou Road dung wharf, dung carts are passing continuously from 4:00 AM to 11:00 AM, almost turning the road into a thoroughfare for dung carts. As a result, pedestrians mostly detour, causing intangible losses to businesses. Moreover, many dung carts are broken, causing leakage all over the ground. Accumulating bit by bit, the foul odor lingers for a long time, causing great harm to the hygiene of the residents. Please find ways to eliminate this situation. Since the location of the dung wharf is designated by the Public Works Department in a suitable place, it is difficult to change. However, the routing of the dung carts could be dispersed to various roads, the time could be shortened, and broken carts should be banned, so that businesses are not particularly disadvantaged on North Fujian Road alone. We hereby request your department to investigate and immediately disperse the routing of the dung carts and crack down on broken vehicles, for the benefit of the residents and the public good."

### Woman Attempts Suicide by Poisoning After Gambling Loss

A Ningbo woman, Chen Pan, aged twenty-four, residing at No. 45 Zhizhong Lane, Xixinqiao Street, has recently frequented gambling dens in western Shanghai, incurring huge gambling debts. Last night, she wanted to go to a certain gambling den again, but was stopped by her husband. As a result, she had an argument with her husband, and afterwards, secretly swallowed raw opium in an attempt to commit suicide.

### Bloody Case in a Prostitute's House: Patron and Prostitute Murdered, Throats Slashed, Both Dead: Suicide or Murder Still Under Investigation

The area between Zhejiang Road and Zhifu Road in the Public Concession, commonly known as Stealing Chicken Bridge, is a place where, whenever the lights come on, countless powdered and rouged young women can be seen standing on the streets, soliciting customers in soft voices, or leaning on doors, smiling and beckoning for their patrons. Therefore, although it is known as a place of pleasure, it is actually a hell on earth. The life stories of the people here are mostly tragically inhumane. No. 4 Zhifu Road is this type of hidden den, also known as a pheasant prostitute's house. Among them is a pheasant prostitute named Wang Suolan, just twenty years old, who has been receiving customers in this house for a long time, dealing with both regular and new patrons, and suffering the hardship of being trampled upon. However, she thought that her youth was fleeting, and she thought about choosing someone to marry. It is said that a fruit vendor had a close relationship with Wang and had plans to redeem her from prostitution. However, due to numerous twists and turns, the dream had not come true. The evening before last, the fruit vendor went to Wang's place for pleasure again. At that time, because he was a regular customer, the other prostitutes did not pay attention. Until yesterday morning, the madam of the house saw that neither of them had gotten up, and when she called for Wang, there was no response for a long time. She became very suspicious and pushed the door open to look inside. She was shocked to scream because both men and women were already lying stiff in a pool of blood, dead for a long time. The madam was extremely anxious and immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. They discovered that the throats of both men and women had been slashed with sharp blades and died. The two corpses were sent to the morgue for autopsy, and an investigation was launched to find out the truth, so as to handle the case.
