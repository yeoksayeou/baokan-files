### Large Numbers of Chinese Aircraft Fly to Hankou; Three Bombing Raids on Japanese-Occupied Airfields; Hundreds of Bombs Dropped, Over a Hundred Japanese Aircraft Completely Destroyed; Ammunition Depots Also Hit, Explosions Continuous for Three Hours; Chinese Forces on Xiangbei Front Reach Dasha Ping in Southern Hubei

Location Undisclosed. The glorious and magnificent war record of the Chinese Shenying (Divine Eagle) unit continuing its fierce bombing of the Hankou airfield on the 3rd of this month, destroying more than fifty Japanese aircraft, hundreds of barrels of gasoline, and killing over one hundred thirty Japanese airmen, on the 14th, once again using several [unclear] squadrons of Shenrui (Divine Sharpness) bombers, divided into [unclear] large formations, commanded separately by Unit Leader [unclear] and Unit Leader [unclear], carrying [unclear] tons of bombs, in the clear autumn sky, with an imposing array, directly targeted the Japanese air force assembly point at the Hankou airfield, which had been harassing the Chinese rear for days. When the Chinese aircraft arrived over the target, amidst the welcoming cheers of the people of the Three Towns, with a vast and orderly formation, they flew over the airfield, discovering two Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, which, seeing the Divine Eagles approaching, did not dare to engage and fled in panic. The first Chinese formation immediately aimed at the large group of Japanese aircraft parked at the airfield and the aircraft factory, calmly dropping hundreds of huge bombs. As dust and smoke rose, several fires were seen burning fiercely. The second formation followed, continuously dropping [unclear] tons of huge bombs on the main oil and ammunition depot, each hitting its target. The sound of the explosions shook the entire city. Instantly, flames soared into the sky and thick smoke covered the ground. Bombs exploded on gasoline, and the sound of falling explosions was as dense as a string of pearls. Gasoline caught fire due to flying shrapnel, and the blazing flames shot up into the sky. The third Chinese formation also targeted the airfield and various military facilities, frequently inflicting immense losses on the Japanese with [unclear] tons of huge bombs. The airfield occupied by the Japanese was almost completely turned into scorched earth. After completing their mission, the Chinese aircraft, amidst the cheers of the people of the Three Towns, flew wing-to-wing on their return journey. Suddenly, more than twenty Japanese fighter planes pursued to challenge them. The Chinese aircraft, with a dense web of fire, attacked them, driving the Japanese aircraft back from the vicinity of Yichang, and shooting down three Japanese aircraft on the spot. Two Chinese planes were also lightly damaged by Japanese bullets, but both returned safely. (14th Dispatch)

Chongqing. Chinese air force heroes once again flew to Hankou on the 14th, launching a large-scale bombing raid on the Japanese-occupied airfield, inflicting a heavy blow before triumphantly returning. On the morning of the 14th, the autumn sky was high and clear, without a cloud in sight. The Chinese air force Shenying Brigade × Team officers and men, each with a full chest of enthusiasm and a calm attitude, took off from an undisclosed location, flew eastward, majestically traversing thousands of miles of beautiful mountains and rivers, heading towards their destination. After a while, the Chinese Shenying Brigade, amidst the jubilation of the people of the Three Towns of Wuhan, arrived over Wuhan. At that time, there were two Japanese fighter planes on aerial patrol. Suddenly, they saw the Chinese Shenying Brigade flying wing-to-wing, with a formidable military appearance. The Japanese aircraft, seeing the situation, were extremely frightened, dared not engage, and immediately fled. The brave Chinese air force did not pursue them, and instead divided into three groups of aircraft, advancing towards the airfield in sequence. At 12:13, the first Shenying aircraft group fired fiercely by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery, entered the airfield. At that time, there were many Japanese aircraft parked inside the field, numbering over a hundred. The Chinese officers and men then displayed their skills, fully exploiting the explosive power, and indeed, every bomb hit its mark. In an instant, the entire airfield was engulfed in flames, the raging fire soaring into the sky. Almost all of the Japanese aircraft in the field were burned to the ground. At 12:20, the second Chinese Shenying aircraft group calmly followed, entering the airspace above the airfield. After quickly finding their targets, they dropped a large number of explosive bombs. This time, the Japanese ammunition depot was hit by the Chinese in one strike. Immediately, thick smoke and dust soared into the sky. The ammunition inside the depot also exploded, and the sound of roaring explosions continued for three or four hours. At 12:30, the third Chinese Shenying aircraft group soared over the city of Hankou, aiming at their targets and dropping even more explosive bombs, thoroughly destroying the Japanese military facilities. Subsequently, more than twenty Japanese aircraft took off to intercept them, and fierce aerial combat occurred over a certain area. When the fierce battle reached its most intense point, five Japanese aircraft were indeed shot down by the Chinese. However, two Chinese aircraft were also hit and damaged, but they still safely flew near after repelling the Japanese aircraft. The Japanese aircraft pursued as far as the vicinity of Yichang, where they were bravely repelled by the Chinese. It is reported that the Japanese-occupied Hankou airfield was almost completely destroyed after being heavily bombed by the Chinese air force, and almost all of the aircraft parked inside the field were also destroyed. (14th Dispatch)

Chongqing. According to a statement made by the Chinese spokesman today, Chinese aircraft bombed the Japanese airfield in Hankou in three waves today. Approximately one hundred Japanese aircraft were completely destroyed. The Japanese ammunition depot was also razed to the ground. The sound of explosions lasted for two or three hours. This is the second time in two weeks that Chinese aircraft have bombed the Japanese airfield in Hankou. The first time was on October 3rd. According to reports, the result of the large-scale bombing of the Hankou airfield by Chinese aircraft at that time was the destruction of fifty Japanese aircraft and a large amount of gasoline. The Chinese spokesman was so overjoyed that he wept when reporting this news to reporters. The first wave of Chinese aircraft bombed the Japanese airfield in Hankou at 12:13 this afternoon, blasting countless craters into the field and destroying many Japanese aircraft on the ground. The second wave arrived over the city of Hankou at 12:20, focusing on bombing the Japanese ammunition depot. The sound of explosions afterwards lasted for two or three hours without ceasing. The third wave of Chinese aircraft, the main force, appeared over the Japanese airfield and dropped hundreds of bombs on it. According to the pilots looking down, the Japanese airfield had been completely destroyed, and all one hundred Japanese aircraft on the airfield had been destroyed without remainder. When the third wave of Chinese aircraft completed its mission, twenty Japanese fighter planes arrived from other airfields and pursued the Chinese aircraft, engaging in aerial combat that continued until they reached a point two hundred miles west of Yichang, and can be described as the fiercest aerial combat since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. It is reported that three Japanese aircraft were shot down by Chinese aircraft, and two Chinese aircraft were shot down, with several others damaged. (14th United Press Dispatch)

All Chinese aircraft returned safely to their original defenses. The first wave of bombers appeared in the skies over Hankou at 12:13 PM, fiercely bombing the airfield and destroying many Japanese aircraft in the field. Seven minutes later, the second wave of Chinese aircraft arrived in the skies over Hankou, bombing the ammunition depot and causing it to catch fire and explode. The third wave of Chinese bombers, the largest in number, attacked Hankou at around 12:30 PM. However, details of this attack are not yet known. According to official sources here, the third and largest wave of bombers also bombed the airfield, dropping many bombs, causing large fires both inside and outside the field.

According to Chinese telegrams received here today, after the Chinese army recaptured Yanglousi, an important station on the Yuezhou-Hankou Railway northeast of Yuezhou, this morning, they are now threatening the rear of the Japanese forces occupying Yuezhou and Tongcheng. Chinese military circles believe that the Japanese forces in southern Hubei may be forced to retreat towards Puqi. Chinese troops are advancing towards Yuezhou, while one Chinese force is attacking the east of Yuezhou, having captured Taolin, surrounded Yuezhou, and the Chinese forces attacking Tongcheng have completed the encirclement of the city. Another Chinese force bypassed Tongcheng and has reached Dasha Ping, north of Tongcheng and between Chongyang and Tongcheng. The main force of the Japanese army is currently retreating towards Puqi.

(14th Dispatch)

Chongqing. Since Yanglousi, on the Yuezhou-Hankou Railway northeast of Yuezhou, was recaptured by the Chinese side, the battle situation has once again changed. Because after Yanglousi was recaptured by the Chinese army, the Japanese army's land communications to the rear have been cut off. From now on, the supply of food and ammunition can only be done by water. At the same time, the vanguard of the Chinese army has already approached Yuezhou, so the position of the Japanese army there is extremely precarious. (14th United Press Dispatch)

Miluo. A part of the Japanese Inaba Division retreating to Yueyang has suffered over two company casualties due to continuous attacks by the Chinese army in recent days.

Editorial

### The Finnish Question

Yesterday, this newspaper reviewed the recent actions of the Soviet Union; now, let us further discuss the Finnish question.

The Finnish question is of course inseparable from the Baltic Sea question. If you open a map, you can see that in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea there is a Gulf of Finland that is indented by about 500 kilometers. To the north of the Gulf of Finland is the country of Finland; to the south, from north to south, are the three small countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; the Soviet Union is locked at the eastern end of the Gulf of Finland; while at the other western outer mouth lies the Åland Islands, composed of more than 300 islands of various sizes. The Åland Islands not only control the Gulf of Finland, but also control the entire Baltic Sea, because the Baltic Sea looks like a T-shape, and the Åland Islands are located at the three-way intersection of the T-shape—and now the sovereignty of these islands also belongs to Finland.

If we turn to a map from before World War I, we will know that Finland and the three small countries were all former territories of Imperial Russia. After the Russian Revolution, they successively declared independence, and the great powers, in order to prevent the development of Soviet socialist power, supported their independence under the principle of national self-determination, isolating the Soviet Union from the Baltic Sea. If it is said that the great powers deliberately gave Poland a corridor to the sea, then undoubtedly it was also deliberate to only allow the Soviet Union to have a very short coastline bordering the Gulf of Finland. Moreover, after the war, in order to strictly prevent communism, they not only subsidized Germany to revive it, but also once encouraged those newly emerging Baltic countries to organize an anti-Russian front line, taking on the task of a frontline outpost for other countries to prevent communism.

The Soviet Union is a socialist country, and of course it does not oppose national independence; but Russia, which has always controlled half of the Baltic Sea, now only maintains an extremely pitiful corner in the Gulf of Finland, which is not necessarily a suffocating and unbearable thing. And even if these newly emerging countries themselves do not threaten the Soviet Union, it is not unexpected that the great powers may use them to threaten the Soviet Union. For example, the Åland Islands originally belonged to Sweden, but were later seized by Imperial Russia. After the Great War, Sweden wanted to demand the return of these islands, but the great powers refused to grant them, only allowing them to belong to Finland, so as to play a greater role in the anti-Russian front line; initially, this place was stipulated as a demilitarized zone, but recently Finland intends to build defenses in this place, which the great powers have supported, but the Soviet Union feels a major threat. Therefore, although the Soviet Union does not necessarily want to destroy these newly emerging countries, it may still hope to reduce the threat to itself.

Now that the Polish question has come to an end, and the agreements signed between the three small countries and the Soviet Union have also been completed one after another, then in the Baltic Sea region, only the Finnish question has not been resolved. This is the reason why the Soviet Union is excessively demanding negotiations with Finland. However, the situation of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is obviously very different from that of the three small countries, and seems to be very tense. For example, Finland itself is deeply wary. Representative Paasikivi has just departed for the Soviet Union, but Finland has already made military preparations, as if anticipating that the negotiations will definitely break down. Also, the Nordic countries, hearing about the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, are also in a state of anxiety, fearing that once Finland succumbs, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark will all feel the crisis of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold." Furthermore, the United States, which is far away in the Western Hemisphere and has recently not interfered in European affairs in its actions, is sparing no effort to advise the Soviet Union not to despise Finland's independence. These phenomena can indicate that Finland's independence is not only highly valued by itself, but also particularly valued internationally. Why is this? Originally, Finland's geographical location is different from that of the three small countries such as Lithuania. The territory of the three small countries is currently included within the territory of the Soviet Union, so their fate and international relations are less involved, and independence and neutrality are out of the question. As for Finland's territory, it does not only border the Soviet Union; its fate can affect other countries, so the international community not only needs it to be independent, but also needs it to be neutral. Furthermore, Finland is indeed a handsome nation, with a relatively strong national consciousness and a relatively strong national strength. Although the current military preparations may be demonstrative in nature, they may also cause a new dispute. One more thing, since the Finnish question is the last question in the Baltic Sea, of course, the resolution of the Finnish question is the strengthening of the Soviet Union's control over the Baltic Sea, which is a very worrying thing in the eyes of countries that have always been suspicious of the Soviet Union. In short, the tension accompanying the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is nothing more than a manifestation of complex international psychology.

We do not need to speculate too much on the future of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, but on the Finnish side, it needs to maintain independence and neutrality, and on the Soviet side, it needs to reduce the threat to itself. These two wishes are not without a path to a satisfactory solution. The authorities of the two countries cannot be ignorant of this!

### Europe on the Brink of War and Peace; Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy to Hold Trilateral Consultations; Berlin Holds All-Night Meeting to Discuss War Plans; Germany Expresses Frustration and Unease After Peace Offer Rejected

Berlin. According to news from the Nazi Party last night, due to the failure of Hitler's peace plan, Germany will immediately hold a trilateral conference with the Soviet Union and Italy to discuss "matters of common defense." Germany's only goal now is to win victory in the final battle with Britain and France, so as to restore European peace. Hitler met all night yesterday with his [unclear] members and personnel from the army, navy, and air force to discuss continued war plans. Authoritative sources claimed last night that Soviet People's Commissar Molotov and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive in Berlin to begin trilateral consultations to decide on a plan to stop the war by military means. German officials said that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons was an insult to Germany. An authoritative German government spokesman still said that peace was hopeless, only saying that in Hitler's parliamentary speech, he asked all peace-loving people for a reply. As of today, there has been no reply, and the German government can no longer wait any longer. (14th United Press Dispatch)

The Hague. After the Prime Ministers of Britain and France delivered their speeches one after another, many Dutch newspapers said that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union would hold talks. The "Evening News" carried a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, saying, "German political figures all say that according to the treaties signed between Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union should hold political and military talks in Berlin in the short term, even within 48 hours. The Soviet representative may be People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, and the Italian representative may be Foreign Minister Ciano. German newspapers continue to attack Britain, saying that it should be held responsible for prolonging the war." The "Evening News" also said, "Last night, Berlin was filled with an atmosphere of indignation and unease, but it was also believed that the situation had not yet reached the end of the road, and it was still hoped that neutral countries could come forward to mediate at the last minute to avoid disaster.

In addition, after the Soviet Union expanded its power along the Baltic coast, German officials are extremely worried, believing that German interests have been harmed. The Baltic coast was originally within Germany's sphere of influence. Now, even if it is not completely lost, it has to allow a strong neighbor to share a portion. Although the German Foreign Ministry says that it is not interested in the incidents that have occurred along the Baltic coast, this is indeed helpless, just a consolation. In fact, people in the country's army and navy are very angry." (14th Havas Dispatch)

Berlin. Regarding rumors that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are about to hold talks, the Foreign Ministry here said that they knew nothing about it. (14th Havas Dispatch)

Stockholm. Swedish newspapers' dispatches from Berlin all reported in detail on the situation of the Nazi military administrative meeting after British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, saying that those who participated in the discussion, Hitler, Air Force Minister Göring, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, all acknowledged that after careful study of the British Prime Minister's speech, they did not find any suggestions for negotiating with Germany based on Hitler's conditions, and finally decided to adopt a plan to continue fighting. Immediately, residents of dozens of towns in the Rhineland were ordered to evacuate. Hitler may go to the Western Front in person on Saturday or Sunday to supervise the war, but the German army's general offensive may not be launched immediately. The German authorities claim that they are now focusing their naval power to destroy British shipping. They have controlled the North Sea, and German warships are now luring British warships to a place where German bombers can attack them. At the same time, the German government is still relying on the Soviet Union. Germany has not yet said a word about the Finnish issue, which is proof of this. Germany and the Soviet Union are currently starting discussions in Moscow, planning to have Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov or Defense Minister Voroshilov travel to Berlin, or have German officials travel to Moscow, so as to continue the German-Soviet cooperation initiated by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In some circumstances, the Soviet Union will maintain neutrality from beginning to end, avoiding war with Britain and France, and actively engaging in commerce, indirectly benefiting Germany. The German officials in charge seem to be satisfied with this approach by the Soviet Union. The German Foreign Ministry is also closely watching the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. According to news from Berlin, judging from the telegrams from the capitals of the Soviet Union and Turkey, the Soviet-Turkish treaty is about to be completed. Although Turkey's relationship with Western European countries will not be interrupted by this, Soviet interests can still cover up Turkey's relationship with Britain and France. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

Brussels. According to news from Berlin, German observers said that when Führer Hitler made various peace proposals a few days ago, he said that what was said here was the final word. If it was rejected, there would be no more suggestions. Although British Prime Minister Chamberlain has firmly rejected this proposal, the Führer's speech was not only aimed at the enemy countries. Because [unclear] must wait for the reaction of the neutral countries to Chamberlain's expression. In other words, the proposals made by Germany are directed at the countries of the world, and this point still remains, and it is still necessary to wait for the neutral countries to take action. Führer Hitler's desire for peace will not be completely dispelled by Britain's negative answer. However, if the neutral countries turn a deaf ear, then they will not be able to escape responsibility after the outbreak of war in the future. It is a real situation that Germany cannot wait forever, but people in the country's political circles refuse to explain how long it can wait, only saying that while everything is still uncertain, the German government does not intend to immediately consult the Soviet Union.

### The Soviet Plan is Still Moderate; Optimism for Soviet-Finnish Negotiations; Three Nordic Countries Express Deep Concern to the Soviet Union; President Roosevelt's Appeal Remains Unanswered

Helsinki: The Finnish government published an official gazette stating, "The Finnish government believes there is still a possibility for negotiations with Moscow, hoping the Soviet-Finnish issue can be resolved in a reasonable manner." Finnish President Kallio, in view of the national emergency, invoked national defense laws, ordering every citizen to undertake national defense and security work. The President also issued emergency police regulations in preparation for the possibility of war. The Cabinet is studying the Soviet plan. Although the situation is tense, the nature of the Soviet plan still allows for continued negotiations. (October 13, Associated Press)

Swiss Capital: Negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union have begun in Moscow. According to news from Helsinki, the country's attitude remains firm, but the general public is more optimistic about the future of the talks and is very grateful for the mediation efforts of the United States and the governments of the Scandinavian Peninsula. (October 13, Havas)

Swedish Capital: According to a German news agency, Helsinki is gradually becoming optimistic about the outcome of the ongoing Soviet-Finnish talks in Moscow. Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko told guests that the Finnish people were greatly heartened by the news of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark's representations to the Soviet Union. When news reporters inquired about the Soviet Union's demands on Finland, the Finnish Intelligence Bureau only stated that the Finnish delegation in Moscow had received a memorandum from Stalin, but it was not an ultimatum. Last night, the Finnish Foreign Ministry studied a telegram from the Finnish Chief Representative Paasikivi until this morning. It is said that Germany refused to rebroadcast Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko's speech on Thursday night to the Americas due to Soviet pressure. A local newspaper reprinted a Moscow dispatch from the German "Frankfurter Zeitung," stating that the first demands made by the Soviet Union to Finland were relatively moderate, but included a clause requiring administrative cooperation on the Åland Islands. (October 14, Reuters)

Moscow: Responsible parties here recently confirmed that the ambassadors of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, the three countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, to the Soviet Union, separately delivered notes to the Soviet government yesterday, expressing deep concern about the talks between the Soviet Union and Finland. It is still unknown what the three countries will do. In addition, after the Finnish representatives held talks with the Soviet authorities yesterday, they telegraphed the government for instructions. As they have not yet received instructions, it will be difficult to continue the talks tonight. Foreign observers commented that the talks between the Soviet Union and Finland would take longer than the talks between the Soviet Union and the Baltic countries, because Finnish representative Paasikivi does not have full authority and must consult with the government at any time. (October 13, Havas)

Helsinki: Foreign observers believe that Sweden has expressed its willingness to fully support Finland's negotiations in Moscow. Some even say that Finland and Sweden will conclude a military alliance. (October 14, Hai Tong Telegraph)

Washington: President Roosevelt stated today that the United States' representations to the Soviet Union regarding Finnish affairs only express the United States' attention and hope that it will not take actions that disrupt the peaceful relations in the Baltic Sea or Finnish independence. This representation should not be seen as pressure from the United States. (October 13, Reuters)

Washington: President Roosevelt announced yesterday that the document he sent to the Soviet Union was a private appeal to Soviet Chairman Kalinin. He has not yet received a response from the Soviet side, but the Soviet side has acknowledged receiving the document. The document, requesting the Soviet government not to interfere in Finnish independence, was submitted by the U.S. Ambassador to Moscow, Steinhardt, to the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov. He said that the United States does not want to take any action that could be seen as interfering in Soviet actions in the Baltic Sea, so he will not publish the original text of the document. (October 13, Associated Press)

Washington: Finnish Ambassador to the United States, Procope, visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday. The content of the conversation was not announced. (October 14, Associated Press)

### Lloyd George: Plea for Peace; Believes the British Prime Minister's Remarks Add Nothing to the Facts

London: Lloyd George, chairman of the British "Peace Reconstruction Society," launched a nationwide "Tugun" movement today and convened the first general meeting to resolve various issues. The "Peace Reconstruction Society" passed a resolution, stating that Chamberlain's speech clearly adds nothing to the facts, so it is best to convene an international peace conference to prevent excessive emotional stimulation. (October 14, Associated Press)

Note: This "Peace Reconstruction Society" was founded by Lloyd George a few years ago and is not affiliated with any major political party. During elections, this society often opposes the government party and supports Labor candidates.

### Chamberlain Did Not Deliver a Speech Last Night

London: Officials have recently announced that reports that Prime Minister Chamberlain was scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech tonight are untrue. (October 14, Havas)

### Germany Does Not Intend to Ask the US to Mediate Peace; Roosevelt Refuses to Criticize Hitler's Proposal

Berlin: The German official news agency recently denied the claim that Germany has appealed to U.S. President Roosevelt to mediate the war. It is said that Germany has neither made such an appeal nor intends to do so. (October 14, Reuters)

Washington: President Roosevelt declared that he had not received formal notification from the German government regarding its peace proposals, so he could not offer any criticism on the matter. (October 13, Reuters)

Swiss Capital: It has recently been learned that the head of the German Propaganda Office, Dietrich, made a statement to a reporter from a Dutch newspaper, stating that the European war can only be avoided if neutral countries, including the United States, come forward to mediate. (October 13, Havas)

Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the head of the Propaganda Office, Dietrich, said to foreign reporters today that the Western European war could only be avoided if U.S. President Roosevelt came forward to mediate. Foreign parties have misinterpreted this statement, claiming that Director Dietrich intended to appeal to President Roosevelt to mediate. This is obviously a fabrication. In fact, although this was a private conversation, it is not permissible to misinterpret it at will. (October 13, Havas)

London: Sources with close ties to the Vatican report that the Holy See is not prepared to use Hitler's speech as a basis for advocating peace negotiations. (October 14, Reuters)

### The Transfer of Polish Territory to Other Countries is Not Endorsed by the UK

London: It is reported that the British government has explained to the Lithuanian government that, as the United Kingdom is an ally of Poland, the British government cannot endorse the transfer of Polish territory to other countries. Therefore, the British government cannot recognize the transfer of the Vilnius province to Lithuania under the Soviet-Lithuanian treaty. However, the general public here acknowledges that Lithuania's acquisition of Vilnius cannot be compared to the German-Soviet partition of Poland, nor can it be strongly condemned as Germany and the Soviet Union were, due to the following two reasons: (1) The Soviet-Lithuanian treaty was signed by Lithuania under Soviet duress. If the Soviet Union compensates Lithuania for the loss of its independence with some land, it is hardly blameworthy for Lithuania to accept this land. (2) The Polish residents of Vilnius under Lithuanian administration may be better off than under Soviet or German rule. (October 14, Reuters)

### Soviet-Turkish Negotiations Continue; Agreement Imminent; Neutralization of the Tatar Strait Does Not Conflict with the Interests of Britain and France

Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu held another meeting with Soviet leaders last night. It is expected that the Soviet Union and Turkey will conclude a treaty soon. Well-informed sources here believe that the treaty will take the form of a mutual assistance treaty, with Turkey undertaking to neutralize the Tatar Strait. The treaty will not conflict with the interests of Britain and France. (October 10, Reuters)

Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu went to the Kremlin at 5:00 PM for talks with Soviet government officials, which lasted for two hours. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu has been here for nearly three weeks, but this is only the second time he has met with Soviet authorities. According to foreign observers, the Soviet authorities no longer insist that Turkey must remain neutral if war breaks out in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the talks between the two sides will now be accelerated, and an agreement will be reached in a short period of time that takes into account the interests of both the Soviet Union and Turkey, while not hindering the interests held by Britain and France. In addition, Foreign Minister Saracoğlu has maintained close contact with the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and the French Chargé d'affaires, Payart. (October 13, Havas)

### Meeting of Heads of State of Four Nordic Countries to be Held in Stockholm on Wednesday

Swedish Capital: Swedish King Gustav V has invited Danish King Christian X, Norwegian King Haakon VII, and Finnish President Kallio to hold a meeting in Stockholm on October 18th. The heads of state of each country have already agreed to attend, and will also be accompanied by their foreign ministers.

### UK Policy of Stabilizing Chinese Legal Tender Unchanged

London: According to Reuters sources, the news broadcast by German radio stations that Britain has canceled its support for Chinese legal tender is inaccurate. The British government has repeatedly announced in Parliament recently that it has no intention of changing its policy towards Chinese legal tender, as maintaining the exchange rate value of Chinese legal tender is in the interests of all countries trading with China. The fund established by the British government-guaranteed loan to stabilize Chinese legal tender still exists. (October 14, Reuters)

London: It is reported that to date, a total of 23 neutral merchant ships have been sunk by German mines or submarines. In addition, nine Swedish ships are being held in Gothenburg due to the risk of hitting German mines.

Due to adverse weather conditions, the British Allied forces will not launch a large-scale offensive this year and will wait until the spring of 1940 to launch a major offensive. This move will greatly benefit the Allied forces, as Hitler must achieve a quick victory and cannot wait until next spring. The British Air Force has secretly completed its reorganization. Six weeks ago, the British government sent several experts to Poland to inspect the German Air Force's war record. This reorganization is based on their report. (October 14, Associated Press)

The British government does not restrict nationality, but does not wish to organize foreign legions like the Polish or Czech armies that France has. In this war, we have abolished all distinctions within the army and made it a single army, he said. The Secretary of State also stated that French military experts pointed out that the British Expeditionary Force's transport to France, without any unexpected incidents, was the greatest marching achievement and the first victory of the Allies in this war. In fact, this achievement was not only unknown to the Germans, but also unheard of by the French at first. (Reuters, 13th)

### Germans Withdraw from the Baltic Sea; British Newspaper Comments on German Policy as Encountering a Second Failure

London - Today's "The Times" stated that the German withdrawal from the Baltic Sea is the second major failure of the Nazi Party's policy since the outbreak of war. The first blow to the Nazi Party's policy was the miscalculation of its plan to annex Poland, which led to the alienation of the countries in southeastern Europe, all of whom are now looking to Moscow for guidance. The newspaper continued that this second failure seems to have a greater impact on the Nazi Party's prestige in Europe, as the Baltic coastal countries have had close ties with Prussia for centuries. The newspaper concluded that it goes without saying which force will replace Germany's position after its withdrawal. (Reuters, 14th)

### Soviet Economic Assistance to Germany; Limited Scope of Economic Agreement

"New York Shipping News" - Since the establishment of the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, exporters here who have been trading with the Soviet Union for 20 years have been very skeptical of the rumors that the Soviet Union can provide large-scale economic assistance to Germany. It is generally believed that the economic agreement was signed before the treaty of non-aggression was concluded, and its provisions are quite limited. It would be fortunate if the Soviet Union could fulfill it. Because the Soviet Union needs to import large quantities of goods from foreign countries to meet domestic needs. For example, the rumors that the Soviet Union is preparing to supply Germany with kerosene to help it fight the war are exaggerated. Kerosene is one of the Soviet Union's major imports. How can it be expected to supply it to Germany? According to the economic agreement signed by the two countries in August, the Soviet Union should exchange various raw materials for various German manufactured goods, with a minimum amount of US$36 million in the next two years. But one thing that people outside the Soviet Union have not paid attention to is that its significance is extremely important, that is, the Soviet government recently issued an order authorizing the People's Committee for Foreign Trade to cancel or suspend the implementation of this commercial agreement if it encounters difficulties in the implementation of commercial terms. The promulgation of this order was a matter of ten days ago, and the intention is obviously to create an ideal excuse so that it can stop trading with Germany when necessary. An exporter here said, "Recently, it has been rumored that the Soviet Union can supply Germany with a large amount of kerosene, which is exaggerated. Considering that the Soviet Union must import kerosene from the United States every year, it is known that its demand is far above its domestic production. According to statistics, the country imported 546,407 barrels of refined oil from the United States in 1936, which increased to 1,544,244 barrels in 1937, and the number was even more than this in 1938. Under this circumstance, how can Germany expect the Soviet Union to supply the country with kerosene for its long-term war?" As for Germany, according to another exporter, "Apart from exporting mediocre machines, there is really nothing that can be supplied to the Soviet Union. And as far as this machine is concerned, it is doubtful that Germany can manufacture it in large quantities during the period of foreign warfare. Moreover, the Soviet Union does not rely solely on Germany, and the United States also has machines shipped to the Soviet Union. Regarding this point, although German heavy industry has an advantage, that is, the country is closer to the Soviet Union, so it has some convenience in competition, but American machine exporters can supply the Soviet Union with products under more favorable conditions than Germany, which is at war, and it is easy to get started. For this reason, we firmly believe that the Soviet government will order a large number of machines from the United States this year, and the number ordered from Germany will definitely be very small. If the current economic agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union is still intact by March next year, then the Soviet Union should order industrial machinery worth about US$20 million from Germany. If Germany cannot deliver all the goods within a reasonable time limit, then the minimum amount stipulated in this agreement, that is, US$36 million, will inevitably not be reached." In addition, foreign merchants also believe that the main goods that the Soviet Union can supply to Germany are nothing more than timber and limited food. (Havas, 14th)

Tokyo, Nichinichi Shimbun - Now that the cabinet has accepted the demand of the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the unification of political and economic diplomacy, and has made concessions on the issue of the Ministry of Trade, it is now facing the difficult problems of (1) determining responsibility for this dispute, (2) restoring the dignity of the cabinet, and (3) correcting the discipline of officials.

If the United States can develop the trade potential of the Far East, the unemployment problem in the United States can be completely solved. According to Mr. Babson, when he was in the Far East, he conducted considerable research on the background of the Sino-Japanese War. (Associated Press, 14th)

### U.S. Senate Continues Debate on Neutrality Bill; Taft Supports Pittman's Proposal

Washington - The Senate met today to continue the debate on the Neutrality Act amendment. Republican Senator Taft (a potential Republican presidential candidate) delivered a speech criticizing the arms embargo, saying that it only benefits aggressor nations and is not conducive to peace-loving nations. "As far as I can see," he said, "the United States can avoid being drawn into the vortex of war even if it does not maintain the arms embargo. The Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Pittman, which prohibits American ships from carrying goods to belligerent countries, is particularly appropriate. However, I do not agree with one of its clauses, which advocates giving belligerent countries a 90-day credit loan when purchasing military equipment from the United States, and it should be repealed." Republican Senator Nye (leader of the isolationists) followed with a speech, strongly arguing that if the arms embargo were lifted, American industry might flourish during the war, but it would be dangerous for the future national economic structure. The United States would also be unable to help restore peace. (Havas, 13th)

Washington - Republican Senator Taft of Ohio yesterday strongly supported President Roosevelt's Neutrality Act amendment at a Senate meeting, calling for the repeal of the arms embargo clause in the current Neutrality Act. He called this clause "a discrimination against Britain, France, and other peace-loving countries, and we are morally obligated to correct it." Taft then proposed an amendment suggesting that the government declare the so-called war zone and prohibit American ships from sailing within 300 miles of the European coast. Taft also suggested cash transactions and restricting belligerent countries from purchasing with the U.S. Equalization Fund. Taft's proposed restrictions on ship navigation were immediately approved by a majority. Vice President Garner has been the most active in this regard. He believes that this will allow the debate to end and the vote to take place as soon as possible. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has agreed to study Garner's proposal and will issue an opinion next week. Isolationist Nye said, "A solid fortification cannot be built on this arena of large-scale slaughter." He said that if the United States abolishes the arms embargo clause in the current Neutrality Act, not only will the national economy be greatly affected, but the United States will also lose its position in the world peace movement. (Associated Press, 14th)

Washington - Famous aviator Charles Lindbergh delivered a radio speech today opposing the repeal of the arms embargo clause. He said, "If we repeal the arms embargo clause and help one side of the belligerent countries to defeat the other, then why talk about neutrality? Those who advocate the repeal of the arms embargo clause must know that this action is the first step to drawing the United States into the vortex of war. After this step is taken, the second step will be to expand loans, and then to send troops to help fight. Furthermore, the repeal of the arms embargo will not benefit democracy, because I firmly believe that the current war in Europe is not fought for democracy, but for the balance of power in Europe... If the German side tries to expand its military power, and the British and French fear this military power, and we then supply them with military equipment, the war will become longer and Europe will become more dilapidated. If Britain and France could have made concessions to Germany after the last European war, then the current war would not have occurred." (Associated Press, 14th)

Chongqing - Great attention is being paid here to Konoe's recent statement on his talks with Wang Jingwei, and the situation discussed by Hiranuma with Wang when he was prime minister, and the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China and the Japanese Command in Central China have also successively issued proclamations. Various circles in China here said that from these proclamations, it can be seen that Tokyo and the Japanese military authorities in China have different opinions on Japan's future policy in China. Many believe that the publication of Konoe's draft document is half intended to explore whether Japan is willing to negotiate peace conditions directly with Chongqing if it stops military operations. China is willing to negotiate. Many believe that the reason why Wang Jingwei has not immediately started to form a new government is also because of this. In the opinion of various circles in China, Konoe's proposal has been severely opposed by the Japanese military authorities in China. It is recalled that the headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Force once issued a proclamation stating that the Japanese army intends to strictly implement military operations in China, and a spokesman for the Japanese army in Central China also announced that the Japanese army will support Wang Jingwei's efforts to form a new government. The Central Daily News issued a critique of the current situation, saying that Japan has fallen into despair in China and does not know what to do. This fact has made its policies inconsistent, the cabinet has repeatedly changed, and has caused disputes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chinese observers believe that the Japanese know that they cannot conquer China by force, and cannot obtain a solution to the war. It is expected that there will be more changes in the cabinet in Tokyo, and opinions within the country will be even more conflicting. (Reuters, 14th)

### Ji Shiwen Fights Bravely Against the Enemy; National Government Awards Medal

Chongqing - The National Government issued an order on the 13th that Ji Shiwen be awarded the Ninth-Class Baoding Medal. Here is a record of Ji's deeds: Ji is a private in a certain unit of our army in Ji Province. On September 1st, in the battle of Wangzhuang in Neihuang, he was surrounded by the enemy. At that time, the soldier stood alone and fought bravely. Because he was too close to the enemy, his rifle failed, so he threw several hand grenades, killing two enemies. Then, he engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The soldier was already wounded in several places, but he still fought hard, one against ten. Then, with a loud roar, he jumped towards the enemy line and charged straight ahead, wielding his knife and killing three enemy soldiers in a row. Finally, because he used too much force, his knife stuck in the enemy's bone and he could not pull it back. He was taken away by an enemy soldier with a knife. The remaining enemies were frightened and retreated. The soldier took the opportunity to jump out of the enemy's position and safely returned to the camp. After the commander-in-chief reported the matter, he said that the soldier was brave in killing the enemy and fearless, and was worthy of praise, so he telegraphed to the authorities, requesting that he be commended.

### The Japanese Army Invades Shiqi: More Than a Thousand Traitors Secretly Act as Insiders

Hong Kong Correspondence: On the 1st of this month, the Chinese army once stormed into Shenzhen, resulting in fierce fighting. At the same time, the Japanese army once again invaded Zhongshan, and after ten days of fierce fighting, Shiqi, where the Zhongshan County government is located, was occupied by the Japanese army at 3:00 PM on the 7th of this month. The following is a record of the battle:

Zhongshan is a county near Guangzhou, bordering the Pearl River Estuary to the east and Portuguese-occupied Macau to the south. The rivers are crisscrossed like a spider web, and the products are abundant. Since the fall of Guangzhou, it has become a major transportation route between the inland areas of Guangdong Province and overseas. However, since Daliang and Jiangmen followed Guangzhou in falling into enemy hands, Zhongshan has been surrounded by the Japanese army in fact. At the beginning of last month, when the battle situation in Central China was unfolding, the Japanese side began to launch indiscriminate attacks on various places along the river in Zhongshan in order to contain the Chinese forces. By the end of last month, the Japanese army in Central China had made steady progress, thinking that Changsha could be taken at any moment. In fact, there was no need to contain the Chinese forces, so the battle situation in Zhongshan gradually subsided. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army suffered a major defeat in an ambush in northern Hunan. The Japanese side urgently dispatched two to three thousand reinforcements from the 5th and 6th of this month to invade Shiqi on a large scale in several routes with the combined forces of the army, navy, and air force. The Chinese defense teams immediately rose up and fought back separately. After two days of fierce fighting, both sides suffered heavy losses. Until the afternoon of the 7th, more than a thousand traitors suddenly sneaked into Shiqi City, set fires, and rioted. The Chinese army, suffering this blow, withdrew from Shiqi. Cuiheng Village, the hometown of Sun Yat-sen, was also reduced to ruins under the indiscriminate bombing of Japanese aircraft. It is heard that the only purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Zhongshan was to cover up their failure in Central China. In reality, they had no spare strength to penetrate into the inland areas of Guangdong Province, and they did not dare to risk attacking Xijiang to bring about their own destruction. However, with the fall of Zhongshan, Macau and Hong Kong are often significantly affected. The production of grain, fish, meat, and vegetables in Zhongshan County is exceptionally abundant. After Guangzhou, Hainan, and Chaoshan successively fell into enemy hands, Zhongshan has become the only source of grain and vegetables for Hong Kong and Macau. Now that this source is cut off, the food panic in Hong Kong and Macau will inevitably be even worse. (Note: The Japanese army that invaded Shiqi was repelled by the Chinese army on the 11th, and Shiqi was about to be recovered, which shows the fragility of the Japanese army. Although they gained Shiqi, they could not hold it.)

### The Tongruhai Guerrilla隊, Sun's Department Expands its Force

Zhang's Regiment has been reorganized into a Brigade

Nantong Correspondence: The guerrilla units in Tongzhou, Rugao, Hai'an, and Qidong counties in northern Jiangsu, last year ××× and others, once united various miscellaneous units, hoping to make changes. After the provincial government ordered the transfer of Sun's brigade commander of the ×th Brigade and Zhang's regiment commander to lead their troops to suppress and reorganize them on the spot, the brigade has expanded to eight or nine thousand people. The equipment is sophisticated, and the grain and ammunition are sufficient. They have repeatedly engaged in encounters with the Japanese army, killing many Japanese soldiers. After the provincial government reported to the commander of the ×th Military Region, he issued an order to commend them, and designated Tongzhou, Rugao, and Hai'an counties as defense areas, planning to recover the lost territory in northern Jiangsu. In addition to Zhang's regiment being reorganized into a brigade, it is also heard that Sun's brigade commander will be promoted to division commander.

### The Wuxi Puppet Government Attempts to Collect Land Tax

And intimidates villagers to protect the highway

Wuxi Correspondence: In the countryside of Xiyi, the early rice has already been harvested, and only the late rice needs a few more weeks to be cut. The puppet county government has already found a way to levy the "land tax." Because there are many guerrilla隊 in the rural areas, the villagers also refuse to come to the city to pay. The puppet government previously set up mobile "collection points" in Kaiyuan and Yangming townships, but they were also afraid of guerrilla隊 attacks and hid at any time. Recently, they sent puppet tax collectors carrying "a string of tickets" to Nanqiao, Nanfangquan, and other places to urge collection, and dozens of puppet police and Japanese soldiers went with them. They gathered under the Tongyun Bridge on the 12th, but the countryside had already heard the news and ignored them all. It is expected that there will be no results.

In the Xijing section of the Xihu Highway, from the Chajia Bridge section, there are eleven bridges of various sizes, all of which are believed to have been destroyed by the Chinese army. The Japanese puppets have been greatly affected. On the 7th of this month, the Japanese side ordered the puppet government to order the farmers along the highway to be responsible for protecting it. The Japanese army will repair the bridges. If the bridges are damaged again, the farmers in the section should raise funds to repair them. If they disobey, the river will be filled and the drinking water of the villages will be cut off. The villagers were not alarmed by this dangerous threat, because the Chinese army appears and disappears unpredictably, and it is impossible to bear this responsibility. The Japanese puppets also have no practical solution.

### Recent Situation in Various Parts of Pinghu

Haiyan's Restoration Awaits Jiaxing Correspondence: After a part of the Japanese army in Pinghu was transferred to support other areas, there are about twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers in the city. They keep the city walls tightly closed every day, and set up cannons on the city walls to fire indiscriminately.

County Magistrate Xu Minzhong was wounded in a fierce battle with the Japanese army between Zhapu and Xincang. He has now recovered from his injuries. Recently, he has concentrated the large and small mobile units in the southwest region, reorganized them, and equipped them with new-style military equipment, preparing to advance towards the county seat in the near future.

On the 11th, the Japanese army's Tamura unit in Y城 and Xitangqiao areas was intercepted by the Chinese army. The Japanese army was defeated, and the captain, Wangjiang, was seriously injured. Many military supplies were abandoned.

Haiyan City was recovered by the Chinese army long ago, but the houses were burned down, the commercial market was completely gone, the population was sparse, and it was impossible to restore it. Although a rehabilitation committee has been established, it is merely a formality.

### The Ministry of Education Handles the Situation of Unified Enrollment in the Current Session: More Than 19,000 People Apply for the Exam, and More Than 5,000 New Students are Admitted

(Chongqing Aviation News) The new students admitted by the unified enrollment of national universities and colleges this year have been distributed to the schools by the Ministry of Education and announced on August 23. According to news from the Unified Enrollment Committee, the unified enrollment this year was held simultaneously in 15 districts and 13 sub-offices across the country. A total of 21,338 students applied for the exam. Except for the Chenxi District Lantian Sub-office, because of postal delays, the scores of 1,000 examinees have not yet been sent. The scores of examinees from the remaining districts and offices have been sent to the Ministry, totaling 19,039 people. After the Ministry reviewed the scores, 5,085 new university students were admitted, accounting for 26% of the examinees, which is four to one. Graduates of secondary schools accounted for about 91% of the admitted students, and those with equivalent academic ability accounted for 8%. In addition to restricting one-tenth of the number of people with equivalent academic ability, they must also have scores that are in the first half of the number of people who can be admitted before they can be admitted. The group of admitted students, the first group of departments in the colleges of liberal arts, law, business, and the Chinese, English, civics, training, education, and physical education departments of the normal colleges admitted 1,783 people. The second group of departments in the colleges of science and engineering and the mathematics, physics, and chemistry departments of the normal colleges admitted 2,679 people. The third group of departments in the colleges of agriculture and medicine and the natural history department of the normal college admitted 623 people. The admitted students have now been assigned to 22 national colleges and universities, as well as Chongqing University of Sichuan Province and Henan Provincial University, a total of 24 units. The distribution standard is that the first step is to completely follow the examinee's first choice, according to the score, and give priority to the distribution. If the first choice is full and cannot be distributed, the second and third choices will be followed, and the examination area will be referred to for distribution. Examinees in this area have the priority to be distributed to schools in this area, followed by nearby areas, and then other areas. If all three choices of the examinee are full, they will be assigned to colleges and departments with similar characteristics in this area or nearby areas. In addition to the admitted new university students, those whose scores are not too far from the admission standard are admitted as university preparatory students, a total of 1,025 people, and distributed to various university preparatory classes for study. The general public often has two opposite views on the width and strictness of the unified enrollment admission standards. On the university side, every hope is that the standard will be raised and fewer places will be taken, while the society is afraid that the majority of students who are interested in further education will be unable to study and hope to admit them leniently. The Ministry of Education considers the scores of examinees, the needs of the country, and the capacity of the schools, and determines the admission standards. Judging from the ratio of the number of examinees to the number of admitted students being four to one, the standard cannot be said to be too low. In the past, each school conducted its own examinations, and students could apply for several schools at the same time. Therefore, the results of the admissions of each school were as high as ten to one. Now, because of the unified examination, students can only apply once, and the admission ratio cannot be so far away. As for the number of students who are not admitted, although there are often many, among them, nearly 5,000 people who apply for the examination with equivalent academic ability can still return to middle school to study. Those who have graduated from middle school can apply for military schools and schools related to military industrial technology to meet the urgent needs of the war of resistance. A part can apply for vocational schools and various specialized courses designated by the Ministry of Education. These specialized courses continue to enroll students, and young people can enter this type of school to learn corresponding skills to meet the needs of national construction. Those who must enter the university for further study, the number of people approved by the Ministry to be recruited by provincial and private colleges and universities this year is about 5,000, and each student also has the opportunity to try again. The remaining few students who cannot go to school can also find ways to find employment as intermediate-level cadres in the society, which is also the practical need of the country today.

### The Four-Corner Cross-Country Race: Held This Morning

Starting at Minzhi at 6:30 AM

The cross-country competition between Hongkou, Qingguang, Lian Da, and Youqiang, with a distance of four and a half miles, is scheduled to start at 6:30 AM this morning in front of the Minzhi Middle School on Qi Haiwei Road, rain or shine. Each team has ten participants. The scores are calculated based on the six who arrive first. Among the teams, Hongkou is the most雄厚 in strength. It will definitely be a blockbuster at that time, giving the teams a very heavy threat. Although Youqiang has heroes such as Gao Dingtai, its strength seems to be lacking in balance, but the fierce competition will definitely add a lot of color to this year's cross-country race. However, the heavy rain last night turned Fuxu Road and Da Xi Road into rivers, and it is still doubtful whether it can be held this morning. The route starts from Weihaiwei Road, passes Fuxu Road and Da Xi Road, turns left into Yidingpan Road, and goes east along Haige Road to turn into Fuxu Road and Weihaiwei Road to the finish line.

### Finance: US-British Exchange Rate Rises Again by Four Yuan. Speculation Leads to Selling British Gold and Buying US Exchange Rate. US Exchange Rate Closes at Seven Yuan and Five Jiao. HSBC Maintains British Gold But Then Returns Heavily. Continuous Low Discount Rates Lead to Tightening.

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday, HSBC's listing price, remained unchanged. The British-US exchange rate on the black market, due to the situation in Europe, after Britain and France rejected Mr. Xi's peace proposal, the world deeply believes that peace is hopeless, causing overseas pounds (belligerent countries) to plummet again. The morning price of three yuan, nine jiao, six fen, three li was as low as three yuan, nine jiao, four fen, five li, two, a huge drop of seven and a half fen. And speculative merchants in this city, and certain foreign banks with profit and foreign electrics, etc., all sold British gold, the momentum was turbulent. Fortunately, HSBC made every effort to maintain it, and the magnitude of the stomach could be described as rare. It is heard that it had absorbed more than 200,000 pounds from a certain two foreign banks. One call and a hundred responses caused other merchants to join in the buying, and the buying intention of Sassoon and the Tianjin gang also arose spontaneously, so the price was very tight. The closing US exchange rate was seven yuan and five jiao, and the British gold was also tightened to four pints, five, six, two, five. As for the future trend, it is the same as the spot, only heard of buying US exchange rate, but no British gold. The far-term (November) British-US exchange rate was three yuan, one jiao, two fen, seven li, two. The half-day transaction was smooth. Since the continuous low discount rates, the current筹码 is full. Those who could not speculate in the foreign exchange market due to the shortage of cash in the past can now resume their activities. Therefore, the public debt market transaction is clear (public debt transactions are all done with exchange), and the foreign exchange buying trend has risen again. The recent exchange rate tightening and the low discount rate are not without reason.

British Gold Buying Trend Turns Strong at Noon

In the early morning, the London big bar, near-term length is half a pint, and the far-term has no honor or disgrace. New York silver price soared by one point and one two five. London raw gold is stable, the exchange rate British vs. US, vs. Shanghai, vs. France are all flat, the US vs. British shrank by seven and a half points, vs. Shanghai fell by five points, and vs. France fell by a small three points eight seven five. The central listing price for each exchange rate is as before. The bank opened spot selling prices in the morning, British gold four pints six five six two five, US exchange rate seven yuan six eight seven five. Compared with the previous closing, the British gold loose zero three one two five, the US exchange rate is soft zero six two five, which is due to the contraction of the exchange rate. After the opening, although the US bank tried to sell British gold, and foreign electrics and speculative merchants also sold British gold, because HSBC's stomach was very strong, the market was slightly tight. It is estimated that HSBC ate into a certain foreign bank, foreign electrics, and speculative merchants' spot British gold four pints six five six two five and six two five (heard to be a large number). HSBC announced that the listing price would not move, and the silver balance tax announcement continued to be large two points seven five. After that, the speculative merchants, in view of the fact that HSBC's stomach was so strong, also stopped selling and turned to buying, coupled with the fact that Western merchants Sassoon and foreign firms and the Tianjin gang all rushed to settle, so the situation became tighter. It is estimated that Sassoon, Chinese merchants, the Tianjin gang, and foreign firms settled spot British gold four pints six two five and five six two five from foreign banks Datong Huabi Youli and a certain bank, and spot US exchange rate from seven yuan six two five to half a yuan. At the same time, speculators also bought this month's US exchange rate seven yuan five six two five and November's US exchange rate seven yuan four three seven five and three seven five from a certain bank Youli. It was already noon. The noon closing bank spot selling price British gold four pints five six two five, US exchange rate seven yuan half, this month's British gold four pints five three one two five, US exchange rate seven yuan four three seven five, November's British gold four pints four six eight seven five, US exchange rate seven yuan three one two five. As a result, compared to the previous day, the current British exchange rate is tighter zero six two five, the US exchange rate is softer two five. The swap spread continues to widen. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Hong Kong US Exchange Rate Spot Market Tightens Sharply

Exchange rates generally did not change. In the afternoon, the Shanghai exchange rate spot market rose by three yuan, to 321 yuan. The market was stable. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Tianjin British-US Exchange Rates Diverge

Tianjin, 14th Electric: Today's exchange market opened steadily in the morning. The spot British exchange rate was loose zero six two five, to four pence. The spot US exchange rate shrank zero six two five, to six yuan five six two five. The Shanghai exchange rate did not move, still at 117 yuan. The "United Note" black market rose slightly by half a yuan, to 86 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Weakens, Gold Market Continues to Prosper

Yesterday's cash gold market continued to rise due to the aftereffects of the previous day and the morning's weakening foreign exchange rates. However, the gains were limited. The opening price was raised to 4,020 yuan, but the momentum was slightly suppressed by the gold dealers. It once fell back to a low of 3,998 yuan. Subsequently, the securities firms suddenly bought on behalf of their clients, and the foreign exchange continued to weaken, causing bargain hunters to enter the market, pushing the high price of 4,028 yuan back before the close. The closing price was 4,023 yuan, a gain of 35 yuan compared to the previous day. It was rumored that after the close, the money exchange houses also bought on behalf of their clients. In the afternoon, the highest off-market price was seen at 4,045 yuan, but towards the end, the jewelers and retail investors sold off, bringing the price back to 4,020 yuan. According to the afternoon's foreign exchange settlement price, calculated at 4s 5.625d per pound sterling, it amounted to about 4,391 yuan (a premium of 370 yuan). Calculated at 7.5 yuan per US dollar, it amounted to about 4,670 yuan (a premium of 650 yuan). The premium was higher than the previous day, probably due to a certain gold dealer selling heavily. Trading was still brisk in the morning, with a volume of about 700 taels. Jewelry gold rose first and then fell, but ultimately remained unchanged. Customs gold remained flat.

Gold Exceeds 4,000 Yuan Mark

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially carried on the momentum of the previous day, coupled with the weakening of foreign exchange rates. The brokers' cries were very loud, and the sellers' asking prices were particularly high. The opening price was raised sharply by 32 yuan. The jewelers bought from the money exchange houses at 4,020 yuan per ten taels. After the opening, a certain gold dealer suddenly began to sell heavily, and the jewelers and retail investors also stopped buying and started selling. Shortly thereafter, the price fell back by a small 22 yuan. A certain gold dealer sold 30 taels to the money exchange houses at 3,998 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange continued to weaken, more buyers emerged, while sellers watched from the sidelines. At that time, the securities firms were actively pushing up the price, and it rose again by 30 yuan. The securities firms bought 20 taels from the money exchange houses at a price of 4,028 yuan. After this, a certain gold dealer resumed selling, and retail investors and cash gold dealers also took profits. Although a certain money exchange house bought on behalf of its clients, the position was still felt to be ample for a time. Before long, the price fell back by a small 13 yuan. Gold dealers traded 30 taels among themselves, and the money exchange houses bought 20 taels from the jewelers, both at a price of 4,015 yuan. At noon, the selling pressure eased slightly, and the upward momentum was revived, pushing the price up another 8 yuan. A certain money exchange house bought 40 taels from the gold dealers at 4,023 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, the price rose 35 yuan compared to the previous day. It was noted that it had risen for two consecutive days, for a total increase of 83 yuan. It was rumored that after the close, a certain money exchange house became more eager to buy, and raised the price by more than 10 yuan. A certain money exchange house bought 10 taels from a peer at a price of 4,040 yuan. In the afternoon, Saturday was a holiday for settlement, and it was reported that there was still some trading off-market, with the highest price being 4,045 yuan. A certain gold dealer and money exchange house sold off, and the price ultimately fell back to 4,020 yuan. The cash gold dealers' own gold was sold at a premium of 4 or 5 yuan over the cash gold price, and the buying price was about 30 yuan lower than the selling price. The current margin gold was bought and sold at about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but no transactions were reported.

Jewelry Gold Rises First, Then Falls Back

At first, the jewelers' jewelry gold was quoted at 405 yuan per tael, the same as the Da Tong Hang. Then, at 1:52 PM, it was raised by 5 yuan. Later, at 4:05 PM, it fell back by a small 5 yuan, and ultimately there was no change. The Da Tong Hang still quoted the original price of 405 yuan. The Xin Tong Hang quoted the same price. The buying price was about 20 yuan lower.

### Securities: Rumors of Peace Again, Government Bonds Rise Again, Foreign Stocks Actively Traded

Yesterday's securities market initially continued to fall, but rumors re-emerged in the afternoon, and the upward momentum resumed. After the noon close, there were rumors of a Sino-Japanese ceasefire. Although known to be baseless, the market was stimulated after two consecutive days of declines, and there was also a shift in types. Most of the transactions involved selling Class C shares and buying other types. Furthermore, large investors gradually absorbed shares, showing signs of regrouping. If the atmosphere of peace becomes more pronounced, there may be a second wave of price increases in the future. Yesterday's trading volume was relatively lower due to Saturday. Buyers, adhering to the principle of the 20th, continued to absorb shares. Da Feng and Song Mao also showed strong buying interest, but Tian Sheng and Yong Kang continued to be sold off in large quantities. Hong Da Tong Kang also tended to sell. Therefore, the noon close was still down by a small 3 or 4 jiao. After the close, rumors suddenly emerged, and sentiment changed abruptly, so afternoon trading was also more active. The exchange of Da Qing and Da Sheng shares was quite lively, and there was a particularly high demand for Class B shares. Lian Yi and Xie Da bought in, and retail investors actively covered their short positions. The selling pressure was relatively weak. Class C and E shares broke through the 7 yuan mark again, and Class B shares even reached 9 yuan. The market once again showed signs of being easy to rise and difficult to fall. In terms of market prices, except for Class D shares, which were not traded in the afternoon, they were down by a small 4 jiao. The rest had rebounded by 3 or 4 jiao to 9 jiao. The total number of transactions was about 60 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

In the stock market, 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 40 yuan and 2.5 jiao, which was said to be firmer than before. Yesterday's market at the Public Association was lively. Rui Rong shares rose sharply to 14 yuan, which was particularly noteworthy. Other stocks did not change much. The general public's interest has now spread to the entire market. The trading volume of rubber stocks was also considerable.

Next Monday's settlement will be very large. For the sake of specialization, the market will suspend morning trading at that time, and resume the normal afternoon session at 2:30 PM.

London, 13th - Today's London Stock Exchange prices for Far East companies' stocks: Gulangyu Rubber shares fell 2 pence to 15 shillings and 7 pence. The rest were flat.

London, 13th - Today's London Stock Exchange prices for Chinese foreign debt: The trend was stable. There were no changes in any of the bond prices.

### Foreign Currency Buying Interest Resurges

Yesterday's foreign currency market continued to advance. Initially, HSBC had an appetite for buying British and American exchange, and Tianjin banks and Sassoon also scrambled to buy, leading to a potentially weak market. After the Hong Kong banks actively purchased gold, it also broke through the 4,000 yuan mark again. All of this was enough to boost buying interest, so US dollar notes initially rose to 13.23 yuan, and then rose further to 5.25 jiao. Other currencies also rose sharply. In the afternoon, the market suddenly heard news from the Tongmenghui that the British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr had met with Foreign Minister Wang before flying to Rong. The agency believed that the British ambassador was once again mediating the Sino-Japanese War, which led to the sudden disappearance of buying interest, and the market turned slightly weaker. US dollar notes ultimately ended at 13.42 yuan, a high increase of 3.2 jiao. British pounds also rose 5 jiao, gold notes rose 7 jiao, US dollars rose 1 yuan, French franc notes rose 5 li, Singapore notes rose 1.5 jiao, Canadian notes rose 3 jiao, and Japanese gold notes also tended to be firm, ultimately ending at 1.36 yuan, up 1.2 li compared to the previous day. Korean notes were very stable, with the price still standing at 1.157 yuan. Everything else was unchanged.

### Yarn, Yarn Market Lingers, Large Investors Continue to Sell, Actual Sales Rely Only on Coarse Yarn

The yarn market saw a slight increase, but the trend remained weak. In general, it did not break free of the lingering state. People were mostly optimistic, but actual sales were slow and uninspired. Hong Kong buyers purchased mostly 10s and 12s coarse yarn, but the amount was minimal. Mainland buyers also bought coarse yarn, but other buyers made no moves. Judging from the overall situation, the market is unlikely to see a new look unless customer sales develop. According to market reports, a certain large investor continued to sell, but the quantity was not as large as in the past, probably preparing to change course. Another theory is that there is too much stockpiled goods, and temporarily selling it off would reduce some risk.

Due to the heavy rain in the morning, the streets were flooded, and traffic was inconvenient, so attendees arrived late. The market did not open until 10:00 AM. 20s Shuangma yarn was priced at 720 yuan, up 5 yuan. Shortly thereafter, peers bought and raised the price by another 4 yuan, but actual demand was still sluggish, and the price fell again. There was not much change in the middle, and it was generally sluggish and listless. It was found that the half-day trading volume was 910 bales, compared to 225 bales on the previous day. 20s Shuangma yarn rose 6 yuan, and the rest was similar to the previous day. Today, 50 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each buyer is listed below:

Hong Kong: 140 bales
Peers: 600 bales
Mainland: 140 bales
Ningbo: 30 bales
Total: 910 bales

### Cotton Trading, Chinese Factories Halt

Cotton trading remained quiet. Chinese factories halted purchases, and Japanese factories' needs were even more scattered. Shanghai factories traded slightly, buying 400 bales of Changyinsha packed cotton, but there were no other major moves. Sales of Tongzhou cotton were particularly slow, but prices remained stable, about the same as the previous day. Sources from Northern Jiangsu: Tongzhou cotton 1,590 bales, North Sha cotton 2,160 bales. Exports today included 665 bales shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is listed on the left:

Tongzhou: 134.00 yuan, Peers: 100 bales
Changyin Packed: 141.50 yuan, Shanghai: 400 bales
Pingguoer: 121.00 yuan, Hongzhang: 200 bales

Another report: Yesterday's foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was tighter in exchange rates, and cotton prices rose by 3 to 5 yuan per picul. Traders' sentiment therefore became firmer. However, the factory's purchase of raw cotton was still extremely weak. Traders yesterday ordered 500 bales of American cotton for spinning 20s yarn in December, and the price was very cheap. According to current exchange rates, it is only about 170 yuan.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: New York cotton market was initially dull due to the enthusiastic purchases of traders. Later, due to the short selling of Southern traders, the market became fatigued. As a result, closing prices, except for the near term, were unchanged. Long-term contracts fell 2 to 3 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market was very firm, rising 5 rupees or more yesterday, including forecasts. Egyptian cotton fell more than 10 pounds. Liverpool rose 4 pence.

### Grains: Autumn Rain Turns into a Wetland, Rice Prices Firm

The autumn rain was torrential, the river tide was high, and Shanghai was almost entirely a wetland. Therefore, there were few rice buyers. No goods arrived from the river, and only 4,000+ packages were shipped by wheels, so although trading was sparse, the buyers' sentiments were quite firm. Broken glutinous rice, new japonica rice, 100-grain rice, and sheep-reed rice prices all held the original board. Due to yesterday's price hike, the market for sharp rice was sluggish and showed a softening trend, with some falling by 2-3 jiao. The total trading volume in the general market was only 3-4,000 packages. Changshu and Wuxi broken japonica rice markets had no high-quality goods, only the middle market traded at 30 yuan, and the secondary market at 27-28 yuan. Suzhou and Kunshan high-quality broken rice traded at 30 yuan, 29 yuan, and secondary at 27 yuan, new japonica at 27.7 yuan to 26.7 yuan. Zhuanqiao old broken new japonica traded at 23 yuan. Greenhorn Kiln seed traded at 29 yuan. White paddy traded at 28-29 yuan. Fengjia 100-grain special traded at 28 yuan, market at 27.5 yuan, 27 yuan, medium at 26.5 yuan. Sheep sharp special traded at 23.2 yuan, secondary to 21 yuan. Reed sharp special traded at 23.5 yuan, secondary to 22 yuan. Jiangbei sharp traded at 18.8 yuan to 18.5 jiao. Wuhu sharp special traded at 19.3 yuan, secondary to 18 yuan. Chongji sharp traded at 17.5 yuan, sharp traded at 17 yuan. Nanjing special sharp traded at 19.6 jiao, secondary to 18.5 jiao. Bianyuan old traded at 31-32 yuan, 30 yuan, new at 16.5 yuan to 26 yuan.

Yesterday, in the heavy wind and rain, trading in sharp japonica rice was sluggish. Actual buyers were deeply concerned that the shipping would be affected by moisture and stopped operating. Transient hoarding was also looking on. Flood-affected goods that had been immersed in water in the godowns were all eager to lower prices to avoid late sales. The quality of the new rice was relatively poor, and although the bags had been changed, it was still difficult to store for long. Very few buyers arrived in both the upper and lower markets. Supply exceeded demand, and market prices immediately fell. High-quality rice fell by a small 2-3 jiao, and medium to poor quality flood-affected rice fell by a small 3-4 jiao to 6-7 jiao. Fewer than 2,000 packages were traded, with nearly 4,000 stones still arriving.

### Reprocessed Flour Prices Exceed Factory Prices, Green Artillery Car 7.15 Yuan

Flour: Since customer sales have been active, although Northern and Southern merchants have not moved large quantities, retail sales have not declined. The number of godown receipts in the market is decreasing, and the wheat market has also shown an upward trend. Sentiments are uniformly firm, but trading is not lively due to the weekend. Factories are also unwilling to supply large quantities. It is heard that the price of Green Artillery Car flour has exceeded the factory price and reached 7.15 yuan. Red and Blue Car and Red and Blue Fuxin brands are only available for small-batch retail in the local market, and the factory price is still 7 yuan. It is also heard that the Japanese Phoenix brand is expected to rise sharply, with the price rising from 6.6 jiao to over 6.8 yuan. Today, 10,300 packages of flour were exported to Tianjin.

Wheat: Recently, production prices have been high, merchants have decreased, and the supply of foreign wheat has been difficult to plan. Sellers' psychology is quite firm and they are stubbornly holding on. However, factories are choosing carefully and buying selectively, and hoarders are also not urgently demanding it, so the market is becoming more rigid. As a result, no formal transaction was concluded.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Beans and Sesame Weaken, Vegetable Oil Arrivals Still Many

In the past two days, the sesame and soybean markets have both been declining, because goods are arriving from all routes, and most of them are of medium to poor quality. Currently, the various sellers are taking a "take high profits or kill" approach, because interest in buying is still not enthusiastic due to the lack of high-quality goods. Yesterday, sesame trading was more lively than other goods. A total of 700 packages of Yangzhou sesame were traded, with prices ranging from 26.3 yuan to 28.05 yuan. 300 packages of Hankou sesame were traded at a price of 31 yuan. More than 190 packages of Nanjing sesame were traded at a price of 31 yuan and 30.08 yuan. 30 packages of Wuhu sesame were traded at a price of 30 yuan. Only 100 packages of Taicang soybeans were traded at a price of 13 yuan and 12.9 jiao, and 200 packages of Wuhu soybeans were traded at a price of 13.1 jiao to 12.5 jiao.

Yesterday, 2,640 pieces and 6,300 cans of vegetable oil were shipped from Tianjin. Today, 1,100 cans and 150 pieces were exported to Hong Kong. Today, 300 packages of soybeans and 300 packages of sesame were shipped to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: White Sugar Continues to Rise

According to a Dutch telegram, the production price of sugar has risen again. The price of immediate shipment of coarse white sugar has risen to 9.80 Dutch guilders, so the Public Association's planning board has once again raised prices, ranging from 1 yuan to several jiao. The current price of 24 coarse white sugar in a local godown is 51.5 yuan, for 200 packages, 52.5 yuan in a foreign godown, for 300 packages, and 52.3 yuan, for 400 packages. Transshipment goods cost 40.55 yuan to 40.7 yuan. Taikoo CX white sugar costs 56.3 yuan for B mark in East godown, 56.7 yuan for West godown, CW mark 56.2 yuan, CX mark 55.7 yuan, DY mark 55.2 yuan, and HX mark 54.7 yuan. The H mark car red sugar costs 39 yuan to 39.5 yuan, and Dutch red has reappeared at the 40 yuan mark, costing 40.5 yuan to 41 yuan. The local Mian white Zhen Ji No. 1 costs 52.5 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are tax-refunded. Local rock sugar has increased by 1 yuan and a half, with No. 1 costing 64 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar costs 65.5 yuan. It is heard that there has been some off-market trading of Green red sugar for the local sugar, and the price is cheaper, but the details are not known.

### Market Conditions Summary

Fresh Jinan peach meat has recently been in short supply, and the market is very popular. Market stock is extremely scarce, so the higher prices are called at 140 yuan, and the second-best at 130 yuan, which is 20-30 yuan higher than the initial market opening price.

The discount rate for exchange drafts initially rose high and then returned to flat yesterday. The initial rate was 60 yuan per thousand yuan, once rising to 65 yuan at noon, and still the original rate in the afternoon, 7.5 yuan higher than the previous day. The interest rate of the Money Industry Association did not change, and both the morning and afternoon markets hung at 1.9 jiao.

### Occupying the Shanghai West Construction Factory, Counterfeit Allied Forces Establish Headquarters, Posting Absurd Notices and Slogans Everywhere, Innocent Passersby Suffer Torture for Inquiring

After a certain faction organized the so-called "Special Task Force" in the extraterritorial road area, it occupied No. 66 Caojiazhai the day before yesterday, organized the so-called "Peace Allied Forces," and posted slogans in the Shanghai West area to promote a certain faction. Yesterday morning, they suddenly occupied the Guiji Construction Factory at No. 250 Bailinan Road (at the intersection of Yidingpan Road) and established a "Military Headquarters," hanging a wooden sign at the entrance with the words "Headquarters of Changying Troops of the Peace Allied Forces." They also posted "Notices" on key roads nearby, the content of which was all absurd arguments in support of a certain faction. The previously occupied houses have been converted into the "Training Center" of the army. Both places are guarded by armed personnel. The "uniforms" worn by these people are similar to those of the "Special Task Force," also green, but the color is darker. The military caps they wear are round, similar to those used by the Japanese army, with cloth leggings and yellow rubber shoes. The attire is slightly neater than that of the "Special Task Force." It is said that the day before yesterday, a middle-aged man surnamed Qian was passing by the gate of a certain team department on Jessfield Road. Out of curiosity, he stood and looked inside. A sentry saw him and, without asking why, dragged him into the house. A civil defense notice was found in his felt hat. They made a big fuss, falsely accusing him of being a spy, and began to interrogate him. Despite being severely tortured, he did not confess anything. He only claimed that his hat was too big, so he used the paper to pad it and had no other intentions. Later, Mr. Qian's relatives heard the news and hired someone to intercede. They paid 150 yuan in legal tender before he was released.

### Heavy Rain Poured Down Yesterday Morning, Shanghai Suffered Unprecedented Flooding, Total Rainfall Was 3.82 Inches, Coinciding with High Tide and Unfavorable Wind Direction, Ditch Water Backed Up and Roads Became Wetlands

Heavy rain poured down in the city yesterday morning. It coincided with high tide and a strong southeasterly wind. Seawater surged into the Huangpu River, ditch water backed up, and the roads were flooded everywhere. The water was so deep that boats could be rowed. The extent of the flooding was even greater than the previous time when a hurricane struck Shanghai and caused a sudden high tide. It can be said that it was an unprecedented flood in Shanghai in recent times. According to a senior official of Shanghai Telephone Company, a telephone line was damaged, and 200 telephone subscribers in the area bounded by Suzhou Road in the south, Ningbo Road in the north, Yuemingyuan Road in the west, and Jiangxi Road in the east could not enjoy telephone service. However, the company has rushed to repair it, and it is expected that it will be fully restored today. Yesterday afternoon, the weather turned sunny and the climate was abnormally hot. Due to the high tide, the accumulated water on the roads had not completely receded by night. The details are as follows:

Torrential Rain is Rare

The rain yesterday morning started at 11:15 PM the day before yesterday. The intensity of the rain between 6:15 AM and 7:45 AM yesterday morning was rare. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the rainfall during this time was 85 mm.

After 8:00 AM, the Rain Slowed Down

The rain slowed down slightly from 8:00 AM, and the raindrops stopped slightly at 9:00 AM. In total, the rainfall from the start of the rain the day before yesterday at 11:00 PM to 9:00 AM yesterday was 96.6 mm, equivalent to 3.81 inches. The sudden intensity of the rainfall can be seen.

Total Rainfall Yesterday

From 9:30 AM yesterday, the raindrops continued to fall, but the intensity was sparse. It stopped at about 11:00 AM. The continued rainfall was 0.5 mm. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the total rainfall yesterday was 97.1 mm, equivalent to 3.82 inches.

Roads Everywhere, a Vast Ocean

Due to the torrential rain and the inability of the drainage ditches to discharge the water in time, the roads were flooded everywhere, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, Yinghua Street, Baike Road, Aiwanyi Road, Gansu Road, Wuding Road, Fuxu Road, Sapo Sai Road, Jessfield Road, Yuyuan Road, Dumei Road, and Xifei Road, all of which were a vast ocean. The water was so deep in places that it could reach the knees.

Huangpu River High Tide, Adding Insult to Injury

It was found that the Huangpu River had a high tide at 0:15 AM yesterday, and the quantity was between 2.5 and 2.5 inches close to the Bund embankment. When the rain was heaviest yesterday morning, the tide had not yet receded, so the water level of the Huangpu River was almost at the same level as the bank. The sewers of the road began to spew water, and the water on the ground began to flood.

Vehicular Traffic is Obstructed

There were few pedestrians on the road in the heavy rain yesterday morning, and the stores were deserted. In terms of traffic, due to the flooding of the roads, buses and trams were slowed down and driven through the water. Some were stalled due to the depth of the water. The Xifei Road tram tracks had not been running yesterday afternoon. Private cars and rickshaws circled in the water, as if they were punting in the heart of the waves, a spectacular sight. Pedestrians on the roads had to rely on vehicles all day long. Even if there was only a short distance between them, they had to use rickshaws to ferry them across. Most of the cars had their fuel tanks flooded and broke down along the way. Civilians waded through the water barefoot, and everyone lamented while walking.

Weather Cleared Up, Accumulated Water Not Exhausted

From yesterday afternoon, the sun shone and the weather cleared up, but the accumulated water on the roads had not completely receded by night. The reason is that the Huangpu River continued to have a high tide at 1:02 PM yesterday, and the quantity still reached 12 feet. The tide water flowed back from the sewers, so there was no way for the water on the ground to be discharged. It was found that the Huangpu River still has a high tide today, so it is difficult to expect the accumulated water on the low-lying roads to recede. Also, the weather was hot and humid after the rain yesterday, the highest temperature was 85.5 degrees, and the atmospheric pressure was low, so the weather is likely to change.

Tram Service Suspended, Traffic Mostly Interrupted

After 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the trams and buses on each route routinely left the factory for business. Due to the heavy rain, many factories were flooded. The water depth in front of the Xianshi Company in the Public Concession and the Shanzhong Road area in the French Concession was still several feet. The accumulated water was the deepest on Carter Road and Sapo Sai Road, so all trams on routes 1 and 2 were suspended. Only a few trams on other routes were not suspended, but five or six out of ten of them were running in the water.

Sleeping Soundly in Water, Rescue Too Late

Zhang Jinchao, a 23-year-old Jiangyin native, was working as a handyman at the Tongrong Iron Factory on Dunxin Road in Shanghai West. Zhang worked the night shift at the factory the night before. After finishing work, he slept on the floor of the factory. Yesterday morning, heavy rain poured down, and the factory was also flooded, becoming a wetland. Zhang Jinchao was too tired from working and slept soundly, immersed in the water. Yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, another worker caught a glimpse of him, called him but received no response, so he went forward and helped him up. He was already unconscious and barely breathing. He hired a car to take him to the Red Cross Hospital, but he died before reaching the hospital. The U.S. Consul Will Host a Banquet

### U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines Will Pass Through Shanghai Today

The U.S. Consul Will Host a Banquet

According to the Continental Daily News, Mr. Saya, the new U.S. Commissioner to the Philippine Islands, is traveling to Manila to take office on the President Cleveland. He will pass through Shanghai on Sunday. Mr. Gauss, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, will hold an informal banquet at the Columbia Country Club on the same day from 5:00 to 6:00 PM to entertain Mr. Saya. It has been announced that Mr. Saya's stay in Shanghai will be limited to residing on the ship, so the U.S. expatriates do not intend to officially entertain him. According to the U.S. Consulate, the consulate does not issue invitations individually, but invites general U.S. expatriates by announcing it in the newspaper. Mr. Saya was originally an assistant to the Secretary of State. Mr. McNutt, the former Commissioner to the Philippines, had previously returned to Washington to resign, and Mr. Saya was appointed to succeed him.

### New Annerley Steamer Trial Voyage to Xinghua, Not Allowed to Enter Port

The Company Declares a Temporary Rerouting

It is learned that the new Annerley steamer has arrived in Xinghua and is anchored outside the Sanjiang Estuary, but has not been allowed to enter the port. It is unknown whether it was blocked by Japanese warships. According to Taichangxiang Company, the ship has temporarily suspended its voyage to Fujian and rerouted to another line. However, it did not disclose where it was going.

### Absolutely Domestically Sold Tea, No Need to Settle Foreign Exchange When Transported to Shanghai

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously stated that tea, whether for domestic sale or transported to Shanghai, must be purchased with foreign exchange, and telegraphed the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance to explain. The Trade Commission replied by telegram that the matter of tea exports from various provinces this year should be handled by the local offices of the Chamber, together with the provincial government and the China Tea Company, to carefully identify and approve tea that is absolutely for domestic sale. The Chamber will issue a certificate, and the China Tea Company will declare it for export. Therefore, in the future, for tea that is absolutely for domestic sale, if transported to Shanghai, it must be handled in accordance with the above procedures, so there is no need to settle foreign exchange. It is hoped that this will be checked and handled accordingly.

### Police Department Superintendent Retires After Completion of Term

Mr. Laur, superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, has been in office for 25 and a half years. He will retire today after completing his term and leave Shanghai for Australia via England. Mr. Bowen, the Inspector General of the Police Department, and other Western senior detectives held a banquet at the Police Department Club on Fuzhou Road on the afternoon of the 13th to bid farewell to Mr. Laur, as a sign of remembrance. During the banquet, Inspector General Bowen presented Mr. and Mrs. Laur with wooden combs, silver horses, silver toys, etc. as souvenirs. It is said that Mr. Laur made many contributions to the Police Department during his 25 years in office and has received many awards.

### West Shanghai Puppet Police Plan to Take Over Traffic Lights; Large Numbers of Chinese and Foreign Police Rushed to the Scene; Puppet Police Retreat Upon Seeing the Situation Was Not Favorable

The "North-China Daily News" reported that police from the "Special Municipal Government Police Bureau" forcibly ordered Indian police from the Public Concession Police Department to close traffic lights at an important intersection on Yih Ting Pan Road West at 10:40 AM yesterday (the 13th), causing temporary chaos and nearly leading to incidents at the two intersections. The Jing'an Temple Police Station dispatched additional police officers to the two locations, and the "Special Municipal Police Bureau" eventually withdrew the police officers who had caused the dispute, and the matter subsided. The details are as follows:

Forcibly Ordering Indian Police to Close Traffic Lights

The Jiangwan authorities attempted to seize complete control of traffic management in the Yih Ting Pan Road area within the British defense zone. Without prior warning, they dispatched police officers carrying rifles in formation to the two intersections on Yih Ting Pan Road, forcibly ordering the on-duty Indian police officers to close the traffic lights. The Indian police officers were forced to comply. As soon as they were able to leave their posts, they immediately reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station using the police department's street telephone.

Chinese and Foreign Police Rush to Suppress

The police station immediately dispatched teams of Chinese and foreign police officers. It was estimated that the traffic lights at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Yih Ting Pan Road were stopped for three minutes, and the traffic lights at the intersection of Da Xi Road and Yih Ting Pan Road were stopped for ten minutes. However, after the police department dispatched 20 additional police officers to each of the two intersections, the "Special Municipal Government" police immediately yielded, and the police department officers resumed using traffic lights to direct traffic.

Jiangwan Police Also Withdraw

Approximately one hour later, the additional police officers dispatched by Jiangwan (one of whom was carrying a hand-held machine gun and stationed at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Yih Ting Pan Road) all withdrew from the two intersections. Shortly thereafter, the police department also recalled the reinforcements. At the same time, senior police officers from the police department arrived at the scene to inspect the two intersections and the intersection of Yih Ting Pan Road and Dun Xin Road, where the number of "Municipal Government" police had increased. Assistant Superintendent Kirk and Sampson, as well as several other senior police officers, also arrived at the scene.

British Military Commander Personally Inspects

Major General Simmons, the commander of the British garrison in Shanghai, and Major Ashmore also personally went to the scene of the incident to inspect. Shortly after the incident, "Special Municipal Government" personnel in military uniforms and carrying rifles patrolled the area in several trucks, stopping at various important intersections, but they did not get out of the vehicles when they arrived at the intersections on Yih Ting Pan Road.

Yesterday's Heavy Rain; Puppet Police Embarrassed

The puppet police had previously attempted to seize traffic control rights at the intersection of Yih Ting Pan Road and Yu Yuan Road and the intersection of Yih Ting Pan Road and Da Xi Road. Although the positions at both locations were flooded yesterday, the police station still dispatched additional detectives to guard the areas separately as a precaution. At the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Di Feng Road, the water was knee-deep. The puppet police stationed there were soaked by the rain and stood barefoot on the window bars beside the shop doors, looking quite embarrassed.

### Branches of the Bank of Communications Expected to Resume Operations Tomorrow; Will Continue to Pay Out at Original Locations; Japanese Occupy Third and Fourth Floors and Have Not Withdrawn

The inland retreat branches of the Bank of Communications, after the former site of the Bank of Communications headquarters at 10 Hankou Road was forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, entered the premises yesterday to reorganize and hold meetings with branch managers to prepare for the resumption of payments. In addition, they telegraphed the headquarters to report and request instructions on how to proceed and announced a postponement of the recruitment examination for probationary staff. The details are as follows:

Staff Enter to Reorganize Everything

The retreat branches operating at the former site of the Bank of Communications headquarters include: (1) the Provisional Liaison Office for branches in the Zhejiang area, including branches in the occupied areas of Zhejiang, such as Hangzhou, Wuxing, and Jiaxing; (2) the Provisional Liaison Office for branches in the Shanghai area, including branches along the Jinghu Road and Jinpu Road lines, such as Zhenjiang and Xuzhou; (3) the Provisional Liaison Office for branches in the Zhen area, including branches in the Jiangbei area, such as Taixing and Nantong. The establishment of the Provisional Liaison Office at 73 was intended to temporarily handle deposits from people in the occupied areas at various locations. After being forced to suspend operations starting the day before yesterday, the staff of the retreat branches entered the premises yesterday morning to reorganize everything and prepare for the resumption of payments.

Telegraphing the Headquarters to Request Instructions

In addition to telegraphed the headquarters the night before last to report the details of what happened and request instructions on how to proceed, the Shanghai branch of the bank convened an informal meeting of branch managers yesterday afternoon to discuss the aftermath. In order to facilitate payments to depositors in various locations, they plan to resume payments at the retreat branches starting on Monday, October 16. However, whether to do so at the original site or find another location for a temporary office depends on instructions to be telegraphed from headquarters. According to the "Newspaper Society" reporter's inquiries at the bank yesterday, the retreat branches, in light of the fact that the original site was forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese but the situation was not serious, plan to resume payments at the original site starting tomorrow.

Japanese Occupy and Have Not Withdrawn

The doormen and patrolmen at the former headquarters on Hankou Road near the Bund resumed their duties as usual yesterday morning. All staff members enter and exit through the back door on Hankou Road. However, personnel from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters are still occupying the third and fourth floors of the building, reportedly for use as dormitories for the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. As of last night, the occupation had not ended, and the Japanese had not withdrawn. However, the Japanese enter and exit through the main gate at 10 Hankou Road. Inside the gate is a post manned by plainclothes Japanese personnel. The gate, which had been tightly closed for a long time after the war, was forcibly opened by plainclothes Japanese personnel starting the day before yesterday. However, the Japanese do not interfere with the activities of the staff members on the second floor and lower levels.

Recruitment Examination for Staff Postponed

After the Bank of Communications staff training class was forced to suspend classes, the bank announced a postponement of the recruitment examination for probationary staff. A notice issued yesterday stated: "The bank originally scheduled the examination for October 15 and had notified applicants separately at the time of registration. Due to procedural reasons, we are unable to proceed as scheduled. We will announce the date and location at a later time. This is hereby notified." It is also understood that the examination questions and all relevant documents for the recruitment examination for probationary staff could not be taken out in advance. The bank is currently in negotiations to ensure that the examination can continue to be held.

Negotiations Are Still Underway

The "Newspaper Society" reporter learned from sources yesterday that the police department had negotiated with the Japanese regarding the Japanese Military Police Headquarters' forcible occupation of the former site of the Bank of Communications headquarters. The negotiations are still underway. The Bank of Communications is awaiting the outcome of the negotiations by the concession authorities. As of last night, there was no news of a resolution. However, the Bank of Communications hopes that the Japanese will withdraw, as there is no spare room available for rent in the building, so that the staff training class will not be forced to suspend classes and the recruitment examination for probationary staff can be held as usual. In addition, the documents and equipment for the training class are still on the third and fourth floors and have not yet been moved out.

Municipal Council Scheduled to Discuss Next Week

As of yesterday, the Municipal Council had not taken any action regarding this matter. However, Mr. Philippe, the General Manager and President of the Municipal Council, told reporters that the council intends to decide what steps to take regarding the seizure of the Bank of Communications building by the Japanese Military Police on the 13th within the next week. It is believed that the Municipal Council will decide on the attitude to be taken towards this illegal action at the regular board meeting to be held next Wednesday (the 18th) afternoon.

Japanese resident Waki Mototakuichi has accepted an invitation from the Municipal Council to serve as a member of the council's Sanitation Committee.

### Foreign Postal Ships to Arrive Today and Tomorrow

Sailing Schedules of Ships from Allied Nations Difficult to Ascertain

Due to the impact of the European War, the sailing schedules of postal ships from various countries are uncertain. Ships from the Allied nations maintain strict secrecy, so external knowledge of sailing schedules is completely lacking. The latest developments are summarized below:

American President Lines

"President Cleveland"

The "President" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 11th of this month, but due to a delay in departure from Los Angeles, it will now arrive at 1:15 PM today, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. The passenger tender "Mary Mahler" departed from the Customs Wharf at 1:15 PM today and returned with passengers to the Customs Wharf at 3:00 PM. The ship is scheduled to weigh anchor and depart for Hong Kong at 10:00 AM tomorrow. The final tender "Little Luzon" will depart from the Customs Wharf at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning.

Chang Hing Company

"Empress of Russia"

The ship came to Shanghai from Vancouver earlier this month and went to Hong Kong. "Little Luzon" has now returned from "Little Luzon" and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 3:30 PM this afternoon, berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will transfer to a tender and arrive at the Customs Wharf at approximately 4:30 PM. The ship is scheduled to depart for Japan tomorrow and return to Vancouver. The final passenger tender is scheduled to depart from the Customs Wharf at 7:30 AM this morning. The ship's departure time cannot be announced due to special circumstances. Passengers on the ship will be notified directly by the company.

French Postal Ship Company

"Félix Roussel"

The postal ship came to Shanghai from Europe on the 5th of this month and went to Japan on the 7th. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Japan today, arriving at 7:30 AM this morning, berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. It will stay in Shanghai for one day and night and depart from Shanghai at 7:30 AM tomorrow morning, returning to Marseille.

British Company Eurasia Line Regular

Postal Ship "Poet"

The arrival date of the ship, coming to Shanghai from England, has been repeatedly delayed. It has now been delayed from the 13th to 7:30 AM tomorrow (the 16th), and it is expected that there will be no further delays. The ship will berth at the Qichang Pier in Pudong and will depart for Japan and the northern ports next Wednesday.

Italian Postal Ship Company

"Victoria"

The ship, coming from Genoa to the Far East, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 16th), berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. The company has not yet received a telegram from the ship confirming the arrival time. There should be news today. There are very few passengers and cargo on this trip, and there are no Jewish passengers at all. It will depart for Europe at 11:00 AM on the 19th. The final passenger tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 9:00 AM on the 19th.

### Iron Netting Added at the End of North Jiangxi Road

To the east of the barbed wire fence erected by the Japanese army at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazi Road, there was previously a plainclothes Japanese soldier to prevent scavengers from crossing the area. When the reporter visited the area yesterday afternoon, the plainclothes Japanese soldier had been withdrawn, and the barbed wire fence had been thickened with several layers. Scavengers residing in Zhabei who do not have permits will no longer be able to pass through the area. According to residents in the area, in addition to forcibly injecting vaccinations, the Japanese army notified residents that they must have vaccination certificates to obtain resident permits when they first took over the new defense zone. Although this has not been implemented, many residents have moved out due to the inconvenience of living in the special area of Hongkou. Landlords have posted notices everywhere due to the vacant houses, but there are few inquiries.

### Citizens' Fundraising Association Holds Award Ceremony

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Citizens' Fundraising Committee has scheduled an award ceremony to commend the enthusiasm of various sectors in supporting relief efforts. The ceremony will be held at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association on the 18th of this month. The association has already sent letters to each donor and fundraising team leader who meet the award standards, inviting them to attend. That day is the anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Association, and important figures from the association will attend the meeting to give speeches.

### Two Tram Companies Take Back Damaged Tokens

New Tokens to Be Discontinued Immediately

The token notes of the tram companies in the two concessions were discontinued after the Bank of China issued fractional currency notes. However, because the fractional currency notes did not circulate smoothly, the tokens were reissued after eight days. Recently, because the Bank of China has issued all 500,000 fractional currency notes and the circulation in the market has gradually increased, a second batch of 500,000 is about to be issued. It has been learned that the company has stopped issuing tokens starting today and has instructed all ticket sellers to collect damaged tokens and not to reissue them.

### Rails on Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Damaged; Passenger Train Derails Yesterday Morning

A passenger from Hangzhou who arrived last night said that the early train from Hangzhou to Shanghai derailed shortly after passing Linping at 6:00 AM yesterday morning because the rails had been destroyed by a mobile unit of the Chinese army. Many Japanese soldiers and passengers were killed or injured. After hearing the news, the Japanese army in Hangzhou sent an engineering train to the scene of the accident to repair the damaged rails. The passenger train that departed from Hangzhou at 1:00 PM arrived in Shanghai last night. According to the passenger, a locomotive and several first and second class cars were lying on the side of the road near Linping.

### Centenary Commemoration of Daguerre, Inventor of Photography; Aurora University Opens Photography Exhibition; Display of Lang Jingshan's Works

— Reporter

In the last decade, the Chinese people's fondness for photography has developed widely. Groups studying photographic techniques exist everywhere, and many world-renowned works have been produced.

The merits of the person who invented photography are no less than those of Edison and Marconi. Yet there may be people who love photography and do not know who invented it. Is this not strange? We respect Edison and Marconi, but we cannot help but express our admiration for Daguerre, who invented photography! As we commemorate the centenary of Daguerre's invention of photography, we should first introduce Daguerre himself.

Daguerre, Louis Jacques Mandé, was French, born on November 18, 1789, in Cormeilles, Seine-et-Oise. He was originally a painter. In 1822, he opened a panorama studio in Paris and also established one in London. In 1826, Daguerre began to study photography with Niépce. Soon after, he studied it on his own. After thirteen years of painstaking effort, he finally succeeded. In 1839, it was made public to the world. This year marks the centenary. Daguerre passed away on July 12, 1851. The film used by Daguerre at that time was a metal plate. Later, through the inventions of countless people, it went from metal plate to glass plate, and even to today's film. However, when we trace the source of the invention, we always attribute it to Mr. Daguerre.

The Aurora University Photography Research Society, in commemoration of the centenary of Daguerre's invention of photography, is holding a Lang Jingshan Photography Exhibition. Lang's works are rich in pictorial and poetic meaning. The compositions he adopts are harmonious and beautiful, making people feel like they are seeing a painting. This is universally admired by Chinese and foreigners alike.

Lang recently returned from a tour of the southwest. He has taken more than a hundred famous photos in various provinces (which have been printed by the China Travel Service in a book called "Scenery of the Southwest," which was sold yesterday at the Aurora University venue). All of them have been enlarged and sent to the Aurora Exhibition. We all yearn for the active appearance of the southwest. Now, after seeing these famous works, it is as if we are in the southwest, and the entire potential of the southwest is revealed to us one by one.

The exhibition opened yesterday afternoon. Although the roads were flooded, the attendance was still very enthusiastic, with more than 300 people. At 2:00 PM, Father Cailmeng, the president of Aurora University, gave a short speech, followed by a speech by Dr. Ferguson. Everyone could understand what Mr. Ferguson said in Chinese. He said: "We should not only admire Daguerre's greatness in inventing photography, but we should also strive to learn Daguerre's spirit of research. Now, only Mr. Lang Jingshan has this spirit, so he can have great success."

These few words aroused enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. Undoubtedly, Mr. Lang can truly accept it without shame! Lang is a member of the Royal Photographic Societies of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as a member of the Photographic Society of America. He has won 58 awards at photography exhibitions around the world. Lang is the first Chinese person to receive this honor. Now, excerpts from Lang's published commemorative text are listed below:

I have been deeply interested in photography since I was a child. I often think that the images of things in the universe can be transmitted far and wide and preserved for a long time, while still resembling the scenes at the time. There is no way to do this other than photography. This kind of image preservation is more accurate than the description of words and pictures. The wedding photos of my late father seventy years ago still vividly show the scene at that time.

This year's bumper harvest in Sichuan can supply needs for ten years. Although it is due to the endowment of fertile land, the contribution of water conservancy is also great. Its water conservancy project is an ancient method from thousands of years ago. Now, by using photography, it can be easily studied and referenced by people from various countries. Other similar approaches can be assisted by photography and widely disseminated or discussed. From this, we can know that photography has a huge relationship with society and various academic disciplines.

In recent years, fine art photography in various countries around the world has been refined. In addition to the mechanical function of recording images, people seek for artistic interest. It has transformed from mechanical to artistic, and its progress is amazing. The composition and principles adopted are mostly the same as those of Chinese painting. For example, combining several films and printing them into one is like Chinese painters arbitrarily taking and discarding scenery, creating an ideal new realm. This is one method.

Although photography has advanced into the realm of art, it is not only for personal enjoyment, but also returns to culture. Therefore, it makes great efforts to contribute its functions to industry, medicine, and other fields. In short, any invention or promotion of science must aim at human happiness in order to have an indelible value. With this in mind, we are once again reminded of the invention of photography by the pioneer Daguerre. Because of his invention, we have entered today's advanced field, and his achievements are very great. Now, on the centenary commemoration of Daguerre's photography, and the third anniversary of the Aurora Photography Research Society, I am honored to be asked by the president of Aurora University to publicly exhibit my photographic works here for commemoration. Therefore, we have set the opening ceremony for October 14 in the auditorium of the new building of Aurora University. We respectfully hope that all distinguished guests will come to visit and instruct us. Starting the next day, tickets will be sold, and all proceeds will be used by the Aurora Photography Research Society to promote medical research and photography equipment. Starting November 1, there will be another exhibition for five days. The proceeds from the tickets will be used to help the refugees in the mainland. However, a cup of water cannot save a cartload of burning firewood, and the humble intention is thankfully noted by all sectors.

The exhibition is open to the public today, but only for this one day. Everyone, I think, will not miss this opportunity.

### Auspicious Day, Good Time, Bride Refuses to Get Into Sedan Chair; Suddenly Changes Her Mind After Agreeing; Groom's Family Disappointed and Files Case for Negotiation

Yesterday at 3:00 PM, at the intersection of Route Paul Henry and Avenue Albert in the French Concession, a strange incident occurred in which the bride was hidden away by her father-in-law and the marriage was refused. The details are recorded below:

Employed as a Postal Worker

Wang Guantao, a native of Ningbo, is 26 years old. He lives at 33 Lane K, Xitaihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road. His parents are still alive. After leaving school at the age of 19, Wang was admitted to the Shanghai Postal Administration and worked as a postal assistant. He was highly regarded by the authorities for his diligence. In June of this year, he was promoted to postal worker.

The Mi Family Has a Daughter

A fellow townsman of Wang's named Mi Qinshu, 44 years old, has been operating a Xinhetai tobacco and sundries shop at 518 West Route Paul Henry for many years. Mi has a beloved daughter named Mi Weiji, 29 years old, who is quite beautiful. She graduated from the Cunde Primary School at 14 Gu Baal Road.

Formal Engagement

Through the matchmakers Wang Yihua (representing the groom's family) and Ye Hongzeng (representing the bride's family) and witnesses Zhu Chengyuan and Sun Wenyuan, the Wang and Mi families formally engaged on the 15th day of the fourth lunar month of this year. The bride's family requested a bride price of 320 yuan, gold jewelry worth 200 yuan, and clothing expenses of 60 yuan, all of which were provided by the groom's family.

Refusal to Marry

Two months ago, the groom's family specially hired the famous Shanghai astrologer Zhen Zuobi to choose an auspicious wedding day. As a result, it was decided that the wedding ceremony would be held on the 14th of this month (yesterday) at the Fuxing Garden Restaurant on Wuma Road. The matchmakers and witnesses notified the bride's family. However, on September 4, the Wang family suddenly received a letter from the Mi family stating that the bride had recently suffered from stomach problems and requesting a postponement. At that time, the groom's family, in view of the fact that an auspicious day had already been chosen, was reluctant to change it rashly. However, the bride's family firmly refused.

Negotiations for the Wedding

The Wang family had no choice but to file a petition with the Second Special District Court requesting mediation to fulfill the marriage. On September 19, the court held a hearing. The bride's family hired lawyer Shen Zongyong to represent them in court. Mediation failed. Then, they went to lawyer Shen's office for negotiations. At that time, the father-in-law, Mi Qinshu, and the bride, Mi Weiji, both attended in person. As a result, both parties agreed to the wedding yesterday. Mi Qinshu wrote a letter promising to do so on the spot.

Suddenly Changes Face Again

The groom's family, believing that this matter had gone through legal procedures, expected that there would be no changes. They sent out wedding invitations to notify relatives and friends. Yesterday, the auspicious day arrived. At 3:00 PM, the groom's family specially hired a decorated sedan chair to go to the bride's house to pick her up. However, when the chair arrived at the Mi residence, the father-in-law suddenly reneged on the previous agreement and refused to go through with the wedding, claiming that the bride's stomach pain had not healed and that she was not suitable to pass through the door.

Photographing as Evidence

At that time, the groom's family knew that the father-in-law was intentionally making things difficult. They temporarily hired Dr. Simon from Guangci Hospital to diagnose the bride to determine whether she really had a disease. However, this was also rejected by the bride's family. At this point, the groom's family had no choice but to take a photo of the decorated sedan chair parked in front of the bride's house and report the incident to the Songshan Road Police Station to file a case, deciding to sue according to law. At that time, the water on Route Paul Henry was knee-deep, and onlookers stood in the water to witness this rare and strange event.

### Sewing Employee Poisoned by Eating Crab

Stomach Pain in the Middle of the Night; Sent to Hospital for Treatment

Wang Yuangao, a native of Ningbo, 33 years old, is working as a tailor in the clothing department of the Japanese-owned Fuki Company at 222 Qiwupu Road. The night before last, Wang bought three large crabs and happily cooked and ate them. He then went to bed. However, in the middle of the night, he suddenly felt stomach pain, which worsened by dawn. He groaned continuously. When his companions learned of the incident, they summoned an ambulance at approximately 6:00 AM yesterday morning and sent Wang to the Hudong Hospital for treatment.

### World Christian Student Special Public Prayer

Held Today in Various Parts of the World; Grand Gathering of Students in This City

The World Christian Student Federation has launched a temporary student public prayer, to be held on October 15 in various parts of the world, to pray for truth and peace. The Joint Committee of Christian Student Groups in this city has scheduled a citywide student public prayer to be held at 2:00 PM today at St. Peter's Church at the intersection of Avenue Road and Chengdu Road. In addition to students from various schools, many foreigners residing in Shanghai will also participate.

### Jiuru Money Shop Robbery Case; Reward for Arrest; Main Criminal is the Shop's Driver

The Jiuru Money Shop at 84 West Seward Road in Hongkou was robbed of a total of 190,000 yuan in cash and other valuables the day before yesterday. It was later discovered that Chen Qingtao (also known as Yu A'gen), a driver from Chongming employed by the shop, was the mastermind of the crime. In addition to the police department's strict efforts to arrest and bring him to justice, the shop has offered a reward of 15,000 yuan for the arrest of the criminal.

### Teahouse Owner Shot Dead

Shen Hanting, a native of Anhui, 49 years old, has a wife, Chen, and a son, Xi Ji, 25 years old. Shen has considerable potential influence in the Hongqiao Road area. People call him the Anhui Boss. Last fall, Shen opened the Wanjiang Tea Garden at 379 East of the Wenshu Academy on Hongqiao Road, also operating a hot water stove. The business was not bad. Shen's whole family lived in the shop. The night before last (the 13th) at 8:30 PM, Shen went out to visit a friend. When he walked to a small alley nearby to the east (60-70 yards from his home), he was suddenly shot by an enemy. He was hit in a vital area and fell to the ground and died on the spot. When the police arrived after hearing the sound, the murderer had already escaped. Shen had already died of his injuries. After the incident, residents in the area went to watch, only to learn that Shen Hanting had been shot and killed. They notified Shen's family. The police station in the refugee area reported to the Lujiawan Police Station. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuantang mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the prosecutor assigned by the Second Special Court arrived at the scene for an autopsy. The autopsy determined that the deceased Shen Hanting had indeed been shot and killed. The body was handed over to his son to prepare a coffin and collect the body, and to await the arrest of the murderer.

### Notice of Sudden Suspension of Postal Money Orders to Fenghua

Postal money order services between Shanghai and Fenghua city have been temporarily suspended by the Shanghai Post Office starting yesterday. However, postal money order services between Shanghai and the two localities of Xikou and Huizheng Bridge, which are under the jurisdiction of Fenghua County, will continue as usual. According to inquiries made by reporters at the Domestic Remittance Management Office of the Shanghai Postal Administration, the reason for the suspension of remittances between Shanghai and Fenghua is due to omissions in the Zhejiang District remittance clearing list recently sent to Shanghai by the Zhejiang Postal Administration. A letter has been sent to the Zhejiang Administration for inquiry. However, until a reply is received, all Shanghai post offices will temporarily suspend the issuance of money orders to Fenghua County.

### Shooting Occurs in a High-Class Brothel on Pingwang Street; Two Japanese Nationals Injured, One Prostitute Killed

At approximately 9:00 PM last night, in the Meijuan high-class brothel, No. 26 Pingwang Lane, Pingwang Street, Guangdong Road, Li Dingshi, identified as an official from the "Avenue Municipal Government" and "Director of the Public Works Bureau," was treating Meijuan to drinks. Japanese guests were also present, and a lavish banquet was in full swing, with many women in attendance, creating a lively atmosphere. Unexpectedly, at around 10:30 PM, as the guests and hosts were enjoying themselves, two men dressed in blue cotton long gowns and another man dressed in a gray cotton long gown suddenly came up the stairs, barged into the room, and without saying a word, pulled out box-type pistols from their pockets and opened fire.

Bullets Like a String of Pearls

The guests present were greatly alarmed and scattered in all directions. However, two Japanese guests who were in the direct line of fire, and Sanbao (15 years old), a young prostitute from the Xiaoqiaohong high-class brothel in Huile Lane, were unable to dodge in time and were hit by stray bullets. Sanbao, after being hit in the head (temple) by a stray bullet, did not realize it at first and tried to escape, but collapsed and

Died on the Doorstep

of the Meimei Brothel.

As for the two Japanese nationals who were hit by stray bullets, it is reported that one was hit in the chest and the other in the arm. They reportedly tried to fight back after seeing that the assailants had emptied their first round of bullets, and were subsequently struck on the head with the gun butts. The assailants then hastily fled downstairs, leaving the second round of bullets at the entrance of the stairs. After the incident, Chinese Detective Yun Fuxun and Western Detective Zhang Peilin of the Laozha Police Station immediately arrived at the scene.

Immediately Arrived

They urgently transported the injured Japanese to Fumin Hospital. At the same time, Japanese police officers also arrived to conduct an investigation. According to subsequent investigations, one of the injured Japanese nationals was identified as Ikeda, while the other's identity is unknown. Sanbao of Xiaoqiaohong was summoned by a Wang surname guest and was sitting facing the door when the shooting occurred. Next to her was another prostitute named Tanchun, who escaped injury by quickly lying on the ground,

Avoiding Disaster

Which was fortunate. People from the Meijuan brothel and other related persons were all taken to the police station for questioning after the incident. At the same time, nearby establishments such as the Meinengzhen Restaurant were also thoroughly inspected. A row of bullets was also taken to the police station for study, and orders were given to pursue and arrest the criminals.

### Women Brawl, Yang Shen Dies

Yang Shen, a woman residing at No. 7, Lane 1161, Haining Road, suddenly got into an argument with Zhu Shi, a woman living in the same residence, and her 18-year-old daughter, Zhu Er'nan, over a minor matter yesterday. They engaged in a physical altercation. Shortly thereafter, Yang Shen's face turned pale, and she was rushed to the Refugee Hospital on North Xizang Road for treatment, but it was too late, and she died. Ji Xiuquan, a detective from the Huisi Police Station, was dispatched to transport the body to the mortuary for examination and detained the Zhu mother and daughter at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, requested a postponement because the coroner's report was not yet available. Judge Jiang ordered a postponement for further review.

### Ningbo Province Asks for Exemption from Foreign Exchange Settlement for Medicinal Materials

Since the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to announce that "all native goods shipped to Shanghai must be settled in foreign exchange," the volume of goods shipped from Ningbo to Shanghai has decreased sharply. Merchants of native products from Ningbo and Shaoxing have requested modifications. It is reported that the Yin County Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that native medicinal materials from various counties in Zhejiang Province and those transshipped to Shanghai through the interior all use Ningbo as an export hub. Once foreign exchange settlement is implemented, costs will rise sharply, inevitably affecting exports and pushing pharmaceutical merchants and farmers into a desperate situation. They have petitioned the Ministry of Finance to consider the commercial situation, withdraw the order, and exempt them from foreign exchange settlement.

### Increase in Airmail Rates to Southeast Asia

The Shanghai Postal Administration announces that from today, the additional airmail surcharge for all airmail letters destined for Indochina, British India, Malaya, Siam, Burma, India, and Iran, carried by British Imperial Airways planes departing from Hong Kong, will be uniformly increased to 65 cents in national currency per five grams. The same increase will apply to airmail letters arriving from various Western locations and carried by the company's Hanoi-Hong Kong leg.

### Nehru's Autobiography Published

Jawaharlal Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, visited China in August and was warmly welcomed by all sectors. Born into a wealthy family, he dedicated himself to the national revolution. His international reputation is comparable to that of Mahatma Gandhi, and he is also highly literary. The famous British writer, Miss Ottoline Morrell, once called him one of the eleven greatest contemporary writers. Several years ago, while in prison, he wrote an "Autobiography," narrating his lifelong struggle. The National Association of Chinese Youth Associations, with the author's consent, entrusted Hu Zhongchi, Mei Yi, Feng Binfu, and Kuai Si to translate it into Chinese. The entire book consists of 300,000 words, is beautifully written, and includes a portrait of Nehru and his personal letter to the Chinese people. It has already been published and is being distributed by the Youth Association Bookstore on Museum Road. The price is two yuan for the paperback and two yuan and fifty cents for the hardcover.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday states that the Shandong area is clear with southwest to southeast winds. The weather here is cloudy and quite hot, with no fixed wind direction. There was fog in the morning. The East China Sea will change from cloudy to overcast with showers and no fixed wind direction. The hurricane in the Pacific Ocean is clearly moving northwest by west. The center of the hurricane was located within 120 miles of 19 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM. The wind direction is northwest or northwest by west, and the wind force is unknown. Also, in the 24 hours prior to 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 85.5 degrees and the lowest was 70.5 degrees. The highest temperature on the same day last year was 78.1 degrees and the lowest was 66.9 degrees.

### Four Workers Sentenced to Death in the Hengfeng Textile Mill Fire Case

In the past, fires frequently occurred in the Hongkou area. The Japanese side believed that they were caused by Chinese anti-Japanese arson groups. After the fire at the Hengfeng No. 2 Textile Mill in Hongkou on May 9, four workers were identified by the Japanese side within the factory. The Japanese side subsequently announced that those arrested were members of the arson group, led by a Zhang who was at large. It is now reported that the four workers who were identified by the Japanese side as arsonists were all sentenced to death by the Japanese military tribunal yesterday.

### How to Train Your Brain

— Ping

People rely on their hands and brains to do things. The brain is an organ that receives sensations and initiates reactions; it's the commander-in-chief of the entire body. A person's success or failure, intelligence or foolishness, is greatly related to the agility of their thinking. Inventors, politicians, military strategists, and writers – all of them create great achievements through their intelligent brains. For example, a military leader on the front lines, without a smart brain, cannot make decisions from thousands of miles away. Similarly, a great politician who manages internal affairs, if he doesn't have correct thinking, will turn the country into a chaotic mess, causing suffering for the entire nation. The examples above are about major issues concerning the nation and its people. As for personal matters, there are countless instances of people making a single mistake that leads to lifelong regret. Physical disability is certainly unfortunate, but unsound thinking causes even greater pain. Therefore, how should we train our brains?

When a person is born, their brain is pure, without any bad thoughts. So why are there thieves in society? These people's thinking has gone bad, and they are willing to commit crimes. Who wants to be a bad person? I can say that no one does, but to prevent one's thinking from going bad, one must train the brain from an early age.

Children! Your brains are all pure, but why are some smart and others not? Because some are willing to train their brains, while others are not. But children must be asking me, how do we train our brains?

Training the brain isn't difficult. We just need to read more and write more. When we don't understand something, we should think about it more and not just ask the teacher without trying. We must make our thinking correct, not distorted. When something shouldn't be done, no matter how much people try to entice or persuade us, we must show firm resolve and reject them. And when something should be done, even if it means facing danger, we must do it regardless. Since ancient times, there have been loyal ministers and treacherous officials, all differentiated by a single thought. Children are still young, and they will bear great responsibilities for the country in the future. Therefore, how should you train your brains well, to make them sound, correct, and smart? Because your lifelong happiness depends entirely on it. Brain training must start from a young age; it's useless when you're older. Foolish children should train actively, and even smart children should train into exceptional minds, so that they can accomplish great deeds in the future. The country's future and your personal happiness are heavily dependent on the brain.

### The Tiger

— He Gongchao

The tiger, pursued by hunters, was shot several times and seriously wounded. Bleeding, it fled, with the hunters hot on its heels. Soon, it reached the edge of a cliff, finding itself with no escape and its life in danger. Suddenly, it glimpsed a pair of adorable cubs frolicking on the grassland below the cliff. Focusing its gaze, it realized they were its sons. It roared loudly, about to jump off the cliff and die beside its sons, when it heard the sound of the hunters' footsteps, growing closer along the trail of blood. If it jumped off the cliff at that moment, it would lead the hunters to discover its sons. But, if it didn't kill the hunters, they would sooner or later find its sons. To protect its offspring, it gave up on suicide and chose to fight.

It quickly lay on its back in the grass, enduring the groans, holding its breath, and conserving its last bit of energy. A moment later, the hunters searched to its side. It leaped up and wrestled with the hunters. After a long struggle, the tiger and the hunters collapsed to the ground, dead.

Its sons continued to frolic lively on the grassland, completely unaware that their mother had fought bravely and died to protect them.

In this great era, we must not only be unafraid of death, but also consider how to die more meaningfully.

### Entering the City

— Bai Zheng

—Ming'er's Refuge Diary, Part 38—

After a night of wind and a day of rain, the temperature in the atmosphere dropped significantly as the wind blew and the rain fell continuously. The sunlight had long been blocked by the rain clouds, unable to penetrate. Sometimes it peeked out from the clouds, but disappeared in an instant. When the wind had passed and the rain had stopped, the sky was as clean as jade, and the tender sunlight shone on the earth, also reducing its temperature. People often felt the stimulation of cold air on their bodies. It was already late December, approaching the Gregorian New Year. No wonder the weather was getting colder. Ming'er had spent more than a month of leisurely and peaceful days in that village. There were no planes, no soldiers, and no news of the outside world. Everyone lived their lives peacefully, truly a haven in the human world, a Shangri-La in a time of chaos. However, the prices of goods from other provinces had soared to exorbitant levels, while the local products of the nearby villages were, in Ming'er's eyes, cheaper than cheap—sweet potatoes for one jiao per ten catties, eggs for one yuan sixty or seventy, and firewood and charcoal for one yuan three or four hundred catties—so Ming'er ate eggs every day, for breakfast and dinner, and was getting tired of them.

Fortunately, they had two clear and warm days, but good times don't last. Next came cloudy weather, with no sunlight all day, and the temperature dropped even further. It was clearly a sign that snow was about to fall. All the heat in the air had been taken away by the snow, which further controlled the distribution of heat, heavily sealing the source of heat with dark clouds. It also unleashed the violence of the wind, roaring in the bare treetops, trying to drive the remaining heat to thousands of miles away. All of these scenes were a prelude to snowfall.

"After it snows, where will we go to buy vegetables?" This question was worrying Ming'er's mother, because for the past month, they had managed to get by thanks to the landlady constantly sending them vegetables and begging the neighbors to sell them some. Now, seeing the impending snowfall, she needed to urgently solve the problem of "food," because this problem was quite important. No wonder the old lady was anxious.

After inquiring around, they found out that the "vegetable" problem could be solved in the county town, which was more than ten li away from the village. So one afternoon, Ming'er and his older brother, carrying baskets and ropes, and their father, carrying a walking stick, set out on the road to the city. In normal times, buying vegetables was always the job of the maids, but during the escape, personally carrying baskets and going to the faraway city to buy vegetables was a first for the three of them.

In front, beside, behind, and on both sides of the legs were green bean fields, with the soybeans filling the ground, arranged in neat rows, and the plots divided clearly. The road was inlaid in the middle of these crisscrossing field banks. This journey of more than ten li was completed by their three pairs of feet in about an hour, and they stepped into the city.

The county town was very dilapidated. The battlements on the low city walls were scattered, and the withered weeds densely covered the walls, as if painting them with a layer of old age. The stone slab road was uneven, and one could easily get their foot caught in the cracks if they weren't careful. Although they had entered the city, pedestrians were scarce, and the people living in the county town seemed to be afraid of them, hiding in their homes and not daring to come out.

After turning two corners, there were more than twenty stone steps. They walked up the stone steps without much effort, and the ground was much lower. It turned out that the city walls were built on a small hill, and the terrain of the entire county town was very low-lying, resembling a basin. Therefore, the city walls only needed to be built so low to be sufficient. However, looking up in the city, they appeared巍然高大。

### The Blue Dwarf (4)

— Ai Li

The uncle smiled, answering each of A Li's questions. However, A Li stood beside the sofa, looking at the aunt very seriously, and quietly asked, "Aunt, please answer my question seriously, is there really a dwarf country in the world?" It turned out that she thought the aunt's explanation to A Li was just an excuse, afraid that A Li would be afraid of dwarfs in the future, so she deliberately made it sound so bland and ordinary. She had previously read geography and knew that the Laplanders and Finns in Northern Europe were all very short, which could be considered dwarf countries. But she didn't know if there were dwarfs living in the nearby forests, because geography books never mentioned this. The aunt was older and had been here before, so she should know very clearly. Moreover, she had just clearly seen a dwarf walking past the window. Perhaps there were many dwarfs like him living in that forest? And the blue dwarfs made in porcelain might be modeled after them. It would be best to verify it, that would be interesting.

A Li thought to herself, "According to A Li's guess, those blue dwarfs in the porcelain factories might be made according to real dwarfs. Next time I walk through the forest, I must pay attention to see if there are any dwarfs living there."

These thoughts were swirling in A Li's mind. Her eyes were fixed on her aunt's face as she asked very seriously, "Aunt, do you say that dwarfs are really a type of human?" The aunt said solemnly, "Yes, why would I lie to you? We don't need to mention this question again. Hurry up and pack everything up, your uncle has prepared the car."

The uncle chimed in, "Yes, it's prepared. A Li, but I'm sorry, this car is not an ox cart, because we need to hurry on our way and cannot sit in an ox cart and walk slowly through the forest. The car I have prepared is a very good carriage, it drives very fast. But we also have to stop for a while after driving for one or two hours, partly to let the horses rest and feed them something, otherwise we won't be able to continue on our way tonight."

The aunt took the packages and luggage, and walked out the door with A Li and A Li, asking, "You said we should stop for a while on the way, where do you plan to stop?" The uncle said, "There is a small village in the middle of the forest, and there are people there who can take care of the horses. We ourselves also need to sit down for a while and have a cup of coffee. I remember that I had been to this beautiful and lovely little village before, and I also want to linger there for a moment now."

A Li was listening attentively, and couldn't help but mutter to herself, "A beautiful and lovely little village in the forest! That place may be very close to where the dwarfs live, and it's not far from here. Didn't we just see the old dwarf?"

After they all got into the car, the coachman cracked the whip and the car moved forward. Although it was afternoon, the weather was still very hot, and the first part of the road was bland and uninteresting. Later, the road gradually opened up, and they arrived in the wilderness and entered a large pine forest. A Li became happy and quickly asked her uncle, "Uncle, is this a very big forest?" The uncle was a little tired and answered casually, "Yes, very big, very big." Then there were no more words. A Li looked up and saw that he and her aunt had both drooped their heads, as if they were about to fall asleep. But A Li was very excited and had no intention of sleeping. (To be continued)

### The Monkey and the Spectacles

—Krylov's Fable—

Once upon a time, there was a monkey, old and with failing eyesight. He heard people say, "This misfortune is not so serious, as long as you have a pair of spectacles." So he took half a dozen pairs of spectacles and looked at them upside down, glancing at this side and that side. At one moment he put the spectacles on his neck, at another moment he put them on his tail. He sniffed them a few times and licked them a few times, but the spectacles were still of no use to his eyesight.

The monkey cried out, "Alas! Why do those foolish creatures listen to the words of idle people? The spectacles they speak of are nothing but lies!" So he took the spectacles and threw them against a stone, smashing them to pieces.

We say things are bad, but in reality, we ourselves do not understand. (Translated by Zhao Yilin) Helping Effect

Entertainment World Mao Zedong Lan Ping

### Marriage Not a Fact

— Pei Fei

Last month, Reuters telegraphed that Mao Zedong would marry actress Lan Ping in Chongqing, which caused a sensation in Shanghai. Everyone regarded it as a romantic anecdote in the political world and a fascinating story in the art world.

The news about Lan Ping (real name Li Yunhe) marrying Mao was first spread in Shanghai, but it was not actually by Reuters; as early as two months ago, Qu Shigong, who specializes in writing "Anecdotes from the Drama World," had already revealed this news in the film and drama weekly of the Sino-American Daily. The difference between the news spread by the two was that Qu Shigong said that Lan Ping had already been living with Mao Zedong, while Reuters said that Mao Zedong would marry Lan Ping.

Recently, according to a letter from a friend in northern Shaanxi: the news spread in Shanghai about "already living together" or "about to get married" is all inaccurate.

He said: "It is a fact that Lan Ping and Mao Zedong are quite close, but marriage is out of the question. The reason and justification are: First, Mao Zedong is a so-called 'married man.' The Communist Party strictly enforces monogamy. As the administrative leader here, he would never do such a 'sexually promiscuous' thing; Second, Lan Ping and Mao Zedong are both people with strong will and rationality, and they would not easily play love games like ordinary people.

"Yes, maybe some people think 'there is no smoke without fire'; then, how could the news be misrepresented? The thing is like this: In the past, Lan Ping was a student at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University of the Red Army in Fushui. Mao Zedong served as a professor of 'Dialectical Materialism' in this school. They met because of their teacher-student relationship. Later, Lan Ping graduated and went to serve as a female student instructor at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. Because she had a strong desire for knowledge, she often went to Mao Zedong to ask for some knowledge. At this time, by chance, Mao's wife, Ms. He Zizhen, ran to the Soviet Union to study at Moscow University. Ordinary short-sighted people saw them often talking together and, without thinking, released rumors that the two were in love..."

That friend is an art instructor at a school there, and he and Lan Ping are very close friends. It goes without saying that he must know Lan Ping's affairs very clearly, so I firmly believe that what he said in the letter is completely true, so I dare to excerpt it here as a refutation of rumors.

### Mei Lanfang's Private Life (3)

— Li Feishu

— Six of Random Memories by the Plum Blossom

Mr. Mei's gentle personality can be seen from these few examples. When he speaks to people, he sometimes hesitates, as if unable to express himself fully. However, when discussing matters and observing people, he has a clear understanding in his mind. He is approachable and never criticizes others. His ability to accept good advice is a key factor in his success. Whether it's about conduct and self-improvement or artistic matters, he doesn't necessarily listen to flattery, but he certainly embraces constructive criticism. All his friends who are close to him praise him for this!

He is courageous and persevering in his work. Although many things are accomplished with the help of friends, he is the central figure and can be considered the driving force. If his will were not firm, his friends would often give up halfway due to many difficulties. The previous trips to America and Russia involved many setbacks! If it weren't for his unwavering spirit, which sustained everyone's intermittent will, I dare say that Mr. Mei's life's work would have "accomplished nothing."

His thirst for knowledge is stronger than that of ordinary people. No matter what he encounters, he carefully investigates its truth, not stopping until he thoroughly understands its intricacies. Especially in regards to drama, he is not ashamed to ask questions and constantly strives for improvement. His innate inclination to improve is why he has reached this point today, with the encouragement of friends being secondary.

In short, his personality is very much in line with the essence of a poet (gentle and kind). In dealing with people, he is humble and courteous. As for art, drama can be considered his first life, which he maintains and cultivates tirelessly. As for his personal flaws, they are not entirely absent. For example, he is sometimes overly cautious, which can lead to indecisiveness. He is too kind to people, which makes him appear weak and easily deceived. Due to limited space here, I won't elaborate further.

New Film Introduction

### Bloodbath in Black Mountain (Continued)

— Qi Hua

"Each Dawn I Die"

Except for the final prison break scene, the entire film almost entirely depicts the righteous friendship between James and George Rafter, and George Rafter's generosity and uprightness in risking his life to clear James's name. Several scenes are very delicate and stirring. Such as: (1) The "close-ups" of George Rafter's intense gaze when James meets his mother and fiancée twice; (2) James's firm refusal to tell the truth after George Rafter's prison break; and the depiction of the dynamics of various prisoners in the factory, etc. The scene of George Rafter escaping from court is also very moving: first, it shows the Red Cross car and another car parked outside the courthouse; George Rafter's surprise when being photographed; James's surprise when watching from the window; the car horn signal; George Rafter jumping from the high building into the Red Cross car, then into another car... Every shot is stirring.

In the final prison break, amid the dense machine gun fire, George Rafter forces Polyte Kye to confess the process of plotting to harm James. After the warden agrees, George Rafter forcibly drags Polyte Kye out the door and dies together in a hail of bullets. The tense atmosphere is extremely strong.

James Cagney maintains his past performance, acting very well in several scenes such as being wrongly accused and firmly refusing to tell the truth. George Rafter is neither handsome nor skillful when playing the "young leading man," and his stiff movements prevent him from achieving much. In this film, because he is suited to the personality, he acts very calmly and powerfully.

Shen Bao Weekly Supplement, Issue 7, International Trends

### Turkey in Rapidly Evolving International Situation: The Anglo-French Group Strives to Win It Over; The Soviet Union Also Wishes to Shake Hands and Make Peace

Hard Work is No Longer the Sick Man of the Far East

The newly emerged Turkey after the European War, due to its hard work and self-improvement over the past decade, has seen gradual progress in domestic politics and increasing prosperity in economic construction. It has become a major stronghold in the Near East. Western European powers such as Britain and France no longer regard it as the sick man of the Near East or treat it as their economic colony. Instead, they look at it with new eyes and strive to win it over, even to the extent of signing mutual assistance agreements with it. If Turkey is threatened by a European aggressor, Britain and France can come to its aid. The meaning of this is not that Western powers such as Britain and France genuinely care about collective security and are willing to risk war to help smaller nations, confronting aggressors to uphold so-called international justice; rather, it means that Turkey straddles Europe and Asia geographically, controlling the passage from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. If such a militarily important area were to be controlled by a powerful, militaristic country such as Germany, Germany's power would extend from Eastern Europe, through the Balkan Peninsula, and reach the Dardanelles Strait, as it did during the last World War. This would not only threaten the security of British and French colonies in the Near East but also pose the danger of controlling the Suez Canal, cutting off the vast British Empire, with colonies all over the world, in the middle. For this reason, the Turkish government was able to invoke the "change of circumstances" clause in 1936 to request the right to fortify the Dardanelles Strait, which was previously restricted from being fortified. After the Montreux Convention, Turkey finally achieved this goal, creating the prelude to cooperation between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Turkey in the Mediterranean. This year, after Czechoslovakia was destroyed by Germany in March and Italy subsequently occupied Albania, the power of the Axis countries threatened to sweep through the Balkans and head straight for Istanbul (formerly Constantinople). Thus, Britain and Turkey signed a mutual assistance agreement in May, and France and Turkey resolved the Sanjak issue and established a mutual assistance agreement. All of this indicates that Turkey, under the leadership of its current leader, Ismet, has achieved great diplomatic success.

Current President Ismet's Policies

Ismet is the successor to Kemal. His name is Ismet Inonu. He was born in Izmir, and his surname is also related to this place because he defeated the Greek army there in the winter of 1922, so he received this glorious name. Like his predecessor, Kemal, he fought for the Turkish Revolution and the freedom of Turkey, leading the people towards a definite, active, and constructive direction to complete Turkey's cultural construction. His foreign policy is "closely related to collective security." He also said, "The policy of collective security, no matter how it changes, remains the remedy in this turbulent era and the only better foundation for building our ideal world."

Diplomatic Relations between Turkey, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France

Turkey's signing of a mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France can be said to be an expression of this ideal. In recent years, Turkey's signing of mutual assistance agreements with Britain and France naturally means that its relations with Britain and France are extremely close. However, Turkey is a country between the Soviet Union and Britain and France, and in the past, Turkish-Soviet diplomacy was also extremely friendly. We know that Kemal led the National Army from Ankara to resist Britain and France, defeated Greece, and received considerable assistance from the Soviet Union. Currently, Soviet-German relations are becoming closer, while Turkey is approaching Britain and France, which is something that the Soviet Union cannot feel at ease about. Now that Britain and France are at war with Germany, the Soviet Union is deeply concerned that Turkey may allow British and French navies to pass through the Dardanelles Strait, enter the Black Sea, destroy the Baku oil fields, or attack Soviet territory along the Black Sea coast. The Soviet Union naturally needs to require that belligerent warships not be allowed to pass through the aforementioned straits and to maintain good relations with Turkey, concluding a mutual assistance agreement. Turkey, in order to ensure its own security and maintain good relations with Britain and France, also needs to obtain Soviet recognition of the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement and to agree with the Soviet Union to consolidate peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu made a trip to Moscow this time. According to reports, the result of the Turkish Foreign Minister's negotiations with the Soviet Union is that a defense agreement between Turkey and the Soviet Union has already been signed. This agreement stipulates that Turkey will close the straits in exchange for the Soviet Union's guarantee of the Balkans. This new diplomatic achievement of Turkey may prevent it from being dragged into the vortex of war and allow it to maintain its mutually benevolent neutrality.

Biographical Sketches

### The British Forward Commander-in-Chief, Viscount Gort, Who Once Served as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Garrison in Shanghai

— Xiuji

Viscount Gort, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army on the front lines on September 4th. General Gort was born in 1886, is currently 53 years old, and is the sixth-generation descendant of the Earl of Gort. During the European War, he was an army captain who led by example and made special achievements. In September 1918, he fought near Borosji and led his team to attack under enemy artillery fire. He was wounded by two bullets, but General Gort ignored them and continued to cooperate with allied mechanized units to complete the mission. In September 4th, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British troops stationed in India as the commander of the army and the principal of the army school. General Gort is good at hunting, enjoys swimming, and is also a speedboat athlete. In 1933, he obtained a pilot's license and became an excellent pilot. Gort is famous for his courage and good fighting skills. In 1927, General Gort led the British Coldstream Guards to Shanghai and served as the commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai. He once went to Japan. He then served as a general in his home country. He is not only an army talent but also a naval and air force talent. When Gort was the principal of the Kimbalesch Officer School, because of his extraordinary energy and fierce nature, the British Army Minister praised his ability and promoted him to the position of Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Now Gort has been reassigned as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army on the front lines. As for the position he left behind, it has been taken over by Sir Aincit, the British Overseas Army Commander.

Economic Knowledge

### The Unpredictable and Volatile Cotton Yarn Market

— Longsheng

Before the Sino-Japanese War, there was no distinction between spot goods and warehouse receipts in the cotton yarn trade. Warehouse receipts were representatives of spot goods. Buying a cotton yarn warehouse receipt meant that you could take the receipt to pick up the goods. Occasionally, if the production and consumption of a certain count of cotton yarn (for example: 6-count, 10-count coarse yarn, or 32-count, 40-count fine yarn, etc.) were not in sync, that is, when "demand exceeded supply," the factory could not deliver all the goods. Therefore, the factory would allocate the yarn according to the order of the warehouse receipt numbers, prioritizing customers with earlier numbers (i.e., those who purchased earlier). If a customer with a later number wanted the factory to expedite the delivery to meet urgent sales needs, they could pay an expedite fee of 10 to 20 yuan per piece to get the requested cotton yarn. This was an occasional and uncommon occurrence.

After the war, the Shanghai Special Zone became an isolated island and also became a haven for the floating capital of wealthy refugees! The rich had no way out for their money? So, in addition to buying gold bars and foreign exchange, they scrambled to hoard yarn, cloth, rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains!

Last year and this spring, 20-count cotton yarn, whether it was from Jincheng, Shuangma, Tiannv, Diqiu, Jinji, or other brands, was around 400 yuan. The difference between the brands was at most 10 or 20 yuan. The price of gold was rising slowly, foreign exchange was gradually tightening, and the source of cotton yarn raw materials, native cotton, was being manipulated and controlled. It seemed that a large supply of foreign cotton was necessary. Speculators who hoarded goods for profit saw the opportunity and desperately hoarded yarn! The price of Shuangma yarn (because it was selling well, everyone thought that Shuangma was the standard yarn) jumped from more than 400 yuan to a peak of 500 yuan! Because the factory issued too many warehouse receipts, it was difficult to cope with the distribution of spot goods. Therefore, the expedite fee was raised to several tens of yuan. At the same time, the market dealers in the market started trading cotton yarn with spot goods and warehouse receipts going their separate ways, each with its own market price. The price of spot goods became higher and higher, while the price of warehouse receipts became lower and lower. Spot goods and warehouse receipts, which were originally one and two, two and one, actually went in opposite directions. This was indeed a miracle in the isolated island cotton yarn market! Later (around the Dragon Boat Festival), the black market for foreign exchange was driven crazy by speculators who, regardless of the country's interests, went long and bought aggressively. In addition, a certain party disrupted the market by buying and selling at the same time. The shrinkage of foreign exchange (British pounds and US dollars) could not be stopped. Banks were facing a very serious situation due to the withdrawal of cash by speculative depositors! Then, like a bolt from the blue, the Ministry of Finance's "Ma" telegram came suddenly! (The Ma telegram limited depositors to withdrawing 500 yuan.) After the banks reopened after the Dragon Boat Festival, speculative depositors switched targets and frantically hoarded cotton yarn, drawing remittances and discounting them. Because of the urgent need for cash, the premiums also soared! (From 60-70 yuan to more than 200 yuan)

After the yarn market broke through the 500-yuan mark, it was like a runaway horse, heading straight for the highest peak. In addition, rumors spread like wildfire in the market, saying that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee's funds would be exhausted, or that the committee would not maintain the black market, fearing that "inflation" would occur. All kinds of rumors abounded, maliciously slandering the fallacy that the legal tender was worthless, so speculative friends could take advantage of the fire and loot, muddying the waters to fish. 20-count cotton yarn went from more than 600 yuan to more than 700 yuan. In particular, the Shuangma brand yarn produced by Shenxin No. 9 Factory was in high demand (the Hong Kong and Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou gangs had a large appetite), and the production volume was relatively large (because 140-150 bales were produced day and night), so the price was particularly profitable. Tiannv, Diqiu, and Te Jincheng were the next most popular. Only Yong'an's Te Jincheng had higher quality. Sometimes it kept pace with Shuangma, and sometimes it was higher than Shuangma. The price of spot goods and warehouse receipts diverged sharply! For example, if the spot price was 700 yuan, the warehouse receipt price was only about 610-620 yuan. At this time, the 30-yuan deposit per piece for yarn warrants had long been canceled (it was still possible to make exceptions at 500 yuan, and speculative friends gained a lot of convenience. With a 300-yuan deposit for ten pieces of cotton yarn, they could get what they wanted.) Financial institutions also did not allow cotton yarn mortgages (when financial institutions did cotton yarn mortgages, large ones charged 70-75% of the market price). Therefore, friends who did spot yarn business had to show off with real strong financial resources. At a minimum, to do ten pieces, you needed to spend more than 7,000 yuan of capital (when the market price was at its sharpest, you needed to pay entirely in cash. For the most part, it was 3-7 payments, which is short for 70% remittance and 30% cash). Otherwise, don't even think about it. As for speculative traders who had remittance funds but no cash funds, then there was another unpredictable business method, that is, if the original yarn payment required 10,000 yuan in cash, it could be changed to a full remittance payment, which would require an additional 10%, for a total of 11,000 yuan. This way, the transaction could also be completed.

When the European war broke out in early September, although foreign exchange increased, the yarn price remained strong and profitable. This was because speculative friends had learned from the experience of the first European war. Moreover, the raw material of cotton yarn—cotton—native cotton was rigidly controlled, and the source of foreign cotton might have problems due to the European war? (This is excessive sensitivity!) Therefore, everyone scrambled to hoard endlessly. In addition, the British-Japanese confrontation situation in Hong Kong eased down, and the outlet for cotton yarn sales was unusually lively, and the yarn's foothold became stronger. As a result of the scramble for purchases from all parties, the peak of the Shuangma brand reached 880 yuan per piece (spot goods). Novice speculative friends, seeing the market situation, hoped for 1,000 yuan per piece and tried their best to collect cash to drag in. Unexpectedly, the cunning ones who were experienced in this way stopped and let the wild wind go, dangling in the shadows attached to the Japanese puppet peace movement! They spread rumors that Konoe and Chen Cheng had flown to Hong Kong to negotiate Sino-Japanese peace, and that there was a Sino-Japanese-German-Italian-Soviet five-nation alliance, etc.! Sure enough, the Guizhou trick was successful! The yarn price plummeted to the 800-yuan mark. Dazzled novice speculative friends were anxious to sell and sold off cheaply at 730-740 yuan. The cunning ones took the opportunity to buy in again. After two or three days, the atmosphere of peace disappeared without a trace. Novice speculative friends lost tens of thousands of yuan in just one day, which was not uncommon, while the cunning merchants were overjoyed and became rich! Since then, due to Foreign Minister Wang's peace talks, although public bonds rose sharply, foreign exchange was released, and the gold price plummeted, cotton yarn was able to be relatively stable, and the fluctuations were not too intense. Currently, Shuangma spot goods are standing firm at around 750 yuan, while the warehouse receipt price has gradually converged, and the difference from the spot price is only 30-40 yuan. Presumably, novice speculators know that it is difficult and have retreated? However, the above description can also give a glimpse of the general strange and unpredictable dynamics of the cotton yarn market. When will we see the light of day in this gambling-style black market and sweep it clean? "Note" The difference between spot goods and warehouse receipts is that after spot goods are priced high, they can be immediately delivered to the outer warehouse or factory. If you buy warehouse receipt goods at a low price, then this warehouse receipt will only be able to deliver spot yarn in two or three months or even half a year. The "spot yarn" delivery slip has no special credentials and is only a warehouse receipt. However, it is clearly marked with the words "spot goods" or "immediate delivery". Readers must know this.

### The New China Travel Troupe, Active Under Fire

— Ciyun

This group of militarized young soldiers grew up healthy in the flames of war

The masters of the new China—children, were forged more robustly and strongly in the flames of war. When the roar of the guns of the July 7th Lugouqiao War of National Liberation sounded, the work of our New China Travel Troupe became even more tense and arduous. At this time, they were doing propaganda work in Suiyuan, a remote area in northern Inner Mongolia. The originally planned route was to develop towards the northwest. However, in view of the importance of the work, they went to places closer to the front line to intensify propaganda work. In June of last year, they arrived in Xi'an. At that time, the situation in Hankou was quite tense, so they specially rushed to Wuhan to participate in the defense of Greater Wuhan. Later, they withdrew from Wuhan and carried out propaganda in the southern part of the country, temporarily stationed in Guilin.

When this travel troupe was first established, our core personnel consisted of only a dozen people. However, after traversing such a vast area and for such a long time, we have absorbed many outstanding children from various places and aspects. Now there are a total of more than fifty people: including more than a dozen girls; the ages of these children range from the youngest eight years old to the oldest eighteen years old, and they are divided into two departments according to their age: the children's department and the youth department. In addition, the entire troupe has three instructors who are over twenty years old! These are old troupe members who have exceeded the prescribed age. There is also an advisor, who is already over thirty years old, but he feels very happy living in the children's circle.

This wandering team is divided into four collective departments that are responsible for leadership: the general affairs department is responsible for daily affairs and economic expenditures; the liaison department is responsible for contacting troupe members and members and for all external communication affairs; the self-education department is the characteristic of this wandering children's team, which is responsible for the education work of the entire troupe, and the library group learning group is compiled according to the literacy level of the troupe members; The propaganda department is the most important work of the entire troupe, responsible for all external propaganda affairs, and constantly preparing propaganda materials internally; each of the four departments has one director, and a cadre committee is established, and a general secretary is produced. , an advisor and three instructors are only of an auxiliary nature. In addition, the Southwest Working Team has recently been established, which is mainly responsible for doing propaganda work in the southwestern provinces; there is also the Wounded Soldiers Working Team, which is dedicated to comforting and serving the loyal and brave soldiers who are injured; there is also a department specifically responsible for training cadres, because the scope of work is gradually expanding, so new troupe members must be continuously absorbed.

The current schedule of life stationed in Guilin is arranged as follows: get up at 6:30 in the morning, practice climbing mountains for one hour for the whole group, wash your face for fifteen minutes, which is held by the river, and the children's department learns to dance for thirty minutes; at the same time, the youth department holds a life review meeting to review the life and learning experience of yesterday, and decide on the life and learning of today; singing together for thirty minutes, eat at ten o'clock, one dish and one soup, because only two meals are eaten every day, the younger children's department eats porridge at eleven o'clock, which is specially provided for the children's department; from 1:30 to 4:30, the youth department goes to the mountain to fight guerrillas, and the children's department begins technical learning, technical learning; including singing, drama, live reporting, dance lectures; then transfer to the mountain to fight guerrillas or technical learning, dinner at five o'clock, go out to perform in the evening or do the work that has not been completed during the day, and sleep at ten o'clock.

The propaganda methods of the whole troupe are divided into films, dramas, singing, speeches, dances, live reports, comics, slogans, wall newspapers, photo exhibitions, and military-civilian conferences. All these techniques adopt the small teacher system, and their own people train their own people. The whole troupe of more than 50 people includes all kinds of people, and the film is made with hand lanterns, and the materials for singing, live reporting and dancing are either compiled by themselves or based on the materials published in newspapers and magazines.

During the carnival held every Sunday, the group can eat some sweets, and self-criticism must be held in this meeting. Every child wears a gray uniform, like a team of young soldiers, because life is indeed militarized. When Guilin was bombed, we worked in the caves.

### The Most Cruel Weapon in Modern Warfare: Poison Gas

Eliminating the enemy's combat capability, an invisible killer that is difficult to defend against.

As the Second World War unfolds, the most deadly weapon known to people—poison gas—will once again unleash its power, posing an immense threat and causing great suffering to people, especially soldiers. This can be stated with certainty. Why is poison gas so deadly and terrifying? Because other weapons kill in a visible way, and there are methods to prevent and defend against them. However, poison gas kills invisibly and is almost impossible to defend against. Other weapons can instantly kill vast numbers of people, but once buried, the matter is over. Poison gas, however, attacks the most tender and unprotected parts of the human body, such as the lungs, eyes, nose, throat, and skin. Valiant soldiers, once poisoned, become completely helpless. Some suffer for minutes or hours, while others endure terrible injuries that require long-term medical treatment to heal. Soldiers in this living-dead state not only lose their combat effectiveness but also cause their commanders to expend great effort and be greatly burdened, as the medical care and supplies for wounded soldiers are always the most difficult problems during combat!

During the last World War, a total of twenty-two types of poison gas were used, with sixteen types that could be mixed. However, only a few were truly effective, easy to mass-produce, and suitable for large-scale deployment. Although chemists have devoted their efforts to inventing new poisonous gases, if poison gas is used in this or future wars, it will likely be the same types that were used last time and proven to be effective. According to their properties, they can be categorized as follows:

1. Asphyxiant gases; 2. Lacrimatory gases; 3. Sternutatory gases; 4. Vesicant gases. However, many type A gases also have the effects of type B or type C gases, so their categorization is sometimes difficult to distinguish clearly.

Asphyxiant Gases

This is a type of gas that causes death. It can invade the lungs, causing congestion and respiratory obstruction. Chlorine gas, first used by Germany in 1915, is the most famous of these gases. Later, other deadly gases were invented, and it was no longer used as frequently. However, chlorine gas remains an important raw material for manufacturing other poisonous gases. For example, Phosgene is made from chlorine and carbon monoxide.

Lacrimatory Gases

These gases have a very strong tear-inducing effect but do not contain toxic components. Therefore, using this type of gas against undefended troops is an excellent strategy. Moreover, a small amount is sufficient to cause widespread disruption, making it a very economical and cost-effective gas.

Sternutatory Gases

The use of these gases forces the opponent to sneeze and vomit repeatedly, forcing them to remove their gas masks, after which other poisonous gases are released to inflict serious or fatal damage. Therefore, this type of gas is like a vanguard that removes obstacles, and its use is the precursor to a true poison gas attack.

Vesicant Gases

There are two types: Mustard gas and Lewisite. The former has enjoyed the reputation of the "king of poisonous gases" since it was first used at the end of the Great War, while the latter, although someone proposed naming it "death fog" and using aircraft to deploy it, has not been put into practice. Mustard gas is made from very common daily chemical raw materials such as alcohol, sulfur, and chlorine gas. It is odorless, and even a small amount has a great effect. It can remain on the ground and in low-lying areas for several days. People who are poisoned do not initially feel any discomfort, but in reality, they have suffered deep and painful injuries. Because this gas has extremely potent vesicant properties, whether it is a gas or a liquid, it can penetrate clothing and cause the skin to blister, swell, sting, and be extremely painful. It is also very difficult to treat, and even minor injuries take weeks to heal. Severe cases can take months. Mustard gas not only burns the human body and harms livestock but can also corrode machinery, making it unusable. Its destructive power is truly great and terrible. Mustard gas does not immediately affect the eyes and throat, but after a few hours, the poisoned person can become completely blind, and it may take several weeks to recover. Releasing a small amount of mustard gas is naturally not easy to detect, but unknowingly, this small amount already has the aforementioned destructive power and subsequent latent effects. Therefore, mustard gas is the most effective of all poisonous gases in destroying the morale of the enemy, so it is no wonder that the world calls it the "king of poisonous gases."

Strange News

### The Man-Eating Tree of Africa

— Xin

In the second year of the Republic, there was a news report about the man-eating tree of Africa. I will write it down below, as far as my memory allows:

Japanese people living in Africa always organize a group to take walks or play in the lush forests of Africa every summer to get fresh air and enjoy themselves. One summer, the Japanese people living in Africa, as usual, formed a group and went on a tour. When they set off, they counted the number of people, brought hunting dogs and bread, and proceeded to their destination. When they arrived at a forest with green grass and lush trees, they sang, walked, and rested. However, when they returned and counted the number of people, one person was missing. Although they searched everywhere, they couldn't find him. In the summer of the twelfth year of the Republic, a group of Japanese people went to the same place to tour. As they were sitting on the ground resting, a hunting dog, because it was thirsty and wanted to find some water to quench its thirst, happened to see some water on a huge leaf of a tree. So, it ran up and licked it with its tongue. Immediately, the leaf stirred and wrapped the hunting dog inside. In a moment, the leaf unfolded, and the hunting dog was gone. Then the group of Japanese people sitting on the ground realized that the Japanese person who had disappeared several years ago had been eaten by that huge leaf!

### All-Out Brawl at the World PEN Congress

— Guanqing

This year's World PEN Congress was held in London. During the meeting, a Belgian representative angered an Italian representative, resulting in an all-out brawl. The Italian representative, Mr. Mannatt, sarcastically said from the Italian perspective: "Italy not only welcomes Fascist writers but also sincerely welcomes those who sympathize with the Fascist system but cannot actively ally with it." The Belgian representative, Mr. Pirade, became enraged upon hearing these words and jumped up, saying: "Yes, we all know that Italy is a land of lambs, and everywhere else in the world except Italy is full of wolves." Mr. Pirade also cited the example of the famous Italian philosopher and writer Croce, saying how the Fascist police searched his house and confiscated his works. Mannatt immediately jumped onto the podium and punched him repeatedly. Finally, the president of the PEN Congress used his highest authority to suppress and resolve the situation, and this scene of a literary brawl came to an end.

After the start of the war, French troops crossed from French territory into German territory. The direction is indicated by the arrow in the picture. This area is the Saar River region, the no-man's-land between the Maginot and Siegfried Lines, which is twenty-five miles wide.
