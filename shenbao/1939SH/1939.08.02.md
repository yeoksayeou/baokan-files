### Chamberlain Issues Another Statement: Britain's Far East Policy Unchanged; Emphasizes Extreme Importance of Potential US Cooperation; Both Countries Have the Same Goals but Need Not Adopt the Same Methods

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, during a foreign policy debate in the House of Commons today, stated that if anti-British riots in North China continue and attacks on British interests there remain unchecked, the British government will have to take a very serious view of the situation. The Prime Minister reiterated that the British government will not alter its Far East policy at the request of other countries. He clarified that the Anglo-Japanese agreement reached in Tokyo is merely a statement of facts, does not imply a shift in policy or recognition of Japan's belligerent rights, does not disregard British interests in China, nor does it intend to cede any rights to third parties. The Prime Minister mentioned recent actions by the United States, saying he believes the general objectives of Britain and the United States are very similar. However, it is not necessary for the two countries to take the same actions. The Prime Minister added that the government attaches extreme importance to possible cooperation between the two countries, and he will keep the United States informed of British actions and planned measures. (Great applause)

### Sinclair Sympathizes with China

The first speaker today was Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the Liberal opposition party, who said that Britain cannot be neutral in the Sino-Japanese war, as British sympathy must naturally lean towards China. Sinclair also questioned whether the recently proposed Anglo-Japanese compromise would hinder the government's assistance to China, and whether the government would refuse to hand over the silver currently in Tianjin to avoid weakening China's ability to resist. He urged the government to consult with the various dominions as soon as possible to take action on Anglo-Japanese trade. Sinclair concluded, "Do not allow Britain to lose another opportunity to cooperate with the United States in the Far East." (Reuters, 31st)

Opposition Labour MP Dalton immediately launched a fierce attack on the government, stating briefly that, given the situation in the Far East, the government's efforts to support Chinese legal tender should not be abandoned, and the export of raw materials to Japan must be prohibited. (Havas, 31st)

### Chamberlain Elaborates on Policy

The Prime Minister then rose to reply, saying that merely knowing the superficial explanations of the plan is insufficient to understand its main purpose. He said that these explanations, which are sufficient to cause concern and distress in China, are created by those who have not made a thorough and fair review of the plan. The government has already made this clear to us. It must be known that this plan is a statement of facts, not implying a change in policy or recognition of Japan's belligerent rights, nor disregarding British trade in China, nor intending to cede any rights to third countries. Sir Archibald Sinclair asked whether the meaning of this plan is that Britain will help Japan maintain what it has gained and not hinder its continued seizures. He wondered why Sir Sinclair would make such strange remarks. If what Sir Sinclair said is true, wouldn't we be supplying good weapons to someone who does not have good intentions towards us? (Applause) Such remarks are not only harmful, but also sufficient to weaken our influence in the world. I reiterate that the government will not change its Far East policy at the request of other countries, and I would also like to declare that Japan has not asked us to do so. In the delicate negotiations currently underway, there are bound to be many difficulties ahead. The most obvious is the anti-British riots instigated and controlled by the Japanese in North China. I now have no choice but to say that if such riots continue and British interests in North China continue to be attacked as before, the British government will have to take a very serious view of the situation. These facts may make it extremely difficult to obtain satisfactory results from the negotiations. The Prime Minister also mentioned China's silver, saying that he must fully discuss this issue with other countries with equal interests before it can be discussed. (Reuters)

### Eden Speaks Up for Justice

Former Foreign Secretary Eden, after rising to speak, stated briefly that the Prime Minister's statement regarding the situation in the Far East was righteous and commendable. One point regarding the Far East situation is very clear: the Japanese government's plan for China has failed. It is particularly difficult to see when the Sino-Japanese War can end, and looking back two years, it feels even more distant. Since last autumn, Chinese morale, public sentiment, and organizational capabilities have been revived. In the un-occupied areas, not only has the army been reorganized, but industry is also being rebuilt. We admire this and should warmly commend it. Japan, unable to achieve a complete victory militarily, wants to promote the collapse of China's monetary system to achieve its victory. Its demand that Britain hand over Chinese silver in the Tianjin concession to the Japanese side and recognize the banknotes of banks controlled by the Japanese is nothing more than an attempt to weaken the position of Chinese legal tender. Now it is trying to induce Britain to collude with it. If Britain were to do so, it would be tantamount to accepting a foreign diktat and changing its policy. The impact would harm the interests of our country in China and in various territories in the East, which is unacceptable. It is gratifying that the Prime Minister has firmly stated that he will not change the policy towards China at the request of foreign countries. I also hope that the government will take a further step to make it clear that it will continue to support Chinese legal tender, which would be even better. Now is the time that if British-Japanese relations are to be improved, the condition should be that Japan ceases instigating anti-British activities in China. As for us, Britain does not lack the ability to act. How this action can be taken can be seen in the US declaration to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. If our government can announce this intention to the Japanese government, national opinion will undoubtedly support it. (Havas)

### Milner Supports the Government

Conservative MP Milner then rose to speak, saying that he was very pleased with the Prime Minister's clear remarks and found them very satisfactory. He then mentioned the Japanese demands regarding Chinese legal tender, asking whether the Prime Minister could make a further statement, not only declaring that Britain will not support Japan's demands, but will also seek to prevent them from becoming a reality. Milner also said that he believed Britain had no reason not to imitate the United States and abolish the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce. He then mentioned the Tokyo plan, saying that if Japan only uses what is included in its literal meaning, he believes this matter is a victory for British diplomacy. However, the whole problem now is what the result of the compromise will be, and whether the British side has any demands. If Japan asks Britain to support its currency, it will inevitably lead to an extremely difficult situation. Milner continued, saying that we are bound by treaties and long-term friendship to support the freedom and independence of a complete China. Britain should take any means to force Japan to withdraw from the impossible position created by the mistakes and arrogance of its leaders. Milner concluded, saying that although Britain has sufficient means, such as economic or financial retaliation, to force the Japanese government to change its treatment of British interests, he would rather resolve this matter through cooperation and friendly discussions.

### Butler Concludes the Debate

Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Butler concluded the debate, saying that negotiations on the Tianjin incident are still ongoing. Certain points regarding police affairs have been agreed upon and are now being reported to the government for consideration. Part of the next procedure will be the consideration of economic and other matters. Butler also mentioned various events regarding police affairs, saying that the government has now decided, according to the accepted plan, to recognize the de facto situation, and to maintain a fair attitude towards certain daily contacts within a limited area and under certain circumstances. Butler continued, saying that he believes that this attitude of acknowledging the de facto situation in the Japanese-occupied areas is the wisest policy for the interests of British expatriates in the Far East and for British policy. Butler concluded by saying that Britain has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government regarding the anti-British riots in North China.

(London) The Labour opposition party intends to hold another foreign policy debate when the government moves to adjourn the House of Commons for the summer recess on August 4th. They will pay particular attention to the overall situation in the Far East. (Reuters, 1st) The diplomatic affairs correspondent of the London Times recently declared, "The British government has clearly analyzed and re-stated its policy toward China, including the points announced by Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, and has even supplemented them. All of these have been included in instructions to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, instructing him to convey them to the Chinese government. Therefore, Britain's efforts to deal with factual issues in North China do not mean that there has been any change in its policy toward China. In other words, it is not a betrayal of China. On the contrary, the British government will continue to maintain its current policy as before." (Havas, 1st)

### British Newspaper Comments

(London) Chamberlain's foreign policy speech has been commented on by various newspapers here. The London Times stated, "Analyzing the international policies pursued by the British government, its main goal in the Far East is to strive for a fair resolution to the war between China and Japan. Its guiding principle is to maintain a position that allows it to exert influence and accomplish this task in the most effective way." The News Chronicle stated that regarding the Far East situation, Chamberlain reiterated in a solemn tone that the initial agreement reached between Britain and Japan does not mean that Britain has changed its Far East policy. This is greatly reassuring. Regarding the relationship between Britain and the United States, there have been many rumors. Chamberlain has now stated that the British government will always notify the US government of all its actions or intended actions. This is also welcomed by the general public. (Havas, 1st)

### Japanese Ambassador to the US Visits Hull

(Washington) After the US government announced the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, Japanese Ambassador to the US Kensuke Horinouchi visited Secretary of State Hull at the State Department for the first time yesterday. The two held talks for half an hour in an effort to reconcile the differences between the US and Japan. (Associated Press, 1st)

Editorial

### Britain's Foreign Policy

"The inaccurate interpretations made by various parties regarding the initial agreement between Britain and Japan are sufficient to cause anxiety and distress in China and should be condemned." This was the solemn statement made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, July 31, when he declared foreign policy. Since the initial agreement was announced, Japan and Germany and Italy have been pleased, and public opinion has been in an uproar. This newspaper has also repeatedly reviewed and condemned it. Is it because of Chamberlain's view of the inaccurate interpretations, all those within his condemnation? Although, ambiguity lies, how accurate is the interpretation? Unilateral consent, almost its toadying demeanor is visible, then empty talk is insufficient to release anxieties, sweet words are insufficient to release bitterness, what remains is to await the facts that are expressed by future Tokyo negotiations as strong irrefutable evidence! Currently, it is somewhat comforting that Chamberlain is able to pay attention to the reaction caused by the initial agreement in China and feel deeply uneasy, then this person is still able to discuss Britain's future and the Far East's future.

The British Parliament is scheduled to adjourn the day after tomorrow, August 4, and will reconvene in two months, on October 3. What Chamberlain declared yesterday was the final statement in this session, so its quality and quantity are more important than usual. He had previously stated that he was unwilling to clearly guarantee that Britain's foreign policy would not change at all during the recess period. This is indeed a sign of a politician being responsible to Parliament and valuing promises, and should not be regarded as Chamberlain taking advantage of the two-month opportunity of Parliament's recess to change his foreign policy. In other words, what was declared yesterday should be regarded in principle as the norm for British foreign policy in the next two months. If there are changes, it will be an accident. Given the clarity and explicitness of the statement, we sincerely hope that there will be no accidents and no changes, and we wish to introduce it to our readers, who should read carefully what is recorded in today's news column of this newspaper, for use as a reference for observing British foreign policy in the next two months.

Chamberlain's statement has four main items: one concerns the Far East, two concerns the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, three concerns Danzig, and four concerns British loans to Poland. Regarding the Far East, there are eight main points: (1) not abandoning British interests in China, (2) not sacrificing the rights of third countries, (3) not damaging Britain's reputation and weakening its influence in various parts of the world, (4) not changing Far East policy at the request of other countries, (5) confirming that the anti-British movement was launched and directed by Japan, and that at least in North China, if Japan does not stop it, it will hinder the success of the Tokyo negotiations, (6) the Tianjin silver problem must be decided only after exchanging opinions with all relevant countries, (7) the US and Britain have the same goals for the Far East, but their actions need not be the same, and it may be more beneficial to have different actions, and (8) cooperation with the United States should be valued, as should that potential for cooperation. Some may think that there are not many new suggestions; however, in our view, we would like readers to pay special attention to the fact that there are subtleties between the US and Britain that cannot be ignored. According to the process since September 18, the intentions of the US and Britain have often been discussed; except for the protest against Japan in January of this year, and the subsequent Gulangyu issue, there was seemingly a parallel view between the two countries; in addition, whether rigid or soft, whether strained or relaxed, almost making those who care about world affairs find it laughable and sad. Not only that, but the interpretations and criticisms made by the various parties that are implicitly opposed to the US and Britain regarding the intentions of the two countries are also divergent and complicated; regarding their parallel actions, they are regarded as coincidental; regarding their consultations, they are regarded as being inside and out; and regarding their motives, they are regarded as the two countries colluding to deal with Japan, or as the two countries disagreeing and vying for hegemony in the Far East. Of course, there is only one truth about these rights and wrongs; there is only one principle about front and back; yet those who interpret and criticize, even though they stand on the side of dissatisfaction with the US and Britain, are different in right and wrong, and in front and back, so why is this the case? This can explain that international problems are far-reaching, so those who are concerned about gains and losses in the midst of them are each seeking their own interests and falling into the contradictions of front and back, right and wrong; it can also explain that the content of international problems is complex, so those who sow discord in the midst of them are trying their best to instigate destruction for their own private interests. As for the US and Britain, Chamberlain's statement that the two countries have the same goals is indeed not deceptive talk, and it is certainly appropriate to say that the two countries have the same basic tone for Far East policy; only because those who see them as goals differ in their perceptions of distance, size, and the inherent conditions for reaching their goals, so that what is expressed in words and actions differs in urgency and importance, and it is not that there is a fundamental conflict between them. For example, the two countries have the same views on stopping Far East aggression; however, whether it can be stopped, how it can be stopped, and when it can be stopped, the distinction lies not in the essence of that objective object, but in the disparity in perceptions and conditions. To prove this, with the abrogation of the Treaty of Commerce, US President Roosevelt subtly operated, and the opposition leader made this proposal, and without waiting for the parliament to pass it, he resolutely did so; while Britain spoke openly of economic sanctions at the beginning of the blockade of the Tianjin concession, and yesterday still said that the opinions of the autonomous territories needed to be consulted. Furthermore, it is proven by the so-called cooperation between the two countries, that the key to Britain lies in the hesitation of the authorities, but when the authorities have no hesitation, they only seek cooperation; the key to the United States lies in public opinion, and when there are measures that are approved by public opinion, they want to take them with an independent posture, without giving up their isolationist consciousness and cooperating. Chamberlain's yesterday's statement on the US and Britain was able to see through the subtleties between them, which is a brand new suggestion in Britain.

In yesterday's British House of Commons, there is also something worthy of a related word: the speech of former Foreign Secretary Eden, which was most rich in political and diplomatic meaning, should be understood by putting oneself in his place and appreciating British national policy and Eden's position. The active suggestions of Eden and Sinclair can be mutually illuminated by the distinction between the ruling and opposition parties in the Conservative and Liberal parties. If Wilson is such a person, he said that apart from condemning the Japanese, there is no way to describe what he hates, but he also said that Britain's actions may not be beneficial to the Far East, so he advocated standing aside and waiting for investment in the future; this can represent the weak-willed elements of the Conservative Party, and their words are not worth mentioning, but it is their ilk who often make Britain gray.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer States Determination to Maintain Chinese Legal Tender; Original Intention Not Changed Due to Tokyo Agreement; UK, US, and France Actively Discussing Measures; £3 Million Loan to Be Established Immediately

(London) During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, Opposition Labour MP Jagger asked the government whether it would continue to maintain Chinese legal tender. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon immediately replied, "The stability of Chinese legal tender is of great importance to Britain and other countries that have significant commercial interests in China, and it should be maintained. The British government's view has not changed due to the preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan." Labour MP Price then asked, "The Japanese are now issuing banknotes in the occupied areas of China in an attempt to control these areas financially. I wonder if Your Excellency can provide an assurance that no special assistance will be given to them?" Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon replied, "What I said a moment ago was very detailed, and I see no need to add anything. As for the Japanese attempt to financially control the occupied areas of China, that is another matter." (Havas, 1st)

(London) Regarding the British loan of £3 million to China, it is said that Overseas Trade Minister Hudson and Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi may be able to reach an agreement this week, which will be implemented immediately. (Associated Press, 1st)

(London) A financial news political reporter reported that the British, French, and US governments are actively discussing the future of Chinese legal tender. This discussion was initiated by the British government, which was forced to take this action by the Japanese monetary demands in the Tokyo negotiations. (Reuters, 1st)

(London) Regarding the news reported by the Financial News that the British, French, and US governments are actively discussing the future of Chinese legal tender, Reuters has learned that there is good reason to believe that France has agreed in principle. However, the means of supporting Chinese legal tender has not yet been discussed. However, according to general opinion, the future plan for assisting Chinese legal tender needs to be considered very carefully, because the current procedures of the equalization fund have many weaknesses. Financiers believe that assistance to Chinese currency cannot be effective unless strict management is given to the issuance of Chinese banknotes at the same time. The scope of application of the equalization fund in the future should be limited to commerce and should not provide foreign exchange for Chinese banknotes. Today, Conservative MPs, when interviewed by Reuters reporters, seemed to have inconsistent opinions regarding Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday on the British government's Far East policy. Those close to the Prime Minister believe that the government will firmly not concede on important issues in North China, which is very gratifying. However, other MPs want the Prime Minister to make more specific replies to questions such as Japanese currency in North China and Chinese silver stored in concessions. They believe that a clear rejection of Japanese demands in the Tokyo conference is not only the most pleasant, but also the wisest path. The Senate may strive to make the government make a sincere statement on this matter during the debate on Thursday. (Reuters, 1st)

(London) The diplomatic affairs correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reported that the British government is seeking the US government's views on several issues in the Far East that directly affect the interests of both countries. The British government took this step because the United States has recently announced the abrogation of the trade agreement with Japan, expressing its attitude. One issue that is related to both Britain and the US is the Japanese side's hope that Britain will support the currency under the Japanese side's auspices in North China and stop supporting legal tender. It seems that the British government does not feel that it has any intention of reaching peace with Japan. Even if the British government has this intention, it cannot do so without the permission of other directly related countries such as France and the United States. (Reuters, 1st)

### US Treasury Secretary to Go to Europe Today

(Washington) Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau recently declared, "I will be going to Europe on August 2 for a vacation and will return home on September 11. This trip is a private matter." (Havas, 31st)

(Washington) Political figures here believe that Morgenthau will discuss currency issues with the British authorities after arriving in London. (Haitong, 1st)

### Anglo-Japanese Subcommittees Simultaneously Convene Yesterday: Regarding the Silver Deposit Issue, Britain States It Has No Right to Resolve It Alone; Maintaining Order in the Concessions; Rumor of a Provisional Agreement Between the Two Parties

(Tokyo) The Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 7:30 PM that the subcommittee discussing the issue of silver currency held two meetings at the official residence of the Vice Minister, from 10:00 AM to noon and from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM on the 1st. It continued to review the issue and reported the results to Minister Kato and Ambassador Craigie. The subcommittee discussing the issue of security also convened on the same day at the same time as the aforementioned committee and reviewed several outstanding items. (1st, Domei News Agency)

(Tokyo) According to a foreign ministry announcement, the subcommittee investigating matters related to the silver issue met for two hours this morning and three hours this afternoon. The subcommittee examining the issue of maintaining peace and order in the British concession in Tianjin held a meeting this afternoon to complete the review of several unresolved issues. (1st, Reuters)

(London) It is heard that a provisional agreement has been reached on the issue of Anglo-Japanese cooperation in maintaining the neutrality of the Tianjin concessions, celebrating it. If the Japanese side can lift the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, the British side is willing to hand over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng. At the same time, it was agreed that the British side would increase its police force within the British concession and allow Japanese military police to cooperate with the British in eliminating terrorist plans. However, Japanese personnel within the British concession cannot exercise administrative power. (1st, Associated Press)

(London) Regarding the situation of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie again submitted a report to the Foreign Office this morning. The content reportedly concerns the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case, which has not yet been resolved. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the silver deposit issue at a meeting this morning and has almost drafted new instructions, which will be telegraphed to Ambassador Craigie immediately. Responsible parties here still insist that the financial issue cannot be resolved by Britain alone, because the location of the silver in Tianjin is not limited to the British concession alone. (1st, Havas)

(London) People here now acknowledge that the Tokyo negotiations have reached a critical stage. The monetary demands made by the Japanese side cannot be accepted by Britain. The British government is now informing other related countries of the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The French government has stated to the British government that France is well aware of Britain's difficulties in the Far East and the broad scope of the issues involved in economic and military strategy. In fact, it can now be stated with certainty that Anglo-French cooperation in the Far East is no less close than in Europe. (1st, Reuters)

(London) Regarding the Japanese demand that the silver deposits of Chinese banks within the Tianjin concession, amounting to 48 million Chinese currency, be handed over to the Japanese side, according to sources close to the government, the governments of Britain, the United States, and France are exchanging views on this issue. When Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with British Ambassador Craigie last week, he had already made this request. Because this silver is stored separately in British, American, and French banks, in roughly equal amounts, it is not convenient to make a decision alone before consulting with the United States and France. However, other local issues can still be negotiated, such as the police issue within the concession, which has already achieved some success. (30th, Havas)

(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Anglo-Japanese subcommittee on economic issues met at 10:00 this morning to continue discussing the legal tender and silver deposit issues. The British representatives were Herbert, the British Consul in Tianjin, and Macrae, the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy in Tokyo. The Japanese representatives were Tanaka, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, and Aoki and Asai, Secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is heard that the British representatives requested that financial experts discuss these issues and that experts from Yokohama Specie Bank and HSBC be invited as consultants, striving to reach a compromise. According to Japanese newspapers, the round table conference held its sixth meeting yesterday. Dennis, the Chief of Police of the British Concession in Tianjin, explained the current situation of maintaining peace and order in the British Concession in Tianjin. The meeting then discussed (1) the wording of "controlling anti-Japanese and Communist elements in the British Concession in Tianjin," (2) the dispatch of a certain number of Japanese military police by the British Municipal Council to "maintain mutual cooperation and contact between Britain and Japan to maintain peace and order," and (3) the requirement to first review anti-Japanese and Communist elements found in the concession in the future. According to the Asahi Shimbun, a subcommittee has been appointed to discuss the details. In subsequent discussions, the Japanese representatives insisted on dispatching 30 Japanese military police, while the British side insisted on greatly reducing the number. The subcommittee adjourned at noon and resumed its meeting at 2:00 PM, clarifying two or three points. However, Japanese newspapers stated that no major difficulties were expected and predicted that the issue of peace and order could be finalized this afternoon. (1st, Reuters)

### British Undersecretary Answers Member's Question: Gives Special Attention to Protecting British Nationals in China

(London) Undersecretary Butler assured the House of Commons today that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo will give full attention to the interests of British trade in China. Butler also answered another question in writing, stating that the British government has immediately considered raising possible negotiations with the Japanese government regarding the drug situation in the occupied areas of China. Butler further stated that the British government has recently continued to negotiate with the Japanese government through Ambassador Craigie regarding the Japanese authorities' small concession to allow British personnel to inspect the routes of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Company. Labor MP Pethick-Lawrence rose to ask whether the Prime Minister would issue instructions to pay special attention to protecting the well-being of British nationals in China who are suspected or hated by the Japanese. Butler replied that the British authorities in various places will take such measures within the possible scope, but it seems unnecessary to issue special instructions. Pethick-Lawrence then asked Butler whether he knew that British nationals in various parts of North China have been severely affected by the current situation and whether there could be any concrete expression other than making extremely vague remarks. Butler replied that he believed his remarks were extremely concrete and that he was very aware of the concerns of the members. (31st, Reuters)

### Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing, Using British-Made Machine Guns: British MP Questions Government

(London) Labor MP Purbrick raised a question in the House of Commons today, stating that since January 1937, how many licenses have been issued for the export of Lewis machine guns manufactured by the Birmingham Small Arms Company in Japan. His reason for raising this question was that a Japanese plane shot down in Chongqing on May 3 was equipped with this machine gun, and its number was A52016. Trade Secretary Stanley replied that, judging from the number of the gun, it was exported to Japan in 1933. Publishing the number of licenses for exporting a particular type of weapon to a particular country would be contrary to the public interest. No licenses have been issued for exporting Lewis machine guns to Japan since December 1937. (1st, Reuters)

### Women's Comfort Committee Holds Second Anniversary Celebration

(Chongqing) The Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Soldiers Fighting for Self-Defense and Resistance held its second anniversary celebration on the 1st. Madame Chiang, Ma Shen Huilian, and representatives from various organizations, totaling over a hundred people, attended. Chairman Shen Huilian reported on the establishment process and future work guidelines. Madame Chiang delivered an impromptu speech, encouraging them to popularize the organization, visit wounded and sick soldiers, and assist soldiers' families, hoping that women compatriots across the country would provide soldiers with spiritual encouragement. The entire group, led by Madame Chiang, went to the urban area and the south bank of Jiangbei to comfort the families of soldiers on expeditions and wounded soldiers. (1st, Telegram)

### Chinese Seek Refuge Within Puppet Manchuria

(Beiping) Wealthier Chinese in "Manchukuo," observing the continued tension between Japan and the Soviet Union, fearing that Soviet aircraft would bomb cities such as Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang, have fled "Manchuria." Today, trains arriving in North China from that region are full of wealthy Chinese. (1st, Reuters)

### Japanese Troops Withdraw from Central China, Related to the European Situation; Offensive on Pinghan Railway Used as Cover; Submarine Base Being Built on Hainan Island

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman, when meeting with reporters today, spoke of the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese troops from central China, particularly in the Yangtze River basin. It is said that the current offensive by the Japanese on the Pinghan Railway west of southwestern Henan Province is merely an action to cover the withdrawal of their troops from central China. The reason for the withdrawal is probably related to the tense situation in Europe. Two divisions of Japanese troops stationed in Hankou have already withdrawn and are being transported downstream. Their heavy artillery units have been loaded onto trains in Pukou and are being transported north via the Jinpu Railway to Manchuria. However, the destination of the infantry units is not yet known. It is either to the north or south to Hainan Island. Regardless of whether they are transferred to Manchuria or Hainan Island, he is convinced that the recent movements of the Japanese troops have international significance. The Japanese are now rushing to build a submarine base on the southern tip of Hainan Island. (1st, Reuters)

(Chongqing) According to information received here, the Japanese troops in southern Henan have been intercepted by Chinese troops. The three routes of Japanese troops invading from the Pinghan Railway, attempting to reach Tanghe, were attacked by Chinese troops counterattacking from the north and recapturing Minggang before reaching halfway. The Japanese troops were forced to retreat. (1st, Haitian News Agency)

### Chinese Troops in Southeastern Shanxi Province: Flanking Strategy Effective; Chinese Troops Recapture Yangcheng and Qinshui; Killing Over 2,000 Japanese Troops

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman told reporters today that there is heavy rain in southeastern Shanxi Province, so the fighting has stopped. The spokesman spoke of the strategy of the Chinese troops there, saying that when a Japanese force advanced west from the Tongpu Railway towards Yangcheng, the Chinese troops attacked it from the north and south. The Japanese troops spying on Jincheng from the south of Qinshui were attacked by Chinese troops from the east and west. This flanking strategy of the Chinese side has been very successful. (1st, Reuters)

(Xi'an) Military intelligence: The Japanese troops in southeastern Shanxi Province have been attacked by Chinese troops everywhere in recent days, fleeing in disarray. In the battles to recapture Yangcheng and Qinshui, over 2,000 Japanese troops were killed. Over 300 Japanese troops who fled north from Dongfeng to Lujiahe were completely annihilated by Chen's troops when crossing the river, with no survivors. (31st, Telegram)

### Elite Chinese Troops Arrive in Shanghai Suburbs

(Chongqing) Judging from the military intelligence received today in this area of the East Theater, a large number of well-trained and well-equipped Chinese troops have now arrived in the Shanghai area. There will be new developments in that area soon. These troops crossed the Japanese front lines, passing through Wujin, Changshu, and Taicang to reach their destination, and are now setting up positions in the suburbs of Shanghai. Other units of the Chinese army have also arrived in Baoshan, Jiading, and Qingpu. (1st, Reuters)

### Situation in Zhongshan Turns Mild Again

(Hong Kong) Shiqi telephone: The Japanese troops at Hengmen retreated to their ships last night in succession. The situation in Anjing and Zhongshan, Tangjiawan, has turned mild again. Li Hanhun ordered the dispatch of defense corps from Taishan and Kaiping to Zhongshan to assist in defending the territory. Macao reports that the Japanese troops' attempt to force Shiqi to land at Niushi Bay is inaccurate. To protect the waterways, the Zhongshan authorities have again blockaded the sea entrances at Jinzhong and Shenwan. Ferries and cargo ships traveling between Shiqi and the Siyi area are greatly affected. Navigation between Macao and Shiqi has also been rerouted. The Taikoo Foshan ship, originally scheduled to sail to Guangzhou on the 1st, suddenly changed its schedule. It is rumored that the Japanese troops will start inspecting Chinese in Shameen on the 2nd. (1st, Special Dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Reinforce Baotou

Wuyuan: The Japanese troops in Baotou, feeling threatened by the Chinese troops' gradual advance, dispatched 40 vehicles and several artillery pieces to Mazhizhen yesterday to reinforce the defense. The Chinese troops are still pursuing the Japanese troops. (31st, Telegram)

### Japanese Planes Attack Wuzhou

Guilin: Eighteen Japanese planes, taking off from Guangzhou Airport and passing through Wuzhou, invaded the city airspace at 1:30 PM this afternoon, dropping many bombs, killing and injuring several people, and destroying over ten houses before fleeing elsewhere. (31st, Telegram)

Yulin: Five Japanese planes flew over Songjiachuan, Suide, and other places on the 30th to spy. Two Japanese planes flew over Songjiachuan, Suide, Qingjian, and Yanchang on the morning of the 31st to spy and dropped bombs in Yongping Town. (31st, Telegram)

### Statistics of Japanese Troops Killed in the Second Half of July: Over 13,600; 350 Battles

(Chongqing) According to Chinese military intelligence today, a total of 13,694 Japanese troops were killed by Chinese troops in the second half of July, with a total of 350 battles. From Chahar through Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, there were a total of 101 battles, killing a total of 3,968 Japanese troops. In the Suiyuan and Shanxi areas, there were a total of 46 battles, killing a total of 3,138 Japanese troops.

### Chinese Diplomatic Observer Analyzes the International Situation: US Action of Abrogating Treaty Deals a Major Blow to Japan; Whether British Words Match Actions Remains to Be Seen

(Chongqing) A certain Chinese diplomatic observer here analyzed the international situation, which has a special relationship with the Sino-Japanese War, today, claiming that the US abrogation of the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Japan is tantamount to a clear indication to Britain that if Britain takes the same action, the US will not only protect British and American interests in the Far East but also shatter the Japanese dream of establishing a new order in East Asia. Now there are various reasons to hope that the British government will take a definite stand soon. At present, it is impossible to judge whether Britain's Far Eastern policy can change, but Britain has indeed made concessions to Japan. Whether Chamberlain and Halifax's words match their actions remains to be seen. The abrogation of the US-Japan commercial treaty has a huge spiritual impact on the Chinese side and a demoralizing impact on the Japanese people, which is undeniable. Although the abrogation will only take effect after six months, Japan's import and export trade with the US will inevitably suffer a setback due to the hesitation of American import and export merchants.

Yunnan will definitely not be able to accommodate 100,000 Jews. The opinion of Chinese government officials is that China can only accept a certain number of technical personnel, such as engineers and doctors, as this type of personnel is needed by China.

### British and American Properties in Chongqing are Mostly Concentrated Bombing Points for Japanese Aircraft: Chinese Anti-Aircraft Artillery Shows Great Power; Ferry Terminal is the Only Area Bombed

(Chongqing) Two teams of Japanese planes bombed Chongqing last night, concentrating their bombing on many British and American properties on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Japanese bombs concentrated on the old anchorage of the British warship "Falcon." The British warship was damaged in a recent Japanese bombing of Chongqing. The searchlights of the Chinese air defense forces discovered the tracks of the first team of Japanese planes at 9:30 PM, from east to west. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units showed great power, and the Japanese planes' formations were disrupted by the anti-aircraft artillery shells. However, no Japanese planes were shot down. With the help of the bright moon, the Japanese planes flew very smoothly. Conversely, the anti-aircraft artillery units, without dense clouds, also easily found their targets. The second team of Japanese planes was discovered at 10:40 PM, but did not fly over Chongqing, only dropping bombs on the opposite bank of the Yangtze River. The ferry terminal was the only area bombed during both bombings. (1st, Associated Press)

(Chongqing) It is claimed that four Japanese planes were shot down by Chinese planes and anti-aircraft artillery, but Reuters reporters, after inquiring at the Air Force Headquarters and the Air Defense Department, were unable to confirm this claim. The above-mentioned two agencies are currently conducting an investigation. (1st, Reuters)

(Chongqing) Eighteen Japanese bombers, divided into two teams, attacked Chongqing last night under the moonlight. The two teams dropped bombs in the same area, namely part of the city and part of the south bank of the Yangtze River. The first team of Japanese planes arrived at 9:30 PM, and the second team arrived an hour later. Both encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire, and Chinese fighter planes rose to intercept them. No fires broke out in any location. The air raid alarm was lifted at 11:20 PM. After the Japanese planes left, Reuters reporters went to the bombed area and found that both banks of the Yangtze River were almost unscathed, as most of the bombs fell into the river. A civilian ship was directly hit by a bomb and blown to smithereens. Two bombs fell on Xiachengdou Road near the riverbank but did not explode. When Reuters reporters arrived on the scene, police and military police cordoned off the road with ropes, preventing traffic for fear of explosion. A red light marked the point where the bomb landed. Several bombs fell on the riverbank, but there were very few casualties. Reuters reporters saw a person lying stiffly on the side of the road outside the entrance to an air-raid shelter, about half a mile from where the bombs fell, apparently killed by machine-gun fire. The results of the air combat are not yet known. (1st, Reuters) Chongqing: After a week of no harassment from Japanese planes due to bad weather, with strong winds and heavy rain, the weather improved last night, and Japanese planes launched another large-scale night raid on Chongqing. The first air raid alarm was issued at 8:30 PM, and citizens flocked to air-raid shelters to take cover. The first emergency alarm was issued at 9:00 PM, and the second emergency alarm was issued at 9:15 PM. The first batch of Japanese planes, totaling nine, invaded the city airspace and dropped many bombs in the south of the city. Half an hour later, the second batch of 15 planes arrived again and indiscriminately dropped bombs in the city and suburbs. The alarm was lifted at 11:00 PM. The extent of the damage has not yet been ascertained. (1st, Haitian News Agency)

### Chamberlain Reiterates Sincerity in Negotiations with the Soviets; Disagreement Remains Only on Definition of "Indirect Aggression"; British and French Military Representatives Depart Tomorrow

(London) According to reliable sources, the British military delegation is scheduled to leave for Paris on August 2nd, and the next day, together with the French military delegation, they will proceed to Moscow to hold talks with the Soviet General Staff. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, during today's foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, declared that the British government's decision to send a military delegation to Moscow, beginning military discussions before a political agreement is reached, is almost unprecedented in history. We agree to send representatives of the army, navy, and air force to the Soviet Union, and to discuss together how we can make our military plans correspond before we obtain a guarantee of a political agreement. This truly demonstrates the greatest trust and a genuine, intense desire to achieve a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations. The Prime Minister also said in his remarks that Britain's defenses are now remarkably strong. The main obstacle to a prompt conclusion to the Moscow talks is the failure to agree on a satisfactory definition of the term "indirect aggression." The situation in Danzig remains serious and requires attention.

Questions from Members of Parliament

Today's debate was initiated by Liberal opposition leader Sinclair, who referred to Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's recent speech in which he said, "Our current task is to resist aggression." Sinclair continued, "The leaders appointed by both opposition parties agree with this statement in equally clear, frank, and truthful terms. However, Chamberlain has not yet expressed this sentiment." (Loud shouts of "Hear, hear!" from the Conservative Party). "I must frankly state that the public has the impression that the Prime Minister's intention is still appeasement, and that his resistance to aggression is not as firm as Lord Halifax's. We urgently need new guarantees for the negotiations with the Soviet Union. The House should not adjourn now, or for an extended period, until these negotiations are concluded. The government should inform the House of the detailed progress of the negotiations as soon as possible to reassure the public. Judging from the speeches of Stalin and other Soviet politicians, and the various resolutions passed by government agencies, the Soviet Union believes that the conclusion of an agreement is beneficial to the Soviet people. Therefore, we must dispel mutual suspicions and form an alliance with the Soviet Union. To express friendship and respect, we should send someone of the highest reputation and political standing in our country, who can approach the most influential authorities in the Soviet Union, to Moscow. The events in Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Danzig all demonstrate the absolute necessity of finding a practical definition for the term "indirect aggression." The government's decision to seek recognition for the British consul in Prague, regardless of whether it de facto recognizes Germany's control over Czechoslovakia, is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, the government remains steadfast in its view and has not softened its position on Germany's demand for legal recognition of the annexation of Czechoslovakia. The situation in Czechoslovakia is very tense, and a spark there could easily ignite a prairie fire throughout Europe. As for the Danzig issue, if we want to maintain peace and stop aggression now, the government must inform the House and Germany at what point the line between peace and war will be drawn. Sinclair continued, if Hungary is unjustifiably provoked and becomes a victim of aggression, the Hungarian government is determined to defend its independence. All members of the peace front should clearly state that if other countries are willing to unite in this common interest, even Germany and Italy can do so. This would place the responsibility of encirclement on Germany's shoulders, as Lord Halifax intended. If Germany joins this circle on a completely equal footing, with disarmament, subject to the rule of law, and to the judgment of a third party, then Germany can break this encirclement at any time."

Labor MP Dalton declared that the opposition strongly opposes the House adjourning for an extended period with restrictions. Dalton continued to criticize the prolonged negotiations with the Soviet Union and Poland and mentioned the military talks, hoping that the members of the delegation could openly and honestly discuss matters, setting a good example for politicians. The right course today is for Lord Halifax to personally meet with Molotov, or invite Molotov to meet with him, and for Chamberlain and Stalin to exchange views, which would be admirable. If Hitler knows for sure that an alliance has been formed with Britain and France, then he will not dare to invade, at least not this year or in the near future.

Prime Minister's Reply

The Prime Minister rose to speak amid cheers, stating that he is currently in a position to guide several negotiations with foreign countries, some of which are of a delicate nature. He felt that at this moment, he should think carefully before speaking. The Prime Minister said, regarding the statement that "the Prime Minister is weaker than the Foreign Secretary," he wishes he could say one more word that would please the lurking enemies even more; otherwise, this is a malicious attempt to sow seeds of suspicion in the minds of Britain's allies. The work of handling diplomatic negotiations is not easy. He believes that those who have held responsible positions in the past and still hope to do so in the future, if they have any regard for what is appropriate and what is likely to benefit the overall situation, should ask themselves whether their conscience is clear before speaking on this matter. Since March of this year, the government has used the time to rearm, and Britain's defenses are now indeed of a great and astonishing nature. Britain, together with France, Poland, and Turkey, is consulting to build a peace front, which is of great importance. Britain will give guarantees to Romania and Greece, telling them that they are not without friends and that they are not without those who recognize that they may be the targets of attacks. If those countries are indeed attacked, then we will come to their aid. The Prime Minister continued, MP Dalton takes pride in insisting on questioning the progress of the British-Soviet negotiations. In fact, he has long been trying to blame the government for the delay in negotiations. If I restrain myself from saying this, it is precisely because I sincerely hope for a compromise. I dare to assure the House that correcting the wrong impression made by Dalton requires some self-restraint. Therefore, I intend to briefly describe the progress of the negotiations today. I am well aware that the people of other countries are watching the negotiations with envy. If they could use any tool to alienate the Soviet Union from us, they would be extremely happy. I do not want to provide them with exploitable information (Applause). The fact that the Soviet, French, and British governments have so far failed to agree on a definition of "indirect aggression" that satisfies all parties cannot be hidden. However, all three countries now know that the danger of indirect aggression is just as great as direct aggression, and all three countries are willing to find a satisfactory way to jointly resist it. At the same time, we are extremely keen to avoid any appearance of infringing on the independence of other countries. If we have not yet reached agreement with the Soviet Union on the definition of the term "indirect aggression," it is because the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, in our view, appear to have this kind of implication. Regarding the interim agreement, the Soviet Union insists that it be signed after the entire agreement is completed, and not signed in advance. The government's decision to send a military delegation to Moscow was based on the Soviet Foreign Minister's expression of opinion that once military talks begin, the political difficulties will not be insurmountable. Therefore, he attaches great importance to these military talks, which is an indication of how we are perceived. We hope that Molotov's expectations will be realized.

The Prime Minister next mentioned the Danzig issue, saying that the situation there continues to cause great public concern and requires careful attention. Although several border disputes have occurred, the Polish government has shown commendable restraint. Therefore, it can now be concluded that the Polish government will continue its wise and statesmanlike self-restraint. Everyone must recognize that a situation in which weapons of war continue to accumulate on all sides must be given serious attention, for if it is not resolved by war itself, it is difficult to find a way to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, countries are being incited by poisonous propaganda and harbor negative emotions towards each other. He believes that if this war of words can be ended and actions taken to restore confidence in peace among the countries of Europe, then all issues can be resolved through peaceful discussion. If this can be done, the gains for all parties involved will be immeasurable, and it can lead to an unprecedented era of prosperity for international agricultural and industrial enterprises, resulting in an improvement in the general condition of the world's people. On the other hand, if war unfortunately breaks out, then no matter who ultimately wins, both the victor and the vanquished will inevitably suffer painful lessons. He firmly believes that these great, profound, and fundamental truths have begun to permeate the minds of rulers and peoples alike. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

### Economic War Between Poland and Danzig

Danzig: The Danzig situation, which had been calm for some time, has recently become turbulent again. It is reported that the Polish Commissioner for Danzig, Chodacki, suddenly returned from his vacation to deal with the severe trade war between Danzig and Poland. Recently, the Polish people have threatened that if Polish inspectors are not given preferential treatment in the Danzig butter factory, the Polish authorities will withdraw them. Poland has now refused to buy butter from the factory again. However, the Danzig Senate has threatened that if this decision is not reconsidered, Danzig will wage an "extensive economic war" against Poland. At the same time, German newspapers in Berlin and the German news agency claim that Poland's restrictions on the import of certain goods into Danzig are undermining the Polish-Danzig economic agreement. Reports from Poznan state that German-speaking residents there are being abused and imprisoned. The leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Forster, is vacationing with another Danzig leader, Zieschke, in Forster's hometown of Forster. Afterward, the two will go to Salzburg to meet with Hitler again to discuss major plans for the autumn. Observers here predict that there will be no major developments in Danzig until then. Many workers arrested in the recent anti-communist movement in Danzig have reportedly been transferred to Berlin. Several of them have been executed as political prisoners. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

Warsaw: After the Polish government decided to take economic sanctions against the Free City of Danzig, the City Senate has also decided that all Polish customs officials in the city's customs must be appointed by the City Senate, and those who have not been appointed will be treated as "border" officials. In addition, it is reported that other economic retaliatory measures will be taken. The proposal to open the border between Danzig and the German province of East Prussia has not been mentioned. Government officials in Poland commented that the right to appoint and remove Danzig customs officials rests with the Polish state, and that the City Senate's actions are arbitrary and unacceptable to the Polish state. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)

Danzig: It is claimed here that Polish customs officials are engaged in espionage activities of all kinds, and that the number of inspectors has increased from 27 in 1929 to 100 today, which is in complete violation of the 1920 Paris Agreement. (Haitong Dispatch, 22nd)

Danzig: Well-informed sources here believe that the correspondence between the Danzig Senate and the Polish diplomatic representative is of the utmost importance. The main issue in the letter is Poland's ban on Danzig products entering the country. A semi-official Danzig newspaper published an article stating that if Poland wants to terminate customs and trade cooperation, then the Danzig government will have no choice but to sign new trade agreements with other neighboring countries.

### Europe Like a Huge Barracks; British Fleet Concentrated for Exercises; German and Italian Armies Conduct Separate Large-Scale Maneuvers

(London) Thirteen thousand naval reservists have arrived separately at the naval bases in Portsmouth, Gaza, Devonport, and Gosport. One hundred and thirty-three service ships will be inspected by the King at Weymouth Port before participating in naval exercises until the end of September. The cruiser "Effingham" and the 23,000-ton aircraft carrier "Courageous" are also among them. In addition, the ships belonging to the British Home Fleet have left Portsmouth for Loch Ewe and Invergordon in northern Scotland in preparation for participating in the exercises. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)

(Berlin) The German army will begin large-scale maneuvers, the first in many years. Passenger planes will be banned from flying over a large area of northwestern Germany for 48 hours starting today to allow for military aircraft maneuvers during that time. Although the details of the maneuvers have not yet been announced, the restricted area is 1,500 square miles, and the scale can be imagined. After the air force exercises, they will be followed by mechanized units. These units are currently stationed in various parts of southwestern Germany, such as Silesia, Sudetenland, Bohemia, and Moravia. Their exercise range extends to the Polish border. New German recruits have been conscripted at the beginning of August, and private cars in many places have been requisitioned. The supply of gasoline for civilian use is now gradually becoming scarce. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

(Rome) Italian troops will now conduct maneuvers in the Po River region, which will be held at the same time as the German air force exercises. German Chief of Staff Halder and Hungarian Chief of Staff Wert will both come to observe. Approximately 50,000 troops will participate in the maneuvers, and their hypothetical enemy is from the French border. The exercise area is 220 miles long and 45 miles wide. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

Taranto: According to a communiqué issued here today, Italian naval exercises were held in the Mediterranean Sea from July 24th to 30th, which were of great significance. All kinds of warships and submarines, as well as a large part of the air force, participated. During the final meeting of senior officers, the leader of the German delegation, Admiral Grossmann, and other senior officers from that country, as well as the leader of the Spanish delegation, Commander Rigletto, also attended the meeting. It is said that these exercises can collect a large amount of valuable information. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

### 25th Anniversary of the Outbreak of the European War; Germany and the Soviet Union Prepare to Commemorate

(Berlin) Two million German soldiers will hold a commemoration tomorrow marking the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the European War. Victory parades will be held throughout Germany at that time. When Kaiser Wilhelm II issued a general mobilization order on August 2, 1914, and attacked the Russian army, the number of German regular troops was less than 700,000. Today, under the rule of Chancellor Hitler's "Third Reich," there are one million regular troops, including reservists, for a total of 1.8 million. By the end of this month, the number of armed German soldiers will reach two million. Chancellor Hitler, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, has ordered the German army to hold parades and ceremonies in various places. On Wednesday, the entire day, all barracks will fly the national flag, and concerts will be held in the defense zones in the evening. Although the number of German troops today is more than double what it was when the Kaiser participated in the Great War, foreign military experts here believe that this cannot be used as a standard for comparing the strength of the German armies. In 1914, Germany had 19 classes of reservists, with a total of approximately 7.6 million trained soldiers. Today, Germany has only three classes of reservists who have received military training, with approximately one million people, in addition to the regular troops who have received full and partial training. (Associated Press Dispatch, 1st)

(Moscow) Today, Soviet newspapers mostly carried articles commemorating the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the First Imperialist War. An editorial in Pravda stated, "The Second Imperialist War has now followed the First, and the war has already been waged in various parts of the world, with a great tendency to engulf the entire globe. The powerful Soviet Union has always been committed to defending peace, and those who provoke it will shatter their defenses before our country's border barriers. The Japanese militarists have already learned this lesson. The Battle of Lake Khasan has proven the solidity of Soviet national defense. The Soviet Union does not need the territory of other countries and expresses its utmost sympathy for the just resistance of other peoples and faithfully fulfills its obligations to guarantee their freedom. Therefore, the Soviet people are thoroughly implementing the Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Assistance Treaty, defending the borders and territory of the Mongolian People's Republic as if they were their own. The Soviet Union is watching the sinister games of the fascist warmongers with a calm attitude, but this calmness is different from the cowardice of the bourgeois isolationists who hide behind flimsy armor and dare not face the calamities of war. The Soviet people know that only a strong common front of peace-loving countries can stop the expansionist policies of the fascist aggressors, and only a determined and strong force is sufficient to restrain the mad aggressors. The Soviet Union's peace policy is this kind of force. We are not afraid of war and are accustomed to fighting for justice. The unity of the Soviet people and their faithful support for the government and the Leninist-Stalinist party have made the Red Army and Navy invincible. The Red Army's absolute superiority over the fascist armies is obvious." (TASS Dispatch, 1st)

Well-informed sources say that the date of the elections will be November 16th or 13th. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)

(London) Both the House of Lords and the House of Commons are scheduled to adjourn within days. According to past practice, most cabinet ministers will go abroad to spend part of their summer vacation during the summer recess. This year, except for Minister of Health Elliot, who will spend two weeks on the French Riviera in southern France, other cabinet ministers will spend their summer in their villas within the country, so that they can quickly return to Beijing if necessary. Minister for Coordination of Defence, Admiral Chatfield, will remain in Beijing until August 11th, in order to direct the blackout exercises on that day. First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, will go to his villa in Kent to rest, or go to the Scottish coast to inspect the ships belonging to the Home Fleet. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax plans to spend time at his villa in Yorkshire. Where Prime Minister Chamberlain will go is unknown, but it can be said with certainty that he will maintain contact with Beijing. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)

### Anti-British Movement Spreads Throughout Japan; Cabinet Met Yesterday Morning to Discuss Maintaining Domestic Order

(Tokyo) This morning, Foreign Minister Arita reported to the Cabinet on the reasons for the United States' abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and on the domestic situation in the United States. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Home Minister Kido and the Prime Minister secretly discussed maintaining domestic peace and order, as the anti-British movement is now spreading throughout the country.

At the rally, a strongly worded anti-British resolution was passed. Anti-British rallies are also reported to have been held in Hakodate and other places. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

### Spain Does Not Forget Gibraltar

Burgos: Today is the 235th anniversary of Spain's cession of the port of Gibraltar to Britain.

August 1, 1704, is a day of national humiliation that the Spanish people should remember. Today, all our people have great trust in the leader, General Franco, and the future is immeasurable."

### Sassoon Praises the US Abrogation of the Japan Treaty, Saying Anglo-American-French Cooperation Can Mortally Wound Japan

(New York) Sir Victor Sassoon, a prominent wealthy businessman from Shanghai, told reporters here yesterday that "Japan is now coveting the lands of white people, so it is not satisfied with occupying North China. However, if the British, French, and American authorities can cooperate with each other, they can undoubtedly 'cut off Japan's throat'." He also said that the Japanese will inevitably exert pressure on South America in the future. Therefore, the United States' abrogation of the treaty with Japan is a measure to prevent future troubles. "In the future, the British government may take similar actions. As for the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, the results may not satisfy the Japanese military." (Meiwen News Agency Dispatch, 1st)

### Widespread Support for US Abrogation of Treaty with Japan

(Hong Kong) The United States government resolutely announced the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which was unanimously supported by major American newspapers, which considered it an inevitable and logical response to Japan's repeated infringement of American rights and interests in China. It is believed that the vast American public supports this action as a preliminary step to satisfy the growing demand for a boycott of Japanese goods. It is generally expected that the Japanese militarists will further aggravate the situation, and that by January next year, the US Congress will fully agree to a boycott of Japanese goods. The "New York Daily News" stated that the abrogation of the treaty is not a thorough solution and that a comprehensive strategy should be adopted, with the British and American navies using Singapore, Hawaii, and the Aleutian Islands as bases to implement a long-range blockade against Japan. The "New York Times" stated that the United States' announcement of the abrogation of the treaty at a time of serious crisis is the greatest possible pressure. It should not merely provide China with a little encouragement during a dark period. If Britain adopts a tough policy, it will not be isolated, and it warned Japan that the United States, adhering strictly to its treaty commitments, will take all peaceful means to ensure China's independence and integrity. The vast majority of the American people firmly support the government's actions. The "New York Tribune" stated that the position of the Japanese militarists will become increasingly dangerous. The "Washington Post" stated that this action by the US Executive Branch has made it clear to all countries, "including Japan," that the US government has a broad range of freedom in its foreign policy. The Philadelphia newspaper stated that the abrogation of the treaty is a step towards humanitarian goals and is sufficient to stop Japan's brutal acts of aggression, which is commendable. The "St. Louis Express" stated that the abrogation of the treaty is sufficient to restore some of Britain's failure. The "Los Angeles Times" stated that the abrogation of the treaty is an expression of ending useless paper documents and shows that Americans will not allow the situation to continue to be prolonged. French and Belgian newspapers also enthusiastically supported the US abrogation of the treaty. The French right-wing newspapers lamented that the US action was too late to prevent Britain from yielding to Japan. The right-wing "Humanité" stated that Britain and France yielded because they cited the unclear attitudes of the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet Union's tough stance towards Japan can be seen in the border war with "Manchukuo". (31st Dispatch)

### An Unprecedentedly Busy Customs House: Export Goods Pile Up Like Mountains, Import of Foreign Goods Declines, Prospects are Bleak. The National Government's Effort to Balance Trade Has Achieved Significant Results. Small Machines Shift Internally

The "China Mail" reports that the Jianghai Customs officers were extremely busy yesterday (the 31st), the busiest they have been in many years. They issued customs clearance documents to many exporters, mostly foreign firms shipping goods to the interior and overseas. From dawn until late at night, the Bund was unusually active. This situation is rarely seen even in this commercially thriving part of the city. Hundreds of tons of goods, packed in wooden crates or parcels, were piled up along the Bund from the Customs House to the War Memorial, waiting to be loaded onto various cargo ships leaving Shanghai this week.

Exporting Firms

Were busy all day, loading goods onto ships leaving port in the next few days, such as the "Cuff," "Marshal Joffre," and the "President Coolidge," which was being loaded today. According to investigations, the majority of goods piled up along the riverfront are being shipped to countries such as Britain and America. Customs officials claim that while there are quite a few

Colored Cotton Cloths

The majority of the goods are foodstuffs. There are also quite a few boxed mirrors and other glassware, and matches. Several small machines are waiting to be shipped, to be transported south along the coast

To the interior. According to a representative of a foreign export firm in this city, his firm's export business

To foreign countries

Has never been as busy as it was yesterday. Goods piled up all morning, and only began to decrease in the afternoon, indicating that many exporters had obtained customs clearance documents and were arranging to load their goods onto ships. At the same time, the volume of exports dwarfed the volume of imports. This is the first clear example of this in several months. Many believe that the

Trade Trend

Will continue like this in the coming months. Some Chinese attribute yesterday's thriving exports to the central government's efforts to balance international trade, reduce imports, and adapt to wartime conditions. The government has also strictly prohibited the import of various "enemy goods" into the interior from Shanghai. However, merchants in this city insist that Shanghai's export firms are taking advantage of the low exchange rate to buy goods cheaply and ship them abroad. Now that the value of the legal tender has been lowered, it is not surprising that imports have decreased. It is predicted that imports will continue to decline in the future.

### North Jiangxi Road: The Situation Eases; Residents Continue to Move Out, But Entry and Exit Are Relatively Free

North Jiangxi Road, from the northern end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south to the eastern end of Old Baizi Road in the north, including shops, residences, and alleyways, suddenly became tense after the Japanese erected barriers of wooden poles and barbed wire on the 29th of last month. A Datong News Agency reporter revisited the road yesterday morning and found that the

Gaps in the Barricade

Were located at the Chongming Road intersection, the Wenjianshi Road intersection, and the Haining Road intersection. The gap at the Chongming Road intersection is used by residents traveling to and from the Hongkou area, who must present passes, pass through Japanese soldiers' posts, and bow respectfully before being allowed to pass. The gaps at the Wenjianshi Road and Haining Road intersections

Allow Residents To Come and Go Freely.

Therefore, although Japanese soldiers guard the inner perimeter of the barbed wire, residents entering and exiting do not need to bow or present passes. However, the Japanese are apparently giving the shops and residences in the blockaded area a period of hesitation in recent days, allowing them to choose whether to stay or leave. Those who

Choose To Leave

Are allowed to move. Those who choose to stay must first get a preventative shot at the street-level disease prevention office in the eastern section of North Jiangxi Road, which is in the newly blockaded area, and then obtain a pass with the vaccination certificate. Only then will they be qualified to reside there. However, based on what the Datong News Agency reporter observed, very few people seem willing to stay in the newly blockaded area. The street is full of moving trucks, and

Shops are Hastening To Sell

Goods and sundries. Homes are hurrying to move furniture and luggage to the central area of the concession, a clear indication that they are eager to avoid the situation. However, one noteworthy point observed yesterday morning was that the number of Japanese soldiers guarding the barbed wire barriers has greatly decreased. While Japanese soldiers are still stationed as inner guards at the gaps, the outer guards have been replaced by Chinese police, so the tense atmosphere has eased considerably.

### Busy Departure: Admiral Yarnell Returned Home Yesterday; Large Ship Scheduled to Sail to America This Morning; General Hat Scheduled to Tour the North Today

According to the English-language "China Press," former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, and his wife are scheduled to leave their residence at the Cathay Apartments at 5:00 p.m. today (the 1st), go to the Customs Wharf, and board the "President Coolidge" to return to America. Two squads of French Concession police

Formed an Honor Guard

In front of the Cathay Apartments to show respect. After Admiral Yarnell and his wife inspected the French police honor guard in front of their residence, they traveled by car, accompanied by a motorcade of the Public Concession Police and the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, via Jing'an Temple and Nanjing Road to the Customs Wharf. A squad of U.S. Marines and a band were stationed at the Customs Wharf to offer

Farewell Greetings

To Admiral Yarnell. Several groups of American expatriates in Shanghai, such as the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Community Federation, sent delegations to the Customs Wharf to bid farewell. It is expected that General Hart and his wife will also be present to bid farewell to their predecessor. The "President Coolidge" is scheduled to set sail for America at approximately 11:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 2nd). After Admiral Yarnell arrives in America, he will

Go to Washington

To report to the Chief of Naval Operations before potentially retiring. The U.S. Congress is currently considering awarding Admiral Yarnell the U.S. Medal of Honor. Furthermore, according to the "China Mail," after bidding farewell to the outgoing Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, General Hart, is scheduled to travel to Qingdao aboard the U.S. warship "Augusta" at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow (the 2nd). This voyage is

The First Voyage

Under the new Commander-in-Chief, to sail to North China to join the rest of the Asiatic Fleet for summer exercises. General Hart's wife and two daughters are scheduled to leave Shanghai aboard the "Dalian Maru" tomorrow morning and will meet General Hart in Qingdao. The U.S. transport ship "Gold Star" has been berthed in Shanghai for a week and is scheduled to sail to Japan at 9:30 a.m. today (the 1st). The "Gold Star's" domestic base is Guam in the Pacific Ocean, and it

Sails North Annually

Three times a year to purchase food and other goods and supply the residents of the island. This time, it arrived in Shanghai at the end of its voyage north, carrying several officers and soldiers stationed in Guam and their families, who toured the north for a week to temporarily escape the heat of the tropical island.

### Japanese Puppet Authorities Promote "Huaxing" Counterfeit Currency; Rumor That Customs Authorities Are Considering It; Puppet "Renovation Government" Forces Its Use

According to the "New Voice News Agency," after the fall of Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs was the first target of the "Renovation Government," which seized all tax revenues, forced them to be deposited into the Zhengjin Bank, and forced the Jianghai Customs to fly the five-colored flag on its roof. It was previously rumored that the "Renovation Government" ordered the Jianghai Customs to collect "Huaxing banknotes" for tax revenues within the Japanese-controlled areas. It is rumored that the Jianghai Customs authorities are currently considering this. It is also said that the Jianghai Customs has not received such an order.

Japanese Employees Paid With Counterfeit Currency

According to the "Continental Daily," the Japanese authorities have decided to promote the circulation of "Huaxing Commercial Bank" banknotes in this city. This can be inferred from reliable sources. Broadway Mansion announced at the end of last month that it would require rent to be paid in the new counterfeit currency from September 1st. It is also said that Japanese trading firms will allow all employees, especially Chinese employees, to be paid with this "Hongkou currency" soon.

Forced Use in the Central China Area

It is also said that all factories and other commercial establishments in the "Great Way" area will be requested to use this currency to pay their employees. Yesterday (the 31st), Reuters reported from Tokyo that "semi-official Japanese sources in Nanjing" claimed that all taxes and customs duties in Central China would be required to be paid in the new "Huaxing currency" in the future. The "Renovation Government," which controls the new bank, has issued this order.

Mellor's Statement: No News

When the reporter asked Jianghai Customs Commissioner Mellor about this matter yesterday, he replied, "All I can say is that I have no official news." Yesterday, when Japanese officials hosted a press conference, reporters asked about the Tokyo news mentioned above. The spokesperson replied that the Chinese Customs authorities and the "Renovation Government" were "studying ways to collect customs duties in a currency that is slightly more stable than the legal tender." The matter is still under study. According to the "China Mail," just after 9:00 p.m. on Sunday night, a patrol team from the Pudong Road Police Station ordered two Chinese men to stop on Robert Yinghua Alley (transliterated). However, the two men refused to be searched, claiming that they were detectives from the "Great Way" Police Bureau. However, the police officers leading the patrol team pointed out that they were stopped within the Public Concession. The two sides were at odds, and a crowd of Chinese onlookers gathered. After a long time, it was decided to take the two men to the police station for verification. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday (the 30th), evidence was obtained proving that the two men were indeed employed by the "Great Way" Police Bureau, and they were released. The police station is taking this matter seriously because "Great Way" police officers have no right to enter the Public Concession.

### Foreigners Escaping the Summer Heat in Qingdao Bitterly Describe Their Ordeals; Japanese Women Search British Women and Seize Legal Tender; Total Amount Seized On One Ship Estimated at 5,000 Yuan

According to the English-language "China Press," foreigners returning to Shanghai after escaping the summer heat in Qingdao and the Japanese authorities in Qingdao are strictly searching departing passengers, including foreigners traveling to escape the summer heat, and seizing any legal tender found. The searches of British passengers are particularly strict, but foreigners of other nationalities are not exempt. The Japanese who conduct searches on departing ships treat passengers like prisoners. A foreign woman from Shanghai who returned from Qingdao on the "Dalian Maru"

Said that

She was led into an empty cabin by a Japanese searcher and subjected to a thorough search. Although she was not stripped naked, she was forced to lift her underwear, and several hundred yuan of legal tender hidden inside were immediately seized. She was given a receipt. She even wanted to keep two yuan for a taxi fare, but was not allowed to. When passengers boarded the ship on Sunday,

The Examiners Were Arranged on the Deck

There were no fewer than seven examiners, and one Japanese woman stood at the other end. Passengers were searched without exception as they passed. The Shanghai foreign woman was carrying a small suitcase, which was searched one by one by seven examiners. When they opened her handbag, which contained Federal Reserve notes, they were not confiscated. When she reached the other end, the Japanese woman examiner stopped her, groped her body, and asked the foreign woman to step out of the line.

And Lift Her Underwear. The foreign woman protested. The Japanese woman consulted with other examiners, led her into an empty cabin, conducted a more thorough search, and confiscated the legal tender that was found. According to the foreign woman's estimate, no less than 5,000 yuan of legal tender was seized on the ship that day. Passengers had received notice before boarding that legal tender was not allowed to be brought back to Shanghai. Some British passengers were searched as many as four times before the examiners.

### Pharmaceutical Industry Peers Reorganize Business Rules; Set Dates for Silver Exchange in This City and Other Ports; All Businesses to Operate as Usual From Today

The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Guild's affiliated trade groups are reorganizing business rules in order to maintain peer operations. They suspended business for three days starting on the 29th of last month. It is now learned that all peers in the industry have revised their business rules as follows: (1) Silver Exchange Period: Within this city, silver exchange is stipulated to occur twice a month, i.e., from the 1st to the 15th of each month, exchange is to be completed with 20-day promissory notes; from the 16th to the end of the month, exchange is to be completed with 5-day promissory notes for the following month. (2) Other Ports: Regardless of face-to-face consultation or written orders, silver must be paid before goods are delivered. (3) Customer's Helper Weighing: After the transaction is completed, weighing must be completed within three days. If the deadline is exceeded, the business will weigh on behalf of the customer, send the invoice for stamping, and silver must be exchanged on time. If there is a delay, the customer will be responsible for any accidents. The above rules have been unanimously approved by the industry and will be implemented from August 1st. All businesses have resumed normal operations today.

### The French Concession Newspaper District: Precautions Become Increasingly Thorough; Opening and Closing of the Grain Exchange is Restricted; Terrorists Cannot Act

Since the attack on the Zhongmei Ribao and Da Wanbao newspapers, the French Concession authorities, because the Da Mei newspaper is located in the French Concession area at No. 19 Edward Road, the police authorities, fearing accidents, have implemented strict precautions in the area where the newspaper is located. Four small armored vehicles have been stationed day and night from the Bund to the Zhubao San Road intersection, and armed French troops, as well as Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives, are patrolling back and forth. In addition, plainclothes detectives are inspecting suspicious pedestrians at any time in the Huangpu Beach Road Catholic Church Street area.

Opening and Closing of the Grain Exchange is Restricted

Because the Grain Exchange at No. 15 Edward Road is next door to the Da Mei newspaper and the exchange is a commercial market, the situation is very complicated. The Laobeimen Maixie Police Station in the French Concession fears that lawless elements will mix among them and attempt to disrupt public order. Therefore, it notified the exchange the other day to stipulate business hours: the door opens at 8:00 a.m. every day, closes at 11:45 a.m., opens at 1:30 p.m., and closes at 6:00 p.m. The keys to the iron gate are taken away by the police detectives on duty and then the doors are locked. No one is allowed to enter or leave. Now that the exchange has received this notice, it has announced it to the market and issued entry cards for identification purposes, otherwise entry is not allowed.

Exchange Staff's Family Members and Others Request Understanding and Change

Approximately one hundred members of the Shanghai Grain Exchange and their family members stayed in the exchange after the "August 13th" incident. Now that the French Concession police authorities have suddenly implemented emergency precautionary measures at the exchange, causing panic among all the staff members and their families living there. They specifically requested the police authorities and the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association today to change the opening and closing times from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. every morning, with no closure at noon, and further requested that each member of the exchange board be issued an entry and exit permit.

The French Police Station is Doing Its Utmost to Protect the Newspaper District

One day, the French newspaper Shanghai Ribao said that yesterday morning, some people passing by Edward Road suspected that a new incident had occurred there, because two automatic gun vehicles were deployed in the Da Mei Wanbao newspaper area near Catholic Church Street, and two Western police officers each held light machine guns and patrolled non-stop, while in the middle of the road, both Chinese and Western police officers had pistols to check pedestrians. On the sidewalk opposite the Da Mei Wanbao, there were two small bunkers, each guarded by one Chinese police officer. It is said that this strict precaution is because of the radicalism of the intimidation movement, and the police station is doing its utmost to protect the Da Mei Wanbao, because the newspaper has received many threatening letters, and the confession of the thugs arrested ten days ago has revealed a large-scale conspiracy. Although newspapers in other places may be subjected to new attacks, in the Da Mei Wanbao in the French Concession, terrorists cannot act. Moreover, it is said that the precautions of the French police station are not limited to the French Concession, and its patrolmen can also reach the other side of the Public Concession, and the Public Concession patrolmen are the same. This shows the practical cooperation between the two concession authorities, and although there are many bandits, it is feared that it will be difficult to take action. We still remember that when the Da Wanbao was attacked by bandits the previous week, the French Concession was the first to respond with gunfire, and the firepower was also fiercer from the French Concession.

The French Police Station Searched Wanyi Fang Yesterday Morning

At 5:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the French Concession Police Department dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in several police vehicles to surround Wanyi Fang on Luban Road, and then searched door to door. The search lasted for one hour. As a result, nothing was found.

### Haitan Sailing to Fuzhou Accidentally Touches Japanese Underwater Mine; Fortunately, Emergency Methods Were Used to Return to Hong Kong; Ships Sailing to Shacheng Are Obstructed From Unloading

The British-owned Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Haitan ship sailed from Hong Kong to Fuzhou on July 25th. At about 8:00 p.m. on the 26th, when it sailed north of Xiamen, near the sea off Fuzhou, it accidentally touched a Japanese naval mine blocking the Fuzhou port. The No. 1 cabin was broken. Fortunately, the shipowner managed to seal the broken area with emergency methods and had to return to Hong Kong. It arrived safely in Hong Kong the other day. It is reported that the mine was touched at 120 degrees east longitude and 26 degrees north latitude, that is, outside the mouth of the Minjiang River.

Shenguang Sailing to Wenzhou Has Already Returned

The routes of ships owned by the British Yilong Company have always been Wenzhou, Xinghua, Quanzhou, Shacheng, and Fuzhou. Since the ports along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian have been blockaded by Japanese warships, they have been forced to temporarily anchor and suspend sailing. The other day, the Shenguang ship was sent from Shanghai with an empty ship to test the Wenzhou route. When it reached the mouth of Wenzhou, it could not enter because Japanese warships had placed underwater mines outside the mouth of the Oujiang River. It returned to Shanghai. According to the Shanghai company's news yesterday, the ship will arrive in Shanghai in about three days, so the resumption of navigation to Wenzhou is difficult to achieve in the short term.

Ninghai Arrives in Hong Kong, Shacheng Suspends Navigation

Since Japanese warships obstructed navigation on the Fujian Shacheng route, the British-owned Lihe Foreign Firm's Haifu ship was obstructed from unloading when it arrived outside the mouth of Shacheng. Therefore, the plan to sail from Shanghai to Shacheng was terminated. The British-owned Taikoo Company's Ninghai ship sailed from Shacheng to Hong Kong. It was rumored that it was detained by Japanese warships in the Fujian waters. It has now been confirmed that the ship was questioned by Japanese warships using flag signals on its way from Shacheng to Hong Kong, but it was not inspected or detained. It has now arrived safely in Hong Kong. At present, no ships from Taikoo, Yilong, and other companies are sailing to Shacheng.

Jiangsu to Test the Waters in Xinghua and Quanzhou

British shipping companies are trying to maintain navigation to ports such as Shantou, which have been suspended due to the Japanese naval blockade of China's coastal shipping lanes. Although repeatedly obstructed by the Japanese, the Nanyang-class ships are still testing the waters. Now, the Taikoo Company has scheduled the Jiangsu ship to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 4th, deciding to test the waters in Xinghua and Quanzhou. It is said that this decision to test the waters is experimental in nature, so it is difficult to predict whether there will be any problems. The company has decided to use barges to transport passengers and cargo to the wharf.

### Yesterday Afternoon, the Huangpu River Tide Was High

The new Pacific hurricane reached 26 degrees north latitude and 136 degrees east longitude within a range of 120 nautical miles at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. According to the above-mentioned position, it is in the middle of the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese-owned Ogasawara Islands. The wind direction is northeast-east, so Shanghai is unlikely to be attacked. According to the observatory's report at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a new hurricane was also brewing in the southern part of the Pacific Ryukyu Islands, at 24 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude within a range of 60 nautical miles. Because it is in a static state, its trend is unknown. However, this hurricane is very strong, and the atmospheric pressure along the Japanese coast and the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is also showing a similar decline, so its trend and development are worthy of attention. As for the climate in this city, it was quite hot yesterday. According to the observatory's records, the highest temperature before 3:00 p.m. reached 91.5 degrees, and the lowest temperature was 76.8 degrees. The weather was clear all day. In addition, the tide in the Huangpu River was quite high at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The tide water seeped out of the low-lying roads and sewers. There will still be high tides today, and it will not return to normal until the 5th.

### Autumn Cocoon Problem Not Resolved; Silk Factories' Future is Pessimistic; Merchants Who Sold Futures Agree to Postpone Delivery; Factories Suffer Losses Due to Japanese Obstruction

Silk factories in the concession were forced to shut down earlier because raw materials were exhausted. They originally intended to start work immediately after the spring cocoons were on the market. However, because the cocoons that the factories received from the occupied areas were illegally obstructed by the "China Silk Company," they were delayed in resuming work. Now the problem of shipping spring cocoons to Shanghai has been resolved. More than 40 factories in the concession, such as Lianyuan, Fulong, Yuexing, Hualun, Shanghai, and Hongfeng, have successively resumed silk reeling. However, the losses due to the obstruction of spring cocoons to Shanghai are not small.

Selling Futures Postpones Delivery

Although the factories have resumed work, there are not many raw materials. It is expected that after October, they may shut down again due to the exhaustion of raw materials. The problem of buying Qian cocoons has not yet been resolved, so the future of silk factories is quite pessimistic. As for the spring cocoon futures that the factories sold earlier, the factories and the foreign firms that were engaged in exports have agreed to postpone delivery. Before the autumn cocoon problem is resolved, the sale of futures will be temporarily suspended. Also, the shipment of spring cocoons from eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai has not yet materialized.

Exports Increased Sharply, Silk Prices Rose Slightly

The exports of Chinese silk in the first half of this year were: (1) white silk 167,827 kilograms, worth 1,457,000 yuan, (2) white silk 268,285 kilograms, worth 3,461,000 yuan, (3) white filature silk 937,269 kilograms, worth 20,547,000 yuan, (4) yellow filature silk, yellow silk 315,074 kilograms, worth 2,576,000 yuan, (5) waste silk 1,178,874 kilograms, worth 2,596,000 yuan, (6) gray silk, palace silk, etc., 126,325 kilograms, worth 1,000,000 yuan. Chinese silk exports have increased sharply compared to last year. The price has risen to 3,200 yuan per picul.

### Save Money on the Ullambana Festival to Help Refugees: Mr. Jin Zongcheng's Proposal

Mr. Jin Zongcheng, chairman of the Xin Xin Company, said that the seventh month of the lunar calendar is approaching, and it is customary to hold the Ullambana Festival, which wastes a lot of money. It is better to propose helping the refugees. His intention is very important. Mr. Jin told a visitor yesterday that there are two important problems in Shanghai: one is that prices are rising and life is becoming more difficult, and the other is that diseases are increasing in the hot summer weather. The most painful thing about these two problems is that they are sleeping on the streets

Poor and Have Nowhere to Go

Since the outbreak of the war, the number of refugees who have been displaced by the war is countless. The suffering they have suffered from being displaced, homeless, and without food is the most tragic thing in the world. In Shanghai alone, there are hundreds of thousands of refugees, some of whom are temporarily accommodated in shelters and provided with food, which barely solves the problem of clothing, food, and medical care. However, the general public who sleep on the streets, who are poor and have nowhere to go, after the shortage of auxiliary coins in the market, it is very difficult to beg for money, and now they have to suffer from rising prices and summer diseases, which makes them feel more like they are in

Deep Water and Scorching Heat.

Human beings have an innate sense of compassion, and when they see the plight of these refugees, everyone will inevitably feel compassion. Because the seventh month of the lunar calendar is approaching, the citizens of Shanghai have always had a habit of initiating the Ullambana Festival to help the ghosts in the underworld, which can also be regarded as a charitable undertaking. The cost of a month is really considerable. However, helping the ghosts in the underworld cannot be seen, and helping these refugees can be seen with one's own eyes. At the present time, of course, we must first take care of what we see with our own eyes, and saving the living

Is More Important Than Saving the Dead.

As the saying goes, "A penny does not fall into empty space." It is the same as helping, and it is the same as accumulating virtue in secret. If you help refugees, it is called "Heaven has the virtue of good life in the streets." This kind of merit is even greater. I hope that the charitable citizens of Shanghai will pay more attention. Saving people is saving yourself. Everyone should quickly use the money from the Ullambana Festival to help the refugees.

### The Bank of China Issues the Second Installment of Construction Bonds Yesterday; Bond Amount is 30 Million National Currency; Repayment to be Completed Over 25 Years Starting in the 30th Year of the Republic

In order to carry out construction matters, the National Government ordered the Chongqing General Office of the Central Bank to issue 28-year construction bonds, with a total amount of 60 million yuan, divided into two installments, each with 30 million yuan. The first installment was issued and completed on April 1. The second installment was also issued at face value yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:

Second Installment of Construction Bonds Issued Yesterday

The total amount of the second installment of construction bonds is still 30 million yuan, and it was officially issued by the Chongqing General Office of the Bank of China yesterday. The annual interest rate is set at six percent. The repayment method is scheduled to start repaying the principal from January 31 of the 30th year of the Republic and be fully repaid in 25 years. The purpose of issuing these bonds is based on the central government's designation of completed construction and newly established national enterprises, as well as all other construction matters. The large sum of money obtained from the issuance of these bonds is intended to be combined with the special funds for construction projects levied under the salt tax item to form a construction fund. The bond custodian is responsible for the management committee of the national debt fund. The repayment agencies are designated as the Bank of China and other entrusted banks.

Chongqing General Office Responsible for Handling

According to a spokesman for the Bank of China yesterday, since the Shanghai war, the head office of the bank moved to Chongqing long ago. All issuance and repayment procedures for public bonds are handled entirely by the head office. The Shanghai branch is only a communication agency. Moreover, China's asset class flocked to the mainland before the war. The head offices of other private banks have also moved to the mainland. Most people are contacting the head office for the purchase of this second phase of bonds. The Shanghai branch has not received any instructions from the head office to handle such bond matters, neither before nor after. As for the types of face value of the bonds issued, it is estimated to be the same as ordinary bonds. The rumors about the Shanghai branch handling the matter are completely inaccurate.

### Auxiliary Coinage to be Shipped to Shanghai Regularly

Totaling 500,000

After the severe shortage of copper coins in the Shanghai market in mid-month, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting a quick solution. The Ministry of Finance ordered the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank to issue one-cent, five-cent, and fractional currency notes, and ordered the Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture Banks to transport auxiliary currency notes to Shanghai for relief. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that a large number of one-dime and two-dime auxiliary currency notes from the Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture Banks have already arrived in Shanghai and are being distributed in the market by the four banks. The one-cent, five-cent, and fractional currency notes are printed by the Yongning Company in Hong Kong, totaling 300,000 yuan for one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan for five-cent notes. They are expected to be delivered by Hong Kong in mid-August and shipped to Shanghai for distribution by the Central Bank. As for the casting of lead coins, it is being discussed between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.

### Foreign and Chinese Employees Given Free Passes

According to police station news, the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps in Hongkou has officially announced that Chinese employees hired by foreigners who wish to go north of the Suzhou Creek can request a free pass. The previous report that each pass would cost two-and-a-half cents has been cancelled.

### Why Does a Love Vow Suddenly Vanish Like a Flash in the Pan?

— Dr. Yang Nan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University

Those who cannot fully develop their rationality, but instead indulge in fantasies and are moved by emotions, are bound to misguide the future of young men and women, and this must be attributed to the doctrine of free love. We have no objection to the saying that love is an element of marriage. However, it is a prejudice to regard marriage as an essential condition for the establishment of love. There are not a few who create love after marriage. On the contrary, there are many young people who, when the heat of love is too high, disregard everything and make vows of love, but how long does it take for them to become enemies like fire and water, incompatible with each other, and their love disappears like a flash in the pan? What is the reason for this? In a word, this is entirely due to the disintegration of sexual function, which cannot bear the difficult work of reproduction. Because in the love of men and women, no more than 30% comes from the fusion of spirits, and 70% comes from carnal desire. Therefore, if men and women do not have sexual life as a medium, they will never be able to complete the whole story. Young people who value love often masturbate before talking about love. Their sexual function is damaged by masturbation. Once they enter into a real married life, it is difficult to cheer up, and their love history will be like a flash in the pan, and heartbreak is inevitable. In the old-fashioned marriage, people get married based only on the words of matchmakers and the orders of parents. There are many who have a fulfilling love life after marriage. This is probably because their reproductive power stabilizes their foundation. Therefore, rather than taking love, which is prone to change and uncertainty, as an essential element of marriage, it is better to take healthy energy and strong reproductive power as essential elements of marriage. If this can be used as a standard, then the love of husband and wife can be maintained permanently. However, the above conditions should be possessed by every man. Do not be promiscuous before marriage, and masturbation should be strictly prohibited. Those who have seminal emission should seek treatment immediately. Those who feel kidney deficiency should not seek unreasonable treatment. According to my many years of experience in treating this disease, using the genuine German testicular endocrine preparation "Body-Con" for men can fully enhance their reproductive function, promote metabolism, and treat premature aging and nocturnal emission, like a wind sweeping away fallen leaves, with a miraculous effect. Excessive sexual intercourse and other abuse of semen, such as masturbation, cause the internal secretion fluid produced by the testicles to fall short of demand, not only causing impotence, but also lacking this type of secretion fluid in the blood, which greatly affects the health of the body. Therefore, using the testicular essence preparation "Body-Con" for men to treat the above symptoms has special effects.

Modern Medicine

### How to Improve Memory

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Anyone who establishes a great career must have extraordinary brainpower. Those who are quick-witted and have a strong memory can always gain the upper hand. For example, students and business people who hold calculations and calculate, their achievements and chances of success will naturally be superior. However, this is not a gift that ordinary people often get, so success belongs to the minority. This is the old concept of the past. Now, thanks to scientific progress, this kind of riddle has begun to be explained. What people used to think was endowed by a few people can now be transformed by human power. It is estimated that the memory in the brain is generally above the horizontal line, and most of those who fall below the horizontal line are those who abuse masturbation or indulge in early marriage during the developmental period, which greatly hinders the development of the youth glands. And memory is also becoming weaker day by day. Often what happened yesterday is like a past life, and the books that are recited cannot be memorized even if they are occupied all day long due to the weakness of memory. As a result, the spirit becomes more and more depressed, and the career becomes more and more unsuccessful. The dreary life becomes more and more boring, and there is always a desire to commit suicide.

However, there is now a scientific method to solve the biggest regret in life. Patients who suffer from poor memory, lack of memory, and lack of judgment can all take "Body-Con" invented by Dr. Mellen of Germany. This medicine can help the development of youth glands and increase the cell power of memory in the brain. And make the muscles delicate, white and elastic. Strong memory and abundant muscles are only available in youth, and most young people are ruined by masturbation and excessive sexual activity during the developmental period. As a result, like a tender bud that has just emerged, it is destroyed by wind and storms, and it will naturally wither and fall, so there is a sign of premature aging. However, if you take "Body-Con", it is like a long drought meeting sweet rain, and the millet valley returns to spring. Not only will your memory increase, but you will also regain the youthful and lively appearance. If students who study hard and business people who hold calculations and calculate, and therefore have poor memory, take "Body-Con", the effect is unparalleled.

### Too Much Phlegm Prevents Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

People with a lot of phlegm must feel difficulty in breathing and act anxiously. The phlegm is thick and sticky, either white or yellow, thin or thick, and often has many black lumps in the morning. During the cough, it is easy to develop pneumonia, so it is necessary to treat and remedy it urgently. People with healthy lungs must have less phlegm, and those with lung disease must have more phlegm. According to the principles of medicine, eliminating cough and phlegm requires supplementing the lungs as a prerequisite—and "Lung Supplementing Nal" is indeed an effective preparation for relieving cough and expectorant. Its efficacy surpasses cod liver oil, and after taking "Lung Supplementing Nal", those who have not yet developed tuberculosis can prevent pulmonary tuberculosis, and those who have already developed tuberculosis can completely cure stage 1, 2, and 3 lung diseases, such as hemoptysis and night sweats. Symptoms such as asthma are all targeted, and major hospitals and experts around the world regard this medicine as a special medicine for lung diseases.

### Case of Cured Spermatorrhea: Unsuccessful Love Leads to Nocturnal Emission

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Patient Dong Youlin, from Xiamen, Fujian, 22 years old (self-reported). Last spring, he fell in love with a girlfriend, but later, due to disagreements among the parents, he could not get his wish. Since then, every time he was drowsy in his sleep, all the illusions would surge up and become nocturnal emission, which gradually increased, so he came to me for treatment (treatment process). He was ordered to recuperate, engage in noble entertainment, rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, and take three tablets of "Nes Spermatorrhea Tablets". Mr. Dong followed my words, and after two months, no seminal emission occurred.

### Early Damage Leads to Impotence After Marriage

Patient Shi Weikang, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, 25 years old, (self-reported). In his early years, he liked to read erotic books, and was also seduced by his companions, often playing with his sexual organs to enjoy ejaculation. Later, he often had seminal emission, but he did not pay much attention to it. He got married at the age of 23, but could not last long in sexual intercourse, only half a minute, and his sexual organs were as short as a child's. For the sake of happiness, he came to seek treatment. (Treatment process) He received daily electrotherapy, took "Nes Spermatorrhea Tablets" to consolidate his sperm gate, and also took "Body-Con" to treat his premature ejaculation and phlegm. He was cured in about three months.

Trivia on Gonorrhea

### The Pain of Gonorrheal Arthritis

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road. Gonorrhea leading to arthritis means that the person has lost the chance to recover quickly and has transformed into a systemic infection of gonorrhea. Although there are many causes, to get to the bottom of it, it is nothing more than gonorrhea patients who delay treatment and whose remaining toxins attack internally. Moreover, due to the stimulation of alcohol and sexual activity, these cunning gonococci spread throughout the body through blood circulation. If gonococci remain in the joints, arthritis will result. The patient experiences alternating chills and fever, joint swelling, sudden severe pain, and a state of tension and fluctuation, fatigue, and loss of appetite. At this point, the scope of the gonococci is expanding day by day, so it is unpredictable and cannot be treated by general local surgery or transmembrane bactericidal agents.

Since there are many such gonococci entrenched and causing trouble in the whole body's joints, it is impossible to remove them one branch at a time. A fundamental solution must be made by taking the overall situation into consideration. Therefore, it is necessary to give the whole body cells the effect of resisting lymph-phagocytic bacteria. Since the virus is so pervasive throughout the body, how can local surgical treatment be used to seek efficacy? Now there is a scientific method to solve this matter. That is, German X-ray electrotherapy and static electrotherapy are used alternately in physical therapy. On the one hand, German anti-gonorrheal blood serum and the special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinong" are taken internally, which can immediately reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and reduce swelling. Because after taking "Kelinong", anti-lymph-phagocytic bacteria will be produced in a short period of time. On the one hand, it helps anti-gonorrheal blood serum, and static X-electrotherapy can further exert the special great effect of "Kelinong" in killing bacteria. Therefore, the gonococci hidden in the deep part of the joints are completely eliminated, and on the other hand, the effects of anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antiseptic are obtained. Therefore, if the joint swelling and pain are not suppurated internally, taking "Kelinong" can be insured against prevention and eliminate it and restore it to its original state. Consultation hours...10 am to 6 pm. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen every day, and each patient will only be charged 5 jiao for the number and will be given a free copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan.

### The Public Works Department's Security Committee Discusses Traffic Management Issues; Strengthens Crackdown on Illegal Speeding of Bicycles; Car Drivers Driving Too Fast Should be Held Accountable

When the Security Committee of the Public Works Department held a meeting on the 20th of last month, it discussed many motions on traffic matters. At that time, the opinions of the Chinese Automobile Association were provided for the reference of the committee members, and the Westerner Lederer attended the meeting to express his opinions. Mr. Lederer had already given a speech on traffic management matters at the last annual meeting of foreign taxpayers. The summary of his speech was also reviewed by the committee members. The results of the discussion are recorded separately below.

Crackdown on Illegal Bicycles

The Chinese Automobile Association has investigated bicycles on the streets and found that they often speed recklessly, causing many dangers. It is imperative to strictly crack down on them. Regarding this matter, the committee members of the Security Committee now know that the police department of the bureau has taken strict measures. On average, 527 bicycle riders are prosecuted every month. The police department also sends warnings and propaganda materials on road safety to bicycle riders and bicycle shops one after another. At that time, someone in the meeting advocated that those who did not follow the rules or obeyed the command of the police should be severely punished, such as detention. However, the chief of the police department believed that it was not appropriate to implement detention. The current method adopted by the police for these people is to pry off their licenses. Afterwards, the car owner pays a fine to the court. The chief of the police department also said that bicycles are a common means of transportation, and the number of violations will inevitably increase day by day. The committee members immediately resolved to request the bureau to instruct the police department to strengthen the crackdown on bicycle riders who violate traffic regulations and do not obey the command of the police.

Parking Problem on Haig Road

The Chinese Automobile Association also stated that parking should be prohibited on the south side of Haig Road, near the Western Girls' School and the German General Assembly Hall, in order to reduce danger. The police department said that this matter should be considered by the police department of the French Concession. The section proposed by the association has been forwarded for verification.

Crackdown on Excessive Car Speed

Trucks and taxis often drive too fast in busy sections of the concession, such as Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, especially when they are empty. The Chinese Automobile Association believes that excessive speed is particularly dangerous and should be cracked down on, and suggests that special attention be paid by the motorcycle patrol team. According to the report of the chief of the police department, the department has ordered patrol officers to strengthen their monitoring of this matter. As a result, a total of 127 drivers were prosecuted last month. The committee members stated that the patrol and prosecution of the police department should be effective.

Problem of Cars Overtaking Front Cars

The Chinese Automobile Association also put forward an opinion, saying that cars often overtake other vehicles that are proceeding in the same direction or waiting for traffic lights on Avenue Edward VII, especially during the busy hours at noon. Recently, there have been more and more heavy trucks in the area, so the vehicles are moving very slowly. Cars with lower horsepower cannot overtake trucks, which makes the vehicles even more congested. As a result, cars with higher speeds often disregard the current traffic regulations when driving forward, overtaking vehicles in front and trying to pass through slow-moving trucks. To remedy this, it is proposed that the Public Works Department draw two white boundary lines on the road surface of Avenue Edward VII. Heavy trucks are only allowed to travel within the left-hand boundary line, so that fast-moving vehicles can overtake the vehicles in front between the two lines. This method can have a psychological impact on drivers. It has long been adopted in European and American countries. The police department believes that the width of the road on Avenue Edward VII is insufficient, and overtaking is prone to danger and violates the prohibition. The above suggestions are sufficient to encourage drivers to drive illegally and are prone to collisions with oncoming vehicles. The police officers stationed on Avenue Edward VII have been ordered to pay attention to overtaking. The committee members agreed with the points made by the police department. Someone in the meeting also argued that too much land was being wasted on both sides of Avenue Edward VII. The departments in charge of the Public Works Department should find ways to move all the platforms on the road closer to the side stones, so as to widen the road surface available for fast-moving vehicles. The Public Works Department continued to say that if all the platforms could be removed, the traffic could be greatly improved. However, the purpose of installing the platforms is to divide slow-moving and fast-moving vehicles, and to allow vehicles to park between the two platforms. If the road surface used by fast-moving vehicles is widened, it is doubtful whether there will still be enough space to park vehicles and drive slow-moving vehicles. Moreover, there are many collapsed cars passing through Avenue Edward VII, so attention must be paid to them. Any changes to the road administration of Avenue Edward VII must be approved by the French Concession.

Improve the Road Surface of the Racecourse Road

The road surface on both sides of the Racecourse Road is slightly rough and uneven. Therefore, most collapsed cars, rickshaws, and bicycles travel in the center of the road. The Chinese Automobile Association believes that this situation is contrary to the intention of widening the Racecourse Road and should be improved. It is also suggested that three traffic boundary lines be drawn on the road surface. Regarding this matter, the police department has submitted a report, stating that measures to restrict slow-moving vehicles on the Racecourse Road and other roads have been implemented. The Public Works Department has been asked to pay attention to the problem of uneven road surfaces. The road surface on both sides of the Racecourse Road is indeed uneven and prone to danger, so all vehicles are not allowed to overtake the vehicles in front. The chief of the Public Works Department once said that when the Racecourse Road was built, due to the lack of materials and the desire to save money, the road surface on both sides was built with old materials, so it could not be as flat as the central part of the road. However, trolleybuses will soon be running on this road, and at that time, the road surface on both sides will have to be rebuilt.

Advocate for Collapsed Cars to Install Rubber Wheels

The Chinese Automobile Association also proposes that the authorities of the two concessions notify all collapsed cars and rickshaws to install rubber tires and stipulate that from a certain date (presumably January 1 of next year), all collapsed cars with iron wheels will not be allowed to obtain licenses. The chief of the police department reported that the replacement of iron wheels on collapsed cars with rubber wheels is in progress. The committee members also reported that the Public Works Department, in view of the fact that collapsed cars with iron wheels easily damage the road surface, had repeatedly discussed the issue of replacing them with rubber wheels in the past few years, and decided that in order to encourage car owners, those collapsed cars that have been retrofitted with rubber wheels would be allowed to be exempted from half of the license fee from July 1, 1937. When the board of directors of the Public Works Department passed this motion, it made it clear that the bureau was unwilling to take mandatory measures regarding the retrofitting of wheels on collapsed cars. In December last year, in order to further encourage it, the Public Works Department revised the license fee table for collapsed cars, allowing these vehicles that have been fitted with rubber wheels to carry more goods than those of the same grade that have not been fitted with rubber wheels, which will be implemented from July 1 of this year. Regarding this matter, the Security Committee still advocates not taking mandatory measures. (End of Section 1)

### The Taikoo Steamer Jiangsu Anchors Outside the Port for Quarantine

The Taikoo Steamship Company's South China liner Jiangsu, which was scheduled to come to Shanghai from Hong Kong via Xiamen, had a fireman die on board en route. The ship telegraphed the Shanghai office and reported it to the Customs Quarantine Office, requesting an inspection. Therefore, after arriving at the mouth of Wusong yesterday afternoon, it anchored outside the port to wait for inspection. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it did not enter the port. Whether it can come to Shanghai today depends on the completion of the quarantine procedures before it can enter the port. The company has already decided that the ship will sail from Shanghai to Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Haiphong in Guangzhou Bay today, and now it has been changed to tomorrow. If it still does not enter the port today, the South China trip tomorrow will be postponed again.

### An Old Woman Was Killed in an Accident

Lin Dai, an old woman from Huzhou, was 66 years old. She lived at a certain number on Hardoon Road in West Shanghai. At about 9:30 last night, she and her daughter went to Connaught Road to buy tea. Unfortunately, a No. 10 bus with license plate number 1543 sped by. Because the old woman was old and slow, she could not avoid it and was hit in the chest, critically injuring her. She was taken to a certain hospital in West Shanghai by ambulance for treatment, but it was ineffective and she died soon after.

### HWAXING COTTON WEAVING MILL: ACCOUNTANT SUDDENLY KIDNAPPED; KOREAN MAN BORROWS LICENSE FOR TEST DRIVE; CHEN XIAOBAO ARRESTED ON SUSPICION

On the 30th of last month, around 10 AM, six kidnappers in a black-plated car sped to No. 44 Caobang, Daxilu, Yidingpan Road, in the Chinese territory of western Shanghai, near the Huaxing Cotton Mill. They got out of the car and went straight into the mill, asking to see the manager, Dong Gengsheng, for an important matter. As Dong was out, the accountant, Dong Yunshu, met them instead. Unexpectedly, these people suddenly pulled out guns and threatened him, sending two kidnappers to guard the door. Without asking any questions, they

carried out the kidnapping,

pushing Dong Yunshu into the car parked nearby. Like lightning, they disappeared in an instant. Subsequently, the mill reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station, which dispatched Chinese detective Wang Yubin and foreign detective Baideng to investigate. They learned that the black-plated car number was 1368, belonging to Wang Zinian, a trauma doctor at No. 5, Lane 23, Fuxu Road. The Chinese and foreign detectives immediately went to Dr. Wang's place to investigate and learned that the car had been entrusted to the Huanan Automobile Company at No. 365 Fuxu Road for sale. The detectives then went to Huanan to investigate and indeed discovered the 1368 car

license plates, two pieces.

However, according to the staff of Huanan Automobile Company, the 1368 car had already been sold, but the license plates were left in the company. On June 27th, Liu Dafu, a Korean man residing in the Youth Corps in Hongkou, bought a black hemp cloth car from the company. At the time, due to mechanical damage, it was slightly repaired and then driven out for a test drive. At that time, there were no license plates on the car, so the Korean man wanted to temporarily borrow the 1368 number, claiming that he would return it immediately. Unexpectedly, he never came back. It was not until 6 PM on July 3rd that Liu Dafu

accompanied a Chinese man,

together riding a Yunfei car No. 12315, to the Huanan car dealership, returning the 1368 license plates. However, this procedure was handled by Chen Xiaobao (18 years old), a Wuxi native learning to be a car mechanic at Huanan car dealership. At the time, Chen was not present, so the matter was not investigated. On one hand, they immediately went to Yunfei to inquire. According to the driver Li Amao, it was confirmed that someone hired a car that day, driven by him to the side of the Met Hesit Road telephone company, with a Korean man and a Chinese man riding together to the Huanan car dealership. The Chinese and foreign detectives returned to the police station after investigating this. On the 31st, they returned to

Huanan Automobile

Company, and arrested Chen Xiaobao. Suspecting his involvement, or complicity, they took him to the Jing'an Temple police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang detailed the above situation, requesting permission for detention in order to continue the investigation. Chen Xiaobao, defended by lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, was interrogated by the judge, who ordered Chen Xiaobao to be detained for seven days for further investigation. The reason for Dong Yunshu's kidnapping is currently under investigation by the police.

### ROBBERY OF HUGE SUM OF MONEY AT A CERTAIN FAMILY'S HOME ON TIANJIN ROAD; ROBBERS OPEN FIRE AND INJURE A PERSON ON BINLANG ROAD

At a certain family's home, No. 12, Lane 170, Tianjin Road, in the Public Concession, at 11:45 AM yesterday, three robbers broke in. Two robbers threatened them with guns, and as a result, 25,000 yuan in national currency was robbed, and they escaped with the loot. Afterward, the victim reported the incident to the relevant police station, requesting an arrest.

Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, robbers suddenly broke into No. 881 Binlang Road, West Shanghai, to carry out a robbery. The victim immediately shouted for help to catch the robbers. The robbers then opened fire, hitting the victim with a bullet. The victim fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Nearby Chinese police officers arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested the robbers on the spot. The injured person summoned an ambulance and was taken to the hospital for treatment.

Yesterday morning around 10 AM, a man walking near Daxilu Difeng Road was suddenly attacked by two unarmed robbers who robbed him of 430 yuan in legal tender and escaped without a trace.

### JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS OF BOTH COURTS PETITION TO RESTORE ORIGINAL SALARIES; COURT CLERKS ALSO REQUEST RAISES

Huawen News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the August 13th incident, the First and Second Special District Local Courts of the Public and French Concessions in this city, as well as the First, Second, and Third Sub-Courts of the High Court, received orders from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to pay the salaries of presidents, judges, prosecutors, clerks, etc., at 70% of the original amount to conserve funds. It has been two years since the implementation. Recently, with the tightening of foreign exchange and the rise in prices, the cost of living in society has increased several times. The judges, prosecutors, and clerks of the court as a whole, due to the 70% salary, cannot maintain their livelihoods. They separately petitioned the Ministry of Judicial Administration in Chongqing to restore the original salaries to be paid in full. However, no decision has been received from the ministry so far. At the same time, the court clerks and other personnel of both courts, due to the difficulty of life, jointly submitted a petition to the president yesterday, requesting a salary increase.

### LI YONGKUAN AND SON CASE: TESTIMONY CONTINUED YESTERDAY

The case of Li Yongkuan and his son, notorious salt smugglers and bandits from Anhui, who were accused of robbery and murder, has been repeatedly tried and investigated by Judge Liao Yan in conjunction with the prosecutor, and the conclusion was announced, with a date set for sentencing. Later, due to suspicions about the Li family plotting to kill the mother of the victim Lin, and the Li's wife's statement that the gold ring in the hanging case was exchanged by herself at Baochang Jewelry Store, not stolen, it was deemed that there were still doubtful points that had not been clarified. A detailed investigation and review was required, so the conclusion of the debate was canceled, and the debate was reopened after a scheduled hearing. This newspaper has reported the details of the matter repeatedly. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao ordered the three Li father and son to be brought to the First Criminal Court, and Li's wife Yao, daughter Rongzhen, and Li's son-in-law Zhang, as well as employees of Baochang Jewelry Store, were summoned to the court. First, Li Rongzhen was questioned about the circumstances surrounding her brother Jiaqu's killing of Lin Xiuhua's mother, Lin Jinshi. Then, the Baochang Jewelry Store was questioned about the gold ring exchange, and after checking the jewelry store's account books, there was no record of the sale of a gold ring with the style, pattern, weight of the hanging case. When Li Yao and Zhang were questioned, they still insisted that they exchanged it at Baochang, etc. After verifying the testimony in court, it was ordered to reschedule the hearing for the 10th of this month. The defendants were still detained, and the witnesses were dismissed. On the second day of this month, from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM, if the weather is good, the Municipal Council Music Band will hold a brass concert in French Park. The program includes seven items.

### COUNTY MAGISTRATE'S CONCUBINE ESCAPES WITH FUNDS; MONK PUNISHED FOR RECEIVING STOLEN GOODS; ALLOWED TO POST 8,000 YUAN SHOP GUARANTEE DURING APPEAL PERIOD

Yang Yunwu from Gaoyou, who served as a county magistrate in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong provinces, fled after the "August 13th" incident with his beloved concubine Sun Lanzhen and lived in the Sanjiao Leshan Temple on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, Mubu. His concubine frequently associated with the monk Wan Yuan (secular name Tong Changyao) of the temple. Later, Yang and Sun moved to No. 3, Lane 44, Laoerdong Road. Sun still maintained contact with the monk Wan Yuan. On May 28th of this year, Sun suddenly absconded with 6,500 yuan in cash and gold jewelry. After the case occurred, the French Concession police, due to Monk Wan Yuan's receipt of stolen goods, ordered detectives to arrest him. Along with the stolen goods, such as embroidered pillowcases, seized from the monk's residence, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for prosecution on charges of receiving stolen goods. The defendant monk Wan Yuan hired lawyer Xu Wufang to defend him. The case has been tried by Judge Qiu. Yesterday morning, he announced the verdict in the Eighth Criminal Court. The main text stated: Tong Changyao, also known as Monk Wan Yuan, received stolen goods and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. The accompanying civil lawsuit part will be transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. The defendant is allowed to post an 8,000 yuan shop guarantee during the appeal period.

### SONGJIANG WEALTHY GENTLEMAN QIAN XUANQING; GRANDSON SUES FOR DIVISION OF INHERITANCE; JUDGMENT SHOULD RECEIVE ONE-SEVENTH

Qian Xuanqing, a wealthy man from Songjiang, had real estate located in Zhangyan, Qianwei, Songjiang, Jinshan County, and west of the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport, totaling 3,970 mu of fertile land. There were also five houses in Songjiang, and as for movable property, there were stocks of Shanghai Yongyu Pawnshop, Xinyuanchang, and World Bookstore, as well as gold jewelry, totaling a value of

Zhou's daughter, Qian Runwen, married a Han and had five sons, Jiepan, Zanyu, Shengshou, Shengjue, and Shengqi. Qian Runwen had also passed away. Han Jiepan and others, because their maternal grandfather's inheritance was controlled by Xie Jianjia,

this spring

together with their aunt Tang Qian Runduan, jointly hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Li Gengxiang, and Ge Bangren to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering the defendants Xie Jianjia, Qian Runlin, Qian Runhu, Qian Runci, Qian Runliang, Qian Runming, etc., to completely hand over all of Qian Xuanqing's inheritance, to be divided into seven shares, with Han Jiepan, Han Zanyu, Han Shengshou, Han Shengjue, Han Shengqi getting one-seventh in total, Tang Qian Runduan getting one-seventh, Qian Runlin, Qian Runhu, Qian Runci, Qian Runliang, Qian Runming each getting

one-seventh.

The court, after receiving the complaint, repeatedly summoned the defendants Xie Jianjia, Qian Runlin, etc., by Judge Ma Yishu. The defendants Xie Jianjia, Qian Runlin, etc., hired lawyers Zhang Yipeng, etc., to appear in court to respond. Recently, after Judge Ma inquired clearly, he announced the judgment in the Seventh Court yesterday, ordering the defendant Qian Runlin and others to distribute one-seventh of Qian Xuanqing's entire inheritance to the plaintiffs Han Jiepan and others, and dismissing the rest of the plaintiff Tang Qian Runduan's lawsuit. The litigation costs are to be borne equally by the plaintiff and defendant.

### HENAN EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES AND SCHOOL STATUS: PROVINCIAL FUNDS TIGHTENED, COUNTY FUNDS TRY TO RESTORE, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS RELOCATE THREE TIMES

(Nanyang Correspondence) The Henan Provincial Education Administration formulated educational policies before the war, setting specific standards for vocational normal, senior and junior high school education, as well as school administration and discipline, and actively implemented them. After the outbreak of the war, it formulated four key points of wartime education policy, with standards suitable for the needs of the times for schools at all levels, social education, mass education, and special education, which were effectively implemented.

### Educational Expenses

"Provincial Funds": The budget for the 26th year before the war was 2,899,900 yuan. By October of the 26th year, all schools were spending at 80% of the original amount. In March of the 27th year, various affiliated agencies were cut and merged, and the schools that had relocated were reorganized. A total of 45 classes were cut in secondary schools throughout the province, saving more than 25,000 yuan per month. In August of the 27th year, the funds for primary and secondary schools were issued at 56.7% of the budget for the 26th year. In February of the 28th year, the provincial primary school classes were reorganized, cutting 27 classes, saving 61,000 yuan per year. As a result of the successive tightening, the budget for the second half of the 27th year was 1,024,180 yuan, and the budget for the 28th year was 1,997,807 yuan. "County Funds": 3,405,454 yuan for the 26th year before the war, 1,638,319 yuan for the second half of the 27th year during the war, and 3,349,846 yuan was extended according to the budget for the 26th year in the 28th year. The highest was Anyang with 103,166 yuan, and Xuchang with 73,237 yuan. The lowest were Jingfu with 7,058 yuan, Song County with 3,709 yuan, and Lushi with 5,663 yuan.

### School Conditions

Various schools have undergone three relocations. The "First" decision was made in October of the 26th year (of the Republic, i.e. 1937). Due to the tense situation in northern Henan, the private Jiaozuo Institute of Technology moved to Chang'an; Anyang High School moved to Wuyang; Baiquan Normal School and Gaoyang Junior High School moved to Runan; Qinyang Junior High School moved to Zheng County; Wuzhi Junior High School moved to Dengfeng; Jixian Normal School, Jixian Junior High School, and Jixian Vocational School moved to Yuxian; Anyang Private Binyang Junior High School moved to Xiangcheng. The "Second" decision was made in January of the 27th year (i.e. 1938). Due to the tense situation in Ji'nan and Xuzhou, and the severe situation in the Zhengzhou area, Henan University's Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences moved to Jigongshan; the Colleges of Agriculture and Medicine, the Water Conservancy College, Kaifeng High School, and Kaifeng Women's Normal School moved to Zhenping; Kaifeng Normal School and Kaifeng Girls' High School moved to Xichuan; Kaifeng Vocational School moved to Neixiang; Kaifeng Junior High School moved to Shangcheng; Shangqiu High School moved to Huaiyang; Private Liming High School moved to Sishui; Lianghe High School moved to Neixiang; Ji'zhi High School moved to Luoning; Songyang High School, Gansheng High School, and Qiangyu High School moved to Luoshan; Beicang Girls' High School moved to Nanyang; China High School moved to Lushan; Mingxin High School moved to Mixian; Modern High School moved to Nanzhao; Dahe High School moved to Gongxian; the County Arts Normal School moved to Dengfeng; Shangzhi Vocational School moved to Xinyang; and Zhongzhou Junior High School moved to Rongyang. In March of the same year, all eleven provincial elementary schools, three provincial capital elementary schools, the provincial Experimental People's School, the provincial Women's Supplementary School, and the various people's schools under the Provincial People's Education Administration were converted into wartime education work teams, and assigned to work in Xinyang, Tanghe, Biyang, Zhenping, Xichuan and other places. The "Third" time was in the summer of the 27th year (i.e. 1938). Xi'an was repeatedly bombed, so the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology moved again to Tianshui. In November, with the loss of southern Henan, Henan University's Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences moved back to Zhenping. The Provincial Education Department ordered all provincial schools south of the Funiu Mountains and east of Nanyang to move westward to Neixiang and Xichuan; all schools north of the Funiu Mountains were to first send personnel to find temporary school buildings in Lushi and Luoning before relocating. This included Luoyang Normal School, Luoyang Junior High School, and Luoyang Vocational School moving to Lushi and Luoning; Anyang Yuzhong, Huaiyang Normal School, Shangqiu High School, Huaiyang Junior High School, Qinyang Junior High School, and Jixian Normal School moving to Neixiang; Runan Junior High School and Hanchuan Junior High School moving to Xichuan. Among the private high schools, Songyang High School moved to Luoning, Beicang Girls' High School moved to Neixiang, Nanyang Girls' High School and Wannan Junior High School moved to Shiqiao, and Nandou Junior High School moved to Nantai.

### Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Discusses How to Choose Departments and Schools (Part 2) The School's Signboard Is Not Enough to Prove the Quality of the Content; There Are Several Aspects to Pay Attention to When Choosing a Department.

(4) The Principle of a School's Signboard: What has been discussed above are the principles for choosing a department. Now, when it comes to choosing a school, people usually use the quality of the school's signboard as the standard for choosing a school. This is also very reasonable. There must be a reason why everyone says a school is good, whether it is good teachers, good equipment, good academic atmosphere, or good career prospects for graduates. These are all conditions that should be valued. However, the so-called good or bad of a school is often prone to an incorrect view. For example, that the school is large in scale, has many students, has a lot of funding, has good buildings, has a good location, and often has important people giving speeches, principal meetings, and school publicity. Many people in society praise that school because of these conditions and respect that school. Needless to say, these conditions can never be the correct standard for judging the quality of a school. A large-scale school is by no means a good school, and a school with a lot of funding is even less likely to be a good school. Large schools often have very bad professors, and schools with a lot of money often waste it in vain. Conversely, small universities can also have very good teachers, and schools with little money can easily achieve excellent results. Not only is this the case when comparing Chinese universities with Chinese universities, but also when comparing Chinese universities with foreign universities, foreign universities also have professors who are sloppy and far inferior to the excellent professors in Chinese universities. Of course, large-scale schools with a lot of funding are easier to run well, but whether they can run well depends on who the principal is, who the dean is, and whether the professors hired are top-notch.

### Academic Circles in Kunming Hold a General Meeting of the Friendship Association

(Kunming, 1st) The Kunming Academic Friendship Association held its first general meeting at 4 p.m. on the 31st. More than 30 people, including Zhou Binglin, Cha Liangzhao, and Huang Shi, attended. Li Shuhua presided over the meeting and invited Chen Bisheng, an expert on border politics, to give a speech. Chen advocated for the development of roads from Yunnan to Tibet to connect the mainland with the border areas. There are two routes from Yunnan to Tibet: one from Wuding Yuanguang, passing through Huili Xichang and entering Tibet, and the other from Xiangyun Yunlong, passing through Xikang and reaching Lhasa. The construction of these two roads would greatly benefit culture and economy.

### Staff and Students in Jin and Yan Prefectures in Western Zhejiang Gather for Training, Starting Separately from the 1st.

Since the successive fall of the areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in western Zhejiang, the educational authorities in the area have followed the military and political authorities to the areas of Jinhua, Quzhou, and Yan in eastern Zhejiang to continue their work, and to intensify the work of resistance education. They have agreed to concentrate staff and students in various places for training, which is more active than before the war. More than 60,000 teachers and students in various counties and cities throughout the province have received training. After receiving the order for the fourth centralized training this year, the Department of Education immediately instructed schools at all levels to carefully select and dispatch personnel. According to reports, the number of teachers and students receiving training has greatly increased compared to the first, second, and third sessions. The training has been carried out separately in various places since August 1.

### Examination Papers for Government-Funded Students Studying in the UK in Shanghai to Be Sent to Chongqing

The Board of Trustees for the Management of the British Boxer Indemnity Funds held examinations in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Kunming, and Chongqing this time to select the seventh group of government-funded students to study in the UK. The students who took the examinations were very enthusiastic, and the examinations for various academic specialties went very well.

### Hongyi Cup Volleyball Yesterday: Hongyi Defeated; Fudan Wins in a Three-Game Thriller; Friendship Star Easily Defeats Lianqing in Women's Division

However, three Hongyi players were injured or sick, and only eight players were able to compete. After the start of the match, both teams were locked in a close battle. Fudan took the lead with 11 to 8. Zhou Dayun and Yuan Zejian continued their efforts and won the first game with 21 to 15. In the second game, the score went back and forth, with only one point difference. After 15 points each, Hongyi's main player, Zai Deyuan, used his superb skills to tie the score at 21 to 16. In the final decisive game, Hongyi tried hard to fight back and switched sides with a score of 11 to 9. After 13 points each, Fudan surpassed and took the lead with 19 to 16.

### Finance: UK's Policy Towards China Unchanged; Forex Resale Suddenly Intensified

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not change. In the private market for British and American exchange rates, the banks' intention to sell was initially weak. It was estimated that British gold would shrink again by 1.25, and the US dollar would soften by 0.25. After the opening, news suddenly broke from Reuters that Chamberlain's attitude was firm and the policy towards China would not be changed. It was also stated that regarding the Japanese demand for the 48 million taels of silver stored by China in the Tianjin concession, discussions had been held with the US and France on how to deal with the matter. As a result, the prospects for the legal tender became more optimistic, so the intention to sell by foreign firms suddenly intensified. Hong Kong also sent telegrams to sell, and Japanese banks frequently sold current British and American exchange rates, causing the market to gradually return to equilibrium. As a result, the British rate was flat, and the US dollar rose by 0.0325. It was reported that Sassoon, a Western merchant, wanted to offer a rate of US$0.0625 for the spot and end-of-month swap (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of around 8%), but foreign firms such as Datong Bank only wanted to offer US$0.50, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate of around 6.3%. Therefore, few swaps were made. Overall, trading was still active.

Opening Was Slightly Tight

In the early morning, due to the large London strip, the near-term continued to rise by 0.0625, and the far-term rose by 0.125. The New York silver price was stable, and the London gold price remained flat. In terms of exchange rates, the British rate against the US dollar was unchanged, the rate against Shanghai was slightly up by 0.06255, and the rate against France was unchanged. There were no changes in the US dollar rate against the British pound, Shanghai, or France. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. At the morning opening, the banks' selling prices for spot were 4 shillings 2.25 pence for British gold and 8.25 yuan for the US dollar, which was up by 1.25 pence for British gold and down by 0.25 yuan for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Suddenly, news broke of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo and Chamberlain's firm attitude, which caused the selling intentions of foreign firms to suddenly intensify, and the market immediately hardened. First, a British bank sold spot British gold at 4 shillings 3.125 pence to a foreign firm, then a bank sold spot US dollars at 8.3125 and 8.375 yuan to the Bombay Silver Company, and then sold spot US dollars at 8.4375 yuan to the China-Belgian-Dutch Bank. By the time HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes, and the white silver equalization tax was still exempt. After that, Hong Kong telegraphed to sell spot US dollars at 8.53125 yuan to foreign firms, and the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank also sold spot British gold at 4 shillings 3.75 pence and spot US dollars at 8.5625 yuan to the China-Belgian-Dutch Bank, which made the process quite loose. As noon approached, foreign firms took the opportunity to buy cheap, and the situation tended to level off. It was estimated that foreign firms had bought spot US dollars from foreign firms at 8.50 and 8.4375 yuan. At the noon close, the banks' selling prices for spot were 4 shillings 3.4375 pence for British gold and 8.4375 yuan for the US dollar, which was down by 0.09375 pence for British gold and up by 0.1875 yuan for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.

Japanese Banks Also Sold

In the afternoon, the Yokohama Specie Bank continued to sell spot British gold at 4 shillings 4.0625 pence to foreign firms, as well as spot US dollars at 8.53125 and 8.5625 yuan. After that, the Yokohama Specie Bank also sold British gold for this month at 4 shillings to foreign firms and also sold US dollars for this month at 7.8125 yuan to foreign firms, which made the situation stable and hard. At the evening close, the banks' selling prices for spot were 4 shillings 3.75 pence for British gold and 8.53125 yuan for the US dollar, and for British gold for this month 4 shillings and US dollars 7.78125 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound was flat and the US dollar was up by 0.03125 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Gold Market Fluctuations

Yesterday's private market for spot gold was volatile due to the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In general, it rose first, then fell, and then hovered. Initially, because the foreign exchange market opened sharply lower in the morning, bullish sentiment among dealers intensified, and they scrambled to bid up prices. In particular, a certain money exchange firm and securities brokers were actively buying, causing the morning opening to rise to 3,690 yuan, and then to a peak of 3,695 yuan. Subsequently, news broke from Reuters that Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons that he would not change his policy towards China, which gradually hardened. This caused sentiment to change. A certain gold shop's intention to sell on behalf of speculators became even stronger, and many people came to close out their positions, causing the market to decline. It once fell back to a low of 3,610 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry store (on behalf of Hong Kong) and securities brokers came to absorb at low prices, and the market gradually stabilized, hovering between 3,640 and 3,650 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 3,640 yuan, only down three yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active, at 800 to 900 taels. There were no gains or losses in jewelry gold, and the customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

### Private Market for Spot Gold Was Twisty

Since the morning opening, because the foreign exchange market opened at only 4 pence 25 for British gold and only 8.25 yuan for US dollars, the sentiment among dealers was buoyant. For a time, large sums were eagerly purchased, causing a significant increase in prices. The opening price was raised by 47 yuan. A certain money exchange firm bought 30 taels from a certain gold shop and 20 taels from a cash shop, at a price of 3,690 yuan. Then, it rose by another five yuan. Securities brokers bought 40 taels from a certain gold shop, at a price of 3,695 yuan, which was the peak for the day. At that time, it was suddenly heard that the foreign exchange market was hardening due to the intensified selling by foreign firms, so buyers waited and watched. In an instant, it fell back by 45 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 50 taels to a certain jewelry store, at a price of 3,650 yuan. Later, securities brokers came to absorb again, and prices rose again. Securities brokers bought 50 taels from the money exchange firm, at a price of 3,665 yuan. After that, although a certain jewelry store and a certain money exchange firm and securities brokers absorbed from each other, the foreign exchange market gradually hardened, and a certain gold shop continued to sell on behalf of speculators, the market tended to decline. Soon, it plunged by 55 yuan. The cash shop sold 10 taels to a certain silver shop, at a price of 3,610 yuan, which was the low for the day. After 11:30, it was heard that the foreign exchange market had stopped loosening and was slightly soft, so the buying intention became stronger, and the price immediately rebounded. A certain jewelry store bought 40 taels from a certain gold shop, at a price of 3,635 yuan. Then, securities brokers bought 10 taels from the money exchange firm, at a price of 3,650 yuan. Later, the jewelry store sold 10 taels to a certain silver shop, and the price fell back to 3,635 yuan. As noon approached, a certain money exchange firm bought 50 taels from a dealer, at 3,645 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the opening price rose by 10 yuan. The money exchange firms traded 20 taels among themselves, at a price of 3,655 yuan. After the opening, a certain gold shop and money exchange firms frequently sold, and the market weakened. Before long, it fell by 15 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 30 taels to securities brokers, at a price of 3,640 yuan. Later, the money exchange firm bought 30 taels from the jewelry store, at a price of 3,642 yuan. Then, the gold shops traded 20 taels among themselves, at a price of 3,645 yuan. At 3:20, the money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves, at a price of 3,640 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by three yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that there were transactions at 3,645 yuan after the close. The whole day fluctuated by 85 yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there was little trading.

### Jewelry Gold Results Were Neutral

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was still 370 yuan at major dealers. At 9:30, it was raised by five yuan. After a moment, it suddenly fell by 10 yuan. At 12:03, it rebounded by five yuan. After that, there were no changes. As a result, there were no gains or losses. The major dealers still had it at 370 yuan, and new dealers had it at 368 yuan. The price for buying it back was reduced by 10 yuan or so.

### Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged

According to a London telegram on the 31st, the price of British pure gold remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pence per ounce, which caused the central bank's purchase price for Chinese cash to remain stable at 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold also remained flat, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price was also still at 1107.09 jiao.

### US Dollars and Pounds Rise by Three Yuan; Demand for British Gold Notes Is Also Strong

Yesterday, the prices of British and American gold pounds rebounded due to the high opening price of spot gold. Although the spot gold market weakened in the evening, the prices remained firm due to the scarcity of supply. The demand for British gold notes was strong, and the price continued to rise due to the lack of supply in the market. The supply of US dollar notes was smooth due to the easing of foreign exchange, and the market saw a slight decline. The prices of Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, and Annam notes were relatively high due to the large number of people going to the southwest. The price of Japanese gold notes fell daily, and it was 1.05 yuan in the evening market. The supply of Korean notes was scarce, and the market was slightly firm, at 8 jiao and 8 fen in the evening market. No public association transactions were made. Yesterday's market prices: British pound rose by one yuan, British gold notes rose by three jiao, US gold pound rose by one jiao, US dollar notes fell by 0.25 jiao, Hong Kong notes rose by 2 fen, French franc notes rose by 1 li, Annam notes rose by 5 fen, and the prices of other currencies were unchanged.

### Demand for Cash Decreases; Discount Rates Plunge

--60 Yuan--

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange and drafts fell sharply. The discount rate per thousand yuan has broken into the 200 yuan mark. This is because China's financial situation has stabilized, and the craze for grabbing foreign exchange and buying gold has subsided, resulting in a sharp decrease in the demand for cash. In the early morning, it was still around 220 yuan, but then it retreated by 20 yuan due to the surge in the supply of cash. At noon, it was 200 yuan. After breaking into 200 yuan in the afternoon, it could not be sustained and plunged straight down. Finally, it hit a low of 160 yuan, which was down 60 yuan compared to the final price of the previous day. The Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged, at 2 jiao for both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Stamps Used as Change; 120 Fen per Yuan

Since the general use of stamps as change, they become invalid once they are damaged. Citizens are hoping for fractional currency notes, and they have been "necking like gourds" waiting for them. However, the newspapers are constantly promoting when they will arrive and when they will be available. It can be said that they have done their utmost to promote them, but it is only "hearing the sound of footsteps but not seeing anyone come down." As a result, fractional transactions can only be done with stamps. The stamps stored by stores cannot all be found, so there is a method of selling them in whole sheets. Currently, one yuan can be exchanged for 110 fen or even 120 fen, but refusals are also common.

### City Market Increases Hard Currency: 9 Million Yuan

The Silver Money Trade Association of this city, due to the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram announcement regarding the regulation of funds among members and to facilitate the payment of legal tender deposits of 500 yuan or less, consulted with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to standardize the total amount of exchange deposits held by member institutions in the Silver Money Treasury as of the end of June, totaling 22 million yuan, which was converted into legal tender at 95% of face value and withdrawn in twelve weekly installments, entrusted to the Bank Reserve Committee for handling. Payments began on July 4th, with July 4th being the first installment, July 11th the second, July 18th the third, July 25th the fourth, and yesterday (August 1st) the fifth installment payment date. Yesterday, silver money businesses went to the Reserve Committee to complete payment procedures. Some withdrew hard currency, while others transferred funds into their legal tender current accounts with the committee, resulting in a total increase of 1.8 million yuan in legal tender reserves for the industry. Over the five installments, the silver money industry has increased circulating legal tender by 9 million yuan. The recent sharp drop in rediscount rates is undoubtedly related to this. The sixth installment is scheduled for payment on the 8th (next Tuesday). (Eagle)

### Silver Bar Continues to Rise

London dispatch, July 31st: The silver market saw Indian buying and short covering, but American firms sold, leaving the market balanced. Prices remained steady after closing, to the satisfaction of buyers. Large silver bars rose 0.0625 for near-term delivery and 0.125 for forward delivery. New York silver dispatch: American spot prices remained stable. Bombay silver dispatch: The Indian silver market was stable, spot prices rose 2 annas, and futures rose 3 annas. A total of 100 contracts were traded.

### Securities: Internal Debt is Key, More Critical Than the Situation

In the over-the-counter securities market yesterday, trading was conducted with the seventh coupon already accounted for. Opening prices differed from the previous day's prices, including interest, by 2.12 yuan, suggesting solid market prices. The range of price fluctuations was narrow, limited to increases or decreases of only 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. Since June 19th, the interest issue has caused widespread commotion. This can now be considered resolved. The seventh coupon's principal and interest can now be concluded. The government has effectively ceased payment, with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications doing their best to temporarily advance exchange drafts to maintain the market. How to handle the eighth coupon's principal and interest is another issue, so this decision cannot be considered a precedent. Regarding the environment, the Sino-British, Sino-Japanese, and European issues are gradually becoming more serious. Counterfeit currency is spreading rapidly. The Anglo-Japanese problem has reached a critical juncture. The European situation is complex and tense. With storm clouds gathering, public debt market prices fluctuate accordingly. Previously, the principal and interest issues were key, but now the focus will shift to the political situation. Yesterday's trading was unusually quiet, with buying and selling showing no enthusiasm. Sellers were Tiansheng Songmao and Fuchun, and buyers were Lianyi Hongkang and No. 31. Activity was very slow, mainly short-term speculative trades, resulting in a transaction volume of only over 200,000 yuan. All bonds were ex-interest. Newly made gains and losses are not listed. Below are the high, low, and closing prices. London foreign debt prices remained unchanged.

In stock trading, 40 shares of Chinese-owned electrical company stock were traded at a price of 5.3 yuan. According to a report from the Public Chamber of Commerce, although the price of rubber raw materials in New York rose and the local foreign exchange market was stable, yesterday's trading was very quiet. Industrial and rubber stocks saw little change.

The London branch of the British-owned Far Eastern Company's stock market listings for July 31st (Monday) showed that the HSBC stock price was listed at a new price after deduction of interest. London-registered shares were £75, and Hong Kong-registered shares were £77. Mercantile Bank rose 5 shillings to £6 17s 6d. The coal mine stock price from last Friday's telegram was incorrect. The Kailan Mining Administration stock price should have been 15s 6d. Korean coal mine stock remained unchanged at 4s 9d. Kulakkalam Rubber rose 6 pence to 18 shillings. There were no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Frenzied Stockpiling, Cotton Yarn Prices Soar, Texchem Sets a Record High of 675 Yuan, Even Cold Stock Rises by 20 Yuan

The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend was particularly pronounced and rapid. Due to rumors circulating in the market, sentiment turned bullish. Although the foreign exchange and gold markets remained stable, speculators' desire to hoard cotton yarn resurfaced. Buyers rushed in, and the market moved forward vigorously. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose to 588 yuan, only 7 yuan lower than the previous peak. The price of 20-count Texchem, however, rose fearsomely, rising for three consecutive days by a total of 55 yuan, closing at 675 yuan, setting a new record in the history of the yarn industry. Despite the soaring prices, hoarders not only refused to sell their existing yarn but continued to buy and store it deeply.

The yarn market opened extremely strong in the morning. Most market participants were buying, creating a sense of panic. Rumors circulated, intensifying the buying frenzy and driving prices higher. Spot prices for 20-count Bianma yarn from foreign firms opened at 571 yuan, and warehouse order prices were 555 yuan. Prices then rose rapidly. Spot prices for Double Horse yarn closed at 588 yuan, and warehouse order prices were 572 yuan. Statistics show that various firms bought a total of 1,380 bales in the morning, plus 210 bales traded in the afternoon of the previous day. Prices for 20-count Double Horse rose 22 yuan, Texchem rose 25 yuan, Mutton Brand rose 13.5 yuan, and cold stocks also rose 20 yuan. Today, 25 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below:

Hong Kong: 410  Mainland: 175

Traders: 735 Tianjin: 50

Total: 1,380

The Japanese yarn market also soared. The reasons for this are unclear. The price of 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month is said to be 460 yuan.

Another report states that in the cotton yarn market, for the same count and grade of cotton yarn produced by different mills, excluding unpopular new brands, prices for popular old brands can vary widely. For example, the quality of Shen Er's 20-count Tiannv yarn and Shen Jiu's 20-count Double Horse yarn, in terms of thread evenness, color, and tensile strength, is not inferior to Double Horse yarn. Why is Tiannv yarn always 17 or 18 yuan or even 25 or 26 yuan cheaper than Double Horse yarn? This leaves outsiders confused, especially since the selling price of Tiannv yarn once exceeded that of Double Horse yarn. There is a need to explain this situation.

According to industry insiders, the price of "Double Horse" is higher than "Tiannv" because the mill maintains close relationships with its customer firms. Sometimes, customer firms request that the mill increase production or advance delivery dates to meet shipping schedules. The mill can accommodate these requests and provide various forms of convenience to its customers. Shipping schedules can take a long time, greatly affecting sales and prices. Since customers benefit from the mill's convenience, they naturally make efforts to promote it and compete for Double Horse brand yarn in the market. Thus, the Double Horse brand enjoys great popularity and high prices. "The quality of the yarn is not particularly superior to Tiannv's."

### Indian Cotton Traders Buy and Sell: Volume Reaches 3,000 Bales

Cotton trading remained sluggish. However, buying and selling among Indian cotton traders was unusually vigorous. Most of these transactions were resold to mills. However, due to the financial emergency, mills' buying activity showed no signs of improvement. Today, transactions among traders totaled 3,000 bales, all for warehouse delivery. Prices continued to rise by 3 or 4 yuan. Supplies from northern Jiangsu decreased further. Only 28 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the docks. The current cotton situation is listed below:

Bailuo Cotton: 106.00-107.75; Bought by traders: 450 bales; Premium, warehouse delivery

Packed Cotton: 110.00; Bought by traders: 248 bales; Also, warehouse delivery

Hughes & Co: 109.25; Also, 000 bales; Also, warehouse delivery

Laigong Cotton: 120.00; Also, 200 bales; Exchange, warehouse delivery

Bailuo Cotton: 107.75; Also, 200 bales; Cash, warehouse delivery

Pingguo Cotton: 86.75; Also, 300 bales; Also, warehouse delivery

Laigong Cotton: 99.00; Also, 400 bales; Also, warehouse delivery

Hughes & Co: 136.00; Also, 200 bales; Exchange, warehouse delivery

Bailuo Cotton: 108.25; Also, 200 bales; Cash, warehouse delivery

Xinte Cotton: 85.50; Also, 300 bales; Also, warehouse delivery

Dullila Cotton: 110.00; Purchased by Japanese-Chinese mill: 200 bales; Also, Also

Another report: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was very quiet. Chinese mills had ample inventories and temporarily did not purchase. However, Japanese mills' inventories, according to reliable figures, were only sufficient for one month. Therefore, they have been absorbing spot goods from traders in the market, with payment terms delayed until late this month.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market opened strongly this morning due to favorable telegrams from Liverpool and Bombay, with prices rising 3-5 points. Traders and overseas cotton merchants actively bought in the market. Due to the firmness of prices in the southern spot market and some short covering, prices rose again. Prices closed very strongly, up 14-15 points from the previous day. Washington news: The government is concerned that the release of the pricing for the previously proposed new cotton loan program will lead to another increase in loan storage of cotton and is temporarily withholding the announcement. Yesterday, Indian cotton rose one rupee, including forecasts, and Egyptian cotton rose 10 points.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth Soars, Hoarders Active in Domestic Cloth

Domestic Cloth: Eastern cloth soared. Although domestic mills' prices are high, wholesalers' goods are cheaper than Eastern cloth.

Therefore, wholesale shops, dyeing factories, and hoarders in this street are all actively buying. Demand from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian firms is also strong. Market prices are gradually rising. As a result, light and heavy coarse cloth rose 0.25-0.5 yuan, fine cloth and fine twill rose 0.1-0.25 yuan per bolt, and serge and woolen cloth rose 0.01-0.02 yuan per yard. Dyed cloth and flannel prices also rose by 0.3-0.5 yuan. Trading was most active in this street, with over 500 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill, and dyed cloth traded. Firms from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia bought 4,000-5,000 bolts of fine twill, dyed cloth, dyed twill, and bleached cloth. Firms from Yantai and Tianjin bought over 100 pieces of serge, woolen cloth, flannel, and coarse cloth. Firms from Ningbo and Shaoxing bought over 100 bales of coarse cloth, dyed cloth, and dyed twill.

Eastern Cloth

Yesterday, the price of white fine cloth and fine twill soared by 0.7-0.8 yuan per bolt because firms from Tianjin and Zhaohuangdao in the north continued to buy. The spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose to 16.25 yuan per bolt, with this month's warehouse order at 16.5 yuan and September delivery opening at 16.7 yuan. Northern firms bought over 1,000 pieces of various brands of spot goods. Due to the sharp reduction in cash discounts for future sales, traders and dyeing factories in this street also showed strong interest, with transactions reaching 500-600 pieces. The forward price for Dragon Head fine cloth for next month was 16.75 yuan, Three Peach fine cloth 15.5 yuan, and Five Blessings fine cloth 15.75 yuan, but the volume was small and market sentiment was strong. Firms from Tianjin bought over 100 cases of Four Gentlemen serge dyed cloth. Japanese merchants were unwilling to offer more, and market prices have repeatedly increased to 0.465 yuan per yard.

On the 2nd, 15 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Food: Still Stockpiling Rice, Limits Imposed on All Goods

Local Rice: After the arrival of goods from various sources was cleared, another 2,000+ bags of cartwheel wrapped rice arrived yesterday. However, goods from the river delta have not arrived and are expected to arrive this afternoon, including 11 ships from Nangang and Songjiang, towed to Shanghai by small boats. In terms of sales, after a previous decline, shops in this street showed renewed interest yesterday, and hoarders also took the opportunity to buy, tightening the situation. All goods rose in price. As a result, the prices of thick and thin Japonica rice reached their limit, and the price of Du Yang Jian rice also increased by varying amounts of 0.3-0.4 yuan. The prices of Bianwu rice were inactive, and the market was stable. Wuxi Su Geng rice was priced at 20 yuan, Songjiang wrapped thin rice at 20 yuan, Hu Jian rice at 19.7 yuan, Yang Jian rice at 19.3-19.4 yuan, Du Jian rice at 18.8 yuan, Wu Jian rice at 16 yuan, Su Re rice at 15.6 yuan, Bian Jian rice at 15.4 yuan, and Bian Yuan rice at 21.5-21 yuan. Total transactions were over 4,300 bags.

Customer Xian Rice: Rumors of the origin opening up have repeatedly circulated in the market. However, no telegrams have been received as of yesterday. As shops in this street and retail customers actively bought, prices rose again. The selling price of Ji Shao rough rice, below the market price, rose by 0.2-0.4 yuan to the 16 yuan limit. Buying and selling were both active. Total transactions for the day exceeded 4,000 bags.

### Active Sales, Restrictions Still Imposed on Bulk Sales, Wheat Market Improving

The current flour market sales continued to be active, with both northern and southern firms placing orders. Retail sales in this street and inland areas also continued to be brisk. Therefore, the market remained firm. Due to the high price of imported wheat raw materials and the bullish market for local wheat, factories continued to restrict bulk sales to customers and hoarders. The amount of reclaimed goods in the market has dried up, and sellers were unwilling to sell cheaply. The total volume of this week's transactions was close to 40,000 bags. The price from No. 2 flour mill was uniformly 5 yuan in cash. It is reported that the selling price of reclaimed goods was 0.05-0.1 yuan higher than the mill price.

The supply of new wheat continued to increase. In addition to the continued arrival of wheat from Jiangsu, Kunshan, Beijing, and Zhenjiang, wheat from Guandian and Wuyi also arrived in succession. Since Chinese mills officially purchased new wheat the day before, hoarders became more active in acquiring it, pushing the market into a better position. Yesterday, Fuxin Mill continued to buy 2,000 bags, and hoarders in this street bought over 3,000 bags. The price of Suzhou high wheat was 6.9 yuan, Kunshan 6.88 yuan, Changzhou 6.76 yuan, and wheat from Puzhen, Danyang, and Wuyi was 6.57-6.53 yuan. The market was firm.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Raw Peanuts Short, Prices Rise Again

Raw Peanuts: Due to the recent shortage of supplies, prices have risen repeatedly. With no new supplies arriving, the total number of cases sold to the market was ten. With the risk of running out of stock, the selling price of raw peanuts at Da Yang Zhuang rose another 5 yuan yesterday, reaching 30 yuan.

Among miscellaneous grains, 235 bags of beans will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: Imported Sugar Relaxes

Yesterday, according to overseas telegrams, the sugar market saw no changes. With the guild's assigned prices and soft demand, the spot price of 24th grade coarse white sugar fell by 0.6 yuan to 33.4 yuan at this warehouse and 33.3 yuan at foreign warehouses. Re-export sugar fell by 0.5 yuan to 25 yuan. Taikoo granulated white sugar also fell slightly by 0.2 yuan, with West Warehouse B mark at 38.4 yuan, CW mark at 38.1 yuan, CH mark at 37.8 yuan, DY mark at 37.4 yuan, and HX mark at 37.2 yuan. H mark crude red sugar fell slightly by 0.5 yuan to 22 yuan. Dutch red spot sugar fell slightly by 0.1 yuan to 29 yuan, and re-export sugar fell to 21.2 yuan. There were no other major changes. Domestic sugar prices eased with the reduction in discounts, and the market was slightly stable. Only 60+ bags of Huanggang Qing sugar were sold at 26.8 yuan, with no other transactions. Also, 18,000 bags of sugar arrived yesterday.

### Seafood: Siamese Light Vegetables Available

-Price Up 10 Yuan From Before-

Siamese dried mussels: This year's production was not abundant, so deliveries have been scarce for a long time. There are still accumulated stocks here, barely sufficient for sales. However, due to foreign exchange rates, sourcing new supplies is difficult. Yesterday, sales of medium-quality dried mussels opened at a cash price of 88 yuan, up 10 yuan from before.

### Coal: Indian Bituminous Coal, Industries Manipulate Prices Upward

Indian Bituminous Coal: Although the orders placed by various industries last month reached 20,000+ tons, the market was not relaxed but maintained high prices. The price of lump coal has risen to 70 yuan per ton, up a total of 30 yuan. Retail shops in this street had to buy at market prices to meet demand. Retail sales at the store level were 9 yuan per basket, barely enough to make a profit.

### Metals: New Steel Plates Sought After in Tianjin

The new steel plate market price is high due to over demand. Yesterday, Tianjin firms, due to demand, approved the batch purchase of hundreds of dan from traders in this street for shipment when there are suitable ships. Local shipyards and machinery factories are also purchasing slightly. The price is around 10 yuan higher than before. The current market price for 2.5 fen is 42 yuan, 5 and 7.5 fen are priced at 35 yuan, 10 fen is sold at 28 yuan, and 15 fen and up to patterned types are priced at around 25 yuan.

### Shanghai Q&A (2)

After a moment of silence, the Westerner asked again: "Strange! Neither for practice nor for spectacle, for what purpose is it established? Truly incomprehensible." The answer: "These people rent land to trade." The Westerner said: "Does your honorable gateway allow others to rent? Who dares to rent out the country's city gate? Do officials greed for such petty profits?" The answer: "This is not the intention of the authorities." The Westerner said:

"Why do the authorities not prohibit it?" The answer: "Difficult to say! According to regulations, building houses within the city walls is prohibited. Last year, building houses was almost universal. The authorities discovered it and ordered all to be demolished, but it took several months to demolish only half. When building, it was completed in a few days, but when demolishing, it was so slow. The execution of orders cannot match the incentive of profit. The Westerner said: "Surely there is no way to remedy this, allowing it to accumulate and crowd. After a long time, those who want to visit Shanghai will not be able to enter." The answer: "Perhaps there is a profound intention to obstruct people. We ordinary people cannot know. You are foreigners. Why must you be so verbose? As the saying goes: 'Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, don't mind the frost on other people's roofs.' Please remember these words." The Westerner said: "Alas! Since you said 'Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door,' why does your country's city gate not manage itself? Now, the barbican is a strategic and vital place for defense. A glasses shop has suddenly opened in the barbican of the new North Gate, and a dried tofu shop and a pipe stall have opened at the small East Gate, and a bookstore and cloth shop at the large East Gate. Allowing people to live in such vital locations, who will bear the responsibility if there are unexpected accidents?" Will be published tomorrow: Catching freeloaders

Chronicles

### Pugachev

- Yan Hua

(1)

After watching "Pugachev," one immediately thinks of "Chapayev." One was the leader of the revolution in the era of serfdom, and the other was the leader of a guerrilla force later organized into a formal Red Army to fight the White Russian forces. Although the methods are different and the times are different, the spirit of resistance and revolutionary fervor are exactly the same.

But why did "Pugachev" end in a terrible defeat, while "Chapayev" became one of the strongest military leaders of the Red Army, capable of utilizing guerrilla warfare? As Lenin said:

"At that time, the peasants were still very ignorant. They could not unite, and they had no helpers or brothers among the urban workers, but the peasants still fought as they could and as they were able. The peasants were not afraid of the government's barbaric reprisals, they were not afraid of whippings, they were not afraid of bullets."

However, the peasant revolution (1773-1774) did not bring about a new system or new methods of production. Moreover, the soldiers who had just been freed from serfdom had very vague ideas about revolution and political consciousness. At that time, their only demand, as Stalin said, was that they opposed the landlords and simply hoped for a "good emperor."

"Pugachev"—this "hero of the marshes" circulating among the Russian people—finally led 600,000 serfs in a grand and vigorous struggle in the history of the Russian revolution. Although this revolution against landlords encountered serious setbacks, the Russian peasants had already been imbued with revolutionary blood.

While Soviet film studios were producing a large number of historical films, we in Shanghai saw "Peter the Great" and this film "Pugachev."

"Peter the Great" was the starting point for the revitalization of Russia. Thanks to his efforts, the new Russia emerged later. What lessons can "Pugachev" give us?

This "hero of the marshes," his tragic failure, and the participation of 600,000 serfs in this struggle, provide much to learn for China in the midst of resistance:

(1) Pugachev left his family, wife, and children to lead this struggle;

(2) When he discovered that some of his revolutionary comrades were betraying him, he generously forgave them, saying that now was not the time for settling scores, but rather a time when everyone should work together;

(3) Pugachev was not only a brave and decisive revolutionary leader, but he was also clear about the difference between enemies and friends. After the Bashkir people joined forces with Pugachev to resist the oppression of the Tsar, there was a brief misunderstanding, but Pugachev used the utmost sincerity to make the Bashkir people shake hands with him again.

These are Pugachev's greatest qualities, but Pugachev's failure is still plainly revealed in the film, such as the lack of organization in the army and the failure to utilize new combat methods, especially the two points mentioned above.

Therefore, history is absolutely not "antiques" moved out unchanged. We must critically accept the lessons of history through a new historical perspective.

(3)

Every scene in "Pugachev" shows the people's hatred and wavering towards the imperial family and landlords in the era of serfdom. Not only commoners, but also the so-called imperial army, were unwilling to serve the imperial family.

The script strongly grasps the resentment of the serfs and prisoners and the hot and joyful state of the spreading revolution. The cheers of the serfs and the loud laughter of the peasant soldiers when reviewing the imperial army prisoners are deeply moving. The director, Petrov, not only grasps these aspects tightly, but also writes about human relationships, the emotions of war, and the atmosphere appropriately. Pugachev's separation from his wife, the battle scene of the attack on Kazan, and after Pugachev's defeat, the beacons along the winding river, the weeping of the horn, and the sad and mournful meaning, are even more directly touching.

I believe that Bedov is a good director.

But there are naturally shortcomings in the script, such as the fact that many transitions are not written sufficiently, and it is not a clever technique to use subtitles to explain a new stage.

The actor who plays Pugachev, Scurolobagadorov, is exceptionally lovable for his broad movements and strong character. Kolyugina, who plays his wife, is a rare actress for her simplicity and warmth.

### The Confession of a Gambling Den Waiter

— Xie Tianshen

Temporarily Taking Refuge in a Place of Punishment for a Living – To Those Who Envy Them, Please Seek a Path of Light

It is not to boast about the luxurious life of Zhang, a gambling den waiter, nor to promote the gambling den. To seek survival in that muddy whirlpool is truly not my wish. Because I am subjected to the constraints of my environment, it has dictated my intentions, and I serve as a waiter in a place of punishment.

The job of a gambling den waiter is coveted and envied by some unemployed or low-paid individuals. However, they have not experienced it and do not know the bitterness of being a waiter. Some even spend hundreds of dollars trying to secure a waiter position in the gambling den, but often fail to achieve their wish. My ability to secure a position in the gambling den was half due to connections and half due to bribes, which helped me to achieve my current occupation.

My daily working hours are from 1 PM to 9 PM (on duty), a total of eight hours. Every ten days, the time is changed once, from 9 PM to 5 AM the next day (off duty). This distribution of service time is a continuous cycle.

My task is to entertain the guests and senior staff in the gambling den. During working hours, my entire body is not free, and I am bound and at their beck and call. As for our remuneration, it is calculated on a daily basis. If we are absent for one day, one day's salary is deducted from the monthly salary. In addition, there is "opium money" (extra income). This additional gain comes from diligently entertaining guests at ordinary times. If gamblers develop a good impression of you, they will give you a small tip after winning, to reward your good intentions. This monthly income is sufficient to maintain a family of nine in this "rice as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cassia" era.

All employees in the gambling den are not allowed to participate in gambling in the den. This rule is established by the owner and is enforced very strictly. The owner feels that the presence of employees in the den is unsightly, neglects their duties, and if they win, it will inevitably make them even more ambitious. If they lose, it will naturally cause economic problems, the employees' misfortune, indirectly embezzling public funds or directly affecting business.

To outsiders, this kind of life and work seems very leisurely, and the salary and extra income are so abundant that they are envious. But we are busy all day for the comfort of the gamblers, and there is never a moment for you to rest peacefully.

Finally, I would like to say to my compatriots who envy us; to seek a living in this evil, filthy, immoral, and self-destructive trap is indeed not a glorious career. It is better to seek another bright and legitimate career. The reason why I seek a living in the gambling den, which is scolded by society, is only for temporary living. My confession is not only to disclose a little of our life to all sectors, but also to give a warning to the compatriots who envy our beautiful profession!

### The Sky Clears After the Rain

Chapter 14: Thousands of Homes with Fireworks, Rural Cooperation; Myriad Miles of Waves, Overseas Flight

When He Youyu heard this, she hooked her arms around Shuangyu's neck and shouted, "Good elder sister!" and kissed her endlessly. Everyone! Isn't it said that He Shuangyu and He Liyu are twins? Who is the older sister? Who is the younger sister? This question cannot be resolved now. But the custom in society is always to consider the one who comes out of the womb first to be the elder and the one who comes out of the womb later to be the younger. It turned out that Shuangyu was born twenty minutes earlier than Youyu. Although the two babies were exactly the same, the obstetrician who delivered them had identified them clearly. Later, their mother, Mrs. He, also followed the social custom and regarded Shuangyu, who was born twenty minutes earlier, as the elder sister, and Liyu, who was born twenty minutes later, as the younger sister. When they grew up, the family did not call them Miss Senior or Miss Junior, but it was obvious that one had to be distinguished as first and the other as last, so they sometimes called each other sisters. Now Liyu saw Shuangyu say that if she were to go to the United States for inspection and to purchase machines, she was willing to let her go first, fulfilling her wish, so she was very happy. Because at this moment, going from China to the United States by plane is very convenient. From Shanghai to New York, it takes at most five days. Flying back and forth over the Pacific Ocean is not a big deal, as easy as people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang crossing Tai Lake. Originally, the international civil aviation flight across the Pacific Ocean had already begun in the autumn of 1935. At first, it departed from San Francisco in the United States and ended in Manila in the Philippines. This was just a trial flight. But it showed that no matter how much you were in the ocean, you could not stop your wings from soaring. In the spring of 1937, this route reached Hong Kong, which was considered the completion of the direct air route between China and the United States. This aviation route is more than 8,700 miles long and all of it is flying over the ocean, which is a great advance in the aviation world. That was only between San Francisco and Hong Kong, because various parts of China were troubled by the war with Japan, so even Shanghai and several other major trading ports could not fly civil aviation directly. It was not until after the war was settled that Pan American's giant aircraft could come to Shanghai. At that time, China's international air flights were well-connected. In addition to the Pan American Company's Pacific giant planes, which came to the Far East every week, there were also the British Imperial Airways, such as the China-Burma line, the China-Siam line, the China-India line, and the China-Singapore line (China to Singapore), which were all open. As for the China-Vietnam line, which was operated by Air France, flying directly from Kunming to Hanoi, it had already been completed ten years ago. And the line from Shanghai directly to Paris was also opened by Sino-French Aviation Corporation thirty years ago. (166)

Entertainment World

### The Wonderful Use of Sound Films

— De Gang

In addition to providing people with audio-visual entertainment, sound films have recently been invented in France to record many legal events. The most common is the use of sound films to record wills. The person making the will, in addition to writing it down, also reads the will aloud. The camera records the words in the will and the person making the will and other witnesses at the time, and incorporates them into the film. If there is a dispute in the future, just playing the film can solve everything, which is ten thousand times more reliable than relying solely on the will. Because documents can be forged, but there is no way to fake a film.

Recently, many city governments in France have sound film recording equipment. Whenever there are more important legal procedures that must be held in the city government, such as marriage and divorce, they are all filmed by the camera, and two copies are made, one kept in the city government and the other given to the parties for safekeeping.

This kind of film is smaller than ordinary movie films, only 16mm, and is very suitable for home screening. Therefore, after the death of their parents, if the younger generation often screens the film of their elders' last words, it is as if they are seeing the voices and faces of their ancestors again. This is very consistent with our country's ancient teaching of being cautious in mourning and pursuing the distant past.

### The Auction of Movie Star Photos is Announced

— Yin Si

Gu Lanjun's Photo for Six Thousand Gold · Chen Yunshang Ranks Second ·

The Chinese movie star photo exhibition, to sell funds for disaster relief, was held for a charity sale for eight days from the 27th of last month to yesterday. In addition to the more than 1,000 photos of celebrities from the entire film industry, there were also ten 30-inch enlarged color photos of the top ten stars for public auction.

Auction Results

Under the dual perspectives of enthusiastic disaster relief and encouragement of outstanding artists, the photos of Miss Gu Lanjun and Chen Yunshang simultaneously aroused the most intense competition. Miss Gu's photo started with a bid of 500 yuan, and the two bidders repeatedly increased the price by 1,000 or 2,000 yuan, until it reached 6,000 yuan, which was decided the night before. The results were: Gu Lanjun, first place, 6,000 yuan. (Purchased by a Dashanren from Shen Da Foreign Firm) Chen Yunshang, second place, 5,000 yuan. (Purchased by Mr. Ma from Puke Foreign Firm) Tong Yuejuan, third place, 300 yuan. (Purchased by Mr. Huo) The photos of the three ladies Jue Luming, Li Hong, and Zhou Xuan were sold for 100 yuan each. At the same time, a Dashanren gave the value to all of Gu Lanjun's photos in the entire venue and took them away. This competition can be said to be extremely fierce!

Sisters Arrive

Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the exhibition was declared over. Mr. Lin Kanghou and Miss Gu Lanjun were invited to the venue to hold the closing award ceremony. Miss Gu arrived at the meeting with her sister Miss Lijun. The sisters were dressed in blue cloth cheongsams, a pair of beauties, simple and pleasant. After Mr. Lin met her, he praised her quickly: "Great hero", "Great hero". Some people say that the proceeds from this auction are no less than 20,000 yuan, which can greatly benefit the refugees. I hope that the organizers will complete the procedures for public announcement as soon as possible.

Lin Gu's Speech

At the closing ceremony, Mr. Lin Kanghou stood up and said, "I have lived to be sixty-four years old and have never heard that a photo can be worth 6,000 yuan, but this is indeed the current fact..." The words were interesting and funny, which was very amusing. Then Miss Gu gave a thank you speech, saying in a movie-like Mandarin voice: "I am ashamed, I am too busy filming and have not done much to help the refugees; here I would like to donate 100 yuan to express my feelings..." The attitude was very generous, and the wording was also appropriate, like Miss Hu Die's style back then.

Finally, Miss Gu awarded the photos to the purchasers, took pictures, and the meeting was adjourned, thus completing this charity sale.

### Stage and Screen (Part 2)

— Xia Xia

— My Maiden Home and My Husband's Family

The play was over, and because business was good, there was a lot of surplus. Although I didn't get a penny, I got something more precious than money, that is, my confidence. This experience told me that as long as you are willing to endure hardship and work hard, there is nothing in the world that cannot be done. "Where there is a will, there is a way" has become my golden rule.

Later, I unexpectedly encountered a lot of exclusion, jealousy, bullying, slander and all kinds of intolerable blows. I thought about it for a long time, and I decided to seek another way. I didn't want to crouch at other people's feet waiting for pity, so I left the stage and jumped onto the screen, that is to say, I left my maiden's home and went to my husband's family—and had a relationship with my husband's family.

The above only tells about my relationship with the stage and the screen. Now let's talk about my current situation: Since August 13th, the entire China has taken on a new look. Everything is being reformed and everything is progressing. So when the film companies were closed last year, my maiden's family also revived with a new look after the reform, and wanted me to go back. Because of my long-standing love for the stage, and at the same time, I felt that I should also serve this group that is striving for the drama movement on this isolated island, so I forgot all the old grievances and came here without hesitation.

Later, the film companies slowly opened one after another. Xinhua Company wanted me to be a basic actor. Because I also liked my husband's family, I agreed without hesitation. However, I didn't completely leave my maiden's family like the last time. I just worked on both sides when they didn't conflict with each other, so sometimes I ran to the stage and sometimes I jumped on the screen, running around on both sides, from last year until now.

Finally, what should be said is my future hope! I feel that the acting life of Chinese actresses is really too short. If you want to engage in this kind of work for the rest of your life, it is impossible to rely solely on being an actor. Looking at the old actors who are declining and falling one after another is a very good example. So in order to implement my own ideas and regard filmmaking as a lifelong career, I have a plan to become a director. I plan to become a director when I can't be an actor, so that this lifelong career will not be interrupted halfway. Fortunately, I have always held the belief that "where there is a will, there is a way." As long as I continue to work hard and continue to learn, I think that with my obsession and confidence in filmmaking, I may not be rejected by my maiden's home and my husband's family, right?

The Difference Between Inviting Performers Now and in the Past

In the autocratic era, Confucius was exceptionally respected. Since the old master Confucius had a habit of not knowing the taste of meat for three months after hearing Shao music, his descendants also loved opera very much. Every year, some famous performers would come south from Beijing to Qufu to sing a few good operas for the little sage to enjoy. After receiving the reward, some would return to the capital, while others would go south from Qufu and then disperse to various provinces. However, the first large place to stop after leaving Qufu and heading south was our Xuzhou Prefecture. Since Xuzhou is a thoroughfare for four provinces, the commerce is naturally more prosperous, and there are several large-scale opera houses, so these good actors who were serving in the inner court were happy to stay here for a while to seek further development to the west or south. I don't remember the very distant years very well. Like the famous actors in the Lian Shengzhan and Wuchanhui opera houses in the city during the Guangxu years, such as Bai Meimao Wang Yufang, Xu Chunfa, Song Jian, and the later generation of Yidiyou, Xiao Guangzi, Tian Shuanglin, Wang Baoan, Dong Delin, Sun Chunquan, Wang Caiyun, Bolicui, Yinwawa, all these Sheng, Dan, Jing, and famous actors from Bangzi and Erhuang troupes were all exceptionally skilled and capable. Later, Mr. Yufang and his son Xiao Pang Gou (i.e. Wang Wenxiang) came to Shanghai to teach apprentices. Wenxiang also joined the troupe because Xu Chunfa was the backstage manager of the Lao Gong stage. Wang Caiyun was originally a Qinqiang Hua Dan, and his martial arts were very strong. Because of his old age and declining appearance, he changed his name to Liu Fengkui, and is now the backstage manager of a stage in this city. As for the others, they have either died or retired, and most of them have disappeared. After the Republic of China, such as Rui Debao, Liu Kuiguan, Wang Yunfang, and Wang Guanying, all of them performed in Xuzhou first and then came directly to Shanghai. Furthermore, such as Zhou Xinfang, the famous president of the Qi Society, although his ancestral home is Ningbo, he lived in Xuzhou City with his father for a long time since he was a child. It is said that Xinfang's father was originally an amateur opera performer and loved opera very much, but because of his Southern accent, his pronunciation was inaccurate and his art was mediocre, so every time he sang, he would mess it up. Zhou was angry and ordered Xinfang to enter the opera school to learn opera. Now he has become famous, which can also be considered a way for his father to be proud. (72)
