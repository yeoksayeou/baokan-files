### Extremely Rapid Advance of the Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi; Superior Situation Near Zhongtiao Mountain; One-Third of Japanese Forces Eliminated, Large Numbers of Wounded Soldiers Transported North; Japanese Troops Invading Mengyin and Yishui Under Chinese Control

(Hong Kong) Shaanxi Telegram: In the battle where the Chinese army captured Pinglu and Maojindu, the Japanese suffered nearly 1,500 casualties. The Chinese army is now advancing extremely rapidly, with Chinese forces attacking everywhere along the southern section of the Tongpu Railway. The battle situation near Zhongtiao Mountain has greatly improved. The Japanese are resisting stubbornly in Lishi and Liulin, but the Chinese army is still fiercely attacking. (Special Dispatch, 13th)

(Hong Kong) Chongqing Telegram: The Japanese army launched a multi-pronged invasion of southeastern Shandong Province. The Chinese army is now engaging in mobile guerrilla warfare, intercepting the Japanese forces everywhere. In recent days, nearly 2,000 Japanese soldiers have been annihilated near Mengyin, Yishui, and Linyi. A certain Chinese commander and others are personally directing operations on the front lines, greatly boosting morale. The Japanese troops invading Mengyin and Yishui are now under Chinese control. As of the 12th, the battles on all fronts were still fierce. (Special Dispatch, 13th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, as a result of continuous counterattacks by the Chinese army in southern Shanxi over the past three days, Maojindu and Pinglu have been completely recovered. On the western Shanxi front, Liulin and Mucun have also been recaptured. At the same time, the Japanese troops at Jun Ferry, an important Yellow River crossing, have also been cleared by the Chinese army, and ferry services on the Yellow River have resumed. After being defeated by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops in the Zhongtiao Mountain area left behind over 10,000 corpses. The main force of the Japanese army in that area has now retreated north towards Changdian. It is estimated that the Japanese military strength in this area is no more than 30,000 men, including the 20th Division, part of the 27th Division, and two artillery regiments. However, the losses suffered by the Japanese side this time have reached one-third of their forces in this area. The Zhengtai Railway is now being used entirely to transport Japanese wounded soldiers back to the north, and ordinary commercial traffic has been completely cut off, which shows the intensity of the fighting in Shanxi Province. According to a Chinese military spokesman, the reason why the Japanese troops at Jun Ferry could not hold their ground was that the main communication line between Lishi and Liulin was cut off by the Chinese army, and supplies of ammunition and reinforcements could not be delivered, forcing them to abandon the territory they had gained. In short, the main reason for the Japanese failure was that they could not maintain their rear lines of communication while advancing. The victory of the Chinese army in Shanxi Province this time can also serve as clear evidence that the guerrillas have pinned down the Japanese army, and the Japanese army no longer has the ability to advance. According to a Chinese spokesman, judging from the various Japanese documents obtained on the battlefield, at present, one out of every two soldiers fighting in China is an untrained recruit. This is because the Japanese have lost 800,000 soldiers in the war against China so far, which is the reason why the Japanese military strength is gradually weakening. (Associated Press Dispatch, 13th)

(Xi'an) When the Chinese army passed north through Pinglu, they encountered five or six hundred Japanese soldiers near Dongcun and Checun. After a courageous assault, they killed over 300 Japanese, including the Japanese company commanders Yoshii and Murata, and captured four Japanese mountain guns, one mortar, three machine guns, and a large number of rifles and military supplies. (Telegram, 13th)

(Zhengzhou) A certain Chinese unit in southern Shandong launched a fierce attack on Ge Gou Town (north of Linyi) on the 9th. The Japanese, who were entrenched in the town, resisted stubbornly. After a courageous assault by the Chinese army, the Japanese could not hold out and fled towards Tangtou. Ge Gou Town was immediately recovered. The Japanese troops who retreated from Qingqisi were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. They are now fleeing towards Douba. Zhu Mo has been recovered by the Chinese army. (Telegram, 13th)

Japanese Army in Tianjin Issues Announcement

### Announces Implementation of Traffic Restrictions in Concessions Starting at Six O'Clock This Morning; Japanese Authorities in Tianjin and Beiping Secretly Discuss Isolation Measures; U.S. Nationals Still Allowed to Import Food, Medical Supplies, and Utensils; British Side Declares It Will Take Necessary Countermeasures

Announcement Issued by Japanese Military in Tianjin

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The Japanese military and consular authorities held an emergency meeting on the night of the 10th. Takeuchi, the head of the Economic Affairs Section of the Asia Development Board, came to Tianjin from Beiping to attend the meeting. It did not end until the morning of the 11th. They made some decisions on countermeasures regarding the financial aspect after the blockade of the concessions. A spokesman for the Japanese military and the Japanese consul announced on the 12th that the blockade of the concessions would begin from that day or the 13th. All foreign commercial organizations with warehouses in the city were given until the 12th to move their inventory into the concessions, otherwise the Japanese side would not be responsible for any incidents that might occur. The U.S. Consul in Tianjin was also notified that all 450 U.S. nationals in Tianjin would still be allowed to import a considerable amount of food after the blockade, and that their supplies might even be provided by the Japanese side. The Japanese side claimed that this action was solely to deal with Britain and France. It was also stated that special passes would be issued to foreign journalists. It is reported that after learning of the above news, the British Consul-General told foreign reporters that if the Japanese blockade exceeded seven weeks, the British side would take necessary countermeasures. Furthermore, there have been no diplomatic negotiations between the Japanese and the British and French concessions here since the 12th. News has also come from Tokyo confirming that the blockade will be implemented on the 14th, so mediation efforts have been suspended. (Telegram, 13th)

(Hong Kong) According to sources on the foreign side in Tianjin, a spokesman for the Japanese Army in Tianjin declared to the press on the 12th that the Japanese Army authorities had decided to deal with the British concession in an independent manner, and that the nature of this approach was extremely serious. According to various Japanese newspapers in Tianjin, the main points of the economic blockade of the British concession were as follows: (1) Prohibiting ships from sailing to the British concession. (2) All foreign nationals entering and leaving the British concession will be inspected and their passports checked, but Britons will not be allowed to enter or leave. The French concession remains tranquil as usual, and the authorities do not appear to have taken any special measures. (Telegram, 13th)

(Tianjin) Although the Japanese have implemented preliminary measures to blockade the British and French concessions today, the British community here is responding to the increasingly serious situation with a firm resolve and without any sign of panic. The commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin issued a proclamation this afternoon, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles from passing between the Japanese concession and the Chinese area, and between the British and French concessions, starting at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow. It is claimed that this measure is being taken to curb anti-Japanese and communist activities. The blockade of Wan Guo (International) Bridge will be in effect from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight. Yamaguchi Street, Asahi Street, Biroon Street, Taiyo Street, Zhong Street, and Race Course Road will be closed from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. The proclamation also states that all pedestrians and vehicles will be searched by the Japanese authorities at seven designated locations. All ships sailing on the Bai River must dock at the Dalian Wharf near the newly built Japanese Bridge to await inspection. Violators of this proclamation will be punished according to the penalties prescribed by the Japanese Garrison Commander. According to a spokesman for the Japanese military authorities today, the blockade of the British and French concessions is the minimum necessary measure for the Japanese army to fulfill its responsibilities in the current environment. This action was triggered by the British refusal to extradite four suspects, but this is only one aspect of the matter. The Japanese proclamation this time expresses the anger of the Japanese government and public towards the British policy of "pro-Chiang." Now that the arrow has left the bowstring, the issue can no longer be resolved simply by extraditing the four suspects. If the British concession authorities do not quickly change their policy and abandon their "pro-Chiang" stance, such as protecting anti-Japanese and communist elements, sacrificing Joint Reserve Bank notes to support Chinese legal tender, monopolizing goods, condoning illegal elements' use of wireless radios, and allowing the use of anti-Japanese textbooks, and do not cooperate with Japan's efforts to build a new order in East Asia, the Japanese army will never reconcile with them. The spokesman expressed regret that the Chinese, German, American, and other foreign people in the British and French concessions would feel inconvenienced by the blockade of the concessions, and advised the residents of the above countries to withdraw from the British and French concessions. In the British concession, apart from occasional patrols by light military trucks carrying Durham Light Infantry troops along the concession boundary in recent days, it is reported that further precautions have been taken, but their nature has not yet been determined. The food situation has been investigated, and it is reported that there is an ample supply of flour. According to Japanese sources, there are currently no Japanese nationals or Japanese businesses in the British and French concessions. Branches of the Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui & Co., and the Joint Reserve Bank have all withdrawn on Sunday. The news also said that foreign residents in the British and French concessions are feeling uneasy. After the blockade is implemented tomorrow, 350,000 Chinese residents and foreigners of various nationalities will be trapped in the two concessions. Foreigners are trying to keep their Chinese servants within the concessions, but many have resigned and left. Prices in the British and French concessions have risen by 20 percent. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

(Tianjin) When the Japanese military authorities received reporters this afternoon, they issued a lengthy announcement declaring that traffic restrictions would be implemented in the British and French concessions and the areas of the Kun Shu (Italian concession) starting at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow, but the exact nature of these restrictions has not yet been disclosed. The announcement stated briefly that "patience has its limits. Now we have endured what can be endured. For the sake of maintaining peace and order in North China and for self-defense, we have decided to take necessary measures." It cited the killing of three Japanese soldiers in Tianjin by Chinese terrorists in March and April, and the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the new customs superintendent and former manager of the Federal Reserve Bank, in a theater in the British concession on April 9. The announcement detailed the diplomatic negotiations regarding the extradition of the four assassins, and stated that the crimes of the suspects had been thoroughly investigated by the Japanese side and confirmed by a certain representative of the British authorities who participated in the investigation, but the British side refused to hand them over. It is now useless to continue negotiations with the British side on this matter. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee considered the difficult situation in Tianjin at a meeting held at 10 Downing Street today, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)

(Beiping) Judging from the situation, the Japanese authorities in Beiping and Tianjin, who strongly accuse the British and French concessions in Tianjin of being a "den of anti-Japanese terrorism," seem to have intensified their attitude towards the concessions. The Japanese Consul-General, Tashiro, and a Japanese military commander came here from Tianjin last night and secretly discussed with Japanese military leaders and Horinouchi, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy, ​​this morning. It is said that they discussed the "isolation" measures against the British and French concessions, which will be implemented from Wednesday. Well-informed sources believe that since the British side refused to hand over the murderers of Cheng Xigeng, the Japanese authorities' attitude towards the British and French concessions has become increasingly tough and unwilling to compromise. It is now believed that the result of this "isolation" will be a de facto blockade of the two concessions. It is reported that Japanese official circles regard the British action as "an uncompromising attitude and a demonstration of obstructing the Japanese efforts to establish a new order in East Asia." (Reuters Telegram, 13th)

British Public Opinion Greatly Indignant

London: The Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin and the threat to the life of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to China, have attracted widespread attention here. Most newspapers are carrying news reports of this kind under large headlines. The diplomatic correspondent of The Times said that the Tianjin crisis is the worst situation that Britain has encountered in the Sino-Japanese War. Cables have been exchanged incessantly between the British government and the British ambassador to China and the British Consul-General in Shanghai over the past week. Sir Robert Craigie, the British ambassador to Japan, is also cooperating in an effort to find a way to mediate the current situation. However, at present, the Japanese side will not consider anything unless the British side accepts its demands. Powerful circles in London are now exerting strong pressure on the government to take concrete action to protect British interests in China. When the House of Commons meets tomorrow, Lord Airlie's appeal in the House of Lords yesterday, advocating a ban on Japanese ships entering the ports of Singapore and Penang, will be raised again. It is reported that a powerful delegation will visit Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler tomorrow to discuss everything, especially to urge the implementation of consular certificates for exports from China, to strengthen the defenses of the British forces in Shanghai, and to implement other plans as necessary according to the circumstances. Responsible sources say that in recent months, British public opinion towards Japan has hardened considerably, and even newspapers that have traditionally been pro-Japanese have changed their attitude. The government's answer in the House of Commons that "this matter is currently being negotiated with Tokyo" only elicits ridicule. All quarters are now earnestly claiming that the Japanese military's infringement on British rights is increasing, and it will not stop unless Britain makes it clear that it is prepared to take retaliatory action. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)

Britain is Seeking Ways to Resolve the Situation

London: Reuters has learned that the British government has recently suggested to Japan that a committee be formed with one Briton, one Japanese, and one national from a neutral country, with the national from a neutral country as chairman, to determine whether the four Chinese demanded by the Japanese side in Tianjin are guilty and should be extradited. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)

(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the News Chronicle, Bartlett, has learned that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has recently warned the Japanese government of the danger of a British-Japanese conflict in Tianjin. In Bartlett's opinion, the deadlock caused by the British refusal to hand over the four Chinese in the British concession could be resolved by a committee composed of an equal number of British and Japanese representatives, with a national from a neutral country as chairman. This committee could investigate all the evidence and decide whether the Chinese should be handed over to the Japanese side. If these suggestions are rejected by the Japanese side, a very serious crisis may occur. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)

(London) Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Tianjin situation that the Japanese side believed that the British reply was unsatisfactory and had now taken measures to isolate the concession. Although the current situation is serious, negotiations are still in progress and it is hoped that a solution can be agreed upon. Butler continued that the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the former Federal Reserve Bank manager and newly appointed customs superintendent, inside the British concession on April 9 was the first act of violence in the British concession since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The perpetrator was a Chinese who escaped on the spot. The Public Works Department immediately requested the cooperation of the Japanese side and carried out several searches within the concession. As a result, several people were arrested. The Japanese side identified these four people as members of a terrorist group related to the assassination. These four people were handed over to the Japanese side for interrogation and confessed that they had been involved in the assassination, but later, when they were returned to the British concession Public Works Department for detention, they recanted their confessions. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)

London Newspapers Consider the Situation Thorny

London: The current situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been commented on by various newspapers here, all expressing anxiety. The Times stated, "The Japanese garrison in Tianjin has placed Britain in a thorny situation, unseen since the outbreak of war between China and Japan. The British concession in Tianjin has 3,000 British nationals, 2,000 residents of other countries, and 45,000 Chinese residents. If a solution is not reached in time, the entire British concession will be blockaded, at which time trade with the outside world will be completely stopped, and no goods other than food will be able to be transported into the concession. The Japanese side has made full preparations for the blockade. Army units have set up posts in many places on the orders of the commander of the North China Garrison Army. At the same time, the British concession authorities have also taken various measures to guard against it. The origin of the matter is that the Japanese military authorities demanded the extradition of four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case, but this was rejected by the British concession authorities. These Chinese are still being detained by the British concession authorities. The British government is unwilling to allow their extradition until it obtains conclusive evidence proving their guilt." The Liberal News Chronicle stated that this matter could be resolved by a joint committee composed of an equal number of British and Japanese people. This committee should have a national from a neutral country as its chairman. (Havas Agency Telegram, 13th)

Berlin Newspapers Support Japan

Berlin: The situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been published by various evening newspapers under large headlines. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated that the current concession system in China should be completely revised. The National Socialist Party organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, stated, "The situation in Tianjin is gradually developing, and Japan is fighting against foreign interference." The newspaper also published a dispatch from a correspondent in Shanghai stating, "Japan's demands are bound to be adhered to to the end. It should be known that after the Axis powers of Germany and Italy have increased their position in Europe, the situation in the Far East will inevitably be affected." (Havas Telegram, 12th)

Editorial

### The Clarity of British Diplomacy

In his important speech to the British Parliament the day before yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax elucidated Britain's current foreign policy. As reported in today's newspapers, his statements were grounded in reality, his arguments were detailed and clear, his scope was broad, and the issues involved were of great importance. Every attitude he expressed towards every matter was extremely candid, leaving no room for "misunderstanding," and extremely firm, showing that it could not be swayed. The function of a foreign policy speech must have its maximum limit, and Lord Halifax's speech the day before yesterday should achieve the maximum effect. If it fails to clarify confusion or contribute to the difficulties of the time, then there must be factors other than diplomacy that weaken its due function.

British diplomacy has historically enjoyed a high reputation. Although judged by human civilization or weighed against the principles of communal justice, it will receive vastly different evaluations depending on the time and circumstances, especially due to its tendency to treat everything as expendable, which is often criticized by commentators. However, its self-serving calculations are truly superior, as commonly acknowledged by historians and not merely the opinion of a single party. In the past two years or so, Chamberlain has been in power. Although nearly twenty years have passed since the European War, the scars remain fresh and the lingering fears have not dissipated. Furthermore, the economic panics of recent years have made those bearing the heavy responsibility of national affairs feel as if they are treading on thin ice. At the same time, a violent atmosphere has permeated Europe and Asia, the international order and moral principles are riddled with holes, and the destructive forces secretly accumulated by those who destroy order and morality are rapidly surpassing the strength of Britain and its allies. Therefore, British diplomacy under Chamberlain has almost completely undermined its historical reputation. Its traditional diplomatic style, which was once able to navigate with ease, now leads to mistakes at every turn. First, it is cautious about self-preservation and fails to fully trust and support even its allies, resulting in alienation. Second, it seeks to befriend the strong and violent, but is seen by them as easy to manipulate, leading to deception and insult. Third, it disregards the weak and small, or offers occasional sympathy but fails to follow through; or it feigns cooperation but is not trusted by the weak and small; or it even sacrifices them. In short, British diplomacy a few months ago was vacillating, counterproductive, hesitant, isolated, and忍氣吞聲(swallowing insults) to the point of being unable to preserve itself. The facts are all vividly before us, without the need for further elaboration. It was not until the fall of Czechoslovakia that it began to change and enter a new phase.

Since the new phase did not begin today, why emphasize Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's speech the day before yesterday so strongly? Did Lord Halifax's long-winded speech the day before yesterday contain new meaning or new suggestions? No, it did not. For example, the key points of (1) not allowing unilateral alteration of existing treaties in the Far East, (2) defending British rights and commerce in China with all its strength, (3) not withdrawing troops from Shanghai, and (4) not accepting Japanese sophistry have all been repeatedly stated by Britain. However, there are aspects that should be viewed separately. In the negotiations for the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, British propaganda often claimed that it did not involve the Far East, which can only be seen as showing favor to Japan. Regardless of how the recipient views such overtures, the onlookers are skeptical. Foreign Secretary's speech yesterday can correct the misunderstandings caused by showing favor. In terms of the internal situation of the three-nation negotiations, Britain made every effort to compromise, while the Soviet Union stubbornly demanded much. In terms of the environment, aggressor nations sowed discord from the outside, and the lingering poison of appeasement threatened to stir from within. With such complex machinations, it was easy to overturn the situation. And the British Foreign Secretary's speech the day before yesterday shows that the Soviet Union's attitude is not enough to affect Britain's attitude in the Far East. The Japanese side's propaganda attacks and factual threats against Britain are increasing. Considering Britain's shrinking and cowardly behavior over the past few years, or in light of the intensity of Japan's attacks and threats, it is likely to take a calculated risk of compromising and preserving itself. The British Foreign Secretary's speech the day before yesterday is a clear response to Japan's intentions and actions. Britain's international credibility needs to be restored after the recent international turmoil, and its prestige needs to be restored. Now that it is training its troops and its strength is sufficient to restore its prestige, it has once again received the Foreign Secretary's detailed and firm statement. Who would doubt that Britain's diplomatic attitude is still obscure and ambiguous? Therefore, although the new stage of British diplomacy did not begin today, the proof of the clarity of this new stage lies in yesterday's events.

In addition to Halifax's speech, what is sufficient to highlight Britain's diplomatic attitude is the positive speeches made in the British Parliament the day before yesterday by Lord Cecil and Lord Elibank, one after another, for the Far East, as well as the questions raised by members of the House of Commons, such as Hana and Roberts. All these symbolize the atmosphere of the British Parliament, which is no longer as gloomy as it was in the past. The presence of a robust and clear atmosphere in the original Parliament is an important foundation for the establishment of policies in a democratic country. This is worthy of mention, even below the Foreign Secretary's speech.

### He Yingqin Reports on Recent Battle Situation — During the Weekly Memorial Service for the Premier — Heavy Casualties Inflicted on Japanese Troops, Cash Reserves Almost Exhausted, War-Weariness Increasing Daily, China Can Achieve Final Victory

(Chongqing) Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin reported on the recent battle situation during yesterday's weekly memorial service for the Premier, stating that the collapse of the Japanese army is occurring rather quickly, and China is increasingly confident of achieving final victory. According to General He, nearly two years have passed since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The number of Japanese casualties is estimated to be around 864,500. In April and May of this year, the Chinese army launched simultaneous counter-offensives on all fronts, and the Japanese losses were even greater than before. In total, 105,737 Japanese soldiers were killed at that time. General He stated that this number is based on detailed written reports from Chinese generals, showing that the Japanese army has almost exhausted its offensive capabilities. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese army feels that it lacks the strength to continue advancing westward. General He stated that in April and May, the Chinese army captured 1,554 Japanese and puppet soldiers alive, shot down 36 Japanese aircraft, and recaptured 104 towns. "From the past two months of combat experience, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) The morale of the Japanese army is weaker than before; (2) Once the Japanese army leaves the transportation lines, its mobility is sharply reduced, and the difficulty of obtaining supplies increases; (3) The number of Japanese casualties is too high, making replenishment difficult; (4) Due to the uncertainty of the war's objectives, the extension of transportation lines, and the endless nature of the war, the war-weariness and anti-war sentiment within the Japanese army continue to increase; (5) The Japanese army's cash reserves are being depleted due to the huge military expenditures. Within Japan, they are unable to absorb the government's bond issues, and the Japanese economic structure is collapsing. Japan's natural resources have been exhausted. All of these factors have a significant impact on the Japanese people, who are struggling to survive. Their war-weariness and anti-war sentiment are increasing daily and are already manifesting in action. Therefore, the Japanese now feel unable to cope with the current environment. Finally, the Japanese should realize that it is impossible to achieve a quick victory within their ideal timeframe." General He indicated that the Chinese side has increased its combat strength in terms of the number of troops. "After each battle ends, the army is reorganized. Improvements have gradually been made in weapons, food supply, transportation equipment, intelligence, medicine, and other aspects. For example, military academies and army training camps are working hard to train a large number of outstanding officers." The Chinese authorities are smoothly carrying out conscription in all provinces according to quotas. In addition, there is a very enthusiastic response from those who voluntarily join the army. This shows that the people's sense of national consciousness is increasing, and their hatred of Japan is deepening. Chinese guerrilla forces are demonstrating their abilities behind Japanese lines, such as assisting regular troops to contain the main force of the Japanese army and exchanging significant casualties and ammunition losses for the enemy through harassing attacks. In the future, our regular army and guerrilla forces should cooperate with each other to launch continuous attacks on the enemy in all locations, so as to prevent the Japanese from developing the economy in the occupied areas. At the same time, all comrades and the people must, under the leadership of the Kuomintang and the government, devote themselves to production and construction. We must have a unified national policy so that the government can obtain various resources during the war and gradually reduce reliance on foreign countries. The day of our country's final victory will be the day of the completion of the construction of a true nation. Regarding the bombing of Chinese cities far from the front lines by Japanese aircraft, General He criticized, "This type of bombing shows the failure of the Japanese army's attacks on the front lines. They want to shake people's hearts through bombing. They hope to destroy various construction plans through this, but their evil plans have all failed. Under the Japanese policy of terror and massacre, our determination to avenge our dead relatives, wash away national humiliation, and sacrifice our personal lives for the country has been strengthened. They do not hesitate or pause for a moment in their construction efforts because of Japanese bombing. This new rationality is a major step forward in the construction of people's hearts. During the Sino-Japanese War, this progress must be maintained until our side achieves final victory." (American Associated Press dispatch, 13th)

British Ship Folshan Prepares to Sail to Hong Kong

(Guangzhou) The British ship Folshan was originally scheduled by the British and Japanese authorities to sail from here to Hong Kong on June 8, but it did not happen due to some reason. It has now been decided that it will sail from Guangzhou to Hong Kong with passengers on the 17th. Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou Okazaki told a Reuters reporter today that the British Consul has withdrawn his original interpretation of the navigation memorandum and agreed with the Japanese interpretation, that is, any Japanese ship chartered by the Japanese government, whether it is sailing on the ocean or rivers, may carry civilian passengers. Sailing to Hong Kong will be decided weekly. As a result, the Japanese side will no longer prevent the Folshan from sailing. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)

### Japan, Germany, and Italy Negotiate to Strengthen Anti-Comintern Pact, Divergent Views Remain, Germany and Japan to Conclude New Commercial Treaty

(Berlin) Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori arrived in Berlin today to discuss with Ambassador to Germany Oshima the Japanese proposal to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. Oshima has been in contact with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop repeatedly in the past few days. It is said that Germany is particularly dissatisfied with the slow progress of these negotiations, but the Japanese side believes it is relatively optimistic. The latest Japanese proposal was delivered here a week ago, but it has not yet been announced. According to消息 previously transmitted from Tokyo, the level of sacrifice that the Japanese side is willing to make is still far from what the Axis powers want. That is, the Japanese side very much wants its obligations to be limited to the Far East. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)

(Berlin) Commercial negotiations between Japan and Germany have been ongoing for more than a year, and an agreement has only recently been reached. The new commercial treaty will be initialed in Berlin this month. Currently, German trade with Japan has a surplus, with a ratio of four to one. The difference will be reduced in the future, but the future ratio is not yet known. According to the new commercial treaty, the quantity of German machinery, aircraft, and various industrial manufactured goods exported to Japan will be increased. At the same time, the quantity of natural silk, cotton, and certain goods produced in Japan exported to Germany will also be increased. However, this new commercial treaty does not apply to the occupied areas of China. A separate agreement will be drawn up. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

(Berlin) The government of "Manchukuo" recently signed a contract with the German AEG Electric Company, entrusting the company to build a power plant near the Songhua River at a very high cost. It is said that this is the largest order that the German company has received from the Far East. In addition, the governments of Japan and Mexico have also entrusted the company to build power plants. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

Japanese Influence Invades Philippine Islands

American Democratic Congressman Demands Congressional Investigation

(Washington) During yesterday's House session, Democratic Representative Alanson T. Allen requested a Congressional investigation into Japanese activities in the Philippines. According to Allen, "The evidence of Japanese aggression in the Philippines is more important than the Japanese aggression in China." Allen also pointed out that "The Japanese have illegally controlled the important industries of the Philippines and have obtained 170,000 acres of land and forests in many places. The Davao area is an independent country entirely owned by the Japanese." Allen requested the Standing Committee to conduct an immediate investigation to determine whether the United States should immediately withdraw from the Philippines or immediately take adjusted plans to deal with Japanese aggression. According to Democratic Representative Giggins, regardless of whether the Japanese are invading the Philippines, the United States should maintain jurisdiction over the Philippines before 1946 and should not withdraw from the island.

### British Textile Workers' Union Decides to Boycott Japanese Goods, Has 250,000 Members, Supports British Aid to China Association's Proposal

The Manchester Textile Workers' Union in the United Kingdom, which has 250,000 members, resolved today by its executive committee to support the British Aid to China Movement Committee and implement a boycott of Japanese goods. All Japanese goods are subject to the boycott, especially raw silk. (Havas dispatch of the 12th)

(London) During this afternoon's House of Commons session, Liberal Party MP Mendel asked, "Has there been a large increase in Japanese goods imported into the United Kingdom? Would the British people's refusal to purchase Japanese goods not greatly benefit China's resistance to Japan?" Minister of Commerce Stanley immediately replied, "The import figures for Japanese goods in 1938 have not yet been released, but based on 1937, the import volume was much lower than in 1936."

### Dutch Defense Forces Implement Reorganization to Become Wartime Forces

The Hague. The Dutch Queen yesterday announced a decree to reorganize the national defense forces, transforming the current security forces into regular army corps, the two brigades under their command into two divisions, and the independent brigade into an independent division. The artillery brigade was abolished, and the two regiments were divided into two divisions as artillery regiments. This reorganization not only transforms peacetime forces into wartime forces but also promotes cooperation between infantry and artillery. (Haitong dispatch of the 13th)

### British House of Lords Discusses Far East Situation, Foreign Secretary Says No Recognition of Unilateral Treaty Abrogation, Rumor Japanese Army to Seize Shanghai Concessions on July 7, Claim British Army to Withdraw from Shanghai Entirely Untrue

(London) The House of Lords discussed the diplomatic situation this afternoon. Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately delivered an important speech, in which he stated the general international situation and focused on the Far East. He listed the current issues and made practical statements on each one. Regarding the existing treaties in the Far East, he said that they were all freely signed by Britain and other countries, and Britain would not recognize any unilateral modifications. Regarding British rights and commerce in China, he said that they would be protected with all their strength. Regarding the British army and navy stationed in China, regarding the various actions taken by the Japanese side under the pretext of military needs that harm British rights, he said that the British government cannot accept them, and that such excuses are even more difficult to accept in places where military operations have already ceased. All of these statements were very firm. He also said, "I am well aware that the resolutions passed by the Council and General Assembly of the League of Nations have failed to meet the wishes of the Chinese representatives, but what the countries most deeply involved in the Far East problem considered practical has been done, and our country has fulfilled its accepted obligations without any sense of guilt. I am willing to let those who understand all the circumstances and can make a fair judgment judge." As for the Chinese currency issue, it is deeply and significantly related to British interests. "Britain has assisted China in maintaining a reasonable balance, which is necessary for China to maintain its economic strength. In summary, this is the most beneficial form of British aid to China." The fact that British interests in China have been subject to Japanese obstruction is "too numerous to list, which shows the wide scope of our country's interests in China." Such obstruction is deeply concerned by all parties. For example, Lord Elibank was concerned that the Japanese might seize the Shanghai International Settlement on July 7 of this year, the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, and expressed concern about the withdrawal of the British army from Shanghai. The Wang Zhang government should continue to send troops to the area. "I dare to formally inform Lord Elibank that the government is not blind to all kinds of threats, but the government has difficulties in dealing with this issue at this time, which I believe is understood. In short, the claim that the British army will withdraw from Shanghai is entirely untrue. As for the British Navy in China, Commander-in-Chief Noble has the full authority to deploy the ships as needed."

(London) During this afternoon's House of Commons session, Conservative MP Hanner asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, "The Japanese government recently declared that if its troops in Shanghai believe that their safety is threatened, it will no longer respect the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by the International Settlement. Has our government exchanged views with the governments of the United States and France on this matter?" Foreign Office official Butler immediately replied on behalf of the Prime Minister, "British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie is maintaining close contact with the French and American ambassadors on all issues that are of common concern to the United Kingdom, France, and the United States." (Havas dispatch of the 12th)

### British Parliamentarians Mostly Advocate for Maximum Aid to China, Asserting that Japan's Infringement on British Interests Warrants Retaliatory Measures by Britain

(London) During a debate on foreign affairs in the British House of Lords tonight, Lord Cecil stated, "The disputes in the ongoing war in the Far East are no different from the disputes in Europe today. I believe Lord Halifax concurs. The broad issue we must resolve is whether it is legitimate for one country to invade another in pursuit of its perceived material or political interests, and whether a country should continue its war rights over any part of a sovereign nation. This is the real question. This is what is at stake in the Far East. Japan is currently invading China, blatantly disregarding everything. This is something that certain factions in Germany must find admirable, but it is impossible in Europe today. No member of the House of Lords is without sympathy for China. If Lord Halifax would grant us a promise, not only expressing sympathy for China but also acknowledging that we should do everything within our power to help China and drive Japanese aggression out of Chinese shores, I would be delighted."

Lord Elibank, speaking next, said, "The situation in the Far East is even worse than before. The Yangtze River basin, once a major British commercial area, is now entirely blockaded. We are excluded, while the Japanese conduct business alone. The situation regarding tariffs and trade is also deteriorating daily. The Yokohama Specie Bank is creating banknotes with the same value as Chinese legal tender and forcing people to use them where possible. This action has achieved some success. Europeans must seek a livelihood. The British government should urgently find a way to ensure that all goods transported from Shanghai to British ports must have consular certificates. This can be done with a simple Order in Council. Britons residing in various parts of the East are in a state of fearful unrest due to the tyranny of Japanese naval and army personnel. The government should pay close attention to this. I believe the government should immediately send a note to the Japanese government stating that if Tianjin is blockaded, Britain will take retaliatory action and disallow Japanese ships from using Singapore and Penang to load and unload goods. This is a perfectly legal action under international law. If we do not use force, we must use some kind of action to counter Japan's interference with British commerce in China. There have been recent reports of the Japanese mistreating Britons. Such a situation in the Far East is truly unexpected. I do not know when it will end. There are now rumors that one of the two British battalions currently stationed in Shanghai will be transferred elsewhere in September. Two battalions are barely enough to safeguard the authority of the International Settlement. If one is withdrawn, the Japanese will surely see this as clear evidence of the British government's waning interest in the matter and will seize the opportunity to take over the International Settlement, as they have desired to do in Tianjin and Xiamen. From what I have heard, the Japanese desire to seize Shanghai is no mere rumor. July 7th marks the second anniversary of the war with China, and it is a dangerous date. Reducing the garrison in Shanghai is unwise; it should be strengthened. Why doesn't the government send more warships to prevent Japan's plan to seize the Shanghai Settlement? This action should be done in consultation with the French and American authorities. The Japanese seem to believe that the best way to deal with their so-called anti-Japanese movement in China is to manage the Chinese protected by foreign flags. They have started in Tianjin and Xiamen, and now they will apply it to Shanghai. If this action is realized, trade in Shanghai will be reduced to zero. The Chinese in the Settlement will leave as quickly as possible and move inland. This step of occupying Shanghai would be a fatal blow not only to Britain but also to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The government should quickly find a way, lest it be too late." Lord Davies stated, "Empty words of sympathy for China are worthless. Providing small loans and allowing arms shipments to China are commendable, but Lord Halifax should urge all nations to respond first to the sincere appeal recently made by the Chinese Ambassador to France, Wellington Koo, in Geneva. Currently, British policy has destroyed the British Empire's reputation for fairness and justice." Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax replied, "The war we see in the Far East is indeed related to the principle of the entire question of the right to wage war. In the past two years, the British government, in such circumstances, has considered its responsibilities, what it should do, and what actions it can actually take. The British government has sponsored the passage of numerous resolutions by the General Assembly of the League of Nations. I am well aware that these resolutions have not met the expectations of the Chinese representatives, but they have been carried out to the extent that the major powers concerned with the Far East have deemed practically possible. I would very much like to submit Britain's measures on this matter to the judgment of those who know all the circumstances and can judge the methods by which Britain fulfills its assumed obligations. Lord Davies underestimates what the government has been able to do, such as its actions regarding the Chinese currency system at the beginning of this year. This can certainly be said to be extremely related to the currency system and British interests. Britain's action was not only for the sake of China's interests, but I believe that anyone who knows the difficulties of China will agree that the most helpful way for Britain to aid China is to enable China to maintain a relative balance on which its economic strength depends. As for British interests in China, there are indeed countless instances of the poor treatment now received from the Japanese, and the extent of the danger to Britain's position in China can be seen from this. However, the British government has never been indifferent to these threats. I think Lord Elibank will understand the difficulties faced by the government. However, I can assure him that the talk of withdrawing the Shanghai garrison is completely unfounded. As for sending more warships, the Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet has full authority to move warships as he deems necessary according to the needs of the situation. I know that the Japanese military authorities use military necessity as an excuse to restrict British rights, but the British government cannot accept this excuse as a reason to destroy the rights that Britons should enjoy under solemn treaties, especially in places where military operations have ceased. We cannot allow the Japanese to unilaterally revise treaties freely concluded between us and other countries. The points raised in this debate in the House of Lords are all matters that have been repeatedly discussed with the responsible Japanese authorities. The government will continue to do its best to maintain the rights of Britons to live and operate safely in China."

### British Lower House Discusses the Situation of Chinese Legal Tender

(London) During today's meeting of the Lower House, Labour MP Bellenger asked, "The exchange rate of Chinese legal tender has fallen significantly. What is the reason for this? And has the equalization fund stopped operating?" Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, in his reply, cited a communiqué issued by Hong Kong on June 8. Mr. Bellenger then asked, "If the Chinese legal tender equalization fund does not aim to maintain the stability of Chinese legal tender, and Chinese legal tender is devalued as a result, is the fund no longer of any benefit?" Simon replied, "I do not believe that it has ceased to be of any benefit." Simon again asked Mr. Bellenger to read the communiqué issued by Hong Kong. Mr. Bellenger again asked, "Has the British part of the fund stopped operating?" Simon again cited the Hong Kong communiqué, saying that it was difficult to provide any better news than that. According to the Hong Kong communiqué to which Simon referred, which was released to Reuters by the responsible parties in Hong Kong, it explained the reasons why the Sino-British Equalization Fund Committee no longer assisted Chinese legal tender, and stated that the credit of Chinese legal tender was not shaken, but that the committee's action was temporary in nature, intending to allow the exchange rate of legal tender to reach a better economic level, so that the balance of trade could be commensurate.

### Halifax Statement: Foreign Policy Unchanged; Guarantee to Poland Clear and Concrete; Those Who Resort to Force Will Meet with Forceful Resistance

(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax declared during a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Lords today that any action that threatens Poland's independence will ignite a prairie fire, and Britain will be drawn into it. The guarantee we have given to Poland is clear and concrete. What we want to make thoroughly clear is that if force is resorted to today, those who use force will encounter forceful resistance.

Today's debate began with a speech by former Secretary of War Lord Mottistone. Mr. Mottistone acknowledged that he was a firm believer in appeasement. Lord Stonehaven, the recently appointed chairman of the Conservative Party, asked the Foreign Secretary to continue speaking about the detention of British military officer Spear by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou, saying that Mr. Spear's actions did not involve any conspiracy as alleged by the Japanese. Regardless of any suspicions the Japanese may have had, they should not have detained him even when he proved his identity. According to the interpreter Cooper's report, the Japanese treatment of Mr. Spear was still appropriate, and there is currently no reason to say that the matter cannot be resolved satisfactorily.

The Foreign Secretary later spoke about the murder of Dinggler, an employee of the Pootung Lungchang Company, saying that the facts of the case had not yet been fully investigated, but that the government had very dissatisfied views regarding the circumstances of his injury and death immediately afterward. The government had instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to lodge a protest and reserved the right to demand compensation after the facts were ascertained. (Reuters, 12th) The Foreign Secretary said that he was prepared to make concessions on colonial issues and that we had a very heavy responsibility to the natives of the areas involved. Lord Cecil, chairman of the League of Nations Association, called for the re-establishment of the broad principles of the League of Nations. Lord Davies, a colleague of Mr. Cecil, expressed dissatisfaction with the Foreign Secretary's speech on June 8, saying that it had created the impression that Britain was preparing for suspicious collusion with aggressor nations. He said, "God forbid that a second Munich should undo the goodwill and respect of the American people that the King and Queen's visit to America has won." Press tycoon Lord Rothermere said he supported the policy of appeasement, and that Germany had not yet challenged Britain's vital interests individually.

The Foreign Secretary replied that his speech on June 8 (announcing Britain's willingness to discuss Germany's or other countries' demands at a round table conference) was because the opposition party had already chosen that day to debate foreign affairs. In any case, it was difficult to say that the release of the truth was too early or too late. Regarding the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, it was both unprofitable and impossible to release details now. This had to wait for the discussions of Foreign Office official Strang in Moscow. Everything agreed with other governments would be made public. The government had not forgotten for a moment all the colonial problems raised by Lord Stonehaven just now. At the present stage, he did not want to say anything further about this. Regarding the Danzig issue, if serious and dangerous consequences were to be avoided, extreme patience and self-control were required.

The Foreign Secretary then reiterated Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement that Britain wished to see a peaceful resolution of the Polish-German dispute, but that if the situation was to be changed by force and Poland's independence was endangered, it would inevitably lead to a prairie fire involving Britain. The Foreign Secretary said at the end of the debate that his speech on June 8 had been given all sorts of contradictory interpretations by those who heard it, with some focusing on this sentence and others focusing on that sentence. In fact, the entire speech should be studied. He thought that the meaning of the speech was very clear, but some people had even said that British foreign policy had changed. He wished to state here that British foreign policy had not changed. His speech on June 8 was intended to make the people at home and abroad understand the truth of the government's response to the situation. There were two points in British policy that he wanted to explain: one was not to make threats or contain conspiracies, but to make the world understand that if force was used, those who used it would meet with a situation of using force to resist force; and the other was that if there was no intention to resort to force, it could not be underestimated, Britain's strength would be poured into negotiations to seek a fair solution. If such a debate could shift the attention of all countries and realize the dangerous methods of abandoning the use of force, and instead use the efforts of negotiation and reconciliation, which would be more beneficial, he would be pleased.

### US House Appropriations Committee Approves Additional Funding for the Army, Totaling $296.6 Million; Number of Aircraft Increased to 5,500

(Washington) The Army Department's request for additional funding, totaling $296,695,547, has been approved by the House Appropriations Committee. The allocation is as follows: (1) $189,845,547 to add 2,467 aircraft, bringing the total number of Army aircraft to 5,500 by July 1941; (2) $61,600,000 to add new air force bases and improve existing bases; (3) $27,000,000 to increase the garrison in the Panama Canal Zone from 3,916 to 9,916 personnel. (Havas dispatch of the 12th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt recently requested Congress to allocate $650 million to expand the Air Force and increase the number of military aircraft to 5,500. The case was submitted to a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee for review, and the famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh was asked to give his opinion. It is said that "Although our country's civilian aircraft are superior to those of European countries, our military aircraft are inferior. Regarding this level of the military, our country wants to regain a leading position in scientific research, which cannot be achieved in three to five years." It was decided to ask General Arnold, head of the Army Department's Aviation Bureau, to give his opinion, which was as follows: "Our country's goal in the Air Force is to focus on defense, which is different from the focus on attack in European countries. For this reason, we must build fast fighter planes, whose speed is above that of enemy bombers, which is the right way to proceed. What the government is currently working on is precisely this. The Army Department has recently ordered 524 "Curtis" fighters, with a speed of 644 kilometers per hour. Moreover, in terms of our country's "Flying Fortress" bombers, no country in the world can compare with it. Our country's plan to expand the Air Force is intended to give the people a guarantee that although the German Air Force has several types of aircraft that are superior to ours, our defense in the sky is extremely adequate, and we can rest easy."

US House Discusses New Neutrality Law

Restrictions on Trade Passed by Foreign Affairs Committee

(Washington) The US government's new neutrality law is now not far from formal implementation, as the restrictions on trade in the Bloom Bill were formally passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday. According to the bill, all American citizens, once the President has designated a combat zone, may not accept the patronage of belligerent nations, and may not lend loans and credit to belligerent nations, but medicines and clothing and food items will naturally be exceptions. The Bloom Bill was formed according to Hull's party-building principles, so the above-mentioned restrictions will not be applied to Latin American countries. (Associated Press dispatch of the 13th)

(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee met today to continue discussing the amendment to the Neutrality Act, and immediately voted to pass the first six sections of the amendment proposed by Chairman Bloom without much modification. It is expected that the discussion can be completed tomorrow, and the new draft Neutrality Act will be submitted to the House, and will soon be placed on the agenda. According to what the Foreign Affairs Committee should discuss tomorrow, it is the seventh section of the Bloom Bill, the content of which is related to the entry of warships of various belligerent nations into US ports.

Citing the Excuse of Avoiding Involvement in the War, Isolationist Independents Try to Obstruct

Representative Fische of New York, a Republican, recently gave a press conference, saying that he would give a radio broadcast speech and express his views at the House meeting to oppose the Bloom Bill, honestly because the case is called neutrality, "in fact, it is dominated by interventionism." If it is allowed to be established, President Roosevelt will have the power to designate war zones, allowing the United States to continue trade with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, but not with Germany and Italy. The impact is that the United States must join forces with Britain to fight, which should be avoided. Political figures believe that Fische's opposition is quite powerful and should not be underestimated, but the Bloom Bill can still be passed by the House. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

The small town usually has a population of 8,000, but it is expected to increase fivefold this time. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

(Washington) King George today cabled President Roosevelt to express his gratitude for the hospitality of President Roosevelt and his wife for the past four days. The original text stated, "The Queen and I are deeply grateful for the hospitality of Mrs. Roosevelt and Your Excellency for the past four days. The kindness that Mrs. Roosevelt and Your Excellency have given to us is not only a personal friendship, but also a feeling shared by the people of your country. We are grateful for this. Whether in Washington or New York, everything we have experienced has been a warm welcome. Although our visit to your great country has been very brief, the sincerity and goodwill that your country has given to us will always be cherished by us. We have no way to repay Your Excellency and the kindness of your country's people, so we especially send this letter to express our gratitude." (Associated Press dispatch of the 12th)

Hull Receives Ambassador to Japan

(Washington) US Ambassador to Japan Grew has returned to his country to report on his work and has arrived here. Today, he met with Secretary of State Hull, Undersecretary of State Welles, and other key members of the State Department to discuss the recent situation in the Far East. According to Secretary of State Hull, the discussion today was only on general issues, and continued talks will be held in the next few days. President Roosevelt is scheduled to return to Beijing tomorrow, and Ambassador Grew will also pay a visit to submit a report. After staying in Washington for a few days, he will go north for a short period of rest, and then return to Washington to continue talks with the authorities. (Havas dispatch of the 12th)

Hull Invites Germany and Italy to Join US Commercial Agreement

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull made a formal statement here today inviting Germany and Italy to join the US reciprocal commercial agreement plan. Hull said the United States hopes that in the coming years, all countries can join this plan. If the two major countries conclude a differentiated method of dividing their spheres of influence, other countries will inevitably adopt economic plans for self-defense, and the result will not be able to promote peace, economic recovery and progress, but will only lead to the common subversion of all countries. The economic survival of small countries that conclude such methods with large countries will gradually depend on large countries, and eventually become political appendages of large countries.

German Chief of Staff Scheduled to Visit Estonia and Finland at the End of the Month

(Berlin) At the invitation of the commanders-in-chief of the armies of Estonia and Finland, German Chief of Staff General Halder will visit these countries at the end of this month. Political figures here attach great importance to General Halder's visit, given that the Soviet Union, regardless of the will of the Baltic states, is trying to interfere in Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. As for whether General Halder's trip will involve special talks with these countries, it is impossible to know. (Haitong dispatch of the 13th)

### Responding to the Mediterranean Situation: Egyptian and Turkish Cooperation; Negotiations Between the Two Parties Have Made Progress; British-Turkish Agreement Reaches Implementation Measures

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax received the Egyptian Ambassador, Dr. Naji, yesterday morning to discuss the general situation in the Mediterranean. The ambassador reportedly informed Halifax that Egypt, Hejaz, and Yemen would join the Near East Pact. (This pact was previously signed in 1937 by Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan.) Negotiations had been conducted by the Egyptian and Turkish authorities and had recently made progress. Diplomatic circles here interpreted that the purpose of the negotiations was to enable Egypt and Turkey to cooperate closely in the event of war in the eastern Mediterranean, which is of great significance. (Havas Dispatch, 13th)

(London) Informed Turkish sources here recently stated that the implementation measures for the British-Turkish mutual assistance agreement have been agreed upon. Britain will send a military delegation to Turkey to hold talks with the Turkish military authorities. In addition, the Turkish military delegation has been in London for many days, "negotiating with the British authorities on the purchase of military supplies. After Turkey established a mutual assistance agreement with Britain, the German authorities informed Turkey that the major military supplies ordered by Turkey from German and former Czechoslovak factories would be stopped. Therefore, the military supplies needed by Turkey would naturally be supplied by Britain. For this reason, the Turkish military delegation, accompanied by officials from the British War Office, has been inspecting various factories. They will also exchange views with the British General Staff on cooperation between the two countries' navies and armies in the Balkans and the Near East. However, the nature of the discussions will be very general. The detailed measures will be decided after the British military delegation arrives in Turkey and discusses them with the Turkish authorities. (Havas Dispatch, 13th)

Baltic States: Security Issues

Pravda Publishes Commentary: Learning from Czechoslovakia's Example

(Moscow) Pravda's editorial commented on the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states against aggression, stating, "Foreign newspapers continue to criticize Molotov's speech to the Supreme Soviet, particularly the section concerning the assistance that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should provide to Estonia, Latvia, and Finland when these Baltic countries are invaded and unable to defend their neutrality. Initially, some foreign newspapers believed that this issue was artificially created for some unclear purpose. Now they have to admit that this estimate was wrong, and guaranteeing the neutrality of the three countries is of great importance to the security of the Soviet Union. Another group opposes raising this issue, claiming that it has no real connection with Britain and France. They have also admitted their error. The current state of negotiations shows that Britain and France are no less concerned than the Soviet Union about maintaining the neutrality of the three Baltic states. British Conservative politicians such as Churchill have also had to admit that this issue is very important to Britain and France. He advocated providing guarantees to Latvia, Estonia, and Finland, saying, 'If Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are invaded by the Nazis, or if they are forced to adopt Nazism through internal propaganda and conspiracies, all of Europe will be drawn into war. In other words, if the independence and integrity of the three countries are destroyed, Poland will have to go to war, and consequently, Britain, France, and Russia will all have to go to war.' However, although most foreign newspapers now admit that Molotov's proposal to assist the Baltic states is correct in principle, they are still reluctant to draw the necessary practical conclusions on this issue. Some people say that the guarantees of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are not in line with the rights and interests of the three Baltic states, claiming that these countries do not need external assistance to defend their independence and resist aggression. This is certainly wrong. For example, Czechoslovakia had twice as many people and troops as all three countries combined, but because it was isolated and without assistance, it could not defend itself. How can these three small Baltic countries be superior to Czechoslovakia? From this point of view, it is only natural that the people of the three countries welcome the guarantees of independence from peaceful great powers. Others claim that if the three countries accept assistance from powerful neighbors, it is equivalent to losing their sovereignty and independence. This statement is completely absurd. Britain has provided assistance guarantees to France, Poland, and Turkey, and these countries have also guaranteed assistance to Britain. Belgium's neutrality is guaranteed by Britain and France. Have these countries lost their sovereignty and independence as a result? Finally, some British and French newspapers say that the official representatives of the three countries have expressed their refusal of assistance from peaceful nations, claiming that they do not need assistance and other countries cannot force it upon them. Estonian Foreign Minister Selter and Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko have made such statements. Regarding this point, if there is no misunderstanding, then there is some malicious attempt to sabotage the organization of the anti-aggression defense line of peaceful nations. The article mentioned earlier that the people of the three countries greatly welcome the assistance given by peaceful countries when their countries are directly or indirectly invaded. This is an undeniable fact. If so, then why did Selter and Erkko refuse the assistance of peaceful nations? The reason for this may be that the above-mentioned politicians underestimate the threat of aggression. Not long ago, our newspaper pointed out that Romania and Poland also had this tendency to underestimate the threat. Some of their representatives not only opposed the Soviet Union's guarantees to them, but also opposed the establishment of an assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the environment has forced these opposing claims to be withdrawn. In the near future, some representatives of the three Baltic states may also withdraw their opposing claims. This possibility exists because the threat of aggression has become increasingly clear, as detailed in President Roosevelt's recent note. At the same time, it is also because the inherent needs of the three countries and the assistance of peaceful nations to resist aggression will make them recognize it more clearly. However, regarding the attitude of the above-mentioned politicians of Estonia and Finland, there seems to be another explanation. It is entirely possible that they have been influenced by foreign countries, even if they are not directly manipulated by those who are trying to hinder the formation of a broad anti-aggression front. It is difficult for us to determine who is manipulating them at present. Aggressor countries are inherently intent on destruction, but some reactionary forces within democratic countries are also trying to limit aggression to certain areas and allow it to run rampant elsewhere. Henri de Kérillis, a well-known right-wing journalist from the French bourgeoisie, also believes that this assumption is possible, which is a very important sign. From this point of view, the final opposition to Molotov's guarantee of the Baltic states from aggression, from the perspective of the interests of the anti-aggression front of peaceful nations, is also baseless, and is the same as the other items. Therefore, the Soviet Union's position on guaranteeing the Baltic states from aggression is the only correct position, and is fully in line with the interests of all peace-loving nations, including Estonia, Latvia, and Finland.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Hainan Island: Britain and France Maintain Close Liaison

(London) Opposition Labour MP Roberts asked in the House of Commons that, after the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and the Xisha Islands, the interests held by Britain and France in the Far East have been threatened. Has the government exchanged views with the French government, or does it intend to do so? Foreign Office official Butler immediately replied, "According to the information received by Foreign Secretary Halifax, Japanese troops have occupied part of Hainan Island, and it does not appear that there has been a military occupation of the Xisha Islands. Regarding this matter, the government is maintaining close liaison with the French government." (Havas Dispatch, 12th)

### Bishop Yu Pin Broadcasts at the New York World's Fair: Expresses Gratitude to Pittman for His Sympathy Towards China: Hopes the United States Will Quickly Relieve Chinese Refugees: And Welcomes Large-Scale American Investment in China

New York Dispatch. After the opening of the New York World's Fair, celebrities from various countries in New York were invited to broadcast speeches. On the evening of May 23rd, at 10:00 PM, the Fair invited Bishop Yu Pin to give a broadcast, with an audience of over 10 million people. Yu's broadcast content was divided into three points: (1) Regarding Pittman's amendment to the Neutrality Act, he believes that if the embargo on military supplies to aggressor countries can be effectively stipulated and implemented, it can be considered a fundamental solution. He expressed gratitude for Pittman's sympathy towards the invaded countries and his support for China. (2) The most urgent matter at present is to relieve Chinese refugees. During the great famine in Tsarist Russia in previous years, the United States donated 70 million US dollars. Now, China is being invaded by a powerful neighbor, and the entire Chinese nation is fighting heroically for independence, survival, and human justice. There are 30 million refugees in the war zone, whose suffering is unprecedented, but the donations received are only 1 million US dollars. China and the United States have always had a strong relationship, and China is also fighting for the democratic principles that the United States believes in. He hopes that the entire American people will rise up to help. (3) Since the start of the War of Resistance, China has been actively carrying out economic construction projects in the northwest and southwest provinces, and the future development is immeasurable. He hopes that Americans will actively invest and welcome large-scale participation.

### Japanese Troops Invade Guangdong: The Recent Battle Situation is Tight and Loose: Japanese Troops Barely Maintain Their Strongholds: More Troops of the Northwest River Army Were Annihilated

Shaoguan Correspondence. The Japanese army is still actively reinforcing its troops for military operations in Guangdong, so the battle situation in the East, West, and North Rivers is sometimes tight and sometimes loose. The recent situation is as follows:

North River. Chinese and Japanese troops still use Conghua and Huaxian as the front lines. The Japanese troops in Longkou on the Guanghua Road have recently received reinforcements and frequently harass the Chinese army's positions. On the morning of May 31, the Japanese troops in Longkou sent hundreds of infantry and cavalry in two directions: one route sneaked to the areas east of Pingshan, including Sanxiang Mountain and Jiuchuan Lake, and the other route spied on Lianglongxu on the Guanghua Line, with about 200 people at each location. After reaching each place, they carried out extensive searches of the villages, arrested strong men, and forcibly injected poisonous needles into the villagers. Upon receiving the report, Zhao's division of the Chinese defenders immediately sent teams to intercept and annihilate them in separate directions. The Japanese troops only resisted slightly before fleeing in a panic along the original route. As a result, the Chinese army killed dozens of Japanese soldiers and seized many poisons and toxic liquids. Over a hundred villagers were arrested by the Japanese troops. On the Qianxin Street section along the Yuehan Railway, the Japanese troop movements are also very busy, with military vessels running non-stop all day long. Zhao's division of the Chinese army in that area suddenly attacked the Japanese troops in Qianxin Street on the morning of the 1st of this month, with one route bypassing Letong to the south along the railway and attacking the front of the Japanese troops, and the other route flanking from the side of Huangqi Mountain, engaging the Japanese troops in close combat in the northwestern suburbs of Qianxin Street. The Japanese troops bombarded the Chinese army's positions with artillery. A certain regiment of the Chinese army was exceptionally brave, breaking into the Japanese positions and charging in hand-to-hand combat. The battle was extremely fierce. After two hours of stalemate, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand and fled back to Qianxin Street, stubbornly resisting. In this battle, nearly a hundred Japanese troops were killed and more than twenty firearms were captured. As for Huangqi Mountain near Qianxin Street, it is still surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops have repeatedly attacked, but they have been repelled. However, the Japanese troops have not given up. On the afternoon of the 2nd, they sent a reconnaissance plane to scout around Huangqi Mountain for a long time. At about 2:00 PM, two Japanese planes arrived over the area again and continuously dropped more than ten bombs on the Chinese army's positions. Fortunately, the Chinese army evacuated properly and there was no damage. The Japanese planes only destroyed more than thirty nearby civilian houses, killing and injuring several villagers.

East River. The troops of both sides on the East River are still in a standoff across the Zeng River, with no major contact between Zeng and Bo. The Chinese army on the Zengcong Line is very active, constantly attacking the Japanese troops. On the night of the 30th of last month, the Lin Junsheng unit of the Third District Guerrilla Column, along with the special service team of Peng's division, totaling over a hundred people, charged into Zhongxin Market in two routes. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops near the Guanyin Temple. That night, the moonlight was dim. The Japanese troops, unaware of the actual situation, ran around in confusion, stubbornly resisting in a panic. While engaging the Japanese troops, the Chinese army set fire to two Japanese military sheds and factories at the market entrance, and safely retreated around 10:30 PM, capturing two Japanese military horses and killing several Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops were extremely angry about the attack that night. After the Chinese army retreated, they imposed a curfew that night, extensively searching all the shops in the market and arresting more than a dozen coolies who were sleeping in the open, accusing them of being guerrillas and brutally torturing them. On the morning of the 1st of this month, in order to continue attacking the Japanese troops, Peng's division specially ordered a certain unit to advance towards Zhucun. At about 10:00 AM that morning, they approached Zhucun and came into contact with the Japanese troops in the nearby Songgang. The Japanese troops stubbornly defended their positions, resisting with dense machine gun fire. The Chinese army also did not avoid hardship and continued to advance. In the afternoon, they occupied the strongholds of Shiqiaotou and Dagang north of Zhucun. Zhucun was under the control of the Chinese army. The Guangzeng Highway may be cut off by the Chinese army at any time. As for the south bank of the East River, the fighting is relatively quiet because the Japanese troops are mostly entrenched. The Japanese troops, who are entrenched in Wanheng, Shilong, and Taiping, have been constantly pressured by various corps of the Chinese army. In an attempt to break through the Chinese army's line, they have repeatedly decided to send troops to attack the Chinese army's positions. However, the Chinese army is strong and heavily guarded, and the Japanese troops have been repeatedly repelled. The Japanese troops, knowing that it is not easy to achieve their goal, have not made any changes in the past half month and have only adopted a defensive posture. However, in the above-mentioned areas, they are actively promoting the puppet government and arranging defenses. On the 1st of this month, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were sent to Wanheng and Shilong to increase their defenses. The Japanese troops sent to Shilong were stationed at the railway station, and a part of the Japanese troops sent to Wanheng were sent to the Wanzhang Highway for guard duty on the 3rd. Judging from their intentions, it is to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking. Zhang Zuxun, the puppet county magistrate of Dongguan, recently received orders from the Japanese army to organize a puppet pacification team to lure villagers to participate by means of threats and inducements, claiming that they were tasked with pacifying local security and searching for bandits, the same as the police. In reality, the Japanese side is exhausted of manpower and fears that it will not be able to maintain the existing strongholds, so it wants to use the villagers to control the Chinese with the Chinese. As for the Chinese army in that area, it has achieved many victories since being ordered to attack on May 5. It is learned that certain units have also been fighting for a long time, and various aspects of manpower and materials need to be adjusted and supplemented. Therefore, they are taking the opportunity to eliminate the old and weak and replenish the elite, in order to improve the basic quality. Also, a certain unit of the Chinese army operating on the Shi (An) Tai (Ping) Road mixed into Taiping Huanzhi Township on the 1st of this month and killed the puppet township chief Li Duanxia. On Li's body, they found a "Toramon District Narahara Unit" badge.

West River. There is more contact between the troops of both sides between the West River and the North River. The Chinese army in that area is gradually pressing towards the Japanese army, and is harassing the Japanese army with a strategy of elusiveness. Zhao's division, which is fighting on the Chan-Tan Line, is attacking Fengyong Guanyao. As for the Japanese troops entrenched in Fengyong, since the main force that sneaked into Tanbu on the 14th of last month was defeated, they have been surrounded and annihilated by Zhao's division in recent weeks. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the harassment, abandoned the nearby strongholds such as Wengang and Xianggang, and retreated to defend Fengyong and Guanyao. Zhao's division continued to attack the Japanese army. The fierce fighting has not stopped since the 29th. In the past few days, more than a hundred Japanese troops have been annihilated. On the morning of the 1st of this month, the Japanese troops specially shortened their defense lines and retreated to defend the Jinshan Temple and other positions. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to pursue them. The Japanese troops fled south across the river in a panic, abandoning many supplies and documents. There is now no trace of Japanese troops in the Fengyong and Shitang areas. When the Japanese troops in Fengyong withdrew to the south, they extensively looted all the grain and property in the entire market, and demolished the wooden bridge connecting the Chan-Tan Line to the Jinshan Temple, hoping to prevent the Chinese army from pursuing them. In order to completely annihilate the Japanese troops, Zhao's division continued to advance south. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, the Chinese army launched a clear attack on the Japanese troops in Jinshan Temple, with one route pressing from Fengyong and the other route advancing eastward from Guanyao, cutting off the Japanese army's support on the Chan-Tan Road. That day, artillery battles were launched near Jinshan Temple. The roaring sound echoed far and wide. At noon, the Chinese officers and soldiers, taking advantage of the artillery fire cover, rallied their spirits and attacked the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops also stubbornly resisted, and the battle situation was quite fierce. It was still in a stalemate at dusk, but the Chinese army had already occupied a dominant position, and the Jinshan Temple stronghold could be recovered soon. Also, along the Chan-Tan Line from Fengyong Jinshan Temple to Foshan, the Japanese troops have been very busy transporting supplies in recent days, and Japanese soldiers have also been frequently mobilized. It was discovered that on the morning of May 30, more than a dozen Japanese vehicles, fully loaded with military supplies, were transported from Foshan to Fengyong, and more than 200 Japanese soldiers were sent to the Jinshan Temple area to increase their defenses. In order to contain the Japanese army's transportation, the guerrillas who are active on that line gathered more than a hundred team members that night and launched a night attack on Songgang Market. They and dozens of daredevils charged into the market and engaged in a mixed battle with the Japanese troops. The rest carried explosives and destroyed and blew up the nearby highways. The Japanese soldiers, hearing the sound of gunfire, were awakened and responded, and sent teams to search, but in the dark, they could not use their powerful artillery fire, and only randomly fired machine guns at the Chinese army. They waited until about 3:00 AM the next day, when the Chinese team members had completed their mission and triumphantly retreated. That night, more than ten Japanese sentries were annihilated, and more than twenty zhang of the nearby highways were dug up and blown up.

As for the Japanese troops west of Lubao, on the 29th, they sent more than 600 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, along with three airplanes, to harass along the Lu-Xi Road. They used artillery to cover their advance. Chen's division of the Chinese army, along with the tax police corps and the Ou Hanzhang unit of guerrillas, fought back in separate directions in Huangtang, Nanbian Market, Qucun, Niulan and other places. After holding out until dusk, the Chinese army waited for the Japanese troops to become exhausted and then launched a counterattack. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand and retreated along the original route, abandoning many supplies and ammunition. In this battle, the Chinese army annihilated more than a hundred Japanese troops. When the Japanese troops retreated, they set fire to and looted along the way, causing the villages of Lucun, Nanbian Market, Niulangang, and Qucun to be burned and looted. The people fled to Lubao in droves. On the morning of the 30th, Chen's division and the tax police corps, in order to sweep away the remaining Japanese troops in one go, tracked and searched them, advancing along the Lu-Xi Road. At noon, they encountered the Japanese troops in Yangmei and Buyuetang, and another fierce battle broke out. The officers and soldiers of a certain battalion of the Chinese army bravely charged into the Japanese positions and engaged the Japanese troops in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. After two hours of fighting, the Chinese army retreated and defended the dangerous terrain northwest of Yangmei, monitoring the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops, having suffered repeated military setbacks, mostly retreated back to the southwest towns belonging to Sanshui County, with only a small part guarding Yangmei and Baoyuetang along the Lu-Xi Road. Also, on the morning of the 29th, more than 200 Japanese infantry and cavalry, coming from Sanshui along the Si-San Highway, arrived at Heigang and Mao'ergang near Mumian, and used small steel cannons to bombard the old Sanshui coastline of Zhuzhou, Wanggang, and Hantang, and sent several motorboats and more than a hundred Russian soldiers to patrol and spy around the old Sanshui area. They were spotted by the Chinese defenders, who waited for the Japanese boats to approach and then set up a fire net to fiercely strafe the Japanese boats. The Japanese boats hurriedly returned, and as a result, one boat was sunk, and more than ten Japanese soldiers fell into the water and drowned.

### Zhenhai Air Defense Department: Shoots Down Japanese Reconnaissance Plane: Japanese Pilot Dies of Injuries: Rumor That Xiaoan's Ancestral Tomb Was Also Bombed

Ningbo Correspondence. On the 7th of this month, the Zhenhai Air Defense Force shot down a Japanese plane, which crashed into the Youshan Sea outside Zhenhai Port. It was identified as an Type 89 biplane reconnaissance plane, manufactured in Italy. The pilot, whose parachute was deployed, died of injuries from the fall and was buried in Zhenhai. In this battle, the Chinese side recovered a parachute, a pistol, a flight cap, and a pair of leather boots, which were sent to Yong yesterday.

At 9:30 AM on the 10th, seven Japanese planes bombed Zhenhai, dropping three bombs in Xiaogang and eleven bombs in the port area. In addition to destroying more than a hundred civilian houses, killing two women and injuring one woman, the ancestral tomb of Shanghai puppet mayor Chuan Xiaoan in Qingzhi was almost completely destroyed. The coffins were shattered and the corpses were scattered. Unfilial descendants bring disaster to their ancestors, a warning.

### Puppet Organization Appears on Daishan Island

Promoting counterfeit currency and collecting exorbitant taxes: Anti-war sentiment is very strong among Japanese soldiers

Dinghai Correspondence. Since Daishan Island was forcibly occupied by the Japanese army on the 22nd of last month, the local area has been ravaged and the islanders are suffering unspeakable pain, and are fleeing in droves. Gao Asheng and his ilk, shameless people, in order to cater to the Japanese side, convened a mass meeting and established a puppet autonomous association, which was reorganized on the 1st of this month into a "Maintenance Association." They forcibly forced merchants to use counterfeit currency, promoted toxic policies such as opium, gambling, and prostitution, and forced fishing boats to register, charging two yuan per boat. Afterwards, the captured fish were forced to not trade with Duopo and Dinghai, and a salt tax sub-department was established in Dongsha Corner to levy exorbitant salt taxes, which was contracted by the traitor Fan Chucai, but the levy has not yet started.

The Japanese troops who landed on Daishan were found to be the troops under the command of He Yin of the First Minesweeping Command, with more than 300 marines stationed in Dongsha Corner, Gaoting, and Beifeng Mountain. However, many Japanese anti-war leaflets have been appearing in the streets and lanes of Dongsha Corner in recent days, and Japanese officers are unable to control the situation. Five Japanese warships, one transport ship, one armed fishing boat, and many speedboats are currently anchored in Daishan.

### Japanese Troops in Qingpu Excavate Jiupingshan (Wine Bottle Mountain)

Thousand-year-old historic site destroyed

Qingpu Correspondence. The old Qingyong town, belonging to the county, is located on the bank of Qinglong Port. About half a mile west of the town, there is a Jiupingshan (Wine Bottle Mountain), which is a historic site where Han Shizhong of the Song Dynasty rewarded his troops. It is named after the wine bottles piled up like a mountain. It was once excavated by farmers, who sold complete ones at a good price, with each bottle costing tens of yuan, but it was immediately strictly prohibited by the authorities. Until now, the historic site still exists. In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the county party department, together with the county education bureau, surrounded the mountain with wooden fences and erected a stone monument to mark the memorial. Before the war, many people from far and near came to visit, but unexpectedly, it is now coveted by the Japanese side, who forced nearby villagers to excavate it for them. The thousand-year-old historic site has been completely destroyed as a result.

### Japanese Troops in Funing Search Civilian Residences

Towns and cities also burned down

Funing Correspondence. Funing was once occupied by the Japanese army last summer, and they retreated after more than 50 days. Most of the houses in the city were burned down. In February of this year, it was lost again. The Japanese army, with only more than 200 people, did not dare to harass the countryside. However, Japanese warships often arrived at Sheyang Lake, and gasoline boats came and went, often docking at the shore. The residents, hearing the news, fled in droves. The Japanese army then searched the houses on both sides of the bank for clothes, sundries, food, etc., and transported them out to sea. Recently, bandit chiefs Zhu Baoyuan, Guo Liu, Gu and other gangs of bandits, numbering three to four hundred, were used by the Japanese army to rob the shops and goods in Donggou, Yilin, Fenggu Village, Zhanggou and other towns. They burned down the houses in Hagang, Batan, Caijiaqiao, Sanjie, Erchang and other towns, leaving them completely empty. On the 4th of this month, the Japanese army and the guerrillas opened fire in the area of Ertagou, with the Japanese army suffering more than 40 casualties. Four Japanese gasoline boats were sunk. Currently, refugees are sleeping in the open fields everywhere, and the sound of crying shakes the sky. The situation is too horrible to bear.

### Local News: Rumors Spread of Threats Against British Ambassador; Ambassador Takes Necessary Precautions

Reuters, London, 13th: According to "Daily Mail," the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has recently received several warning letters threatening his life. As a result, he is constantly surrounded by multiple bodyguards. The Ambassador and embassy staff are wearing bulletproof vests as a precaution.

The North-China Daily News reports that, in light of the threats against the life of British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the Shanghai Municipal Police of the International Settlement took special precautions yesterday (12th) afternoon at the British Embassy and at the Ambassador's residence at No. 50 Yu Yuen Road. The embassy offices are located in the Jardine Matheson Building. Uniformed Chinese and Western police officers are stationed at the building's entrance and in the lobby. The entire sixth floor is occupied by the embassy offices, and a Chinese constable is stationed in front of each of the two elevators on that floor. A reporter who entered the main office saw five Western detectives sitting in the waiting room, their eyes fixed on the office entrance.

Ambassador Has Not Received Threatening Letters

When a reporter questioned a senior official at the embassy, the official declined to disclose the nature of the threat. However, it was learned that the threat did not originate from official channels. The British Ambassador has not received threatening letters. Another source said last night that the police have received intelligence regarding a plot and have taken precautions accordingly.

Armed Escort Front and Rear of Vehicle

Yesterday afternoon, at nearly 5:45 PM, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr left the embassy and walked to his car, sitting on the right side. Two detectives wearing steel mesh vests and the Ambassador's secretary were seated in the back of the car. Uniformed police officers on motorcycles traveled ahead of the Ambassador's car, while a police car with three detectives wearing steel mesh vests, all armed with pistols at the ready, followed behind to protect the Ambassador.

Considerable Precautions Taken at the Residence as Well

Similar precautions have also been taken at the Ambassador's residence. Western detectives are stationed both inside and outside the residence, and it is said that additional permanent guards have been assigned. A uniformed police officer is stationed behind the residence. A Western detective stands guard outside the iron gate, while a guard with a loaded rifle and bayonet stands inside the gate.

Threats Stem from Rumors

The Continental Daily News reports that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has received threats of a serious nature. Therefore, extra military and police personnel are stationed at various points, including the Ambassador's residence at No. 50 Yu Yuen Road and the British Embassy office at No. 27 The Bund, to provide protection. The exact nature of the threat has not been disclosed. However, an embassy official told a reporter last night (12th) that the threats against the British Ambassador were not conveyed through letters, but rather through rumors circulating in the outside world.

Police Investigating

It is said that the Ambassador received notification of the threat towards the end of last week. The police received a report and immediately took precautions. Both the British Embassy and the police department are taking the matter seriously and taking all possible measures. On Saturday and Sunday nights, additional police officers and a squad of British soldiers from the West Yorkshire Regiment were stationed at the Ambassador's residence. Yesterday morning, patrolmen were also stationed inside the British Embassy building on the Bund. Western detectives from the Jing'an Temple police station also assisted in protecting the Ambassador during his commutes between his residence and office. According to officials at the British Embassy and the police department, all threats, whether from fantasists, pranksters, or those with genuine malicious intent, will be investigated. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr had no choice but to take strict precautions after receiving the threats.

### After Shortage of Copper Subsidiary Coins in Shanghai, Proper Remedial Measures Are Being Planned; Permission to Issue Small Denomination Notes for Circulation; Postage Stamps Used as a Temporary Measure

Due to unscrupulous merchants collecting old copper coins and coppers in the Shanghai market for profit, a serious shortage has occurred. In addition to using postage stamps and revenue stamps as substitutes, businesses have also requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to quickly plan remedial measures. At the same time, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has also reported to its head office. The details are as follows:

Central Bank Reports Situation

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Life News learned from relevant sources that, in addition to using postage stamps and revenue stamps as substitutes for copper coins, businesses have also requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to quickly plan remedial measures. At the same time, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has also reported the causes and course of the copper coin shortage in Shanghai to its head office, which has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Director of the Currency Department to study and consider remedial measures. It is considered inappropriate to continue transporting new copper coins minted by various mints in other locations to Shanghai to alleviate the situation, because if large quantities are transported to Shanghai again, unscrupulous merchants will inevitably collect and smuggle them out again. Furthermore, the price of copper overseas is soaring, and certain military arms merchants are in great need. As for the issue of issuing small denomination notes, it is considered feasible and a solution will be found in the near future.

Hope for Swift Decision from Ministry of Finance

Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the nickel content in nickel coins is limited, and the copper content in one-cent copper coins is also negligible. The rumor that someone is purchasing them at high prices is considered unbelievable. The current shortage of copper and nickel coins is caused by unscrupulous merchants hoarding them for speculation. Therefore, leaders in the silver and money industry have jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, suggesting that a large quantity of subsidiary coins be quickly transported to Shanghai to alleviate the situation. A reporter from the New New News inquired with the silver and money industry about this, but was unable to confirm it. However, according to bankers, hoarding by unscrupulous merchants is one of the causes of the copper coin shortage. The fact that 50 million copper coins are exported annually is difficult to argue against. However, all sectors sincerely hope that the Ministry of Finance will quickly plan remedial measures. They are particularly eager for the Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent copper coin notes, because continuing to transport copper and nickel subsidiary coins to Shanghai will inevitably lead to them being absorbed by unscrupulous merchants and smuggled out again. Although the copper coin shortage and panic may be temporarily alleviated, the panic will inevitably recur. Therefore, it is hoped that the financial authorities will carefully consider and make a swift decision to relieve the suffering of the five million citizens of Shanghai caused by the copper coin shortage as soon as possible.

Must Be Cautious Issuing Substitute Vouchers

Because of the shortage of copper coins, businesses have been forced to use postage stamps or revenue stamps for small transactions, causing postage stamps to become the current common medium of exchange. The minimum transaction is now one cent, causing an invisible increase in prices. Goods that previously sold for one or two copper coins now cost one cent. However, cooked water vendors use self-made bamboo tallies for transactions. In addition to reissuing previously collected tokens to facilitate making change, the public transportation company has also jointly announced with the tram company: "Due to the extreme shortage of copper coins and five-cent nickel coins in the market, passengers are requested to pay the exact fare to avoid difficulty in making change. This is hereby announced for your information." It is said that the first to issue substitute vouchers were member stores of the 37th District Branch of the Shanghai United Association on North Fujian Road, issuing one-cent and two-cent denominations. Now, the 16th District Branch of the Shanghai United Association on New Zha Road will also convene its member stores at 4:00 PM today to discuss the issuance of substitute vouchers. However, according to a reporter from the New New News, although issuing substitute vouchers for use by stores to alleviate the current difficulties may gain some sympathy, it is generally inappropriate. This is because such vouchers have no specified reserve funds and no supervisory body, which not only causes many abuses but also involves the suspicion of privately issuing banknotes. It is hoped that all stores will carefully consider this and avoid future troubles.

Difficult to Ban Due to Lack of Authority

The Central Mint's Shanghai factory minted a total of 927,658,320 one-cent copper coins until it ceased operations at the end of July of the year before last. All of these were successively issued by the Central Bank for circulation in Shanghai. Now, unscrupulous merchants are collecting them for profit and smuggling them out of Shanghai to supply a certain party for use as military equipment. It is said that a profit of two dimes can be made for every 100 copper coins. As for copper coins with inscriptions of Guangxu and Great Qing, their coin quality is even better, so the profits are even greater. Although the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued notices banning and investigating, the central government's authority does not extend to Shanghai, which is located in the occupied area. Therefore, the Central Bank has decided to stop supplying Shanghai with copper coins.

Pudong is Preparing Another Anti-British Parade

Regarding the Lun Chang Factory incident in Pudong, the pro-Japanese New Shen Bao newspaper reported yesterday that the company's management, through its British General Manager Sinclair, has entrusted the Japanese to mediate the labor dispute and has been introduced by the Japanese to meet with the puppet "municipal government" to ease the external atmosphere. On the one hand, they are preparing a large-scale anti-British parade in Pudong, scheduled to take place this Thursday. At that time, ignorant workers from Lun Chang will still be forced to participate. It is said that the parade route will be much longer than before and will also demonstrate at the old Lun Chang factory in Bailianjing. This shows that the previous propaganda was merely a disguise for the puppet regime's anti-British activities, so that the instigation of the anti-British parade will be entirely attributed to the workers at the time.

Civilian Boat From Shanghai to Huzhou Seized Without a Trace

The Shanghai-Huzhou route has only recently resumed traffic. According to sources in the inland waterway transport industry yesterday, a civilian boat sailing from Shanghai a few days ago was suddenly attacked and detained near Bachichi, and its whereabouts are unknown. The ship was carrying a large quantity of goods, resulting in significant losses. Currently, water and land routes in western Zhejiang are experiencing difficulties due to the unstable situation, and traffic has completely stopped.

### Foreign Ship Violates Orders, Should Be Subject to Suspension of Navigation; De Ping Ship Fails to Comply with Defense Command Orders; Ningbo Authorities Grant Lenient Punishment, Detention for Ten Days

Da Guang News Agency reports that the Italian ship "De Ping" of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company encountered nine air raids on Ningbo on the 3rd. The ship failed to undergo inspection by military and police authorities before leaving Lower Baisha River for Shanghai, which the Ningbo Defense Command considered a violation of orders. After the ship sailed to Ningbo again on the morning of the 9th, it was detained for ten days. It is currently detained in Ningbo and must wait until the detention period expires before it can load cargo and return to Shanghai.

Another Version of the Reason for Detention

The New Life News Agency reports that the Ningbo and Wenzhou Defense Commanders, in order to facilitate cargo transportation, have specifically approved navigation between Ningbo and Wenzhou. However, it is stipulated that ships entering Ningbo are limited to carrying goods such as food rice. Now, the Italian ship "De Ping" of the Sino-Italian Company loaded cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Ningbo. Local authorities gave the order to suspend navigation because the ship was not loaded with rice. After the company repeatedly requested leniency, it finally obtained the understanding of the authorities, and the ship was given the punishment of suspending one voyage. It is currently scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo the day after tomorrow. As for the German ship "Harna" of the German Far East Company on the Shanghai-Dinghai line, it arrived in Shanghai from Dinghai yesterday morning. It is allowed to continue sailing to Dinghai at 4:00 AM this morning. However, according to the orders of the authorities, passengers are absolutely prohibited.

Ningbo Passengers Prevented from Entering Dinghai

After the Ningbo Defense Command was ordered to approve the restoration of the Shanghai-Ningbo route, all the original ships resumed sailing one after another. However, the authorities only allowed the transportation of cargo and absolutely prohibited passengers, causing inconvenience to people traveling back and forth between Shanghai and Ningbo. After the German ship "Harna" resumed sailing to Dinghai on the 5th, many passengers who wanted to come to Shanghai from Ningbo first took the Gaodeng ship to Dinghai to wait for the ship so that they could transfer to Shanghai. However, the Dinghai authorities, in accordance with orders prohibiting all ships from carrying passengers, absolutely prohibited it from carrying passengers when "Harna" set sail. Even after lobbying, it was not approved. Therefore, about 300 passengers from Ningbo were all blocked, and the situation was extremely embarrassing. It is said that "Harna" returned to Shanghai from Dinghai yesterday morning and will still sail to Dinghai at 4:00 PM today. It is said that this time it has been approved to carry passengers from Dinghai.

Absolutely Prohibit Passengers on All Ships

Furthermore, the German ship "Moufu" of the German Reiff, Holzhauer & Co. arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday morning and set sail for Ningbo at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. As for the British ship "New Beijing" of the British Swire Shipping which remained in Ningbo, it returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and arrived at the wharf of the company on the Bund in the French Concession at 6:30 PM yesterday. It is unloading cargo starting this morning. However, all ships are limited to carrying cargo and are absolutely prohibited from carrying passengers.

### Reiterate Previous Order Banning Silver Coins; Consolidate Legal Tender Credit; Should Exchange for Legal Tender at the Four Banks to Use; Actively Collect by Establishing More Collection Agencies

The Ministry of Finance (Yu) Qian Zi No. 3798 Circular to All Provincial Governments states: This Ministry's Second Phase of Wartime Administrative Plan Implementation Specific Plan and Phased Progress Table has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and transfer to the National Defense Supreme Committee for review. The financial matters in this plan, (1) consolidate the credit of legal tender, (2) collect gold and silver, state that remote areas in our country such as Mongolia, Tibet, Qinghai, and Ningxia still use silver coins. Their use should be strictly prohibited, and they should be actively collected. The Ministry of Finance has already telegraphed the military and political leaders of each area to issue a new announcement banning the use of hard currency and to instruct the gold and silver exchange offices of the four banks to establish more agencies to actively collect them, with the goal of completing the order to ban the use of hard currency in the shortest possible time and increase the amount of silver collected. The table notes that banning the use of hard currency has been continuously handled from the first to the eighth phase. The Ministry has repeatedly requested that all provincial governments inform their subordinates to announce and make it widely known. We should reiterate the previous order and strictly prohibit this. In addition to sending a separate circular, we also request that the head office of the joint office of the four banks instruct the gold and silver exchange offices to plan to increase the number of collection agencies. Accordingly, the government of your province is requested to examine this, instruct your subordinates to announce it, strictly prohibit the use of silver coins, and if users of silver coins are found, they should be immediately guided to send them to the nearby branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, or their entrusted exchange agencies, to exchange for legal tender for use, and the handling situation should be reported to the Ministry for review.

North Xin Jing Advanced Curfew Time

The North Xin Jing ferry crossing is an important inland waterway. Due to the unstable situation in western Shanghai in recent days, precautions have been stepped up. In addition to the ferry from the concession to North Xin Jing being suspended and not yet restored, the curfew has been advanced. After 6:00 PM every day, all ships and pedestrians are prohibited from traveling. Recently, the number of routes to Suzhou and Wuxi has been reduced, and ships arriving in Shanghai have also departed earlier to avoid accidents.

### One Type of Economic Aggression; Japanese Plan to Control Cotton Production; Established the So-Called "Cotton Production Promotion Association"; Established Experimental Fields in Nanjing and Dachang

Since the Japanese launched their war of aggression against China, they have been actively seizing resources in various occupied areas and using puppet organizations, under the guise of cooperation and promotion, to organize various industrial and commercial organizations, such as the "Central China Company," in order to control various industries in Central China. They have been particularly active in the cotton production sector. The Japanese previously initiated the establishment of the "Cotton Production Promotion Association." Recently, the association has expanded its organization and increased its capital to 300,000 yuan, with China and Japan each bearing half. The "President" is Liang Hongzhi, the "President of the Executive Yuan" who was recently poisoned in Nanjing. The "Chairman" is Wang Zihui, and the "Vice Chairmen" are Shen Nengyi and Kosera. However, the actual power is in the hands of the Japanese, and the Chinese are only used as pawns. It is now said that cotton seed experimental fields have been established in Dachang in this city and near Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing, with Japanese personnel Bonara and Ikeda serving as technicians. Cotton planting will begin soon.

### If Japan Attempts to Seize Concessions, It Will Lead to Tragic Consequences; New York Times Far East Manager So Tam; Shanghai Watches Tianjin Situation; Japanese Residents South of Suzhou Creek Will Move North

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that Mr. Abender, the Far East Manager of the New York Times, recently took a short trip to Japan with friends and then returned to the United States. Mr. Abender has been in China for thirteen years and this is his first leave of absence in five years to return to his country. During his trip to Japan, he stated to guests that it is difficult to expect the Third Power countries to accept Japan's request to reform the Shanghai International Settlement immediately, because this matter is very complicated and must be resolved gradually. According to Mr. Abender, reforming the municipal administration of the International Settlement involves many things. This kind of event cannot be resolved quickly at this time. Hasty actions would only disrupt the settlement and be of no benefit. It is difficult to expect related countries to accept Japan's recent request to reform the administrative structure of the concession immediately. If Japan occupies the concession by force, the tragic consequences will be unimaginable, because terrorists may take the opportunity to act and frame Japan in order to put Japan in a difficult position.

The Current Situation is Very Peaceful

The current situation in the concession is very peaceful, because the Shanghai Municipal Council officials are taking strict precautions and expelling all Chinese suspected of terrorism from the concession, so the peace and order in the concession can be well maintained. Mr. Abender also mentioned the current Sino-Japanese war, saying that the war will last a long time, and no one can know when it will end, because the military and financial strength of both sides is unknown to the outside world, so it is difficult to make predictions.

Solve the Outstanding Cases, We Should Seek Patience

However, if Japan wants to end the Chinese incident as soon as possible, sending another 150,000 troops to China to leave no room for guerrillas to operate is absolutely necessary. The Chinese army is not very afraid of Japanese air raids now, and China has not built a large arsenal that is worth bombing. China prevents bombing, so the arsenals that have been built are small in scale and scattered throughout various places. The value of each one does not exceed one thousand pounds. Mr. Abender did not say that although there are many outstanding cases between the Japanese authorities and the foreign authorities in China that need to be resolved, the surface is still friendly. Japan should be patient in resolving many problems. The Japanese authorities already know this.

The Ding Case is Not Over, The Violence Is Increasing

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the violence between the Japanese army and navy authorities in China has increased and has led to the death of Ding Geller in Shanghai. Now it leads to taking special precautions to protect the life of British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. Since Saturday, the British soldiers of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the patrolmen stationed at the Ambassador's residence at No. 50 Yu Yuen Road have more than doubled. The Ambassador is protected by agents wearing steel mesh vests on both sides when traveling by car. This is all the result of Japanese threats.

Lun Chang Workers Prevented from Entering the Factory

After the Japanese party instigated a strike at the Lun Chang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, Ding Geller was killed in a tragic death. When the instigators accompanied the workers who wanted to return to work and forced their way into the factory, they were all arrested. However, the instigators managed to escape their Japanese protection and went straight to the power room, trying to damage it. Mr. Ding fired a shot there, trying to scare off the instigators who the Japanese soldiers were not managing, and became the target of the Japanese soldiers' attention. They took his gun and stabbed him with a bayonet. In the past few days, armed groups have fired guns at the Lun Chang printing factory in Bailianjing to scare off workers from returning to the factory. In addition to hiring this single armed group, the Japanese party has also posted many anti-British and anti-foreign leaflets in Pudong.

This City is Concerned About the Tianjin Situation; Shanghai is also deeply concerned about the Tianjin situation in addition to paying attention to the situation in this city. Although the Japanese army there has clearly stated that it will take care of the interests of third countries, it seems to have prepared to block the British and French concessions tomorrow (14th). Sources in this city said that Japanese residents living in the International Settlement or the French Concession south of the Suzhou Creek have been ordered to move to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, and those who violate the order will be punished by revoking their passports. This move is similar to the relocation of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. Looking at the Japanese business houses on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek that own their own houses, from the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund to the yarn factories in the Yichang Road area, this move is quite serious. Even Japanese women who cohabit with foreigners on the south bank have also received orders to move to the north bank.

French Park Brass Band Concert

The Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold a brass band concert at the French Park from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM on the 14th of this month (weather permitting). The program includes seven items.

### 工部局's Control of Commodity Prices: No Immediate Trend, But Intervention Planned When Key Items Reach "Famine Point"

Spokesperson's Informal Remarks

The "Continental Times" reports that prices in Shanghai continue to rise to unprecedented levels, with food prices generally increasing by about 30%. Yesterday, an 工部局 spokesperson informally told reporters that the 工部局 would only use special powers to control rising prices when essential items like rice reach a "famine point." This is particularly relevant to the Chinese population. The 工部局 did not make a formal statement yesterday, and the board meeting scheduled for 4:30 PM today (the 13th) is not expected to discuss this matter.

This Situation Cannot Last. Well-informed sources believe that, regardless of the legal tender, this situation is temporary. Supply and demand will adjust the situation. If someone raises prices for profit, others will set lower prices to attract customers. Many believe that if rice prices soar, creating a rice famine, the 工部局 will follow the precedent of the 1937 rice shortage after the start of the war and import rice to sell at regulated, reasonable prices.

Difficult to Suppress Observed Phenomena. Western medicines have also increased in price. According to Bayer Pharmaceuticals, their drugs have increased by about 30%. Other items, such as rubber goods, rental cars, and imported cigarettes, have also increased in price. Although beer prices remain the same, observations suggest that a price increase is inevitable in the near future.

Prosperity in Consumption Unlikely to Last. According to a financier, the current prosperity in Shanghai is only in terms of consumption and is unlikely to last. The reasons are that those who came to Shanghai to escape the war will gradually run out of funds and be unable to continue. Recently, exchange rates have tightened again, and all commodity prices have risen. The decline in citizens' purchasing power is very evident. Since the exchange rate tightened, foreign goods have increased in price, and goods directly or indirectly related to foreign goods have also increased, such as gasoline, kerosene, hardware, coal, rental cars, paper, piece goods, leather, enamelware, steel, paint, screws, and other daily necessities, all without exception. Recently, the lack of copper-nickel subsidiary coins has made it difficult to make change, and unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of this to convert small amounts into whole numbers, effectively raising prices by taking advantage of the situation.

Advocating Domestic Goods During Extraordinary Times. During these extraordinary times, various commodity prices have already risen compared to pre-war levels due to traffic congestion, supply and demand imbalances, and speculation. However, the increase in foreign goods prices is welcomed because it greatly benefits the sales of domestic goods. However, domestic manufacturers should not take the opportunity to raise prices, giving the public a bad impression. In the midst of these price increases, those with savings can cope, but ordinary wage earners and laborers already find it difficult to make a living and are constantly complaining.

Captured Portuguese Ships Transferred to Japanese Merchants: Unconfirmed

Portuguese Consulate Still Negotiating

More than ten Portuguese merchant ships, including "Meda," "Tombay," "Tonglu," "Tongqiao," "Hailong," and "Marie," have been detained by Japanese warships for two months. Despite repeated negotiations by the Portuguese Consulate with the Japanese side, there have been no results. It is rumored that the Japanese side has transferred ownership of the ships to Nisshin Kisen Kaisha to compensate for war losses. However, reporters from the "New News Agency" learned from the shipping companies that they have not received the above report. The Portuguese Consulate is continuing to negotiate with the Japanese side to safeguard its legitimate shipping rights in China.

Fifty Scout Groups:

Xu Zhengxiang's Martyrdom

Passed Away in Guilin

The 50th Scout Group of this city has served in the war zone with remarkable results. Yesterday, a report was received that Xu Zhengxiang, a member of the group, who was working on first aid transport for the Red Cross, passed away due to exhaustion from running around, contracting typhoid fever, which was not cured at the Guilin Provincial Hospital. He died at 6:05 PM on the 9th of this month. Xu was originally employed by the Waterworks Company, from Ningbo, 23 years old, married, and without children, but with parents still living. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, he voluntarily filled out a pledge, vowing to serve the country at the cost of his life. His dedication leading to his death is deeply mourned.

Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructions: Trademark Registration Procedures

Since the relevant industrial and commercial authorities in Shanghai have temporarily suspended operations, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to clarify the procedures for applying for trademark registration for the general industrial and commercial community, and to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, has published six trademark registration procedures based on current laws and implementing regulations in the Chamber's monthly commercial publication. It also includes samples of trademark exclusive right application forms, types A, B, and C, where type A is for applications where the mark has not been previously used, and type B is for marks that have already been used. The recently revised Trademark Law Implementing Rules, totaling forty articles, are also published in full in the publication.

### Japanese Consul General's Residence in Nanjing: Japanese Judge Dies of Poisoning; Two Cooks Flee After Being Poisoned

Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, Gao Guanwu, and other key figures of the puppet "Reformed Government," in order to ingratiate themselves with the Japanese side, held a banquet at the Japanese Consul General's residence in Nanjing on the evening of the 9th to welcome Kiyomizu Ruzaburo, a Foreign Ministry official from Japan. They took their seats at 7:00 PM. Just as they toasted with Shaoxing wine, the attendees showed signs of poisoning. Liang Hongzhi, the "President of the Executive Yuan," and Gao Guanwu, the "Mayor of Nanjing," were deeply affected by the poison. It is said that their lives are in danger. Among them, Miya Scorpionda and Fernan Yama (both transliterated), two young judges from the Japanese Consulate, were particularly severely poisoned, according to foreign sources. They died the next day (Saturday, the 10th). According to a Japanese newspaper report, two cooks from the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing fled without a trace after being poisoned.

### Foreign Exchange Tightening: Japan Expresses Unease; Japanese Shops Affected Most Severely; Ministry of Finance Plans Countermeasures

Reuters, Tokyo, December 12: The Asahi Shimbun recently published an article discussing the Sino-British Stabilization Fund Committee's sudden cessation of support for the legal tender on June 7th. It stated that Japan may retaliate against Britain's recent change in its "exchange rate policy in China." The Committee's move is particularly harmful to the business of Japanese shops in Shanghai. It is difficult to determine whether the cessation of support for the legal tender is due to the exhaustion of the Stabilization Fund or is a politically motivated attempt to harm Japan's economic policy in China. The Japanese Ministry of Finance is closely monitoring developments and is seriously considering countermeasures to deal with the situation. (Report from Hong Kong on the 13th of this newspaper) The closing price of legal tender for Hong Kong dollars on the evening of the 13th was 43.

Lu Ruiwu Suffers Loss and Grief: Donates Compensation to Relief Efforts

All Compensation After Retirement Dedicated to Social Welfare to Support Charitable Causes.

The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens' Group received a letter from Mr. Lu Ruiwu, which stated: "Unfortunately, East Asia has been devastated by war, the land suffers from devastation and shame, and the people suffer from displacement and hardship. Thanks to the help of colleagues, the masses of the helpless are supported, and you, gentlemen of the Association, have been wholeheartedly planning for the well-being of society, which I greatly admire. Regrettably, I have been burdened by work and have not fulfilled my responsibilities. Recently, my hometown has been unstable, and I have brought my family to Shanghai to seek refuge. Unexpectedly, last month, my young son was killed by a car. Having survived a close call, my heart was still chilled when misfortune struck my family, and I suffered loss and grief. After much consideration, I respectfully dedicate the 500 yuan received as compensation for the accident to society for charitable purposes. I am specially sending 200 yuan to the Association, along with this letter, and I hope that you will check and receive it. This is to fulfill the kindness of heaven and to help the refugees. This mark of sorrow is also for commemoration. Please do not regard it as generosity at another's expense. I respectfully wish you all the best."

### Deeply in Love with a Dancer: Fraudulently Obtaining US Dollars Continues; Chen Lingmei Consults Lawyer Yao to Woo Dancer; Yao, Due to Financial Difficulties, Conspires to Defraud a Large Sum; Complex and Bizarre Case Involving Many Relationships

Chen Lingmei, a retired employee of a bank, and Yao Ruilian, a lawyer, allegedly conspired on November 19th of last year to defraud the Baotai Bank on Sichuan Road of US$1,500. The case was discovered, and Chief Inspector Jiang Shangpei of the General Police Station's Chinese Detective Division arrested Chen and Yao, along with Chen's mistress, Shen Lili, a former dancer at the Dalu Dance Hall, as well as Zhang Zhaohan, Liu Kangsun, and three others, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Judge Meng Tingke specially convened a criminal trial in the Fourth Court to hear the case. Peng Xuehai, a lawyer hired by the Baotai Bank, appeared in court to bring a civil suit, requesting that the defendants be jointly and severally ordered to repay US$1,500. The defendant Yao Ruilian hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the police station, presented the case, stating that during the adjournment, it was discovered that the defendant Yao Ruilian had a person named Zheng Shunsheng residing at No. 37 Tongshou Lane on Datong Road, who had pledged a savings passbook of 5,300 yuan from the Kenyie Bank to Yao's Yong'an Bank for a loan of 1,500 yuan. When the term expired, Yao withdrew the deposit and used it privately. Although Zheng reported it to the police station at the time, because Yao's lawyer's office had persuaded Zheng, Zheng stated that he was unwilling to pursue the matter, so the police station did not add the case. Chen Lingmei, the defendant, previously worked at a bank. Chen danced at the Dalu Dance Hall (now known as Weigong), where he met the dancer Shen Lili (the second defendant). Over time, they fell in love and became engaged, but because Chen's family still had various problems, he consulted lawyer Yao Ruilian for assistance. At that time, Yao had established the Yong'an Bank in the Hadong Building, but due to a shortage of funds, she asked Chen for help and conspired a plan to defraud money. First, Chen instructed Zhang Zhaohan to rent houses at No. 308 Pushi Road and No. 19 Xilong, Jianye Lane, Fulvli Road, where Chen and Shen Lili resided separately. On November 18th of last year, room 273 of the Shanghai New Hotel on Jiujiang Road was booked. Yao Ruilian used 190 yuan in legal tender to purchase two remittance tickets from the Huitong Bank and the Yikang Money Shop, each for 100 yuan, and exchanged two remittance slips from the Guohua Bank. One slip was altered to 10,000 yuan, and the other was not used because the writing was damaged. They were handed over to Chen. The next day, the 19th, Yao went to a certain place to meet with Chen, saying that today, no matter what, the plan must be implemented. She instructed Chen to use the altered ticket as a decoy and not to sell it. Chen was forced to ask his colleague to call the Baotai Money Shop, instructing them to send US$1,500, and also called the Changtai Money Shop, instructing them to send JP¥1,500. After the call, the Changtai Money Shop first ordered its staff to send JP¥ to a certain bank, but because Changtai did not want to accept the remittance slip, the transaction did not go through. Soon, Zhang Yu and two other staff members sent US$ to the meeting place. Chen's colleague instructed them to contact Chen Lingmei. Chen instructed the staff to wait in the reception room, then took the money into the room. Unexpectedly, he escaped through the side door and went to the Shanghai Hotel, where he exchanged US$200 for 1,241 yuan in cash. He then withdrew 500 yuan and gave it to Zhang Zhaohan, who forwarded it to his mother. At that time, Yao Ruilian had also arrived. In addition to giving Yao US$800, Chen entrusted Zhang Zhaohan to keep the remaining funds. Zhang gave 150 yuan in national currency to Shen Lili as expenses. The next day, Yao Ruilian went to Jianye Lane to meet Chen, bringing envelopes and stationery, instructing Chen to write a letter to the Baotai Money Shop. The draft of the letter was written by Yao. On the 21st, Zhang Zhaohan was busy with work and could not handle it alone, so he obtained Chen's consent and introduced the defendant Liu Kangsun to help. From then on, Liu went to Chen's house every day. Later, every time Lawyer Yao went to Chen's house, Chen always asked Yao to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Yao kept making promises until the night of November 29th, when Yao used a 600-yuan check from a certain bank from her Yong'an Bank, with a date of December 3rd, to exchange for cash from Chen. Chen again instructed Zhang Zhaohan to exchange US$100 for 500 yuan in national currency and give it to Yao, who issued a receipt. However, the check could not be cashed when it was due. On the 30th of the month, the Baotai Money Shop published a wanted notice for Chen Lingmei. Chen was very anxious when he saw the notice. Fearing that the news would leak out from his residence, he entrusted Liu Kangsun to rent a house at No. 32 Anren Lane, No. 1403 Aivenyi Road. On January 14th of this year, he vacated the houses on Pushi Road and Fulvli Road and moved in with Shen Lili on Aivenyi Road. Yao Ruilian also visited from time to time and showed Chen a savings passbook of over 5,000 yuan from the Kenyie Bank (the one pledged by Zheng Shunsheng), saying that the matter could be resolved and that he did not need to worry. Later, because Yao repeatedly made promises, Chen had a conflict with her, and Yao stopped visiting. The secret of Chen and others was learned by a Mrs. Zhu at No. 10 in the same lane, who took the opportunity to threaten them. Chen had no choice but to invite Yao to come and discuss how to deal with it. As a result, Yao gave Mrs. Zhu 200 yuan in cash and a check for 100 yuan. Although the matter was settled, the check was again returned when it was due. After Mrs. Zhu negotiated, Yao paid 30 yuan to settle the matter. The check has also been cancelled. After Chen Lingmei committed this crime, all the remaining funds, except for his expenses, were used by Yao and Zhang Zhaohan. Therefore, he lived a life of misery, and all his clothes were pawned. The long robe he is wearing today also belongs to Yao Ruilian, and so on. When questioned, Chen Lingmei's testimony was the same as above. Shen Lili and Liu Kangsun both claimed to be unaware of the fraud. Zhang Zhaohan admitted that he did not participate in the fraud, but admitted that Chen gave him the money, and that except for the money he spent on his behalf, the remaining 1,800 yuan had been used by him. When questioned, Yao Ruilian flatly denied any fraudulent behavior, claiming that she knew nothing about the matter. According to the testimony of Sui Jingwen, the second landlord on Aivenyi Road, and the maid Wu Xiangshi, Yao Ruilian did visit Chen frequently. After reviewing the testimony, the court ordered that the case be adjourned until Tuesday afternoon of next week. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Subtenant Demands Rent Increase: Assaults Doctor; The Perpetrators Detained for Investigation

Chen Guanjin, a pediatrician from Shaoxing, 32 years old, rented the main room of the house of Dai Ruhai (34 years old), a Tianjin native, subtenant at No. 15, Lane 285, Bair Road in the French Concession. He practiced medicine there, charging 45 yuan in national currency per month. Recently, Chen's medical practice has flourished, with many patients. Dai Ruhai, the subtenant, demanded that Chen increase the rent by 15 yuan per month, totaling 60 yuan. Chen refused, leading to an argument. At 5:00 PM on the 12th, Dai Ruhai, the subtenant, clashed again, citing Chen's refusal to increase the rent and demanding that Chen move out immediately. Dai then colluded with his family members Dai Zushang, Dai Yingqi, Han Jizhi, and Zhao Suichun to beat Chen, causing injuries. Chen reported to the French police station, who dispatched detectives to arrest the perpetrators. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the French Concession administrative authorities, presented the case, prosecuting them for assault. The plaintiff, Chen Guanjin, the victim, did not arrive because of serious injuries being treated in the hospital. Judge Wu Kechou ordered each of the defendants to provide a shop guarantee of 100 yuan and adjourned the case until the plaintiff recovered from his injuries. However, because the defendants were guests in Shanghai and had no acquaintances to provide shop guarantees, they paid 100 yuan in cash each as a guarantee to be released and await trial.

### Bodyguard of Gambling Den: Convicted and Refuses to Accept Verdict; Appeal Hearing Scheduled for Sentencing

Xie Zhiguang, a Chinese detective from the Diswei Road Police Station, Detective Zhao Lianbi, and others, arrested six robbers on Yuyuan Road on March 19th of this year: Xu Yongquan, Zhu Yunlong, Shen Yougen, Chen Haibin, and Jiang Xiangyun. They also found a Mauser pistol, two Browning pistols, and a Mars pistol at Zhu Jiaku's house on Hague Road. Two of the pistols were stolen from the home of Hua Butou Yao Jiagui at No. 339 Daxi Road on February 17th of this year. It was later found that the defendants had committed two robbery cases and one kidnapping case. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. According to Wang Yushan's confession, he was working as a bodyguard for Shao Liangeng, the owner of the Rongsheng Company gambling den in Huxi. The Mauser pistol that was found was given to him by Shao Liangeng. Judge Xiao Peishen sentenced Jiang Xianghong to eight years in prison, and the others, including Xu Shuiquan, to life imprisonment. However, Xu and others refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court president Yu heard the case in an en banc hearing yesterday and ordered that the sentencing be announced on the 16th.

### Youth Dies from Poisoning

At 12:30 PM yesterday, a traveler who identified himself as "Sang Xing" at Room 222 of the Far Eastern Hotel locked himself in his room and committed suicide by taking poison. The waiter discovered that he was pale and knew something was wrong, so he immediately reported it to the police station. The Zhabei Police Station dispatched Chinese police officer No. 134 to escort him to the hospital, but he died before he could be saved due to the severe poisoning. The youth was about 30 years old and was only wearing shorts. The reason for his suicide was likely due to economic pressure.

### Rickshaw Puller Dies Suddenly

At 9:45 PM last night, Sun Shuping was pulling a rickshaw (No. 6681) when he suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness at the intersection of Henan Road and Sanma Road.

### Collapsed House Injures Four

A house at No. 1, Lane 403, Mintishi Ni Yin Road, in the French Concession, was destroyed by fire two months ago. Recently, the landlord hired a large number of workers to repair it. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, the house suddenly collapsed. Four workers, Yang Heshang (29 years old), Qiu Guiyuan (33 years old), Wang Maoying (16 years old), and Jiang Shunlong (40 years old), were unable to escape and were seriously injured. Samaritans transported the four to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is said that Jiang Shunlong's injuries are serious and his life may be in danger.

### Murder Caused by Buying Vegetables: Two Culprits Sentenced

Wang A'gen (26 years old), a Ningbo native who contracted catering services at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, carried a vegetable basket to the Fujian Road vegetable market to buy vegetables on the morning of the 6th of this month. When he arrived at the entrance of the Tongchengji Vegetable Shop at No. 593 on that road, he saw Zhu Hongyuan and Zhao Shiyin from Jiangyin buying amaranth. They could not agree on a price. Because he also needed the vegetables, he took the initiative to raise the price, willing to pay six cents per catty. Zhu and Zhao were very dissatisfied, and a big argument broke out. Unexpectedly, Wang A'gen was punched to death by Zhu Hongyuan. The patrolling Chinese police officers rushed to the scene and arrested Zhu and Zhao. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the two defendants to the First Special Court's First Criminal Court for prosecution and stated that the deceased was found to be obese, but suffered from heart disease. There were no obvious injuries to the skin, the blood vessels in the body were swollen, and the blood vessels exploded after being stimulated, leading to death. Judge Xiao Xiefen held a hearing and sentenced Zhu Hongyuan and Zhao Shizhen to eight months of imprisonment for causing death by injury.

### Extortionists Sentenced

Youthful gangsters Xu Gongxia, Zhang Liben, Hou Huiqun, Shen Qun, Huang Yiren, and others recently used the name of the Zhongyi Jiuguo Chujian Tuan (Loyal and Righteous Anti-Japanese Eradication Group) to send a letter to Chen Futian, manager of Chen Fuji Transportation Company at No. 17 Guangdong Road, threatening him, claiming that Chen was transporting goods for a certain party and making a lot of profit, and demanding 5,000 yuan in legal tender. They scheduled a meeting to discuss the matter. Chen reported the matter to the Xinzha Police Station, who dispatched detectives Gong Youwei and Wang Rudong to arrest Xu and four others and send them to the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Xiao announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. Xu Gongxia was sentenced to two years and eight months of imprisonment for attempted joint extortion. Zhang Liben, Hou Huiqun, Shen Qun, and Huang Yiren were sentenced to two years of imprisonment each for attempted joint extortion. The three letters of extortion, one note, and one bullet were confiscated.

### Two Thieves Sentenced to Imprisonment

### A Prostitution Den Set Up Inside a Sugar Store: Two Male and Female Offenders Sentenced

The Quantai Sugar Store at No. 51 Yanghang Street in the French Concession is owned by Yu Xikang from Ningbo. A few days ago, the Anti-Narcotics Department of the French Police Station learned that the store was operating a large-scale prostitution den, so they dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to search the premises. They seized three opium pipes each, a large quantity of opium and opium paste, and arrested Yu's older sister, Zhang Yu, and a store employee, Liu Xingbao, and sent them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police station stated that Yu Xikang was highly suspected in the case and requested that Liu Xingbao and Zhang Yu be remanded in custody for a further hearing. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the hearing was resumed. Yu Xikang sent someone to the court, claiming that he had gone to another port for business and could not attend the court. Judge Jiang briefly questioned them and sentenced Zhang Yu to three months of imprisonment for knowingly possessing opium paraphernalia, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. Liu Xingbao was fined 180 yuan, which could be commuted to labor service at the rate of two yuan per day. Zhang Yu paid a 260-yuan bond and Liu Xingbao paid a 140-yuan bond to be released pending further hearings.

### A Gang of Thieves Were Not Satisfied With Their Greed and Continued to Extort, Leading to Their Arrest; After Obtaining a Huge Sum of Money Through Robbery, They Sent a Letter of Extortion, Arranging a Time to Receive the Money and Were Caught in One Fell Swoop

Wu Jiyu, formerly an assistant manager of the Hefeng Salt Company in Tianjin, was a native of Suzhou and resided at No. 10 Tai'an Lane, Baylor Road, in the French Concession of this city. Wu is currently in Hong Kong, and his wife, Wang, and others reside in Shanghai. At 9:00 AM on the 4th of this month, four robbers suddenly broke into Wu's Shanghai residence. Three of them, holding handguns, claimed to be delivering gifts and, showing their guns, forbade anyone to make a sound. They confined Wu's family members and servants to a downstairs room, with one robber watching them. The others went upstairs to rummage through boxes and chests, stealing diamond rings, pearls, clothing, and cash, totaling a value of 3,065 yuan. The search and robbery lasted two hours. Before escaping, the robbers ordered the victim to gather 2,000 yuan in cash within three days and send it to a certain location. After saying this, the robbers fled in a rush. Afterwards, the victim drew up a list of lost items and reported it to the French police, requesting an investigation. On the afternoon of the 7th, at 6:00 PM, Wu's wife, Wang, received another threatening letter from the gang, delivered by the post office, demanding money. On the 9th, the robbers called Wu Wang again, agreeing to meet at the intersection of Route Pichon and Avenue Lafayette to hand over the money. Wu Wang reported this information to the French police. On the day before yesterday, Inspector Li Xianyang, along with detectives Shen Jinshu, Zhang Xiaofa, Jiang Jia, and others, disguised themselves and went to the location specified by the robbers, waiting for them to come and collect the money. The detectives had not been at the location long when they saw a person approaching slowly. The detectives immediately arrested him. He confessed that his name was Wang Zhizheng (38 years old, from Taizhou). He also said that there were accomplices at No. 209, Liang'an Apartment, No. 109, behind the Grosse Road (now South Soochow Road) police station. The detectives immediately took Wang to Liang'an Apartment to arrest the gang. However, the gang had already become aware of the situation and jumped out of the window to flee. The detectives chased them to the intersection of Woosung Road and Woosung Creek, arresting the gang member Zhu Zhicheng (29 years old, from Changzhou). They then chased them to the intersection of Woosung Road and Avenue Frelupt, arresting Ma Yuzhen (34 years old, from Tianjin) and Cai Xiaozheng (27 years old, from Yixing). They were taken to the police station, where they confessed that the handguns were hidden in the home of Wang Xie (37 years old, from Shaoxing) at No. 9 Xinmin Lane, Route Amiral Bayle. The detectives then went to Wang Xie's home and arrested Wang Xie and Wang Yankang (34 years old, from Suzhou). A search revealed no handguns, only a stack of wooden boards used to hide the guns (more than a dozen boards stacked together with a hollow space in the middle for hiding the guns). Furthermore, the arrested Cai Xiaozheng confessed that Liu Bingyao (22 years old, from Suzhou, the nephew of the victim Wu Jiyu's brother) had provided the information for the case involving Wu Wang's home. Liu was hiding in Room 43 of the Southeast Hotel on Rue Brenier de Montmorand. The detectives then worked with the Xinzha police station to dispatch detectives to the Southeast Hotel on Rue Brenier de Montmorand and arrested Liu Bingyao. They were taken back to the police station. In total, seven male and female criminals were arrested. The details have already been briefly reported in the newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent the criminals to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. Judge Miao Qingbang took the bench for questioning. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer for the French Concession authorities, stated the case, saying that the defendants were arrested for robbery and extortion, and the police had not yet completed the investigation. He requested that the defendants be detained and the case be adjourned for further investigation. The court verified the report, asked the defendants their names, ages, and hometowns, and ordered that the case be adjourned until June 27. The defendants were taken into custody.

### Counterfeit Money Offenders Apprehended, Brought to Court for Questioning Yesterday; Main Culprit Yao Huaiqing Still at Large

Gao Huixian, a Chinese detective for the Gordon Road police station, learned on the afternoon of the day before yesterday that someone was selling counterfeit banknotes for profit at Room 13 of the Huxi Hotel, No. 12, Lane 229, Avenue du Roi Albert. He disguised himself as a guest and went to Room 13 of the hotel, where he apprehended Liu Jinkui, a native of Shandong (56 years old). He seized a total of 100 yuan in counterfeit banknotes, including one-yuan and five-yuan denominations from the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. After questioning, he learned that

these counterfeit banknotes

were purchased from Ding Zhanwei, a fellow villager residing at No. 319, Columbia Road, Fahua Town. Detective Gao, along with the criminal Liu, went to that location and arrested Ding. Ding confessed that a large amount of counterfeit money was hidden in the home of Yang Zijian, a native of Zhenjiang, at No. 15, Yongyu Lane, Route Amiral Bayle, in the French Concession. They then went to that address and, together with French police officers, arrested Yang. They seized counterfeit currency from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, totaling

7,100

yuan. Liu, Ding, and Yang, along with a small suitcase of counterfeit money, were taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Tianyin, a police lawyer, explained the case, stating that the investigation revealed that the main culprit was Yao Huaiqing, a native of Nanjing (formerly a printer), and Ding Zhanwei's wife, Wang Guiying, were still at large. The three defendants in this case had previously committed

the same crime

and served prison sentences. He requested an extension of the investigation. A portion of the counterfeit money from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications was presented for inspection. Detective Gao then reported the details of the case's investigation. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the three criminals, Liu, Ding, and Yang, and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review in seven days.

The Unique Features of Ford and Mercury Automobiles

Since its inception, the Ford Motor Company has produced many excellent vehicles. Among them, the 1939 Ford and Mercury automobiles should be considered the best. The Mercury's engine outwardly resembles the 85-horsepower engine, but it is not. It is capable of producing ten more horsepower, and its weight is only seven pounds more than the 85-horsepower engine. Moreover, all Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln Zephyr automobiles use baked enamel paint, which is durable and long-lasting. The Ford V8 has a ventilated V-shaped windshield that other cars do not have, providing clear visibility. In addition, the interior and exterior of the car doors are equipped with curved handles. The top of the front seat backrest is fitted with soft padding. In the event of an unfortunate car accident, passengers in the rear seat are protected from injury. The car is also equipped with foot-controlled headlight dimming for convenient use while driving. Furthermore, this year's Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln Zephyr automobiles are specially equipped with door latches. This simple device allows the doors to open wide for easy entry and exit. All of these features ensure safety.

Ample Supplies of Firewood and Charcoal: No Need to Worry About Fuel Shortages

The city's fuel supply mainly consists of coal balls, white coal, firewood, and charcoal. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the source of domestic coal has been cut off, and the city relies entirely on coal shipments from India and other places. Due to the recent tightening of foreign exchange, the prices of white coal and coal balls have both risen as a result. However, the price of firewood and charcoal has fallen slightly compared to before, as large quantities have been shipped from Wenzhou in recent days. As the city has sufficient supplies and smooth supply routes, there is no cause for panic regarding fuel.

### Letters

To the Editor: We are instructed by our clients Chen Bingwen and Sun Shiqi to state that we have read an item in the local news section of your newspaper dated June 12, regarding Chen Bingwen and Sun Shiqi allegedly abducting a woman from a respectable family. This is completely inconsistent with the facts, and we are specially commissioned by our lawyers to write to your newspaper office requesting a correction to set the record straight. The circumstances at the time were as follows: Chen Bingwen and Ms. Wei Wenxiu had known each other for several years as neighbors and friends. Chen Bingwen fled to the countryside after the Shanghai Incident and only recently returned to Shanghai. He met Wei Wenxiu and, due to important matters, went to the Kaiwuling Apartments, accompanied by his friend Sun Shiqi, to discuss them. That day, French Concession police were searching rooms there, and they were suspected, which led to their wrongful arrest and being taken to the police station. After investigation by the police station, it was found that Chen Bingwen and Sun Shiqi had no criminal behavior or evidence, so they were released immediately as law-abiding citizens. This is completely inconsistent with the facts reported in your newspaper. Fearing that the outside world would not know the truth and misunderstand, we have specially written to your newspaper requesting an immediate correction. We remain, Shen Bao Guan Zhong Bi Xiansheng Taijian (Respectfully yours, Mr. Editor of the Shen Bao), Representative Lawyer Xi Xiangguan, June 13.

To the Editor: We are instructed by our client Mr. Qu Songqing to state that we have seen in the new column of your newspaper dated the 12th of this month an article regarding Han Funan, Liu Wuzhai, and myself being involved in a boat rental lawsuit. This is very inconsistent with the facts. Han Funan's boat could not be towed out after the 813 Incident because it was moored near the battlefield of Tianshenggang. After repeated requests, the Shanghai Ship Transport Company was asked to find a way. They agreed to help as a favor and made an introduction. Subsequently, Shan Han Funan and his boat's captain Cai Juming accompanied the Japanese from the Shanghai Ship Transport Company to Tianshenggang several times before the boat was towed out. Afterwards, the boat joined the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company as a share, which was also entirely negotiated by Han Funan with the Shanghai Steamship Company and had nothing to do with me. Therefore, the wages of the boat's crew and the oil and yarn used on the boat should be borne by the boat owner and were also changed to be supplied by the Shanghai Steamship Company. This is undeniable, so how could it be arbitrarily implicated and mistakenly believed that I was involved? Fortunately, the facts are all there and will be revealed. The boat rental incident involving Han Funan and Liu Wuzhai was originally for other purposes. At that time, I was only acting as a guarantor for Liu Wuzhai due to our friendship. How could it be that I conspired to continue the lease? Moreover, the boat had already been legally returned to the Shanghai Pier and properly handed over before July 17 last year, with various evidences to be checked. The first instance ruled that Han Funan's boat had already been recovered and should not have filed a lawsuit. Therefore, the verdict was a loss. Although the lawsuit continues, the truth will eventually come to light. It is easy to understand who is right and who is wrong in this matter. The reports in the newspaper are inaccurate, and because they affect my reputation, I cannot remain silent. I request that your lawyer write a letter of correction. Respectfully, Lawyer Tang Ying, June 13.

Yesterday, your newspaper reported that the date of our Association's burning offering ceremony was the 15th, which was mistaken for the 16th. The initiation ceremony on the 16th (April 28th of the lunar calendar) was mistaken for the 17th. We hereby request that you correct this. Respectfully, The Dabai Umbrella Cover Prajna Dharma Assembly, June 13.

### An Overview of Vocational Education in China (6) Vocational Education in the Border Provinces to Be Completed Within Three Years; Both the Number of Vocational Schools and Students Have Increased

National Vocational Schools

Since the central government has made every effort to promote vocational education, vocational schools in various provinces and cities have been increasing in number. However, most are limited by funds, and many are simple and crude, and the content cannot be enriched. In addition to the Ministry of Education sending personnel to inspect, supervise, and urge improvements, the Central Industrial Vocational School was established in Nanjing in 1936 to serve as a model. The departments established were mechanical engineering, applied chemistry, civil engineering, and electrical engineering. After the August 13th Incident in 1937, the school moved from Nanjing to Wanxian, Sichuan Province. In 1938, it moved from Wanxian to Chongqing. There are currently eight undergraduate levels and two training levels, with a total of more than 400 students.

The Central Nursing and Midwifery Vocational School was originally affiliated with the Central Hospital of the Ministry of Health. In 1936, it was transferred directly under the Ministry of Education, and the funding was listed separately. The Central Midwifery School moved from Nanjing to Anqing, and in 1938, it moved from Anqing to Chongqing. There are currently four levels, with a total of more than 80 students. The Central Nursing School moved from Nanjing with the Central Hospital to Changsha, and in 1938, it moved from Changsha to Guiyang. There are currently more than 60 students.

In addition, the National First Midwifery School and the National Tongji University Affiliated Senior Industrial Vocational School were established around 1931 and 1932. The classes and students are still developing. The Senior Medical Vocational Department of the National Guiyang Medical College was established in 1937 and recruits students from all levels of midwifery and nursing schools in the war zone. The scale is roughly in place.

Vocational Education in the Border Provinces

In 1938, the Ministry of Education, in order to vigorously promote agricultural and industrial vocational education in the northwest and southwest provinces, specially promulgated the Plan for Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Education in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. It is divided into three regions: Northwest, Sichuan, Kang, and Southwest. The important principles are as follows: (1) Each province in each region should, with reference to the province's agricultural and industrial occupations and the distribution of raw materials, stipulate the location and subjects for setting up higher and elementary agricultural and industrial vocational schools. (2) The facilities of vocational schools can first establish factories or farms when necessary, depending on their needs, train a small number of apprentices, and gradually expand into schools. (3) All facilities of vocational schools should be planned and guided by the departments and bureaus in conjunction with higher education and production institutions of the same nature. (4) This regional promotion plan should be completed within three years. The above plan requires all provinces to quickly consult with relevant agencies to formulate implementation plans and submit them to the Ministry for approval. Most provinces have already complied.

Cooperation and Guidance

In order to seek a practical connection between construction and education, to communicate supply and demand needs, and to increase the efficiency of education and business, the Central Government formulated the Outline for Cooperation Between Vocational Schools and Construction Agencies in 1936. All schools were instructed to detail the methods for assigning students to practice with off-campus production practice agencies and to guide and assess the results of the practice. In the same year, the Measures for Establishing Advisory Committees for Vocational Schools were promulgated, requiring all schools to hire five to seven experts or leaders from the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and medical sectors who are of the same nature as the school to form a committee to discuss matters concerning students' service ethics, spiritual training, textbook selection, practical guidance, and employment. In 1937, the central government established the Construction-Education Cooperation Committee, which was composed of representatives from the departments and commissions of education, economy, transportation, military administration, internal affairs, and aviation, and was presided over by the Ministry of Education. Its tasks were to investigate various technical talents, compile various statistics, formulate plans for setting up subjects in vocational schools and specialist colleges at all levels and teaching and training programs, formulate liaison methods for education and construction national defense agencies, and coordinate the employment of graduates. There were considerable results.

In 1939, in order to improve the effectiveness of vocational school facilities, the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of Measures for Zoning and Guiding Vocational Schools in Provinces and Cities. The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should closely liaise with specialist colleges and universities and production, economic, military, and industrial institutions inside and outside the province, and divide vocational school districts. They should invite specialists from the above schools and institutions to be responsible for academic and technical guidance, so that vocational schools have the convenience of assistance and supervision at all times. All personnel, administration, and teaching must be based on the opinions of the guidance agencies.

Vocational Education Statistics

Since the government has worked hard to promote vocational education in China, the following statistics can be obtained up to one year before the Anti-Japanese War. Most of the nursing and midwifery schools are not included. (1) Number of schools: 408. (2) Number of classes: 1,736. (3) Number of students: 50,205. (4) Number of teachers and staff: 7,881. (5) Amount of funding: 8,228,176 yuan. The above statistics are about one-quarter higher than the 312 schools at the time of the implementation of the standards for the establishment and funding of secondary schools in 1934. Other items such as student funding have also increased by one-quarter. In addition, the equipment, teaching, and employment of the schools, although they cannot be expressed in quantity, seem to have made considerable progress based on the observations of the Ministry of Education. (End)

### Strict Implementation of Graduation Examinations in Various Secondary Schools in This City: Graduation Examinations to Be Held After Term Examinations; School Principals to Supervise Examinations Personally, Replacing the Joint Entrance Examination System

In this city, various secondary schools, regarding each graduation examination, before the war, the competent authorities used to hold a joint entrance examination system. After our army moved west, the joint graduation examinations of various schools were suspended due to environmental reasons. It is now learned that after the unanimous decision of various schools in this city this semester to continue to follow the Ministry of Education's instructions, schools have been conducting term examinations for graduating classes in recent days. Starting next week, graduation examinations will be held again, at which time the principals of each school and important military officials will personally supervise. It is said that the reason for such caution and strictness is to replace the joint entrance examination system. As for the methods for issuing graduation certificates from various secondary schools, the competent authorities have already announced that each school must compile a list of the graduates' academic performance over the years at the school, and submit the list for verification when issuing certificates, in order to exchange them for official diplomas. Otherwise, they will not be recognized in the future. It is also reported that the Ministry of Education, in view of the fact that a small number of schools in Shanghai had indiscriminately enrolled students, in order to learn from past mistakes, recently issued a strict order to all schools that the enrollment of students in the next semester must strictly comply with laws and regulations. Students must have valid credentials for admission and must not skip grades or levels. It is said that various schools have already received this circular.

(2) The school is divided into senior and junior high school departments. The senior high school offers courses in commerce, civil engineering, applied chemistry, and mechanics, and admits both male and female students. The senior high school normal school department only admits female students. The junior high school offers courses in commerce, civil engineering, applied chemistry, and mechanics, and admits both male and female students. The length of study is five years.

Preparatory Situation

The preparation of the school is currently the responsibility of the Production and Construction Association, with Dai Ce, the general secretary of the association and vice principal of the China-Belgium Construction Vocational School, as the director. The preparatory committee is currently giving much consideration to the division of subjects and the implementation plan, while also paying attention to the future employment of students. Dai Ce left Shanghai on April 28 for Kunming to discuss with various parties the employment prospects of students and the school's development plan in the southwest region. It is reported that the Five Provinces Highway Bureau has proposed to entrust the school with the task of training management personnel.

Dai's Telegram

Because the school is a large-scale vocational school, the preparation is quite time-consuming. At present, there are no suitable houses in Shanghai, so it is unlikely to open and enroll students in Shanghai in the short term. However, the establishment of the school is a certainty, the only difference is the timing. The preparatory office of the school recently received a telegram from Dai Ce, stating that in order to adapt to the environment of the southwest, it is planned to set up a branch school in the Yunnan area first.

Science and Life

### Elevation and Promotion

— Ji Qian

Science is sufficient to benefit the country, which is recognized by all with knowledge. The reason why it can produce the greatest effect and deeply benefit the country and society must be that, within the country, specialized knowledge and skills are particularly developed, and all important national issues can be solved by this. It must also be that common sense, habits, thoughts, and spirit of science are widespread in society, and the people of the whole country are brought into the right track of science. Then the people are rich in self-governance ability, the society has stable order, prospers day by day, and outstanding elements increase because of this. In the competitive world, it can stand forever without being eliminated by evolution. In a word: That is, specialized science must be promoted as much as possible, and the common sense of science should be promoted as much as possible. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the Englishman Huxley was deeply aware of this meaning and devoted his life to this path. At that time, science was already very developed in England. The contributions of specialized masters such as Lyell, Darwin, Hooker, Wallace, Thomson (i.e., Sir Kelvin), Tyndall, and Golden shocked the world and opened a new era in the scientific community. Mr. He was a close friend of these people, and his personal contribution to science had great value. He worked hard all his life and devoted all his strength to advanced research. However, in the midst of his busy schedule, he still engaged in the work of promoting science education, giving lectures for workers, and publishing countless simple scientific texts in domestic newspapers for all those who did not study science. Throughout his life, he almost used all his time and energy to promote science and write specialized works. As a result, British society was greatly affected, and common scientific sense was almost a household name. The intellectual level of the people increased, the education system improved, and countless experts emerged in the country to meet the urgent needs of the country. Since the nineteenth century, England has become the first strong country in the world. Today, our country needs science everywhere. Young people in the country who are determined to engage in the cause of saving the country and are deeply interested in science should strive for advanced attainments on the one hand, and assist in the popularization of science on the other hand, taking the example of what Mr. He did.

### Lamp and Candle

— Xin Zhi

Burning the midnight oil to obtain light, the use of lamps and candles has been around for a long time. They all stem from the act of burning. However, electric lamps have pioneered a unique path in obtaining light. Early people knew how to obtain light by burning, so they collected natural combustible materials and burned them. The use of oil lamps is likely older than candles. The earliest candles were made from animal fats. A reed stalk was used as a wick, dipped in melted tallow, again and again, to form the candle. When chemical knowledge progressed a hundred years ago, the method of making candles also went from crude to refined. The chemical composition of fatty oils was studied by the French person Huifu Lou. It was learned that although the appearance of all animal and vegetable fats is quite different, they all have a similar internal structure, and are actually compounds of glycerol and organic acids, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid. If animal fat such as tallow is used to make candles, the compound of glycerol and oleic acid will cause the candle to tear due to its ease of melting. And when burning, glycerol becomes a kind of malodorous substance. Therefore, in modern candle making, tallow is first boiled together with acid-adjusted water to separate the fat from the fibrous material. Then lime is added and subjected to high-heat steam to decompose into glycerol and various organic acids, namely stearic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid. After distillation, it is pressed to remove the oleic acid. The remaining solid contains mostly stearic acid or "Si Ding". A little paraffin can be added to make the raw material for candle making. The candles made are white and hard, do not stain the fingers, burn brightly without smoke, and do not tear, which is much better than the old tallow candles.

Paraffin can also be used to make candles. However, it is easily softened when heated, which is not as good as those made of stearic acid. Paraffin is a mixture of various hydrogen and carbon compounds. Its properties are quite different from those of fatty acids. It is obtained from petroleum or made from brown coal (German method). It can only be used to make candles after being refined. In addition, beeswax is very similar to oil and fat in nature, and has also been used to make candles. Candles made from whale oil are used as a standard for measuring light intensity because of their large and uniform flames. An electric light bulb measured in candlepower is derived from the whale oil candle.

Although the materials for making candles are all combustible, they cannot burn unless they become gas. Therefore, the temperature must be high enough to cause it to vaporize before it can burn and form a flame. When a candle first burns, the oleic acid or wax on the wick gasifies and burns, and a bright flame is immediately seen. However, it soon weakens. It must wait for the candle oil in the lower part to melt before it can shine again. The burning oil rises along the wick by capillary action, the same action as a roll of paper standing upright in water, with the entire roll being soaked. The candle oil near the flame is vaporized by heat, and when ignited, it becomes a flame. The surrounding air flows due to the heat of the flame and rises in a cluster. The surroundings of the candle are kept cold and do not melt, forming a tray for holding oil. The oil does not flow out of the opening for this reason.

In the past, candle wicks had to be trimmed from time to time. The reason for this is that the candle wick is surrounded by oil vapor and cannot come into contact with oxygen, so it does not burn fully. Standing upright in the flame, the candle oil rises along it and cannot be completely burned. If the candle wick is not cut off, the candle flame will be dim and smoky, so it must be cut. When the French person Gong Baishi invented the use of gauze as a wick, it was no longer necessary to cut it after burning. If the wick is long, it curls up, and when it is curled, it is in contact with the air and burns out naturally. The thickness and tightness of the wick must also be appropriate to achieve a satisfactory result. A wick that has been treated with saltpeter can further prevent the candle from smoking and being cinder-free (i.e., no candle flowers).

The oil burned in oil lamps was originally vegetable oil. After the discovery of petroleum, which was cheaper, it was gradually used to replace vegetable oil. Petroleum is extracted from wells dug in the ground. It is formed by the long-term heat and pressure of marine animals and plants from ancient times. It contains various compounds of carbon and hydrogen, some of which are gases that escape from the ground, which is natural gas. Some are liquids and solids. Therefore, petroleum is steamed in a distiller. The products obtained when heated to between 40 degrees Celsius and 90 degrees Celsius are gasoline. The products obtained between 90 degrees Celsius and 120 degrees Celsius are volatile oil. The products obtained between 120 degrees Celsius and 150 degrees Celsius are light oil. The products obtained between 150 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius are lamp oil, namely kerosene or petroleum oil. The products obtained later are machine oil, Vaseline, and paraffin. All of the above are mixtures of hydrocarbon groups. The simplest of the gases is called marsh gas, which is the gas that is emitted when the mud at the bottom of the pond is stirred in the pond, which can burn when it encounters fire. It is also the main component of natural gas.

If kerosene does not have sufficient air when burning, it will not be fully oxidized, so there will be smoky flames. A lamp with a glass cover and a sufficient supply of oxygen must be used. The lamp wick that is in the shape of a circle must also have a hollow tube so that the inside of the flame can also come into contact with the air. This is the principle of the structure of modern kerosene lamps.

Wolf One

An Englishman, traveling in Asturia, saw a group of horses chasing for water and grass, scattered on the hillside. Suddenly, several wolves arrived, trying to devour their young. The old horses quickly formed a ring, with the young ones surrounded in the middle, and the heads of the old horses all facing outwards. The wolves approached menacingly. A wolf rushed in to bite, but the old horse facing it kicked it to death with its forelegs. So they held on for a while, and the wolves knew that they could not easily invade, so they left.

Wolf Two

Also, in the mountains of Croutia, a shepherd boy was herding pigs when he encountered two wolves. Frightened and not knowing what to do, he quickly abandoned his pigs and hid. He then saw his pigs gather into a wedge-shaped formation and slowly advance towards the wolves, their back manes standing up and making deep, angry hissing sounds from time to time. One wolf saw that its anger could not be offended and immediately fled. The other wolf scrambled up a large tree, and the pigs surrounded it in a circle under the tree. Seeing that it was forced, the wolf wanted to break out, and suddenly jumped down from the tree. The pigs squeezed and knocked it down, and fought hard, teeth and hooves were added at the same time, and it died in a moment.

Wolf Three

Darwin also said that bison can help each other to defend against insults. Whenever they are invaded by wolves, they always place their young in the center. The old bulls all bear the brunt, making angry looks, and the horns of their heads can be used as weapons to resist the enemy. The wolves fear their strength, knowing that there is no hope if they get close, and although they are eager to attack, they hesitate and cannot succeed.

The Stranger in the Studio wrote: How important is unity! In times of peace, it can bring the benefit of friendship, and in times of crisis, it can avoid the disaster of being defeated one by one. Horses, cattle, and pigs are still like this, can people be inferior to animals?

### New York World's Fair Visitor Counter

— Ye Ren

An American manufacturer of "cash counting machines" built the world's largest counting machine, installed at the recent opening of the New York World's Fair, to record the number of visitors each day. Every time a visitor enters the fairgrounds gate, the machine rings and the recording plate turns, adding one to the count. The machine is forty feet high, installed on the roof of the manufacturer's pavilion, and rotates slowly on a turntable, so that the six-foot-high illuminated numerical digits on top of the machine are visible to everyone in the entire fairgrounds day and night.

### "Ze Gui Mo"

— Qiao Xia Ke

I remember that the old teacher of the Jia clan school in "Dream of the Red Chamber" once gave this stereotyped essay topic. Now that times have changed, stereotyped essays are naturally out of the question. The "Mo" referred to here neither wants to praise Mozi by following the original meaning, nor dares to be overly sensitive and take Mussolini as the subject. So, Mo is X, is Y, temporarily used as an algebraic symbol.

Human psychology must have something to rely on, whether it is religion, or an ideology, or like a martyr who dies for fame, or like a greedy person who dies for wealth. It is okay to say it is faith, and it is also okay to say it is superstition. Once it loses its support, it often feels like a lone boat in the sea, with a sense of endless wandering. Understanding this point, we can explain some life phenomena.

What is said here is all humble and not very high-minded. Let's just take two facts as examples. First, we often see advertisements for Mabaos in the newspaper. What exactly is going on? Originally, this was a very ancient belief, probably very popular in Persia and Arabia, and later spread to East Asia and Western Europe. At that time, emperors or powerful people were most afraid of being poisoned and assassinated, so they needed a personal self-defense treasure, and this was when Mabaos came into play. They placed the Mabaos at the bottom of the drinking vessel, or wrapped them with gold thread, and when eating, they used them to touch every food, and once touched, all poisons would be resolved, and so on. Regarding the treatment of diseases, Mabaos were ground into fine powder, taken internally and used externally, and all diseases could be cured, and so on. So what exactly are Mabaos? They are stones in the animal's body; in the stomach, or in the gallbladder, or in the bladder. Moreover, those who carry this treasure do not necessarily have to be horses. In terms of medicinal materials, some use sheep Mabaos, some use cow Mabaos, some use pig Mabaos, and some use camel Mabaos. The most expensive is sheep Mabaos (Persian sheep), while our country only calls them horse Mabaos. I think, humans are the spirit of all things, if human Mabaos were discovered, wouldn't that be great. However, in the hospitals of Meixian, Guangdong, human Mabaos are piled up like a small mountain, all sighing that their fate is thin, and they do not know where to belong—these are all human bladder stones.

Second, we often use "thousand-person needles" and other amulets as conversation aids, but we don't know that this is something that East Asia and Western Europe compete with each other in. The placenta of a pregnant woman is also a kind of thing entrusted with superstition; if it comes down with the fetus and has not yet ruptured, it is called a lucky placenta, which is even more extraordinary. The British are accustomed to sailing, but they are also afraid of drowning, so they use the lucky placenta as an amulet, saying that those who wear it will be spared the misfortune of drowning. When the lucky placenta comes into play, each one is worth twenty gold pounds. Later, navigation technology advanced rapidly, and the danger was greatly reduced, and the price of the lucky placenta also plummeted. However, twenty-three years ago (1916, during the World War), due to the occasional attacks by German submarines, the lucky placenta came into play again, and the price of each one rose to three gold pounds. Was British science still not developed at that time? No, this has nothing to do with scientific development, this is what is called "Ze Gui Mo".

People living on isolated islands may sneer, but hold on; look at how many Chinese houses still have Bagua diagrams hanging on the walls, how many cars still have small Fu gods hanging inside, and think about whether there are still friends who say, "A gentleman does not part with jade without reason" (it is said that wearing jade can prevent falls)? All these trivial matters, even Europe and the United States cannot completely avoid them today, this is an unavoidable "Ze Gui Mo".

### What Kind of Endocrine Agents Should Be Used to Treat Premature Ejaculation and Kidney Deficiency?

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Lao Da Medical School in Russia

The cause of kidney deficiency is due to the exhaustion of endocrine in the testicles. This is mostly due to excessive masturbation before marriage and indulging in promiscuity. Originally, sexual contact is due to the central nervous system of the brain first feeling the stimulus. Mental excitement occurs, which is transmitted to the erection center and ejaculation center in the spinal cord, causing them to be excited, and further causing the muscles and internal organs of the whole body to be excited. Therefore, the energy spent by a man in sexual intercourse is equivalent to eight hours of labor. If he indulges in promiscuity, of course, there will be disadvantages to his body. As for masturbation, it is even more harmful to the body than ordinary sexual intercourse, because masturbation only relies on one's own fantasy to arouse pornography, and it is easy to fall into excess. Therefore, as a result, it often leads to premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia.

Standing on the front line of clinical physicians, we have to trace the source of each patient's disease. At the same time, for the endless stream of new drugs that appear, we cannot just rely on the brief descriptions attached to each drug to determine its effectiveness. So as not to lose credibility with patients in clinical practice.

When it comes to drugs for treating this kind of disease, endocrine agents are naturally the most effective, but there are many kinds of endocrine agents. However, for the treatment of kidney deficiency, only the youth gland endocrine preparation "Male Tonic B-Ti-Kang" is the most effective. It is not only a supplement therapy for weakened reproductive function, but also can improve and harmonize the state of the whole body. Therefore, it can exert sufficient effectiveness for neurasthenia, incomplete development, premature aging, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea and other symptoms.

As for the clinical efficacy of the drug "B-Ti-Kang", doctors from various countries have detailed records. Since 1934, after Dr. France-den, a famous French doctor, conducted more than 30 chemical tests, he confirmed that the efficacy of this agent is the crown of all endocrine agents, and it has become popular all over the world. The successor was Dr. Stockholm, a famous Italian doctor, who chose the weakest newborn black bear and mixed "B-Ti-Kang" into the milk to feed it. After a week, it was more than twice as big as other black bears. He was very satisfied and believed that it was unmatched by various similar endocrine agents. His disciple Starling treated 3,000 critically ill kidney deficiency cases with this agent. Dr. Tolstoy, a famous American doctor, also said that this agent was the most perfect after nine years of experience. Its female version is a sacred medicine for regulating menstruation and seeds, and has a long-standing reputation in gynecology drugs.

### New Zealand Venereal Disease Hospital Announces Effective Treatment Results for Gonorrhea

— (Written by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine)

The New Zealand Venereal Disease Hospital must publish an annual analysis and accounting of various treatments for venereal diseases, such as electrotherapy, surgery, and oral medication. It is felt that the only effective medicine for gonorrhea is "Kreinon", invented by Dr. Peter of Germany. Dr. Hanwell, the director of gonorrhea at the hospital, made a precise statistic. In acute gonorrhea, taking three or four bottles of "Kreinon" can completely cure 97 out of 100 people. After more than 15 decisions of blood tests and the use of prostate massage, it has been proven to be completely cured.

Dr. Hanwell also used general chemical therapy and membrane penetration therapy for testing, and only three or four out of 100 people were cured, and there was still the disadvantage of recurrence. Therefore, the drug "Kreinon" has become a recognized effective medicine for gonorrhea by doctors all over the world.

Dr. Lewis of the United States also published the treatment results of the drug "Kreinon" in the hospital of Ben Snowveni, proving Dr. Hanwell's theory. Dr. La said, I have tried many drugs for treating gonorrhea, but the results are not as good as "Kreinon". The reason is that the theory on which this agent is based is the use of non-specific therapy, which is very different from general chemical therapy and membrane penetration sterilization therapy. For acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, I use "Kreinon" for treatment, and the cure rate is 96.8%. No current gonorrhea oral medication has such a noble treatment result. As for external medication, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Card-It-Snow-Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, washing themselves at home according to the diagrams and instructions, then the effect will be great. Since the invention of the drug "Kreinon", countless men and women suffering from gonorrhea have been completely freed from this suffering by the gift of this drug.

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Pulmonary disease is the most violent disease that deprives human life, and it is a great enemy of human prosperity. Therefore, people with pulmonary disease should be treated as soon as possible. Once the lungs lose their health, tuberculosis will become increasingly worse. At first, the spirit will be depressed, night sweats will decrease, and then chest pain and cough will occur. Finally, the face will be yellow and thin, sputum and blood will be coughed up, tinnitus, headache, insomnia, palpitations, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and difficulty sleeping. If only symptomatic treatment is used, although it can stop the superficial symptoms, the tuberculosis bacteria still exist, and even easier to breed, and more pathological changes will occur. Only the drug "Bufei Nal" has a truly different effect, because it can kill tuberculosis bacteria, shrink lesions, and even restore the corroded lung cavities to their original state. This is the most ideal pulmonary disease oral medication. As for the symptom of cough, taking this agent can relieve cough and expectorant within three hours, and it is effective in every test.

### Cured Examples of Spermatorrhea: Bedwetting in Childhood, Spermatorrhea in Adulthood

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

Patient Tang Youqian, 20 years old, (claimed) that he had been weak, thin and sick since he was a child, and often had bedwetting. Although he prepared carefully, it was ineffective. It was not until he was sixteen years old that bedwetting stopped, and spermatorrhea was discovered. At first, it was nocturnal emission, and then there was spermatorrhea without dreams, and the number gradually increased, and the spirit was depressed. (Cure process) Tang's disease was caused by congenital weakness, so he was ordered to take care of his health, often do outdoor exercise, and take "Naires Spermatorrhea Tablets" to strengthen the sperm barrier. Take "B-Ti-Kang" to supplement weakness. After three months, spermatorrhea has disappeared, and the body has become stronger day by day.

Patient Fan Hongda, 25 years old, (claimed) that when he was 16 years old, he was seduced by a cousin who was three years older than him, and committed the bad habit of masturbation. A year later, spermatorrhea occurred, but the number was very sparse. Unexpectedly, after marriage, he was impotent and unable, and sexual intercourse only lasted a few seconds. For the sake of posterity, he came to seek treatment (Cure process). He was ordered to take "Naires Spermatorrhea Tablets" to strengthen the sperm barrier, and was given "Sleeve-Ti-Kang" and electrotherapy every day, and he recovered in three months.

Trivial Words About Gonorrhea

### Why is it Easy to be Infertile When Suffering from Orchitis?

— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

Where do human beings come from? Evolutionists must say that human beings evolved from apes, but in fact, I say that the reason why our human beings continue to grow is entirely dependent on the unremitting work of the testicles to produce sperm. The responsibility of this organ is paramount. It is a regrettable thing that human beings are often invaded by diseases, so that the "birthplace of mankind" is ruined. The testicles are most easily broken by diseases, especially gonorrhea. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea should be quickly cured before the gonococcus invades the testicles, so as to avoid the consequences of prolonged and difficult healing.

But if a patient with gonorrhea is really invaded by gonococcus into the testicles one day, there is no need to be pessimistic. Because if the gonococcus has already invaded the testicles, it often invades the right testicle first, that is, it becomes epididymitis. At this time, because the gonococcus has just invaded, the tissues in the testicle have not been completely destroyed by the gonococcus. If treatment is rapid and legal, it is not difficult to cure. However, if it once causes a prairie fire, and the left and right testicles are completely affected by this poison, it will destroy the function of producing sperm, forming the danger of male infertility. I use German anti-gonorrhea serum and the effective medicine for gonorrhea "Kreinon" as oral medication, and also use static electricity therapy, so that the patient is absolutely quiet. So, the safe and thorough treatment is carried out, so that the patient is absolutely quiet. So, the safe and thorough treatment is carried out. In acute orchitis, the swelling can be reduced within two days and the root can be cured within a week. In chronic orchitis, it will not be cured without three or four weeks. According to the statistics on my diagnosis book for the past 20 years, all gonorrheal orchitis cured by me can restore reproductive function, have children, and have no bad prognosis. Therefore, it is a mistake for people with orchitis to fall into pessimism. Consultation hours are from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. From today, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation every day. Each number only costs 50 cents and comes with a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth one yuan.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Futures Soar, Cash Continues to Climb to High Peak, Once Seeing a New Price of 648 Yuan, Foreign Banks Take Advantage of the High Price to Come Out, and the Rise is Suddenly Frustrated

Yesterday's cash spot market conditions, the difference between the ups and downs was not as drastic as in the past few days, but the market trend was still mostly illusory, showing a trend of first soaring and then slightly falling. At first, it was because the aftershocks of the six consecutive days of rising had not subsided, and it was heard that foreign exchange futures suddenly tightened sharply, and people's hearts were even more firm. In addition, the spot chips have been emptied a lot after being vigorously collected by the Tianjin-Hong Kong and local gangs (stockbrokers who only buy and do not sell). The Japanese gang continued to entrust securities brokers and a certain money exchange to start purchasing again, and the Hong Kong gang also entered as soon as the price fell, so the market trend moved towards the peak, and once again created an unprecedented high price of 2,648 yuan. Later, a certain gold company (on behalf of speculators) and a certain bank (on behalf of foreign firms taking advantage of the high price to come out, the market trend suddenly reversed and fell, but the result still soared by 50 yuan.

Later, the Securities Brokers Suddenly Slowed Down the Rise with the Selling Wind, and the Securities Brokers Sold 50 Taels to the Gold Company, and the Price Fell Back to 615 Yuan. Around 11:30, Guest Gangs Came to Absorb and Purchase Again, and a Certain Gold Company Also Took the Opportunity to Leverage Strongly, Causing the Rising Wind to Rise Again, and Angered to 635 Yuan Again. Later, the Silver Brokers Spilled 50 Taels to the Money Exchange, and the Price Returned to 628 Yuan. The Power of the Money Exchange Mutually Did 50 Taels, and 630 Yuan Was the Noon Closing Price. In the Early Afternoon, the Market Trend Was Still Flat. First, a Certain Money Exchange Entered a Cash Gold Company at 50 Taels, and the Price Was the Same as the Noon Closing, Which Was 630 Yuan.

### Cotton Yarn: Gold Prices Rise Daily, Bulls are Enthusiastic About High Prices, 20-Count Double Horse Breaks Through 500 Yuan Mark

A certain cotton company has also come to search for and purchase goods. Although prices have entered high territory, buyers are still in a state of excitement. The peak price for 20-count Double Horse yarn reached 502 yuan, only 6 yuan short of last year's peak price. It is noted that the spot yarn price last Tuesday was 430 yuan. Since the foreign exchange rate contracted last Wednesday, it has jumped for five consecutive days, rising by a substantial 72 yuan, which is not insignificant. Therefore, actual demand remains slow and sluggish, but market prices have already shown inconsistencies, indicating that people are wavering and uncertain.

The highest price for warehouse receipts was 495 yuan. Another round of consolidation occurred midway.

In addition, the foreign exchange rate was fixed at 6.5 pence. The closing price for 20-count Double Horse spot was 495 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 487.5 yuan, similar to the closing price on the previous day. The situation at the opening in the afternoon was tight again, with gold prices said to be very high. A certain company came in to buy again, and sentiment suddenly became strong. 20-count Double Horse once reached 500 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 495 yuan. Before long, scattered bulls took profits and retreated, causing a setback. By the time of the closing price, 20-count Double Horse outside warehouse was priced at 498 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was called at 493 yuan.

### Disappointment with Export Subsidies, U.S. Cotton Suddenly Drops More Than Ten Points, Foreign Cotton Transactions Only Involve Resales to Japanese Factories, Brazilian Cotton Reaches Unprecedented Price of 120 Yuan

In the foreign cotton market, New York opened higher due to favorable reports from Liverpool and Bombay, and cotton fabric transactions were more active, causing cotton prices to rise slightly by two or three points. Later, due to the agricultural meeting held in Washington yesterday to discuss the issue of cotton export subsidies, it was found that according to the budget for the cotton industry, there was a shortage of 338,000,000 yuan, so the export subsidy was stopped and stagnated. A certain congressman stated that the focus of future discussions would be slightly changed, with the intention of setting a certain price for U.S. cotton consumed domestically, so that the cotton prices of other countries could be sought based on this price. Yesterday, various traders expressed disappointment with the export subsidy, and the South sold heavily on the market, causing the closing price to fall by more than ten points. India, including forecasts, rose by one rupee, and Egypt rose by more than ten points.

The local cotton trade remains sluggish, and prices are firm and rising, continuing to advance, as inventory is becoming increasingly short and the exchange rate has increased after the exchange rate adjustment, making people more bullish. As for foreign cotton trading among fellow traders, it is still frequent, and market prices are rising. The supply from northern Jiangsu is becoming scarce again, with only 164 bales of Tongzhou cotton arriving. 75 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong for export. The current spot cotton situation is recorded below.

Bleached and dyed cloth also increased in price by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. EWO bleached cloth rose from 16.5 yuan to 17 yuan. Hongzhang's Three Sheep striped pongee cloth opened this week at 0.56 yuan per yard, a huge increase of 0.05 yuan per yard compared to the previous Monday. Lunchang's new dark-colored crepe de chine opened at 13 yuan per piece, with the busiest trading among fellow traders on this street and speculators. In total, over a thousand pieces of coarse cloth, over two hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were traded. Dyeing factories continued to purchase three hundred pieces of fine twill as dyeing blanks. Customer routes were smoother in eastern Zhejiang, with over two hundred pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill purchased, and over a hundred boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, pongee, broadcloth, velvet, and corduroy. Over two thousand pieces of colored cloth were purchased in Taizhou and Xinghua in northern Jiangsu, and over a hundred boxes of colored cloth and colored twill were purchased by Cantonese traders. Over three thousand pieces of colored cloth and floral cloth were purchased overseas in Little Luzon, Siam, and Singapore.

Eastern Cloth

White goods, due to the eagerness of traders both inside and outside the industry to hoard them, were repeatedly raised in price. The market for fine cloth and fine twill has been soaring. This morning, the peak price for next month's futures of Dragon Head fine cloth reached 15.25 yuan, then retreated due to sales from Tianjin traders, but the market rebounded due to a shortage of chips. As a result, the spot price of Dragon Head was 14.9 yuan, 15 yuan for this month, and 15.1 yuan for next month. Other brands such as Yanghe, Wufu, and Trumpet were consistently raised in price due to absorption by fellow traders, increasing by 0.4 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. A total of about two thousand pieces were traded. On the foreign company side, only Eastern Cotton opened sales of 200 bales of Qingdao-made Happy Crane brand fine cloth at 12 pounds.

Exports

On the 14th, 25 pieces of textiles were shipped to Beihai, 80 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 150 pieces to Hong Kong, 9 pieces to Xiamen, and 505 pieces to Shantou. Also, on the 13th, 92 pieces arrived from Yantai.

### Grains: Mildew Season, Little Rain, Rice Prices Rise Again, Combined Old Measure Nears 22 Yuan, Nanjing Indica Above 16 Yuan

Du Geng: Yesterday, the total arrival of various groups from the river reached 2,450 white packages of Songjiang Gang No. 4 and Che Lun Baozi, along with Su Kun. The time is approaching the mildew season for rice planting, but unfortunately, there is a drought and lack of rain, causing farmers to have difficulty planting rice. People are therefore taking precautions. The sales market on this street is exceptionally active, and both speculators and traders are showing caution, and the market seems to have difficulty meeting demand, so the market is rising rapidly. Special Chang Geng has even reached 19 yuan, and other thinner and thicker Geng are also around 18 yuan, an increase of more than 0.5 yuan compared to before. Looking back at the recent rice market, it has been rising all the way, and compared to last week, the price of Geng rice has risen by about 1.5 yuan, which, converted to the old measure, is 21.67 yuan.

The price of Wuhu-produced indica rice for passenger use has been gradually rising. Yesterday's telegram indicated an increase of one yuan in two days, reaching over sixteen yuan in Shanghai. Traders took the opportunity to sell off, and the morning market once soared by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. The price of intermediate goods was already around 15 yuan. Later, because the price was high, speculators started to release goods, but the result was still more than 0.5 yuan higher. 6 to 7 thousand packages were traded. Nanjing indica has already been quoted at over 16 yuan, but most of the arrivals yesterday were still speculators. As for the price of Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian, they also followed up by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan.

Various Factories Restrict Supply, Flour Market Exceptionally Strong

Kunshan New Wheat Continues to Arrive in Shanghai

Flour

The current market for flour from local factories is exceptionally strong, driven by the black market foreign exchange rate. The cost of imported flour has increased, with a difference of more than 0.5 yuan per bag compared to before. Moreover, the raw materials for factory flour are also imported wheat, so although factory prices have already increased by 0.3 yuan, they are planning to continue to increase. Furthermore, with customer sales increasing, various factories are taking this opportunity to restrict supply. It has been reported that both the north and south groups have stopped operations for many days. After a brief period of smooth operations the day before, importers must also have very strong demand, so the number of transactions has been reduced by half compared to before. As for retail transactions on this street and among individual households, there are still more than 10,000 bags. The price of No. 2 flour opened at 4.75 yuan, an increase of 0.05 yuan compared to before. It is reported that imported flour is quoted at over 5 yuan, but the actual selling price is 4.7 yuan in cash, which, combined with the exchange rate, is also over 4.9 yuan. Therefore, the market environment is constantly rising. Today, 19,800 bags of flour will be shipped to Shantou, and 1,000 bags of wheat bran will also be shipped to Shantou.

Wheat

Yesterday, the source of new wheat continued with a few batches arriving in Shanghai but not yet officially on the market. Upon investigation, the Nanjing wheat that recently arrived, because the Chinese factories have not yet started operations, the Japanese merchants and passenger traders have also stalled. With the flour price rising day by day, those holding goods are planning to sell at good prices, and most are waiting to sell on the warehouse, so the market supply is particularly sparse. However, it is heard that 60 bags of Kunshan new wheat continued to arrive, with better quality than the first batch, and were purchased by the street at a price of 6.08 yuan, an increase of over 0.4 yuan compared to the previous settlement.

### Silk and Tea: Factory Sales Open at 2,150 Yuan, First High Price After Foreign Exchange Changes, Tussah Silk Sells Well in India and the Philippines

Yesterday's silk market: The trend in Japan and the United States was still weak, with New York futures down 0.08 points for both near and deferred months. The spot price of Japanese silk fell by 0.06 to 0.07 points, Shanghai silk fell by 0.03 points, Guangdong silk fell by 0.01 points, and Yokohama spot price fell by another 20 yuan, a decrease of more than 140 yuan compared to two weeks ago. One reason for this is that the cocoon collection in the East Market has not yet been completed, and silk prices are still being suppressed. On the other hand, the main factor is that autumn textiles in the United States are more focused on rayon.

The local silk market still has no clear performance. This is because the transportation of cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is still in dispute. The foreign company silk market had a grade of 7-8 white and the factory opened at 2,150 yuan, the first high price settlement after the exchange rate change, but transactions in England, France, and America were not stimulated by this, and buying interest did not increase. On the contrary, transactions in India and Africa suddenly became very active yesterday. Meida, Samsung, Xiangli and other companies opened sales of 80 loads of Tussah silk, including Qianjin wood town silk. In addition, 25 loads of Dou Gong silk were also traded, and silk prices are rising sharply. In the green tea market, the total transaction volume of Chun Mee, Needle Mee, etc., reached more than 580 boxes. The top price for hand-picked tea opened at 275 yuan, and the price for ordinary Chun Mee opened at 220 yuan. The market continues to rise by 7 or 8 yuan. Today, five pieces of tea will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Fellow Townsman

— Geng Zhi

A certain organization where people of a certain surname swarm like bees and ants can be called a "certain surname ancestral hall." Similarly, a certain organization where people from a certain place gather like maggots and flies can also be called "the hometown association of that place" or "a certain place guild."

The formation of these "hometown associations" or "guilds" is, of course, due to those in power not forgetting their old friends and pulling them in. Examples from the past include arranging butchers and wine sellers from Fengpei in the Sishui Pavilion, and more recently, arranging barbers and foot masseuses from Yexian by the Dog Meat General. Thus, in this "association," if you are not related to royalty, you must be a prince or minister wearing a yellow jacket. Then they call friends and acquaintances to join, forming a pure and magnificent spectacle. When Liu An attained enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascended to heaven. If you are not a chicken or dog, don't even think about getting in. If you, in your dignified seven-foot frame, want to replace a chicken or a dog, you can't even move, and you're likely to be pecked or bitten. Liu An belongs to them, what does it have to do with you!

The bond of people with the same surname is the backbone of a patriarchal society. Similarly, the mutual assistance of people from the same hometown is a vestige of the feudal system. I can't bear to say that the patriarchal society is wrong, and similarly, how dare I say that the feudal system is bad? Moreover, erudite scholars often cite ancient examples to prove the inevitability and necessity of the feudal system and the existence of hometown relations. They say:

When Chinese people go abroad, Chinese people abroad are all fellow countrymen. In the future, when people on Earth go to Mars or any planet, people on Earth on other planets will all be fellow countrymen. When people in the solar system go to other star systems, people in the solar system in other star systems will all be fellow countrymen. When people in this universe go to another universe, people in this universe in another universe will all be fellow countrymen... Then, to shrink it down and tighten it up, considering an organization, recognizing fellow countrymen makes people feel closer, and determining that those who are not of my race are of a different mind is not surprising.

Sometimes I want to spoil the fun and say, since everyone in the same universe is a fellow countryman, or to put it more simply, since all Chinese people are fellow countrymen, isn't it good to have such a big hometown? Why must we have the small hometowns that make a ritual in the snail shell? The scholars say, this is called division of labor and cooperation, and gathering strength from all quarters. With small hometowns, it's naturally easier to form a large hometown. Everyone organizes small hometowns and excludes non-hometown people: the way of the ancient kings, this is beautiful! When they bring up the ancient kings, I can only keep quiet, because I am still a modern person and don't understand the ancient kings.

However, the human heart is made of flesh after all, and thinking about the benefits of hometown associations, they really cannot be buried. For example, hometown associations have mortuaries, so that you won't have nowhere to be buried when you die. Hometown associations transport coffins, so that you can be buried in your hometown when you die, and your soul can return to your homeland... Chinese people, who have always valued post-mortem glory, still need to rely on hometown associations to be able to rest in peace. So, how do we know that a "hometown association" in miniature, a certain organization, will not only accommodate the living but also accommodate the dead? We should especially praise its boundless merits in this regard.

Because hometowns have so many benefits, everyone likes to recognize fellow townsmen. If there is a big shot or any famous person in their hometown, it is of course their glory and they will definitely boast about it to everyone. Within a country, the same province is the same hometown, and even in more distant places, neighboring provinces are also the same hometown. Within a province, the same prefecture or the same circuit or the same special region is the same hometown. The starting point of a hometown is originally the county, but when necessary, it is expanded to encompass a wider area. Even if there is only the name of a hometown without the reality, people still keep talking about hometown, because the term hometown is really too mesmerizing.

"Su Xiao of Qiantang is a kinswoman from my hometown," and "kinswoman" is also the same as fellow townsman. "Hou Shi-weng" is so complacent about it. "Old fellow countrymen" performed on stage in Tianjin and won much welcome. "Stopping the boat to ask temporarily, perhaps they are fellow countrymen." The delicate voice suggests what kind of person she is....

But if you want to recognize him as a fellow townsman, he refuses to recognize you as a fellow townsman, this also happens a lot. The reason is that you are obviously a bungler, and he is obviously successful. You will harm him, so he will of course not recognize you. Gongsun Hong of the Han Dynasty lamented, "I'd rather meet a bad guest than an old friend," and this is the reason. And there are also those who betray fellow townsmen to gain merit. It is said that in the past, the censors impeached their relatives, old friends, and fellow townsmen, because only the misdeeds of fellow townsmen could they know in detail, so they could avoid errors based on hearsay....

Writing this, it makes people shiver about fellow townsmen again. What should we do?

### PhD: "Old fogey, eat a big pancake!"

### In the Mountain Hollow

— Li Qiao

——Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou

After passing that wheat field, ahead were two bare stone mountains flanking a narrow pass. Beside the pass stood a tall mountain covered in green grass—it was so majestic and perilous that, if the enemy had even a single machine gun positioned there, we wouldn't have dreamed of getting through the valley. But they were positioned on the mountain peaks in front of the highway, thinking we would certainly follow that road. They didn't expect us to detour this way, around the side of the mountain.

Just as we were walking through the narrow pass, suddenly a plane came chasing from behind. Although everyone was a little anxious and wanted to scatter quickly, in this rugged valley with no cover, it was impossible to spread out. Helpless, we could only be bold and continue dispersing as if nothing was happening.

After passing through the pass, we sat down by the foot of a mountain, waiting for Commander Zhang who was behind us. We saw the continuous stream of troops emerging from the pass like a flood, blurring our vision. Suddenly, three heavy bombers flew over with a terrifying, deep rumble. The troops quickly scattered and lay down beside the road and in the wheat fields. However, some of the troops had nowhere to hide and could only squat on the road, letting the horses graze on the green grass by the roadside.

The three heavy bombers, gleaming with the light of the setting sun, leisurely circled in the sky. They flew to the airspace above the pass, and suddenly one of them descended:

Boom! Boom!

A burst of fire erupted, followed by a thin wisp of black smoke that rose into the sky and slowly dissipated.

The mountains and fields were exceptionally quiet, with only a monotonous humming sound echoing.

After circling once, the three heavy bombers flew to the front, not far away, and a long series of explosions rang out like thunder:

——Boom! Boom! Boom!……

One plane flew back, suddenly descending, half-tilting its wings, and strafing the wheat field:

——Da da da da da……

Along with the brothers of the Special Service Company, we lay neatly at the foot of the mountain, watching those three planes with pride and shame, madly circling in the sky, our hearts filled with extreme anger!

The sun had set, and the sky was overcast. As the night crept into the distance of the fields, appearing somewhat hazy, the three planes finally flew away.

The brothers who had rested beside the road and in the wheat fields got up, smiles on their faces:

"Damn it, they come bombing every day, but they never manage to kill me!"

"These big liars, after bombing us today, I wonder how they'll be telling their people: 'We killed so many of them today!'"

"Their people are so pitiful! Their hard-earned money is just used by their warlords to buy bombs and drop them on our land, and they still suffer from their deceitful propaganda. It's truly unjust!"

Treading on the vast twilight, the column set off again along an uneven dirt road.

### Germ and Anesthetic Warfare (Part 2)

— By J.M. Murray, translated by Tian Ren

"When the war breaks out, millions of soldiers gather at the front. Suddenly, enemy artillery fire fiercely bombards them. The shells that land among them are a bit different, all exploding into fine dust. Showers of 'shell dust' fall on the soldiers, and immediately thousands upon thousands collapse to the ground, losing consciousness. In an instant, millions of troops are anesthetized and fall to the ground. Then, the artillery fire ceases, followed by a large number of enemies pouring in like a tide. The millions of unconscious people are disarmed and completely surrounded by the enemy, with many machine guns set up at key locations. Soon, they gradually awaken. As they regain consciousness, loudspeakers set up in all directions tell them that if they do not surrender, they will be annihilated. Naturally, they feel that sacrifice is futile and surrender unconditionally. The war thus comes to an end."

(IV) George Bernard Shaw Prefers Anesthetic or Gas Warfare

The great British writer George Bernard Shaw, in his recent commentary on war weapons, declared that he would rather be anesthetized and lose consciousness, or even suffocate from poison gas, than be blown to pieces by sixteen-inch guns.

On November 4, 1937, three New York chemists reported to the American Chemical Society on how millions of people could be anesthetized in a decisive war. They said that the anesthetic that could be loaded into shells is a type of acetyl chloride, mixed with an irritant that can erode the skin, so the anesthetic can penetrate blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and cause loss of consciousness. Changing the ratio of drugs can make the effective time last from several minutes to several hours.

Many people will think that using anesthetics in a decisive war does not feel terrifying, but in addition, there are many disgusting anesthetics, and war leaders may have bestial outbreaks and use them to poison the enemy.

(V) Soviet Russia Races to Produce Wartime Anesthetics

Soviet leaders have publicly declared that if they are forced to fight, they will annihilate the enemy in the shortest possible time. Experts from the former German Republic have established great chemical factories throughout Russia. Russian political leaders also never hide that their chemical factories are manufacturing anesthetics and poison gas for war day and night, in order to quickly eliminate enemies who attack them. German chemical factories are also working hard to manufacture anesthetics and poison gas for the next war. British chemists warned the world a year ago that they might be forced to resort to using poison to fight poison in the next decisive war.

The resistance behavior of prisoners and frequent attempts to escape are annoying. During the World War, it was suggested to force prisoners to smoke opium in order to save trouble, but fortunately it was not actually adopted. But in the next decisive war, it may be adopted. Or even a ruthless country will give their prisoners a "hypnotic pill." Due to the effects of a malignant anesthetic, prisoners may become addicted to killing, while at the same time being mentally confused, unable to distinguish between friend and foe, and be sent back to their own country to kill their comrades.

(VI) Humane Warfare (?)

Scientific experts want to use anesthetic poison gas as war weapons to absolve themselves of the responsibility for manufacturing killing weapons, and therefore write articles arguing that using anesthetic poison gas as a weapon is more humane than blasting human bodies to pieces with artillery fire. They say that if the ultimate goal is to make the enemy surrender, then the more humane method of making the enemy lose consciousness with anesthetics can be used. They point out that there are at least a dozen anesthetics that can make people emotionally indifferent, unwilling to do anything, and hate anything, the only hope is "peace".

Just imagine, if the people of an entire country are anesthetized during wartime, then important industries will stop, and even a small part cannot be made in munitions factories, and naturally they will be defeated.

Several well-known experts have declared that it is easy to put anesthetics in the drinking water sources of enemy countries in wartime. It is more difficult to put anesthetics in food, but water sources are very easy to put anesthetics in.

This method of anesthetizing the enemy, even if used on a large scale, is not easy to detect. Because there are no obvious signs, no poisoning, no death, just an increase in national indifference. People will not care about who wins or loses the war, they just hope for peace quickly, no matter what the conditions.

Now it seems like a dream to say that anesthetics will be the decisive factor in world wars, but we must remember that modern war weapons such as airplanes, submarines, and tanks were also thought to be people's dreams before! (Translated from World Magazine)

### A Truth

— Shi De

If there were no truth in the world, I would add this one for it; if there were already many truths, I would only believe this one: "Willpower is the first life of mankind."

If I hadn't established this belief in my heart early on, I might have committed suicide because of that setback two years ago; if it weren't for the encouragement of this sentence, I would have wondered in surprise: Why haven't I shed a single tear for a disappointing event in recent years?

Currently, countless people have ruined their families, but they don't complain to anyone. They feel that in order to cope with difficult times, a persevering fighting spirit is more valuable than gaining the sympathy of others.

Friends! If you believe this is a truth, you should always believe it. If you don't know it yet, then please think it over carefully. (Charity Auction Donation)

Spring and Autumn

### Talking About "Farmer's Song"

— Si Hua

Produced by the Soviet Ukrainian Film Factory, screening day and night at the Shanghai Guangda Theater today.

Early on, when reading about the collective farm peasants of the Bizina and October Revolution communes in "Soviet Anecdotes," and how they lived, cultivated, raised livestock, produced, and consumed together, I felt very surprised and envious. But this is not a fabricated myth, but an ironclad fact. The Soviet collective farms described in the book vividly appear before our eyes in "Farmer's Song." When we see the abundant agricultural products and mechanized harvesting on the screen, the envy in our hearts surges again. Soviet collective farms are progressing rapidly. The October Revolution commune in 1930 had just bought a tractor and started applying chemical fertilizers, while the collective farms in "Farmer's Song" not only have many tractors, but also have a good harvest.

Although the theme of "Farmer's Song" is to encourage production, it has a very good impact on China in the War of Resistance.

First: China's War of Resistance is a long-term one. In addition to military and political aspects, actively launching production work in the rear is a major condition for supporting the long-term War of Resistance. The majority of China's production is agriculture. How to improve agriculture has become a very urgent issue to study. Naturally, it is still impossible for China to establish collective farms immediately, but it is possible to partially adopt the advantages of collective farms according to China's situation. At least, the establishment of a collective farm system is of great help to national defense, because the farmers of collective farms are already organized, have received political training, understand the power of unity, and those tractors can also be converted into weapons at any time. It not only enriches the resources of the War of Resistance, but also makes invaders feel like they are trapped when they invade collective farms. Some people may worry that it is not easy to realize, but weren't the Kutzina farm and October Revolution commune of the Soviet Union also grown up in difficulties and hardships?

Second: It tells us that love and work are not opposing. The Soviet Union does not only value work and have no love; however, it tells us that we must talk about love without hindering work. The farmers in "Farmer's Song" who were madly in love were finally persuaded by the correct theory of the work team leader. I think this can play a little educational role on the isolated island, because even though the isolated island is far from the fire, many people are indulged in erotic pleasure, even abandoning their own work and putting themselves in death. "Farmer's Song" corrects this kind of mistake. Regarding this point, I especially admire the strong agitation method of the screenwriter Bomiskikov. The love disputes he depicts are not like Hollywood screenwriters who create a "sexy and funny" story; on the contrary, he incites both sides to step up their work from the love disputes.

The high skill of Bomiskikov's artistic skills can be seen from the fact that this simple story is depicted so vividly. There is preaching in it, but we can't see the shadow of his preaching. He used some comedy techniques, exaggerating the watchman and the accountant a little. The Soviet comedy technique is a bit different from Hollywood's. It does not forget reality and realism in exaggeration.

Some people say that Soviet films are almost all rough and careless, but the director of "Farmer's Song" seems very delicate, such as:

(1) The accountant is sorting out documents, the documents are suddenly blown away by the wind, the camera focuses on the door, and Marinka is pushed in to fight.

(2) Using very flexible lenses to describe couples in the forest, two points are more worth noting: (A) The lens shakes down from the couple on the bridge, the lens sweeps across the river surface, shakes up, and another couple is singing under the trees by the river. (B) Using past sounds and space, singing echoes in the empty forest, and the lens moves arbitrarily in the space.

(3) In the end, Marinka and Skola have a quarrel, and everyone sings in their own home. The director uses sound splicing, which is very clever.

The most powerful scene is after Skola said bad things about Marinka, the women's team stepped up their work. At this time, the director used high-speed lens changes to write about them shouting, singing, and stacking crops. The editing here is particularly agile. Yes, the time and space on the sound surface before and after the big storm are not consistent enough. To put it clearly, the close-up and full-view shots cannot be fully coordinated, such as:

(1) Close-up: The clouds in the sky gradually darken; the wind blows the grass in front of the camera; the stacked crops are blown down; the women grab and stack...

(2) Long shot: The sky is very bright, it doesn't look like a rainy day, only water is sprinkled down in front of the camera as rain, but this rain cannot be coordinated with the space.

This is naturally a minor matter. And it's mostly an artistic issue. The director's treatment of the whole is always completed in a majestic and lively atmosphere.

I quite like Lyubesh Guiyev, who played the accountant. It is said that this was his first time making a film, but his acting skills can make this character typical. His actions are exaggerated, quite clownish, but he can understand this character very well. Distorting a little, the character will become a bad guy who destroys the collective farm. In fact, he is just selfish and provokes other people's feelings. The best parts of his play are: (1) Pulling Skola in for a haircut. (2) When Makalin is next to the team leader, investigating the accountant's report card, he deliberately eavesdrops on the side, showing an awkward look. (3) His embarrassment when he was chased by the watchman, and his joy when he won the award.

The watchman in Tollih performs quite honestly and cutely. His expression when he drives the couples home in the forest is very interesting. Although the chase after the accountant has a bit of comedy, it also reveals a pure sense of justice.

Beszgen's tractor driver can express the robustness and hard work of Soviet youth very well.

Radnina's Macalin is very lively, and her crying when she is scolded is quite sincere.

Other actors are also very successful.

As for music and singing, I can only say that I love it very much.

### Pay Attention to Medicinal Water Stamps

— Yun

"Where have the copper coins gone?"

On the tram, in the vegetable market, on the streets, throughout Shanghai, almost everyone can hear such questions. In fact, those who ask these questions, how can they not know where the copper coins have gone, so are they pretending to be stupid? Absolutely not! Because in order to take the tram, buy things, because of the lack of copper coins, all kinds of troubles have occurred, but there is no way to sanction those unscrupulous profiteers, "Where have the copper coins gone?" There is unlimited anger contained in this question.

That's right, because of the change, there was confusion in the market, and some stores even sacrificed their business. But what about daily necessities? For example, soy sauce shops, tobacco shops, these shops have a close relationship with the residents, and this close relationship is all change transactions, so everyone came up with a convenient way: some issued their own numbered vouchers, and some used stamps as change.

Although it is clear that this method is also very inconvenient, the vouchers issued by this store are only valid for this store, the stamps are easily soiled, and after the glue on the back melts, they are easy to stick to other things, and when they are transferred to each other, they will immediately turn into a piece of waste paper. However, after the stamps are generally used, they are indeed more convenient than vouchers. In order to avoid losses, they are all wrapped in transparent paper, and everyone is circulating them like auxiliary currency notes.

But even this little convenience aroused the attention of some "unscrupulous people." In the past two days, many used stamps have been found on the market. They washed the old stamps in a kind of medicinal water, the seal on the surface is more blurred, and then wrapped them in transparent paper, it is simply impossible to distinguish the true from the false. Moreover, the people who transfer them to each other are used as a substitute for auxiliary currency, and no one pays attention to the nature of the stamps, but when they really want to use them for sending letters, they find that the medicine-washed stamps are wrapped inside.

Although this is a small scam, they are taking this opportunity to "fish in troubled waters", and their harm will not be lighter than the profiteers who buy copper coins.

I hope everyone pays attention to this group of unscrupulous people who disrupt the market!

### Talking About Collecting Old Stamps

— Sha Lumin

Some people like to collect old copper coins, all kinds of old, ancient, strange, and foreign copper coins are collected like treasures. Although it seems a bit eccentric to others; in fact, this is also a kind of "hobby", which is much better than wasteful ways of entertainment.

In addition, collecting ancient books, ancient bottles, ancient utensils... are not considered bad habits.

Now let's talk about the interesting things about collecting old stamps: Not to mention foreign stamps, it is also very difficult to collect Chinese stamps completely, and you must pay attention to them anytime, anywhere. For example, there are several kinds of stamps in the previous Qing Dynasty. The date on the postmark is also very interesting, and it is calculated according to the lunar calendar. Remote provinces also add the words "limited to be affixed in a certain province", which is very difficult to collect. It is okay to collect closer ones such as Sichuan and Yunnan, but it is too difficult to collect more distant ones such as Xinjiang. There are also temporary commemorative stamps issued such as "National Government Unification Commemorative Stamps", "Sun Yat-sen's State Funeral Commemorative Stamps" and "President Tan Yankai Commemorative Stamps". Those who collect them should pay attention, otherwise they are very easy to collect, because the issuance amount of this kind of temporary commemorative stamp is very small, and they are often bought out by people who are quick to seize the opportunity.

There is a kind of Qing Dynasty stamps with the four red characters "Republic of China" printed on them. This kind is also valuable. The "New Life Movement Commemorative Stamps" and "The 40th Anniversary Commemorative Stamps of the Opening of the Chinese Post Office" are not only different in shape and color, but this difference represents the changes of the times. In addition, it seems easy to collect stamps commemorating revolutionary martyrs Huang Xing, Chen Yingshi, and Song Jiaoren, but it is difficult to collect a complete set.

There are several kinds of stamps that are abolished and no longer used, but before they are abolished, the post office always issues announcements. Now I will copy down the types of circulating stamps below: Ordinary stamps - those printed with President Sun Yat-sen's portrait include 2 cents, 5 cents, 15 cents, 25 cents, 1 yuan, 2 yuan, 5 yuan. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Deng Xianlie include half a cent and one and a half cents. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Chen Yingshi include 1 cent and 5 jiao. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Liao Zhongkai include 3 cents and 3 jiao. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Zhu Zhixin include 8 cents, 13 cents. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Song Jiaoren include 1 jiao and 17 fen. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Huang Keqiang include 2 jiao and 4 jiao. As for airmail stamps, there are eight kinds including 15 cents, 25 cents, 3 jiao, 45 cents, 5 jiao, 6 jiao, 9 jiao, and 1 yuan, all printed with airplanes and the Great Wall.

The above stamps are just the currently circulating ones, and it can be seen that the number is large, so it is really not easy to collect Chinese stamps completely, not to mention the past abolished stamps.

The United States also issues a lot of stamps, and the colors are the most beautiful, clear, and very pleasing to the eye. Printed with images of Lincoln, Hoover, Washington, Roosevelt, etc. German stamps are printed very exquisitely and can reflect light. And most British stamps are the same, with a portrait of an emperor. Cuban and Mexican stamps are also beautiful and are portraits. As for the patterns of Czechoslovakian stamps, they are also very delicate, while Danish stamps and Italian stamps are unique.

In short, stamp collecting is also a specialized art, and it is also a kind of "hobby": the key is to pay attention to all kinds of old stamps anytime and anywhere and pay attention to the issuance of new stamps in the post office.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 12 Red Powder Eliminates Hatred but Fails to Eliminate Karma, Green Window Talks About Love and Re-establishes a Good Relationship

At that time, Pan Peimei really had unspeakable grief, but she was not the kind of woman who would commit suicide, all women who get it do not. She only wanted to avenge Zhao Letian, and she would not lose her ambition to marry someone else. She couldn't agree to whatever her father wanted her to do. Who knew that after Zhao Qitian was injured and entered the hospital, in less than two years, Pan Peiying's father was assassinated and died. It turned out that at that time, Pan Peiying's father gradually became rich. He married a famous Shanghai dancer named Ling Xiaohua as his concubine. Unexpectedly, although this Ling Xiaohua was a dancer, she was a patriot. She was originally a young lady from a small family, and she could barely make ends meet. During the war, her hometown was occupied. Her mother and her sister were both raped, she was still young at that time, and fortunately escaped in the grave nest, and was not captured by the devil's hand. When she gradually grew older, this shame and grievance always gnawed at her heart, and she never forgot it. Because all the fields and houses were gone, she moved around and later became a dancer. But although she had ice and frost in her heart, she had a face like peaches and plums, so in less than a few months, she became very popular and very popular. At that time, there was a patriot who organized a secret society called something group. The characters in that group included men and women. Men were workers, hawkers, noble clerks, and humble servants. Women were prostitutes, dancers, young ladies, and factory girls. However, these characters were all young people, and there were no older people. Ling Xiaohua was also one of them, because her mother and sister were both raped and died, and she wanted revenge. One day, a dance guest took her to see a play. That day's play was exactly The Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty. When

### The Revival of Fudan's Drama Movement

— Jingran

— Joint Performance by Two Groups to Raise Relief Funds

In the past, under the leadership of Professor Hong Shen, the "Fudan Drama Society" undeniably occupied an important position in the art scene of Shanghai—and even arguably the entire China—shining brightly and praised by all. Later, Hong left Fudan and went south to Guangdong, and the "Fudan Drama Society" ceased operation due to the lack of a leader!

Recently, the "Haiyan Literary Society" and the "Female Students' Association," two groups organized by some students of Fudan University, wanted to revive the declining Fudan drama movement. After more than three months of preparation, they were able to hold a small-scale joint performance at the Ningbo Native Place Association at 7:30 PM on Monday the 12th to raise funds for disaster relief. This is the first sound of the revival of Fudan's drama movement!

This time, a total of three one-act plays were staged:

(1) On the Upper Floor—This is a realistic comedy that addresses Shanghai's extremely serious housing problem. However, it seemed to be underplayed in the performance. The sins of the second landlord exploiting the third tenant were not fully exposed, giving the audience the feeling that the second landlord's wife was not so ruthless. In addition, the landlady's long "complaint" about rent increases made the audience feel that it was "understandable." Compared with reality, it cannot be denied that the whole play was loose and a failure.

(2) Annoying Things—This describes the ugliness of a pretentious woman and a cowardly man, revealing the ugliness of the upper class. In terms of performance: the dialogue of Mrs. Li Sheng, the female clerk, was not loud enough, giving the audience in the back rows the feeling of "watching a silent pantomime." The male lead, who was full of Ah Q characteristics, worked very hard, but was somewhat over the top.

(3) Dancer's Tears—This scene was arguably the most exciting and the most able to attract the audience. The story tells of a dancer, Manli, who is seduced by a dance patron, Xiao Chen, and loses her virginity. In order to preserve Xiao Chen's reputation, she has an abortion and becomes ill. She still dreams that Xiao Chen will marry her, but the response she gets is: "The young master has plenty of money. What does it matter if he spends some? There's no shortage of women to play with!" The merciless blow drives her mad. This scene was undoubtedly a success due to the proper handling of the director and the efforts of the actors, which made the plot more tense and tightly gripped the hearts of the audience! There is something to be happy about here!

This time, the joint performance of the two groups was inevitably simple in terms of scenery and props due to the stage limitations. And because the actors lacked experience, both the movements and dialogue were inevitably a bit too much like "acting." However, actors such as Bai Sha, Lu Lu, Vera, Gan Cao, and Mei Bo are all promising dramatic talents. (Charity Sale Donation)

### Record of Listening to Opera at the Golden Theater

— Barking Sound

The Fuyuncheng Opera Troupe came to Shanghai for a large-scale performance for the second time. The author went to the Golden Theater on Sunday evening. When I took my seat, Yan Shishan's "Presenting Gold to the Emperor" was already coming to an end, followed by the full version of "Stealing the Imperial Horse." This play has been rarely performed in southern Yunnan in recent years, because there is no good martial clown. That night, Sheng Rong played Yang Dun, with both voice and appearance, from beginning to end, without the slightest carelessness, winning extremely good reviews from the audience. In the midst of the decline of the Jing role, he is truly a rare and valuable first-class talent. Gao Shenglin played Huang Tianba, with quite a bit of Xiaolou's style. Singing, recitation, and acting all imitated the Yang style, which is very gratifying. Ai Shiju's Zhu Guangzu was fluent in recitation and skilled in martial arts, especially adding color to the play. After the intermission, there was the full version of "Wulongyuan." Mao Shilai's Yan Xijiao appeared on stage in colorful attire, quite adhering to the typical Hua Dan style. Guan Shengxi's Song Jiang was also able to fulfill his role. In the Pingban segment where he suspects Yan Xijiao's thoughts, the Qin player mistakenly played the Up-phrase interlude instead of the Down-phrase interlude for the last sentence of the third phrase. Guan looked back at the stage at that time, but it had already been pulled out and could not be changed. Fortunately, Guan was quite calm and sang the sentence "Could it be that my mother beat and scolded you?" still singing it with the Down-phrase. This was not easy. However, when Shilai entered the door, he did not close the door, which seemed to be a small flaw. Because when he later pushed Song Jiang out the door, there was a movement of pulling the bolt to open the door. If he had to pull the bolt to open the door at this time, then he should have closed the door earlier. If he did not close the door earlier, then there was no need to pull the bolt to open the door at this time. This is a common problem for most actors performing this play, and it is not only Mao that is like this. Sha Shixin's Liu Tang started from writing the letter and continuously performed "Sitting in the Tower and Killing the Daughter-in-law," with the fire rising and shaking, with nothing to commend. Hanging the sign above Shenglin and Shengrong made Qiu and the two actors feel uneasy. After the capture, Shilai's circles under the lights were quite reasonable, but it was already 11:30, so he did not have time to go on stage and returned. (Charity Sale Donation)

### Talking about Chaozhou Opera

— Xiao Kangshi

Chaozhou opera also had two or three troupes performing in Shanghai a few years ago. They had footprints in the Great China Empire, but the time was very short, only a few months. Because there are not many Chaozhou sojourners and natives, and most people in Shanghai do not read Chaozhou dialect, there are very few who go to watch, so they cannot perform for a long time. I remember that the earliest Chaozhou opera troupe to come to Shanghai was more than ten years ago, and the performance location was at the Xiaowu Stage on Shantou Road.

Now, the Chaozhou opera being performed at the Queen's Theater is the Lao San Zheng Shunxiang troupe, which is very prestigious in Shantou. When it was performed at the Great China Theater a few years ago, I also went to watch it several times. I am not from Chaozhou, but I have been mingling with Chaozhou people for many years. I feel that the troupe's costumes and makeup are better than other Chaozhou opera troupes, without being old-fashioned or vulgar. At that time, they were rehearsing Yue Wumu, and the performance was very sincere and considerate, and the roles were very neat. Now that the old lover has returned to Shanghai, I will definitely take time to appreciate it once. I wonder what level its art has progressed to now? However, the ticket prices set by the troupe are too expensive and cannot be popularized, so it cannot be a widespread Chaozhou opera audience, right? I remember that when the troupe performed at the Great China Theater a few years ago, the ticket prices were only 80 cents, 60 cents, and 40 cents.

Speaking of Chaozhou opera music, it is slightly similar to Cantonese opera, but its eight interludes are incomparably quiet, much better than Cantonese opera, and even more different from Beijing and Cantonese operas. The rhythm is played in a melodious manner, which is fascinating. As for the roles, both the young male and female roles are children aged 10 to 16 or 17, because they take their crisp voices. If they reach puberty, their voices change, they cannot play young male and female roles, and they become old male and female clowns. The period for these roles is only a few years, relying on their natural voices. It is not like Beijing opera, where the voice can be sustained for life through long-term training, so the combination of Chaozhou opera in this field is quite different from other dramas.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

It is a pity that Sun Yukun and Hou Xirui have fallen

In the present day when Yang (Xiaolou) and Yu (Zhenting) have passed away, and Lao Shang (Heyu) has retired, Sun Yukun should indeed be the first choice among the new Ping martial male roles who can combine the strengths of the Yu and Yang schools, and who have both voice and body. Yukun, whose stage name is Xiaozhenting, is now in his forties. He has learned the essence of Xiaolou and Zhenting. He has neither the fatigue of Yang's later years nor the vigor of Xiaomaobaodu. Especially for painted-face plays such as "Yanyang Tower," "Iron Dragon Mountain," "Golden Leopard," and "Farewell My Concubine," if he suddenly appears on stage without explaining in advance that he is Sun Yukun, just looking at his appearance, stage steps, starting point, etc., it is really possible to mix pearls and fish eyes and impersonate Yu and Yang. Moreover, his naturally thin and long face also imitates Xiaolou by wearing his helmet particularly far back, and the face frame when painting his face occupies a slightly larger area, and the forehead occupies a strong third of the entire face. This makes him appear more imposing, so Xiaolou's Xiang Yu has the spirit of "strength to uproot mountains and cover the world" as soon as he comes out. Zhou Yitui (Ruian)'s body is not short either, but when you look at Ding Yi, you ridicule him as Little Overlord. On the contrary, Sun Yukun is not as good as his appearance. This shows the difference between the two in learning Yang's essence and not.

The earliest two to learn Yang were Sun, Zhou, and Li (Wanchun). Zhou has a leg that is not very energetic, and is too clumsy and too fiery. Every time he pulls a movement, he simply grits his teeth and exerts twelve points of energy. Wanchun is small in stature, so short-fought plays are okay, but long-clad plays clearly show a small demeanor. At the same time, his problem is that his legs have no roots, as if he can't lift them up. Singing martial males rely entirely on the waist and legs. If Zhou and Li lack leg work, they have already lost the conditions that a martial male should have. No matter how many people support them, they will never become first-class martial males. Although Lao Shang (Heyu)'s voice and appearance are not as good as Xiaolou's, he has been lucky for many years just by relying on his leg work. He stands on the stage as if he is a nail nailed there. If his legs have roots, of course he will look old and good-looking no matter what posture he puts on. Sun Yukun's body and legs are more energetic than Zhou and Li. He also has a lot of mouth strength when he reads a few sentences, and he looks a bit like Xiaolou. Ten years ago, he was very famous for performing in Peiping. Later, he became very close with his classmate Cui, and at the same time he developed both black and white hobbies, so his body gradually deteriorated, and he took a perfunctory approach to acting. In recent years, he has been almost ignored. Not only do foreign ports not think of inviting him, but also not many people in the old capital invite him to teach him. —(36)—

(IV) Storytelling

After talking about "ballad singing," it seems that we cannot let go of "storytelling" without talking about it.

Storytelling does not use musical instruments, nor does it have a backing. The materials are mostly historical stories: after listening to several segments of ballad singing with soft strings and gentle voices, one must come to a segment of relatively exciting and generous storytelling to make adjustments.

Generally speaking: ballad singing is always soft, and storytelling is always hard; but there are also exceptions, such as Dahongpao in ballad singing and Wensuchen in storytelling.

### Sun Min Studies Cosmetic Surgery

— Xinren

Regular Apprenticeship Ceremony Held

The suave actor Sun Min returned from Kunming in early spring and was immediately hired by Xinhua Company, signing a long-term contract. He has always been a good young man with a thirst for knowledge. Recently, he has become very interested in the career of cosmetic surgeons, which is developing quite rapidly. He is interested in all kinds of artificial cosmetic surgery, such as eyelid modification, sunken eye sockets, high nose surgery, wrinkle removal, and mole removal. In general, fashionable men and women in Burgeois Asia have their own needs, and it is also very beneficial in terms of makeup techniques. Last month, he specially asked someone to introduce him to Dr. Song Zibin of Shanghai Cosmetic Hospital and began to negotiate, expressing his intention to become an apprentice and learn the trade. According to Dr. Song, cosmetic surgery requires not only textbook knowledge, but also more practical experience, so he should often go there to practice in person. He also said: We might as well study together as friends, and there is no need to establish a teacher-student relationship. This is of course his humble words. After considering the results, Sun Min determined that going to practice after filming every day would not interfere with his job. After several continued consultations, he happily confirmed it the day before yesterday. At the same time, Sun Min also set up a banquet at the Kouyang Tea House on the 15th to hold an apprenticeship ceremony.

### Entertainment Tidbits

Li Zilin, a new actor at the Grand Theatre, arrived in Shanghai on the Shengjing round at 1:00 PM today. The theatre decided the night before last to invite female impersonator Chen Wangjun to join at the same time as Li.

The Yifeng Drama Society at the Carlton Theatre rehearsed three volumes of Wensuchen after the play last night, so they rehearsed the 13th and 14th volumes of Tian Yuhua early the night before last.

Female impersonator Wang Xichun was originally scheduled to start filming the Wensuchen film on the 20th, but because of the Dragon Boat Festival, she had to perform day shows at the Carlton Theatre, which conflicted with the scheduled plan, so she announced a postponement, and the date was not determined.

### The Pigsty Fire at Eight Immortals Bridge

Fires at Eight Immortals Bridge have been seen three times in ten days. Because there are many thatched huts in the area and the weather is extremely dry, a slight carelessness can easily lead to a fire. The Mixed Court has now ordered all thatched huts to be demolished within three days. The Fire God will have no way to incite violence. It is now known that the fire that burned the other day burned to death more than 530 pigs. Both sows and boars were reduced to ashes. Many pig herders lived there, and the pig pens were scattered. Because the fire spread quickly, the pigs staggered out but had no way out, so their flesh rotted and their skin burned, and they were piled on top of each other, all becoming ashes. An old glutton passed by and saw it, and exclaimed: "This is a wonderful roast pig!"

### Judge Lu's Magic

Recently, because the weather has been dry for a long time, an altar was set up to pray for rain, which has already been reported in the previous newspaper. (Note: See this column, issue 54.) Judge Lu wrote talismans and performed magic in the altar, chanting incantations. He pointed his sword at the jars, and the water could follow the sword down. When he lifted the sword, the water also followed it up. He also gave the sword to the officials praying for rain, and pointed it at their jar of water, and it also went up and down. This is also a demonstration of Judge Lu's magic. But the rain still did not come, which is also strange.

### Rice Prices in Suzhou

Suzhou received a welcome rain yesterday, but rice prices did not fall after the rain. Today, rice merchants are quoting prices starting at $2.50 per load, up to $3.30 per load. High-quality white Chen rice costs $3.60 per stone, and broken rice costs $3.70 per stone. It is heard that the price of Jiangning Jian rice ranges from 1,800 to 2,200 cash. Because 30 miles of river south of Changzhou City have dried up, all traffic to and from that place must be by land. Rice is a heavy object, and it is difficult to load and unload. Moreover, half of the rivers within Changzhou City have also dried up, so rice prices in Suzhou cannot be quickly leveled.
