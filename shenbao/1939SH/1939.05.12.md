### The Hua Army in Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan Provinces Are All Proceeding Smoothly, Continuing to Attack Nanchang, and Launching a Surprise Attack on Zaoshi. Japanese Troops Are Exhausted, Entrenched in Strongholds, and Dare Not Engage. Regimental Commander Yamada and Hundreds More Killed in Action

(Hong Kong) Yu telegram: As of the 10th, the Jiangxi Hua Army is still attacking Nanchang in an encirclement. The Hua Army reached within one or two miles of the city, achieving considerable gains. After the recapture of Zhanggongdu, the Japanese troops were extremely alarmed. A certain unit of the Hua Army crossed a tributary of the Fu River and has been attacking the Japanese troops everywhere for days, posing a significant threat. Fierce battles between the Hua Army and Japanese troops continue in Jing'an. (12th Special Dispatch)

(Changsha) From April 22nd to May 11th, the Hua Army launched offensives on various fronts in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan, with frequent reports of victories. Currently, in northern Jiangxi, the Hua Army is still focusing its attacks on Nanchang. All areas east of Nanchang, along the lake and river, south to Xiangtang, southwest via Wanshou Palace to Dacheng, northwest via Wanjiabu to Zhanggongdu, as well as the highways from Dacheng via Fengxin and Anyi to Zhanggongbo, and the areas of Jing'an and Wuning, are all battlegrounds where Hua attacking units operate freely. The two highways between Yangxin and Echeng in southern Hubei, and between Xianning and Tongcheng, as well as the section from Nanlinqiao to Xintanpu, and the railway area north of Yuezhou in northern Hunan, are also rife with the activity of Hua attacking units. The few strongholds and lines held by the Japanese in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan have been shattered by the Hua Army. The two division units of the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi, a certain division and a part of another division, and the remaining remnants of yet another division in southern Hubei and northern Hunan, have suffered heavy casualties and are exhausted due to the Hua Army's offensive. They are now only entrenched in their strongholds, not daring to venture out to engage the Hua Army. To avoid attacking fortified positions, the Hua Army is now adopting a new strategy of combining guerrilla warfare with mobile warfare, seeking to annihilate the main force of the Japanese army. (11th Dispatch)

A Certain Location: Since the Hua Army launched successive offensives on various fronts in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan, starting on the 22nd of last month, victories have been reported frequently. A reporter specially went to the front lines to visit General Yue and pay respects. The general was humble and, using matches placed on the table, illustrated the situation between the Hua and Japanese armies in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan, discussing the war situation. He first gave a general introduction and then expressed his views, saying that in these two weeks, hardly a day has passed without the Hua Army recapturing or cutting off the few strongholds and lines held by the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan. The Hua Army has been attacking the Japanese army, shattering their formations and preventing them from coordinating with each other. The Japanese losses and casualties are several times greater than those of the Hua Army, and their exhaustion is extreme. Even the Japanese XXth Division, which suffered heavy casualties in Wuning previously, had its remnants transferred to Xianning for reorganization, but was still forced to fight in the Nanlinqiao area due to the Hua Army's offensive, without any respite. The casualties suffered by the Japanese XXth Division and the hardship of the Japanese army, which is rushing around to cope with the Hua offensive, can be easily imagined. Currently, the Hua Army is in a proactive position, constantly attacking the Japanese army at any time and in any place, leaving them at their wit's end and unable to cope or retaliate. They can only entrench themselves in their strongholds and dare not come out to engage. Okamura Neji, the Japanese commander in the Poyang and Dongting Lake area, known for his bravery and resourcefulness, seems to be at a loss in the face of this kind of attack from the Hua Army. The General also told the reporter that the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan, has exposed its weaknesses through this offensive by the Hua Army. (11th Dispatch)

Fengcheng: On the 11th at noon, units of the Hua Army advancing towards Lehua (north of Nanchang) and Nanjingiao encountered over two hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry near Daludang. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese retreated in defeat towards Lehua. The Hua Army killed the Japanese company commander Nakazawa and over fifty soldiers, captured over twenty rifles, two pistols, eight horses, and many other military supplies and documents. (11th Dispatch)

Zhangshu: Units of the Hua Army attacking Anyi occupied Hushan, northwest of Anyi, on the evening of the 7th. At dawn on the 8th, they had approached the northern suburbs of Anyi City and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese. The battle lasted until noon, when the Japanese counterattacked with reinforcements from Jing'an. The Hua Army retreated to the vicinity of Hushan and continued fighting. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and over eight hundred items of war booty were captured. (11th Dispatch)

Shashi: On the evening of the 10th, a certain unit of the Hua Army launched a sudden and fierce attack on Zaoshi. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and responded hastily. The Hua Army charged back and forth, throwing the Japanese formation into chaos. In the process, they killed the Japanese artillery regimental commander, Colonel Yamada, and three to four hundred officers and soldiers. The Japanese troops from Ying Mountain and Jing Mountain quickly arrived to reinforce, and the Hua Army safely retreated to a certain location. (11th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Hua Army declared today that the Hua side has indeed adopted a "war of attrition" strategy against the Japanese, making the Japanese army "exhausted". This strategy is repeatedly implemented through large-scale offensives, the purpose of which is to prevent the Japanese army from concentrating large forces in any area. The Hua Army's offensive against Anqing and Xuzhou is an example of implementing this strategy. On the Nanchang front, the Hua Army is only six miles from the city on three sides, and on the south side, they are stopping the vanguard of the Japanese troops at a distance of twenty miles from the city. (May 11th Associated Press)

Shashi: Since a certain unit of the Hua Army in eastern Hubei launched offensives towards Huang'an, Hekou, Wangcheng, Tuanfeng, and Xinzhou in recent days, it has made rapid progress and achieved many gains. In the battle of Zhongguan Station, over three hundred Japanese soldiers were killed and many guns and ammunition were captured. In the battle of Tuanfeng, over one hundred and seventy Japanese soldiers were killed. In the battle of Bailing, west of Huang'an, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed.

Combining the results of the battles in this area, over one thousand two hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. (11th Dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to an information officer of the Japanese Naval Department, the Japanese army currently concentrated in central China numbers over one million. Recent actions are focused on air raids and blockades of the Chinese coast. He also stated that a large force of the Hua Army is concentrated between Yuezhou and Changsha, accounting for 35% of the total Hua Army. (11th Haitong Dispatch)

### Guangdong Hua Army Fiercely Attacks Jiangmen and Xinhui. Japanese Troops Harassing Bao'an and Nantou Have Been Repelled. Hua Guerrillas Briefly Entered Guangzhou City.

### Overseas Chinese Representatives in China Telegraph the US President, etc., Requesting a Ban on the Export of Military Supplies to Japan. Large-Scale Massacres of Civilians by the Japanese Further Increase China's Determination to Resist. The US Continues to Aid Japan with Munitions, Sharing Responsibility for the Crime of Destroying Humanity

(Chongqing) Japanese aircraft wreak havoc, and foreigners in Chongqing are deeply indignant. American residents feel uneasy about the continued supply of war materials to Japan. Therefore, on May 10th, Fei Wusheng, representing the signatories, telegraphed Roosevelt, Hull, Pittman, McLean, etc., requesting an immediate ban on the export of arms and military supplies to aggressor countries. The translated text of the original telegram is as follows: To President Roosevelt of Washington, Secretary of State Hull, Senator Pittman, and Congressman McLean: Recent Japanese air raids on Chongqing and large-scale massacres of civilians have deeply shocked American residents in Chongqing. The bravery and determination of the Chinese people are unshakable. This indescribable tragic experience further increases their determination to resist. We protest the so-called neutrality of the United States, which for twenty-two months has been constantly selling oil, metal, cotton, machinery, etc., to Japan, making the United States share the responsibility for Japan's crime of destroying humanity. In the name of God, we request the establishment and implementation of a national policy that prohibits the export of all items used by aggressors for war. Fei Wusheng respectfully. (11th Dispatch)

### The National Government Urges All Parties to Refuse to Accept the Hua Xing Counterfeit Currency. Hua Xing Controls Shanghai's Finances and Issues Counterfeit Currency. It Will Deal a Serious Blow to the Interests of Foreigners in China. The Chinese Government Will Be Forced to Take Countermeasures

(Chongqing) Today, the National Government urged all relevant parties in China to refuse to accept the banknotes issued by the "Hua Xing Bank", and at the same time declared that the Chinese government will be forced to take action to deal with the new currency system. According to an analysis by a government spokesman, "The new currency system is clearly intended to help the Japanese control Shanghai's financial institutions." The spokesman also pointed out that "foreign parties are extremely concerned about the stability of Shanghai's finances. After the Japanese implement control, it will deal a serious blow to the interests of foreigners in China. Furthermore, this plan has shown Japan's economic distress. Japan needs cash to support its war of aggression against China and its puppet regime. Currently, the Japanese are vigorously plundering and exploiting in the occupied areas. After the establishment of the 'United Reserve Bank' in North China, the worthless paper that could not be exchanged was forced upon the people. This policy of plundering is nearing its end, but Japan's need for funds is still extremely urgent. Therefore, it has no choice but to turn its attention to central China. Given the failure of the counterfeit currency in North China, unless the Japanese army uses bayonets as a backing, the people in central China will never accept this worthless new counterfeit currency. In short, the people are extremely clear about this situation. No matter how ingenious the Japanese smokescreen is, the Japanese conspiracy will never succeed. The Chinese government will naturally take appropriate countermeasures, and at the same time, we do not believe that foreign banks will accept this worthless new counterfeit currency or establish other relations with the 'Hua Xing Bank'. In order to maintain their own interests, these banks and all parties should do their utmost to maintain the Chinese legal currency. Moreover, in November 1935, the British authorities issued a statement stipulating that the Chinese legal currency was the legal currency for Sino-British trade. We expect that foreign parties will take appropriate action to protect their interests and that these governments will also lodge protests with the Japanese." Regarding China's countermeasures, the spokesman declined to comment. He pointed out that since the counterfeit currency in North China cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange, the new counterfeit currency of the "Hua Xing Bank" will not be able to obtain foreign exchange either. (May 11th Associated Press)

(Tokyo) Today, the Japan Times published a long article discussing the establishment of the Hua Xing Bank in Shanghai by the China Development Corporation, stating that the authorities in central China will have the opportunity to establish policies for overseas trade and control foreign exchange, because otherwise, the complete and compulsory circulation of the new currency of the Hua Xing Bank will not be possible. (May 11th Reuters)

### Japanese Navy Spokesman Declares That the Yangtze River Is Only for Japanese Military Transport and Will Be Opened After the End of the War. There are a Million Japanese Troops in China

(Tokyo) Today, Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesman for the Japanese Naval Department, declared at the weekly press briefing that the Yangtze River is only allowed to be used by transport ships carrying supplies and ammunition for the Japanese army, and ordinary commercial ships are not allowed to navigate, because the million Japanese troops fighting in central China, that is, on both sides of the Yangtze River, completely rely on the Yangtze River as their only transportation route. The above situation can explain the reason why the Yangtze River is full of Japanese warships. It is not easy to supply the food, clothing, and ammunition for a million troops. The restrictions on navigation on the Yangtze River are required for various strategic reasons. Once Japan achieves its goal of overthrowing the Chinese government, the restrictions can be lifted, and Japan's relations with various countries can be improved. Japan is currently taking various measures to achieve its goals, such as resuming fierce military operations along the long front lines, launching fierce air raids on various Chinese military strongholds, and strengthening the blockade of the Chinese coast. The spokesman also mentioned the current battles in northern Hubei and southern Henan, saying that the general public may not have paid attention to these battles because they did not involve larger cities, but the battles in northern Hubei and southern Henan are indeed of military importance. Japan's victory in these two areas will not only eliminate one-third of the Chinese army in central China, but also remove the threat posed by the Chinese army to the north of Hankou. (May 11th Reuters)

### Hua Army in Shandong Province Recaptures Fei County

Editorial

### A Plea for Shanghai

Those concerned about the current state of Shanghai almost universally acknowledge that it is not right, feeling uneasy about it, and even deeply regretting the unpleasantness of various developments. Why is it not right? Examples are too numerous to list. In short, it is due to the failure to maintain a reasonable normalcy. Why is there unease? Crises lurk everywhere, dangers abound, and even if one compromises and reluctantly endures, one may not ultimately be able to preserve everything intact. Why is there regret? No matter what aspect, what idea, what intention, whether tending toward evil or toward good, whether stooping to baseness or aspiring to brightness, there is not a single matter or person that can fully realize its desires. As a member of the current situation, we naturally cannot remain aloof from it. The inability to clearly list examples and speak frankly is also one aspect of the overall situation.

Those concerned about the current state of Shanghai are not limited to the natives of Shanghai and foreign residents. Newspapers and magazines in various countries do not hesitate to dedicate space to publishing telegrams or dispatches related to Shanghai. This is a supply that adapts to the need, which shows the large number of those concerned. For example, the British House of Commons met the day before yesterday to discuss the Conscription Bill and the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. These are matters that not only concern the safety and prosperity of Great Britain, but also the future trends of the world situation, as the internal and foreign affairs discussed are all major events. During the session, Sir Haslam, a Conservative Member of Parliament, asked the government: "The areas surrounding the Shanghai International Settlement are in disarray, and law and order have collapsed. The authorities of the International Settlement are experiencing difficulties in maintaining order within the settlement. I wonder if Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to negotiate with the Japanese government to urge them to pay attention to this?" Foreign Secretary Butler replied that the British government had already asked the Japanese authorities to pay attention to these difficulties. This single question and answer shows how deeply concerned various parties are about the current state of Shanghai.

However, no matter how many are concerned about the current state of Shanghai, how deep their concern is, no matter how many questions are asked, how much attention is paid, it is still impossible to correct the impropriety of the current state or relieve the unease of the current state. The way Shanghai is today is due to its larger environment. People have likened the obstruction of Shanghai's foreign communications to an isolated island, which is already deeply tragic. Looking down on this isolated island, one sees that it is surrounded by typhoons and terrifying waves, which can destroy it at any time; earthquakes and tsunamis, which can sink it at any time. With such a dangerous larger environment, how can one hope for individual well-being and peace? The statement that it is difficult to maintain order in the concessions due to the chaos and collapse of law and order in the surrounding areas can explain the failure of the concessions to achieve individual well-being and peace. But why are the surrounding areas in such chaos and collapse of law and order? Is the reason for this in the areas themselves, such as Zhabei in western Shanghai? Layer upon layer of scrutiny reveals the key to the problem. Therefore, living in Shanghai, while deeply grateful for the concern of all parties for Shanghai, and especially grateful to the British Parliament for its ability to care about Shanghai even while deliberating on major policies, we deeply hope that all parties will not be overly concerned about Shanghai, but rather be concerned about the Far East as a whole. We deeply hope that the British Parliament, instead of being concerned about Shanghai, asking questions about Shanghai, and seeking to save Shanghai, would be concerned about the entire Far East, asking questions about the entire Far East, and seeking to save the entire Far East. If the Far East is not at peace, how can Shanghai alone be at peace!

These words are not meant to advocate for resignation to fate like a fatalist. To view individuals from the perspective of the nation is to see individuals as insignificant and unworthy of mention. Similarly, to view the present from the perspective of history is to see the moment as fleeting and unworthy of mention. The entire Far Eastern problem must be resolved. From the perspective of the Far East, the issues of Shanghai's governance, disorder, safety, and danger are indeed minor and unworthy of mention. Even focusing on Shanghai alone, the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War will be determined by the overall situation, by the final outcome. Whatever gains or losses Shanghai may experience now are not sufficient to determine the outcome. One who ultimately wins the overall victory will never be defeated in Shanghai alone, and one who ultimately fails completely will never be able to win in Shanghai. This is not only true for the warring parties, but also for the interests of any third country. If Europeans and Americans are expelled from the Far East after the war, how can they retain Shanghai alone, and what benefit would they derive from retaining Shanghai alone? Therefore, to work for the preservation of Shanghai, one must also work for the stability of the Far East. Is it not foolish to be preoccupied with Shanghai alone?

These words are not meant to suggest that Shanghai should be lightly abandoned. One should not lightly abandon what rightfully belongs to one. The key is to understand that the distinction between gain and loss, honor and disgrace, is tied to something other than Shanghai. One should abide by one's duty and prioritize the recognition of all legally established positions. Theories may differ, but adhering to the law is reasonable, and only by adhering to the law can one maintain normalcy. If one can expect each other to adhere to the law, then there is no need for compromise or reluctance. In fact, compromise and reluctance are violations of the law. When those who enforce the law violate the law, they are like those who break the law disrupting the law. Violating the law and disrupting the law are both forms of destroying the law. If the law is destroyed, there is nothing to abide by, and everyone ends up seeking to satisfy their own desires, ultimately leading to mutual destruction. Such destruction is internal collapse and cannot be attributed to the larger environment. There is a Chinese saying, "Those who commit their own sins cannot live." This is indeed a natural law, and this cause and effect applies equally to China, Japan, Europe, and the United States.

(Chongqing) Garrison Commander Liu Zhi Visits Various Embassies and Consulates, Expressing Deep Concern and Investigating Losses Suffered; National Government Appoints He Guoguang as Mayor of Chongqing; Japanese Newspaper Makes Overtly Threatening Remarks Against the British Ambassador

(Chongqing) Chongqing Garrison Commander Liu Zhi, representing the government today, visited various foreign embassies and consulates to express his deep concern regarding the Japanese air raid on May 4th, and to investigate the extent of the losses suffered and the number of casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Chongqing) A Reuters reporter today showed a certain Chinese official a report in the Japanese Kokumin Shimbun of May 6th stating that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife had left for Chengdu together by plane. The official replied that this statement was extremely absurd and not worth criticizing. The Reuters reporter learned from responsible sources that when the British Ambassador flew to Chengdu, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife were both in Chongqing, supervising the relief work for the victims of the Japanese air raids on May 3rd and 4th. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Tokyo) The Kokumin Shimbun, the mouthpiece of the Japanese Army, today published remarks threatening the personal safety of British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, stating that according to accurate information received by the Japanese side, the British Ambassador's activities in Chongqing were aimed at facilitating British assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's resistance against Japan. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr accompanied Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife on a flight from Chongqing on May 6th, using his position as ambassador to protect the lives of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and others. This act has greatly angered Japanese public opinion. If Sir Archibald Clark Kerr continues to freely enter and exit war zones and abuse his special diplomatic privileges in the future, Japan will not be able to guarantee his safety. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Chongqing) According to reliable sources, He Guoguang, the former Director of the Chongqing Provisional Headquarters, will soon be appointed as the Mayor of Chongqing. His future responsibilities will be particularly significant: (1) Supervising the rescue and treatment of people injured in the Japanese air raids of May 3rd and 4th; (2) Arranging for the evacuation of Chongqing residents to avoid further casualties during future Japanese air raids; (3) Repairing the damage caused by last week's Japanese air raids. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Chongqing) The National Government ordered on the 11th: (1) Chiang Chih-cheng, Mayor of Chongqing, Sichuan, is hereby relieved of his post. (2) He Guoguang is hereby appointed as Mayor of Chongqing. (Dispatch on the 11th)

Evacuation of Chongqing Residents Continues

(Chongqing) The National Government yesterday promulgated a decree advising all non-working personnel in Chongqing, including women and children, to evacuate to various locations. Only those with official residence permits will be allowed to remain in Chongqing. Foreign nationals wishing to reside in Chongqing must also apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a foreign national residence permit. It is understood that the purpose of this measure by the Central Government is to minimize losses from Japanese air raids. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 11th)

(Chongqing) According to authoritative sources, the Chinese government has decided not to relocate to Chengdu. However, a small number of important agencies are currently considering relocating to towns near Chongqing. The evacuation of Chongqing residents is continuing actively. Reconstruction work after the Japanese air raids is progressing rapidly, like bamboo shoots after rain. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and several high-ranking government officials inspected various locations yesterday and personally comforted the affected refugees. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

U.S. Embassy Plans to Establish New Measures

(Chongqing) The U.S. Embassy here is currently planning a method to divide the entire city into five districts, with one person responsible for each district. In the event of a Japanese air raid, if American citizens' lives or property are damaged, the person responsible for each district will immediately report to the U.S. Embassy. The persons responsible for each district have already been appointed. This measure will enable the embassy authorities to immediately learn the extent of damage to American citizens' property and lives in the event of an air raid. The British Consul, who went to Jiangnan for several days, has returned to the city today and notified British citizens remaining in Chongqing that it is best to relocate to the mountains in Jiangnan. It is heard that most British citizens, mostly women and children, have agreed to the British Consulate's request. The French Consulate, although heavily damaged in the recent Japanese air raids, has reopened. According to French Consulate officials, the consulate has excellent air raid shelters and therefore does not need to relocate. Although it has been a week since the recent Japanese air raids, staff are still engaged in clearing rubble and removing corpses. At the same time, the wages for excavating corpses are very expensive due to the unbearable stench of decaying corpses, now reaching five yuan in legal tender per corpse. The English-language "Chungking News" resumed publication today. As for the nine Chinese-language newspapers, they are still publishing a combined edition, but some of them may soon publish independently. According to informed sources, the Chinese government now hopes that the newspapers will relocate to other areas that lack newspapers, as having nine newspapers in Chongqing is exceeding local needs, especially in the current situation. Therefore, the government's attitude is that if the newspapers do not relocate elsewhere, it will not provide further assistance to their reconstruction efforts. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

Generalissimo Chiang's Car Transports Refugees

(Chongqing) The U.S. Embassy has not yet notified American citizens to leave Chongqing, but the German Embassy has today requested all German citizens to leave Chongqing immediately. The population of Chongqing is gradually increasing again, as people who fled to villages outside the city have returned to the city. However, the government is still continuing to transport people out of the city by truck free of charge, or by ferry across the river. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's personal car is also carrying refugees out of the city all day long. Before entering Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's personal car, an old woman who had never ridden in a car, carrying her only bundle, prostrated herself towards the sky three times to express her gratitude. Furthermore, when Madam Soong Mei-ling was inspecting the city, she saw many refugees returning from outside the city. Madam Soong found this strange and asked her staff. They said that these refugees were very hurried when they left the city and forgot to bring their belongings. They were transported out of the city by truck when they left the city, but they returned to the city on foot. After hearing this, Madam Soong felt great sorrow and immediately ordered that they be sent out of the city again by truck. According to reports from foreign hospitals, many civilians were injured in the Japanese air raids, but because the injuries were too severe, they were still able to escape to the countryside while injured. They are now returning to the city one after another to seek treatment at hospitals. According to most of the common people, they want to remain in Chongqing because their families and businesses are here. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

(Chongqing) Today, the authorities specially transferred troops from outside the city into the city to help the local defense forces maintain order and evacuate refugees from the city. Also today, the Chinese side declared that there is "absolutely no need" to immediately implement a full evacuation order. A large number of people are returning to the city from the countryside, and shops are gradually reopening. The streets in some areas were as crowded last night as they used to be. Also today, the authorities issued an order instructing shop employees or workers in bombed shops to register immediately so that they can be sent to work in the new cooperatives that are currently being established. These new cooperatives will assist in the production of wartime necessities, similar to the work of the New Life Movement Industrial Camps. Most of the new cooperatives will be located in the suburbs of major cities to avoid being devastated by Japanese air raids. According to foreign businessmen, the Japanese air raids have caused business losses in Chongqing of several million yuan per month. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

Sichuan Newspaper Urges Britain to Awaken

(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily News today published an article commenting on the telegram sent by British Members of Parliament to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek expressing their friendship, warmly welcoming the passage in the article stating that they believed China should be included in any peace goals set by democratic countries, saying that if China is not allowed to be included in this goal, then its exclusion will be a regrettable loss to the goal and its strength and value, and its strength to resist aggression will be greatly reduced. Any anti-aggression front cannot ignore the Far East or China. Not only has the Soviet Union always held this attitude, but the peace-loving people of the United States and Britain also attach great importance to China's resistance. The British government has so far hesitated to take a firm stance, fearing to provoke Japan's hostility. Today, Britain often knows Japan's attitude towards Britain. For example, the Japanese newspapers' open criticism of Britain, the anti-British movement in the Chinese areas occupied by the Japanese army, the insults and abuse of British citizens, and the bombing of the British Consulate General in Chongqing are all ironclad evidence. All these actions cannot be regarded as friendly gestures. Japan has now taken China's freedom and independence and the interests of British citizens in the Far East as spoils of victory in the war against China. If the British government does not disregard its obligation to protect the rights and interests of British citizens in China, it cannot continue to hesitate. The newspaper also refutes the British government's argument that it intends to resolve the European dispute first and then deal with the Far East crisis, saying that even if the point that peace is inseparable is not mentioned, the anti-aggression front must deal with disputes one by one, but it is logically sound for democratic countries to first deal with the Far East issue, because Japan has been exhausted after twenty-three months of war, and any active steps by democratic countries are enough to make it yield, and the resolution of the Far East crisis will definitely have a favorable impact on the overall situation in Europe. The article concludes by hoping that the British government, for its own interests, for the happiness of the British people, and to maintain public opinion, will allow China to join the collective peace goal of curbing aggression. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(London) Several questions were asked in the House of Commons today regarding the Japanese bombing of Chongqing. Foreign Office Undersecretary Butler replied that during the air raid on May 4th, a bomb hit the dormitory of the Chinese staff of the British Consulate, killing two Chinese staff members and injuring eleven. Foreign Secretary Halifax is currently awaiting a detailed report on the overall results of the air raid. Britain has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government. Butler also assured Labour MP Williams in response to a question that the British side had also expressed its opposition to the bombing. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### British Far East Policy Unchanged; Upholding the Principles of the Nine-Power Treaty; Remarks by the British Undersecretary in the House of Commons

During the House of Commons session today, Labour MP Sorensen asked that, in view of the recent Japanese government's decision not to conclude a more complete alliance with Germany and Italy for military and other purposes, the Prime Minister should immediately proceed to present the following matters to the Japanese government: (1) Cease aggressive actions in China; (2) Withdraw Japanese troops in China; and (3) All relevant countries should immediately convene a Far East conference to discuss non-aggression and equitable economic cooperation. Foreign Office Undersecretary Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax had only seen news reports regarding the Japanese government's decision. The British government's opinion was fully expressed in the note sent to the Japanese government on January 14th of this year, which solemnly stated Britain's intention to adhere to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty.

### Britain Invites Molotov to Participate in Geneva Talks; Collective Security for Europe; Eager to Eliminate Misunderstandings as Soon as Possible

(London) According to authorities here, Foreign Secretary Halifax telegraphed the Soviet foreign ministry yesterday, requesting the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, to attend this year's League of Nations General Assembly, so that he could hold personal talks with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and other countries, to eliminate the various obstacles and misunderstandings preventing the Soviet Union from supporting Britain and France in guaranteeing European security. Political figures here are quite hopeful about the Foreign Secretary's move. Many believe that even if Molotov cannot come to Geneva in person, Deputy Commissar Potemkin will at least attend the League of Nations Assembly on his behalf with full powers to discuss with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and other countries the extent to which the Soviet Union can contribute to assistance and guarantees. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 11th)

(London) Well-informed sources have recently stated that the government has invited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov to go to Geneva during the League of Nations Council meeting (on the 15th of this month), so that he can conduct negotiations with Foreign Secretary Halifax on the matter of the anti-aggression group. This matter is of utmost importance and must be concluded as soon as possible. The government has also instructed British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds to visit Molotov again, to clearly state to him that if Poland and Romania are indeed subjected to aggression in the future, Britain and France will only request Soviet assistance after they have dispatched troops to aid them. In addition, Sir Seeds should also convey to Molotov the declaration made by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons this afternoon, informing him that Britain's intentions are sincere, and Foreign Secretary Halifax is eager to meet with Soviet foreign ministry officials in Geneva to explain in detail the doubts of the Soviet government regarding Britain's new proposal. In short, it is hoped that the Soviet Union, whether represented by People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov or Deputy Commissar Potemkin, will bring to the League of Nations Council meeting the Soviet government's response to Britain's new proposal and will have full powers to conclude negotiations. Britain's intention not to conclude a treaty of alliance with the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly firm, and it is deeply hoped that the Soviet Union will eventually accept Britain's proposal, thereby completing the collective security system. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(Paris) According to yesterday's "Le Jour," representatives of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland will hold a four-nation meeting in Geneva while attending the League of Nations General Assembly. The newspaper continued to say that politicians are no longer interested in the affairs of the League of Nations, but only feel that by taking the opportunity of the League of Nations meeting, they can make diplomatic contacts with various countries, avoiding the attention of other countries. It is learned that during the League of Nations meeting, British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, Polish Foreign Minister Beck, and Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin will personally discuss everything. In addition, it is also possible to take this opportunity to make contacts with representatives from Turkey, Romania, Greece, and the Scandinavian countries. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

(Moscow) When British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, he said that misunderstandings had occurred in the negotiations between Britain and Russia. Diplomatic figures here recently stated that it is difficult to know where these misunderstandings came from. What can be said is that these negotiations were already in a complicated state, and now, in response to the misunderstandings, explanations are being made about the crux of the matter, and the situation of the negotiations has thus become clearer. The British government's request to the Soviet Union is that if Poland and Romania are subjected to aggression, and Britain and France dispatch troops to aid them, then the Soviet Union should also participate. However, the Soviet Union, because Britain and France did not require the Soviet Union to accept obligations to Poland and Romania, fears that if the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression in the future, Britain and France may sit idly by because they are not obligated, and therefore hope to conclude a direct mutual assistance treaty with Britain and France. The differences in opinions between the two sides lie here. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Moscow Newspaper Discusses the European Situation; Rights and Obligations Must Be Equal

(Moscow) The government newspaper Izvestia, which has not discussed the international situation for some time, published an editorial today discussing international issues, stating that there have recently been two extremely important international events: one is the political and military treaty agreed upon by the German and Italian foreign ministry officials in Milan, and the other is the speech made by German leader Hitler on the 28th of last month. All of these are sufficient to prove that the international situation is deteriorating. Taking Hitler's speech as an example, the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement have been declared invalid, and the importance of their nature can be seen. As for the German-Italian political and military treaty, it is extremely important that the countries will promote the same policies in diplomacy and military affairs in the future. Since Germany occupied Czechoslovakia and Italy annexed Albania, the democratic countries of Western Europe have intensified their efforts to find the necessary methods to establish a unified anti-aggression front. Britain, France, and the Soviet Union also began negotiations. The Soviet Union's position is based on the two principles of mutual assistance and equal obligations, but Britain and France have failed to sympathize with this. After obtaining France's agreement, Britain put forward a counterproposal, completely omitting the issue of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union concluding a mutual assistance agreement, only stating that if Britain and France take military action to aid Poland and Romania, the Soviet Union should immediately provide assistance. As for what kind of assistance the Soviet Union should obtain from Britain and France according to the principle of reciprocity, the British side did not mention a single word. In this way, the position of the Soviet Union is not equal, and according to this method, whether to effectively resist aggression when it occurs in the future, and when to resist, must also be transferred to the opinions of Britain or France. How can this be called a proper way? (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Soviet-Polish Amicable Talks; Britain and France Attach Unusual Importance; Important Progress Will Be Made in the Anti-Aggression Organization; Potemkin Leaves Warsaw for Moscow

Warsaw Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin held talks with Foreign Minister Beck this afternoon for two hours and then boarded a train at 4:45 PM to return to Moscow. Soviet personnel here have expressed satisfaction with the results of the talks. It is heard that Potemkin's trip was decided by the Soviet side. During his meeting with Foreign Minister Beck today, he discussed the following three matters: (1) The general situation; (2) Mutual guarantees between the Soviet Union and the Baltic countries and Romania; (3) The attitudes of the Soviet Union and Poland towards Britain's new proposal (regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group). Although no decisions were made at the end of the talks, Potemkin will report the Polish government's views to People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. This is of great importance to the future development of British-Soviet negotiations. In addition, Polish political figures have said that the improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, which has been clearly demonstrated by Potemkin's trip, is gratifying. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(London) British and French newspapers today attached importance to the meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin. Since Beck signed the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact in Moscow in 1934, this is the first time Beck has met with Soviet leaders. Potemkin returned to Moscow via Ankara, Turkey, Sofia, Bulgaria, Bucharest, Romania, and held friendly talks with Beck in Warsaw. This matter is bound to have an important relationship with the current anti-aggression movement in Europe. The Daily Herald's Warsaw dispatch said that Poland is now preparing to sign another alliance with the Soviet Union, stipulating that Poland will not only receive assistance from Britain and France in the event of aggression, but also direct assistance from the Soviet Union. London newspapers also believe that the Baltic issue was reviewed during the Warsaw talks. Some diplomatic reporters, when guessing the Soviet Union's reply to the British answer, said that the Soviet Union intends to extend its guarantee to the Baltic countries, allowing Estonia and Latvia. The diplomatic reporter Bartlett of the News Chronicle believes that Britain may not reject this request. Le Temps in Paris commented on the strengthening of relations between Warsaw and Moscow, saying that to make this rapprochement an alliance, only the compromise of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is needed. The London Daily Express said that British-Turkish negotiations are about to be completed, and it is heard that Turkey has agreed to accept Soviet military assistance in the defense of the Balkan countries. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Paris) Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin's talks with the Polish Foreign Minister were recently commented on by responsible figures here, who said that one of the goals of the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is to reduce the threats faced by the Baltic countries. If the Soviet Union and Poland can cooperate, this goal can be achieved. Regarding the organization of the anti-aggression group, the Soviet Union criticized Britain's new proposal, saying that it did not eliminate the crisis of conflict in Eastern Europe, especially in the Baltic region. Once something happened, the Soviet Union would inevitably be involved alone, while Britain and France would stand aside. This is not what the Soviet Union wants to hear. Responsible figures in France also admitted that the relations of the Baltic countries are important. If Germany attacks the Polish Corridor, its land is between Germany's Pomerania and East Prussia, and it may be attacked from both sides, which is difficult to resist. In fact, it is difficult to resist, and assistance can only be provided from East Prussia to the east, namely Lithuania. For this reason, the Soviet Union is now working hard to urge Britain and France to provide guarantees for the Baltic countries. The goals of the current negotiations between the Soviet Union and Poland and the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are to prevent this crisis. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(Berlin) Regarding the talks between Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in Warsaw, newspapers here commented on it this morning. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung pointed out that in September of last year, when the situation in Europe was tense, Potemkin, on behalf of the Soviet government, notified the Polish representative in the Soviet Union that if Poland attacked Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union believed that the Soviet-Polish pact would automatically become invalid. At that time, this notice caused great indignation in Warsaw. Is it not a coincidence that Potemkin has now been ordered to hold talks with the Polish Foreign Minister? The Financial Times declared that the message transmitted by the Polish news agency, that if Poland joined the Eastern European aggression, Germany would unite with the condition of distributing the scope of interests, including the Caucasus, Ukraine, Russia, and the Baltic countries, was "completely fabricated by Poland out of nothing." (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations: The Crux of the Matter Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons, Saying Misunderstandings Are Not Difficult to Clear Up

(London) This afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons, briefly outlining the progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. He first mentioned the Soviet government's announcement regarding the British government's proposed suggestions, stating that the announcement seemed to misunderstand the actual proposals put forth by Britain. Since talks are currently underway, the House should not expect to debate the matter. The Prime Minister believed that since Moscow now has this announcement, it is his responsibility to make the House aware of the general approach taken thus far in the talks. The government had previously announced that if any country in Eastern Europe resisted any attempt to threaten its independence, Britain intended to provide assistance. The government's current policy has caused this Eastern European country to hesitate in accepting a definite obligation. The reason the government did not invite the Soviet government to participate but instead took on this obligation itself was because it was aware that making such a request would inevitably cause some difficulties. Therefore, the government requested the Soviet government to publish its own declaration with the same effect as the commitment announced by the British government, stating that if Britain and France were drawn into a war due to the fulfillment of their obligations, the Soviet government would be prepared to provide assistance to Britain and France when they were willing. In the British government's view, such a declaration, if the Soviet government felt it could be issued, seemed to be consistent with Stalin's recent public announcement that the Soviet government's policy was to assist those countries that are victims of aggression and prepared to defend their own independence. The Soviet government almost simultaneously proposed a plan that was broader and more comprehensive than the British government's suggestion. Regardless of any other benefits of this plan, the British government currently believes it would inevitably cause the difficulties that the Soviet Union itself wants to avoid. Therefore, the British government explained the existence of these difficulties to the Soviet government, while also making some revisions to the original proposal submitted to the Soviet Union and agreeing to emphasize that the British government did not want the Soviet government to bind itself, regardless of whether Britain and France had fulfilled their obligations, and must fulfill its obligation to participate in the war. The British government stated that it had no objection if the Soviet government voluntarily participated when Britain and France were at war. Foreign Secretary Halifax assured Soviet Ambassador Maisky that this was not the intention of the British government's proposal. If the Soviet Union had any doubts about this, Britain could dispel them without difficulty. Therefore, the Foreign Secretary told Maisky that if this concern still existed, he should allow the British government to know the real reasons for the Soviet Union's doubts. Maisky agreed to do so. The Prime Minister continued, stating that British Ambassador to Moscow Sir Seeds had met with Soviet Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov two days ago and discussed the matter at length. After the discussion, Molotov agreed to give the British proposal careful consideration. The British government is now awaiting the Soviet Union's reply. (Reuters, 10th)

### Lithuanian-Polish Relations Return to Normal: Lithuania Determined to Uphold Independence

Warsaw General Rastikis, Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army, visited army exercises in Ren Bai Duo Fu City today. After returning here, he gave a speech to the newspapers, praising the Polish army as elite and saying, "Lithuania's foreign policy has always emphasized conservative neutrality, but if national independence is threatened, it will definitely be upheld, even if there is only one soldier left. This policy has been fully understood by the Polish side, and its attitude towards our country is based on sincerity and sympathy. After conducting talks with the Polish authorities, I am deeply convinced of this, which is gratifying. In short, relations between the two countries have now returned to normal, and it is certain that good neighborliness and active cooperation can be increased in the future to suit the allied relations passed down from generation to generation between the peoples of both sides." General Rastikis then departed in the evening to inspect the newly built national defense industrial area, and after completing the matter, he will return to his country directly from there.

### Nordic Four Nations Decide to Strictly Maintain Neutrality: Supply of Raw Materials During Wartime Will Be Treated Equally to Germany and the Soviet Union

(Moscow) After the foreign ministers of the four Nordic countries, namely Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, held a meeting in the Swedish capital yesterday and decided to strictly maintain neutrality, information has been received here stating that if Germany and the Soviet Union go to war, the four Nordic countries will maintain neutrality in military, political, and economic terms. In other words, whether it is the supply of ore and other raw materials or the transit of various goods, equal treatment will be given to Germany and the Soviet Union. If so, Germany and the Soviet Union will at least be able to maintain a route to foreign countries. Regarding this, it is not known here whether the envoys of the four Nordic countries have discussed the matter with the Soviet diplomatic authorities. However, although the Soviet side did not express approval of this decision of the Stockholm meeting, it did not make unnecessary criticisms. (Havas, 10th)

### League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting Postponed: Opinions of Various Countries Being Solicited

(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council was originally scheduled to hold a regular meeting on the 15th of this month, with Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin taking the rotating chairmanship. It is now learned that Potemkin has just returned to the country from Eastern Europe and must report on the trip to the government of that country, so he is unable to attend. He has advocated postponing the regular meeting of the Administrative Council to the 22nd of this month. The Secretariat of the League of Nations is currently soliciting opinions from the member countries of the Administrative Council. If the member countries have no objections, the Soviet government will formally make a written request. (Havas, 11th)

(London) Regarding the Soviet government's proposal to postpone the League of Nations meeting to the 22nd, well-informed sources here recently stated that the representative of a certain country has already departed for Geneva and it would be inconvenient to wait eight days, or the postponement date may need to be shortened appropriately. Those in charge said that it would be easier to postpone the meeting to the 17th or 18th of this month. The Secretariat of the League of Nations may propose this intention to the Soviet government.

### France's Current Policy Aims to Maintain Peace: Neither Force Nor Cunning Is Desired Daladier's Determined Expression

(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies resumed this afternoon, and Premier Daladier immediately gave a speech, forcefully stating that if a certain country wants to control Europe by force, then all peace-loving countries will confront it. France's current policy is purely aimed at maintaining peace. The relationship between Britain and France is stronger than ever before. The British nation's acceptance of conscription is indeed commendable. At this time, it is truly not easy to use general agreements to guarantee peace. Other countries that are willing to cooperate with France to safeguard their vital interests can conclude local and detailed agreements as a remedy. It is hoped that all peace-loving countries will cooperate with the United States and France to defend peace. In short, France aims at peace, but only on the condition that its national rights are respected. "All violence and threats must be resisted," and various military measures have been taken and will not be reduced. If large-scale mobilization outside the country continues unabated, we must strengthen military measures. Others' attempts to "consume" our country's strength with a situation of neither war nor peace is in vain. Our attitude remains resolute and unwavering, and we will never slacken. We are not afraid of either force or cunning. (Havas, 11th)

### Pope Devoted to International Peace: Plans to Draft a Chain Letter to Be Published in All Churches

(Berlin) It was learned here today that the Pope has informed the Vatican's envoys to Berlin and other European countries that he is currently planning to draft a chain letter on peace, which will soon be read out in Catholic churches around the world. (Associated Press, 10th)

(London) The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee met this afternoon to discuss the international situation. It is reported that the cabinet members received semi-official news from Berlin suggesting that Germany could not approve of the Vatican's proposal to convene a five-power conference to discuss the Polish issue and relations between France and Italy. On the contrary, the Italian government not only approved but also encouraged it, but did not want to openly express its attitude so that the differences in opinion between Germany and Italy would not be noticed by outsiders. Regarding this matter, Britain recently stated that even if the Vatican's initiative is rejected by Germany, it is not worth regretting, because there are many difficulties in implementing the convening of the conference. Since France and Poland are unwilling for third countries to interfere in this issue, it is difficult for them to come forward and participate. However, if Germany changes its mind and accepts the Vatican's proposal, then France and Britain should still reluctantly agree. (Havas, 10th)

### Umansky Succeeds as Soviet Ambassador to the United States

(Moscow) Former Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Umansky, was appointed today as Soviet Ambassador to the United States. The previous ambassador, Troyanovsky, has been vacant for nine months since his recall. (Reuters, 11th)

### German-Italian Alliance: Contains Clauses Requiring Signatory Countries to Consult Each Other Before Taking Action

(Paris) According to news obtained from this side, the political and military clauses agreed upon by Germany and Italy contain a clause stipulating that no matter what action one of the signatory countries takes, it must consult the opinion of the other signatory country beforehand. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Milan recently focused on this clause. (Havas, 10th)

### Yugoslav Regent Attends Italian Naval Review: One Hundred Warships Engage in Offensive and Defensive Battles Political Talks Continue

(Rome) Italy is holding a naval review in Naples for Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia. One hundred warships participated, sailing out of the port into the high seas in an orderly manner. They were immediately divided into three teams, and each destroyer released smoke screens to attack. At the same time, each speedboat launched torpedoes at each cruiser. Before long, each warship lined up again and sailed to the island of Capri, using the old cruiser "San Marco" as a target, opening fire and bombing it. The cruiser was controlled by radio and soon sank after being hit. At this point, each warship advanced to the island of Ischia and was attacked by several submarines. The first act of the naval review came to an end. The Italian and Yugoslav authorities had lunch together on the cruiser "Trieste" and were scheduled to continue the review in the afternoon. (Havas, 11th)

Italian King Emmanuel III arrived in the port of Naples this morning at 9:45 a.m., accompanied by Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, to hold a naval review. Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano had already arrived earlier with South Foreign Minister Markovic. At exactly 10:00 a.m., the group boarded the cruiser "Trieste" and sailed into the Bay of Naples to begin the review, and freely conducted talks on various issues of mutual concern. It is reported that the Italian authorities explained the current location of the military and political clauses concluded between the country and Germany, and requested that Yugoslavia approach Hungary. The South authorities solemnly stated that because the country maintains good neighborliness with Romania, it must wait until Hungary and Romania restore normal relations before it can sign a non-aggression treaty with it. In addition, the two sides may have exchanged views on the matter of Italy dispatching troops to reside in Albania, but the addition of the South to the Anti-Comintern was not involved. In short, in addition to confirming the friendship clause signed between the two countries in 1937, Prince Paul's trip will not lead to the signing of any new agreements. (Havas, 11th)

### Italy Actively Expands Naval Strength: Budget Submitted to Parliament

(Rome) At today's meeting of the Fascist Professional Groups Parliament, Navy Deputy Minister General Gavarria presented the next year's naval budget and gave a speech explaining the navy's strength, stating briefly: Our navy can have the following various warships in a short period of time: (1) Four 35,000-ton battleships, (2) Four 26,000-ton battleships after renovation, (3) Nineteen giant cruisers, (4) Twelve fast cruisers, (5) Six giant destroyers, (6) Seventy torpedo boats, (7) More than one hundred submarines. Since our navy has such strong strength, when war breaks out in the future, it will be able to cope with it easily and add great threats to enemy countries. The government recently mobilized the entire fleet and dispatched warships to Albania, which has already proven that the navy's organization is free to use and extremely good, which is gratifying. (Havas, 10th)

### Germany and Japan Conduct Business Negotiations: Compromise Reached in Principle

British businessman Stanley said in the House of Commons today that the full text of the commercial treaty will be announced tomorrow. (Reuters, last day)

### Chinese Treasures Shipped to the US for Exhibition: Ancient Emperor's Throne Lost and Found Immediately

(New York) Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek of China entrusted Mrs. "Theodore Roosevelt" to display a jade pagoda and an ancient Chinese emperor's throne at the Arden Art Exhibition which opened on May 11. When they arrived here on Tuesday by the Dutch mail ship "Zaideun," only the jade pagoda was submitted to Mrs. Luo by the ship. As for the emperor's throne, it could not be found for a while. As a result, Mrs. Luo notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After two days of searching, it was found in the New York customs. It is heard that this item is priceless and worth three million US dollars. The reason why the throne could not be found for a while was because the Dutch sender mistakenly wrote the location of the recipient as California. In addition, there are other Chinese treasures to be displayed at the Arden Art Academy, including an 18th-century white jade shrine and six models of important buildings in the Forbidden City in the 18th century, and a golden lacquer throne of Emperor Qianlong. The task of exhibiting these Chinese objects is currently jointly funded by Mrs. Luo, Mrs. Clava, and Mrs. Howard. The proceeds from the exhibition will be remitted to China to be used as relief funds for civilian casualties in China. (Associated Press, 11th)

### Ten Thousand Tons of Metal: Vietnam Permits Transport to Japan

(Tokyo) According to Japanese reports, the French authorities in Annam formally notified the Japanese Consulate in Hanoi yesterday that 10,000 tons of metal ore could be temporarily transported to Japan. The report also said that the French authorities have not yet decided what policy to adopt regarding the loss of this 10,000-ton excess of metal ore. The Japanese side expects that, subject to certain restrictions in the future, it may be permitted to load this item for passage. (Associated Press, 11th)

### British Naval Commanders Discuss Adjusting Far East Defense: Meeting to Be Held in Singapore British Navy Department Says Report Not Factual

(London) According to the naval expert of the "Daily Telegraph," the commanders of the British fleets east of the Suez Canal and their staff may soon hold a meeting in Singapore so that, in the event of an emergency, the adjustment of the Far East defense policy can be in line with the times. Admiral Noble, commander of the China Fleet, and Vice Admiral Somerville, commander of the East Indies Fleet, will both attend this meeting. Rear Admiral Costain, commander of the Australian Fleet, and Vice Rear Admiral Canal, commander of the New Zealand Fleet, may also participate.

Daily Telegraph naval visitor Pai Wart learned that as a result of the Anglo-Australian negotiations, Britain has designated several warships to serve in the Pacific in case of emergency, but the number and names of the ships cannot be announced. The organization of this fleet, which will be transferred to the Far East in a certain situation, has been carefully calculated to maintain the balance of the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Although Germany and Italy are actively building ships, Britain and France can ultimately maintain their existing advantages. Now that the Singapore naval port project has been completed, Sydney has a resolution to build a large shipyard, and Malta and Gibraltar have shipyards that can accommodate extremely large battleships, so the position of the British Empire in the Far East defense has actually improved. According to the opinions of the naval community, the threat to Australian land that may have existed one or two years ago has almost disappeared, because the British warships east of the Suez Canal can form a powerful fleet in the event of war, which is already well known. (Reuters, 10th)

(London) The British Navy Department referred to the news in the "Daily Telegraph" that a naval conference will be held in Singapore soon as unfounded. (Reuters, 11th)

### From the Anniversary of the Death of the Founding Father of Poland: Talking About Danzig and the Corridor Problem

Poland, which was restored as a country from the opportunity of the Great War, has gradually attracted the world's attention. Especially recently, because of the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues, it has even been regarded as a country closely related to the Second World War. This glory of revival should undoubtedly be attributed to the great Polish national hero Marshal Józef Piłsudski, who was known for his "iron fist," but Marshal Piłsudski died of illness on this day four years ago - May 11, 1935. But his meritorious assistance, like that of Turkey's Kemal, will last forever.

Originally, Poland's geographical situation was inherently restless. It is close to Soviet Russia in the north and borders Germany in the west. There are no long rivers or high mountains. It only holds the so-called Polish Corridor to communicate with the Baltic Sea. The coastline is only 47 miles, but the Polish Corridor separates Germany and East Prussia. Because of this Polish Corridor issue, disputes arise with Germany from time to time. On the German side, of course, it must communicate with East Prussia and hope to have full authority to handle this corridor. On the Polish side, this corridor concerns the fate of the entire country and will never be abandoned. It should be known that although Germany's desire can bring 2.5 million East Prussians closer to their compatriots, it is not easy for 32 million Polish people to go to the seaside. This problem is extremely difficult to solve. At the same time, Poland uses Danzig as a free port, and on one side, it is opening up a new port of Gdynia at the mouth of the corridor, and it is also building a railway to directly connect to the port. Although the Polish Corridor problem is an extremely difficult problem to solve, it is Marshal Piłsudski who has been planning and calculating in such a difficult situation without ever losing sovereignty. Understanding this, we should know his importance to Polish life.

Marshal Józef Piłsudski was born in Lithuania in 1867. His father was a landlord. In 1863, he participated in an anti-Russian movement that failed, and the Polish people suffered even greater oppression. Piłsudski grew up in this revolutionary atmosphere. In 1875, Piłsudski studied at Vilnius Middle School and organized a secret organization to study Polish literature and history with his members. At that time, the Imperial Russian government wanted to Russify the Polish people, and Piłsudski and his members' actions were prohibited by the school authorities. In 1885, Piłsudski entered the Faculty of Medicine of Kharkov University and began to recognize the secret organization of Polish youth, and soon he was elected as the leader of the organization and was rejected by the school. Piłsudski continued to be active among young students, and when the opportunity was leaked, he was arrested. In 1887, he was sentenced to five years of exile and exiled to Siberia.

### President Kong Discusses the War Situation and Its Future: Japan is Already in an Irreversible Situation; China's Victory in the War of Resistance is Beginning to Emerge

Chongqing Air Mail: A reporter recently visited President of the Executive Yuan, Kong Xiangxi, to inquire about his views on the current war situation and future prospects. Kong provided detailed answers, which are recorded as follows:

Striving for Survival

Our war of resistance against Japan is not only for the independence and survival of our nation, but also to uphold human justice and peace. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's aggression against us has intensified daily. In order to avoid the devastation of innocent lives, the government has repeatedly made concessions, enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese militarists even mobilized their forces to invade our inland, attempting to destroy our country and conquer our nation by force. The government, having completely lost hope for peace and reaching the final moment of sacrifice, accepted the demands of the people nationwide and resolutely rose up to resist. This is truly our legitimate right to seek survival and self-defense, a last resort. The purity of our motive and the bitterness of our suffering are recognized worldwide.

The Military Situation

Since the outbreak of the war, although the front lines have changed repeatedly, the morale of the army and the spirit of the people have grown stronger day by day. Although the loss of life and property has been extremely severe, there have been no complaints. Moreover, due to the enemy's burning, killing, and looting, the people have risen up in armed self-defense, cooperating with the regular army to strike at the enemy everywhere. This widespread and numerous popular movement, along with the reorganization of the army and the replenishment of equipment, has strengthened our military power, causing the enemy to become more and more bogged down. The Japanese militarists, relying on their superior military equipment, have ventured deep into our territory, making a desperate gamble, hoping for a quick victory and a quick conclusion. However, after nearly two years of fighting, they have achieved nothing, and their own strength has been greatly weakened. Replacements have become increasingly difficult. Recently, within the enemy's country and various units, anti-war sentiment has become increasingly strong, morale has declined, and the army's morale has been shattered, showing signs of an irreversible situation. This is an especially serious threat to the enemy.

The Economic Situation

From an economic point of view, Japan is a highly industrialized country, and during wartime, material mobilization is certainly more convenient, but collapse is also the most rapid. Currently, many factories in the enemy's country have been converted into ordnance factories, unable to engage in active production. Moreover, due to the enemy's brutal acts, they have aroused the universal indignation of the world's people, and the movement to boycott Japanese goods is surging. The stagnant sales of domestic public bonds, soaring prices, and the depletion of reserves further demonstrate that it is collapsing at an accelerating rate. Our country is an agricultural country, with a vast land and abundant resources, and large-scale production can be pursued anywhere. In the short term, the utilization of materials may not be fully utilized, but in the long-term war of resistance, we can still make progress. In addition, over a year of arduous war of resistance has aroused the widespread sympathy of friendly countries, and international economic assistance is flowing in. The recent establishment of loans from friendly countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Belgium is clear evidence of this, which is beyond the reach of the enemy.

International Sympathy

In addition to economic assistance, international sympathy and assistance for us also has a positive impact in terms of moral support. For example, the League of Nations passed a resolution invoking Articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant, and the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have successively sent notes to Japan, condemning its aggression. Recently, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the US Senate, proposed authorizing the President to decide on commercial restrictions on Japan. All of these tangible and intangible, direct and indirect, assistance given to us is considerable. The Japanese militarists have driven millions of troops to carry out aggression, and our people have certainly suffered from their poison, but the domestic, international, political, and economic difficulties they have created for themselves are almost insurmountable. After the failure of the war in the future, not only will the national strength accumulated since the Meiji Restoration be exhausted, but they will also acquire a reputation for aggression. As a result, inhuman creatures will not know how to establish a foothold in the universe. Therefore, enemy warlords are not only our enemies, but also criminals against the Japanese nation and country.

Enduring Pain for a Time

What all our compatriots throughout the country should pay attention to at this moment is how to endure pain for a time in order to seek permanent freedom and happiness. It must be understood that "people must insult themselves before others insult them, and a country must attack itself before others attack it." The outrageous aggression we are suffering today is partly due to the bad causes we planted in the past, resulting in us eating our own bitter fruit. If we want to wash away the humiliation and seek survival, the whole country must be vigilant, diligent, and hardworking, exhausting our individual resources and doing our utmost to contribute to the country. Before the European War, the people of France, Belgium, and Germany, among other countries, always had two meat dishes in their three-course meals. After the outbreak of the European War, they mostly ate vegetarian or less food. Now, although the European War has ended for twenty years, the German people still eat meat only every few days. This is something our compatriots should learn from. Recently, Chairman Chiang promoted the National Spiritual Mobilization, the purpose of which is to awaken the public's awareness, to overcome all difficulties with perseverance, to be inspired to achieve something, to constantly improve ourselves, and to achieve the goal of winning the war of resistance and building the country. This is something we should always strive to follow.

The True Meaning of the War of Resistance

Now, the victory of the war of resistance is beginning to emerge. What we seek is the permanent, glorious peace of mankind. However, surrender and peace negotiations are actually incomplete, shaking the national policy, only making the enemy happy and the loved ones sad. From ancient times to the present, at home and abroad, there has never been a permanent state of discord. However, the way to achieve peace must be based on the principles of national independence and national independence as the supreme principles. No individual should be allowed to act arbitrarily, resulting in the loss of sovereignty and humiliation of the country, leading to self-destruction. This is the true meaning of the war of resistance. The people of the country should be able to distinguish right from wrong, know what to choose and what to abandon, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of victory. (May 1)

### Finance After the Establishment of Xikang Province (Continued): Shortage of Income Insufficient for Administrative and Construction Expenses; Entirely Dependent on Assistance from Sichuan Provincial Government and Subsidies from the Central Government

Chairman Wen Hui of Xikang Provincial Government, in view of the financial difficulties of Xikang, believes that the problem of demarcation must be resolved. Xikang can only have the qualifications of a province in terms of objective conditions, and then the establishment of the province can be realized. Last year, he went to Chongqing and flew to Hankou many times, repeatedly arguing with the central authorities on everything. Until winter, the problem of demarcation was finally resolved. However, the Liangya Region (excluding Mingshan)划入 from the Sichuan border area has a total of fourteen counties and two administrative bureaus, with an annual grain quota of only more than 90,700 yuan. Together with other tax revenues, the annual total is only tens of thousands of yuan (according to the Sichuan Provincial Finance Department's 26th annual grain quota list for each county). The administrative security expenses expenditure differs very greatly. The only thing that maintains and carries out is the monthly administrative expenses subsidy of 30,000 yuan from the Sichuan Provincial Government. As for the administrative and business expenses of the provincial government itself, the pre-establishment committee drafted a budget of 4,080,000 yuan for the 28th year. In addition to the income of more than 900,000 yuan from the counties under Kang, and the original subsidies from the central government and assistance from neighboring provinces, the central government increased the subsidy of 1,260,000 yuan for the 28th year, with an average of 100,500 yuan per month. In addition to the political expenses, this amount is used for construction expenses. However, if the Xikang develops its own large-scale businesses, it still feels insufficient and can only adopt gradualism. As for the major ends of mining, road construction, river dredging, and immigration in the Ning and Ya regions, they are all the responsibility of the central government. According to the survey, the annual land tax and miscellaneous tax revenue of each county and bureau in Xikang Province are as follows: Land tax revenue: Kangding 955.575 yuan, Luding 73.039 yuan, Zhanhua 920.371 yuan, Derong 801.662 yuan, Lihua 838.359 yuan, Baiyu 657.135 yuan, Jiulong 430.844 yuan, Danba 764.396 yuan, Ganzi 2,622.344 yuan, Luhuo 1,319.357 yuan, Daofu 763.259 yuan, Yajiang 370.321 yuan, Dingxiang 2,2000.000 yuan, Daocheng 1,525.837 yuan, Dengke 645.600 yuan, Dege 887.200 yuan, Baan 2,855.763 yuan, Yaan 29.922.11 yuan, Hanyuan 1,928.39 yuan, Tianquan 2,713.54 yuan, Rongjing 3,593.61 yuan, Baoxing 2,210.49 yuan, Lushan 5,858.9 yuan, Jintang Administrative Bureau 969.50 yuan, Xichang 48,000.00 yuan, Yuejun 7.360.10 yuan, Huili 9.700.00 yuan, Mianning 13.259.18 yuan, Yanyuan 7.261.60 yuan, Yanbian 243.44 yuan, Nanning 1.177.88 yuan, Zhaojue and Ningdong Administrative Bureau did not raise taxes, totaling 153.478.293 yuan. Miscellaneous tax revenue: Kangding 5.017.097 yuan, Luding 3.070.286 yuan, Zhanhua 4.214.560 yuan, Derong nil, Lihua 5.211.560 yuan, Baiyu 3.765.216 yuan, Jiulong 982.050. yuan, Danba 654.560 yuan, Ganzi 3.797.480 yuan, Luhuo 1.607.914 yuan, Daofu 657.056 yuan, Yajiang 527.800 yuan, Dingxiang 75.650 yuan, Daocheng 847.500 yuan, Dengshu 6.367.014 yuan, Dege 5.325.300 yuan, Baan 1.221.350 yuan, Shiqu 13.245.410 yuan, Yaan 21.225.70 yuan, Hanyuan 16.178.60 yuan, Tianquan 5.231.20 yuan, Rongjing 9.897.00 yuan, Baoxing 120.00 yuan, Lushan 3.328.00 yuan, Jintang Administrative Bureau 240.00 yuan, Xichang 34.558.00 yuan, Yuejun 13.495.00 yuan, Huili 51.868.00 yuan, Mianning 18.620.00 yuan, Yanyuan 13.239.00 yuan, Yanbian 2.652.00 yuan, Nanning 8.374.00 yuan, totaling 255.614.203 yuan.

The total tax revenue of the whole of Kang is 409.092.496 yuan. (End)

### Chinese Military Administration Department Controls Danyang; Also Liaises with Mei Jiasheng's Department

Danyang Correspondence: The Japanese garrison entrenched in Danyang City has repeatedly engaged in seesaw battles with the Chinese Military Administration Department, led by Guan Wenwei. The Japanese, realizing their unfavorable terrain, had to retreat to the city. In order to consolidate the rear defense, the Administration Department has deployed its troops to advance towards the Danyang-Zhenjiang area, and in conjunction with the Chinese army led by Mei Jiasheng in the Zhencheng Highway area, they launched a pincer attack on the Japanese army stationed in the Picheng and Jianbi sections. After five or six hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was caught off guard, suffering nearly a hundred casualties. Forty or fifty Chinese soldiers also bravely sacrificed themselves. One Japanese military vehicle was burned on the spot, and more than ten rifles were seized. All bridges along the highway were destroyed before retreating. When a large number of Japanese reinforcements arrived by military vehicle, the Chinese army had vanished. In order to vent their anger, the Japanese army set fire to villages and houses in the area, and arrested dozens of innocent villagers.

### Overview of China's International Cultural Cooperation Undertakings: Participation in International Academic Conferences; Exchange of Students and Publications

(Chongqing Special Dispatch) China's participation in the international cultural undertakings of the League of Nations dates back to 1930. Recently, the League of Nations launched a revision of the International Convention on Cultural Cooperation to further strengthen cultural cooperation between countries. The League of Nations obtained China's consent and requested Li Shizeng to represent China in formally signing the convention in Paris in December 1938. After the signing of this convention, the exchange of cultural undertakings and information between the member states is more convenient, which is particularly beneficial to China. The Ministry of Education's past international cultural cooperation matters are described below:

Participation in International Academic Conferences

Before the War of Resistance, the important international academic conferences that China participated in included the International Conference on Public Education, the International Congress of Art History, the International Dialect Conference, the General Assembly of the International Committee on Cultural Cooperation, the International Religious Conference, and the French Xiangkaier Conference. After attending the conferences, the representatives submitted written reports, which were forwarded by the Ministry of Education to relevant institutions and groups for reference. During the War of Resistance, external publicity was very important. China participated in a total of seven international academic conferences: In June 1938, the 13th International Congress for the Protection of Children in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was attended by Xu Ze, Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Germany; In June of the same year, the International Conference on Philosophy, Science and General Culture in Mexico was attended by a staff member of the Chinese Embassy in Mexico; In July of the same year, the Seventh International Conference on Education in Geneva was attended by Xie Shou Kang; In July of the same year, the International Conference on Technical Education in Berlin was attended by Xie Shou Kang; In August of the same year, the Second World Youth Congress in New York, USA, was attended by a Chinese delegation of 29 people; In August of the same year, the Eighth International Congress of Historical Sciences in Switzerland was attended by Hu Shi; In September of the same year, the 20th World Congress of Oriental Studies in Beijing was attended by Xie Shou Kang.

Selection and Exchange of Students

In the spring of 1936, the Polish government requested the Chinese government to select a student to study in Poland. The Polish government paid for tuition and accommodation, and the Ministry of Education paid for round-trip travel expenses. This was accepted, and Fang Fusen, assistant teacher of the School of Engineering of Tsinghua University, was selected to study road engineering and will soon complete his studies and return to serve the country. In 1937, at the request of the German International Academic Exchange Office, the Ministry of Education decided to jointly organize the exchange of students between China and Germany with the Office. In the first year, it was decided to exchange six students first. The exchange schools in China were Central, Beijing, Wuhan, Jiaotong, and other universities, and Shanghai Medical College. In Germany, the International Academic Exchange Office was responsible for the matter. After the exchange of students between the two countries was approved, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, affecting the opening dates of various schools. It was requested that German students coming to China postpone their departure, and only two Chinese students went to Germany. In addition, Italy also requested to exchange students with China. In 1936, a student was selected to study in Italy, but the Italian side has not yet selected students to come to China.

Establishment of International Cultural Organizations

In order to communicate cultural relations between China and foreign countries, the Ministry of Education has successively approved the establishment of Sino-British, Sino-Polish, Sino-German, Sino-Soviet and other cultural associations organized by Chinese and foreign academics, and provided guidance and supervision at any time. The important work of each association over the years: the Sino-American Cultural Association, such as the selection of interns from the American Industrial Federation, the exchange of Sino-British lectures; the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, such as the publication of Sino-Soviet culture and other publications, the holding of film exhibitions and art exhibitions, and the establishment of the Soviet Research Committee; the Sino-Polish and Sino-German Cultural Associations, such as the exchange of students, and the publication of introductions. Not only is it sufficient to promote cultural ties between the two countries, but it also benefits the friendship between the two countries. In addition, Chinese academic circles, in order to uphold the purpose and policies of the League of Nations, the League of Nations Comrades Association, which was formerly established in Peiping, also moved south in the winter of 1935, improved its organization, and continued to carry out its work. In the past two years, the Association has been actively engaged in upholding the League of Nations, and has achieved considerable results.

Exchange of International Publications

China officially joined the International Convention on the Exchange of Publications in 1925, which is now handled by the International Exchange Office of Publications of the Ministry of Education. In 1936, 36 countries joined the exchange agreement. In 1937, three more countries, Queensland, Latvia, and El Salvador, were added, totaling 39 countries. There are also dozens of unofficial exchange countries that distribute publications through the Office, including Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and their territories. In the two years before the war, the Office transferred the following quantities of domestic and foreign exchange items: Received 246 boxes and 237 packages of books transferred by various countries to domestic institutions; Received 73 boxes and 16,729 packages of books and documents transferred by domestic institutions to various countries; Distributed 113 boxes and 859 packages of books and documents to various countries; Distributed 111 boxes and 5,600 packages of books and documents to domestic institutions. In addition, during the War of Resistance, the Office transferred the following quantities of domestic and foreign exchange items: Received 17 boxes and 28 packages of documents transferred by various countries to domestic institutions; Sent out 538 packages of documents to foreign institutions; Received a total of 4 boxes and 10 packages of documents transferred by domestic institutions to various countries; Sent out a total of 3 boxes and 1,560 packages of documents to foreign institutions. In addition, the China College of the University of Frankfurt in Germany is still subsidized by China with regular expenses of 5,000 yuan per year. The International University of India has also established a China College with the support of China. In the future, if the funding for international cultural undertakings can be increased, China's cultural cooperation undertakings with various countries can be gradually promoted. As for China's hosting of the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London, which enabled European and American people to have a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and enhanced China's international status, the details of the meeting were reported in detail in this newspaper before the war, and will not be repeated here.

### The Ministry of Education Begins Editing Textbooks: Chinese Language, History, and Geography

(Chongqing Correspondence) Since the new president of the National Tongji University, Zhao Shiqing, took office, the faculty and staff of the school, Liang Zhiyan, Yang Shangheng, Wu Zhihan, etc., have often contributed their opinions to him. On the one hand, they are building a fixed campus, and on the other hand, they are actively enriching the content to make up for the losses suffered in recent years due to the war. It is said that Zhao Jun fully accepted these opinions and expressed his willingness to pay attention to the spiritual training of students.

### Davis Cup Second Week Competition: China Has Strong Hopes; Two Young French Players Have Enlisted; Military Refuses to Grant Leave to Attend the Competition

(Paris, 10th Associated Press) The Davis Cup European Zone Second Week Competition, China and France, has been scheduled to fight at the Loren Gales Stadium in Paris on May 19, 20, and 21. The Chinese representatives Xu Jiji and Cai Huiquan, in view of their excellent performance in the All England Hard Court Championships, China is very likely to eliminate the French team and enter the third week. The French Tennis Association, in order to strengthen its strength, has disregarded the military's opposition and selected the young players Beitora and Berichai, who were recently drafted into the army and sent to the French-Spanish border, as representatives, plus the veteran Pusais and Taistramo, and the veteran Brunon, one of the famous three musketeers, as the non-competing captain. The military and the Tennis Association have had considerable conflicts of opinion as a result. Not only did the military not allow Beiwala and Berichai to take leave for the Davis Cup competition, but they also refused to grant short-term leave to go to Paris. Until recently, the military has not changed its attitude. Therefore, France's hope of winning the Davis Cup has been greatly weakened. If Bela Thoth and Berichai cannot attend the competition at the time, France is likely to be eliminated by China.

They participated in the Shanghai Athletics Games, organized annually by the Shanghai International Athletics Association, under the name of the Shanghai Athletics Team. At that time, they were fortunate to receive material and spiritual assistance from enthusiastic sports enthusiasts, preserving a glimmer of hope for Chinese sports in the isolated island. This year, Mr. Zhou and others have continued to uphold their original aspirations, continuing to operate this track and field organization, and renaming it the Hua Lian Track and Field Association, registering to participate in this year's international track and field competitions, maintaining the old international status of Chinese sports. Since the organization committee was established, they have been working separately, actively handling various association affairs. Now, after the second committee meeting, it has been decided to expand the organization into a permanent organization, named the Hua Lian Track and Field Association, and to appoint Zhou Bangjun, who is enthusiastic about promoting social undertakings, as the president, and Yu Shunmao, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and others as advisors. Mr. Zhou has readily agreed to serve as president and preside over the association affairs.

### Finland's Ambition for the World Games, Hiring a Large Number of Foreign Coaches for Active Training

### Proclamation by the Authorities of the Two Concessions: No Protection for Political Activities; Aimed at Maintaining Neutrality and Protecting Residents; Curfew Rules Will Also Be Strictly Revised

British Member of Parliament Urges Government to Pay Attention to the Situation Outside the Shanghai Concessions

The Shanghai Public Concession Board of Works and the French Concession Directorate issued a joint proclamation yesterday, stating that since the outbreak of the war, the authorities of the French Concession and the Public Concession have always done their best to maintain neutrality within their respective jurisdictions so that law-abiding residents can safely continue to operate their businesses and that the lives and property of all persons, regardless of nationality, can be protected. Although activities of a political nature are regarded by the participants as acts of patriotism, the respect for the neutral zone is purely due to the fact that it is managed by foreign authorities. By law, the aforementioned activities cannot be carried out in these areas, and political organizations cannot be allowed to operate in the two concessions. Otherwise, it would be contrary to the aim of the two concession authorities to strive to maintain neutrality for the benefit of all residents. It is hereby proclaimed that henceforth, anyone who directly or indirectly participates in such organizations will not be protected by the two concessions and may even be deported. In order to maintain law and order, the two concession authorities will immediately take any necessary measures when they deem it necessary, without further notice. The curfew rules will be strictly revised and promulgated at any time as needed and will be implemented immediately. Any person who, at this time, commits an act that endangers peace, order, and good governance will be severely punished by the two concessions within the scope of their authority. This proclamation is issued on the 11th day of May, 1939.

Disorder in the Suburbs of Shanghai

Reuters, London, 10th: Conservative MP Haslam asked in the House of Commons today whether the government would draw the attention of the Japanese government to the fact that the Shanghai Municipal Council found it difficult to maintain law and order in the Public Concession due to the chaos and lawlessness in the area occupied by the Japanese army on Sunday. Foreign Secretary Butler replied in writing that the British side had asked the Japanese authorities to pay attention to this difficulty.

Havas, London, 10th: At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Conservative MP Sir Haslam raised an inquiry, saying that the order outside the Shanghai Public Concession was chaotic, the law was gone, and the Concession authorities felt it difficult to maintain law and order. He asked whether Prime Minister Chamberlain planned to make representations to the Japanese government to draw attention to it. Foreign Secretary Butler replied immediately that the Japanese authorities had already been alerted to this difficulty.

### Situation of Meeting with the Press

Mainland Daily reported that a meeting was held in the Municipal Council Building yesterday (10th) morning, chaired by the Director-General Frankling, and that foreign publishers of Chinese newspapers guaranteed to fully cooperate with the Municipal Council and to cautiously publish political articles involving the Sino-Japanese War. Frankling explained in detail the attitude of the Municipal Council and repeatedly made clear to the publishers and editors-in-chief of various foreign-run Chinese newspapers that the Municipal Council was not demanding but asking for cooperation. Dr. Ferguson gave assurances on behalf of his colleagues. Police Chief Bowen and Municipal Council Director-General Philip also attended the meeting. It was said that the peace and order in the Municipal Council area depended on the cooperation of the newspapers. The purpose of the meeting was to ask the newspapers to assist and cooperate, and it was added that the policy of the Municipal Council was only to protect

Life and Property

in the Public Concession. It was also said that the Municipal Council had made the greatest efforts to maintain neutrality, and it still is. The current situation in the Public Concession made the Municipal Council feel that it had to request the cautious publication of political news involving the Sino-Japanese War. This request was not intended to implement censorship but only to seek assistance that would be most beneficial to the general public, and this measure was temporary in nature but would be

Very Helpful

for maintaining the state of the Public Concession.

One foreign publisher wanted to know more details, mentioning that US Ambassador to China Johnson had recently delivered a radio address in San Francisco, involving the political situation and the war in China, and asked whether such articles should also be submitted to the Special Branch of the Police Department before publication. Frankling replied that such articles, if published verbatim, without editorials, did not need to be submitted to the Police Department, but

Attached Comments

should be submitted to the Special Branch first. Another publisher asked about the Municipal Council's attitude towards Japanese newspapers and whether these newspapers could freely criticize the political situation here. Frankling replied that there were very few of these newspapers sold south of the Suzhou River, and since their sales were limited to what the Japanese considered military

Occupation Area

Frankling implied that the Municipal Council had no power to act against them. Dr. Ferguson replied on behalf of the foreign publishers present that all publications were opposed to any demands, but the publishers also knew the situation and guaranteed full cooperation on behalf of their colleagues.

### Five Chinese Kidnapped; Detained by Japanese Military Police; Japanese Authorities Remain Silent on the Matter; Japanese Newspapers Praise it Extensively

The English-language Great American Evening News reported that on Tuesday afternoon, personnel from the Japanese Special Affairs Department arrested five Chinese men without notifying the Public Concession Police Department at the Fu Lai Jewish Curry Restaurant at 159 Guangxi Road. It was learned today (11th) that the Japanese had arrested these five Chinese men on suspicion that they were secretly plotting to launch a wide-ranging guerrilla campaign in Baoshan and Wusong, which are the bases of the Japanese army and navy. They were taken in three cars with

Shanghai Garrison

passes and taken to Hongkou. It is said that they have been detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters and are being closely interrogated about their activities. It is now confirmed that the five arrested men are Hong Guanghua, Executive Committee Member of the Baoshan County Party; Wu Yiqing, who formerly worked in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters (not Wu Chuiying, but Mr. Wu has also disappeared); Su Liangru, Chief of Staff of the Baoshan Guerrilla;

Baoshan County Magistrate

Chen Jiamo, appointed by Chongqing; and Jiang Hao, Shanghai New Life Instructor. Four of them were arrested in the first batch, and the fifth person was caught twenty minutes later and also arrested. The Japanese authorities are clearly willing to remain silent on this matter, but Japanese newspapers have praised the excellent work of the army's Special Affairs Department in arresting one of Shanghai's "main anti-Japanese elements."

Another Report

stated that at 12:20 PM on the 9th of this month, more than ten armed plainclothes Japanese and two Chinese suddenly arrived at the Fu Lai Jewish Curry Restaurant at 159 Guangxi Road, driving three white-牌 cars with Shanghai Garrison passes.

Where Were They Taken

And the reason for the arrest is still unknown. However, one of the five arrested Chinese, Jiang Hao, was formerly an instructor of the New Life Movement in Shanghai; Wu Chuiying, who had served locally before the war, opened a

Joint Venture

Yi Da Feng Rice Shop in Shanzhong Road for the sake of his family's livelihood after his hometown was occupied on August 13th, and also operated a silk reeling business in Kangnuot Road in West Shanghai, making a small profit to support his life; Hong Guanghua, now operates the Yuanlong Shipping Company in the Pudong Bank Building on Avenue Edward VII; the other two are said to be Su Liangru and Chen Jiamo.

### Registration of Stored Rice Begins in the Market; Evaluation and Implementation of Rice Prices; Four People, Including Fu Qian Geng, Appointed to Be Responsible; Registration of Stored Rice Begins Immediately

The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee, in order to effectively implement price limits, convened an extraordinary committee meeting the day before yesterday, resolving to appoint committee members to evaluate prices daily and deciding to begin registering owners of stored rice today. Merchants are flocking to transport rice from the production areas, and after the sources have been dredged, the rice prices in the Shanghai market have stabilized. Details are recorded as follows:

Appointing Committee Members to Evaluate Rice Prices

In addition to strictly implementing the price limits set by the Rice Evaluation Committee, the Bean and Rice Market Management Committee held an extraordinary committee meeting at the market at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, chaired by Fu Qian Geng. Regarding the issue of how to implement the secondary price limits, after discussion, the committee appointed four people, including Fu Qian Geng, to evaluate the prices of early rice under the river daily and then sell it. This method will be implemented from today, so the market order will be more peaceful from now on.

Registration of Stored Rice Begins Immediately

After the Rice Evaluation Committee resolved to register the owners of stored rice, it immediately began to proceed. It was decided to start the registration today, with a deadline of one week until the 18th. All owners of stored rice can fill out the form and register at the Bean and Rice Industry Association at 15 Avenue Edward VII, including: (1) Account name, (2) Name or trademark of the owner, (3) Address of the owner, (4) Date of registration, (5) Name of the warehouse, (6) Address of the warehouse, (7) Type of stored rice, (8) Quantity of stored rice, (9) Remarks, (10) Seal of the owner.

Dredging Sources to Stabilize Rice Prices

Previously, merchants transporting goods were reluctant to move forward because various rice-producing areas restricted exports and imposed petty taxes, resulting in many losses, which led to a shortage of rice sources. Later, after the Rice Evaluation Committee strongly urged them to take the overall situation into account and purchase as much as possible, according to the New Voice News Agency reporter, merchants transporting goods have been purchasing in the production areas in order to stabilize rice prices and encourage each other to take the food of Shanghai citizens as the premise and decide to continue purchasing. According to the rice industry, the amount of rice arriving in recent days has increased slightly compared to the past, and large quantities are still being purchased and will be transported continuously.

Chamber of Commerce Responds Approving Filing

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce disturbed the Bean and Rice Industry Association's letter to the Chamber of Commerce, convening rice industry groups, resolving to re-regulate the maximum price limit and establishing penalty rules. Please check and file the situation. After consideration by the Chamber, it was considered that the statement was true, and the Bean and Rice Industry Association was replied to allow the filing.

Bureau Discusses Rice Industry Proposal

The Evaluation Committee, held on the 9th of this month, resolved to recommend that the two concession authorities find ways to store and purchase rice. Room No. 4 on the second floor of the hotel arrested five Chinese people. The situation has been reported in the newspapers. Now, the five Chinese people, whether they are foreign rice or domestic rice, must order and store them, and provide timely assistance to the food of the Shanghai people. It is now known that the committee has written to the authorities, and after receiving a reply, it will consider the opinions of the authorities before discussing in detail whether to carry out subsidized rice sales or average distribution to rice shops according to the methods at the end of last year. It is heard that the Shanghai rice industry incident will also be submitted for discussion at the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Public Concession Board of Works on Tuesday, the 16th of this month. Regarding the requests of various rice industry groups: (1) sending members to participate in the organization of the Evaluation Committee, (2) ordering foreign rice, etc., will also be submitted to the Board of Directors for discussion after receiving the letter. It is heard that the authorities have drafted effective measures to address the various conditions of the Shanghai rice market and will remain silent until a decision has been made at the meeting. Regarding the case of re-limiting the price of rice for filing, the letter has been translated into English and is currently being studied.

### Japanese Consul General Miura Returns Home to Report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Recent Situation in Shanghai

It is reported that Miura's trip is to report everything to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### Ningbo Bombed for the Sixth Time; Six Japanese Planes Ravaged Again the Day Before Yesterday; The Ningbo Fellow Association Is Still Trying to Provide Relief

Ningbo was bombed for the sixth time at 9:00 AM on the 10th by six Japanese planes. The Japanese planes invaded the Ningbo area, circled several times, and then flew to the Jiangdong District to bomb, dropping a total of 15 bombs. The Ningbo Chuan Automobile Company garage on Dahe Road suffered the heaviest losses, with 12 bombs hitting it. The other three bombs fell on Zhangbin Bridge, a residential building on Dahe Road, and the Di Mu Temple. After the incident, an investigation of the damage revealed that in addition to the Ningbo Chuan Company garage being completely destroyed, more than 40 houses were destroyed, and one civilian was injured in the bombing. The Ningbo Fellow Association, concerned about its hometown, had previously hired doctors and nurses, as well as medical supplies, and chartered the De Ping ship to carry them to Ningbo. However, the ship was obstructed and returned to Shanghai halfway. The De Ping ship is still moored at the floating pontoon No. 20 in Yangshupu, and the medicines on board have not yet been retrieved. However, the association, concerned about its hometown, has not given up its aspiration to provide relief to its fellow villagers and is currently examining the situation to determine its next course of action.

### Ende Ship Returns to Shanghai; Hanna Ship Sets Sail

The Shanghai-Dinghai route, the German Far East Company's Hanna ship, was originally scheduled to set sail from Shanghai for the second time on the 8th of this month. However, the Dinghai authorities imposed very strict restrictions on passengers and cargo, resulting in a lack of business prospects. Now, with the permission of the Ningbo Garrison Commander and the understanding of the Dinghai authorities, it is planned to load cargo and passengers as usual at 4:00 PM today and set sail. The Italian China Company's Ende ship, which had been sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou, has not yet returned to Shanghai after a week. According to company news yesterday, the ship is scheduled to leave Wenzhou in the morning and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. In addition, the Mofuku and Baoli ships will return to Shanghai as soon as passengers and cargo have been unloaded.

### Gas Price Increase Continues; Surcharge to Continue; Approved by the Board of Works; Additional Surcharge Will Be Added Starting in June

The British Shanghai Gas Company had previously increased the gas surcharge from 18% to 23% from February 15th to April 30th due to soaring coal prices. Now, the company has applied to the Board of Works to allow the gas surcharge sold in May to continue to be charged at 23%, and to add an additional surcharge from June 1st to the end of August. The Board of Works Public Services Committee has approved it and the Board of Directors has approved it on May 3rd. Therefore, the company notified users yesterday that the gas surcharge for this month will continue to be charged at 23%.

### National Government Concerned About Shanghai Refugees; Continues to Remit 200,000 Yuan in Relief Funds; Sends Commissioner Mao to Shanghai for Inspection; Expresses Satisfaction with Relief Work

Chairman Kong, Deputy Chairman Xu, Deputy Chairman Qu, and Standing Committee Members Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Qinglan, Huang Bodu, and Chen Fangxian of the Relief Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek that refugees should be given the same importance as soldiers, have been providing extensive relief to refugees throughout the country, sparing no effort. Although Shanghai is surrounded by the occupied area, forming an isolated island, the National Government is still properly planning relief for the Shanghai refugees at all times. Last year, in addition to sending personnel to Shanghai, Deputy Chairman Xu asked leaders from all walks of life to mobilize the people of Shanghai and work with the National Government to jointly relieve the Shanghai refugees. Because Mr. Yu Qiaqing went to Hong Kong, Deputy Chairman Xu flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong to meet with Standing Committee Members Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai, personally asking Mr. Yu to return to Shanghai to preside over the planning and organization of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. On the day the Association was established, he remitted 100,000 yuan to express his support for the enthusiasm of Chinese and foreign leaders to jointly provide relief and the kindness of the National Government in not forgetting the Shanghai refugees. Currently, all sectors of Shanghai society are enthusiastically paying donations to the Association, and all refugee provisions are allocated by the Association, so there are no concerns. However, the central government's concern is still very deep. Recently, an additional 200,000 yuan in relief funds was remitted to Shanghai, and Commissioner Mao Heyuan was sent to inspect in person and convey condolences to the leaders of various charitable organizations. It is reported that Commissioner Mao expressed great satisfaction with the Shanghai relief work and has now completed his official duties and left Shanghai. All sectors of society, upon hearing the news that the National Government is still remitting funds to Shanghai at this difficult time of resistance, are grateful for its benevolence and believe that it is their inescapable duty to donate and relieve the suffering.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Mokanshan; US Consulate to Protest; Believed to Endanger American Property and Lives of American Nationals; Shanghai Municipal Council Sanatorium Suffers 40,000 Gold Damage

The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 10th), reliable sources indicated that Japanese planes bombed Mokanshan, a summer resort in Zhejiang Province, on Friday morning. It is anticipated that the American Consulate in Shanghai will soon lodge a protest, declaring that such air raids endanger American property and the lives of American nationals. Currently, the American authorities are still investigating the matter and continuing to gather intelligence.

Yesterday, a thoughtful letter was received from Mr. Noothout, the only foreigner on the mountain. The letter stated that during the attack, ten to twelve bombs were dropped, causing significant property damage. Among the buildings hit by the bombs was the Shanghai Municipal Council's sanatorium, comprising four bungalows, valued at 42,000 yuan. Whether the Shanghai Municipal Council will

lodge a protest

was not yet confirmed yesterday. It is reported that three of the bungalows had been built for many years, while one had been completed in less than ten years. The sanatorium was originally intended solely for Municipal Council employees to recuperate after illness, but recently any employee could use it for short vacations. It can accommodate thirty to forty people. Mr. Noothout's letter also mentioned that several men, women, and children were injured during the air raid. It was generally believed yesterday that there were no doctors on the mountain, but this could not be confirmed. It is rumored that there is

one nurse

and some medicine left on the mountain. Mr. Noothout's letter did not specify the motive for the air raid, but stated that there were no Chinese military or political activities in the resort at the time. Both the letter and telegram from Mr. Noothout arrived late. The air raid occurred last Friday, not last Sunday as previously thought, because Mr. Noothout instructed a coolie to go to Xiaofeng in the southern Chinese area of Shanxi

to send a telegram.

The coolie was on the road for two days, so the telegram sent on the 5th of this month was only sent on the 7th. The letter mailed from Huzhou arrived yesterday. Currently, there are 2,000 refugees on Mokanshan, mostly women and children. Mr. Noothout is currently assisting in caring for them there.

### Mr. Goniche, Western Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Resigns

### A Glimpse of the Emptiness of the Japanese Puppet Army; After Being Severely Wounded by Zhang Huifang's Troops, No Reinforcements Arrived for Two Weeks

Since Zhang Huifang's troops of the Chinese Guerrilla Brigade in Chuansha County, Pudong, engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese puppet army at the Xujialukou intersection on the 16th of last month, it is reported that the Japanese puppet army suffered heavy casualties. At the time, their remaining forces numbered only thirty to forty men, so they urgently sought assistance, hoping to invade again. However, the Japanese puppet army had no troops to spare and could not cope. Therefore, for more than twenty days, not a single soldier or troop arrived. The guerrillas understood the situation and intensified their attacks. The Japanese puppet army panicked and repeatedly called for help. It wasn't until the day before yesterday that sixty or so Japanese puppet soldiers passed through the suburbs and headed towards Bailonggang. Therefore, it is anticipated that battles will occur again within days.

### Wing On Musical Society Cantonese Opera Raises Funds; Unprecedented Spectacle; General Manager Kwok Personally Stars; Vice Chairman Kwok Delivers Opening Speech

Mr. Fung Ping-nam, Chairman of the Guangdong Association in Shanghai Relief Fund Raising Committee for Guangdong Refugees, was unable to attend due to illness, so Mr. Kwok Chung-leung, the Vice Chairman of the association, delivered the opening speech on his behalf, expressing his gratitude for the efforts of the members of the Wing On Musical Society and the generosity of the audience, and hoping that benevolent people from all walks of life will be inspired and alleviate the suffering of compatriots who are suffering from disasters everywhere.

### Fresh Meat Business in Both Concessions Forced to Suspend Business; Resolved Not to Close Doors to Show Forced Market Shutdown; Employees Stay in Stores and Are Not Allowed to Go Out

The fresh pork business in Shanghai transported from Jiangbei has been repeatedly illegally plundered by the "Hongkou Livestock Market." The trade association of the industry adheres to its position, vowing not to give in, and is willing to sacrifice business, quietly waiting for the authorities of the concessions to handle the aftermath. Now, the entire fresh meat industry in the two concessions and all slaughtering companies are suffering from the fresh pigs arriving in Shanghai from Jiangbei being forcibly detained and sold, causing customers to hesitate, a lack of sources, skyrocketing meat prices, doubled costs, and huge losses. Moreover, the "Livestock Market" has raised the spot price, monopolizing the city's meat supply. It is really impossible to do business. Yesterday, it was decided that, from now on, all selling and slaughtering will be temporarily suspended. However, all meat shops are determined not to close their doors, to show that they are forced to close the market. In order to maintain order, all employees of all meat shops will stay in the stores and are not allowed to go out. It was also decided on two mottoes: "Do not make empty arguments, do more law-abiding things," and to inform the industry as a whole to comply. A reporter from the New Voice Society learned from the fresh meat industry yesterday that there are more than 1,000 fresh meat shops and stalls in the Public Concession and the French Concession, from Ningbo, Jiangsu, and Suzhou, normally selling 2,000 pigs. Since the industry decided to temporarily stop selling, each meat shop will implement the no-sale policy after the fresh meat is sold out.

### British Merchant Ships Will Be Escorted by British Warships; Maintain Original Routes Despite Threats; Four German and Italian Ships Permitted to Be Released by Japanese; Detained Portuguese Ships Face Confiscation

After Japan blockaded various coastal ports in China, it obstructed the shipping industry of various countries in China, arbitrarily detaining and inspecting merchant ships of various countries, attempting to monopolize trade with China. British merchants such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have decided to maintain their original routes in China and have requested the British Navy to send warships to carry out escort duties. The detained Portuguese ships have even been renamed. Details are as follows:

Obstructing the Shipping Industry of Various Countries in China

After Japan used its naval power to blockade various coastal lines in China, it obstructed merchant ships of various countries from sailing to various ports, resulting in Portuguese, Norwegian, Greek, Brazilian, Hungarian, British, German, and Italian merchant ships being unreasonably detained in Shanghai, Taiwan, Xiamen, and other places. There are as many as twenty-five ships, including the Tang Lu, De Ping, Gong Sheng, and Tian Bao. Merchant ships from various countries sailing along the coast of China have been hindered and inspected by Japanese warships, too many to list. The purpose of Japan's obstruction of the shipping industry of various countries is to attempt to monopolize trade in China, while at the same time using military relations as an excuse to prohibit merchant ships of various countries from sailing to non-occupied areas.

British Warships Carry Out Armed Escort

In order to maintain the shipping industry in China, British merchants such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have decided not to be threatened by the Japanese and are striving to maintain their original routes, agreeing to focus on the South China route, and designating ships to sail to Wenzhou, Ningbo, Fuzhou, Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Shantou. At the same time, the British naval authorities will send warships to carry out armed escort on the South China route. British merchant ships and British warships will establish contact. As for the Wenzhou and Fuzhou routes, the Japanese will prevent them from sailing, but British merchants such as Butterfield & Swire and Ewo Yulong are still sending ships to sail, determined not to be obstructed by the Japanese and temporarily suspend navigation.

German and Italian Ships Have Been Permitted to Be Released

According to news from the shipping industry, although the consuls of Portugal, Britain, Germany, Italy, Norway, and other countries have protested to the Japanese regarding the ships detained by Japanese warships, the Japanese have refused to release them, citing unclear nationality or carrying prohibited items. It is rumored that the Japanese have agreed to release the De Ping of the Italian China-Italy Company, the Tian Bao of the German Schütze & Co., the Wei Jin of the German Siemssen & Co., and the Gao Deng of the German Ruhlin & Co. However, as of last night, there was still no evidence of their release. Despite repeated negotiations, no results have been achieved for the other detained ships.

Detained Portuguese Ships May Be Confiscated

Eighteen Portuguese merchant ships, including the Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, and Tang Lu, operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route in eastern Zhejiang, the Shanghai-Dinghai route, the Beisha route in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the Jiangnan ports, have been detained one after another by the Japanese naval authorities, and have been ordered by Japanese warships to fly the Japanese flag. Although the Portuguese Consulate in Shanghai has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Consul Miura, no results have been achieved. Furthermore, some Portuguese ships have been renamed, indicating an intention to confiscate them. It is now known that the Portuguese Consulate has reported the situation to its government due to difficulties in negotiating in Shanghai, and has formally protested to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, negotiating through diplomatic channels between the two countries. Whether a solution can be obtained in the future is uncertain.

### International Airmail Postage; Alternate Compromise Method

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1543: "It has been found that the fees for international airmail items delivered via various foreign air routes must be calculated separately due to the different air routes, which is very cumbersome. Therefore, the Directorate General of Posts has formulated a new list of extra airmail fees for international airmail items based on a compromise method. All lists of fees for international airmail items previously attached to this Bureau's Notice No. 1460 are hereby abolished. The new list of extra airmail fees for international airmail items can be obtained from this Bureau for the information of the public."

### Dispute Over Demolition of Houses in Qingyuli

According to the New Voice Society, the relocation case in Qingyuli, New Chongqing Road in the city has not been resolved. Unfortunately, a dispute over the demolition of houses occurred yesterday. The female bank, the leaseholder of the alley, hired more than a hundred workers, all wearing white cloth symbols, at eight o'clock in the morning to demolish the houses and order the tenants to move out, because the tenants refused to move out after their lease expired. The gate of No. 12, Alley 1 was first chiseled open, and then the doors and windows were removed, damaging the furniture. The owner of the house, Mr. Fan, came downstairs in his pajamas, asking for a court order, and asking where the bailiffs and law enforcement officers were, but no one could answer. At that time, neighboring tenants came to see what was going on, and the crowd grew. The police sent four Western constables and more than ten Chinese constables to the scene to suppress the situation. During the commotion, three women in the Fan family were injured, one of whom was pushed down the stairs. It is said that there were no major problems. Seeing the serious situation, the Western constables ordered representatives to go to the police station to resolve the matter, and ordered the female bank to withdraw the workers. The tenants nominated representatives Qian Huafo, Qian Zhuyu, and Ma Huaqing to go to the police station. A thousand tenants followed. The police persuaded the representatives to inform the tenants not to take any action, because the matter was a civil case and was not accepted. It is rumored that the tenants have sent the iron rods and iron shovels abandoned by the workers to the police station for safekeeping, preparing for proper negotiations.

Pay the fee, so as to transfer it. I will immediately ask the association to report the arrest and punish them, etc.' I hereby inform you of the situation and hope you will act accordingly. Please do not delay and cause trouble. This is addressed to Mr. Wang Maosheng of the Dongxin Hotel, Lawyer Chen Tingrui."

### Dongxinshengji Hotel Swallows Refugee Donations from Travelers; Collects Refugee Donations without Receipts and Does Not Pay to the Association; Cover-Up is Exposed, Destroys Public Notices and Denies Evidence

In order to maintain the lives of refugees, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been doing its best to raise funds. Various industries, led by their respective guilds, have been sparing no effort to donate a percentage of their business income to the refugees. The Hotel Association has also been entrusted by the Association to collect a 5% refugee donation based on the room rate, starting from November 11th of last year. The results have been remarkable. However, the Dongxinshengji Hotel at No. 47 Baoyuli, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and East Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, was opened by Wang Maosheng from Taizhou. Wang was very generous, but unfortunately died in the bomb explosion at the Great World. Afterwards, his younger brother Maosheng took over. Unexpectedly, Maosheng not only did not continue his elder brother's legacy, but also allowed the accountant Chen Dachang to

secretly pocket

the refugee donations that the Hotel Association entrusted them to collect.

When the Association urged them to pay, they claimed that they had not collected from the travellers and refused to pay. The Association did not know the details and did not pursue it, and no one reported it, so they were able to get away with it. But good times don't last forever. A traveler named Wang Zhen (手辰), who works in the press, couldn't find a place to live, so he rented a room at the hotel at the end of last year and has been there for four months, paying the room rate and the refugee donation on a daily basis, but he never received a receipt. Although he repeatedly negotiated with the porter, it was always delayed. Yesterday (the 10th), Mr. Wang had to move elsewhere and asked the hotel for a receipt again. The porter actually

said there were no receipts

in this store. He was being unreasonable and arguing arbitrarily. Mr. Wang became suspicious, so he read the association's monthly announcements in the newspaper about the collection of refugee donations by hotels, but Dongxin was not listed. Out of righteous indignation, he reported to the Association by telephone, and the Association forwarded the call to the Hotel Association to investigate. However, there was no "Dongxin" account in the accounts of the Association. Chairman Xu Wenzhao sent staff to the hotel to investigate, and they saw that the Association's notices were posted in each room, and next to the notice was added "Refugee donation collected by this room × points" (calculated as 5%), and the seal of "Wang Maosheng" was affixed. When asked, the porter replied that the refugee donations collected were handed over to the accounting room, but when questioned, the accountant Chen Dachang absolutely denied collecting them. The facts were contradictory. The Association staff saw that he was unreasonable and reported the facts to the Association, but halfway there, they thought they must obtain evidence to avoid his quibbling, so they rushed back to the hotel to take photos of the posted notices. Unexpectedly, Chen Dachang was leading the porter to

tear down the notices

in each room. They snatched two of the notices from the porter's hand and took them back to the Association for filing. After receiving the detailed report, Chairman Xu was extremely indignant and sent a lawyer's letter to the hotel owner Wang Maosheng yesterday, ordering him to pay all the donations collected in the past two days, and they would report the arrest and punishment, and report to the Association for instructions on how to deal with it. The

original lawyer's warning

letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs, according to the Shanghai Hotel Association, our association was entrusted by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association in November last year to handle the collection of relief funds from the industry. It was decided that from November 11th of the same year, all hotels should collect 5% of all room rates to fulfil their relief responsibilities. A notice was distributed and everyone complied. However, the Dongxin Hotel has not paid this relief fee for several months, and although we have repeatedly tried to collect it, they insisted that they have not collected it from the guests and refused to pay. Now, a resident of the hotel, Wang Shou Chen, has reported that the public notices of the Refugee Relief Association are posted in each room, and the relief fee of 5% is collected uniformly, etc. After sending staff to investigate, it was found to be true, and the above-mentioned notice (stamped with the seal of the hotel owner Wang Maosheng) was taken back to the association for evidence. It was found that the hotel embezzled charitable donations and secretly pocketed them. Such behavior is extremely illegal. Please ask your lawyer to send a letter of warning on behalf of the hotel, ordering them to pay all the 5% of the relief fee that should have been collected from November 11th of last year to the end of April this year to our association as a whole. Pay the fee, so as to transfer it. I will immediately ask the association to report the arrest and punish them, etc.' I hereby inform you of the situation and hope you will act accordingly. Please do not delay and cause trouble. This is addressed to Mr. Wang Maosheng of the Dongxin Hotel, Lawyer Chen Tingrui."

### Taiping Bank Shares; Devalued and Merged into Guohua Bank; The Shares Are Priced at 55% of Face Value; One of the Shareholders Suddenly Disagrees and Sues for Price Compensation

Taiping Bank merged into Guohua Bank on July 1st of the year before last. At that time, the authorities of the two banks decided that all Taiping shares would be priced at 55% of the face value of the capital silver and exchanged for Guohua shares to become Guohua shareholders. If anyone holding Taiping shares was unwilling to accept the decided discount, the resulting disputes would still be handled by the responsible person of Taiping. Therefore, before the merger of Li Yuanmao and Taiping, he had received several thousand yuan worth of

Taiping shares.

Because he was unwilling to accept such a huge sacrifice, he repeatedly negotiated with Wan Maozhi, the manager of Taiping, for more than a year, but was unable to resolve it. Now Li has hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to file a lawsuit against Wan in the First Special District Local Court, demanding compensation for losses. This case concerns the interests of Taiping shareholders and the decision of the two banks on that day, which is not a trivial matter. Judge Gui, who is hearing the case, is not tired of seeking details. Yesterday afternoon, he continued to hold a court session to examine the evidence. Both the plaintiff and the defendant did not appear in person.

The witnesses summoned

were Wang Shuzhi, formerly of Kaiyuan Maoyong Gold Store, and Tang, a representative of Guohua Bank, who both appeared in court. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Pingfan, the Taiping shares held by the plaintiff originally belonged to Wang Chengzhi, whose account names were Shaoji, Shiji, Zhiji, and Chengji. They were transferred to the plaintiff's hands. It was found that Taiping was merged into Guohua, starting on July 1, 1937. Two months before the merger, dividends for the previous year were still issued to the shareholders. According to the Company Law, dividends are not issued to shareholders without surplus. By the time of the merger, it was

discovered that there was a loss

and the shares were discounted, indicating that the defendant had committed a criminal act at that time. Moreover, quite a few Taiping shareholders had not received the notice of the decided discount, and the plaintiff was one of them. Now, he asks the court to order the defendant to submit the signature book of the meeting on that day for review of the names of the people present at the meeting, etc. The defense lawyers of the defendant Wan Maozhi, E Sen and Li Mian, immediately retorted, saying that the decision to discount the shares by 55% had been accepted by shareholders with capital of 3 million, and only the plaintiff

still held objections.

At the time of the decision, the plaintiff was not yet a shareholder and was naturally not notified. As for the relevant books and records, many were not in the hands of the defendant, because the defendant was only the manager of Taiping, and above him were the general manager Zhu Jing'an and the chairman of the board, etc. Moreover, Zhu is now deceased, so he cannot submit the case, etc. Then the witness Wang Shuzhi testified that Wang Chengzhi owed his gold store more than 10,000 yuan, and Wang wanted to use the shares to offset the entire debt. By the time he sent the seal to Taiping for safekeeping, Wang was evading him. At that time, Wang was the assistant manager of Taiping. The Guohua representative Tang also stated the matter once. Judge Gui adjourned the hearing to a later date and ordered the two to bring the books and other documents to the court next time for verification.

### Japanese Hinder the Transport of Pigs on the Tonghe Wheel; The British Navy Will Protest; 500 Pigs Loaded at Xin'gang; In the End, Forced to Unload at the Original Place

The British-owned Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Tonghe wheel loaded 500 pigs from Jiangbei on the 8th of this month to transport them to Shanghai. When it approached Xin'gang, it was suddenly blocked by a Japanese destroyer. At that time, 12 Japanese naval personnel boarded the wheel and interrogated the items. On the other hand, they ordered the Tonghe wheel's owner, Bai Laiqiu (transliteration), to unload the pigs, claiming that British wheels were not allowed to load and transport pigs. Mr. Bai immediately questioned and refused the Japanese side's illegal order, and ordered his deputy to quickly send an official document to the British wheel "Scorpion" that was patrolling there. It is now known that the Tonghe wheel sailed from Xin'gang to Shanghai at 1:30 p.m. on the 11th and docked at the Garden Wharf. Compared with the original itinerary, it was delayed by 24 hours. The reporter learned that all the pigs were not loaded. According to the Tonghe wheel crew members, when the wheel approached Xin'gang, 12 Japanese naval personnel boarded the wheel to prevent the loading of pigs and transport them to Shanghai, saying that it was on the orders of the Xin'gang pig control authorities to supervise the unloading. At that time, the shipowner refused, and then reported to the British Yangtze River Fleet's "Scorpion" warship commander. The British warship commander advised the shipowner to unload the goods first and wait for legal negotiations. The shipowner complied and sailed the wheel near the Xin'gang shore and unloaded all the pigs, and then sailed to Shanghai. The British naval authorities are investigating the situation. Regarding the Japanese soldiers boarding British ships to arbitrarily obstruct, they will soon lodge a protest with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again.

### Bizarre Soil Transportation Case Occurs in the Huangpu River

Fifteen Cases of Opium Thrown from the Desheng Steamer, Floating on the Water and Not Sinking, a Small Boat Loaded Full and Departed, "Water Police" Intercepted Ahead and Took to the Japanese Consulate

Yesterday afternoon in the Huangpu River, a drug trafficking case occurred involving the ingenious and large-scale transportation of opium. The transporter was a small boat flying a Japanese flag. For some unknown reason, it was intercepted by a "water police team" from a fake "police station." It is said that all the opium was subsequently taken from the fake "police team" by Japanese military police and sent to the Japanese consulate for disposal. The main figure in the drug trafficking remains unknown, and the inside story is confusing. Initially, the Desheng steamship of Jardine Matheson arrived in Shanghai from South China and sailed into the Wusong port. At the

Gaotangpu Bank

someone threw down fifteen leather cases, which did not sink upon hitting the water. Shortly thereafter, a pre-arranged small boat, flying a Japanese flag to prevent searches and interference, sailed to the cases and individually retrieved them, turning the rudder and heading upriver towards Shanghai. Not long after, a yellow fake "Shanghai City" No. 1 small boat sailed from the Shanghai direction, carrying more than twenty armed fake "water police," blocking the path of the Japanese-flagged boat and ordering it to stop. The "fake police" then boarded the small boat, intending to search it. At that point, a man speaking fluent Japanese

Stepped Forward to Interfere

claiming that the cargo consisted of cigarettes and no illegal items. The "fake police" did not believe him and used iron spikes to pierce the leather cases. Detecting the smell of opium from the punctures, they moved all fifteen cases to the fake "Shanghai City" small boat and forced the Japanese-flagged boat to sail back to the Dongchang Road pier in Pudong together. A total of six people, including the boat's captain, a driver, a sailor, and two Chinese and one Japanese man (the one who spoke Japanese and interfered with the search) escorting the cases, along with the fifteen leather cases, were taken to the fake "team" in Dongchang Road.

Opening the Leather Cases

revealed that each case contained a rectangular lead box, sealed with solder, wrapped in a white cloth bag, further wrapped in cotton padding, and finally wrapped in oilcloth. Each lead box contained 500 taels of Yunnan opium, totaling 7,500 taels, worth over 100,000 gold yuan. Around 3 p.m., a Japanese naval military police detachment, carrying documents from the Japanese consulate, took the opium and the suspects for processing. It is understood that the drug traffickers used ingenious means to retrieve the opium at Wusong port to avoid customs searches.

### Young Man and Woman Commit Suicide in a Closed Room

The Man Died, the Woman is Also in Critical Condition. Around 9 p.m. the previous evening, a young man from Danyang, accompanied by a young woman, checked into the Xinsheng Hotel at the intersection of Baike Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, opening room number 31. The man claimed to be Zhang Bingfa, and the woman, Zhang Yu, was nearly twenty years old. They falsely claimed to be husband and wife. Around 3 a.m. the following morning, the night-shift attendant noticed moaning sounds from the room and managed to open the door. He found both the man and woman had taken poison and were unconscious. He immediately summoned an ambulance to rush them to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the man, Zhang Bingfa, died shortly after due to an overdose of poison. The woman is also in critical condition. It was later learned that the woman's surname was Fan, and she was from Wuxi. Her brother is a bookkeeper at the Wangfu Nail Factory on Yichang Road. The reason for the young man and woman's double suicide is believed to be a lack of freedom in marriage.

### Fire on Guling Road, Two Boys Burned to Death, Families of Both Children Also Injured

A fire broke out at approximately 8:16 a.m. yesterday near No. 70, Qiaji Rice Depot, adjacent to the Pure Land Nunnery on Guling Road. Black smoke filled the sky, and flames spread everywhere. At this time, the wind added to the intensity, and the fire spread rapidly. The Central Fire Department dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire. A female tenant in the attic and Chen Zubei (40 years old) from Yixing, along with his wife, Chen Yu (35 years old), jumped from the burning building in panic because the stairs were burnt through, and they were injured in the fall. Their daughter, Jin Nian (13 years old), was also burned on her head and hands. They were later taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment by ambulance. Chen's son, Jin Qing (10 years old), and younger son, Ju Qing (9 years old), did not escape and perished in the fire. Firefighters found them in the rubble, their bodies charred beyond recognition, a truly tragic sight. The fire was extinguished after more than an hour, destroying a large room and over a hundred dan of white rice, resulting in significant losses.

### Robbery of Gambling Den, Detective Shot

At approximately 5:35 p.m. yesterday, five thugs, four armed with handguns, broke into a large gambling den on a branch road of Roberts Road in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, to rob it. The exact amount stolen is unknown. As the bandits fled with their loot, the gambling den's bodyguards pursued them. When the bandits passed the entrance of the Tianle Theatre, detectives from the Putuo Road Police Station's search team were patrolling the area. The bandits encountered the detectives head-on and, in a preemptive move, opened fire. A bullet struck Detective No. 1486 in the left hip, causing a gush of blood, and he fell to the ground. The gunman then disappeared into the crowd. The detective did not return fire at the time. The injured detective was subsequently taken to the police hospital by ambulance. The police station is currently seeking to apprehend the bandits and bring them to justice. Another report states that at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, six men in plain clothes, resembling gangsters, secretly carrying weapons, approached the Yiji Gambling Den's first branch, located outside the Gongyifang in Renshou Lane on Roberts Road in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, demanding funds, which led to a dispute. The den's guards, upon hearing the commotion, came out to question them, and they exchanged more than twenty shots from handguns and other weapons. A patrol from the Public Concession's police headquarters, alerted by the gunfire, rushed to the scene to make arrests and were shot and wounded, falling to the ground. A police vehicle arrived shortly after and apprehended several suspects, while the wounded officers were transported to a nearby hospital for treatment.

### Encounter with a Female Hostess, Cohabitation in a Rented House, Legal Wife Reports Adultery, Police Charge with Adultery and File a Public Prosecution, Legal Wife Sues for Living Expenses

Wu Zihua (also known as Fengsheng), the manager of the Rixin Sheng Foreign Goods Company on Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, a native of Ganpu, Zhejiang, is already in his sixties. Thirty-five years ago, he married a woman surnamed Dong through a matchmaker. They have a son and two daughters, all of whom are married. Although Wu is old, he still enjoys the company of women. In 1932, while visiting the Quan Yun Lou amusement park in the Wing On Company, he took a liking to Zai Wenyang (then only 19 years old), a female hostess from Huzhou at the children's theater. Soon after, they began

Cohabitation in a Rented House

at No. 144 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road. The following year, they had a daughter, who is now seven years old. Since gaining Zai Wenyang, Wu has become somewhat discriminatory towards his aging wife and has left Dong in their old home in their hometown, while he spends his days leisurely in Shanghai. In 1937, Dong came to Shanghai from Ganpu, and although Wu rented a house for her at No. 27 Yongfu Lane, Caishi Road, she still faced unequal treatment. The

Elderly Couple

often quarreled. On February 28th of last year, Wu even physically assaulted Dong over a trivial matter. Unable to bear it, she moved to No. 5 Dapu Lane, Rue du Père Froc, at the beginning of March. At this time, Wu stopped providing her with living expenses. Dong hired a lawyer to negotiate with Wu, and Wu initially agreed to give her 20,000 yuan in living expenses, but later reneged on his promise. Dong then, on November 1st of last year,

Published a Warning in the Newspaper

demanding that Wu fulfill his promise, but to no avail. Dong later learned that Wu's change in behavior was due to another affair, but she did not know where he was hiding his mistress. She secretly hired detectives to investigate Wu's movements. It was not until February 5th of this year that they were discovered. She then hired lawyer Li Pengcheng to report the matter to the Laozha Police Station on March 6th. On the 24th, the police station ordered detective Zhang Keqin and others to rush to the scene, where they found the

Old Man and Young Mistress

and arrested them. After questioning, because Wu had a legitimate occupation, they were temporarily released. They then requested the First Special Court to issue a summons and brought Wu Zihua and Zai Wenyang to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning, where Judge Dai Rongduo presided over the hearing. Police lawyer Qian Kujiu presented the facts of the case and charged them with adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Code, requesting that they be punished accordingly. Wu Dong was also represented by lawyer Li, who

Filed a Civil Suit

demanding that Wu Zihua pay living expenses of 180 yuan per month for a period of twelve years, totaling 21,600 yuan. When questioned, Wu Zihua did not deny the adultery with Zai Wenyang but argued that the plaintiff had known about it as early as 1934 and that the current lawsuit was an attempt to blackmail him. Zai Wenyang testified that she had become

a Female Hostess

at the Wing On Company due to financial hardship and had been seduced by Wu to cohabitate with him. Wu had promised to marry her at the time but had never fulfilled his promise, so she had also been deceived by him. After arguments from Wu's lawyers, Wu Linkun and Xiao Baichuan, and Zai Wenyang's lawyer, Tao Wuzhi, Judge Dai announced the end of the debate and set the date for the verdict on the 18th.

### Li Rongsheng and His Wife Act as Gods and Ghosts, Swindling Gullible Men and Women, Second Landlords and Others Swindled Out of Thousands of Yuan, Ineffective Immortals Ultimately Lead to the Case Being Solved and Arrests Made

Tong Hanzhang, a Ningbo native who runs the Dafengheng Customs Brokerage on the upper floors of the Times Building at No. 160 Edward Road in the British Concession, and his wife, Tong Wu, reside at No. 33 Renyuan Lane, at the intersection of Rue de Belier and Avenue Anaquin in the French Concession. They were recently swindled out of more than 3,000 yuan over the past two years by Li Rongsheng (55 years old), a fellow townsman and co-tenant, and his mistress, Shen (47 years old). Fellow tenants Cao Li and Xu Jinlan were also swindled out of several hundred yuan. It was only recently that Tong Wu discovered Li's

Fraudulent Activities

and reported them to the French Police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Li Rongsheng and Shen. They were brought to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday, where Judge Wu Kechou questioned them. Attorney Fei Xizhen of the French Concession Administration presented the case, stating that the investigation had not yet begun and requesting a postponement pending further investigation. Complainant Tong Wu then described the beginning and end of the swindle and the current state of discovery, stating that the defendants moved into their home before the war. When the war broke out, her husband and she planned to flee back to Ningbo. At that time, the defendants saw that they had

Hundreds of Dollars Hidden

in their luggage and immediately conceived a plan to defraud them. First, on September 15th, Tong Wu went out to buy groceries and returned home to find a fire in the empty basket in the room. She quickly extinguished it, but immediately became suspicious. She went to a fortuneteller, who said it was a conflict between the household god and a great immortal. Before long, she heard a loud noise in the empty room. Upon entering, she saw a large bowl shattered to pieces and then discovered a piece of yellow paper with red writing that said, "Zhou Daxian (Great Immortal Zhou) has said that Tong Wu's fate is exhausted and she should die, but considering your kind heart, I have ordered a Chen Bingnian

to Substitute for Your Death

However, you must hand over 300 yuan to me." Mrs. Tong was terrified and immediately set up an altar for the Great Immortal and placed 300 yuan in the drawer of the altar and locked it. After a while, the money in the drawer disappeared. Since then, there have been repeated incidents of spontaneous fires, broken bowls in the empty room, and the loss of ornaments and money from the rooms of the second and third landlords. Recently, Mrs. Tong discovered that the wife of Li Rongsheng's son was wearing a gold ring inlaid with jewels on her hand, which was one of her lost items. On the day of Lixia (Start of Summer), she lost two salted eggs and immediately

Burned Incense and Prayed Silently

before the Great Immortal, saying, "Your faithful disciple has repeatedly received messages from the Great Immortal, saying how good Li Rongsheng is and instructing your disciple to hand over a certain amount of currency in order to have peace. Now that you are so powerful, please take away all the messages within a quarter of an hour." But after a long time, they were not taken away, and then she realized that she had been fooled. She approached Li Rongsheng and his wife, who agreed to return the gold ring and other items, so she reported them to the police and had them arrested. A copy of the landlady's room key and the key to the Great Immortal's altar drawer were found on their bodies. She requested that they be severely punished according to the law. Li confessed, claiming to make a living by chanting Ningbo ballads, and gave evasive answers to other questions. The court reviewed the testimony and decided to postpone the hearing until the 15th. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Vietnamese Police Officer Killed, Key Suspects Apprehended, Three Russians Arrested, Investigation Yields Clues

The Continental Daily reported that Nguyen, a Vietnamese police officer in the French Concession, was on patrol around 11:30 p.m. on the 2nd of this month near the intersection of Route Cardinal Mercier and Avenue Petain when he saw two foreigners acting suspiciously. He ordered them to stop, but one of them shot him, and he died from his injuries at the hospital around 4 p.m. on the 10th. The French Concession's Central Police Station yesterday apprehended

Three White Russian

suspects, Valeryanenko (28 years old), Klimov (31 years old), and Kochunier (30 years old). Valeryanenko was arrested by detectives from the French Concession and patrols from the Public Concession in the Hongshan District on Tuesday. He was handed over to the French Concession authorities and detained at the French Concession Central Police Station on Boulevard de Montigny. After several hours of interrogation, the other two suspects were also

Apprehended

in the Laozha District and transferred to the French Police for questioning. French police officials are keeping the matter secret and will not provide any information to the press until the three suspects are confirmed to be the real perpetrators. However, the Continental Daily has confirmed the matter and learned from responsible sources that the police have obtained some evidence against the three suspects. The only

Clue

obtained by the police after the Vietnamese police officer was shot was a broadsword dropped by one of the fleeing bandits. It is said that there was a fingerprint of the owner on the sword, which led to the arrest of one of the three suspects. It is also said that the police have obtained the fingerprints of all three suspects, but the French Concession authorities are keeping silent about the matter and may not issue a formal statement until the investigation is complete.

### Large Number of Bandits Arrested at the Old Eastern Hotel and Other Places, Four Handguns and Ammunition Seized, Transferred to the Court for Further Investigation

Chief Chinese Inspector Yun Fu and Inspector Chen Yonggui of the Laozha Police Station, along with detectives Li Pengfei and Zhang Keqin, officers Chen Zhihong and Shan Zhaoxian, and Western detective La Aite, arrested four bandits at the intersection of Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road yesterday: Pan Zixiang from Tongzhou, Liu Shenghong from Zhenjiang, Zhao Tianpei from Shaoxing, and Shan Shufang from Taicang. They then arrested Zhang Changsheng from Sichuan at No. 7 Shanxi Road and Li Ziyun from Sichuan and Liu Sen from Hubei at No. 250 Dachuantong. Three handguns and sixteen bullets were seized. Next, at Room 124 of the Old Eastern Hotel at No. 245 Zhejiang Road, they apprehended nineteen accomplices: Shao Yinghui from Taicang, Gao Jincai from Minhang, Yao Xianyu, Cai Weihe, and Liu Zhenqing from Yangzhou, Tao Guoyi and Wang Weiguo from Shanghai, Ding Shuchun from Changshu, Fang Xianggen and Zhou Zihong from Ningbo, Hu Apeng, Zhang Guoshu from Taicang, Zhang Rongbao from Yangzhou, Wang Wangen from Zhenjiang, Tang Jianxiong and Chen Jinchuan from Ningbo, Gao Jingxing from Taicang, Xu Tianyao from Ningbo, and Chen Shi. A handgun and eight bullets were also seized in the French Concession. The twenty-six bandits, four handguns, and twenty-four bullets were taken to the police station and transferred to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi presented the case, stating that many suspects were apprehended and requesting permission to detain them. Judge Qian questioned them and granted permission to detain them for fourteen days for further questioning.

### Merchant Sues for Owed Payment, But First Files False Charges, Silk Shop Owner Loses the Case

Qiang Jicheng from Hangzhou, who runs the Hengji Xiang Silk Shop at No. 58 South Wuxi Road in Shanghai, purchased goods from the Merry Silk Weaving Factory from May of last year, accumulating a debt of over 1,000 yuan. The factory was unable to collect the debt. Qiang initially avoided meeting them and then preemptively fabricated a draft contract and forged the signature of Yang Zixiang, the manager of the Merry Factory, and filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court seeking over 2,000 yuan in damages. Upon learning of this, the defendant hired lawyers Yu Ximin and Gu Peilun to file a defense, stating that the signature was forged, and filed a counterclaim to collect the owed payment. Judge Peng Shi of the First Special Court repeatedly questioned them and sent the signature for authentication. The results proved that it was indeed a forgery. Judge Peng then ruled in court, dismissing the plaintiff Hengji Xiang's lawsuit. The plaintiff was ordered to pay the defendant Merry Factory (the plaintiff in the counterclaim) 1,076 yuan in national currency. The costs of the lawsuit and counterclaim were to be borne by the plaintiff.

Chinese Medicine and Diet

### Kelp Treats Scrofula

— Zhang Zanchen

Scrofula often occurs between the neck. The lumps resemble strings of beads. At first, the nodules are like bean grains, movable when pressed. Over time, they gradually enlarge like plums, with roots when pressed, and varying degrees of hardness. They are not easily dispelled. They can even form abscesses, leaving fistulas after rupturing, which are extremely difficult to heal, making them the most stubborn of sores. Patients often become averse to taking medicine for extended periods. At this time, kelp (commonly known as seaweed, due to its shape resembling cloth) can be used in any amount. Wash it thoroughly, chop it into small pieces, boil it until extremely soft, and mix it into food. Or, it can be cooked with chicken, duck, pork, etc., according to preference, and used as a side dish. Kelp is salty and cold in nature and functions to soften hardness and resolve phlegm. It is good at eliminating scrofula nodules. Furthermore, it is chemically and pharmacologically rich in iodine-protein compounds. Therefore, sufferers of scrofula can eliminate the focus of their illness by eating it, gradually replenishing iodine, promoting cell metabolism, improving their constitution, and achieving the goal of healing. Furthermore, sufferers of scrofula often have weak stomachs. This substance can also treat the stomach, so it is like killing two birds with one stone.

### Yellow Croaker

— Zhang Huailin

Yellow croaker, commonly known as yellow fish, has two stones in its head, as clear as jade, and shaped like jade rabbits, hence the name stone-headed fish.

This fish has a golden-yellow skin. Fishermen see its light and hear its sound at night and catch it with nets. It always comes in large groups, forming ranks of thousands or tens of thousands. Therefore, during the yellow croaker season from March to August, it is often plentiful and cheap.

Yellow croaker is produced in the ocean and has a very delicious taste. Eating it makes people full. Fishermen even use it as a meal. During times of abundance, it is taken and dried, and called white dried croaker.

Yellow croaker is mild in nature and sweet in taste. Making it into a soup with West Lake water shield opens the stomach and benefits qi. However, because it is a marine product, it is pungent, and all external sores should avoid eating it. External surgical wounds should also avoid it after they are sealed up.

Yellow croaker is made into dried fish. The dried fish nourishes people, and the white ones are better. If it is not made properly, it will turn red and taste inferior. Lu Wenliang's Shuyuan Zaji states: "Dysentery most fears oily and cold foods, but white dried fish is suitable for eating. Yellow fish eats salt water and is not hot in nature, and it digests food and benefits the intestines and stomach." The people of Ningbo are accustomed to pregnant women eating white dried fish, also with this intention. Eating roasted white dried fish can eliminate the accumulation of melons and fruits, treat diarrhea, and eliminate accumulated food. However, those who do not live in Ningbo or along the coast do not need to eat it.

The stone in the head of the yellow croaker is called shidan and is also called fish brain stone. It treats stone strangury. Ground with water and taken, it can unblock urination. Burned into ash and ground into powder, it can be sprinkled on the ear to treat ear swelling and pus. Burned into ash and snuffed into the nose, it can treat long-standing nasal leakage.

The fish maw is the white gelatinous substance in the abdomen of the yellow fish. It nourishes kidney yin, fills essence, and benefits marrow. It is a precious tonic. However, this substance is not easy to digest. Strong people benefit from taking it, but weak people with poor digestion may experience greasy and difficult digestion.

### Seasonal Delights: Cherries and Bamboo Shoots

— Xu Jintao

——Can Help Erupt Measles——

The first of flowers is the plum blossom, and the first of fruits is the cherry. The cherry, also known as the "Jing Tao," comes in sizes ranging from that of a pellet to that of a gem. The small and red ones resemble cherry beads, with a vibrant color, often celebrated in ancient poetry. Bamboo shoots are also a delicacy among vegetables, greatly enjoyed by many. However, bamboo shoots are not easily digestible; those with yang deficiency or weak stomachs should not consume them in large quantities. Cherries, on the other hand, have a sweet taste and warming properties, easily promoting dampness. Eating them in small amounts is generally harmless. In terms of dietary therapy, cherries and bamboo shoots have significant benefits. For epidemic ailments like measles and smallpox, where the heat in the blood prevents full eruption, doctors often prescribe bamboo shoot tips as a guiding herb (freshly unearthed ones are most effective). This is because bamboo shoots have an ascending qi and a cooling, refreshing nature. Also, during the pustule stage of smallpox, carp is often cooked in soup with bamboo shoots to promote eruption. As for cherries, they can also treat measles and smallpox that are hidden and do not erupt, causing chest tightness, shortness of breath, and restlessness. This is due to internal heat, and cherries are most suitable because they can clear heat and promote drainage.

### Jujubes and Red Beans

— Dong Shuliu

Jujubes have a sweet taste and neutral properties, containing sugar and mucilage. They function to tonify the spleen and stomach, regulate nutrition and defense, treat cold and heat, and promote blood circulation. They can treat anemia, heart palpitations, anxiety, and diarrhea. Red beans have a sweet and slightly sour taste, neutral properties, and are non-toxic. They function to clear damp heat, remove blood stasis, and treat edema, diarrhea, abdominal distension, and red urine, as well as the discharge of pus and blood. The combination of these two ingredients is a moderate remedy for nourishing blood, promoting circulation, guiding dampness, and draining pus. Therefore, it is an effective prescription for anemia, intestinal bleeding, redness, and tumorous conditions. For ailments originating from the blood, whether due to deficiency or excess, it can be used.

(1) Anemia: Pale complexion, cold limbs, anxiety, insomnia, and even night sweats or hot palms are all caused by a lack of blood and sluggish circulation. Drinking a decoction of jujubes and red beans can replenish the blood and restore normal circulation. The nutrient qi originates from the middle jiao, and the spleen and stomach are the source of qi and blood. Therefore, using jujubes to tonify the middle and red beans to promote blood circulation is the appropriate treatment.

(2) Intestinal Bleeding: The cause of blood in the stool is often due to damp heat accumulating and damaging the blood vessels. Symptoms include abdominal pain with bloody stool, tenesmus, and urgency. Mild cases involve blood mixed with the stool, while severe cases consist of pure blood, which is bright red or dark purple and clotted. Jujubes have the function of generating new blood and breaking up blood stasis, while red beans have the effect of clearing dampness and promoting drainage. The combination of the two enhances their efficacy, making it a truly effective treatment for intestinal bleeding.

Tumorous Conditions: Qi and blood stagnate, causing obstruction and discomfort. Damp heat interacts and becomes trapped, resulting in growths on the limbs or internal organs. Initially, there is redness, swelling, heat, and pain, making it impossible to touch, along with fever, thirst, anxiety, and constipation. However, treating it with this decoction can resolve the condition if it has not ulcerated, and promote healing if it has already ulcerated. It is most effective for tumors and slightly less effective for ulcers.

According to this prescription, use more jujubes when treating anemia to enhance its tonifying effect. Use more red beans when treating intestinal bleeding and tumors to enhance its dispersing effect. If qi stagnation and blood deficiency are equal, then the two ingredients should not be disproportionate. The dosage of jujubes can range from one to four taels, or as little as three, five, or eight qian, and the same applies to red beans. However, as the condition changes unpredictably, the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. Patients should use their own discretion.

### "Unsanitary"

### Coix Seed Nourishes the Lungs

— Chen Jiazhen

Coix seed, also known as "Yi Ren," is commonly known as "Mi Ren." This substance is often seen as a minor item for dispelling dampness and not given much importance. However, according to a recent analysis report from the Komaba Agricultural School in Japan, coix seed is the most nutritious and easily digestible grain in the grass family. Its protein content is unmatched by other grains. It also contains a large amount of gluten, comparable to wheat, and is rich in fats, with a transparent texture. Among its organic components, the oil content is similar to oats, but its nutrition far surpasses it. Furthermore, it is quite rich in lime and phosphorus. (The Great Dictionary of Chinese Materia Medica also has a detailed explanation.) If elderly people with lung diseases can regularly consume it, the benefits would be immeasurable. The method of consumption is also very simple; just cook the coix seed into porridge (it must be cooked for four hours) and eat one bowl daily as a replacement for breakfast or a snack. However, adding sugar can easily cause illness and have the opposite effect.

Small Records of Dietary Nutrition

### Trachoma Mulberry Paste

— Yao Yijun

Trachoma is a chronic, specific infectious disease that easily spreads in schools, military camps, and public places. It is also easily transmitted through shared towels in teahouses, bars, theaters, bathhouses, and barber shops. Symptoms of trachoma include tearing, photophobia, stinging pain, incomplete eye opening, red and swollen eyelids, or corneal ulcers. If left untreated for a long time, it can lead to blindness. Patients can regularly take mulberry paste (available in Chinese pharmacies at a reasonable price), one spoonful each day, dissolved in hot water. It has a sweet and sour taste, and long-term use is not unpleasant. Taking it up to eight taels can gradually lead to recovery, without any adverse reactions or drawbacks. It is said to be the enemy of trachoma; who would say it is not appropriate?

### Apricot Kernel Dew Cures Coughs

— Zhang Zhongxian

For coughs with symptoms such as thirst, dry lips, and yellow phlegm, use two or three qian of apricot kernels, crushed and decocted into a soup. Mix it with hot tofu sauce and a small amount of white sugar and drink it. It can serve as a snack and also treat coughs. It is truly an economical and effective remedy for coughs.

### Sesame Paste and Honey

— Zhang Zhongxian

People with hard stools and constipation either have dryness and heat in the large intestine or dampness and cold in the stomach. If taking digestive medicines, it may harm the body's vital energy. It is best to eat sesame paste mixed in with side dishes or drink honey water as a substitute for tea. These are simple dietary methods to lubricate the intestines.

### Red Beans Have Remarkable Effects

— Jiang Jianchu

Red beans have a reddish-purple color. Their nutritional composition is not inferior to other beans; rather, they have unique advantages, namely, they are rich in iron. Iron is the main component of blood, so eating more of it can have a blood-tonifying effect. This food is most suitable for patients with leg swelling and is also effective for edema. My friend, Mr. Wang, suffered from a heatstroke last autumn and became yellow, thin, and emaciated. Following the doctor's advice, he drank a large bowl of red bean soup every morning for breakfast. After several months, his complexion became rosy and his illness disappeared completely.

### Pay Attention to Eliminating "Fetal Toxins" When Babies are Born

— Zhang Luo

In our country's ancient customs, before a newborn is breastfed, it is common to use methods to eliminate fetal toxins from the intestines and stomach. This is because the infant may have contracted heat in the blood or toxins from the mother's diet while in the womb, which accumulate in the infant's intestines and stomach, leading to difficult bowel movements and the later development of erysipelas and boils. Therefore, taking detoxifying agents can clear the impurities accumulated in the infant's intestines and stomach. This is indeed a good method. For detoxification, if the pregnant woman's constitution is inherently hot and the fetal fire is excessive, then use Sanhuang Tang (Da Huang, Huang Qin, Huang Lian, each five fen) for the infant to take. If the infant is born in winter and is exposed to cold, with red lips and a pale face, feed them a light ginger soup with brown sugar. Usually, three fen of Xihuang is placed on the child's tongue, allowing them to swallow it naturally. Or, decoct five fen of licorice into a juice and slowly administer it. Soon, the infant will pass black stools once or twice, followed by thin yellow stools, before returning to a normal state.

### Finance: Hong Kong Traders Resell, Gold Prices Fall Back

Yesterday's spot gold dark market situation was still extremely dull, and the situation was still difficult to escape a weak trend. However, although a certain gold shop (representing the Xiamen group) resumed purchasing in the middle, and securities traders also made some purchases, there were still many who profited and sold off. Moreover, jewelry shops and street vendors successively sold out, and Hong Kong speculators suddenly entrusted a certain jewelry shop to dump at a limit price. As a result, the position felt quite ample, so it ultimately continued to fall by four yuan, with sparse trading, only 600 taels. Jewelry gold still hung at the original price, and customs gold and pure English gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Falls Four Yuan

Starting in the morning at ten taels per bar, the initial opening was weak because buyers' interest was weak and there was a desire to sell at floating prices. First, a certain gold shop (representing the Xiamen group) purchased 50 taels each from money changers and fellow traders, with an opening price of 1,125 yuan, four yuan lower than the previous closing price. After the opening, the selling party, seeing that securities traders suddenly came to absorb, those who were cautious stopped watching and raised the price by three yuan. Then, securities traders purchased 50 taels each from gold shops and money changers, with a price of 28 yuan. After that, because securities traders stopped absorbing, floating positions resumed selling, and the situation was still weak. Jewelry shops sold 50 taels to money changers, priced at 28 yuan. Later, money changers sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop, priced at 25 yuan. After that, supply and demand were sparse, making the situation even more stagnant. Extending to noon, no transactions were seen, so the noon closing was still 25 yuan. In the afternoon, although a certain gold shop continued to aggressively purchase, money changers also supplied abundantly. A certain jewelry shop suddenly sold on behalf of Hong Kong traders, causing the situation to stagnate. First, a certain gold shop absorbed a total of 100 taels from money changers, priced at 25 yuan. Later, they also purchased a total of 200 taels from a certain jewelry shop, with the same price. After that, a certain jewelry shop still had a limited price of 25 yuan, but because a certain gold shop had stopped buying and watching, and no one else was interested, it was difficult to make a deal. Therefore, the evening closing price was still 2,125 yuan, resulting in a drop of four yuan compared to the previous evening closing price, with only a three-yuan difference throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold from the current gold shop was 2,130 yuan, and the buying price was 2,120 yuan. The current benchmark gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no transactions were made.

Jewelry Gold Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael remains unchanged, with Datong Bank at 216 yuan and Xintong Bank at 214 yuan, and the buying price at 208 yuan.

English Pure Gold Unchanged

A London dispatch on the 10th reported that English pure gold tended to be unchanged, with each ounce still at seven pounds, eight shillings, five and a half pence. As a result, the Chinese cash purchase price of the central bank was also unchanged at 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold also remained flat, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard benchmark gold price also did not change, still calculated at 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.

### British and American Exchange Markets: Futures Slightly Looser, Swap Slightly Tightened; Hong Kong Exchange Rate Quite Sharp

Yesterday, the exchange market was driven by the Bank of England (representing the Tianjin group), Japanese banking circles, and foreign firms competing to aggressively buy. In addition, Chinese merchant speculators also frequently absorbed futures of both British and American gold. However, the supply from foreign banks was still surging, and the willingness of Chinese brokers to sell was even stronger. Moreover, Chinese banks also followed suit to sell forward English gold, so the situation became more and more stable, presenting a flat-period loose trend. As a result, the swap was also slightly tightened. The overall transaction volume was still strong. The Hong Kong exchange rate was tight because it was reported that overseas communications in that area were strong. Therefore, foreign firms and money changers scrambled to buy, and the foreign banks' willingness to supply was not pleasant, so the tightening trend was quite sharp, ultimately tightening by 375.

In the early morning, the long and short London rates continued to shrink by 125, the New York silver price was unchanged, and the London raw gold also did not change. The exchange rate of English against American was 6 hao, and flat against Shanghai and France. The exchange rate of American against English was long 0625, and all flat against Shanghai and France. The central listing of each exchange rate was as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 8 banshi 25 for the English exchange rate and 16 yuan 0625 for the American exchange rate, with no rise or fall compared to the previous closing. After the opening, the Bank of England (representing the Tianjin group), Japanese banking circles, and foreign firms competed to aggressively buy. However, foreign banks, such as HSBC, also mutually supplied, resulting in little change. It is estimated that those advantageous to the Bank of England, Japanese Banks, and foreign firms have sequentially settled and collected HSBC · Mackarary · Huabi spot English gold at a rate of 8 banshi 25. Subsequently, foreign firms purchased a contract for a certain bank's spot American Exchange Rate at 16 yuan 0625. As the HSBC listing did not move and the White Silver Balancing Tax was revealed to be continuing, at a small amount of 7.5%, which is 5.25%, it was subsequently calculated. Afterwards, the Chinese Banks sold a contract to Chinese merchants for the June English Gold at 8 banshi 1875, then the Chinese merchants settled with Chinese brokers for the July English Gold at 8 banshi 140625, soon after settling on and including the July American exchange rate at 15 yuan 8125. Afterwards, foreign firms also settled a contract for a certain bank's June American Exchange Rate at 15 yuan 9375, sufficient to potentially leave a slightly softer feeling. Near noon, the foreign bank Andar sold a spot Hong Kong exchange rate of 55 yuan 75 to the foreign firm, subsequently, foreign firms’ willingness to sell turned light, and it was difficult to settle at the above transaction price, so the situation seemed to be softening slightly, to the extent that the foreign broker's spot selling prices for the English-American exchanges did not differ from those of the opening in the morning, and the Hong Kong exchange rate at 55 yuan 625.

For the after-market session, initially, a foreign firm jointly connected with Hui · Huabi · He Lan spot English Gold at a rate of 8 banshi 25. Subsequently, a contract for a certain bank's spot American Exchange Rate was sucked in at 16 yuan 0625. Later, a Chinese broker purchased the broker's spot American exchange at 16 yuan 0625 and 091275 together, to a degree in which the process became even more stable. At times, reports were heard that that communications in Hong Kong were strong, therefore foreign firms and money changers frequently sucked in an endless supply of Hong Kong exchange rates. Afterwards, the potential trend gave a continuing report of a slight softening, it is estimated that foreign firms and money changers had sequentially settled contracts for Andar · Netherlands · Chinese broker spot Hong Kong exchange rates from 55 and a half yuan to, softening to, 375. It reached the point that the bank's spot rates at close the sales prices were: English exchange rate at 8 banshi 25, American exchange rate at 16 yuan 0625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate at 55 yuan 375. The final result was that there were no gains or losses on the English and American exchange rates from the previous night's close, while the Hong Kong exchange rate experienced a softening of 375.

### Checks Are More Popular Than Paper Money; Foreign Banks Are Reluctant to Accept Paper Money; Clearing Checks Rise by Five Jiao

The negotiable instruments circulating in the Shanghai market are divided into two types: clearing checks (cashable on the same day) and exchange checks (cashable the next day). Since the August 13th incident, exchange checks could not be cashed the next day, resulting in a dark market discount rate. The highest rate was more than 70 yuan for every 1,000 yuan, turning clearing checks and exchange checks into two different chips. In the past year, clearing checks were further divided into foreign clearing checks (mutually used between foreign banks) and exchange clearing checks (mutually used between Chinese exchange banks). At that time, a discount fee had to be paid to exchange a clearing check for a foreign clearing check. Later, after the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry and the China Bank, Communications Bank, and various exchange banks negotiated, the Chinese banks withdrew the funds deposited in the foreign banks and deposited them in the committee instead. At the same time, the committee changed the original clearing check deposit interest rate from 1.5% per annum to 3% per annum, making the exchange clearing check and the foreign clearing check the same, without any distinction. Recently, foreign banks and Chinese merchants are willing to clear accounts with each other using clearing checks to avoid the trouble of counting paper money. Recently, if a large amount of paper money is deposited in foreign banks, the foreign banks are unwilling to accept it. Therefore, clearing checks are more in demand than paper money, resulting in a rise in the clearing price. In the market in the past two or three days, clearing checks have risen by about five jiao per thousand yuan compared to paper money, that is, one thousand yuan and five jiao in paper money is exchanged for one thousand yuan in clearing checks.

### Tianjin "Counterfeit Money" is Even Cheaper; Less Than 80% of Legal Tender

A Tianjin dispatch on the 11th reported that the dark market exchange rate of counterfeit "Lianyin Tickets" in the morning opening was 2 yuan and 5 jiao cheaper compared to the morning opening on the 10th. One hundred yuan of legal tender can buy one hundred and twenty-five yuan and five jiao of "Lianyin Tickets," that is, one yuan of "Lianyin Tickets" is only worth 7 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li, 8 hao, 1 si, 2 hu, 7 wei, 4 xian, 9 shu.

### Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Shanghai Exchange Rates are Stable

(Tianjin) A dispatch on the 11th reported that the exchange rate of English, American, and Shanghai currencies was the same as the previous day, and the market was stable. The morning opening prices are listed below: English Exchange Rate: 7 banshi 8125; American Exchange Rate: 15 yuan 25; Shanghai Exchange Rate: 105 yuan (Shanghai Exchange Rate is the amount that Tianjin should receive for 100 yuan of legal tender in Shanghai).

(Hong Kong) A dispatch on the 11th reported that the opening exchange rates of English, American, and Shanghai currencies were the same as the prices at 11:30 am on the 10th. At 11:05 am, the English Exchange Rate increased by 03125, with a price of 1 shilling, 2 banshi, 8125; the American Currency increased by 0625, with a price of 28 yuan 875.

The morning opening prices are listed below: English Exchange Rate: 1 shilling, 2 banshi, 78125; American Exchange Rate: 28 yuan 8125; Shanghai Exchange Rate: 179 yuan 25 (Shanghai Exchange Rate is the amount of Shanghai legal tender equivalent to 100 yuan of Hong Kong paper).

### Foreign Currencies Stable

Yesterday, English pure gold was unchanged, and the English-American exchange rate rose by 0625. In this port, foreign firms settled their accounts very actively, and banks supplied smoothly, so market prices were stable. Forward contracts continued to shrink, further proving the stability of foreign exchange. In the opening of spot gold, jewelry businesses' clients slightly sold off, and the market situation was weak. After entering the market, both supply and demand were scarce. In the afternoon, money changers slightly supplied, and transactions were scarce, so the market situation did not change. This was because the customer groups were observing from the sidelines and had not taken any rash action, so transactions suddenly decreased. The supply and demand of foreign currencies, English and American gold pounds, were still strong, and the price slightly decreased along with the spot gold. The transaction of English and American gold notes was smooth, and American gold notes slightly increased. The demand for Hong Kong notes slightly increased, and the price slightly rose. The supply and demand of other currencies were balanced, and transactions were not strong. The guild association's transactions were not made. Yesterday's market prices were: English gold pound decreased by 5 fen, American gold pound decreased by 1 jiao, American gold note increased by 1 li, and Hong Kong note increased by 3 li. Other currencies did not change.

### Discount Rate Unchanged; Interbank Lending Rate Increased by 1 Fen

Yesterday, the discount rate of exchange checks first decreased and then returned. The discount rate per thousand yuan slightly decreased to 50 yuan and 5 jiao in the morning, but soon returned to 50 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen. In the afternoon, it remained at the original price and did not change. It was also no different from the previous day's price. The interbank lending rate of money businesses has been fluctuating erratically recently and rose again by 1 fen yesterday, calculated at 1 jiao and 1 fen.

### London Rate Down, Indian Silver Flat

A London dispatch on the 10th reported that Indian and Citibank merchants were buying in the silver market, while mainland merchants and speculators were selling.

The short- and long-term London silver rates shrank again by 125. A New York silver dispatch reported that the American silver price remained unchanged. A Bombay dispatch also reported that the Indian silver market situation had turned flat, and both spot and futures prices remained unchanged.

### Securities Opening

Kaiping Stocks Soar, Domestic and Foreign Debts Slightly Rise

Securities unofficial market, yesterday's market situation, continued to fluctuate, with the bulls consistently holding their ground. Although there was intention to sell at higher prices, there was also a need to maintain market prices from falling, resulting in a dilemma. Both sides were waiting for changes in the environment, making it unlikely for significant ups and downs in the short term. Although there was a relatively large volume of trading in 96, the market price only increased by five cents. It is expected that the future will remain in a fluctuating state for the time being.

Tin Sang Jup Chung and Tung Hong Jup Ping Chung were bought. 96 was sold by Ting Hong and bought by Tung Hong, resulting in lively trading, with a sudden transaction of over 200,000 yuan. The rest of the trading remained weak. The afternoon saw more stable prices, with Dah Fung selling again, and Wing Fung and No. 52 also releasing shares. Nos. 20, 35, and Tin Sang retail investors bought slightly. Fluctuations remained small, slightly better by about one dime. The result was mixed, with price differences of only about one dime.

### Silk and Tea

Japanese and American Silk Prices Fall Sharply, Shanghai Factories Halt Exports, Inland Cocoon Factories Actively Sabotaged

Yesterday's silk market saw sharp declines in both Japan and the United States. New York nearby futures fell by one dime, equivalent to a decline of approximately 70 yuan in Shanghai, while distant futures fell by nine cents. Yokohama spot prices fell by 30 yuan, and distant futures fell by 31 yuan. The rest remained stable, but the impact on the local silk market was profound. Yesterday, foreign firms' white silk sales were at a standstill. Foreign firms reduced their price limits by 50 yuan, and manufacturers were unwilling to sell. British and French white silk stocks from the previous day also remained unsold. Refined silk was priced at 1,000 yuan by six foreign firms, but no deals were made. Indian firms have been quite active recently. Firms such as Samsung purchased 20 bales of Jiaxing refined silk yesterday, with prices rising by 15 yuan. On the 11th, 470 pieces of tea arrived from Hong Kong.

Inland cocoon factories continue to be actively sabotaged. It was learned yesterday that many factories have been burned down in the Wuxi and Jiangyin areas. Shanghai silk merchants' plans to register seem to have been halted as a result. The future of the cocoon market remains uncertain.

The price of foreign cotton in New York's cotton market initially rose due to slight trading among colleagues and positive telegrams from Liverpool and Bombay. At the same time, nearby prices rose sharply. However, because cotton prices had been rising for several days, a portion of the bulls took profits, and prices fell due to Southern hedging and New Orleans silk selling. As a result, nearby closing prices fell by two to nine points, and distant prices fell by twelve to thirteen points. Indian futures, including forecasts, fell by more than one rupee. Egyptian futures fell by two to three points. Converted to legal currency, cotton prices all fell, with American and Brazilian cotton each falling by eight cents per bale, Indian cotton falling by six cents, and Egyptian cotton falling by one yuan.

Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was very quiet. All factories had no transactions, but colleagues continued to purchase. Yesterday, they ordered more than 5,000 bales of Brazilian cotton in total. Indian cotton has been arriving daily recently, and another Japanese ship will arrive tomorrow, carrying more than 8,000 pieces of Indian cotton. According to reporter statistics, since last September, the total amount of Indian cotton shipped to Shanghai has reached more than 182,700 bales, accounting for nearly half of India's total exports. The following is a list of yesterday's cotton market prices converted for factory delivery:

| Category | Price for Factory Delivery Including Tax |
|---|---|
| 60 Count Egyptian Cotton, Superior Grade | 104.10 |
| 60 Count Egyptian Cotton, Medium Grade | 101.15 |
| 80 Count Egyptian Cotton, Superior Grade | 124.45 |
| 80 Count Egyptian Cotton, Medium Grade | 114.10 |
| 20 Count American Middling | 90.50 |
| 20 Count American Low Grade | 77.35 |
| 32 Count American Middling | 99.35 |
| 32 Count American Low Grade | 90.40 |
| 42 Count American Middling | 101.20 |
| 42 Count American Low Grade | 89.15 |
| South American Brazilian Cotton, Superior Grade | 88.75 |
| South American Brazilian Cotton, Medium Grade | 86.55 |
| South American Brazilian Cotton, Low Grade | 83.20 |
| 10 Count Indian Plain Apple | 65.05 |
| 16 Count Indian Omra | 71.40 |
| 20 Count Indian White Loach | 77.00 |
| 24 Count Indian Combodia | 83.00 |
| 32 Count American Short Staple | 86.60 |
| 32/43 Count American Punga Po | 91.15 |

The local cotton business is becoming increasingly desolate, while foreign cotton transactions are very prosperous. This is because the bottom line of local cotton is dwindling, and although there are 20-30% of cotton stocks in various local areas, they cannot be exported under the current environment and can only rot on the ground. As for the flower numbers, in view of the above situation, they have no goods to trade and it is difficult to maintain sitting idle for a long time. Therefore, they have changed to operating foreign cotton business. The source of cotton from Subei is continuous, but the amount is minimal. A total of 281 bales of Tongzhou flower have arrived. The current situation of raw cotton is as follows:

### Statistics on the Production of Shanghai Silk Factories

— Shi Xiang

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all industries have suffered huge losses. The Chinese silk industry, which was on the rise, has suffered an unprecedented catastrophe, which is deeply painful to hear. In recent years, the Chinese government has recognized that silk is an important export commodity for our country, so it has spared no effort in promoting and supervising it. In addition, our silk workers have made great improvements, so the products are very refined. Shanghai is the hub of foreign trade, so the government has established a silk inspection bureau. All Chinese silk for export must undergo strict inspection before being allowed to be transported to Europe and the United States. Therefore, foreign merchants and foreign firms only need to purchase silk that has passed the inspection bureau, and they are happy to purchase it and trust it very much.

Now, the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have fallen one after another. The silk industry is controlled by the Japanese puppets. All material economy is being used. Last year, the so-called "Central China Company" in Wuxi made a profit of 7 million yuan. There are two reasons for such a harvest:

The sales in Europe and the United States have improved, and the price of silk has soared as a result;

Confiscate the dry cocoons stored in the factories of Chinese manufacturers.

Now there are 14 silk factories in Wuxi that are forced to be controlled by them, with 4,852 machines. They are still continuing to invade. Legitimate merchants cannot stand on their feet and have to set up factories in Shanghai. From April of last year to the present, according to the most accurate statistics in the silk industry, there are 37 factories, 20 of which are distributed in the concession area, and 17 in the Shanghai West Cross-Border area. The total number of machines is 5,835, and 70% of the total number of machines (ie, 4,084) are working night shifts. Therefore, there are less than 10,000 silk machines in Shanghai, and the monthly silk production is more than 3,100 piculs. We calculate that four piculs of dry cocoons are used to produce one picul of raw silk, so the monthly use of dry cocoons is 12,400 piculs. If the factory is open all year round, the Shanghai silk factory must store 150,000 piculs of raw materials to maintain it. The above statistics are based on 18 taels of silk per machine per day. As for the speed of work and the amount of production, it depends on the internal management of each factory. The current silk production is listed below: (The unit of measurement is jin)

### Yarn and Cloth

Cantonese Merchants Continue to Purchase, Yarn Prices Fluctuate, Double Horse and Celestial Maiden Remain Firmly High

The yarn market remains firm and the momentum is very high. Although the prices rose yesterday, the demand from the Hua Nan, Hong Kong, and Chao Shan gangs continued unabated. As a result, people are more optimistic, and colleagues and practitioners have purchased in large quantities, with the purchase amount being more than double the sales. The market transactions are unusually complicated, but the changes in the market prices of Double Horse and Celestial Maiden are very rapid, and are generally regarded as the standard by operators. Therefore, when the market tightens, the increase in force is twice as high as that of other yarns. However, the price difference between the remaining medium-sized 20-count new brand yarns is still far away. However, in terms of fact, the selling price of unpopular goods is inevitable is too cheap.

In the current yarn situation, the market opened in the morning, due to the strong market atmosphere yesterday, the people's minds were still firm and high, and the Shantou gang and the Guangdong gang all had purchases, so the selling prices were all increased by three or four yuan. The spot price of 20-count Celestial Maiden goods was 436 yuan, and the price of Double Horse was 435 yuan. However, the price of the stack order was not as good as the spot goods, and the Double Horse stack order was 423 yuan, and there were few customers. Soon, the actual sales volume of customers was good, and the selling sound in the market suddenly vibrated, and the price fell by five yuan. The spot price of Celestial Maiden goods was 431-2 yuan, the price of Double Horse fell to 429 yuan, and the price of the stack order fell to 417 yuan. In the afternoon, the Wanxinghao of the Guangdong gang suddenly came to collect one or two hundred bales of Double Horse stack orders, and the price suddenly rose by two or three yuan, to 421.5 yuan, but the spot goods transaction was not strong, and it also traded at 433 yuan. It is found that the statistics of each gang's purchase amount throughout the day were 2,440 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 3 yuan, the price of Celestial Maiden rose by 4 yuan, and the others were about the same as yesterday. The factory opened 100 bales of 16-count Double Dragon goods from Zhenhua Factory, and the price was 372 yuan. Today, five pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xinghua. The amount of each gang's purchase is as follows:

|  Colleagues | 1,320 |
|---|---|
| Yunnan | 20 |
| Mainland | 180 |
| Shantou | 455 |
| Hong Kong | 415 |
| Hunan | 20 |
| Statistics | 2,440 |

The Japanese yarn market is becoming increasingly weak. There are two reasons for this: Since the squeeze of the shorts last month, the sellers have been damaged and the volume of transactions has decreased. After the prices soared, the actual needs were lacking, and after the squeeze of the Qingdao Exchange, the holders of the goods sold out one after another, and the market relaxed. Therefore, it is said that the Qingdao market price is not working recently, and it is not as high as Shanghai's. Today, the closing price of 20-count Moon Harp yarn was 368 yuan, down 3 yuan from the previous day.

### Indian Cotton Shipped to China in Nine Months 180,000 Bales

Nearly Half of India's Exports

### Piece Goods

Sichuan Merchants Transport Stocks, Quantity Greatly Increased, Eastern Piece Goods Fall Along with Tianjin and Qingdao

National Cloth

Yesterday's market trend was peaceful. The current sales of white goods were more active with the Yunnan gang and the local streets. It is estimated that the Yunnan gang handled one hundred and several tens of pieces of rough cloth from Dasheng, Xinyu and other factories. The local streets continued to search for cheap rough cloth. The transaction involved one hundred and several tens of bales of Jardine Matheson goods of various weights. The dyeing factory handled seventy-eighty bales of Pao Che fine cloth and miscellaneous brand fine twill. The spot market price of each piece of gapped stalls has been slightly raised by one dime. For example, Pao Che was previously sold for 14 yuan, but it rose to 14.1 yuan yesterday. The spot price of 14.75 yuan for Da Peng fine cloth was sold out. Now that the spot goods are tightened, the market price is again shouting 15 yuan. The bleaching and dyeing cloth is stable. Transactions in the local streets near the road and the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are still in a constant flow. The quantity of stocks shipped out of the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs in Shanghai has increased greatly in recent days. The new goods are two thousand and several hundred pieces of standard color cloth and color twill handled by the Sichuan gang.

Eastern Piece Goods

Yesterday, the white fine cloth and fine satin market was weaker than before, due to telegrams from Tianjin and Qingdao, the local market prices have fallen. The market emptiers also exerted pressure. In the early morning, the price of each piece suddenly dropped by two dimes. In the afternoon, it was heard that the North gang handled more than six hundred bales of fine cloth of various brands. The local street dyeing factory and colleagues also adopted six-seven hundred pieces. The market situation has slightly stabilized. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth has fallen back to 13.75 yuan, but the foreign firms have not yet opened the goods. This is because the distance between the line price and the current price is still far away and cannot be approached.

Export

On the 11th, sixty-one pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, twenty-eight pieces were shipped to Xinghua on the 12th, and six pieces were shipped to Quanzhou.

### Grains and Food

Actual Sales are Sluggish, Flour Market is Mediocre

Yesterday, the factory price of the flour market was still shouting 4.55 yuan in cash, but the market transactions were gradually decreasing. The reason is that the sales of the Northern Ocean gang are very weak. This is mainly due to the exchange rate relationship and the influence of the local foreign flour squeeze. Therefore, the purchase intention is sluggish, and the Nanyang gang also has few sales. They only rely on sporadic activities in the local streets and inland areas. It is heard that the floating miscellaneous brand flour has depreciated by 5 cents, but the factory is unwilling to reduce the price to sell out due to the current high costs. Therefore, the market is still in a state of support. The total turnover of the market is less than 30,000 bales, and the market situation has shown signs of obvious stabilization and hidden relaxation. It is found that the export of flour has reached 10,300 bales today, shipped to Yuhua, and another 17,700 bales, shipped to Quanzhou.

The foreign flour market is still stable. According to foreign telecommunications, the wheat-producing areas in the United States and Canada are continuing to experience drought, and the price of foreign flour is firm and high. The futures transaction is silent, and the supply of current foreign flour is also scarce. A large batch of arrivals have been directly transshipped to other ports. There are only a few sellers in the market, and the price of the goods in the general market is about 4.5 yuan, but the holders of the goods intend to wait for a good price to sell out, so the market is still in a state of support.

### Local Wheat is Purchased by Japanese Merchants

Yesterday's wheat market was also looser. The reason is that in the midst of the recent foreign flour orders arriving in Shanghai, the environment of local wheat is very bad. The factory's purchase intention is lazy, and they intend to suppress the price to take it. Therefore, the selling price of the goods sent to the factory has been repeatedly loosened. Yesterday's formal transaction in the market was still in a bind. It is heard that Japanese flour mills purchased more than 200 bales of Wuxi wheat, and the price was only 6.3 yuan. There are also several hundred bales of Gaomai in Jiangbei, and the price is 6.5 yuan to 4.5 yuan.

### Northern Japonica Rice is Sold in Combination with Middle-Class Customers

Yesterday, the sources of each gang, He Xia, arrived at Nangang No. 3, Liantang No. 5, Huangqiao No. 3, Liudaowan No. 3, Chelin Baozi Suzhou gang 1,4500 bales, Changzhou gang 125 bales. There were slightly more goods on the market than before. This is because the northern japonica rice has been heavier in recent days and has not been sampled at all. Now, it is mostly sold in combination with middle-class customers, so it is quite pushed out. Although the northern japonica rice market still maintains the limit line, the customer tip has been raised by 20-30 cents invisibly. Since the southern gang japonica rice has been on the market every day, the transaction is limited, but the high-quality and thin rice is still rare. In fact, if the price of He Xia Liantang goods is opened at 14.5 yuan, the deduction of commission and the addition of bag leather are more advanced than the high-quality goods. In this situation where the Jing and Wei are not distinguished, there is a lack of high-quality goods on the market. Dujian opened 15 yuan, Yangjian lacked goods, and the market was filled with Yang glutinous rice, which also opened at 21 yuan, and Yang glutinous rice, such as Hong Kong goods, also opened at 19.5 yuan.

### Wu Xian Wheel Transport Suffers Obstacles, Pricey Zhaoyuan Goods, Foreign Glutinous Rice from Hong Kong

After Wu Xian returned to the flat yesterday, the store sales were even more prosperous yesterday, so the morning market has seen a prosperous scene. However, after the merchants received a telegram from Wuhu, saying that the rice stored in the area suddenly encountered unexpected obstacles when loading the wheel yesterday, and the rice to be transported could not be loaded as much as possible, so the merchants' minds were upward, and the selling price immediately increased by 10-20 cents. The stores were even more greedy in the afternoon, and the market price increased by another 10 cents. After Gao Xian reached the limit price of 14 yuan, he had to sell out with the middle-class rice, so the middle-class machine white and white were even more attractive, and the increase was also satisfactory. The total turnover increased to more than 8,000 bales.

Foreign rice orders are not cost-effective, stocks are dry and sales are weak, and Saigon is still shouting 19.12 yuan, but new foreign glutinous rice has been loaded from Hong Kong (and another 2,240 bales of rice have arrived from Hong Kong on the 11th), and Ke Yuan has also been shipped from Wuhu, which is attracted by the high local market price. Wu Yuan rice is opened at 19 yuan, and Wu glutinous rice is around 19 yuan.

### Oil Cake, Soybean Oil has Many Sources, Market Price Drops by 2 Yuan

Although the soybean oil market continued the momentum of the previous day, the actual sales in various places had already absorbed enough before the busy farming season. The new rapeseed oil is about to enter the market, so the sales are quite sluggish. In addition to the direct and indirect transportation from the producing area to Shanghai, the current source also has transshipments arriving in Shanghai from Fuzhou, Hong Kong, etc., which has gradually increased the bargaining chips in the market. There are currently more than 12,000 barrels of barrel soybean oil, more than 4,000 pieces of basket oil, and more than 3,000 cans of canned oil. According to the above situation, there is no opportunity for speculators, so the excitement of the previous day has dissipated, and the market price has fallen by 2 yuan. Dalian oil has fallen from 39 yuan to 38 yuan, and only 70 barrels have been traded. Yanqi oil opened 390 pieces, and the price was 17.3 yuan to 27 yuan.

In addition, 370 cans of soybean oil were shipped from Tianjin yesterday, and another 120 pieces were shipped from Yantai. Eighty pieces of cottonseed oil came from Tianjin.

In addition, 480 bales of soybeans were shipped to Xinghua, another 550 bales were shipped to Quanzhou, and 8,300 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Xinghua.

### Medicinal Materials, Fennel is Flat and Weak

Anise, the sales of anise have been sporadic recently, and the market situation has been flat. In addition, a certain number has transported a batch of Beihai goods, which are withered and damp, and their price is 20 yuan lower than that of high-quality goods. There has been a transaction. It is found that there are more than 200 bales of goods stored in the merchants here, and they are not without being affected. It is estimated that the customers are afraid to enter lightly due to the cheap goods in front of them, resulting in a sluggish situation.

### Old Tai

— Sheng Dan

——Battlefield Reminiscences

The Han River flows east, the sun sets,
Atop the tower, wine cup, trying to dispel sorrows;
Pitiable are the roads by Parrot Isle,
Meeting you in traveler's garb, then bidding you farewell again.

Autumn has descended upon the world, but Hankou is still enveloped in a heatwave. Indeed, after lunch, the indoor thermometer often reads above ninety degrees, making one truly sweat like rain. "Didn't you say you were going to Parrot Isle? Old Tai is waiting there!" Shi Jianxiong suddenly rushed in from outside, urging me in this way. He had just broken through from Xuzhou and returned. He was scheduled to rest in Wuchang for a few days before departing with his troops to Xianning; and Shu Yunpeng of the Ministry of Transportation's battlefield service group would soon be leaving Hankou for Hunan. So Old Tai specially chose that "fragrant grasses luxuriant" famous scenic spot to have a temporary farewell meal.

Speaking of Old Tai, one immediately feels an unspeakable joy. After returning from France, he taught at Zanda University, just like his brother Shuangqiu. He always wore a set of blue work clothes, was tall and lanky, and ran a bit like Charlie Chaplin. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War until the retreat of the National Army, he was determined to learn from Ban Dingyuan. "Be patient! A bookworm like you still wants to abandon your pen for a sword!" His wife teased, seemingly indicating that she wasn't very trusting. "Then watch out!" Old Tai protested. Before long, he received a telegram from General Zhang Fakui, asking him to immediately set off for Ruichang, fulfilling his wish. When I met him on Jianghan Road, he was already fully armed and about to depart for the battlefield.

Life on the battlefield is naturally not "carefree," but you realize that you are participating in a great era, and you feel very happy; moreover, for the sake of the motherland, any of the highest material enjoyment can be completely sacrificed. Old Tai resolutely rejected the appointment from Guizhou Xiada University and went to serve on the front lines. Who says intellectuals shouldn't do this?

When we arrived at Parrot Isle, everyone was dripping with sweat. Old Tai and others had already arrived. We each took out the farewell wine and food we had brought and feasted upstairs in a tea shop. Jianxiong talked at length about his victory in Taierzhuang, eloquently; and solemnly took out a photo of General Li Zongren for us to admire. The photo was taken on the platform of the Taierzhuang Railway Station. General Li stood before the station name sign, looking spirited and awe-inspiring.

The sun was about to set when we said goodbye to Parrot Isle. Old Tai knew that I could compose a few old poems, so he insisted on "repaying" him with one. Under the pressure of this modern Ban Dingyuan, I casually hummed the preceding quatrain.

### Encounter

— Sun Zhenming

After a barrage of brutal interrogation, he was led into this dark iron prison by several burly men.

It was so cramped and suffocating, crowded with a large group of prisoners. As soon as he entered, he almost tripped over a foot sticking out. Feeling his way forward, he sat down in a space between people. He felt his brain expanding frantically, every pore on his skin seeming to burst. A sharp pain, then numbness, he bit down on his teeth subconsciously; his eyes gradually blurred and dimmed, the world seemed to be spinning. Finally, he passed out.

A sharp pain woke him up again. He looked around, still a pitch black. Many voices were moaning softly. A vague shadow swept through his mind, silently sinking into memory.

One noon, he was about to leave the office when suddenly Captain Wang Zhongwen rushed over and whispered to him:

"Jin Gang, there's another task I need you to do now. If you succeed, we'll have even more strength."

"What is it?" He looked at Captain Wang.

Captain Wang immediately brought his mouth close to his ear:

"Although we have several hundred comrades now, we only have thirty or forty guns. Under the paved road in front of the ×× Elementary School gate in Town C, there are more than fifty short guns buried. They were left behind when the army retreated before. Now we're sending you to find a way to transport them out. As for how to transport them, figure it out when you get there." Captain Wang raised his head, looked at the blue sky, and continued urgently: "Go tonight, it's good that you're familiar with the situation in Town C."

So, in the dim twilight, he arrived at Town C, stayed at a friend's house, and began his activities.

Two weeks later, he led a group of enthusiastic young porters and sneaked into the uninhabited school in the dark, starting the difficult work. The river next to the paved road shimmered with dark light in the night. A fishing boat was quietly waiting, urging them to dig even harder.

Using the light of the moon and stars, they dug and dug in the dark, the soil piled up several feet high, and a long and wide wooden plank was discovered. Underneath it was a pile of dark guns. Countless eyes began to reveal waves of joy and pleasure, and they used all their strength to tie up the guns one by one and carry them to the fishing boat parked by the river. The partners waiting on the fishing boat loaded the guns onto the boat and covered them with cloth.

The fishing boat began to move in the river. Reflected in the light of the stars and moon, the outline of the town was dreaming soundly.

All around, faintly, a sound of oars came from the opposite side. In a moment, several strong beams of light shone on their boat. Harsh voices shouted:

"What are you doing? Don't move!"

Before the partners could reveal their weapons, the other party had jumped onto the boat, and Jin Gang and his partners were taken to the puppet police station in succession. Before the interrogation, they were beaten brutally by the men in yellow uniforms stationed in the puppet police station. Fresh red blood spurted from the swollen skin, turning into long, brownish-purple welts, dripping down their bodies. After the beating, they were taken one by one to the interrogation room, where several hideous men in yellow uniforms and puppet officials sat high above, showing contemptuous sneers.

"You still won't confess?" The voice floated in the air. Jin Gang stood calmly and solemnly, silently pondering. After a while, the side door of the interrogation room opened lightly, and a young man in plain clothes walked out arrogantly, looking surprised when he saw Jin Gang!

"Oh, it's Brother Jin Gang! What crime did you commit?"

He looked up and saw that the person standing in front of him was Yang Yimin, a former classmate.

"Brother Jin Gang, joined the guerrillas? Haha! What a boring business..."

Countless sparks burst from Jin Gang's eyes. Before Yang Yimin could finish speaking, he rushed towards him in one breath. Yang Yimin was caught off guard and tripped.

After that, Jin Gang was dragged down by several burly men and beaten brutally, fainting and waking up, waking up and fainting again, several times in a row. His whole body was covered with swollen skin, and he was pushed into this iron prison.

He missed the young porters and boatmen, and he missed his many comrades. In this way, he endured the trials and tribulations in prison, waiting for the opportunity to break through the wall and fly away.

### Mr. Zhang's Bravery

— He Han

### Face

— Geng Zhi

Even foreigners, no, Westerners, say that Chinese people pay the most attention to face. This statement can be interpreted in two ways: positively, China is a land of etiquette, and everyone cares about their reputation, especially face, refusing to do evil and be laughed at; negatively, it means only caring about face and not the "inside," the reality, thus delaying many important matters.

What Westerners say is probably right. However, the face we often see seems to be mostly the negative kind, which is truly lamentable. Isn't it so: in the past, those who could walk around in government offices were considered to have face; those who could get free tickets and sit in first-class trains or luxury steamships were considered to have face; those who could run over someone with a car, pay some money, and avoid lawsuits were considered to have face... Now, extravagant weddings and funerals, wasteful and harmful to the people and money, are considered to have face... There are so many, I can't list them all.

Why do they want such face? In a word, it's nothing more than wanting to gain some vanity and hear people praising them. So those who have no face, or whose face is not big enough, spare no effort to climb up; either attaching themselves to powerful figures to rise to prominence, or clinging to the tails of successful people to travel far. The more shrewd ones even use the method of "swelling their faces to look like a fat person." Because fat people are prosperous people, how impressive they are when they walk in front of people, while those who are sallow and thin can only look on in despair. There's no choice but to wrong their cheeks and swell them up for show. Master Yan from the Kaishan Prince's mansion was willing to have Master Zou beat him until his face was black and blue, so that he could win the "imperial lawsuit" (suing before the emperor) and regain face, which can also be considered such a shrewd method.

Since face is so precious; those who don't have it spare no "capital" to get it, and those who already have it naturally refuse to give it up easily, even "wanting" it until "death." So, under the important motive of preserving face, many wonderful things happen:

Clearly afraid of fighting, they roll up their sleeves and shout, "Come on, come on!" But when the other person rushes forward, they turn around and run away, saying in a serious warning tone, "Don't run if you have the guts, wait for me to call my brother!" This way, face is preserved.

Clearly afraid of their wives, they say, "Don't be naughty." Kneeling to their wives, they say they are "learning to kowtow during the New Year." Ren Xiang of the Tang Dynasty put it even better, using "living Bodhisattva," "nine-child mother," and "Kumbhanda" to explain why even Ziwen had to be afraid. This way, face is preserved.

There are countless such everyday matters. Zhao Tuo, the King of Nanyue in the Han Dynasty, "just amusing himself," and Ruan Zhongrong of the Jin Dynasty, "unable to avoid vulgarity, just doing this," can all be included in this category, showing that preserving face has been important for a long time.

I think the person who was best at preserving face in ancient times can be considered Meng Zhifan. After being defeated in battle and fleeing for his life, he had one of his chariots fall behind, indicating that he was "holding the line alone" and "covering the retreat," which was already very clever. When entering the city gate, he even "whipped his horse and said, 'It's not that I dared to be behind, but the horse wouldn't go forward,'" further indicating that he didn't need face. This was so clever that even Confucius repeatedly praised him for his "not boasting." In fact, he was "boasting" again and again, in my opinion.

Writing this, perhaps some people think I'm ridiculing face and don't approve of it. That's not entirely true. I naturally approve of positive face, "I have no complaints." Even for negative face, I think; before the Three Dynasties, people were afraid of liking face too much; after the Three Dynasties, they were afraid of not liking face enough: wanting face is always better than male thieves and female prostitutes, doing anything without scruples.

Nowadays, there are too many "shameless" people who are "burned and battered but insist on 'standing' tall," and there are also many "ghoulish faces" that "block" human spirit and "stir up" trouble. They are all brave men who are not afraid of the stench of blood when killing, truly making me miss face even more! Even knowing it's "fake," I think, why worry!

### The Solitary Stroll

— Wall Creeper

I've always enjoyed strolling. To say "enjoy," though, is not generally in the manner that health experts recommend as beneficial exercise for body and mind. In truth, it's because I have too much free time; when I'm in a good mood, I simply wander off, and slowly it's turned into a habit. When one comes to a habit, one often does it unconsciously and automatically. For me, strolling is a good example.

I mostly take my strolls late at night. Because during the day, there are more vehicles on the streets, and the crowds are more packed. Where vehicles pass, they kick up dust and sand, which hits you right in the nose and mouth, making it difficult to breathe. Late at night—or at dusk, too—vehicles are scarce, and the crowds are thin, so you can go back and forth more freely, without bumping into people's shoulders or having people trample on your shoes, which would make a leisurely mood anxious and restless, and defeat the original purpose of the stroll.

I don't like strolling with many people together, because its interest is no longer based on the stroll itself. Even on a small point, the fact that everyone's pace is different can create a lot of trouble in the mind. However, I do like strolling with two people together, as long as the other person truly understands the pleasure of strolling. But, in fact, I'm often alone; it's just me, myself.

Therefore, I laugh at myself for being a solitary stroller.

Because I stroll so much, I've become familiar with so many streets that are suitable for strolling, mostly relatively quiet ones, but not desolate. I walk slowly on them, always muttering to myself, like a poet struggling to compose a masterpiece. In fact, sometimes I don't think about anything at all, and I don't pay attention to the things around me at all; or I have some feelings, some awareness. I think of myself as belonging to another world, and I also think of the whole world as belonging exclusively to me. But when I realize that my body is originally in the human world, in the things that are usually overlooked in the rush, I calmly try to emphasize my observation and discover the fun in them. I will linger under dazzling neon lights and eye-catching shop windows, moving my gaze, silently enjoying the beauty of the colors and structures of various goods. I will follow behind women with elegant charm to satisfy my feeling of comfort. Yes, I will also feel this kind of boredom, so I often urgently need to meet an acquaintance. Even if it's someone I've met only briefly, I will greet them and cast a joyful glance. Naturally, I even more need a friendly handshake, a heart-to-heart conversation; my soul will be warmed by this.

But the streets are like the ocean; in the vast ocean, I and the crowds are strangers.

The night is deep. People have gone to sleep. There's only me on this street.

Looking at the stars in the sky. I think with a sense of something gained and something lost, like a philosopher trying to understand the secrets of the universe.

Friend, you want to ask me, what am I thinking about?

I tell you, I miss the suburbs. How wonderful it would be to take a solitary stroll in the suburbs. I want to rush to the suburbs! (Charity Sale Donation)

### Completion of the Chastity Hall

(See this newspaper from May of the 11th year of the Xuantong Era)

Yu Xisheng, Zhu Qi'ang, and others in Shanghai established the Chastity Hall to build houses and take in widows, as well as elderly unmarried women, and allow them to bring their children. Due to insufficient funding, it is tentatively limited to one hundred people. All rules and regulations follow the provincial regulations, with appropriate additions and subtractions. The establishment of the hall required considerable funding, and fortunately, with the efforts of officials and merchants, construction was completed. Upon inspection, only widows under the age of thirty are eligible for admission. Elderly unmarried women who are brought along must be genuinely infirm and unable to support themselves, or destitute and without support, and only after investigation are they allowed to be admitted together. A report has been submitted to the county magistrate requesting that he order the bailiffs and neighborhood chiefs that all eligible widows, whether from other provinces or local, be allowed to report to the hall through a guarantor for investigation and admission.

### Fundraising for the Renji Hospital

The establishment of the Renji Hospital in Shanghai has been a long-standing endeavor. The number of people seeking treatment is increasing day by day, and the cost of operation is increasing day by day. Previous donations are insufficient, and it is now proposed to launch another widespread fundraising campaign to raise funds. Each merchant house, with its benevolent nature, will donate ten silver dollars.

### Decoration of Opium Dens

The number and exquisiteness of opium dens in the Shanghai Concession are truly the best in the world. Even the names are elegant, often using the character "cloud" to convey the meaning of inhaling and exhaling smoke, such as Mianyun, Aiyun, Huiyun, Ruiyun Pavilions, as well as Wanliyun, Wanyunxian, Xiaoyunting, and the like. The style of the facade is almost like that of shops selling pearls, mao, ginseng, which can be described as extravagant and magnificent! Furthermore, Tian Shengxiang on Baoshan Street has a couplet inside that reads: "A life of savoring sour and salty outside the cauldron, pure bliss in the clouds providing sustenance." and "Hibiscus knows only intoxication when autumn arrives, willows only know sleep when spring comes." The intentions are quite novel.

Tomorrow's issue will include: British Envoy's Audience with the Japanese Emperor, French Commissioner's Arrival in Tianjin, Flying Bird Wrestling

### Preview of the Invitation Exhibition

— Mu Zhong

Huang Xing's obituary jointly signed by Sun Wen and six others, three old-style obituaries listing the deceased's official titles, Wang Fen and Luo Hong's engagement invitation with a unique style, Chiang Kai-shek's guest invitation also displayed in the exhibition

An invitation is a very ordinary social document, but due to changes in the times, differences in customs, different formats, and different changes, careful research can also be used to discern the social dynamics and etiquette of the time, and can also be used as a kind of textual research data in the history of human evolution.

Recently, this city is going to prepare an invitation exhibition, the location is scheduled to be in the Ningbo Hometown Association, and it is still in the process of soliciting and collecting. This can be said to be an unprecedented initiative. The day before yesterday, the association merged the various items that had been slightly obtained with the photography of the Silver Money Industry Friendship Association and displayed them in the latter's clubhouse as a pre-exhibition. It is said that only one percent of the entire exhibition is displayed, but it is dazzling and there are no less than seven or eight hundred points.

Among the obituaries, the most meaningful is Huang Xing's obituary. The writing style of this obituary is very special. Those who came forward were not the orphaned sons and daughters, but his six friends: Sun Wen, Tang Shaoyi, Li Liejun, Cai Yuanpei, Bo Wenwei, and Tan Renfeng. A small card listed brief sentences, with the names of his four sons and three daughters listed in the upper left corner, but without any titles. The association also specially collected a posthumous photo of Mr. Huang Xing and placed it together in a frame, which made visitors pay great attention. This can be said to be the most historically valuable invitation in the entire exhibition.

Secondly, there are three old-style obituaries, using folded yellow paper, printed with large-sized woodcut Song characters, listing a very long length. Among them, the obituaries of Li Zhongxian and Zhang Xiaosong mostly describe the official titles of the person themselves. As for the name of the deceased, it will not be seen until after six or seven pages. This shows the deceased's honor; the official positions that have been experienced are often arranged redundantly, and even the calligraphy, candy, and medicines bestowed by the Qing Dynasty emperors are recorded as a matter of pride. There is also an obituary from Hadong, which refers to "British European Si Ai Hadong," with "chief mourner wife Luo Jialing" and "funeral director adopted brother Ji Juemi" coming forward, and many inner-surname adopted sons and daughters are listed. This obituary format is very unique and not commonly seen.

Other noteworthy items include: Zhu Zhongxian's obituary, decorated with calligraphy and painting, and arranged like a page of publication; Zheng Zhengqiu's biography, a page of text accompanied by several pictures from different eras; and Zhou Yusheng's father's obituary, which used black cardboard pieces for taking photos, printed with silver characters, which was both eye-catching and extremely mourning, with a very unique format.

Among the wedding invitations, the more special one is the engagement invitation of Wang Fen and Luo Hong. Both of them are artists, so the style of the sentences is also unique. Now copy it below: Brilliant clouds decorate youth; The passion of youth will pull us together; Pulling hand in hand on the road of life, running wildly and not stopping! Arrowhead-like advance; Let's move forward and cut through thorns together.

We two are united as permanent partners due to the harmony of our emotions, the commonality of our wills, and the consent of our families, and will formally engage on a certain day, month, and year. Wang Fen Luo Hong, jointly opens

The wedding tie is intricate, which is very troublesome. There are formal implementations of simplicity. Yu Zhengcai and Lu Qian Gui's wedding invitations solemnly note the words "no gifts, no banquets", and on the back it explains "why we want to implement frugal marriage and eradicate the custom of sending gifts", listing the reasons a little bit, and finally reaffirming the purpose of the two: "Work hard, strive, be self-reliant, be pragmatic, and seek progress day by day in everything... " This wedding invitation can be said to be a practical example of eradicating hypocrisy and human sentiment. There are also those who send out invitations after the wedding, using sentences like: "We have both certified our hearts, willing to go well forever, married on a certain day, month, and year, respectfully report with reverence. One

There are those who are happy to turn the words around, and when their children get engaged and send out wedding tea, they also attach a card with four or six sentences printed on it; "It is said that the marriage ceremony is important, preparing six to propose marriage; the couple's way is respected, dividing the names of the three cardinal guides... May they be harmonious and respectful in the years to come, and may their love last as long as Liang Meng: Glad that this day is auspicious for the phoenix, and I am comforted by my private feelings."

There are also the wedding invitations presented by Mr. Zhou Bangjun of the Sino-Western Pharmacy, all taking the same format. Regardless of whether it is a child's wedding, the first page of the wedding invitation is always a picture with a very "auspicious" meaning, the second page is the invitation text, the third is a photo and resume of the new couple, and the fourth page is the wedding section, which can be said to be a very complete wedding invitation format.

The remaining ordinary invitations include: Ambassador Kong's invitation to England, with the names of as many as 112 people; General Chiang's guest invitation style; the opening invitation of the Central Bank; and the invitation format of Philip, all of which are very noteworthy.

Funeral and mourning notices, like eulogies, epitaphs, family biographies, etc., were arranged like books on a long table, the words inside were very rich, so I will not copy them one by one.

In addition, there are many New Year's cards, with many colors, dazzling and eye-catching, unlike wedding invitations and obituaries, which are so monotonous, and are mainly based on pictures, some of which are taken from various flowers, some of which are people, and some of which are Christmas candles.

At the last exhibition, there were also several business cards and envelopes left by senior officials of the Qing Dynasty, Su, Song, and Tai, who visited the Shanghai bishop. The business cards at that time were all made of large magenta paper, with the name printed in the middle, and words written in the blank space, which became a letter of announcement. Comparing our current business cards with it, we feel that the format of this kind of card is very clumsy and has been eliminated.

After a hasty visit, I felt that the format and wording of the invitations were very peculiar and interesting, and it is also something worthy of being collected and preserved by collectors.

### The latest U.S. Issued Refugee Relief Stamps for China

— (Translated from Millard's Review Weekly by Zong Guang)

The stamp above is one of the newest United States Post Office refugee relief stamps for China. The first to see it was on a letter a certain Westerner received last week from a friend from New York, postmarked March 11. The design is very eye-catching and beautiful.

After the outbreak of the war in China, the United States repeatedly donated money, medicine, etc. This time, the issuance of this kind of relief stamp will undoubtedly enhance the friendship between China and the United States.

This kind of relief stamp was first advocated by the church side, requesting to hold it, and now it has been formally issued by the United States Postal Authority.

Ninth episode: Shedding Tears in Sorrow and Enduring Hardships, Practicing Thrift, and Studying Diligence

Although this Freedom Village has a new atmosphere, it has also cultivated a kind of thrifty and simple folk customs. Everyone said that this was the achievement of Village Chief Zhu. Those who go to Freedom Village, at first glance, see the neatness of the roads. On both sides of the road, there are not many houses, but the trees are planted very well. At this moment, when they came, it was also gradually late autumn, but the trees on the roadside were still lush green. Looking out from the shade of the trees, there were endless rice fields. Village Chief Zhu's idea is that the villagers here have always been farmers, and now they still take farming as the foundation. We must not think that since that kind of industry has developed recently, we should see something different and want to move away from our main business and move to another business. Planting people are still planting fields, so Village Chief Zhu has two nephews who used to be farmers, and now they are still farmers. Even his grandnephew, although he studied at an agricultural school, can still go to the fields during busy farming seasons. However, modern agriculture cannot adhere to old rules, Village Chief Zhu is not unaware of this concept. The reason why agriculture in China could not develop in the past is that for hundreds of thousands of years, the same method was used, and it is still the same method now. You should know that all businesses in the world are like running races. People have run fast to the front, but you are still lingering behind. How can you not lose out? Because collective farms have been popular in recent agriculture, the farmland in Freedom Village has also become collective farms. Because the slogan of farm mechanization has been instilled into the minds of every farmer since China's post-war reconstruction. People have machines for planting fields, but we don't. People with machines, how much labor is needed for ten acres of land? We have no machines, but how much labor is needed for ten acres of land? This is obvious, and even the most foolish villagers can see it. But why can't we also equip ourselves with field planting machines like others? That is because our farmers are poor and have no power to buy machines. For example, a family in the countryside only has ten acres of land, and they often end up eating before they plant. To the point that they have to borrow money to develop agriculture. Meeting those who charge high interest rates and exploit the marrow and blood of farmers, regardless of whether it is three or four points of interest, scraping the blood and sweat of the planters, may I ask if they still have the spare power to prepare field planting machines? Now that it has become a collective farm, you don't need to invest alone. It is easy for everyone to raise together. Even if the machine is slightly more expensive, you can still get it done. Moreover, there are now local farmers' banks that have established agricultural cooperatives, and they lend money to farmers at very low interest rates. (107)

### "A Patriot's Heart"

— Jiang Shu

"Man's Heritage"

"A Patriot's Heart," like all films glorifying military academies, depicts the strict discipline of military schools and the loyalty of youth to their country. In the present time, when aggressors are intensifying their oppression of weaker nations, I feel that the repeated production of Hollywood military school films has the same significance as recalling the Pacific Fleet. "A Patriot's Heart" further emphasizes the story of a military doctor who, fearing the enemy's heavy artillery fire, abandoned his post and fled. While he was in exile, the government, believing he had died in military service, posthumously awarded the family the highly honored Congressional Medal of Honor, and his son was granted free admission to military school. The natural bond between father and son, the deep love for one's offspring, but for his past mistakes and for the sake of his son's future, he can only secretly meet with his son. This is just as the advertisement says: "The son originally regarded him as an unparalleled hero, but his conscience condemns him as a shameful coward!" Therefore, the opening of "A Patriot's Heart" at this time and in this place should be given considerable attention by us.

However, it is a pity that the director was unable to handle this film more compactly and strengthen its central message. First, he lightly glossed over the process of friendship between Tom and Randolph. For example, Tom's pride and bullying of Randolph should have been skillfully dissolved in daily life until Tom learned that Randolph's father was also a fallen soldier and also missed his own father, which led them to hold hands intimately. Here, the director used Randolph's unrequited love for a singer, which caused him to miss roll call, and Tom covered for him. The director may have thought that this would alleviate the monotony of military school life and further complement the friendship between Tom and Randolph. In fact, the scene where the students discovered Randolph's secretly hidden photo of the singer was already lively enough. Tom's covering for him only undermined the discipline of the military school.

Second, he did not powerfully portray the shame and inner pain of the fleeing military officer. The two scenes where the father and son meet are also not powerful enough. For example, in the second scene, he used a thunderstorm as a backdrop, which was indeed a clever technique, but in the scenes of Alan visiting Tom at night, Tom rushing to the inn, and Randolph driving to track them down, he failed to achieve the expected effect because of his weak skills.

The best scene is still when the students are celebrating Christmas. One student receives a telegram of his mother's death, and the contrast between the liveliness and the sorrow is handled very well.

In the final graduation ceremony, the camera zooms in on a close-up of the Peace Memorial Hall, which teaches those "people" who shout "mutually assured destruction" what the true meaning of "peace" is! (Yi Jia献金)

### World Celebrities and Movies

— (De Gang)

Mussolini loved watching movies, and he also had a very strange habit, which was that he didn't like reading movie reviews. He believed that movie reviews were the most worthless kind of work. In order to comply with the Prime Minister's wishes, movie reviews could not be found in Italian newspapers and magazines.

Hitler's interest in movies was also not weak, but he only liked watching films made in Germany.

The King and Queen of England also loved watching movies. The King had his own movie room in Sandringham Palace. Although the equipment was not very sophisticated, the films shown were the newest and best. On average, one film was shown every week, and the audience included the King and Queen, Queen Mary, and other members of the royal family.

The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, also loved movies. He recently watched the film "Pygmalion" with the President of France, Lebrun.

U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife also had a great interest in movies. Roosevelt's eldest son, James Roosevelt, originally served as Roosevelt's private secretary, but is now working as a director at a film production company in Hollywood. He recently invited his parents to visit when he was directing the film "Wuthering Heights," and the Roosevelts praised it greatly.

German Aviation Minister General Göring was a movie and theater fan. He believed that the most interesting thing in the world was watching plays, so whenever he felt uncomfortable, he would go to the theater to relieve his boredom.

The great scientist Albert Einstein was not only knowledgeable in science, but also had a good understanding of film art. It was recently heard that he had been hired by a Hollywood film production company to serve as a director. Six years ago, when he visited a California film production company, he expressed his intention to join the film industry and show off his talent.

The great writer George Bernard Shaw had always disliked movies very much, so he had always refused to have his works adapted for the screen. Recently, however, he gradually felt that movies did have considerable value, so he finally agreed to have his work "Pygmalion" made into a film.

### Silhouettes of Shanghai Stars in Hong Kong (1)

— Silhouette by: Zheng Zhihang Written by: Zheng Youxuan

Zhang Yi After the outbreak of the "August 13th" battle, Zhang Yi and his lover Li Zhuozhuo ran to Hong Kong together, spending leisurely years. He originally wanted to find a way out in the Hong Kong film industry, but he didn't understand Cantonese, and there was a problem with the dialogue. This made him feel like a "hero with no place to use his talents." Therefore, in the past year, he has only acted in two films in Hong Kong: one is "Puppet Beauty," in which he co-starred with Chen Yunshang in a cameo role; the other is "A Generation of Outstanding People," in which he co-starred with Li Li from Beijing. Apart from that, there has been no other activity. On the other hand, Li Zhuozhuo, because she understands Cantonese, has been more active in the Hong Kong film industry and has gained a lot of attention.

The Brutal Acts of Warlords Killing Actors

Furthermore, everyone in the Chu family knew about her past act of donating jewelry to Lao Chu when he went out of the customs, so from the Chu old lady to the servants, everyone respected her very much. Even Chu's several wives, knowing that Lao Chu often stayed in her apartment, did not dare to compete with her for affection. One day, Lao Chu happened to meet that Ms. Chen at her house. Chen was a knowledgeable woman and could not avoid being vain. Chu and Wang were lying together smoking, and she stood aside as a junior from time to time to light a fire and pour a cup of tea, showing a lot of diligence. Of course, Lao Chu was very happy to see this. Previously, Lao Chu had not been able to figure out Wang Xiangting's psychology, fearing that she would be jealous, but who knew that Ms. Wang had already made up her mind and wanted to recommend a talented person to replace her. Seeing that both Chen and Wang were interested in each other, she took the opportunity to strongly promote their success. Chen's mother never dreamed that her daughter would become the Governor's wife. When Wang Xiangting told her, she immediately agreed. In a few days, the marriage was settled.

Generally, a woman with intelligence who wants to subdue an illiterate husband must first spend some effort to understand his temperament and temper, and then slowly grasp his power. Even signing a name or affixing a seal must be done with this female secretary. In this way, imagine that none of Chu's subordinates would be afraid of this so-called wife? Seeing that the situation had been cultivated, Chen's muscles became much stronger. Since ancient times, satiety leads to lust. After getting tired of having affairs with the adjutant, she suddenly wanted to get to know famous actors.
