### Real Power of the Chinese Army Unleashed: Japanese Troops Forced to Abandon Offensive; Fierce Battle for Batang Ends with Chinese Victory; Guerrilla Activity Behind Japanese Lines Disrupts All Roads

Guilin: The power of the Chinese army on the Yongbin Road has launched an offensive, already forcing the Japanese to abandon their attacks. The fierce battle for Batangxu has continued for three days. The Chinese army, adopting a proactive stance, has been steadily advancing, encircling the Japanese within the market town and now continuing to exert pressure with superior firepower. The movements of the Japanese army on the Yongwu Road for the past two days have been fruitless. Nearby Chinese forces still control several hilltops, maintaining a stalemate with the Japanese. The news of the Chinese army's guerrilla warfare successes behind Japanese lines has been met with great excitement here. According to battle reports, a certain unit of the Chinese army engaged a thousand Japanese soldiers between Datong and Xiaomeng, north of Qin County, for a day. By the evening of the second day, the Chinese army had captured Xiaomeng and completely destroyed the newly repaired roads between Datong and Xiaomeng by the Japanese. (4th Dispatch)

Liuzhou: Japanese troops advancing northeast from Nanning were annihilated by the Chinese near Liutang and Qitang, with nearly a thousand killed. The Japanese repeatedly sent reinforcements, using artillery cover to attack Batang again. After several assaults, over five hundred Japanese were killed. Eventually, due to overwhelming numerical disparity, the area fell into Japanese hands. On the morning of the second day, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack. Under Japanese aerial bombardment, they fought bravely in close combat, clashing for four hours. The Japanese suffered countless casualties and retreated in defeat. Batang was thus recovered. (4th Dispatch)

Chongqing: According to recent military news from the Chinese side, Chinese infantry and artillery units are rapidly deploying positions in southern Guangxi, preparing for a large-scale counteroffensive to recapture Nanning. It is reported that before launching the major offensive, the Chinese army is currently making preliminary advances on the flanks and rear of the Japanese army. Currently, one Chinese army unit has reached the outskirts of Fangcheng, while another unit, after cutting off the Nanning-Qinzhou highway, is attacking Qinzhou. Japanese aircraft continued to bomb various cities in Guangxi Province yesterday, with Binyang and Liuzhou both suffering heavy air raids. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

Guilin: Fourteen Japanese aircraft, in batches, dropped multiple bombs on Qianjiang, Liuzhou, Yulin, and other places on the fourth, morning and afternoon. (4th Dispatch)

Chongqing: A certain general in Guilin stated in a telephone conversation with a reporter from the Central News Agency this morning that the Japanese troops occupying Nanning are like entering an empty city, with no manpower or supplies available for offense or defense. Therefore, the main force of the Japanese army on the Yu River is completely trapped. Subsequently, in order to consolidate the periphery of Nanning, the Japanese risked advancing along the Yongwu and Yongbin lines and hastily repaired the Yong- Road to facilitate coordination. The Japanese troops on the Wu Road were repeatedly intercepted by the Chinese, and by the end of last week, these Japanese troops were all held back by the Chinese in the deep jungles of Dagao Peak Pass, struggling in fear and frequently looking back for reinforcements. The main force of the Japanese army on the Bin-Yong money road has been severely routed by a certain new force of the Chinese army near Batang in recent days. The Japanese are currently seeking to escape within the Chinese encirclement. At the same time, various Chinese units launched fierce attacks on the waist of the Japanese army in the Yu River area last week and completely destroyed the roads built by the Japanese. According to a recent telephone report from the front, a certain detachment of the Chinese army successively recovered several points on the Yongqin Highway, cutting off the Japanese rear route and shaking the entire line. When the reporter asked about the prospects of the war situation, he said that, overall, judging from the war situation in the past week, the total strength of the Japanese has been separated and placed by the Chinese at various points and lines, and all have fallen into the Chinese array of comprehensive mobile warfare tactics. Although the Japanese are now invading north from Yong in separate routes, the center of the entire war situation is still in the Yu River basin. Now that the Chinese army has taken control of the key to the Yu River war situation, it is judged that the Japanese army invading Guangxi this time is bound to be defeated. (4th Dispatch)

### More Than One Hundred Northern Japanese Troops Killed

Dongxiang: Japanese troops in the Fuhe and Ganjiang River areas indiscriminately shelled various locations and released poison gas, followed by small-unit advances, but were all repelled by the Chinese army. On the 30th evening, the Chinese army dispatched teams to cross the river and launch surprise attacks on Taiping Temple and Luo Jia (opposite Ren Gang) and other locations. The Japanese army was caught off guard and was attacked by the Chinese, who infiltrated the Japanese positions in Luo Jia, fiercely bombing with hand grenades and bayonets. The Japanese retreated in panic, with an estimated loss of over one hundred and twenty officers and soldiers, including Fujita Niro, and a large number of weapons, ammunition, bayonets, steel helmets, diaries, etc. were seized. A fierce battle with the Japanese lasted for two hours in the Taiping Temple area, with many Japanese killed. All then safely withdrew. (Captured Japanese Dispatch)

Editorial

### Donations and Contributions and Wartime Economy

The Ministry of Finance of the National Government recently entrusted the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks to handle various domestic and foreign donation and contribution matters. The key points are as follows: (1) This method is based on the provisions of Article 4 of the "Unified Collection and Transfer of Donations and Contributions Method" promulgated by the National Government on July 12 of this year, and is formulated by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the banks. (2) Various domestic donations and contributions are entrusted to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks for handling. (3) Various foreign contributions are entrusted to the Bank of China in Hong Kong for handling. (4) The types of donations and contributions, in addition to domestic currency, include foreign currency, gold and silver ornaments, securities, and real estate, etc., which can be valued by the bank or sold for proceeds and transferred to the government. (5) Overseas banks can receive remittances from overseas Chinese and remit them back to the country on their behalf. The Ministry of Finance's purpose in announcing this method is to facilitate domestic people and overseas Chinese who are enthusiastic about patriotism and actively contributing. In the past, the sources of China's finances were mostly customs duties, salt taxes, and land taxes. Since the fall of the coastal ports, the income from customs duties and salt taxes has been greatly reduced, and the income from land taxes has also been far less than before due to the expansion of the occupied areas. At a time when a large-scale war of resistance is underway, military strength and financial resources are the main lifelines for the country to fight abroad. Napoleon once said, "To seek victory, the most important thing is financial resources." If this was the case at that time, it is even more evident in the twentieth century that the success or failure of war depends on the abundance or scarcity of financial resources. In the past, because China's heavy industry was underdeveloped, all important weapons had to be purchased from abroad, so it was particularly necessary to raise large amounts of funds for the purchase of military supplies. In addition, the current bases of resistance, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, and Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, are more backward in industrial construction compared to the coastal provinces, and to carry out development to increase financial and economic strength for the war of resistance, a large amount of capital is also necessary. Therefore, although China's wartime financial resources can also be increased through methods such as taxes and public bonds, like other countries, and by striving to increase production and develop buried resources to generate a large amount of exports for the exchange of military supplies and other necessities, because of the large number of people mobilized, consumption is bound to be high, and the expansion of war expenses is bound to be even greater. Relying solely on normal income cannot compensate for the vast expenses, so it is necessary to rely on the people's voluntary donations and contributions to increase the country's income. In the past, China has launched several popular donation campaigns, which have achieved good results. However, the war of resistance is still in progress, and the daily cost is not small, so it is necessary to rely on long-term donations from the people. The most needed items are gold and silver ornaments, foreign currency, etc. These things, stored by individuals, were originally just for unforeseen needs, but if the country obtains them, they can become the most effective means of application. Purchasing military needs is a particularly important end. This does not result in much loss for individuals, but the contribution to the country is extremely significant. Regarding this point, we firmly believe that all Chinese people have a deep understanding.

As for the donations from overseas Chinese, they are also the most important source of international income for China. Since the outbreak of the war, the contributions of overseas Chinese to the country have been extraordinarily great. In terms of the total amount, the amount of remittances returning to the country last year reached 600 million yuan, and the amount of donations was 100 million yuan. In terms of the region of donations, overseas Chinese in Asia donated 32,414,565.61 yuan, overseas Chinese in the Americas donated 4,664,998.93 yuan, overseas Chinese in Europe donated 251,480.32 yuan, overseas Chinese in Oceania donated 1,050,696.90 yuan, and overseas Chinese in Africa donated 821.502.48 yuan. This movement of remittances and donations is still continuing. A large number of overseas Chinese laborers have voluntarily pre-ordered amounts and made long-term donations to contribute to the country. There are also a small number of capitalists who have returned to the country to invest and participate in the economic development of the southwest and other regions. These actions are of great help to achieving military victory in the long-term war of resistance. In the current Sixth Plenary Session, a special telegram of sympathy was issued to overseas Chinese. This is naturally an encouragement that should be given to patriotic overseas Chinese. At the same time, it also proves how important the economic donations of overseas Chinese are. Overseas Chinese have made such great contributions to the country in the past, and they will surely continue to respond to the domestic donation movement and strive to donate remittances back to the country. At the same time, the general public will certainly not lag behind and will be happy to dedicate their stored gold and silver ornaments, as well as securities and real estate, to the country. This will not only benefit the country, but also prove the country's hope for the future of the war of resistance: the advancement of national consciousness and national morality.

### League of Nations Accepts Finland's Application; Schedules Discussion of Dispute Between Soviet Union and Finland; Executive Yuan Meets on 9th, General Assembly on 11th; Rumors of Soviet Government Announcing Withdrawal from League of Nations Soon

Geneva: The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, recently issued a notice stating that the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations will meet on the 9th of this month, and the General Assembly of the League of Nations will meet on the 11th of this month to discuss the application submitted by Finland. The content of the application is roughly as follows: "The Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Tartu with our country in 1920. Since then, the two countries have maintained friendly relations and signed a non-aggression treaty in 1932, which is not due to expire until 1945. Our country has made every effort to maintain peace with this strong neighbor. Unexpectedly, that country, citing border disputes and falsely accusing our country of refusing to protect the safety of Leningrad, first declared the abolition of the non-aggression treaty and then refused our country's proposal and refused to submit the dispute to neutral countries for mediation. Finally, on November 30, it suddenly sent troops to invade our border and used aircraft to attack our country's undefended cities, causing ordinary people to be poisoned. For this reason, our country specially invokes Articles 11 and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant and requests your Secretary-General to immediately convene the Executive Yuan and the General Assembly of the League of Nations and ask them to take various measures to stop the aggression." (3rd Havas Dispatch)

Geneva: Finnish Minister to France, Holma, left Paris last night and will come here to attend the extraordinary meeting of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations with the country's representative to the League of Nations, Holsti. The meeting was requested by the Finnish government to resolve the Soviet-Finnish conflict. (4th Haitong Dispatch)

London: Regarding the holding of a meeting of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations to discuss Finland's application, the British government has received a notice from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, and is currently studying it. It will issue a declaration in a short period of time. As for who the Soviet government will send to attend, it has not yet been decided. Previously, when the Executive Yuan was scheduled to meet on this month (i.e., today), the Soviet government originally planned to appoint Ambassador to France Suritz as its representative, but the appointment was canceled due to the Executive Yuan's postponement of the meeting. This time, the Soviet government should change its appointment to Ambassador to the United Kingdom , who has been unwell for many days, is now recovered. (4th Havas Dispatch)

Stockholm: According to a reporter from the "Stockholm News" stationed in Moscow, the Soviet Union will announce its withdrawal from the League of Nations in Geneva. The date is expected to be the 11th of this month. (9th Haitong Dispatch)

Paris: Finland's complaint to the League of Nations has been commented on by diplomatic circles here, who generally say that since Soviet aggression has been evident in practice, it is doubtful whether Finland's appeal to the League of Nations will achieve anything. If the country had taken this action when the Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations with it, the Soviet Union's declaration of severance would have had no reason to say that peace was harmed, and the League of Nations could have dealt with it in time. However, the situation developed rapidly, and the Finnish government really had no time for this. By this time, the League of Nations may be powerless. Fortunately, Finnish troops are fighting heroically, which is also a major factor in Europe's emphasis on power. In the current environment, the country's submission of complaints to the League of Nations is noteworthy: this move is voluntary and is not encouraged by other countries. As for the reason why the League of Nations is unable to do anything about this kind of incident, it is due to the attitudes adopted by most neutral countries, especially the Scandinavian countries, over the years. The League of Nations' weapons against aggressor countries have always been opposed by these neutral countries. For example, the sanctions contained in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant were originally believed to be safe and reliable by these countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland subsequently joined), but they have all strongly advocated their abolition, which is clear proof. And how can it be known that the word "neutrality" is not enough to prevent intrusion, and there is evidence to prove it? In general, a major mistake has already been made, and the Finnish government itself should not have any illusions. Its real goal is nothing more than to awaken the world's consciousness to oppose aggression. On the other hand, Finland may also use the opportunity of the League of Nations Executive Yuan meeting to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union. It is also possible that the government has already conveyed this intention to the Soviet authorities through the Swedish Minister to the Soviet Union, Wensel, but it is feared that the Soviet authorities have little hope of agreeing.

### Major Cities in Finland Evacuate Population

Stockholm: According to Finnish news, the residents of the Finnish capital have been evacuated. Other major cities are also scheduled to be evacuated tonight. The evacuation work in the Finnish capital lacks organization. 100,000 residents do not have suitable housing in the countryside and have taken refuge in the forests, temporarily living in tents. Children are also often separated from their parents. The giant holes in the streets of the Finnish capital, bombed by Soviet aircraft, have not yet been filled. It is said that during the air raid on the 1st, many Finnish air defense were destroyed, and the roof of the Lutheran church was also destroyed. There are rumors that the Finnish government has moved out of the Finnish capital, but the latest news proves that the Finnish Inner still remains in the Finnish capital, but will move to an undisclosed location in the near future. Many reporters are also still here. (4th Haitong Dispatch)

The Red Army on the Murmansk front continued to mop up the defeated Finnish army, and the Soviet army on the Uht, Liepola, Porothanzhairo, and Petrozavodsk fronts has pushed 40 to 45 kilometers beyond the border. Because the roads in the area are poor, the Red Army is now building roads on the non-frozen swamps to facilitate marching. The Red Army in the Karelian Isthmus also advanced 30 to 35 kilometers from the border, successively occupied the Maustamaki station, and attacked the Inno station. The Soviet Baltic Fleet operated successfully and has occupied Sur Sari Island (i.e., Hogland Island), Seskari Island, and the two islands of Tetal Sari in the Gulf of Finland. The air force did not operate due to bad weather. (4th TASS Dispatch)

Helsinki – According to a communiqué issued here today, fighting has subsided on the eastern front, except north of Lake Ladoga, due to heavy snow.

### Squadron of British Bombers Attacks German Naval Base; German Destroyer Shot Down, and Submarine Destroyed

London – The Air Ministry has announced that a squadron of British bombers flew to the vicinity of the German naval base on Heligoland Island this afternoon and bombed the German fleet with large bombs, several of which hit their targets. Only one German destroyer took off to intercept them and was immediately shot down. Afterwards, all British aircraft safely returned to base. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

Berlin – The German side declared that when the British Air Force bombed Heligoland Island, the German forces fired intense anti-aircraft guns, so the British Air Force could only drop a few bombs, and the result was only sinking one fishing boat. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)

London – The Air Ministry announced last night that a British coastal reconnaissance aircraft destroyed a German submarine yesterday. The pilot flew about 150 miles offshore and saw a small object eight miles away. Upon inspection with binoculars, he determined it was a seagoing submarine. He then ascended into the clouds to avoid being seen by the enemy, and then swooped down on the target. By the time the German submarine personnel opened the aircraft ignition, it was too late to escape. The British aircraft dropped a bomb on the target, which hit the submarine near the conning tower and exploded before it could submerge. The British aircraft circled for about five minutes, searching for surviving sailors from the submarine, but saw no one. They then saw water splashing up in an oval shape where the submarine had sunk. The British aircraft then returned to its original defense and reported to the authorities by radio. When the Coastal Air Defense Command received this telegram, Minister of Heavy Industry Hall and Minister Without Portfolio Hankey were visiting the command. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

London – The Admiralty has just released a message stating that several officers and men of the German submarine recently captured have landed at a port in Scotland. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

### British Admiralty Announces Naval Warfare Results: German Ships Lost Three or Four

London – The Admiralty issued this morning the results of naval warfare over the past three months, stating that, as of now, we have captured 114 officers and men from German submarines and intercepted 32 German freighters, totaling 17,390 tons. A total of 410 British citizens have died due to enemy attacks on maritime transport. Only four Germans have died due to the activities of British warships. Also, from November 25 to December 2, we lost six ships, totaling 23,272 tons. The tonnage lost in November has decreased by two-thirds compared to September. Neutral countries lost six ships between November 25 and December 2, showing that the British Navy's mine-sweeping efforts have been very effective. The number of mines laid by the enemy is also not as high as during the outbreak of war. On the other hand, in the past three months, British freighters have transported 2,000,000 tons of goods under the protection of warships, of which the losses only account for four percent of the total. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Impact of the Blockade on Germany

(Paris Air Communication) French naval figures recently stated that most of the various essential goods vital to Germany's survival must be obtained from foreign markets. Since the implementation of the blockade policy by the Allied countries of England and France, the country has suffered severe blows in terms of material supply. At this time, the Allied forces of England and France have repeatedly strengthened their inspection methods, and Germany's situation has become increasingly worse. The country's need for grains, meat, fats, ore, textiles, and cotton, which are indispensable for the armaments industry, has always relied on imports. The country has accumulated these types of goods for war preparations for more than a year, which is well known, but relying solely on stockpiles cannot last long, which is the reality. Some say that since Germany has occupied Poland and is cooperating economically with the Soviet Union, its shortages of grain and kerosene are no longer a concern. In fact, this observation is not very well-founded. As of now, it is difficult to estimate to what extent Polish products can help Germany. At the same time, there is little evidence to prove that the Soviet Union is willing to supply Germany. As for the grains produced by Germany each year, it is only enough to supply a small part of its own consumption. Therefore, it needs to import grains every year, especially wheat and rye, about 890 million tons. The domestic output of other items such as meat, fats, and fruits is also very limited. Taking only meat and livestock as an example, experts estimate that the total number of imports each year is worth £11 million. The country has actively promoted animal husbandry to save and remedy this, as a fundamental plan for increasing income. Although meat imports can be reduced as a result, the quantity of imported fodder, bean cakes, and oats has increased accordingly, reaching about 2.5 million tons per year. In addition, the country imported about 150 million marks worth of butter and cheese and about 218 million marks worth of wheat, fruits, and various vegetable oils last year. All these items were transported to Germany by sea. Since the implementation of the blockade by England and France, their sources have been almost entirely cut off. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, the country has stepped up its search for substitutes for various foods and other raw materials. For example, the country used fresh fish to replace meat in the early stages of the war, but since the English and French fleets swept away Germany's fishing industry in the North Sea, the source of fish has also become a problem. In addition, the country needs about 22 million tons of ore annually in addition to what it produces domestically. Since the main source of this ore has been almost completely cut off, it now relies solely on the Scandinavian countries as its source. Moreover, as the harsh winter approaches, navigation is becoming increasingly difficult, and even this small amount of trade is difficult to maintain. As for kerosene, Germany has now implemented various restrictions on consumption in order to match supply and demand. In fact, of the countries that imported kerosene into Germany before the war, eight out of ten have cut off traffic with Germany due to the blockade policies of England and France. (Havas)

### Hungarian Bank President to Visit London

London – The Daily Telegraph recently carried a dispatch from its correspondent in the Hungarian capital stating that the President of the National Bank of Hungary, Konder, will visit London in a few days. This move is very important at a time when a German economic delegation is negotiating with the Hungarian government and the heads of the National Bank. As for the German-Hungarian economic negotiations, the German chief representative, Clodius, has put forward several plans, one of which proposes that Germany control Hungary's foreign trade. Germany will designate the quantity of goods needed by the country and the proportion of goods exported to Germany and other countries. Germany and Hungary should also implement offset measures, so that Germany's trade surplus with Hungary can reach £35 million. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Secret Tunnel on the Belgian-Dutch Border

Brussels – A tunnel was discovered near Turnhout on the Belgian-Dutch border yesterday that could be used to travel between Belgium and the Netherlands.

Washington – After President Roosevelt telegraphed the heads of state of Finland and the Soviet Union, asking them not to bomb ordinary people and unfortified cities, Finland has already submitted a reply, stating, "The principles of international law suggested by your great President are endorsed by our government. We hereby declare that our troops will never bomb ordinary people and unfortified cities under any circumstances, but only on the condition that the enemy strictly adopts the same methods." According to the State Department, the Soviet reply has not yet been received. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Anti-Soviet Demonstration Held in Rome

Rome – Today, there was another demonstration here in sympathy with Finland and against the Soviet Union. Groups of students gathered outside the Finnish Embassy, shouting anti-Soviet slogans. The Finnish ambassador appeared on the balcony of the embassy to greet the demonstrators. The demonstrators then continued forward, shouting "Long live Finland" and "Down with the Soviet Union" along the way. The Soviet Embassy is now heavily guarded, with troops stationed nearby, on alert, resulting in the area being virtually isolated from the outside world. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Meets with US Ambassador; Both Sides Do Not Disclose the Content of the Talks; Nomura Also Meets with British Ambassador Craigie

Tokyo – US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Foreign Minister Nomura had a 45-minute talk at the Foreign Minister's official residence today, discussing the problems between the US and Japan. However, neither side was willing to express their opinions on the results of the meeting afterwards. According to Japanese sources, the two sides discussed the situation after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. Japanese newspapers believe that Nomura must have also discussed Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union with the US side, especially Japan's willingness to improve general relations with the Soviet Union, but is unwilling to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. At the same time, it is said that Grew presented Nomura with various memoranda. It is heard that Nomura and Grew discussed various outstanding issues during the meeting. Nomura and Grew will meet again, but the date has not been set. In addition, the Japanese side still has some issues related to China that it intends to discuss with the United States. If there are results at that time, a statement will be issued simultaneously in Washington and Tokyo. (United Press dispatch, 4th)

Tokyo – The Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the following message regarding the meeting between Foreign Minister Nomura and Ambassador Craigie on the afternoon of the 4th: 1. Foreign Minister Nomura received Ambassador Craigie, who came to visit, at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, and discussed various aspects of Japan-US relations in a constructive spirit, and shook hands at 4:15 PM. (Dōmei dispatch, 4th)

Tokyo – Foreign Minister Nomura met with US Ambassador to Japan Grew on November 4 to seek opinions on adjusting Japan-US relations. As a result of careful study by Foreign Minister Nomura, it was concluded that adjustments to Japan-US relations cannot be expected unless there is concrete progress in Japan's handling of the China Incident and a complete understanding is established between Japan and the United States. However, before that time, Japan should seek concrete solutions to the losses suffered by the United States in the incident to avoid unnecessary friction. Therefore, this afternoon at 2:00 PM, he invited the US ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain the above views and exchange various opinions. (Dōmei dispatch, 4th)

Tokyo – The meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and US Ambassador to Japan Grew at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon is highly valued by all parties here. Grew visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the invitation of Nomura at 2:30 PM this afternoon, and then had a closed-door meeting with Nomura for more than an hour and a half. Grew left at 4:15 PM. It is said that the two sides discussed various points of Japan-US relations in a constructive manner. Japanese newspapers are competing to report on this matter and speculate wildly. The Nichinichi Shimbun claims that Grew and Nomura discussed the possibility of Japan enjoying most-favored-nation treatment after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty on January 26. However, reliable sources do not believe that the discussion has reached this stage, but they feel that it is noteworthy that Japan is first contacting the US. This is because Japan now feels that the situation arising from the abolition of the US-Japan treaty is serious. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

### Pacific Relations Conference Discusses Far East Issues

Virginia Beach – The Pacific Relations Conference, which opened here on Saturday, discussed Far East issues yesterday. International law expert Dr. Jessup announced today that the conference's research results believe that the positions of England and France in the Far East have been greatly weakened after the outbreak of the European War. At the same time, due to the diplomatic position of the Soviet Union, the Sino-Japanese War has fallen into a stalemate. He also said that the current Soviet Union and the United States are in the most favorable positions to interfere in the Sino-Japanese war. (United Press dispatch, 4th)

### Shaw on the Current Situation in Finland

Amsterdam – The London "Daily Mail" published yesterday an interview with the great British writer George Bernard Shaw by a reporter from the newspaper. Shaw commented on the Finnish issue, saying that Finland's current misfortune is indirectly responsible for the United States and Western democratic countries, because the Finnish government pursued a shortsighted policy, believing that the United States and England and France would come out to help. Shaw continued that the situation on the Russian-Finnish border and the position of the important town of Leningrad could not be tolerated by any great power, especially Finland's reliance on other powers, threatening the security of its neighbors.

Tokyo – A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters today that Japan's policy towards the Soviet Union is currently focused on resolving outstanding issues, such as Japanese fishing rights in Kamchatka and Japanese rights in northern Sakhalin. Japan's problems do not include a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty. The spokesman did not comment on the Soviet invasion of Finland, only saying that the Japanese government is now paying close attention to the progress of this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

Tokyo – The Miyako Shimbun commented today on the progress of Japanese-Soviet negotiations, saying that the Soviet Union wants to first negotiate a type of understanding on the basic principles of the agreement and then solve the specific problems, but Japan wants to solve the specific problems first. It is known that the determination of the Manchurian border, the Japanese fishing treaty, and the regulations on Japanese rights in northern Sakhalin will be solved before a fundamental solution to Japanese-Soviet relations can be made. The Japanese government is unwilling to hastily establish a fundamental Japanese-Soviet understanding, because it can seriously damage the authority of the Japanese government's anti-communist policy and cause ideological turmoil in the country. Some Japanese public opinion believe that the long-pending issue of Japanese-Soviet relations should be adjusted as soon as possible to cope with the recent developments in Japanese-US relations and facilitate the handling of the China Incident. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

Tokyo – A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today regarding the Japanese-Soviet negotiations that Japan currently does not intend to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia. At the same time, it is believed that the Soviet Union also has no intention of concluding this treaty for the time being, so the scope and results of the Japanese-Soviet negotiations are still difficult to predict at this time.

### Soviets and Romanians Agree on Traffic Arrangements

Cernăuți, Romania – Since the Soviet army invaded Poland in mid-September of this year, railway traffic between Cernăuți, Romania and Lviv, Poland has been interrupted. Representatives of Romania and the Soviet Union have been negotiating for a long time to restore traffic. On the 1st of this month, minutes were signed deciding on temporary traffic arrangements, allowing five freight trains to run each day, but they must run at night. It is heard that if Germany wants to transport goods via the northern route (i.e., transporting goods from Romania to Germany via this route), it must pay a huge transit tax to the Soviet Union and must pay in cash or foreign currency. In addition, all 2,800 of Romania's freight cars have been sent to Germany for a long time and have not been released by that country. The Romanian side is very anxious. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

Luoyang: The Chinese Air Force, under the bright moonlight on the evening of the 27th, took off from an undisclosed location to bomb Yuncheng. Upon arriving over Yuncheng, the Japanese began to detect them, panicked, and hastily fired artillery. The Chinese planes circled for several weeks, accurately targeting the Japanese military stronghold and dropping dozens of bombs, all of which hit the target. For a time, the fire illuminated the sky, and the sound reverberated through the clouds. Even dozens of miles away, the sound was clearly audible. The Chinese planes returned safely after completing their mission. (4th dispatch)

As of the 2nd, the Chinese army was still surrounding them. (4th dispatch)

### Wu Peifu Passes Away in Beiping, Death Caused by Septicemia Resulting from Dental Disease, Doctor's Surgery Proves Ineffective

Beiping: Wu Peifu, whose condition rapidly worsened due to a dental disease four or five days ago, was in critical condition by the afternoon of the 4th. Despite the best efforts of his attending physician, surgery proved ineffective, and he finally passed away at 7 PM, at the age of sixty-eight. (4th Domei News Agency dispatch)

Beiping: Wu Peifu suffered from toothache four or five days ago. He sought treatment from Chinese and Japanese doctors at his residence in Shijin Garden. However, his condition deteriorated, leading to septicemia. Therefore, a final treatment measure was adopted on the afternoon of the 4th, with surgery performed on his [unclear] area. However, it was ineffective, and he was in critical condition by 5:30 PM. (4th Domei News Agency dispatch)

Hong Kong: News from Beiping states that Wu Peifu is currently in critical condition. Some days ago, Wu only mentioned suffering from a slight toothache, but it later developed into blood poisoning. Although doctors from China, Germany, and Japan performed surgery on the afternoon [unclear], removing the diseased tooth, it was still ineffective, and his condition has become dangerous. (4th dispatch)

Beiping: General Wu Peifu, a Northern warlord who repeatedly declined invitations from the Japanese to head a "New Central Government," passed away today after having a tooth extracted. The time was 7 PM, and he was sixty-seven years old. According to the Japanese, Wu's death was caused by a progressive cavity, which led to blood poisoning. In addition to Japanese doctors, German doctors were also involved in performing the tooth extraction surgery, but to no avail. According to Japanese reports, Wu Peifu retreated to Sichuan after being defeated by the revolutionary army in the Wuchang area in 1927. He later settled in Beiping. Recently, he suffered from toothache and was examined by Japanese and Chinese doctors. As of today, his condition worsened, and it was decided to perform tooth extraction surgery. Unexpectedly, his blood poisoning was too severe, and it was already ineffective. Wu Peifu was a native of Penglai County, Shandong, born in 1872. In 1890, he graduated from the Beiyang Military Academy and successively served as the commander of the 6th Association of the 3rd Army Division. After the founding of the Republic of China, he served as the brigade commander of the 6th Brigade of the 3rd Division. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor and Yunnan rose up in rebellion, Wu led troops to suppress the uprising. After Cao Kun was appointed as the Governor of Zhili, Wu succeeded him as the acting division commander of the 3rd Division. After suppressing Zhang Xun's restoration movement, Wu was formally appointed as the division commander of the 3rd Division. Later, the Beiyang government ordered him to attack the Southwestern government, but Wu stopped his troops in Hengyang and issued a peace telegram, which led to the North-South peace conference. The following year, he was appointed as the Deputy Inspector of the Three Provinces of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan. In 1921, he was promoted to Inspector of the Two Lakes. In 1922, he was appointed as the Minister of the Army, but Wu refused to accept the position. In 1923, he was awarded the title of General Fuyou. The following year, Cao Kun became president, and Wu was appointed as the Inspector of the Three Provinces of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan. In 1924, the Zhili-Fengtian War broke out, and Wu was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Zhili army. He was later defeated due to Feng Yuxiang's betrayal. However, Wu later allied with Zhang Zuolin, allowing him to maintain some power. In 1926, he was ordered to be the commander-in-chief of the anti-communist army, but was defeated by the revolutionary army in 1927. He then went into seclusion. Recently, the Japanese repeatedly sought his leadership, but he consistently refused, preserving his integrity in his later years and proving himself to be a model Chinese soldier.

### Wartime Europe March: Special London Correspondence, France's All-Out Effort

— Shu Di

France's resolute entry onto the battlefield this time is imbued with a profound sense of solemnity and considerable melancholy. With a population of forty-five million, France has mobilized every corner of the nation, every person and object directly or indirectly related to wartime affairs, upon its decision to embark on this war. Not only have all able-bodied men enlisted, but even the elderly and infirm, not typically considered "able-bodied," have been exhaustively recruited. Even veterans who were wounded in the previous European war and would normally be exempt from service have been recalled to take up arms for the country again, an unprecedented move. Everyone returning to London from France these days is unanimously reporting a particularly striking phenomenon:

Everywhere, it seems that men have disappeared altogether.

What insights and resolutions has France embraced to steadfastly enter the battlefield in this way?

Tracing the question back a little, we arrive again at the Munich Conference last year. It may sound unbelievable, but the reality is that France's primary goal in entering the battlefield today is to restore the independence of Czechoslovakia! Last September, Daladier followed Chamberlain, sacrificing Czechoslovakia in a confused and misguided manner. At the time, discerning individuals recognized that France was dismantling its own defenses, and the inevitable consequence would be France itself falling into danger. This recognition has been vividly felt by France in the evolution of the European situation in recent months. Therefore, during the days when the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations were underway, Chamberlain and his ilk were again planning to seize the opportunity to settle all mutual contradictions with Germany. France's prerequisite was also the restoration of Czechoslovakia's independence. Subsequently, the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact" was suddenly announced, abruptly pushing Europe to the brink of war. And one of France's war slogans at this time is also "Restore the independence of Czechoslovakia!"

If we pay close attention to the declarations of the war intentions of Britain and France in recent days, we can immediately discern a subtle but very clear difference: Britain prioritizes Poland, which is currently under German aggression, but France places its emphasis on Czechoslovakia, which has already been annexed.

Without an independent Czechoslovakia, France's security is absolutely unguaranteed. To ensure the safety of the French Empire, rather than waiting for the knife of German-Italian aggression to turn towards itself before resisting, it is better to step onto the battlefield early and make restoring Czechoslovakia's independence one of the war slogans.

There is also a worrisome matter, namely, the hostile existence of Spain under Franco's rule. Since the appointment of General Pétain, the French ambassador to Spain, this spring, an extremely fierce diplomatic battle has unfolded in Spain between Britain and France and Germany and Italy. Ambassador Pétain, at the advanced age of over eighty, also has a teacher-student relationship with Franco. His sole mission is to execute Chamberlain and Daladier's ingenious plan to bring Franco into the embrace of Britain and France. However, under the intense pressure and encirclement of Germany and Italy, Spain's path toward Germany and Italy has been advancing day by day. While everyone's attention has been focused on certain events in Central and Eastern Europe, French authorities have been deeply concerned about the military preparations being carried out by Germany and Italy in Spain. Everyone knows that if Spain were to join the war, France would be facing enemies on three sides. The most dangerous time for this "three-sided threat" to materialize would be the day when Spain completes its military installations in the Pyrenees region. Therefore, in June and July, Ambassador Pétain returned to Paris and delivered the most urgent warning to the French authorities.

Among the many significant reasons why Germany and Italy are not prepared to provoke a major war with Britain and France at this time, the fact that Spain's military preparations have yet to be completed should also be listed as an important factor. Therefore, from France's perspective, the implication is: If war breaks out with Germany at this time, Spain will not join the war, at least in the short term; that is one point. As the war progresses, France can take advantage of its geographical advantages to compete with Germany for Spain's friendship; that is the second point. If Britain and France are likely to defeat Germany in the shortest period, or at least weaken Germany's strength, then Spain's eventual separation from Germany and Italy is also possible; that is the third point. This is France's current thinking.

What France finds most difficult to handle is still the existence of Italy's intention to aggress against France. It has long been clamored: "Gibraltar! Tunisia! Corsica!" This has only been temporarily shelved due to Germany's continuous instigation of disputes. Once the German issue with Poland is resolved, then the expected thing will definitely be:

"Gibraltar! Tunisia! Corsica!" The Italian slogan of aggression will be raised against France again.

Daladier once declared: "France would rather fight than give up an inch of territory!" Then, at that time, will it be war or submission? It is obviously a difficult situation to handle. Of course, the development of the situation is very clear: If Britain and France were to retreat again in the Polish issue, then, emboldened by successive victories, Hitler would fully support Mussolini's territorial demands on France, and at that time, France would be in an impossible state to resist.

Poland is fighting this time for itself, and also for Britain and France. The beginnings of the resolution of future Franco-Italian disputes largely depend on France's attitude in the current Polish war.

Therefore, France decided to declare war on Germany alongside Britain due to Germany's invasion of Poland.

Here, it is worth pointing out that France's participation in this war is completely different from the enthusiastic mood of the last European war. To put it more clearly, it can be said that a spirit of generous sacrifice exceeds the mood of great ambition. Beneath all this, a certain sense of defeatism is more or less lurking. So, why?

There are two things we must remember when understanding France's mood in joining this war: First, since the past six months, France's repeated attempts to urge Britain to form an alliance with the Soviet Union have repeatedly failed. Second, the plan for large-scale British expeditionary training, repeatedly requested by the French General Staff, has not been smoothly adopted by Britain.

In order to prevent Germany's resurgence, France had successively concluded mutual assistance pacts with Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, and other countries. However, all these mutual assistance agreements were successively dissolved after the Munich Conference and the Franco-German non-aggression declaration. France had only one goal in mind while doing all this: to maintain friendship with Britain and France at all costs. But the French authorities, following Chamberlain in this way, had been suffering internally. Therefore, as soon as the British authorities suddenly turned to guaranteeing Poland, and simultaneously began cooperation talks with the Soviet Union, the French side immediately became very excited as if they had discovered a ray of light. Until the eve of the announcement of the Soviet-German agreement, France still held great hope for the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet-French alliance. But suddenly, the Soviet-German agreement was announced. France's performance at this time was probably: Judging from everything expressed by the public, the Soviet Union became the target of blame and resentment; and inwardly, everyone understood very well that the root cause of the British cabinet's policy of playing both sides was that it had bungled things.

Amid this atmosphere of great disappointment and dissatisfaction with Britain, Britain and France decided to declare war on Germany over the German-Polish war. We must know that at the moment of declaring war, France's attitude was indeed very dejected. This should be considered the lingering aftermath of the failure of Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations.

The issue of dispatching expeditionary forces has been a topic of constant negotiation between British and French authorities for the past year. It was not until this summer, when Britain announced the implementation of a partial conscription system, that it finally achieved some effect. But it was still far from the French side's hopes. The detailed situation is beyond the scope of this article, so it will not be discussed here. But what needs to be pointed out is the considerable estrangement between Britain and France caused by this issue. We only need to look at how often people like the British Eden have repeatedly issued warnings to the British authorities on this matter, and the constant complaints from the French side, then the seriousness of the situation is not difficult to imagine. But at this time, Britain and France jointly declared war on Germany. Under such circumstances, the French military authorities' considerable disappointment with Britain is naturally unavoidable.

In conclusion, although there have been some estrangement and even disappointment, in general, France's attitude during this war, or even the attitude it will take after participating in the war in the future, will still be the same as before, following Britain. In a broader perspective, France will spare no effort to achieve consistency with Britain. I think this can be asserted even now. (September 8)

### False Police Assault and Insult American Resident, U.S. Consulate Lodges Protest, Retired U.S. Military Officer and His Japanese Wife Assaulted Without Reason on Way to Park, Japanese Wife Not U.S. Citizen, Protest Note Does Not Mention Her

The Japanese diplomatic community is currently planning to improve the relationship between China and Japan in Shanghai and Tokyo. However, the six hundred protests that the United States has lodged with Japan over the past two years have not been resolved. Yesterday morning, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai lodged another protest with the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai regarding the assault and insult of American resident Mr. Pannisden by false police the day before. The detailed circumstances of the incident are as follows:

False Police Assault and Insult Mr. and Mrs. Pannisden

According to the Continental Daily News, Mr. Pannisden, who served as a major in the U.S. Army during World War I, and his Japanese wife were taking their baby to Zhaofeng Park at approximately two thirty in the afternoon of yesterday [the 3rd]. While walking on Moxian Road near Brenan Road, they were severely mistreated by six "Da Dao" police officers. Both Mr. and Mrs. Pannisden were assaulted and insulted by the false police. Mr. Pannisden suffered a minor arm injury, and his wife injured her shoulder. In addition, her leather coat was punctured by the police officers' bayonet. When this reporter interviewed Mr. Pannisden last night, he described the barbaric attitude and events of the police officers as follows:

Walking to the Park with a Baby Carriage

At approximately 2:30 PM yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Pannisden were on their way to Zhaofeng Park. Their baby was in a carriage cared for by a Chinese maid. When they reached the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Brenan Road, they saw false police officers standing on the sidewalk near the park. Mr. Pannisden asked the false police to make way. One of the false police officers, standing in the center of the sidewalk, only slightly moved to the side facing north.

False Police Obstruct and Intimidate with Guns

When Mrs. Pannisden and the baby were following behind Mr. Pannisden, one of the false policemen extended his left foot in front of the carriage wheels, obstructing their progress. Mr. Pannisden questioned the "Da Dao" police. Unexpectedly, the two police officers threatened them with the rifles they were carrying. At the same time, Mrs. Pannisden was blocked by another false policeman and, speaking in Chinese, also questioned them. Mr. Pannisden does not understand Chinese, so he did not understand what his wife was saying.

Japanese Wife Slapped

One of the false police officers asked Mrs. Pannisden about her nationality and said, "If you are Japanese, you can pass." Mrs. Pannisden did not answer. The false police officer, not knowing that Mrs. Pannisden was Japanese, slapped her face. In order to protect his wife from further abuse, Mr. Pannisden stepped forward and questioned the false police officers harshly.

Mr. Pannisden Himself Injured in the Left Arm

However, the false police officers, without asking for an explanation, directly struck Mr. Pannisden's left kidney with their rifle butts. At the same time, other false police officers stepped forward and violently struck Mrs. Pannisden's shoulder and punctured her leather coat. At that time, one of the "Da Dao" police officers stepped forward to mediate and helped Mrs. Pannisden, her baby, and the maid to proceed towards the park.

Visible Scars on Both

Mrs. Pannisden continued to scold in Chinese. The two police officers who had slapped Mrs. Pannisden, upon hearing this, became enraged and wanted to beat Mrs. Pannisden again. Fortunately, a Chinese man in plain clothes dissuaded them. Afterwards, Mr. Pannisden reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and will report to the U.S. Consulate today [the 4th]. Although Mr. and Mrs. Pannisden did not need to be hospitalized, their injuries were still clearly visible last night, and the pain had not subsided.

U.S. Consulate Protest Did Not Mention Mrs. Pannisden

According to Dazhong News Agency, Mr. Pannisden reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and the U.S. Consulate General. The U.S. Consul General lodged a protest with the Japanese side yesterday. The note submitted by the U.S. Consulate only protested the violation against Major Pannisden and did not mention Mrs. Pannisden because she is not a U.S. citizen.

### Chinese Troops Attack Zha Pu in Three Routes

A visitor from Zha Pu said that since January of this year, the Seashore Club outside the South Gate of Zha Pu has been guarded by Japanese troops. Defensive fortifications have been built around it, and there are seventy to eighty Japanese soldiers stationed there, who dare not take a step beyond the perimeter. On the 1st of this month, a mobile unit of guerrillas launched an attack on the Seashore Club in three routes, and fierce battles broke out. From morning to 4 PM, the Seashore Club was surrounded on all sides. A portion of the Chinese troops scaled the city walls and fired from a high position, killing more than twenty Japanese soldiers. Another unit of Chinese troops advanced eastward along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. The machine gun team on the city walls provided cover for the advancing troops, who charged bravely and captured a small Japanese cannon, seven rifles, and two light machine guns. The Chinese side also sacrificed three men. Later, the Japanese side sent reinforcements from warships to land, and the Chinese troops, having achieved their goal of depleting the Japanese troops, withdrew and returned to their original defensive positions.

### A Fake Policeman Shoots a British Soldier: British Military Conducts Thorough Investigation. Two Arrested British Men Released Yesterday Morning. Young Woman Dies from Serious Gunshot Wound.

Last night, a squad of fake police officers shot ten rounds at British soldiers outside the Danish-owned “wine bar” at 48 Great Western Road (Jing'an Temple Road intersection). The British military authorities are continuing their investigation. The incident occurred when a squad of fake police officers arrested one soldier from the British East Surrey Regiment and a British national in front of the wine bar. Other British soldiers dining inside the wine bar rushed out upon hearing the commotion to rescue their comrade and compatriot. The fake police officers opened fire on them. The British soldiers retreated into the wine bar. The fake police officers then escorted the British soldier and the British national to the Shanghai West Branch of the fake police station at 13 Jessfield Road. After negotiations by the British military authorities, they were released at 1:00 AM yesterday. During the shooting by the fake police, the only person hit was a young woman from Danyang, Zhang Fengdi, who was struck in the lower abdomen by a stray bullet. She collapsed on the road and was taken to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but she died at 11:55 PM the night before.

Western Newspapers Report on the Incident

The North-China Daily News stated that plainclothes "city" police fired shots at several unarmed British soldiers on Great Western Road last night (the 3rd), severely wounding a passing Chinese woman and "arresting" a British soldier and a civilian, believed to be British. The "city" police fired about ten shots with pistols and rifles. The British soldiers and police from the Public Concession did not return fire. The incident occurred in front of the "Busy Bee" Café at 48 Great Western Road around 10:00 PM. The British soldier and civilian were taken to 13 Jessfield Road, a house occupied by a Japanese "advisor" to the "city" police, Mr. Ruzhi. It is reported that the two were released at 1:00 AM this morning (the 4th). The soldier's name is Peel, from the East Surrey Regiment, who recently arrived in Shanghai from England. The name of the civilian is not yet confirmed. The injured Chinese woman was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. After emergency surgery, she remained unconscious as of 1:30 AM this morning, but it is hoped that her life can be saved. The woman was shot in the abdomen by the "city" police, with the bullet piercing her intestines and a kidney.

Fake Police Search Unarmed British Soldiers

It is reported that the incident began when off-duty, unarmed British soldiers had an altercation with armed "city" police, leading the "city" police to rush into Jack's Restaurant at 427 Great Western Road to search for a certain British soldier. The restaurant, located a short distance west of the "Busy Bee" Café, is owned by a Danish man named Schultz, whose family lives on the upper floor of the restaurant. At 10:10 PM last night, after the altercation between the British soldiers and the "city" police, a squad of "city police," numbering fifteen, each armed with rifles and pistols, broke down the front door of the restaurant and searched the premises from top to bottom.

A Shooting During Which a Chinese Woman Is Wounded

British soldier Peel and a civilian were found at the rear of the lower floor and arrested. While escorting them along Great Western Road, the "city" police saw a small group of unarmed British soldiers emerging from the "Busy Bee" Café and opened fire on them, firing at least fifteen shots, wounding one Chinese woman. None of the British soldiers were injured, and they scattered to find safety.

East Surrey Regiment Responds to the News

The gunfire was extremely loud and was heard by a mechanized patrol of the British East Surrey Regiment half a mile away. The patrol, along with another truck filled with fully armed British soldiers, rushed to the scene and formed a defensive line across the street from the shooting location. At the same time, other "city" police emerged from an alley and gathered at the sniping location. The wounded Chinese woman lay in a pool of blood.

Serious Standoff Ensues

A large squad of police officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, equipped with Thompson submachine guns, arrived

The Arrested British Nationals Are Released Through Negotiations

By 11:00 PM, the "city" police had departed by truck or on foot, leaving the British soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment and the police officers at the scene. The arrested British soldier and civilian had been taken to 13 Jessfield Road. British military liaison officer Major Ashmore, Assistant Chief Constable of the Police Department Major Hunter York,

and other officials went to negotiate the release of the British soldier and civilian.

Japanese Spokesperson Shifts Blame

Regarding the conflict between the fake police and British soldiers on Sunday night, a spokesperson for the Japanese Army expressed the Japanese perspective at a press conference last night, stating, "At 9:30 PM that evening, four British individuals, three of whom were soldiers, were drunk. One British soldier approached a 'police' post and demanded that the 'police' hand over their rifle. The 'police' refused, and the British soldier attempted to seize it, resulting in a scuffle. The rifle fell to the ground and made an explosive sound. As the British individuals retreated into a wine bar by the roadside, two other 'police' officers fired six shots into the air. A large group of 'police' then arrived, surrounded the wine bar, and searched the premises. However, the 'perpetrators' could not be found. The detained British soldier has already been released by the following morning." When foreign reporters pointed out that the fake police's indiscriminate shooting had fatally wounded a passing Chinese girl, and that the Japanese spokesperson had stated that the fake police only fired into the air, they asked how the passerby was injured. The Japanese spokesperson did not know the reason and replied, "The investigation is still ongoing."

### Japanese Military's "Iron Fist" Policy: Massacre of Innocent Civilians. Destruction of Beijing-Shanghai Train Confirmed. Civilians Along the Line are Tragically Massacred.

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, Chinese sources reported today (the 4th) that a train of Japanese military vehicles exploded on the morning of the 2nd near Zhenjiang on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway after hitting a landmine in the Gaogui area. Eight freight cars were destroyed and over 40 Japanese soldiers were killed. This news has been confirmed by guests from Nanjing who arrived in Shanghai last night (the 3rd). Furthermore, according to reports from Japanese-occupied areas in the interior, the Japanese military authorities are using an "iron fist" to "rule" the Chinese people. The Japanese military continues to bomb villages in the occupied areas suspected of having guerrilla activity. Dozens of civilians along the railway are being massacred every day in order to intimidate farmers into protecting the railway for the Japanese.

The Train Bombing at Linping Tragically Kills Innocents

Reports from Hangzhou today state that after a train was destroyed near Linping on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway on November 25th, thirty farmers, including women and children, were executed by the Japanese military the next day. The Japanese military accused them of failing to report the laying of landmines on the railway to the Japanese authorities and of assisting the guerrillas. In that train bombing, 37 people were killed or injured, and traffic was disrupted for three days. The Japanese side claimed that only ten people were killed or injured.

Thirty Feet of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Railway Track Destroyed

Two months later, guerrillas planted landmines at Pingwang on the Shanghai-Jiaxing Railway. The farmers of Pingwang, having heard of the Linping massacre, shouted loudly to stop the train as it approached the mine-laying site. The driver stopped the train, only meters from the buried landmine. The explosion was triggered by the vibrations, destroying the track

Group Massacres Across Northern China

According to news from North China, the Japanese authorities in the area are also attempting to subdue the Chinese people with an iron fist. In the villages and markets of Anguo, Boye, and other counties in Hebei province, organized group massacres occur almost daily. The Japanese military accuses those killed of assisting the Eighth Route Army or "refusing to use the Joint Reserve Bank notes." Even small farmers who are slightly better off are shot or beheaded. Many teachers and students aged fourteen to twenty are also not spared.

Most of the victims are first taken away. If they do not immediately pay a ransom, they are falsely accused of "crimes" and slaughtered. There are also frequent reports of Japanese soldiers raping women.

Anti-British and Anti-American Sentiment Intensifies

The Japanese are continuing anti-white propaganda in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces in the interior, vehemently attacking British and American nationals. Posters are plastered on walls everywhere, calling non-Japanese foreigners thieves, swindlers, and murderers. On a wall two miles from Dingzhou, slogans are painted in large red and white characters, each character two or three feet in size. The slogans are as follows: (1) White people are thieves and swindlers; (2) Down with England; (3) America (Red-Headed Devils) is England's lackey; (4) The Soviet Union is our second enemy; (5) Boycott British goods and sever ties with British nationals; (6) Beware of America.

Heavy Casualties in "Mopping-Up" Operations

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury's correspondent in North China, the Japanese military's "mopping-up" operations in North China are nothing but a farce. The Japanese military suffers heavy casualties in these operations. After dusk, the Japanese garrison does not dare to venture a step beyond their fortress. They only attack villages during the day, extorting eggs, chickens, and slaughtered animals, and even sexually assaulting women. The guerrillas "work" at night, punishing Japanese soldiers or villagers who assist them.

### Restrictions Imposed on Overseas Chinese Laborers Leaving Their Jobs; Wartime Exchange Difficulties; British Students Forced to Drop Out of School

Due to the impact of the European War, many overseas Chinese laborers are being forced out of their jobs and returning to China. Approximately 300 people from France, Italy, the Netherlands, and other countries have arrived in Shanghai. At noon yesterday, the French postal liner President Doumergues arrived in Shanghai from Europe, carrying 72 overseas Chinese from Zhejiang Province who had been living in France. Those who had previously returned from France went to the dock to greet them and take them to lodgings. They all plan to stay in Shanghai for a short time before returning to their hometowns.

Overseas Chinese Businesses Close

According to Mr. Wu Tingye, an overseas Chinese businessman, since the outbreak of the European War, France has implemented wartime measures, and the situation in various industries is very different from the past. Overseas Chinese businesses, due to their limited capital, are easily affected by setbacks. After the outbreak of the European War, overseas Chinese shops were the first to be affected. Currently, in Paris, only a few overseas Chinese shops that run restaurants are still operating; the rest have closed one after another. These overseas Chinese businessmen who have closed their businesses have nothing to do and are preparing to return home.

Students Forced to Drop Out of School

Currently, overseas Chinese living in France are not the only ones suffering from unemployment; many students are also being forced to drop out of school. Due to wartime exchange difficulties, it is difficult for students studying in France at their own expense to remit tuition fees. Those who have no choice but to drop out of school and return home are not uncommon. Seven students who departed from Marseille on the same ship also came to China. They all landed in Annam and are preparing to go to work in the southwest.

Restrictions on Leaving Jobs

Recently, the French government, in order to meet wartime needs, has restricted foreign nationals working in French factories from leaving their jobs. This is because the number of French workers in various factories has sharply decreased since they were conscripted into military service. Foreign workers who are nationals of countries that have friendly relations with France are expected to share the burden and help each other in the national interest and cannot ignore the affairs of their host country. Therefore, Chinese workers are also included in the list of those restricted from resigning. However, the French government will not forcibly detain foreign workers who must return to their home countries, but they must obtain permission from the military authorities and be issued a permit before they can leave their jobs and return home.

### Three Steamships Arrive in Shanghai

The American President Lines' President Coolidge has changed its itinerary and departed from Los Angeles. After stopping in Japan, it will sail directly to Hong Kong and Manila. On its return trip from Manila, it will pass through Hong Kong and Shanghai before returning to Japan and Los Angeles. The above information has been reported in previous newspapers. Now, the ship has passed through Hong Kong on its return trip from Manila and is scheduled to enter the port at 8:00 PM tonight. The ship is scheduled to depart at 4:00 PM tomorrow (the 6th) to return to Japan and the United States. The Changxing Company's Russian Empress, sailing from Vancouver via Japan to Shanghai, is scheduled to enter the port at 8:30 AM this morning. It is scheduled to dock at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. The ship is scheduled to depart at 4:00 PM tomorrow (the 6th) to go to Hong Kong and Manila. The Java Mail Line's Tjinegara, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday (the 4th), has been delayed by two days due to delays along the way, according to the company. It is now expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 6th). The exact time of entry will be known after the ship sends a telegram today. The ship was originally scheduled to depart on the 7th to return to Surabaya, but this has also been delayed by one day. It will depart on the 8th, first to Xiamen and then to Hong Kong, before returning to Surabaya via various places in Southeast Asia.

### Fake Police Intrusion into the Concession to Arrest People: British Military Intercepts Four. Detained and Disarmed on Dunsing Road. Detained at the Jing'an Temple Police Station.

Four fake police officers attempted to arrest people on Dunsing Road in West Shanghai yesterday morning and were intercepted by the British defense forces and escorted to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for detention. As of late last night, they were still spending the night at the police station. According to a reporter from the Great China News Agency, Mo Miaoqi, a Chinese broker for the Shanghai Milk Company, a Danish company located at 145 Dunsing Road, has a small factory in a village outside Dunsing Road. Recently, he was unlucky enough to have a fire, which also affected two neighboring houses, all of which were burned down. The owners of the neighboring houses blamed Mr. Mo, and since Mr. Mo had not provided a satisfactory response, they filed a complaint with the Caohejing Fake Police Station. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Mr. Mo was walking past the area when four fake police officers approached him to arrest him. Mr. Mo fled, and a patrol of the West Forfarshire Regiment of the Central Army happened to be passing by. Considering that jurisdiction did not fall under the fake police and that the fake police dared to carry weapons and threaten pedestrians on the Public Works Department's road and in the British military's defense zone, they captured the four fake police officers, disarmed them, and escorted them to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station for detention. What kind of measures the police station and the British military authorities will take is currently unknown.

### Management Committee Issues Public Notice to Stop Illegal Rice Market Transactions. Arrivals are High, Inventory is Increasing Daily. Admits Chaotic Market Conditions, Disguised Crackdown on Hoarding.

The Rice Shop Teahouse Market Management Committee issued Public Notice No. 102 yesterday, stating that arrivals of rice are high and inventories are increasing daily. However, the market is chaotic, and this is related to people's food and security, which is not acceptable. Therefore, after the 54th Market Management Committee meeting, it was resolved that the decisions made by the Joint Meeting of Rice Industry Organizations convened by the Doumi Industry General Association, the market trading rules must be strictly observed.

All Transactions Must Be Documented

Regardless of the type of transaction, a contract must be used. Brokers must also use brokerage slips. Before the goods are sold, a sample receipt must be issued. Only by implementing the resolutions can business be conducted properly. Any transaction that violates the rules and does not have proper documentation will be considered an illegal transaction. Once discovered, it will be immediately reported to the General Association for disciplinary action. The order of sales is listed as follows:

Illegal to Trade Out of Turn

(1) Goods must be sold with a sample receipt, and can only be sold to industry counterparts in the market. (2) Brokers are essentially selling on behalf of customers, and the goods sold can only be sold to rice shops. (3) Rice shops can only sell the goods they have purchased to consumers. Any transaction that does not follow the above order and trades out of turn is considered an illegal transaction. Starting from the 5th of this month, the resolutions will be implemented. In addition to notification, this is a special public announcement for compliance. This notice is issued.

Temporary Suspension for Disregarding Regulations

The Yichangyong Rice Shop in this city has repeatedly ignored mediation by the Rice Shop Teahouse Market Management Committee and the Doumi Industry Association regarding compensation for damages due to the return of goods from the Daxing Rice Shop. Letters were sent on October 26th and November 7th, but there was no response. Subsequently, a third letter was sent on November 27th, urging a resolution within three days, with a threat of disciplinary action. To this day, the matter remains unresolved. The Rice Shop Association believes that this situation cannot be tolerated and has sent a letter to the Market Management Committee to review and approve disciplinary measures, which will be implemented immediately as a warning. The Rice Market Management Committee believes that the shop has disregarded the regulations of the General Association and has decided at the 54th Management Committee meeting to temporarily suspend the Yichangyong Shop, removing its license and suspending its business. A resolution must be reached within three days for business to resume. This matter was announced to the market yesterday.

### Robbers Fail in Robbery Attempt: One Robber Apprehended, Box Cannon Found.

At 7:40 AM yesterday, five robbers broke into a residence of a certain family at 1537, Alley 21, Jing'an Temple Road. They threatened the residents with pistols, prohibiting them from making any noise, and ransacked the house, stealing over 60 yuan in legal tender. The police were notified and immediately dispatched armed detectives to apprehend the robbers. Two robbers were apprehended on the spot, and a box cannon pistol was found on one of them. The other three robbers escaped. The two robbers, along with the box cannon, were taken to the police station for questioning.

### Hotels and Restaurants Ordered to Pay Attention to Japanese and Puppet Personnel: Report to the Local Police Station Immediately. If Suspicious, Notify by Phone.

The Hotel Industry Association of this city issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating that all members of the Public Concession have received a notice from the Police Department of the Public Works Department, which reads: "It is hereby ordered that all those who hold licenses for hotels, brothels, warehouses, restaurants, or are managers of these businesses, if they encounter customers who are Japanese or personnel of the Reformed Government, or advisors to local officials from outside the Concession, must immediately report to the local police station. If it is not possible to identify such individuals before their arrival, then after their arrival, if you believe or suspect that there are such individuals, you should immediately notify the nearest police station by phone. Those who violate this warning will have their licenses temporarily suspended. It is hoped that you will comply with this warning." The Association believes that members face many difficulties and there is a risk of license suspension and business closure. An emergency meeting was convened on November 21st to discuss countermeasures. At the meeting, it was decided to appoint Chairman Xu Wenzhao to send a special letter to Mr. Robertson, the Western District Chief, explaining the difficulties and requesting understanding. Mr. Robertson understood the difficulties faced by the members and agreed to accommodate them to some extent. However, members must still comply with the above-mentioned measures, otherwise, if there is a failure to report known information and an accident occurs, leniency will not be granted and the license will inevitably be suspended and the business closed. Members are urged to abide by the law and not be negligent. This notice is issued.

### Moral Re-Armament Movement in China (Part 2)

A few years ago, a prominent Shanghai businessman joined the Moral Re-Armament Movement and transformed his indulgent lifestyle into one of social welfare creation. He redirected the funds he previously spent on extravagant banquets to refugee relief. A young store clerk, influenced by the Moral Re-Armament Movement, resolutely returned two thousand yuan that he had intended to embezzle to his manager.

Yan'dong University in North China has seen great success since promoting the Moral Re-Armament Movement, and many students have gained new life in the movement. In the summer of this year, the Moral Re-Armament Movement held a training conference at the university. Many attending guests were deeply moved, some recognizing the true meaning of life, and others realizing the absurdity of their hatred for their stepmothers. Clever but fickle students abandoned their dissolute behavior and adopted a serious attitude, pursuing the will of God.

After the training conference closed, these enlightened young people were refreshed and filled with new strength, volunteering to work diligently for the people.

Overseas Chinese have also expressed a warm welcome to the Moral Re-Armament Movement. On August 27th of this year, overseas Chinese in San Francisco held a mass meeting of expatriates, attended by over five thousand five hundred people, including news reporters, businessmen, students, group leaders, store clerks, and laundry workers. In addition to Bishop Wu Shide, who has lived in China for over twenty years, and Dr. Frank Buchman, the founder of the Moral Re-Armament Movement, speakers included the leader of the British Labor Party, a kilt-wearing Scotsman, a dark-skinned Burmese woman, an Australian businessman, and several Chinese representatives, all sharing their insights.

The following morning, the five major Chinese newspapers in San Francisco prominently featured the news and published a "Special Issue on the Re-Armament Movement," with circulation soaring to over twenty thousand copies. Chinese overseas communities along the Pacific coast, in Mexico and Canada, also received copies. The enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for moral re-armament is evident.

In conclusion, the Moral Re-Armament Movement has deeply penetrated the hearts of the Chinese people because it can improve individual lives and have a positive impact on families, society, and the country. To find solutions to commercial, labor-management, and organizational issues, there is no alternative to the honest, pure, loving, and selfless application of the four principles in personal life. May all our citizens strive for this!

### Moral Re-Armament Movement Continues Broadcasting: Conference Enjoys Enthusiastic Atmosphere. Weekly Broadcasts to Follow.

The Moral Re-Armament Movement in this city held a conference at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road on the fifth floor the other night, as reported in the newspapers. Here are further details of the conference:

Vanguard of the Masses

The conference began at 5:00 PM with a conversation session, followed by self-introductions. After dinner, there was a half-hour entertainment program, with Mr. Cai telling jokes and Ms. Bao leading games. The audience roared with laughter. Afterwards, everyone learned a song, "The Vanguard Team": "We are the vanguard team of the masses, unfolding the banner and moving forward. We are the strong vanguard team, dedicated to renewing the world. The bugle is blowing loudly, the masses are moving forward. We are the vanguard team of the masses, dedicated to renewing the world." The powerful singing invigorated the entire hall.

Four Standards

In addition to a banner at the entrance displaying the Moral Re-Armament slogan, highlighting the four standards of honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love, Mr. Tang Minghe explained the meaning of Moral Re-Armament after the entertainment. He stated that Moral Re-Armament is a quality of life, following the four standards and submitting to God's leadership. He also recounted the history of Moral Re-Armament and its relationship to the business community, the gospel community, the education community, the medical community, the film industry, individuals, families, and the nation. All those present listened attentively, with a very positive attitude.

Spirit of Friendship

Although there were strangers in the meeting, they introduced themselves, got to know each other, talked to each other, and felt like brothers and sisters. After the meeting, many were reluctant to leave, which shows that the great spirit of love in Moral Re-Armament and Christianity can touch people's hearts and change the world. In today's world of brutal warfare, moral re-armament is urgent. In addition to distributing promotional materials such as "What is Moral Re-Armament?", the meeting also displayed various books on Moral Re-Armament for attendees to purchase. The most accessible and fundamental book is "How I Started," a short ten-page book with illustrations. For various other printed promotional materials, inquiries or any questions can be sent to the movement's correspondence office at Room 723, 128 Museum Road.

Regular Broadcasts

In addition to the special broadcasts from the 1st to the 3rd of this month, the movement will also have regular broadcasts on the Gospel Radio Station every Thursday from 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM (English) and every Saturday from 7:30 PM to 8:00 PM (Chinese). All are encouraged to pay attention and tune in on time. Many major stores are displaying Moral Re-Armament slogans. The China-West Pharmacy, Minyi Pharmacy, New Asia Pharmacy, and Xinyi Pharmacy are donating advertisement space to publish the movement's broadcast news. The movement is deeply grateful.

### Managing Director of French Newspaper Goes to Japan

### Shanghai West Zhaofeng Gambling Den: Japanese Gambler Loses, Opens Fire; Tense Situation as Gamblers Flee in Panic; Japanese Military Police Arrive to Suppress, Incident Ceases

According to the English-language North China Daily News, yesterday afternoon (the 3rd), a conflict erupted among Japanese army personnel inside a gambling den in the badlands of western Shanghai. Shots were fired into the air, though no one was hit. Gamblers, terrified, fled for their lives. The gambling den in question is the

Zhaofeng General Association,

located behind the Wheeldon Tavern on Yuyuan Road. The owner of the gambling den, Gao Akang (transliteration), previously operated the Dasheng General Association at the Wujiaochang (Five Corners) area on Baidun Road, which has recently closed. The incident unfolded as follows: Yesterday afternoon, around 4 PM, three Japanese men, all in Western casual wear, entered the Zhaofeng General Association gambling den. They spoke Shanghainese fluently and were received and seated by gambling den staff. Before long, the three Japanese men had lost three to four thousand yuan,

unable to suppress their anger.

They accused the gambling den manager of using rigged dice and insisted on inspecting the dice before placing further bets. Naturally, the gambling den staff refused. Before armed guards could even be deployed, the three Japanese men drew guns and opened fire. In their rage, they spoke in Japanese. Other gamblers fled in terror. The gambling den operators immediately sought assistance from the "Gambling Den Supervision Department" at Lane 400, No. 9, Yuyuan Road, resulting in the arrival of

ten Japanese military police

to suppress the situation. Upon entering the gambling den, the three Japanese men fired several shots into the air. The Japanese military police, in "retaliation," also fired into the air. The three Japanese gamblers, ultimately outnumbered, were "invited" to the military police headquarters and later released. It is rumored that the three Japanese men were members of the Japanese Army Special Service Department. Whether or not they have repaid the debts owed to the gambling den is uncertain. According to rumors, the

gambling den manager

is willing to repay the debt in order to appease the Japanese. However, those close to the gambling den dismiss the shooting incident as insignificant, claiming that the three Japanese men were merely low-ranking soldiers. After their losses, they were quite enraged and took away the gambling den's license. The gambling den operators then sought assistance from the "Supervision Department" and have retrieved the license.

### Beloved Daughter Dies Young: Woman Commits Suicide by Poisoning

Mrs. Qi Zheng, a native of Ningbo and wife of the owner of the Hengyu Cloth Factory in the eastern Zhuanbang area of western Shanghai, was 26 years old. Last year, she gave birth to a daughter, whom she cherished like a pearl. Tragically, her daughter fell ill last month and died despite medical treatment.

### Child Kidnapping Case Near the Racecourse: Cook Suspected and Arrested; Temporarily Detained for Investigation

On the 2nd of this month (Saturday), the Shanghai Municipal Council Racecourse held its regular horse races. As a result, the area along Jing'an Temple Road was extremely crowded with spectators. Xie Chuncai, a native of Sichuan residing at No. 24 Tianlefang Lane, Xiejiao Road, is the accounting director of the Sichuan

Chongqing Bank

office in Shanghai, located at No. 221 Fuzhou Road. Accompanied by the bank office director, Shao Jigao, they went out with Xie's one-year-old son and Shao's three-year-old son being carried by their hired cook, Liu Guofu from Anhui, and a nanny. At 3 PM that afternoon, they went to watch the races near the racecourse. Unexpectedly, a kidnapper, acting alone, brandished a pistol and, using threats, took both children

along with the nanny

and forced them into a waiting car, which sped away. Liu Guofu then politely reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Chen Lianjing and Western Detective White to investigate. The incident was quite bizarre, as it occurred during daylight hours in a crowded location, yet the kidnapper dared to abduct the children openly, suggesting

ulterior motives.

Suspicion fell heavily on the cook, Liu Guofu, who was taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was brought before the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, presented the case and requested detention for investigation. Judge Chuan Lin, after questioning Liu, ordered him to be detained for seven days for further review.

### Bizarre Murder Case at a Restaurant on Guangdong Road: Employee Poisons Himself, Then Attacks Colleague with a Knife

Yesterday morning at 2:15 AM, the Old Zha Police Station received a report that a murder had occurred at the Mo Restaurant at No. 389 Guangdong Road. Chinese Detective Li Pengfei and Detective Zhang Bingchun rushed to investigate and found Ge Aben (40 years old), a waiter from Wuxi, had been struck in the head twice and in the arm once with a kitchen knife, suffering severe injuries. However, the restaurant doors were tightly closed, suggesting that the perpetrator was not an outsider. Upon further investigation, Shen Rongfu (25 years old), another waiter from Wuxi, was found with bloodstains on his hands and was taken into custody. Under questioning, Shen confessed that he had recently learned that the restaurant owner intended to

fire him, and he suspected that Ge had been instrumental in his impending dismissal. In his rage, he first swallowed three boxes of match heads, washing them down with half a bottle of wine. Then, he went into the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and attacked Ge in his room. Because he did not turn on the lights, his attack was indiscriminate. He then abandoned the knife and fled after Shen cried out. Shen confessed that his intention was to die together with Ge. The detectives then sent Ge to Renji Hospital and Shen to the police hospital for treatment. Ge's condition is critical, and his life is in danger. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer, Tian Yin, charged Shen with attempted murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. However, because Shen was in the hospital receiving treatment for poisoning and unable to appear in court, and because it was difficult to predict whether Ge Aben's injuries were life-threatening, the lawyer requested a postponement. Judge Feng Shide approved the request, ordering the hearing to be rescheduled.

### Hengjixiang Shop Owner Qiang Jicheng Accused of Forgery: Owing Thousands of Yuan to Meili Silk Factory; Qiang Suspected of Evasion; Matter Awaits Investigation

Qiang Jicheng, a native of Hangzhou, opened the Hengjixiang shop at No. 62 South Wuxi Road. In May of last year, he began doing business with the Meihe Silk Factory at No. 11 Tonglefang Lane, Jinning Road. At that time, to gain the factory's trust, Qiang offered a "compensation" of 2,000 yuan as bait to

induce the transaction,

and persuaded the factory to sign a contract. He then claimed a lack of confidence in sales and terminated the agreement. In October, Qiang accumulated debts of several thousand yuan to the Meili Factory, which repeatedly demanded payment without success. Unexpectedly, Qiang preemptively filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, using a preliminary draft of the contract that was falsely filled in with numbers and a forged signature of the factory's legal representative, Yang Zixiang,

seeking compensation

for losses. The hearing revealed that the contract was indeed forged, and the court ruled against Qiang, ordering him to repay over 1,000 yuan in outstanding payments related to the counterclaim. Qiang then abandoned his appeal regarding the forgery charge but appealed the payment order. The appeal was also rejected, and the verdict became final. Yang Qianxiang of the Meili Factory, based on the

forgery

charge, filed a private prosecution against Qiang in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The initial trial resulted in an acquittal, which Yang found unacceptable. He hired lawyers Yu Zheweng and Gu Peilun to appeal to the High Court. Yesterday, Chief Justice Zhou Han heard the case. Qiang had already fled and was nowhere to be found. The court ruled that the defendant was deliberately evading justice and ordered a temporary suspension of the trial until the defendant could be located.

### Rickshaw Driver Murder Case: Killer Captured; Motivated by Adultery

Zhang Gougou, a 28-year-old native of Nantong, worked as a rickshaw driver in Shanghai and resided at No. 82 Wen'anfang Lane 16, Rue du Père Robert, French Concession. Every morning, he transported freshly slaughtered pork from the Shanghai Slaughtering Company in the French Concession to various small markets, meat shops, and stalls. On the evening of July 3rd of this year, around 9 PM, Zhang was sleeping outdoors near his residence due to the heat. While sound asleep, he was suddenly attacked with a sharp weapon, receiving

stab wounds

to the throat and abdomen, resulting in severe injuries with his intestines protruding from his body. He died before he could receive medical treatment. The police station was notified and requested the court to conduct an examination. His brother, Zhang Mingming, arranged for the burial. The police station ordered a search for the perpetrator. According to previous reports, the police station determined that the motive for Zhang's murder was his seduction of Qian Xiao'e (29 years old) from Tongzhou, the mistress of Cai Maosheng (34 years old), a fellow rickshaw driver from the same hometown who resided at No. 7 Dunrenli, Beile Road. He also

spirited Xiao'e away

causing Cai to harbor resentment with no outlet. He then committed the heinous act of murdering Zhang to vent his anger. When the police went to arrest Cai Maosheng, Cai had already fled to the Fahua area in western Shanghai, making immediate capture impossible. The police station then dispatched detectives to watch his residence. Cai, believing that the incident had faded from memory after five months, returned to his residence at 4 PM the day before yesterday to retrieve items and was arrested by the waiting detectives. He confessed to the murder, stating that it was motivated by

adultery

and other disputes. Yesterday afternoon, Cai was brought before Judge Sun Penghuan of the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for questioning. Police lawyer Gu Shouxu presented the case, stating that the police department needed to further investigate the circumstances of the murder and requested a postponement. Detective Yang Zhongfang, who handled the case, reported the details of the arrest. The court reviewed the report, questioned the defendant, and ordered him to be detained pending further investigation.

### Two Grain Transport Ships Complete Resupply

The grain transport ships Liuxing and Haiguang of the Jianghai Customs returned to the Huangpu River the day before yesterday to replenish coal and load a large quantity of food, oil, drinking water, and other supplies. These supplies were for lighthouses operated by the customs authorities located on Yushan, Sheshan, and Tongsha islands off the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces outside the Wusongkou. It is now learned that both ships have completed the resupply mission and are expected to return to Shanghai from the Zhejiang Sea within the next few days.

### "Mian You" (Face Friend) Sues "Hao You" (Good Friend) for Infringement; Five-Year Lawsuit Resolved by the Executive Yuan; Good Friend Trademark Cannot Continue to be Used; Good Friend Manager Fails to Appear

Yan Bailin, the legal representative of Baichang Foreign Firm on the fifth floor of the Guangdong Bank on Jiangxi Road, and Ren Zhiwei, the head of the firm's business department, have filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, represented by lawyer Shen Yong. They allege that the Fubeikang Cosmetics Company, located at No. 33 Peifuli, Lakenna Road, French Concession, is infringing on the "Mian You" trademark of their products. They accuse Gu Peisun, the owner and manager of Fubeikang Company, of violating Article 253 of the Criminal Code by harming agriculture, industry, and commerce, and request a legal investigation. According to the complaint, the defendant previously registered the "Hao You" trademark for cosmetics. The plaintiffs believed that the trademark was deceptively similar to their "Mian You" trademark and filed an objection with the Trademark Bureau, but it was rejected. The plaintiffs appealed to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which overturned the Trademark Bureau's decision. The defendant appealed to the Executive Yuan, but the appeal was rejected. However, the defendant continued to use the original trademark, which constitutes intentional infringement of the plaintiffs' trademark. The plaintiffs requested a legal investigation and a cease-and-desist order to prevent the use of the infringing trademark. The court, based on the complaint, held a hearing the day before yesterday presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The plaintiffs and their lawyer appeared in court and presented their case, including various documents as evidence. The defendant, Yuan Peisun, did not appear but was represented by lawyer Chen Tingrui. The court, noting the defendant's absence, adjourned the hearing to 9 AM on December 9th and ordered the defendant to appear at the next hearing under penalty of arrest.

### "Sentencing" of Two Chinese Police Officers: Police Deny, Negotiating Release with Japanese, Solution Expected Soon

Two Chinese police officers, No. 1210 and No. 1460, of the Shanghai Municipal Council, were detained by Japanese military police on the 19th of last month while conducting a search on Rue Robert, following a conflict with a certain puppet official. They were handed over to the puppet "Shanghai West Branch of the Local Court" and charged with "attempted murder." However, the alleged victim, the puppet official, did not appear in "court", and the "trial" was postponed. Yesterday morning, rumors circulated that the two Chinese police officers had been illegally sentenced, one to twelve years in prison and the other to ten years of hard labor. A reporter contacted a senior official at the police station, who stated that these rumors were false. The official also told the reporter that negotiations for the release of the two Chinese police officers were progressing smoothly and that a resolution was expected within a few days. Well-informed foreign sources indicated that the Japanese-puppet authorities detained the two Chinese police officers to incite unrest among the Chinese police officers of the police station, but the plan was a complete failure.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Sir: According to my client, Mr. Liang Qihua, the recent news reports about Ms. Chen Qianwen fraudulently claiming funds from Citibank contain numerous inaccuracies regarding my client's role as guarantor and Ms. Chen's surrender to the authorities. On October 18th of this year, a friend, Mr. Shen Chuanren, informed me that Ms. Chen had received a remittance notice from Citibank, but due to slight differences in the English spelling, a guarantee was required for her to claim the funds. Upon investigation, I found that the address on the Citibank notice matched Ms. Chen's address perfectly, with only a minor difference in the English spelling of the last two characters. Believing that the address was correct and that minor spelling variations were common, I signed a guarantee in my personal capacity. However, the bank refused to accept my personal guarantee and refused payment. I heard nothing further until October 30th, when I received a phone call from the bank inquiring about Ms. Chen's whereabouts. After providing her address, I immediately went to her home to urge her to contact the bank. In the afternoon, I received another call from the bank informing me that she had not gone. I returned to her home and saw her mother, who seemed agitated and suggested that she had fled. I urged the bank to report the matter to the police immediately. At the same time, I felt that, despite the lack of a valid guarantee, the circumstances were suspicious. To find Chen, I waited at her house the next morning, December 1st, before dawn. Around 7:00 AM, Chen returned home and I took her to Central Police Station. All of the above is documented by the bank and the police. The claim in various newspapers that I am the manager or representative of Paramount Pictures is also inaccurate. I was entrusted to represent my client and correct the record with this letter. Please publish this letter in your newspaper's "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the facts. Thank you for your cooperation. Sincerely, Lawyer Hong Shihao, December 4th.

### Ministry of Education Reforms Moral Education Program; Revises Elementary School Civic Training Standards; Establishes Moral Education Organizations in Universities and Colleges

(Chongqing Dispatch) The Third National Education Conference this year passed the "Moral Education Reform Plan" submitted by the Ministry of Education. The specific measures for this plan have now been publicly announced by the Ministry of Education. The full text is transcribed below:

It has been widely recognized that moral education in schools at all levels and in social education institutions needs improvement. In addition to implementing the advisor system to correct the old practice of emphasizing knowledge transmission while neglecting moral guidance, the Ministry of Education is currently formulating moral education guidelines to serve as a standard for implementation in schools and social education institutions at all levels. However, the elementary school civic training standards need to be revised or established, the organization of moral education departments in secondary and higher education institutions needs to be established or improved, the advisor system needs to be effectively promoted, and the training methods for moral education personnel also need to be specified. The following improvement measures are proposed:

Measures

(A) Revising Elementary School Civic Training Standards (1) The Ministry of Education should revise the elementary school civic training standards in accordance with the needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. (2) Objectives should be added to each original objective of the elementary school civic training standards to ensure their proper use and direction. (3) The original wording of the elementary school civic training standards is somewhat abstract and does not fully encompass the four major objectives. It should be made more concrete so that children can easily understand and reflect upon it when reciting it daily. (4) Since the War of Resistance, the Chinese people have felt the importance of faith in the Three Principles of the People and the cultivation of moral values. The elementary school civic training standards should focus on enhancing students' faith in the Three Principles of the People and fostering love for the country and the community. (5) The content of the "Implementation Method Points" of the elementary school civic training standards is divided into principles, procedures, and methods, which seems abstract and difficult for implementers to follow. It is proposed to expand the principles section and merge the implementation procedures and methods, as they are largely similar in nature, into implementation methods. (6) The Ministry of Education will organize and publish the revised articles based on the added or revised parts for implementation.

(B) Formulating Short-Term Elementary School Civic Training Standards (1) The form and content of the short-term elementary school civic training standards will be compiled with reference to the elementary school civic training standards. However, because short-term elementary schools have a shorter duration than regular elementary schools, it is proposed to appropriately merge the provisions on regulations, items, and implementation methods. (2) Children entering short-term elementary schools are mostly the children of farmers and workers. In terms of regulations and items, adjustments should be made according to their economic capabilities and to enhance their understanding of improving agriculture and industry.

(C) Establishing Moral Education Department Organizations in Universities and Colleges (1) A university moral education department will have one director of moral education, and an independent college or vocational school will have one director of moral education, who will be responsible for the overall moral education affairs of the entire school or college under the direction of the president or dean.

(D) Improving the Organization of Moral Education Departments in Secondary Schools

(1) A moral education department will have one director of moral education, who will be responsible for the overall moral education affairs of the entire school under the direction of the principal. The director of moral education will also serve as the chief advisor. (2) The moral education department will establish a moral education conference, organized by the director of moral education, class advisors, and the heads of student training-related activities such as physical education, hygiene, military training, and Boy Scouts. (3) The director of moral education will be appointed by the principals of various secondary schools from among the teachers who have been certified as qualified by the Secondary School Moral Education Director Civic Teacher Certification Committee and will be reported to the competent educational administrative agency for record-keeping. However, when necessary, the competent educational administrative agency may select certified qualified teachers, submit them to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping, and then assign them to various schools for appointment.

(2) School principals should lead by example and take the lead in instructing teachers to fulfill the tasks of advisors, and the effective implementation of the tasks of advisors by the teachers will be one of the criteria for teacher advancement or demotion. (3) If the teaching hours of full-time teachers in secondary schools are indeed burdensome due to moral education duties, the maximum standard teaching hours (18 to 24 hours for junior high schools, 16 to 22 hours for senior high schools and their equivalent) may be appropriately reduced. (4) Secondary schools should strictly adhere to the regulations and prioritize the hiring of full-time teachers in principle.

### Participants in the Sino-Western Table Tennis League: 49 Teams of Men and Women; Men Divided into Four Groups; Captains' Meeting on Friday

The Sino-Western Table Tennis League, organized by the National Table Tennis Association, has 44 participating men's teams and 5 women's teams. The organizing committee held a meeting yesterday. The committee members present were Di Fei, Sha Sijin, Fuluo Mier, Bao Yisheng, Yu Binqi, Chen Linsheng, and seven others. The committee generally divided the men's teams into four groups based on their strength, with eleven teams in each group, as proposed by Di Fei. However, Chinese committee members Yu and Chen argued that since the teams were to be divided based on strength, it was not necessary to limit each group to eleven teams. Unfortunately, the Western committee members had a majority, so their proposal failed. The organizing committee has scheduled a meeting for team captains this Friday (the 8th), and will also hold a referee exam. Each group will have a silver cup awarded to the champion. The group lists are as follows:

(Men's A): Qingyun A, Youbang, Jingwu, Huayi A, Wanxia A, Hongzhang, Jincheng, Xinzha, Russian Team, Jewish A, Sukeer A

### Finance: After the US Dollar Reached $7, Chinese Merchants Massively Entered the Market; Settlement of Cotton, Wheat, and Tobacco Still Strong; British and American Final Results Still Slightly Tight

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with British gold revised down to two five, at four pence two five. The US dollar was posted at a small four three seven five, equivalent to six yuan eight seven five. Other exchange rates followed suit. The British and American markets saw mixed conditions, with the final results slightly softer. The opening saw the US dollar tighten, while the British pound was flat. Before long, the British pound showed signs of weakness, with British gold at four pence three four three seven five, while the US dollar had fallen to the seven-yuan mark. Besides speculative forces, many foreign firms were settling accounts, mainly for tobacco, kerosene, cotton, and wheat. Fortunately, the situation stabilized after US banks provided support. Then came news that Hong Kong Electric was selling £250,000 of British gold (or the news was inaccurate). At that time, Chinese speculators suddenly entered the market, reaching over one million US dollars, and the tightening trend was stalled. British gold returned to four pence four three seven five, and the US dollar also returned to seven yuan two five. After 11:00, sellers eased slightly, showing a slightly softer trend, but the closing price at noon was four pence four two one eight seven five and seven yuan two one eight seven five. The afternoon opened steadily, but after foreign firms bought again, the market tightened again to four pence four zero six two five and seven yuan one five six two five. Then, due to continued selling from foreign firms and Chinese merchants, the market loosened and closed. The final British and American rates both decreased by 0.03125, to four pence four three seven five and seven yuan two one eight seven five, but the US dollar's tightening trend was slightly weaker. The trend of futures was the same as the spot market.

HSBC's Official Exchange Rate Revised Down

In the morning, there were no calls from the London market, and the price of London gold was fixed. The exchange rate of British pound against the US dollar and the French franc was flat, while against Shanghai, it decreased by 0.03125. The exchange rate of US dollar against the British pound and the French franc was flat, while against Shanghai, it was a small triangle. The central exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was four pence four six eight seven five for British gold and seven yuan two one eight seven five for the US dollar. Compared to the end of last week, the British pound was flat and the US dollar was tight by 0.03125. After the opening, foreign firms bought for settlement, and Chinese merchants were also active. In addition, foreign support was weak, so the tightening was quite rapid. British gold softened from four pence four zero six two five to three seven five, and the US dollar decreased from seven yuan one eight seven five to zero six two five. The lowest prices were four pence three four three seven five and seven yuan. After HSBC announced the exchange rates, British gold was revised down to two five, and the US dollar was posted at a small four three seven five. The announcement of the silver balancing tax did not result in an increase or decrease. Afterward, a certain bank sold a large quantity, and the market stabilized. After selling this month's US dollar to Chinese merchants at seven yuan zero six two five, Hong Kong Electric soon released a large amount of British gold, and exporters also sold. In addition, many speculators rushed to sell, so the situation continued to harden. Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to foreign firms at four pence three seven five and four three seven five, while Chinese merchants, exporters, and American banks sold at two five. At 11:00, the selling subsided slightly, and there was a slight softening trend. British gold reached four pence four zero six two five, and the US dollar reached seven yuan one eight seven five. By noon, the bank's spot selling price was four pence four two one eight seven five for British gold and seven yuan two one eight seven five for the US dollar. Compared to the morning opening, the British pound was tighter by 0.046875, while the US dollar was unchanged.

The Afternoon Potential Had Turned Flat

Afternoon market conditions were initially stable. Later, due to importers buying again, the market showed a slightly softer trend. British gold reached four pence four zero six two five, and the US dollar reached seven yuan one five six two five. After 8:00, Chinese merchants sold again, and a certain bank also sold, so the potential turned flat. By the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was four pence four three seven five for British gold and seven yuan two one eight seven five for the US dollar. This month's British gold was four pence four zero six two five, and the US dollar was seven yuan one five six two five. Compared to last weekend, the British and American exchange rates both tightened by 0.03125.

### Foreign Currencies Strengthen Further; US Dollar Notes Once Reached $14.15

Yesterday's foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds were in strong demand, and the market was firm. British and American gold notes were actively absorbed by customers, and the market was tight. Although there were many fluctuations, softening was difficult. US dollar notes rose to $14.15. In the afternoon, customers supplied for profit, and the market declined slightly. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes were in strong demand, and the market was firm. Singapore, Dutch, and Annam notes were expensive. Canadian notes were rare, and large notes followed the trend of US dollar notes. The supply and demand of Japanese gold notes was not strong, and the evening market was at $1.251. Korean notes remained unchanged, and the evening market was at $1.138.

It began to fall back near noon, retreating to $48.50. In the afternoon, it rose again, reaching as high as $53, $10 higher than last Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 1.5 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Rumors of Hong Kong Banning Gold Exports; Gold Market Sees Many Fluctuations; High Point Reached $4255; Final Result Only Up $23

Yesterday's cash gold market continued to flourish, and the general mentality of buying gold was difficult to stop. Due to rumors that Hong Kong had banned gold exports, it was indicated that gold prices in Hong Kong were more likely to fall than rise, and that Hong Kong transactions would become narrower in the future. Conversely, it was thought inevitable that goods would be released into the market. However, the rise in gold prices after the morning opening was due to the continued tightening of the exchange rate, which made buying even more intense. The opening was $35 higher at $4200. Soon, it rose to a peak of $4255, with a certain gold shop and securities firm buying heavily, and a certain money exchange acting on behalf of a large account. Later, due to the exchange market turning flat, sellers were more eager to sell, and the securities firm and a certain gold shop also changed from buying to selling, so it fell back to $4165. Finally, a certain bank bought over 100 taels, and a certain gold shop came back in, so it rose to $4230. At noon, a certain securities firm and retail investors sold frequently, and the closing was down to $4185. In the afternoon, gold shops and securities firms continued to sell, and money exchanges also entered the market to sell, pushing the price down to $4140 for a time. Shortly after, the exchange market reported tightening and money exchanges bought, returning to $4210. As a result, the exchange market finally flattened, and gold shops sold again. Soon, it closed at $4188, up $23 from last Saturday. Trading remained active, with about 20 taels traded. Jewelry stores raised their prices by $5. Customs gold remained unchanged.

Cash Gold Bulls Emerge

Although the morning opening price for each tael (ten taels) was reported to be banned from exporting gold from Hong Kong, the sentiment in this city was very strong. Soon, it was heard that the exchange market opened sharply, and buying became rampant. Those shouting were like drunk and crazy. The opening was 35 yuan higher than last Saturday. A securities firm bought ten taels from a money exchange for 4200 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop and securities firm competed to buy. Although a certain money exchange acting on behalf of a large bull market took the opportunity to profit, the tight exchange rate was very strong, and many retail investors followed suit, so it soared another 55 yuan. A gold shop bought 20 taels from a money exchange for 4255 yuan. Later, the exchange rate stopped tightening and stabilized, and buyers gradually decreased. In addition, money exchanges continued to release, so the good times did not last long, and it immediately fell back 40 yuan. A gold shop sold 30 taels to jewelry stores for 4210 yuan. Later, although a certain gold shop bought back, close to 100 taels, and once again raised the price by 20 yuan, the exchange rate hardened, and securities firms suddenly shifted their target, with a large number of bulls released. Before long, a certain gold shop and retail investors also stopped buying and followed the sale, so the potential became even more unsustainable. It immediately fell back 65 yuan. A securities firm sold 30 taels to a gold shop for 4165 yuan. Suddenly, a certain bank came in and searched for hundreds of taels, and at the same time, a certain gold shop returned to buying intentions. Although a certain money exchange came back to release, the exchange rate was slightly soft at that time, so it rose again by 65 yuan. A money exchange sold 20 taels to a gold shop for 4230 yuan. Approaching noon, a certain securities firm took advantage of the high price to sell. The exchange rate had stopped tightening and turned flat, and buyers suddenly lost their appetite, pressing down a small 25 yuan. Later, jewelry stores started competing to sell, and then fell back 25 yuan. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange for 4180 yuan. Then, the securities firm sold another 30 taels to a gold shop for 4185 yuan as the noon closing price. The initial price in the afternoon was a small 5 yuan. A gold shop sold 10 taels to a money exchange for 4180 yuan. Later, the selling was quite strong for a time. A certain gold shop, securities firm, and money exchange competed to sell, and the buyers were scarce, so it immediately pressed down 40 yuan. A securities firm released 20 taels to a money exchange for 4140 yuan. At that time, the exchange rate suddenly showed a soft trend, and the buying wind followed, and money exchanges and securities firms came back to buy, and soon broke out of the 4200 yuan mark. A securities firm bought 30 taels for jewelry stores for 4210 yuan. After 8:00, a certain gold shop's intention to sell germinated, and at the same time, the exchange rate stopped tightening and turned flat, and the price gradually fell back 30 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 30 taels to a money exchange for 4180 yuan. Later, near the buying, it raised another 8 yuan, and money exchanges did 20 taels, for 4188 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose 23 yuan compared to last Saturday. It has risen for four consecutive times, a total of 322 yuan. After closing, buyers at 4185 yuan have a fluctuation of 115 yuan or more. The selling price of cash gold shops' wooden signs is higher than the cash gold, and the purchase is reduced by about 20 yuan. The current benchmark gold opening price is 50-60 yuan lower, and there are few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Rises Again by $5

The initial exchange rate for jewelry gold from jewelry stores was 420 yuan from Datong Bank. At 9:35, it was raised by 5 yuan. At 2:00 PM, it fell back by 5 yuan. At 2:30 PM, it was raised by 5 yuan again. As a result, Datong Bank changed to 425 yuan, and the new banks had the same price. The purchase was reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.

### Grain: The Rice Industry Has Been Rectified Again and Again; Rice Prices Fall and Still Rebound – But the General Trend Will Become the End of the Road

The rice market should be in the peak season of new rice coming out. With abundant stocks in Shanghai warehouses, it unexpectedly soared, which is indeed a strange thing. In principle, this kind of speculative manipulation, the rice industry has an organization to manage the market and should be deeply aware of its essence. If they do not collude with each other, they will be able to identify the treacherous and suppress them, but the intention is not entirely so. Yesterday, the Soy Rice Industry Association invited seven rice and grain groups to hold a joint meeting, to discuss remedial measures at length, to clarify the market and implement the rules. In addition to legitimate transactions among peers, outsiders are not allowed to intervene, so as to avoid hoarding and illegal manipulation, and to prevent people in the industry from bearing a bad name for outsiders. It was resolved that the market sales hereafter shall be limited to: (1) Guest traders must only sell to merchants with a bill of lading, (2) Merchants can only sell to shops on behalf of customers, (3) Sales to merchants. The above three parties must not transfer to each other beyond the rules, and non-peers are especially prohibited. For the sake of morality, personality and food happiness, everyone must abide by it. Yesterday, alarms were set in the market. In addition, with the initial arrival of 40,000 bags of foreign rice, and the continuous arrival of various sources, more than 20 vehicles of goods along Sujia Road, the bustling market scene in the morning, is difficult to rise again. The surface showed weakness again. In terms of sales, speculators have been difficult to act as a treasure trove and the national households are also tricky, and the native shops and stomachs are all watching with their hands on their sleeves. A kind of quiet air has been unseen for a month. The guest traders originally had unlimited hope, but at this point they have been broken, and they are trying to get out of trouble as soon as possible. Without an opponent, they have to seek a way out at a low price. In an instant, the shouting price was lower and the price of each item was downstream. When it came to about one yuan, the native shops took the opportunity to add purchases at a low price, and the market gradually became lively, and the price of each item rose again at this turning point, until the market closed and everything was restored, and the trend was less than before, and it was soft. For example, Chang Geng once fell to forty-one and two yuan in the morning, and the closing price returned to forty-two and three yuan, and the total transaction volume was only more than 5,000 bags.

After the arrival of a large number of foreign rice, the market of guest Xiantao gradually declined. The morning market of guest was two dull, and more than 3,000 bags of Jiangbei Xiantao arrived at the port. According to rumors, Jiangbei has 40,000 passport bags, which may be all packed out at this high price, so people's hearts are softened and the market once returned to a small six or seven angles. The sales were driven by price drop, and the price of Yangmi was difficult to set later, and the market returned to a halt. As a result, only a small one or two angles. The highest price must still be thirty-seven yuan seven or eight angles.

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice rose abroad. The orders have not been settled yet, so the spot market initially suppressed half yuan because 40,000 new packages were waiting to be unloaded, and the latter batches were also in transit. The importers intended to suppress, and the goods were also released, but the price fell and was attracted by the exchange rate and the rise in gold. The customers suddenly became cheerful, and the market rose again. An Nangeng still opened at thirty-eight places, Saigon thirty-seven yuan seven or eight angles, and a total of five or six thousand packages were opened in the market.

Imported foreign rice is coming in continuously, and more than 10,000 bags of rice were shipped from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (3rd). It is estimated that Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship shipped 13,314 bags, and transferred 4,500 bags of foreign rice to Tianjin. Taikoo's Yingzhou ship also shipped 7,389 bags, totaling more than 20,700 bags, which have been unloaded separately.

### No. 2 Flour Has Reached 8.2 Yuan in Cash; Flour Mills Release Prices and Purchase Wheat

The current flour mill price has started to rise again. No. 2 flour has been changed to 8.2 yuan in cash, a sharp increase of 4 cents from the end of last week. The market has become chaotic. Each mill only supplies local sales and restricts sales to merchants, so the turnover of warehouses is becoming increasingly popular. The cannon car brands are opened at 8.3-4 cents, but they are still rarely released. It is heard that the market for Japanese factory flour is once sharply raised by speculators. The Phoenix brand for December is opened at 7.38 cents, and then immediately returns to 2 cents 3 cents, with the lowest only 7.1 cents, but there is no formal market for it.

Wheat sources are scarce. The owners of the goods are holding on more and more due to the high price of flour. The delivery of the warehouses has repeatedly increased, and new records have been recorded. The mills have to release prices and buy. It is estimated that Shanhuanfeng Huaiban 8,000 bags, Fuxin 2,000 bags, Su Xichangzhou wheat are all opened at 12 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat 12 yuan 8-9 cents, and Pudong wheat 12 yuan 8 cents. It is heard that the difference in the dark market is as high as 4-5 cents, but it is not considered a formal market.

### Oil Market: How High Should the Oil Price Be to Suit the Hoarders' Wishes? Yesterday It Rose Again by More Than 10 Yuan

The oil market is being manipulated, and the news is being spread by general handlers. Yesterday's soybean oil market jumped eleven yuan compared to last Saturday's price (barrel oil must rise fourteen yuan). It is difficult to describe such a sharp rise. Statistics show that ten barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at a price of 117 yuan, 200 dans of local factory oil were priced at 94 yuan to 97 yuan, 200 pieces of Yanqi oil were priced at 90 yuan, 110 pieces of Qingbaiqi oil were priced at 89 yuan, and 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were priced at 88 yuan. Under the search and handling of peanut oil in Hong Kong, the price of canned oil suddenly jumped by twelve or three yuan, and 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened at a price of 82 yuan, an increase of 6-7 yuan compared to last weekend's market. Another 500 cans of Jiangbei canned oil were priced at 105.07 yuan, and 1,500 cans of Yantai canned oil were priced at 100 yuan to 106 yuan. Xinshen oil has been released by Shandong, with 200 pieces of goods on Jiaozhou Road priced at 86 yuan, and it is said that it was ordered by the market.

On the 4th, 45 pieces of tung oil came from Tianjin, and 180 pieces of raw oil came from Qingdao. On the 5th, 6,820 cans and 490 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong, and 300 cans of oil.

The soybean market was affected by the surge of 10 yuan in oil prices, which caused people's mentality to fluctuate, and they felt the tightening and rise. Various beans soared by one yuan. The buyers were oil mills in Huainan and local streets, and hoarders inside and outside the industry. It is estimated that more than 1,000 bags of Dingjiazhou beans were opened at 17.14 yuan, 2 yuan for Nanjing beans, 500 bags for Wuhu beans, and the price ranged from 15.9 yuan to 17 yuan, more than 700 bags of Chongming Shahuang were priced from 16.8 yuan to 17.5 yuan, and more than 100 bags of Pinghu Dudou were priced at 17.8 yuan. On the 5th, 4,220 bags of beans and 1,000 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Securities: Internal Debt Holds Steady, External Stocks First Fall Then Rise

The securities market in the gray market remained sluggish yesterday. Previously, there was a close relationship with the rise and fall of Shanghai Gold Bar, but now there is no longer any connection. Therefore, although Shanghai Gold Bar saw a sharp rise yesterday, government bonds remained silent, with increasingly sparse transactions and a more rigid market. Given this stalemate, there is no hope for a breakthrough in the near future. Therefore, apart from a few deliveries of food-related contracts, formal trading saw very few transactions. The trend yesterday was slightly weaker in the morning and tighter in the afternoon, with the difference in upward momentum being only about five fen to one jiao. In the end, only Category E performed slightly better by five fen, while two categories saw no change. Categories A and B were slightly lower by five fen to one jiao. The total turnover was estimated at over 300,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock Trading: Five shares of China Merchants Electric Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan each.

The General Chamber of Commerce reported that the exchange rate initially tightened and then loosened, while the stock market first fell and then rose. At the opening, various stocks were soft and lackluster, with prices slightly lower. Later, hearing that foreign exchange rates had strengthened, buyers gathered, immediately injecting activity into the market. Ruirong shares and Jianye shares progressed the fastest, with the former rising by more than one jiao in a single day. The current market trend is certainly viewed as upward. However, if the exchange rate weakens again, many floating positions will inevitably close, a point that must be closely monitored. Rubber stocks also showed considerable strength.

The ninth tranche of commercial shares of the China National Goods Bank will pay a dividend of 6% per annum, starting on December 5.

### Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton: Local Cotton Advances, Tong Cotton Reaches 165 Yuan

Local cotton trading remained active, especially among peers. As a result, market prices are advancing daily. This is because the tightening of foreign exchange rates has made imported cotton expensive, while Chinese cotton is relatively cheaper, so there are quite a few buyers who are optimistic. Tong cotton has reached 165 yuan, and Fire Machine cotton has also reached 160 yuan, both up 4.5 yuan from the previous day. Shenxin Factory also participated, but other factories have not yet taken action. However, Indian cotton has weakened slightly, but sentiment remains high. Cotton from Subei is available, with 296 bales of Tong cotton arriving, 602 bales from Changyinsha, and 2,590 bales from Beisha. Today, 330 bales were exported to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is listed on the left:

Tongzhou Cotton: 165.00 yuan, traded among peers, 491 bales

Fire Machine Cotton: 160.00 yuan, purchased by Shenxin, 1,000 bales

Straw Bale Fire Machine: 156.50 yuan, purchased by Maofeng, 25 bales

Also: 155.15 yuan, purchased by Tongren, 600 bales

Fire Machine Wood Frame: 158.80 yuan, purchased by Yuanyi, 250 bales

Jingjiang Cotton: 154.00 yuan, traded among peers, 559 bales

Straw Bale Fire Machine: 152.00 yuan, also, 200 bales

Tong Cotton: 162.00 yuan, purchased by Dechengxin, 500 bales

Also: 165.00 yuan, purchased by Yuanchang, 500 bales

American Cotton: 171.00 yuan, traded among peers, 100 bales

In other news, New York cotton prices have risen sharply recently. The market opened higher again this morning due to speculative buying, and overseas cotton merchants were actively buying, further strengthening the upward trend of American cotton. Short covering was intense, and the closing price was three to five points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton remained largely unchanged from forecasts, while Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten points. Liverpool was closed.

The trading of imported cotton in Shanghai has been particularly tense recently. Due to the tightening of exchange rates, most peers have profited handsomely. Trading by factories has slowed down, while peers are quite excited, so trading is still lively. Japanese spinning mills continue to order American cotton, with transactions of several thousand bales per day. The market price of American cotton yesterday, converted to the factory price at an exchange rate of 7.25 yuan, is as follows:

10 count, American middling: 204.50

Also, also, lower grade: 200.00

32 count, also: 212.85

Also, also, lower grade: 205.00

42 count, also: 216.55

Also, also, lower grade: 207.15

### Raw Material Prices Rise, Cotton Yarn Also Rises

The yarn market is trending upward, and the rising trend has not stopped. This is due to the renewed surge in the exchange rate tightening and the high cost of raw materials, which has boosted sentiment and intensified speculative buying. As for actual trading, the demand for coarse yarn from Hong Kong merchants is still relatively strong. Merchants from Sichuan, who have not been heard from for a long time, suddenly came to buy 20 count "Special Jincheng" yarn, and the packaging is almost ready for shipment. Therefore, although spot sales are not seeing significant growth, sporadic transactions are still decent, which is further boosting confidence among peers.

At the opening this morning, peers discussed lowering prices, but they were unanimously optimistic. Due to the high price of cotton and increased factory costs, the opening price rose by 20 yuan, with 20 count "Double Horse" yarn priced at 714 yuan. It was rumored that the exchange rate had tightened, and buying interest was even stronger, rising a few yuan further to 721 yuan. However, after the price increased, many sold off, and it fell back down by five to six yuan. The closing price was 715 yuan. Statistics show that 2,715 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20 count "Double Horse" yarn rose by 19 yuan, "Double Earth" yarn by 14 yuan, and "Fairy" yarn by 11 yuan. Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened sales of 1,100 bales of 20 count "Fairy" yarn over the weekend, priced at 690 yuan to 725 yuan. Yongan Factory opened sales of 150 bales of 20 count "Special Jincheng" yarn, priced at 715 yuan. Today, 265 bales of yarn were exported.

### On Fables (Part 1) - The Great Fabulist Aesop

— Zhao Jingshen

Speaking of fables, we think of Aesop. He was a Greek slave who was sold twice. He was like the imperfect characters in "Nai He Tian" and "Wang Hu Ting": flat nose, hunchback, thick lips, lame leg, and extremely dark skin. Therefore, he was named Aesop, which is equivalent to Ethiopia, meaning black person. Moreover, he was also a stutterer, and it was very difficult for him to speak. But he lectured on fables everywhere, which no one would have expected. There are many animals in his fables. Therefore, on the title page of one book, there was a portrait of Aesop, with many animals drawn around him. Monkeys and foxes stood on both sides, a lion behind him; in front of him, an eagle was biting a rabbit. On the trees above were peacocks, owls, and crows.

Aesop immediately demonstrated his wisdom while being sold. His life is almost a fable itself, just as Hans Christian Andersen's life is a fairy tale. On the road, when carrying things, everyone chose to carry the lighter ones, but he chose to carry the heavy bread bag. Everyone laughed at him. Later, as everyone became increasingly hungry, they ate the bread in his bag. As the bread was eaten less and less, the load he carried became lighter and lighter, and everyone became envious of him.

Socrates was martyred for philosophy, and Aesop was convicted for fables. It is said that Aesop offended the authorities because of the fables "The Frog and the Ox" and "The Oak and the Reeds." The former tells of a frog seeing an ox and reporting it to its mother. The mother puffed up her belly and said, "Is it that big?" The frog shook its head, saying it was "far from it," and finally tried again and again until the old frog's belly burst. The latter says that the oak resists the wind and is not broken, while the reeds yield to the wind and survive. The gentlemen were probably insecure, thinking that the old frog and the oak were referring to themselves, implying the collapse of authority, so they became angry and sentenced Aesop to death.

Aesop's fable "The Fox and the Hedgehog" was quoted by Aristotle in his "Rhetoric." Socrates also used his fables. In Athens, he also taught princes and the people using fables. Most interestingly, even his defense was a fable, namely "The Eagle and the Beetle," which roughly says that the eagle was cruel, and the beetle retaliated by repeatedly shaking its nest and breaking its eggs. But this was close to intimidation. So this time Aesop failed and was eventually pushed off a cliff to his death. It is said that after his death, his blood constantly cried out to heaven. Therefore, two hundred years later, someone erected a statue for Aesop to suppress it.

Whether the above words are true or not is unknowable due to the passage of time, but at least part of it is true. However, Aesop was not the originator of fables. We should trace the origin back to India, which is the cradle of fables.

### Indian Fables

Roughly speaking, the Persian Hitopadesa can be considered the father of fables. His "Donkey in Lion's Skin" and "Deer and Lion" were adopted by Aesop. His "Three Liars" tells of three liars who repeatedly said that someone's sheep was a dog, and the person finally believed it, which is quite similar to the story of Zeng Shen killing someone in China, which is also called "Three people's words make a tiger in the market." "Mouse and Saint" is also like the Chinese "Beggar becomes a beggar."

The story of the milkmaid originated in India. The Indian story of "The Brahman and the Rice Pot" roughly says that the Brahman had ghee and honey in a jar, hanging on a nail on the wall. He leaned back and lay down, looking up at the jar, frequently waving his staff, fantasizing that the oil and honey would be sold at a high price, and with this money, he would buy ten sheep; two years later, the ten sheep became four hundred; then he would exchange the sheep for cows; thus, groups of them would increase, buy fields and build houses, and even have a son. He thought, if this son is willing to study hard, that would be fine. If he doesn't study hard, he will hit him with his staff. When the staff hit, the oil and honey would spill all over his head.

In 1517, "Dialogue of Creature Moralised" was published, and this story became the fable of the milkmaid, roughly saying that there was once a woman who gave her daughter a gallon of milk to sell on the street. She sat down to rest on the road, and she thought of buying chickens with the money she sold, then from chickens to pigs, sheep, and cows. Since she had money, she would marry a decent man. She would ride to church with the groom on horseback. She made a gesture of whipping the horse, and with a cry of "Giddy-up!", the milk bottle broke. Naturally, this fable was translated from Latin. The path often went from India to Persia to Greece and then to various European countries.

Joseph Jacobs cited the example of the leopard and the sheep from the Indian "Jataka." The leopard falsely accused the sheep of stepping on its tail. The sheep said, "Your face is facing me, how can I step on your tail?" The leopard said, "My tail is so long that it reaches all sides, so you stepped on it." The sheep said, "I flew." The leopard said, "When you flew, you startled the other beasts, and the other beasts stepped on my tail." Later, the Greek fable deleted the monstrously long tail and the flying sheep, making it a more rational fable.

Let us now cite two more fables to prove the wide spread of fables; they are truly like dandelion seeds, sown by the wind.

For example, "Donkey in Lion's Skin" tells of Sakyamuni being born into a farming family and making a living by plowing the land. He saw a donkey wearing a lion's skin, and the villagers dared not approach it. Later, they gathered a crowd with weapons, and the donkey, frightened, brayed, and was thus exposed. Buddha said in verse: "This is not a lion's roar, not a tiger or a leopard, covered with a lion's skin, a vile donkey brayed wildly." ("Jataka" 189)

"This is not a lion's roaring,

Nor a tiger, nor a panther's;

Dressed in a lion's skin,

'Tis a wretched ass that roars!’

This fable is also found in Aesop's fables. According to Professor Benfey, this fable is also found in medieval French, German, and Turkish. Shakespeare's "King John" quoted this fable in Act II, Scene I and Act III, Scene I.

"Jataka" 215 is about "The Talkative Turtle." The Buddha was reincarnated as the prime minister's son and served as an advisor to the king. It happened that the talkative turtle fell from the tree branch held in the mouths of two wild ducks and died in the royal court. The Buddha advised the king with the principle of "Don't talk too much, too much talk leads to failure." Similar legends exist in Greek, Roman, Arabic, Persian, and various European languages.

From the above, we can see the fluidity of fables.

### In Memory of Miss Hulewski - Prose Poem No. 19 -

— by Gniev, translated by M.R.

In a desolate village in Bulgaria, in a field hospital temporarily converted from a dilapidated hut, she lay dying of severe typhus on the filthy, damp, and moldy straw.

She had lost consciousness, but no doctor came to see her. Only the sick soldiers she had cared for when she was still able to get out of bed took turns getting up from their beds to pour a few drops of water from the damaged pot onto her parched lips.

She was young and beautiful, and people in high society knew her. Even many nobles loved her wholeheartedly, women envied her, men flattered her... and two or three truly loved her secretly. Life had smiled at her, but what followed was a smile more painful than tears.

A gentle and sensitive heart... and the power of sacrifice and thirst - what noble things. No one knew, and naturally no one will know now.

Oh, what else is needed? Her wish for sacrifice has been fulfilled... she has completed her work.

Sadly, not even many people showed any gratitude to her corpse, although she shrank back and was shy of all gratitude.

I venture to place this bouquet of flowers on her tomb, I beg her forgiveness!

### "Broken Moon"

— Lu Di

Strolling along the riverbank, the river wind brought a hint of coldness. Watching the glassy sycamore leaves drift down, the autumn sound of Jiangnan drifted so far away.

I think of a distant day, there were cannons there, by the river of the shipyard, a silver trace like tonight -

The river surface gently draped in white gauze, fishing boats shaking their oars, and casting their nets, the great river embracing the flagship, the long sky reverberating with melodious bugle calls...

With an excited mood, I sat on the newly built embankment of the naval hospital, watching the river dim again. A friend suddenly became excited:

"Look: the moon - is - broken!"

"The moon is broken!" I looked up at the sky, the night was vast, the stars were sparsely embedded, and the new moon, like a silver boat, sank into the sea of clouds.

"Yes, the moon is broken, sometime we will always have to fix the moon."

My friend looked at me, and then silently fixed his gaze on the flagship in the river.

The days drifted by, the silver dream still had a deep trace. Later, that friend published a journal, and a picture beautifully unfolded in my eyes - the moon was shattered by the wind and clouds. In the light and shadows of the guns, someone spread their wings and bravely flew towards the "Broken Moon"...

"We should sing passionately, we should shout enthusiastically, and afterwards, let us create beautiful memories well. 'Broken Moon' should be the trumpet of the era's advance--"

So, at dawn and dusk, there were stirring songs of friends everywhere; and when a bugle sounded, a gun fired, and the flames of war spread, in the air school, in the army, in the mountains and forests, in the wilderness... all the friends spread their wings and flew up...

Iron symbols and iron beliefs intertwined to form iron strength, iron links; two years later, the sound of wild geese came again from the distant mountains!

"...Song has died for his country, Lu is still sick, Kai is left in that deep mountain valley, but 'For my beloved motherland, we must endure all sacrifices, all hardships, our lives belong to the motherland, look at the warriors who regard death as home'..." On Double Ten Day, we will embark on the journey to the front line again. (Note) Tell Jun, tell Bin, don't forget that moonlit night, the belief of that 'Broken Moon'..."

Two years have passed, the silver trace will always make me linger. Watching the "Broken Moon" quietly reveal a corner in the clouds. The sounds of the city have receded like a tide, and there are sleeping souls under every gray eaves! Beautiful memories are being created firmly, and in the sound of marching footsteps, the sound of silver flutes came out--

"The 'Broken Moon' is still the trumpet of the era's advance, and - you who are flying far away, are even stronger and happier - in the struggle, there will be our laughing 'sky-blue life'."

"Note" The fifteenth class of the Central Military Academy graduated on this day and were assigned to service. (Moved to donate winter clothes)

### Seeking

— Jin Mang

I will never look at the stars again,

Asking the stars to shine my eyes;

I will never weave the purple-red dream rope again...

My heart and bare feet put on straw sandals,

Walking a thousand miles to the desert.

Not afraid of the hot sand grains rubbing against my ankles,

Blood drying on the wound becomes hard boots.

Striding across the wilderness,

Running in the grassland,

Let the night cover the sky and the earth,

Darkness cannot stop the hot seeking...

Let my mouth pant in silence,

The leap in my heart has already raised a song,

No fatigue, worries, or hesitation.

Tighten my pace,

Shame for every delayed foot;

Life melts into the road under my feet...

The Arts

### New Scientific Magic Performance

— Li Shi

The "shadow" of a person can use the power of electricity to do everything a person can do on the screen. This kind of "cinematic" "technique" has long been regarded as an extremely common phenomenon. But if "I" can shake hands with my own shadow, it must be said that it is a rare thing. However, an American scientific magician has actually invented it successfully.

The fact is this? As long as "I" sit next to a cloth screen coated with a phosphorescent substance, this phosphorescent substance, once exposed to light, reflects the light. A human shadow immediately remains on the screen. This shadow is the part that is shielded by the human body and does not receive light, so it does not produce phosphorescence. So "I" raise my hand to "my shadow" and can give a deep "long handshake." If you like to joke, it would be quite interesting to have "I" and "my shadow" kiss for some psychological comfort.

### Zhang Wenjuan Becomes a Disciple of Zhang Rongkui

— A Person Who Knows Everything

The two masters and disciples: will definitely go north this year

Recently, the actresses of the small theaters are ambitious and have aspirations. Qiu Ledi has already gone north with his father to study with a master, preparing to be introduced by Meng Xiaodong to become a disciple of Yu Shuyan. Want to know what happens next? There will definitely be a sequel.

Zhang Wenjuan was originally the leader of the male roles in the small theaters. There have been several rumors of her going north, but none of them materialized. Now there are plans to go north again, and it is likely to happen within this year. Before going north, she formally became a disciple of Zhang Rongkui.

This apprenticeship ceremony was held at 4 pm the day before yesterday (the 3rd) at Jingtuan Nunnery. Not many people came, only Xu Muyun, Ding Muqin, and a few others. After burning incense and performing the great ceremony, they feasted at Huibin Restaurant, with one table of people.

Many of Zhang Wenjuan's plays were originally told to her by Zhang Rongkui. After the apprenticeship ceremony was formally held, he intensified his work of teaching her plays, deciding to take her to Beiping next month. Before going, he also plans to perform for a few days in a theater to raise some money.

When Zhang Wenjuan returns after mastering her art, her popularity will be strong. Hopefully she will be like the current Wang Yurong, who is also from the south. Wang Yurong raised the eyebrows of the southern female roles, and Wenjuan will then boost the morale of the southern female male roles, both belonging to the "strength of the South."

### Anecdotes from the Stage

— Zhu Yuanshi

Zhi Shulan, who guest starred in "The Weaver Girl Descends to Earth," has recently been strongly invited by Shanghai Guang Theater in this city and has decided to come to Shanghai from Hong Kong to perform during the New Year's Day of the Lunar Calendar. It is said that her stay will be at most half a month.

Zhu Qiuhen has joined Guohua Films and is rumored to perform in the new film "Du Shiniang."

Zheng Xiaoqiu's script for "Pearl Tower" has been completed and has been reviewed and deemed satisfactory by the company authorities. Therefore, Zheng will direct it himself in the shortest possible time. The main roles have been selected: Bai Yun, Zhou Manhua, Chen Jingfang, and Yun Guangzhao, among others.

Chen Yunshang has recently caught a cold and has requested ten days of leave from the company to recuperate. Therefore, Wan Cang's "Qin Liangyu" had to be temporarily suspended.

Wang Yin sent a telegram from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, stating that the filming date for the new film "Chen Yuanyuan" will be postponed by half a month due to various reasons.

Two copies of Yihua's new film "Wang Baochuan" have been entrusted to the Shanghai director of a certain American film company to be sent to New York and London for screening. It is expected that it will be officially screened overseas in the new year.

Tang Ruoqing has decided to leave Shanghai and return to Hong Kong in mid-December, and will not return in the short term. Her father, Tang Huaiqiu, has other plans, so he does not intend to go with his daughter.

### Notes on "Confucius"

— Qing Feng

Regarding the selection of the actor for "Confucius," it was widely rumored that Zhou Xinfang or Xiao Ying would play the role, but in fact, there were more than twenty other people on the candidate list. Director Fei had not decided due to various reasons. It was not until Tang Huaiqiu came to Shanghai from Hong Kong and met with Fei that he immediately decided to have Tang play "Confucius" because he was suitable in all aspects. Once this hurdle was overcome, the other actors were also resolved one by one in a chain reaction. In addition to Zhang Yi's son Zilu, who had already been selected, Pei Chong, Tu Guangqi, Murong Wan'er, and Xu Li, who had received much praise for their performances in "Ming Dynasty Regrets" at the Xuan Palace, will also participate in the performance. Fei Mu's fourth younger brother, the engineer Fei Tai, will not only help with the design work for "Confucius" but also play the role of Lao Tzu. Other actors are also being selected. In recent days, many scenes of the non-main actors in "Confucius" have been filmed. The makeup talent that Minhua once sought has been found. The other day, the director and actors conducted an on-site study of the makeup problems of each character. It is said that Confucius will appear in a play today and tomorrow. Recently, most of those who have been running around and busy at Minhua's door are film merchants, costume makers, headgear makers, antique dealers, and skilled craftsmen. It is certain that the future "Confucius" will be an eye-opener for the audience.

### Outside the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Two Young Masters in the Beiping Amateur Opera Circle

After Lao Tan died, Ju Peng also went to the sea [became a professional], so Zhong Si only went to watch Xiao Lou's plays. No matter which theater inside or outside the city, as long as it was Yang's turn to perform, there was no need to call to ask. Unless he was sick or had a particularly urgent matter, he would come nine times out of ten. In the past, when he and Yan San chased after and listened to Lao Tan, it was also the two of them, one memorizing the singing and the other memorizing the body movements, or one memorizing the melody and the other memorizing the lyrics. After the play was over, the two of them came back and compared notes, and they could understand three or two parts of the play. The next time this play was performed, they would go to listen together again, and they could get six or seven parts of the strength. At that time, there were no opera exams, and the old actors were secretive and unwilling to pass on the lyrics to others, so if you wanted to steal the play, you could only divide the work and cooperate, and study together. Later, Zhong Si chased after and watched Xiao Lou's plays, but the one accompanying him was not Ju Peng, but his newly acquired, extremely beautiful wife. This wife was young and beautiful, and looked somewhat like the movie star Hu Die, and she was also good at socializing, so her friends called her Hu Die. Zhong Si was old, had deep hobbies, liked stillness and disliked movement, but because his beloved wife liked socializing and dancing, this fourth master had to accompany her to social events. Sometimes his wife chatted and danced with others, and he just sat on the side and stared blankly. As time went on, he was given the nickname of "Foolish Master." (155)
