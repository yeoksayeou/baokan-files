### Overseas Chinese in New York Enthusiastically Welcome Bishop Yu

Bishop Yu Reports on the Situation of the War of Resistance, Overseas Compatriots Are Deeply Moved

(Chongqing) New York, February 13th airmail: Bishop Yu Bin left Paris on February 1st. Local overseas Chinese compatriots gathered to see him off. Father Jiang, a French priest who has been in Guilin for more than ten years and is extremely concerned about China, admired Bishop Yu's great personality. He personally escorted him to the Harpeng Port before departing, where the local archpriest hurriedly arrived on the "Paris" ship to see him off. He expressed to Bishop Yu that he represented the entire priesthood in paying respect to Bishop Yu. They understood the causes and consequences of the Sino-Japanese War, stating that all those who advocated justice and loved peace in the world believed that China's war of resistance was a battle between light and darkness, as well as a battle between the culture of Jesus Christ and barbaric warmongering. If China's war of resistance were to fail, the current world would inevitably regress two thousand years. Therefore, they were offering their most sincere prayers to this messenger of the culture of Jesus Christ, so that the great mission could be completed and justice and humanity could be maintained without fail. Their attitude was sincere and admirable. This demonstrates the sympathy of people around the world for our war of resistance. Upon Yu's arrival in New York, the local consul general and representatives of more than 60 overseas Chinese organizations, as well as American friends, were waiting at the pier. The local authorities even dispatched dozens of police officers to provide protection, which was exceptionally thorough. Important figures from more than 60 organizations representing 40,000 overseas Chinese were waiting at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, where a grand welcome ceremony was held. Chairman Huang Shangnong reported the significance of the welcome ceremony, followed by a speech by Bishop Yu, who elaborated in detail on the situation of the first phase of the war of resistance and the entry into the second phase. His conclusion was that Japan's attempt at a quick victory had been completely shattered. On the contrary, the Chinese side's strategies and tactics had made great progress, morale was extremely high, and the whole country was more united in spirit, unanimously and resolutely supporting the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the National Government. Overseas Chinese compatriots were deeply moved by Bishop Yu's speech, listening quietly for more than an hour. When he finished speaking, the crowd applauded enthusiastically, lasting for more than ten minutes. Overseas Chinese compatriots were extremely concerned about their motherland. Hearing this sincere account from Bishop Yu, they were extremely excited and rushed forward to shake his hand. When Bishop Yu left the meeting place, dozens of boy scouts were waiting outside to pay their respects. Its grandeur was rare in recent welcome ceremonies. (25th Instant Telegram)

### Expectations for the National Education Conference

The National Education Conference will open in Chongqing on March 1st. At a time when military affairs are so pressing, the government authorities are still able to pay attention to the long-term plan of education, convene the National Education Conference, and calmly discuss it. Such a spirit of foresight is truly admirable! Furthermore, this fact can fully demonstrate that in China's war of resistance, politics has already been put on the right track and is moving towards the road of national reconstruction, which is so gratifying and exciting!

Education cannot be separated from the actual needs of society and exist in isolation. It is very closely related to politics. Whatever needs arise in politics, education must and inevitably adapt to them. China, in the process of resisting aggression and building the nation, naturally requires educational facilities for resisting aggression and building the nation. Since the August 13th Incident and up to the present day, there have clearly been many reforms in Chinese education to adapt to actual requirements, and several regulations on wartime education have been promulgated; however, they are not enough to represent a systematic spirit within the entire structure. All theoretical systems must be built based on the experience of actual actions; the twenty months of resistance have provided sufficient experience to promote the establishment of long-term principles for resisting aggression and building the nation in the future. Therefore, the National Education Conference, held at this time, will definitely be able to absorb the actual experience of the past twenty months and organize it into a complete theoretical system as a facility outline for future long-term actions. We dare to wish the National Education Conference a complete success on this isolated island thousands of miles away!

What issues the National Education Conference will discuss, the representatives, experts, and government authorities must have meticulous plans; however, we, in scrutinizing the needs of the nation and the people, have the following expectations for the National Education Conference.

First, in China today, where the nation is supreme and resistance is paramount, education must naturally adapt to the needs of resisting aggression and building the nation. However, the so-called resistance is by no means limited to military actions; the so-called national reconstruction must go through a long process; therefore, education for resisting aggression and building the nation must have both comprehensive and long-term characteristics. This National Education Conference should at least accomplish the following three tasks: 1. Formulate practical plans for popularizing education, urging the government to extensively and earnestly promote compulsory education and literacy education, so that all the nation's citizens, regardless of age, can receive the minimum amount of education in the shortest possible time, helping to quickly complete the work of resisting aggression and building the nation. 2. Reorganize the various outlines of wartime education since the August 13th Incident, and then collect opinions contributed from all sides, agree on a plan, and request the government to revise the curriculum standards of schools at all levels, so as to make them suitable for the needs of resisting aggression and building the nation and the spirit of the national anti-Japanese united front. Although the previous curriculum standards were the crystallization of the minds of various education experts and had many excellent points, in fact, they clearly lacked a practical manifestation of the spirit of resisting aggression and building the nation; moreover, under the influence of the "Good Neighborliness" order during the 24th and 25th years of the Republic (1935-1936), the school curriculum was also forced to fade somewhat in color, and this past regret must be remedied at present. 3. Due to the fact that the mass organizations have not been sound enough and the fact that traitors are rampant, it is clear that Chinese education urgently needs to emphasize national spirit and increase the component of spiritual training. In the fields of both mass education and children's education, emotional cultivation and will cultivation must be given equal weight to the teaching of knowledge, so as to cultivate the universal and lasting spirit of the Chinese people, who would rather die than surrender to the enemy.

Second, China's past education, whether in guiding principles or implementing systems, has shown a state of disorganized steps and imitation of foreign countries; the fundamental reason is due to the complexity of China's social form, so education experts often focus on the needs of coastal and riverside urban societies, while neglecting the actual situation of the vast interior. Such unrealistic education is of course not very efficient; especially in the current extraordinary period of resisting aggression and building the nation, it is even more difficult to generate any positive effect. This National Education Conference should recognize this point, and in addition to meeting the needs of resisting aggression and building the nation, should correct the past chaotic and imitative pathologies in improving all educational principles or systems, and build a unique Chinese education system. At present, China's construction center of gravity has shifted from the coast and riverside to the interior, which must have many practical problems that can promote the basic construction of Chinese education.

Third, the National Education Conference should establish a plan for education in guerrilla areas, because in the vast guerrilla areas, there are many out-of-school youths and children, and the Japanese side and the puppet organizations are taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out their policy of enslavement education, and the Chinese side should quickly plan a method to remedy this. For example, allowing youths and children in guerrilla areas to study at home on their own, and then obtaining the equivalent of a school graduation qualification after passing a certain examination, but once they enter a puppet school to study, they will be deprived of this right. This is also a potentially effective method, and it is hoped that the National Education Conference will pay attention to it.

### Military Spokesperson Discusses One Week of Battle Situation

(Chongqing) The military commission spokesperson discussed the battle situation of the past week (February 15th to 21st). The fronts, both north and south, have become more active than the previous week. Our loyal and brave officers and soldiers, with the spirit of becoming stronger with each battle, are striving for continuous efforts. It is believed that the air force's brave men, killing enemies and achieving results, have already inflicted the most severe blows on the Japanese, making the people's hearts and morale more aware that victory in the war of resistance is indeed within grasp. Details are as follows:

(1) Guangdong Front: The situations on the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Guangdong-Hankou, and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways have not changed significantly. Japanese troops in Taiping, Dongguan, combined infantry and artillery at noon on the 16th and attacked Ze‚Äôan in one part, while another part landed in Nantou on the 17th to encircle. Chinese defending troops bravely fought back. By noon on the 17th, due to a significant disparity in numbers, the positions were slightly shifted. Subsequently, a large number of Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese troops from front and back, taking advantage of the night. The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses and collapsed in disarray. The Chinese army then recovered Shi‚Äôan. In this battle, more than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed, and a large number of guns, artillery, and military supplies were captured. The Chinese army is now pursuing the victory, and Dongguan may soon be captured. In the northern section, the Japanese troops in the Huaxian area have been attacked by Chinese troops everywhere, resulting in over a thousand Japanese casualties. The remaining Japanese troops are holding their fortifications to the death, having become turtles in a jar and will not be difficult to completely eliminate. Japanese troops in Haikou, Qiongshan, and Chengmai on Hainan Island have been continuously attacked by Chinese soldiers and civilians on the 15th and 16th, leading to chaos. Over 3,000 were killed, leading to large-scale massacres of civilians to vent their anger, building fortifications and engaging in stubborn defense. Simultaneously, on the 16th, they landed in Sanya Bay in the south of the island and invaded Yulin in an attempt to contain the Chinese forces. The Chinese army, aware of their scheme, has divided its forces to intercept them, making it difficult for the Japanese troops to succeed. Furthermore, on the 21st, several Japanese aircraft came to harass the vicinity of Chengmai and two were shot down by the Chinese, with the remaining aircraft damaged and fleeing.

(2) Shanxi Front: In eastern Shanxi, since the Chinese army surrounded Heshun, there have been fierce battles in the past week, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. On the 17th and 18th, large forces were dispatched to pursue the remaining Japanese troops fleeing towards Xiyang and Pingding. The Japanese troops fled in panic and were killed in large numbers. The Chinese army completely wiped out the Japanese troops south of Zhongtiao Mountain in the previous week. In the past week, there have been fierce battles in Jiexian, Anyi, Wenxi, and Jiangxian north of the mountain. On the morning of the 15th, the Chinese army recovered Zengjiaying and Renwumiao northwest of Jiexian. In the afternoon, they captured Guanzhuangzhen and Wangyukou east of Anyi. On the 17th, they captured the strongholds of Caozhang and Shuitou south of Wenxi. The Japanese suffered over 900 casualties, abandoning a large amount of equipment, ammunition, and supplies. Japanese troops in Henglingguan and Hengshuiba in Jiangxian have recently increased by four to five thousand men, relying on superior artillery fire cover for days, fiercely attacking Dongguanzhuang and Yaofengtou, and deploying large amounts of tear gas. Chinese officers and soldiers bravely fought back, with fierce fighting. The Japanese troops have so far failed to succeed. The day before yesterday evening, they turned to attack south of Guanzhuang, where Chinese ambush troops were lying in wait, leaving corpses everywhere. The situation is still at a stalemate.

(3) Hunan-Hubei Front: The northern and central parts of Hubei were quiet, with both sides in a state of confrontation. On the southern Hubei front, the Japanese troops were attacked by a large Chinese force at noon on the 15th. Due to the intense Chinese artillery fire, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and released a large amount of poison gas. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed, causing the Japanese to kill over 2,000 of their own troops. Chinese officers and soldiers bravely charged and killed, causing the Japanese army to collapse. That night, Jinshui was recovered. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards Heshengqiao. The positions of Jinkou and Huanglingji southwest of Wuchang were also successively recovered by the Chinese army on the 16th and 17th, destroying over 30 Japanese vehicles and capturing over 100 rifles. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to the areas of Duntou, Tongcheng, Beigang, and Wanjia Mountain. Chinese guerrillas also exerted great power, frequently launching strong attacks against the Japanese army, killing many Japanese soldiers. Yangloudong Station was also sabotaged by the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese water and land transportation west of Wuchang and north of Yueyang is completely controlled by the Chinese army.

(4) Henan Front: The war in southern Henan was quiet. The Japanese troops entrenched in Xinyang were heavily bombed by the Chinese air force the day before yesterday, causing heavy losses. Over 2,000 Japanese troops in Xinwu and Bo‚Äôai in northern Henan began to attack eastwards in separate routes from the 17th. They were ambushed by a certain unit of the Chinese army, causing extremely heavy Japanese casualties. They fled back along their original routes, where they were intercepted by the Chinese army along the way. The Japanese troops scattered and fled in disarray, with over 1,200 killed. Furthermore, over 2,000 Japanese troops, over ten tanks, and over fifty vehicles from Xinxiang, Xiuwu, and Xiaojizhen attacked the Chinese forces on the 18th and 19th. They were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, resulting in fierce fighting. The Japanese suffered over 1,300 casualties, destroying five Japanese tanks and over ten vehicles. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed and retreated. Additionally, over a thousand Japanese troops attacking eastwards from Qinyang were ambushed by a certain Chinese unit on the 15th, suffering heavy losses. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray towards Wuzhi, where the Chinese army pursued and annihilated over 400 Japanese soldiers.

(5) Other Fronts: In southern Hebei, the Chinese army launched a large-scale counterattack against the Japanese troops for days. In the battle of Qinghe on the 17th, over 300 Japanese soldiers were killed. In the battle of Daming on the 18th, over 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese troops fled in disarray, suffering a great defeat. The areas of Xiyang, Suzong, Renqiu, and Chengxian in central Hebei are also under continued siege and will soon be captured. Chinese troops in Fanchang, southern Anhui, inflicted heavy losses on Japanese troops attacking from Digang, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers and a Japanese battalion commander. The Japanese troops are now greatly exhausted and unable to attack again. In addition, the 3,000-strong puppet army of Zhou Xuanchen in Xuzhou, the 2,000-strong puppet army of Liu Hukai in northern Sui, and the 3,000-strong unit of Yu Zhiqian defected and returned in the past week, fighting bravely alongside the local Chinese troops. The Japanese were alarmed and felt a serious threat. Furthermore, in the air battle over Lanzhou, as many as nine Japanese aircraft were shot down. The Japanese air raid plan was completely foiled. As mentioned above, the Chinese army has repeatedly achieved victories on all land fronts, and has achieved great results in aerial combat, which not only exhausts the Japanese army but also causes great psychological trauma, which is enough to give the entire Chinese anti-Japanese soldiers unparalleled excitement.

### HSBC's Operating Surplus Exceeds 15 Million Yuan

(London) At this morning's annual shareholder meeting of HSBC, Chairman Peel stated that the major powers related to the Far East have clearly expressed their position, that is, to abide by international obligations.

Peel also stressed the importance of the major powers assisting the Shanghai Municipal Council, but did not criticize the British policy in the Far East. He also said that our important interests in the Far East's economic structure have made it our top priority to fulfill treaties and agreements. Although the Chinese government is currently unable to shoulder the responsibility of raising 400,000 pounds a month to meet debt payments, public debt obligations have been fulfilled as usual to this day, and default may still be avoided in the future. Although the Hong Kong business community has been adversely affected by the fall of Guangzhou and the blockade of other South China ports, no panic has occurred. We are prepared to look forward to this year's developments. Hong Kong's currency and finance are very stable, and we have no worries about the future. Regarding the increasingly dangerous state of Sino-Japanese relations, if mediation is not carried out early, the rift between the two sides will definitely deepen and become more difficult to mend. Peel continued to report on the bank's operating conditions, stating that last year's net surplus reached 15,296,621 yuan, assets increased by 42,000,000 yuan compared to last year, investments increased by 30,000,000 yuan, and acceptable loans and notes decreased by 59,000,000 yuan.

### Inspection Report from the Yueyang Southern Front

If the Japanese Army Does Not Receive Reinforcements, It Will Be Incapable of Attacking

The Road to Capturing Changsha Will Be Difficult to Achieve in Three Ways

Changsha Correspondence: Reading the Hunan Province war situation over the past month, the Chinese and Japanese sides have always been deadlocked in the area within thirty miles of southern Yueyang. At present, the Japanese garrison in that area is part of the 9th and 13th Divisions, and the puppet army of Li Shouxin and others, totaling less than 60,000 people. If they do not receive reinforcements, they will not have the strength to attack. However, what is worth speculating about is how the future war situation will evolve. At the end of the old lunar year, the reporter, braving rain and snow, departed from Xiangyin to inspect the front line. The scenery was excellent, with cold crows and solitary wild ducks. Xiangyin is thirty Chinese miles away from Changsha. Talents have emerged in large numbers since the Qing Dynasty, such as Zuo Zongtang and Guo Gaotao, the most famous. Sixty miles north of the city, there is a place called Yingtian, which was the garrison area when Yue Fei used troops in the Song Dynasty. Six miles north of Yingtian is Leishi Mountain, towering majestic, remotely facing the Nanshan Mountain in Yueyang, one hundred and twenty miles to the north, with sails up and down, serving as a pillar in the middle of the river. The reporter and a certain regiment and others climbed to the mountain peak and discussed the future war situation in Dongting. Dongting is two hundred and ten miles long, one hundred and fifty miles wide, with an area of 15,000 square miles. The normal water volume is greatest from the third to the fifth or sixth months of the lunar calendar, with a water depth from a certain foot to a certain foot. After August, it gradually decreases, and in winter, it is shallow and dry. Currently, residents have built embankment walls around the deserted land along the lake. The land along the lake is fertile and easy to cultivate, but there is more and more wasteland, and the lake surface is becoming narrower. To date, the entire Naxian County and parts of the counties of Huarong, Yuanjiang, and Xiangyin, which used to be part of Dongting Lake, have changed from sea to farmland. But today, from a military point of view, it is precisely because the lake surface is narrow and the depth is uneven that the Japanese army cannot apply its skills. The southwest banks of Dongting have many shallows, and the waves can submerge the top of the head. Even in the summer when the water rises, it is not easy for speedboats to dock. This is one reason. If Japanese warships want to cross Dongting to attack Changsha to the west, it is not permitted by the facts, because the lake water depth varies. Usually, boats traveling from Yingjing, Yueyang to Changde pass through a certain place to enter Changde. Japanese warships have a deeper draft and have no way to go directly from Yueyang to Changde. This is the second reason. Dongting Lake has thousands of miles of silt, and the water level varies. The Japanese do not have precise surveys. Remembering when the reporter was on the eastern battlefield, he read a Japanese map of Taihu that had been captured, detailing the water depth in any place, whether it was spring, summer, autumn, or winter, and the number of ships with a certain draft that could be moored. The maps also noted how much food was available and the conditions of local residents. Some of the Japanese army's maps even went into such detail as to be at a scale of 1:2000. The fact that they planned to invade us with such specialized cunning inspires even this enemy to be struck with admiration. Now the military maps that the Japanese army uses when penetrating deep into the Yangtze River are all stolen from the Chinese side and are incomplete. In a certain headquarters, the reporter was able to see the latest maps of the Yueyang and Xiangyin areas seized from the Japanese. One part was at a scale of 1:25,000 and the other at 1:100,000, and this 1:100,000 map was enlarged and printed in combination with the 1:25,000 map for use. There was no survey of water level depth, and even the land maps were not as detailed as the Chinese maps. Although the Japanese worked hard, they were simply exhausting their minds and getting nowhere. This is the third reason. With these three reasons, it is not easy for the Japanese army to use the rising water of Dongting to invade Changsha. Taking a comprehensive view of the Japanese army in northern Hunan and southern Hubei, there are three important roads that they can take to attack Changsha. One is to attack south along the Hunan-Hubei Highway and the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. This place has dangerous terrain, and the Chinese army is densely deployed, making it difficult for the Japanese to succeed. Another is to join forces with the Japanese army advancing west along the Hanchuan Highway and upstream along the Yangtze River at Shashi, disturbing Changde to the south. This is a major detour, and the attack is also not easy. The third is for the navy to enter the Xiang River by water. Although Dongting is large, this is the only way that is convenient for shipping. In the summer when the water rises, √ó thousand-ton ships can travel directly from Hankou to Xiangtan. However, the current situation is very different. If the Japanese follow this road to invade southward, they will first be blocked at Jiaoluoshi (the Japanese army has repeatedly used speedboats to harass this place, but they have been repelled), and then they will be blocked at a certain mountain, the third at √ó√ó, the fourth at √ó√ó√ó, and the fifth at √ó√ó. Among them, two or three are considered to be the most dangerous. Currently, the river ports and waterways have been heavily blockaded, and various battlefields have been deployed at each blockade point. The troops who are called "stubborn" by the Japanese army can rest assured about the defense of the lake. A certain division commander told the reporter, "If the Japanese army wants to rely on its navy to carry out its always proud amphibious landings and invade Changsha by water, we will see their feet sink deeper and deeper into the mud, and they will eventually be unable to extricate themselves. The vast Dongting Lake will probably be their burial place." (Dispatch on the 25th)

### Polish Masses Agitated - Hold Large Anti-German Demonstration

Chanting Slogans to Overthrow Foreign Minister Beck - German Officials Maintain Temporary Silence

Warsaw: Yesterday afternoon, more than five hundred young people, mostly students belonging to radical right-wing opposition parties, held an anti-German demonstration in Warsaw, gathering in front of the German Embassy and demanding that Danzig be united with Poland. The demonstrators sang anti-German songs, and police arrived and dispersed them. The demonstrators then sent a delegation to the Ministry of Defense, demanding that the authorities "liberate Danzig and East Prussia." After a while, the leader of the delegation resigned and declared that the Ministry of Defense expressed its gratitude to the students for raising this request to the military authorities. It is reported that another anti-German demonstration will be held tomorrow. (Haitong dispatch on the 25th)

Warsaw: Today, Polish news media and university students launched a large-scale anti-German demonstration. By evening, the anti-German sentiment had reached its peak. Several hundred students gathered in front of the Polish Supreme Command, seeking to see the military supervisor, Smigly-Rydz, and shouting loudly, "We are ready, lead us to Danzig!" They shouted continuously, but Smigly did not come out to see this group of people. According to the police, more than two thousand university students held a meeting at four universities, expressing fierce anti-German remarks and inciting public sentiment. They then went to the German Embassy, attempting to cause trouble. They were later dispersed by the police, and seventeen people were arrested on the spot. This anti-German demonstration is a response to the recent mass meeting held by the German Socialist Party in Danzig. When the Germans gathered there, they posted a notice saying "Poles and dogs are forbidden to enter," which was widely reported in Polish newspapers, thus arousing the anger of Polish students. (Associated Press dispatch on the 24th)

Warsaw: After Polish students at the Danzig Industrial School were expelled from the school by German students and National Socialist stormtroopers, university students here once held an anti-German demonstration yesterday. Today, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano happened to arrive in Warsaw, so the foreign ministry authorities asked the student union to suspend the demonstration, but the students refused and continued to hold the anti-German demonstration, chanting slogans to overthrow Foreign Minister Beck. The students first held a meeting at the Guangyi School, publicly reading a telegram from the Danzig Polish student groups, which described the incident. They then passed a resolution advocating a boycott of German goods, and distributed leaflets with the message, "Poles, the reason our compatriots in Danzig are in distress is due to the current government's pro-German policy." After the meeting, the students planned to march in front of the German Embassy, but were dispersed by the police, so they divided into small groups and headed towards the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shouting "Overthrow Foreign Minister Beck" along the way. They were again stopped by the police and were unable to approach the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition, anti-German demonstrations also occurred in Krakow and Vilnius. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that an anti-German movement had broken out again in Poznan, Poland, last night. A group of Polish university students attacked secondary schools and shops established by Germans, destroying their glass windows. Some elderly German expatriates were also beaten. Political figures here were extremely concerned upon hearing the news, but did not want to express any opinion before receiving details. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

### Serious Conflict Erupts Among Students in Danzig

Poles Will Not Tolerate Insulting Behavior by National Socialists

Danzig Free City ‚Äì A hotel in Danzig City, owned by National Socialists, refused to serve Polish people and posted a notice at the entrance stating "No Poles Allowed," sparking protests by Polish students. They passed a resolution demanding that the Polish government safeguard them from such insults to the nation. This attitude of the Polish students has worsened relations between Danzig City and Poland. It is reported that the resolution has been sent to the Polish Parliament and has been reported in Warsaw newspapers. Danzig City confiscated these newspapers. The Danzig Senate then lodged a written protest with the Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig yesterday regarding the tension between Danzig City and Poland caused by the students' resolution and newspaper reports. (Haitong Telegraph, 25th)

Warsaw ‚Äì According to news from Danzig Free City, a serious conflict occurred today between German and Polish university students in the area. A number of German university students, many of whom were members of the National Socialist stormtroopers, attempted to forcibly expel Polish students from the city's industrial specialized school, resulting in a clash. The Polish students were outnumbered and eventually expelled. Regarding this matter, the Polish High Commissioner to Danzig Free City, Mr. Chodacki, lodged a protest with the Free City's Senate and demanded that immediate measures be taken to protect the safety of Polish students. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

Warsaw ‚Äì According to news received by the Polish News Agency, the truth of the Danzig incident is as follows: After a conflict between German and Polish students of the Danzig Industrial University in a cafe in the town of Langfuhr, near Danzig, the German students considered the resolution passed by the Polish students at an anti-German demonstration the day before as an insult to Germany. Consequently, the university authorities have, since yesterday, prohibited Polish students from attending classes. The president of the Polish student association immediately protested to the president of the university. At the same time, the Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig also formally protested. (Haitong Telegraph, 25th)

(Paris) ‚Äì According to news from Warsaw, anti-German demonstrations occurred in many parts of Poland today, but none of the country's newspapers mentioned it. German diplomatic officials in Poland also refused to comment. It is reported that many university students in Warsaw held demonstrations in various parts of the city, protesting the current foreign policy of Foreign Minister Beck and marched past the German Embassy, shouting "Down with Germany." A number of members of the right-wing National Unity Party also participated in the demonstrations. In addition, students in Poznan also held demonstrations, demanding the closure of schools run by German expatriates, prohibiting German students from entering Poznan University, and severing private relations with German students. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)

### Italian Foreign Minister Arrives in Warsaw Amidst Anti-German Sentiment in Poland

Polish Newspapers Express No Abandonment of Alliance with France

Unwilling to Intervene in the Franco-Italian Dispute

Warsaw ‚Äì Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife arrived here at 12:30 PM today. Foreign Minister Beck and other dignitaries welcomed them at the station. Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at 4:00 PM. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

Warsaw ‚Äì Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife, accompanied by a large entourage and journalists, arrived here today. According to the planned itinerary, Foreign Minister Ciano will stay in Poland for five days. He will hold talks with government officials here for three days from the 25th to the 27th and attend various banquets. On the 28th, he will go hunting in the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest, and on the 1st of next month, he will visit Krakow for a day. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

Warsaw ‚Äì Regarding the visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the local newspapers all say that this trip is purely for goodwill purposes, and that the rapprochement between Italy and Poland is not directed at any other country. Political figures even claim that, in terms of Poland's relationship with France and Italy, Italy is Poland's friend, while France is Poland's ally. Therefore, Poland can only strictly maintain neutrality. "The Warsaw Post" stated that on March 10, 1938, on the eve of Germany's annexation of Austria, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck was in Rome, holding talks with Foreign Minister Ciano. At that time, the map of Europe had not yet changed. Although both Italy and Poland maintained good neighborly relations with Germany, they did not want to see Germany occupy an excessively dominant position in Europe, which was the reason for their rapprochement. The government-run "Polish Express" stated that after Foreign Minister Ciano's visit, the attitudes of Italy and Poland towards the countries in the Danube River basin and the Balkan Peninsula could be explained. In addition, "The Polish Post" stated that Italy and Poland are cooperating economically to resist Germany's expansion of influence in the Balkan Peninsula. It also said that Foreign Minister Beck had issued a statement in advance, saying that the Mediterranean Sea is far from Poland and does not directly involve Polish interests, to show that Poland is unwilling to intervene in the Franco-Italian dispute. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

### French Chamber of Deputies Expresses Confidence in Government

(Paris) ‚Äì When the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon, Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech, saying, "When the Cabinet holds a State Council meeting on the 27th of this month, I intend to propose recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government. We have always admired the heroic resistance of the Spanish government army. Now, our country's border is adjacent to the territory of the Spanish Nationalist government for 600 kilometers. Even if the Spanish Republican government continues to resist, unless it receives massive supplies of personnel and armaments, it may not be able to sustain itself for more than a few weeks, let alone win. The President of that country, Aza√±a, also shares this feeling. It can be seen that the French government's recognition of the Nationalist government is inevitable. Moreover, the British government formally notified our country on the 22nd of this month that the time to recognize the Nationalist government has come and should not be missed. It seems that for the sake of the linked relationship between Britain and France, the French government also has sufficient reason to do so. I dare say that Britain has decided to announce its recognition of the Nationalist government within the next week. Our country can cooperate with it to promote a broad policy and, if necessary, closely monitor the preservation of Spain's independence and sovereignty." In short, the interests that France has in Spain are extremely important. Whether from an international or national standpoint, there is reason to send an official representative to Burgos, Spain, he said. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, members of various left-wing parties, such as Independent Socialist Party member Faucillon, Socialist Party member Etorrain, and Communist Party member Bond, spoke in succession, expressing their opposition. They all said that France should not recognize the Nationalist government until the troops of Germany and Italy withdraw from Spain. Issaurrain also said that when Colonel Louis, the former Nationalist commander of the Spanish island of Majorca, took the British cruiser "Devonshire" to Mahon, Minorca, to discuss a peaceful takeover with the government army authorities, Italian pilots bombed the island, indicating that the Italian troops belonging to the Spanish Nationalist army obeyed the orders of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, not General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army. At this point, Prime Minister Daladier proposed a vote of confidence, asking to postpone the discussion of the questions raised by members of the left-wing parties. The Chamber immediately voted in favor with 323 votes against 261. Those who voted in favor included 85 members of the Radical Socialist Party, as well as all members of the central and right-wing parties. Those who voted against were all members of the Socialist and Communist parties, 15 members of the Radical Socialist Party, and 12 members of the Independent Socialist Party. In addition, 12 members of the Radical Socialist Party abstained from voting. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)

### Franco Firmly Guarantees No Innocent Will Be Punished

Maintain Good Relations with Britain and France

Post-War Reconstruction Requires Financial Assistance from Both Countries

(London) ‚Äì It is widely believed in Britain that the Franco government will be recognized on February 27. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce this in Parliament at the same time as French Prime Minister Daladier. The current whereabouts of Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negr√≠n are uncertain in London, but it is known that he is near Valencia and will inevitably leave the country sooner or later. According to news received here, the only one in the Republican government who advocates continuing the war is Negr√≠n. It is said that the recognition of Franco will not be subject to conditions, but the exchange of views between British and French representatives Hodgson and P√©tain in Burgos with the Nationalist government has clarified everything in a beneficial way. Franco has stated to Hodgson that Mussolini's promise to withdraw troops is being fulfilled. Responsible parties expressed their satisfaction with Franco's intention to have purely Spanish troops occupy Tangier Island. As for retaliation, Franco has repeatedly assured Hodgson that no innocent people will be punished. It is widely believed that Franco, like the French, is eager to maintain good relations between France and Spain. After the end of the Spanish Civil War, Franco will have a long-term task of reconstruction and pacification at home, and no countries have sufficient financial resources to assist Franco more than Britain and France. (Reuters, 24th)

(London) ‚Äì According to news obtained here, General Franco has given Sir Hodgson, the British representative to the Spanish Nationalist army, a written guarantee regarding the issues of retaliation and the integrity of Spanish territory. It is the general opinion here that the Duke of Alba, who served as General Franco's representative to the UK after the British recognition of the Nationalist government, will naturally be promoted to Spanish Ambassador. (Reuters, 25th)

### Time Ripe for Britain and France to Recognize Franco's New Regime

Both Governments Will Officially Announce Simultaneously Tomorrow

Spanish War Nears End, Aza√±a to Resign as President

(Paris) ‚Äì When the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon, Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech, announcing that when the Cabinet holds a State Council meeting on the 27th of this month, he would propose recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government, stating that this move was due to strategic reasons, as the French border is adjacent to the territory of the Spanish Nationalist government for 600 kilometers, and the continued resistance of the Spanish Republican government can only last for a few weeks at most. Under such circumstances, France should establish diplomatic relations with the Nationalist government. Prime Minister Daladier then immediately proposed a vote of confidence, and the Chamber immediately voted in favor with 323 votes against 261. According to responsible parties, Britain and France will simultaneously announce their recognition of the Nationalist government on the 27th of this month. People from the Spanish Republican government here said that once Britain and France officially announce this, the country's President Aza√±a will resign and leave Paris. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)

(Paris) ‚Äì Spanish Republican President Aza√±a, currently stationed at the country's embassy, is said to be planning to announce his resignation tomorrow and retire to the town of Collonge-sous-Sal√®ve in the Savoie region that evening. In addition, according to news from Madrid, Spain, the country's government army authorities will also cease resistance. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

### Franco-Spanish Negotiations Reach Compromise, Three Documents Signed

Burgos ‚Äì After talks between French representative and right-wing Senator P√©tain and Nationalist government councilor and Foreign Minister General Jordana, an agreement has been signed, divided into three sections. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

Burgos ‚Äì After a final decisive talk between the French right-wing senator yesterday with Nationalist government councillor and Foreign Minister General Jordana, he gave a statement that evening to a Havas News Agency interviewer, "I came here on government orders to prepare for the establishment of normal relations between France and the Spanish Nationalist government. This mission has now been completed. I cannot tell you the details of the talks, but I can say that the process and result are both extremely satisfactory. In short, my task was to prepare for the future and resolve various pressing issues." According to well-informed sources, the agreement reached last night between P√©tain and General Jordana was deemed satisfactory by both parties. In addition to personally negotiating with P√©tain, General Jordana also participated in the drafting of the agreement himself, showing great diligence. As for the final communiqu√© announcing the results of the negotiations, originally scheduled to be released last night, it has been decided to postpone it until the 27th of this month.

In addition, the resumption of postal, telegraph, road, and railway traffic between France and the Nationalist government's territory will be resolved by experts from both sides. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

(Paris) ‚Äì The reason why the French government decided to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government without waiting for P√©tain to return to the country is that the recognition was not subject to any conditions. P√©tain's mission was limited to resolving various technical issues, such as: (1) The repatriation of Spanish refugees who fled to France; (2) The issue of the disposition of 1,800,000,000 pesetas (Spanish currency) deposited by the Spanish Bank in the Bank of France; (3) The disposition of Spanish ships anchored in French ports and Spanish armaments stored in French territory; (4) The protection of French interests in Spain. (Havas Telegraph)

### Candidates for British and French Ambassadors to Spain

Lord Londonderry a Likely Choice in Britain

High Hopes for Lilar

(London) ‚Äì After Britain recognizes the Nationalist government, the British ambassador to the government army's territory will also lose his diplomatic powers. London is now looking for a compromise solution to appoint another diplomatic representative to be stationed in the government army's territory, while the British interests in the government army's territory will be managed by the consulate. The selection of the first British ambassador to Burgos has not yet been determined. It is said that former Aviation Minister Lord Londonderry will be dispatched to Burgos, but it remains to be confirmed. (Haitong Telegraph, 25th)

(Paris) ‚Äì Responsible figures recently declared that after the State Council decides to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government on the 27th of this month, right-wing Senator P√©tain (who is in Burgos, negotiating with the Nationalist government authorities) will be appointed as the first ambassador. According to precedent, members of Congress may not be dispatched to other countries for more than six months, but P√©tain may resign in April of this year, before the deadline expires, to participate in the general election. (President Lebrun's term will expire in May of this year) (Havas Telegraph, 24th)

(London) ‚Äì Responsible figures here recently declared that the meaning of the British government's recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government does not mean recognition of its right as a belligerent party. In other words, the Nationalist government, in theory, still cannot blockade the ports under the Republican government's control. At that time, the Nationalist government will only take the place of the Republican government, so the future relationship between the British government and the Nationalist government will be the same as the relationship that Britain previously maintained with the Republican government. On the other hand, Spain's commitments and obligations to other countries under treaties, especially the treaties related to British Gibraltar, the Algeciras Agreement (regarding the Moroccan issue), the current system of the Tangier International Neutral Port, Spain's foreign debt, and the country's commercial relations with various countries, all of these must also be addressed. Diplomatic circles here generally believe that although the Spanish government may change, the treaties that the country signed before the civil war should continue to be valid. If General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, wants to amend any treaty obligations, he must conduct negotiations through normal diplomatic channels. There is reason to believe that the issues that General Franco will raise are nothing more than the new economic system and the resulting situation, which will be similar to the policies implemented by the country's former dictator, General Rivera. As for the rational disposition of foreign funds stored in the country's national bank, those stored in the UK have already been listed, and as soon as the British government recognizes the Nationalist government as the legitimate government, they will be handed over in full. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

### British Government's Policy on Palestine: Maintaining Maritime Traffic to the Far East is of Great Strategic Significance

(London) ‚Äì Regarding the Palestine issue, political figures here recently declared that the government's current policy is based on the defense interests of the British Empire. Britain intends to open a canal in Palestine, starting from the Mediterranean coast, passing through the Jordan River and the Dead Sea, and reaching the port of Aqaba on the Red Sea, so that if a war occurs in the Mediterranean in the future, even if the Suez Canal is destroyed or blocked, Britain can still maintain maritime traffic with the Far East. The port of Aqaba belongs to Transjordan (a British mandate) and is a small fishing port. In addition, the British government also intends to build a railway from the port of Aqaba to the city of Ma'an (also in Transjordan), which will be connected to the railway from the Mosul region (a famous oil-producing area in Iraq) to Medina (in Hejaz), so that even if the Mosul region's oil pipeline (from the Mosul region to the port of Haifa on the Mediterranean coast) is destroyed, oil can still be transported normally. The above two plans have been studied by experts. Although the cost is huge, the British government, in view of the instability of the international situation, has decided to implement them. Once implemented, the proposal to organize a Arab federation in Palestine and Transjordan will have great strategic significance. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

(London) ‚Äì According to reliable sources, the British government will announce its policy on the Palestine issue within the next week, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The current British mandate system will continue to be implemented for at least five years, pending a solution to the issue of European Jewish immigration to areas outside of Palestine. (2) Recognition of the right of the Arab community within Palestine to independence. (3) Restrictions on the sale of all Arab-owned land to the Jewish community, preventing its area from exceeding a certain extent. (4) The entire territory of Palestine is divided into three zones, A, B, and C. Zone A prohibits Jewish immigration, Zone B restricts the number of Jewish immigrants, and Zone C allows Jews to immigrate freely within a specified period. (5) The period before the current mandate system is abolished is regarded as a transitional period, during which representatives elected by both the Arab and Jewish communities can participate in the Palestinian Parliament. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)

### British, Arab, and Jewish Representatives' Joint Meeting Yields No Results, Returns to Separate Talks

(London) ‚Äì According to authoritative sources, after informal exchanges of views between the Arab and Jewish delegations, facilitated by the British government, due to many difficulties and no results, there are no plans to hold such joint talks again for the time being, and separate negotiations will resume from next week. (Haitong Telegraph, 25th)

### Hitler's Speech Praises Achievements, Fearless of Threats from Other Countries, Continues to Strive for the Nation

(Berlin) ‚Äì Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's first public meeting in this city. F√ºhrer Hitler personally delivered a speech, praising the achievements of the National Socialist Party. The last section was about "Foreigners Encouraging Corruption and Fighting," stating that I came from the people. When I started to form this party, I had no fame. After more than ten struggles, I finally conquered the entire empire and seized national power. My life has always been in struggle. Whoever believes that I am afraid of the threatening actions of others is not only ashamed of himself but also unworthy of being the head of the German nation. "In short, we will not waver under the threat of others. If those who encourage war cause war, we will never succumb. The events of 1918 will never be repeated in German history. This is what I can say for sure." (Havas Telegraph, 25th)

Munich ‚Äì F√ºhrer Hitler delivered a speech yesterday at the annual meeting of old party members of the National Socialist Party here, stating that the most important event of last year was the realization of the first article of the National Socialist Party's program announced in Munich in 1920, which is the creation of Greater Germany. Those present at yesterday's meeting included National Socialist Party representatives Hess, Interior Minister Frick, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Police Chief Himmler, and many other key figures of the National Socialist Party.

(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article in "The Observer" titled "Is War Not Far Off?", which stated in brief: "Anyone who pays slight attention to recent foreign newspapers can get the impression that a second world war is about to break out in Europe. However, judging from the speech made by the F√ºhrer Hitler in the Reichstag, although he still put forward colonial demands, fair-minded people would not find fault with this. Now the situation in Spain has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and those familiar with the matter need not be surprised. This is dictated by the reality of the European situation. Now democratic countries are shouting for war and are openly asking their people to prepare for military expansion in order to cope with the attacks of totalitarian countries. According to this, who is provoking the war, Germany or the democratic countries?" (Haitong Telegram, 25th)

(Rome) The semi-official "International Relations" magazine recently criticized Britain and France and involved the United States, but the tone was still moderate. It said that if the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States did not continue the spirit of the Munich Agreement and satisfy the demands made by Germany and Italy, then if a war unfortunately occurred, the three countries would bear the responsibility. "Germany and Italy, starting from a new spirit of movement, have put forward a number of demands. The meaning of this is nothing more than hoping that the strength of the two countries will not be bound by narrow boundaries, but will establish a new balance. This is really a matter of course, and the solution is to satisfy them on the colonial issue. This plan was extremely simple and did not violate humanity. However, Britain and France, with the help of the United States, intensified their military expansion and controlled various raw materials in order to achieve their war-mongering goals and not allow other countries to share their interests. This is enough to cause war. However, the Axis of Germany and Italy will never retreat. If war unfortunately breaks out, Germany and Italy will face it with great perseverance, which will also amaze the enemy countries. For the sake of Britain and France, if they want to avoid great disappointment, it is best to recognize the sacred rights possessed by the Italian and German nations in material and spiritual matters. Otherwise, the all-powerful countries will have to deal with each other with powerful forces. Continuing in this way will inevitably lead to war," he said. (Havas Telegram, 25th)

### Saving One Yuan Can Educate a Refugee for One Semester. German Government Revises Income Tax Regulations to Eliminate the Gap Between Rich and Poor, Implies Encouragement of Childbearing

(Berlin) In order to speed up the completion of its four-year economic plan and achieve national self-sufficiency, the German National Socialist government today increased the people's taxes. It is said that this tax increase is aimed at eliminating the gap between the rich and the poor, so the middle class and those with rich incomes will be more affected. For the middle class, the average annual income tax is US$40, and those with richer incomes will pay even more. At the same time, General G√∂ring ordered German Jews to sell all their gold, silver, and jewelry to government-designated locations. (Associated Press Telegram, 24th)

(Berlin) The government recently promulgated revised income tax regulations effective from the 1939 fiscal year, stipulating that single people and those who have been married for five years without children should pay high income tax rates. The income tax of single people was already higher than that of married people, and now it has been increased by 25%, a difference of 44% compared with the tax paid by married people. However, if a person has been married for five years without children, the tax increase should be 21%, which is still slightly lower than that of a single person. Conversely, the more children a person has, the lower the income tax rate they pay. German authorities have explained this decree, saying that people with children need education and maintenance expenses and cannot bear high tax rates, so they should be shared by single people and those without children in order to provide support and show fairness. It is reported that as a result of this tax increase, Germany's income tax revenue can reach 200,000,000 marks this year and 300,000,000 marks next year. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)

### The Belgian Cabinet Has Been Established for Only Three Days, and a New Political Crisis Is Brewing

Beijing The Belgian Socialist members of the House of Representatives have decided to vote against the new cabinet, and the Liberal Party has also expressed its opposition to the government, because they believe that the new government is adopting austerity policies. Therefore, the new cabinet is in danger of collapsing soon. However, the members of the House of Representatives gathered tonight and decided by a vote of 109 to 47 that they would not take any action on the government's declaration within two days, so the cabinet crisis will not occur within a few days.

### The Operating Period of the US Export-Import Bank Has Been Extended by Two Years. The Bill Will Become Law Upon Signature by the President. Continued Loans to China Are Possible. US Congressmen Expressed Opinions on the Defense of Guam

(Washington) The Senate today passed a bill extending the life of the Export-Import Bank to June 30, 1941. This bill will play an important role in the United States' efforts to exclude commercial interests of combined powers in South America, because the extension of the bank's life may make it possible to increase loans to China. In addition, the Senate has also passed a bill to extend the life of the Product Credit Cooperative to June 30, 1941. It is expected that these two bills have now been sent to the White House for signature by President Roosevelt. (Associated Press Telegram, 24th)

(Washington) According to Republican Congressman Crawford, who opposes the defense of Guam, the United States must first consider its overall policy toward the Far East before defending Guam, especially its policy toward the Philippines and other democratic countries. "Since our national policy is based on isolation, and we will soon withdraw from the Philippines, what is the use of spending another $5 million to defend Guam? Furthermore, after we withdraw from the Philippines, Japan's economic power will inevitably invade the Philippines, and its political power will also enter the Philippines later. What is the use?" Crawford's tone was not absolutely opposed to the defense of Guam, but advocated that the United Kingdom's national policy toward the Far East should be determined first.

### US Secretary of Commerce Explains Economic Policy and Formulates Six Procedures to Encourage Private Investment

US, Des Moines US Secretary of Commerce Hopkins delivered his first policy speech here tonight at the Red Club, advocating the development of six procedures to revitalize US businesses based on the intention of creating an environment to encourage private investment: (1) Not generally increasing central taxes, but revising taxes that may hinder the flow of capital; (2) Breaking down obstacles to private investment in public utilities, railways, and real estate; (3) Labor should be patient and fair when dealing with capital; (4) Increasing national income should seek arrangements for the unemployed and formulate a balanced budget; (5) Providing assistance to small businesses; (6) Farmers should enjoy a larger share of the national income. (Reuters, 24th) Hopkins also said that the US government has shifted its policy focus from "new" to "revival" and intends to use all its strength to promote its success. The government is willing to cooperate with the business community, and the authorities are eager to create an atmosphere that encourages private investment. The government does not intend to adopt a patent policy for public utilities, so as to open the door to investment. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

### Germany Plans to Expand the Anti-Communist Group. Hungary Dissolves the Green Shirt Party Without Affecting German-Hungarian Relations

(Berlin) German F√ºhrer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop exchanged congratulatory telegrams with Hungary and "Manchukuo," which had newly joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. In addition to commenting on this matter, Berlin newspapers also said that Spanish General Franco would also join the pact, and the efforts of Western countries to dissuade Franco from joining the pact had failed. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)

(Berlin) The political circles here attach great importance to the joining of "Manchukuo" and Hungary to the Anti-Comintern Pact. It is generally believed that other countries will continue to join, so as to establish an international anti-communist office and start organizing an international association of the "Anti-League of Nations." Well-informed sources here said that Germany has contacted the Czech Republic and Poland, urging them to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but Poland may not comply. In addition, although Hungary has joined the pact, it has also dissolved the National Socialist Party, and it is not known how it will justify itself. German political circles do not comment on this. (Havas Telegram, 24th)

Budapest Hungarian Foreign Minister Cs√°ky signed the Anti-Comintern Pact today. Afterwards, Cs√°ky said that Hungary's joining the pact was not only the result of its 20 years of struggle against communism, but also a symbol of Hungary's sincere friendship with Germany, Italy, and Japan. Since 1919, Hungary has been engaged in resisting the potential of communism in international affairs. The current Anti-Comintern Pact is not detrimental to any country, but only a method of self-defense to prevent undue interference in the internal affairs of the signatory countries. The Communist Party is international in nature, its methods of activity are diverse, and it is also powerful, so only cooperation between countries can prevent its activities. The German Ambassador to Hungary delivered a speech welcoming Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, believing that this is a sign of Hungary's friendly relations and common interests with Germany, Italy, and Japan. Hungary, in history, has been the mainstay of order and peace. It is gratifying to maintain its historical position faithfully and join the struggle to prevent the destructive work of the Communist Party. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)

(Berlin) According to the German government tonight, the issue of the Hungarian government dissolving the country's National Socialist Party is purely an internal affair of the country. According to Hungarian diplomats in advance, most believed that the dissolution of Hungary's "Green Shirt Team" would not affect German-Hungarian relations. Judging from the German statement, this observation has indeed been proven correct. At the same time, many aspects of Germany also believe that since Hungary has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, the dissolution of the "Green Shirt Team" is in fact of no importance.

The matter was discovered by the princes, nobles and Mongolians of Ejin Horo and the leagues. They expressed their anger at the outrageous actions of the Japanese and De Wang and have taken strict precautions. (Telegram, 25th)

### Tung Oil Exports to the United States, Trade Ups and Downs, War Affects Transportation, Market Prices Fluctuate

Havas News Agency, New York Shipping News Tung oil is a major commodity that has recently emerged in the international market, especially in trade between China and the United States. Recently, the "Commercial Daily" here published an article on the ups and downs of tung oil trade between China and the United States, saying that "Since the outbreak of war between China and Japan, tung oil produced in China has been extremely difficult to import into the United States due to transportation, and oil prices have gradually soared. As a result, the tung oil industry in the states along the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, namely Florida and Louisiana, has tried to step up production. According to the early years of this century, the above-mentioned states began to plant tung trees and test the oil extraction industry. After decades of development, this oil industry has made great progress, but the output is still limited and insufficient to meet domestic demand, so it has given it to China for many years, and it has increased year by year. The peak was in 1937, when China imported a total of 175,000,000 pounds of tung oil into the United States, while the United States produced the most in last year (1938), but it was only 4,000,000 pounds, and the difference between supply and demand is very far. According to this observation, it can be known that in the next few years, the tung oil market in the United States will still need to purchase a large amount from China. There is no doubt that in terms of the situation of Americans planting tung trees, in the early stage, they did not know what was suitable for soil texture, tung tree species, and climate dryness and wetness, so the losses were very large. Until last year, the planted tung trees began to flourish. At present, the oil price is gradually falling, which is completely dependent on the situation in China. In the past two years, due to the war, the rise and fall has been even greater. In November 1937, after the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, the source of tung oil was cut off for a time, and the market price soared to 22 cents per pound. Later, due to the large number of tung oil exports from Hong Kong, the oil price fell. Until Guangzhou fell in October last year, it rose back to 15 cents. Since then, the oil price has hovered between 12 cents and 15 cents. The United States currently has sufficient inventory. Whether the market price can be stabilized in the future depends on whether China's exports can be transported smoothly through the Yunnan-Burma Highway and whether the export volume can be adjusted appropriately. Otherwise, the rise and fall cannot be predicted. However, since tung oil freight has increased and delivery has not been on schedule, most of the original users of tung oil have switched to other types of oil. Even in terms of paint, the amount of tung oil used has been greatly reduced." (Havas Telegram, 25th)

### Preliminary Negotiations on Anglo-German Economic Cooperation Completed, Watkin Returns Home to Report

(Berlin) British Foreign Office Economic Secretary Watkin arrived in Germany a week ago and successively visited Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Economic Minister Funk, and General G√∂ring. He has reported to the British government, especially Commercial Secretary Stanley, on the impressions gained from this trip regarding the preparations for the Anglo-German commercial negotiations to be held on March 15. According to Berlin authorities, Watkin's visit was purely for notification purposes, so no written agreement was reached. As for the content of the discussion, most of it concerned the possibility of promoting Anglo-German economic mutual benefit relations and avoiding competition between Britain and Germany in the world market. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)

(London) The Times recently published a telegram from its Berlin correspondent saying that British Foreign Office Economic Secretary Watkin had held talks with the German government authorities after arriving in Berlin. In addition to economic issues, government issues such as armaments and colonial issues were also involved. "The British government is willing to cooperate with Germany economically and hopes to reach an agreement politically. The information Watkin has obtained will definitely be helpful."

### Japan Declares Decision on Shanghai Concession Incident in Tokyo

It is not yet clear what steps will be taken

A Shanghai Zilin Daily reporter in Tokyo reported on February 22 that after the Japanese Minister of the Army, Minister of the Navy, and Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke in the Diet yesterday, reporters met with spokespersons from both the Army and Navy provinces today. Judging from the spokespersons' remarks, Japan clearly intends to take a tough stance regarding the actions of Chinese assassins in the Shanghai Public Concession. It seems that the Japanese side will either demand that complete control of the foreign police affairs of Shanghai be transferred to them, or demand that the Japanese Navy or the headquarters of the military police maintain order throughout the Public Concession, or tighten control over all Chinese entering and leaving the two concessions. It has not yet been decided. The three provinces of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs are currently holding meetings to consider the proposals made by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. It is expected that a decision will be made soon. According to Colonel Mizuno, acting spokesperson for the Navy Province, to reporters, the Shanghai Public Concession's Municipal Council and its police department either lack sincerity or are incapable of preventing such murders. Japan is extremely indignant about this. They have not even captured one of the criminals who commit such cowardly acts even in broad daylight. It is almost unbelievable that with police officers stationed everywhere, they cannot easily capture these criminals. Furthermore, the outrage continues to occur despite repeated requests from the Japanese side to the Municipal Council to take adequate precautions to prevent such crimes. If the Municipal Council and its police department are both incapable, then others must take control of the situation. It cannot be allowed to continue as it is today, and strong steps must be taken. When the reporter asked if the strong action meant that the Japanese marines would take over the remaining part of the Public Concession, i.e., the south bank of the Suzhou River, the spokesperson replied that while he could not answer definitively, it was possible. He added that most of these crimes do indeed occur in the Public Concession, but the assassins may be hiding in the French Concession. This point is not yet certain, but it is certain that even in the past, the French Concession was a hotbed of conspirators, assassins, and political offenders. They come from all parts of China and hide there. According to Major Akiyama, acting spokesperson for the Army Province, to reporters this afternoon, after a series of assassinations of prominent Chinese, it seems that an impossible situation exists in the Shanghai Public Concession that cannot be allowed to continue. As for what steps will be taken to make a decision, it is impossible for them to say today, but representatives from the Army Province are currently discussing with representatives from the Navy and Foreign Affairs provinces, and it is hoped that a direction for action will be decided in the near future, perhaps in a day or two. Regarding the accidental bombing by Japanese army aircraft of British territory within the Kowloon leased territory boundary near Shenzhen at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, Major Akiyama said that the Army Province has already instructed the Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong to apologize to the Hong Kong authorities for this mistake. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, it was able to use the Pearl River for transportation, so the area no longer had special uses and has been abandoned. However, Chinese guerrillas began to use it to connect with British territory and gather in the area, so the Japanese army decided that this was to bomb them and make them leave. During the bombing, a shell accidentally fell on British territory and hit a locomotive, injuring some people. He predicted that these damages would be compensated within a reasonable period of time. An spokesperson at the British Embassy also told reporters today that Britain attaches great importance to this matter. Embassy Counselor Dodd has already lodged a formal protest with Foreign Minister Arita yesterday and has not yet received a reply. An acting spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the killings of Chinese in the Shanghai Public Concession this morning, stating emphatically that 17 assassinations have occurred in succession, and although we have made requests, the police department has not yet captured a single person. All evidence shows that the Japanese side's repeated protests have been ineffective. It can be seen that although the police department may be trying to apprehend the murderers, they are completely incapable. Therefore, the Japanese government is now considering what appropriate measures must be taken to deal with this situation.

### Japan's Theory of Invading the South and West Is Not Credible

Bai Chongxi Talks in Kunming

Special Correspondence from Yunnan General Bai Jiansheng is a famous general of the Guangxi Province. He is highly knowledgeable in military affairs and has been very active in the current war of resistance, making great contributions. On February 3, he flew to Yunnan by special plane from Chongqing at 11:00 a.m., accompanied by his chief staff officer Wang Zemin and staff secretary adjutant, etc. After hearing the news, the reporter immediately went to visit him and received his consent to publish his remarks as follows. This decision was made in Chongqing after participating in the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. It was at the time when the War of Resistance entered the second phase, and the front-line war situation was in a transitional period, which was slightly calmer than before. Therefore, he took time to visit Chairman Long and also because he was responsible for the military training minister, he would also inspect the education of troops and military schools and national military training. He was also commissioned by Chairman Chiang to inspect the Air Force Officer School. The result of the Fifth Plenary Session was extremely satisfactory, and everyone spoke freely in the meeting, giving full play to the democratic spirit of the Three Principles of the People. Mr. Wu Zhihui once said that the success of this meeting was unprecedented in our party, which fully demonstrates that sincere unity has indeed been achieved. As for the war situation in the southwest, the recent surface seems to be serious, but from a military point of view, in today's situation where the Japanese are beset with crises and strong from the outside but weak from the inside, if they want to open a battlefield in the southwest, it is actually not allowed by the facts. Moreover, our preparation is extremely strong, so how can they not know? The rumors that Japan wants to invade the south or the west are all words of propaganda and intimidation. We only need to have firm faith to deal with it.

### Qingpu County Chief Inspects Various Townships

Lu Yongfang and Others Beheaded

Qingpu Correspondence Since taking office, Mr. Li, the magistrate of Qingpu County, has spared no effort in promoting the administration of various districts. Before the Lunar New Year, winter defense was important, and it was said that he needed to understand the actual situation of the administration of various districts in order to conduct an examination. Therefore, last week, he led important officials such as Mr. Hong to inspect various places. The inspection of various districts in the eastern township was thorough, and the people enthusiastically welcomed him wherever he went. County Chief Ping cared about the people's livelihood and inquired in great detail. When he arrived at a certain district, he heard that the eastern township had been disturbed by local ruffians Lu Yongfang, Zhang Youguang, and Lu Asan. He immediately ordered District Self-Defense Battalion Commander Guo to lead the team to suppress them. He arrested Lu Yongfang, Lu Asan, Zhang Youguang, etc., and interrogated them overnight. They confessed to the facts. In addition to pursuing the remaining accomplices, they were immediately executed and their bodies were beheaded and displayed to the public.

### Gu Zhutong Inspects the Eastern Theater

Jiaxing Correspondence Gu Zhutong, commander of the √óth war zone, recently arrived in √ó√ó from √ó√ó army and held an important military meeting to decide on the allocation of funds and the counter-offensive plan. It was also resolved to promote lower-level autonomy in the various guerrilla areas in order to achieve the goal of cooperation between the military and civilians, to control food exports, and to ban the import of Japanese goods in order to prevent leakage and benefit the war of resistance. Gu was also deeply concerned that the various teams under his command might not be able to implement it effectively, so he went to various lines to inspect and inquired about the daily situation of his subordinates from the local people in order to prepare for rectification. It is said that the results of this trip were very good, so the morale was higher than before, and more patriotic people abandoned their businesses to join the army. Moreover, the women of Jiaxing have already formed a women's team and started training, and their strength will be very great when they serve on the battlefield in the future. However, recently, there have been bandits impersonating guerrilla teams in Jiaxing, who often extort the people, which is very hateful. Gu therefore ordered the troops under his command to pacify the bandits as soon as possible, and those who can be pacified will be pacified. Those who are willing to be accomplices of the enemy will be exterminated in order to relieve the people's suffering.

### Treacherous Merchant's Rice Transport Seized

Intercepted by Guerrillas

Qingpu Correspondence: Around 2 PM on the 15th, three trucks, fully loaded with rice, were traveling from Qingpu towards Shanghai on the Qinghu Highway. Near Dujia Lane in Qingpu County, two of the trucks were intercepted by the guerrillas of the √ó Unit stationed there. Mr. Zhuang, who was escorting the trucks, was taken to the unit for interrogation. However, he spoke evasively and no clear information was obtained. According to local rice merchants, Mr. Zhuang's father was captured and executed by the guerrillas last year for secretly transporting rice to aid the Japanese. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhuang did not learn from his father's death and continued his wrongdoing, transporting even more rice than before. It is said that the person arrested this time might be the same individual.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Levies Public Welfare Fee on Ships

Export Temporarily Postponed

Ningbo Correspondence: Shipping merchants Zhou Dalie, Chu Hede, Zhu Meixian, and others previously complained that the Zhejiang Provincial Government's levy of public welfare fees on ships was excessively high and unbearable. They jointly telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that the fees be levied based on the net tonnage of the cargo. It is now learned that the provincial government decided at a meeting on the 14th that the public welfare fee for imports will still be two yuan per ton of the ship's net tonnage, while the levy on exports will be temporarily suspended. The order has been telegraphed to Commissioner Zhang stationed in Ningbo for compliance.

### Wu Jizi Shrine Burned Down, Confucius's Handwriting Turned to Ashes

Jiangyin Correspondence: Shengang Town, located eighteen li west of the city, has the tomb of Wu Jiza from the Spring and Autumn Period. The shrine's origin can be traced back to the Jiayou era of the Song Dynasty when the exiled prefect Zhu Yan, based on historical records of Wu Jizi's tomb being west of Shengang, visited the site and built the tomb. The Jizi tomb in Danyang only contains his clothing and cap, while the tomb in Shengang definitely contains his remains. After the tomb was completed, the Jizi Shrine was built. From the Song Dynasty to the present, it has been repaired multiple times. The shrine had a main hall, east and west side halls, guest rooms, the Plum Blossom Academy, and a three-bay main gate. In the center was a ten-character inscription personally written by Confucius in seal script: "Alas, here lies the tomb of the gentleman Yanling of Wu." A wooden pavilion was built to protect it. Zheng Deng, an imperial censor of the Ming Dynasty, wrote a couplet: "The stars and the moon are cold at night by the gentleman's tomb," "Wind and thunder protect the sage's writing." Previously, in the Gengshen year of the Tongzhi reign, Peng Yulin visited the shrine and personally painted four plum blossoms, which were engraved on the walls. Many people made rubbings of them. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, Wu Peng, the magistrate of Jiangyin County, gathered craftsmen and materials to extensively repair the shrine, giving it a new look. Since the full length of the Zhencheng Road was opened to traffic in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Wu Zhihui, a prominent figure in the Kuomintang, personally visited the Jizi Shrine to study ancient history and compile the genealogy of the Wu clan and also photographed the shrine. The photos were included in the genealogy. The Jizi Shrine was indeed one of the ancient sites of Jiangyin. During the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, troops were stationed in the shrine multiple times. When Jiangyin City was occupied by the Japanese army, the shrine was the first to be ravaged. A few days ago, a fire suddenly broke out, destroying everything. Most heartbreakingly, the ten-character inscription by Confucius and the plum blossom stone engravings by Peng Gangzhi were reduced to ashes. Only a mound of yellow earth remains of the Jizi tomb.

### International Settlement's Defense Strict, Public Morale Greatly Stabilized

Iron Wire Nets Deployed in Lanes of Nanjing Road, Patrols and British Troops Deploying in Sections

Stock Exchange Market Prices Remain Steady for Days

The Public Settlement Police Department, considering Nanjing Road the most prosperous commercial area in the whole district, is increasing defense since yesterday to prevent disturbances by undesirable elements. At each dock along the Bund and the Huangpu River, two British soldiers and Chinese police officers are stationed, and all persons entering and exiting ships are being searched. Nanjing Road, from the Bund to Yu Qiaqing Road, has all its north and south lanes leading to pedestrian walkways blocked off. Craftsmen are setting up iron wire nets, and even Hongmiao Lane, usually quite busy, has been blocked. One or two Chinese police officers are stationed at each lane entrance. Nanjing Road is a mile long and only the north-south longitudinal Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Shandong Road, Shanxi Road, Fujian Road, Zhejiang Road, Yinghua Street, Guangxi Road, Guizhou Road, Yunnan Road, Lloyd Road, etc. remain open for normal traffic. Other lanes that have been blocked include Zhili Road (commonly known as Hongmiao Lane), Cifeng East Lane, Cifeng West Lane, Wufu Lane, Xiangfen Lane, Ciyong Lane, Longquanyuan Lane, Rixin Lane, Deyu Lane, Daqing Lane, Yuxing Lane, Jixian Lane, and Lane 361. Those with existing iron gate installations are closed all day and have not been fitted with wire nets. Nangao Yangli and Dexinfang are not blocked, and neither are their non-through lanes. The Buddha Street below the Cishu Building, as well as Bao'anfang and Guanqunfang and two streets, have wooden barricades already in place and thus have not been blocked. Residents of all blocked lanes must enter and exit through the back of the lanes. The precautions are quite strict. Other lanes connecting two roads, or those that are small and remote, or those that can access all four sides, have been fitted with wooden posts wrapped in iron wire nets, allowing only one-way traffic.

Shanghai Consulates in Close Contact

Regarding the Japanese side's protests to the Public Settlement twice, using "terrorist incidents" as a pretext to expand Japanese power within the Shanghai Municipal Council, sources state that the Municipal Council is carefully studying the matter in meetings and is in close contact with the consuls of the major powers in the Public Settlement, such as Britain and the United States. Each consul has sought instructions from their respective governments. The Japanese demands to the Municipal Council, using "terrorist incidents" as a pretext, are roughly a continuation of the demands made on January 4th of last year, but the scope is slightly larger and they desire immediate implementation. The Municipal Council will respond to the Japanese side shortly, maintaining its existing policies and striving to maintain order within the Settlement.

State of Unease Eliminated

The North China Daily News reports that on Thursday (the 23rd) evening, the Public Settlement police cooperated with over three hundred members of the White Russian Merchant Corps to conduct a large-scale search in the central district, unseen for months. The rooftop garden of the Sincere Company and the East Asia Hotel were inspected, and three people were arrested and taken to the police station. Unable to find any crime they had committed, they were released yesterday (the 24th) at noon. When the three were arrested, papers containing Chairman Chiang's speech given in Chongqing on December 16th of last year were seized, but no other incriminating documents were found, nor were others arrested. During the search, each member of the police force searched the people, and every room in the hotel was thoroughly examined. The White Russian Merchant Corps blocked pedestrians from approaching the building during the search, while countless curious pedestrians on the opposite side of Nanjing Road stopped to watch. At the same time, authorities are diligently working on defense. The Bund has temporarily had no patrols for months, or at least the patrols had been reduced to a minimum. Now, patrols in groups of two or three have been increased. Patrols of the West Yorkshire Regiment of the British Army, equipped with light machine guns, patrol Nanjing Road almost every afternoon. Armored trucks of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, carrying the White Russian Merchant Corps, continue to patrol various parts of the Public Settlement. Patrols are particularly close in the western district, with mobile patrol teams continuing to patrol Great Western Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, and Robison Road, especially at night, because most recent shootings have occurred in those areas, which border the area controlled by the "Reformed Government" and are the hiding places for increasingly rampant criminals, even those who snipe at patrol officers. In short, the increasing unease of this port for the past few days now seems greatly stabilized, because the Shanghai Stock Exchange market prices, which many regard as an accurate barometer, have remained steady. Some prices have even risen a few pounds sterling in the past day or two. Regular patrols are seen around the areas defended by American and Italian forces. For the past few days, two U.S. Marines have been stationed at the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, equipped with a military telephone. French Concession police have also been active recently, with search teams busily inspecting vehicles and pedestrians and confiscating weapons day and night at various points in the French Concession.

### Political Assassinations Seem Temporarily Suspended

Speculation by a Senior Police Officer

Continued Assassinations Would Greatly Affect the Public

The Continental Daily News reports that a senior police officer told reporters yesterday (the 24th) that there would be no political assassinations in this port for the time being. He made this statement based on his belief in the intelligence and wisdom of the Chinese people, because if political assassinations continued, the Chinese people who currently enjoy protection and residence rights in the Public Settlement would suffer greatly. No police force in the world can prevent political assassinations, especially in a city where residents sympathize with the assassins. While the Japanese may genuinely feel that the Public Settlement Police Department cannot be held accountable, Japanese public opinion may force them to take reckless and drastic measures, and they may also realize that such measures are meaningless and would be detrimental to themselves. If the Japanese take such steps, all residents of the city will suffer greatly, especially the Chinese. If the perpetrators study the habits of the victims, and the victims are unaware of the precautions and still appear before the perpetrators, then such assassinations cannot be prevented, because three people have been killed each day at the same time while riding in rickshaws on the same road. Investigating after the assassination is futile. In ordinary assassinations, it is possible to investigate the motives of the crime with suspects, and the police department's speculation is accurate six or seven times out of ten, but in political assassinations, the scope of suspects is vast, because anyone among the countless Chinese in Shanghai may have the motivation to encourage such acts. The police officer's statement is based on reliable information from the guerrilla areas downstream of the Yangtze River, which states that political assassinations are bound to occur in that area. Assassins are very active in Wuxi, where an average of five assassinations occur every day. The Japanese army frequently closes the city gates and searches house to house, but the assassins are active again the next day. It is rumored that several political assassinations have occurred in the Public Settlement north of the Suzhou Creek, but this has not been confirmed.

### Four Passengers Arrested on the Feikang Still Not Released by the Japanese

Japanese Side Falsely Claims They Are Guerrillas

German Consulate Will Continue Serious Negotiations

The German ship Feikang of the Rulun Trading Company in this city was suddenly detained by a Japanese warship at 7 AM the day before yesterday, outside the Wusongkou Dinghai Island sea area, while sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou. It was searched for three hours, and four Chinese passengers were arrested. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to inquiries made by reporters from the Modern News Agency with the company yesterday, the company immediately reported the incident to the German Consulate General in Shanghai after it occurred, requesting serious negotiations and demanding the release of the arrested passengers. The German Consulate immediately lodged an oral protest with Japanese Consul Miura after receiving the report, but the four passengers had not been released as of yesterday. The German Consulate must wait until the German shipowner, Mr. Kebei, submits a detailed report of the incident to the consulate before it can lodge a formal protest. A Japanese spokesperson claimed that the four arrested Chinese were guerrillas, but the German side absolutely denied this, which is obviously a false accusation by the Japanese.

### Establishment of the Subei International Relief Committee and Branch Committees in Various Counties

Flood Situation Remains Severe, Expectations for Spring Relief and Work Relief Are High

The Subei International Relief Committee, in order to facilitate the handling of Subei flood relief work, has established branch committees in counties with churches or Western residents, appointing Chinese and Western personnel. In early this month, Yuan Xiaogu, deputy director of the general affairs group of the committee, and inspectors Zhi Ligeng and Bai visited various counties in Subei to promote this work and negotiate the establishment of branch committees. The Shanghai office of the committee has received a letter from Yuan and Feng from Huai'an, stating: "Branch committees in Taixian and Xinghua have been decided to be established. The number of disaster victims identified by the branch committees and the amount of relief funds requested are indeed extremely accurate. During our trip to the north, we saw that although the water has receded slightly, the embankments are still deeply submerged in the water. Ships sail over them, appearing to be on the sea, and it is impossible to distinguish the riverbank. The sowing of the two wheats has already been missed, and many houses are still submerged. In addition to winter relief, expectations for spring relief and work relief are even higher. We hope to continue to raise funds to alleviate the suffering." (Omitted below)

### Japanese Interference in Foreign Ships Transporting Grain Resolved After Negotiations

Japanese Side Voluntarily Withdraws the Permit Issuance Method

But Still Uses Special Power to Deliberately Obstruct

After Japanese Consul Miura in Shanghai, citing the fake order of the "New Reformed Government," notified the consulates of various countries and interfered with foreign ships loading and transporting grain, the consulates paid great attention to this case. All believed that the Japanese action clearly infringed upon the rights and interests of foreign merchants, so they prepared to lodge a serious protest. At the same time, after direct negotiations between various foreign shipping companies and the Japanese troops stationed along the river, a temporary solution has been reached. The details of the process are recorded as follows:

Direct Negotiations by Various Shipping Companies

After the Japanese side used the pretext to prohibit the loading and transportation of grain, various foreign shipping companies, in addition to reporting the details to their respective consulates to protest, also directly negotiated with the Japanese troops stationed along the river at Changyinsha, Hupu, and other places, led by Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, Chinese-Italian Trading Company, and German Reiss & Co., as well as Norwegian and Portuguese companies. As a result, the Japanese method of "all ships of third countries loading and transporting grain must be approved by the 'New Reformed Government' and issued a permit before being allowed to load, transport, and sail" has been voluntarily withdrawn. However, before the grain is loaded for export, it must be guaranteed that the grain to be loaded can only be transported to Shanghai and is not allowed to be transferred to other ports. It is now learned that the authorities of the various shipping companies have submitted the details of the resolution to their respective consulates for review and handling.

Imposing Harsh Regulations on Procuring Grain

The Japanese side's attempt to control river transport and squeeze out foreign merchants' business, after the foreign shipping companies reasoned with them, has outwardly allowed foreign ships to freely load and transport goods, but in reality, it has implemented various means to invisibly hit foreign shipping. The method is to use the fake organization to require the owner or freight customer to report to the local Japanese puppet "agency" in advance to obtain "removal permits" and "import permits" for various goods entering and exiting, in order to use this fake evidence as a tool to create various difficulties and cause foreign shipping companies to suffer losses and voluntarily suspend their business. On the one hand, it is also forcing merchants to load Japanese ships. According to people from the mainland, the various transshipment companies along the river have been meeting for days to discuss jointly protesting to the Japanese puppets.

Various Grain Merchants Temporarily Suspend Loading

Because the Japanese puppets have implemented various goods import and export permits, various grain merchants are unwilling to transport the grain that has been purchased in previous years to the river to load ships for Shanghai, in order to avoid accidental losses. Therefore, although the Shanghai grain market has opened since the 24th of this month, the daily transactions of grain are all from the warehouse, and the domestic rice has not yet opened.

### A Group of Foreigners from Guling Arrives in Shanghai Today

Including a Honeymoon Couple

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that a Japanese transport ship carrying thirty-seven foreigners from Guling is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (the 25th) or early tomorrow morning (the 26th). The ship left Jiujiang on Thursday morning and reportedly left Nanjing yesterday. If it sails normally, it is expected to arrive today. The foreigners on board include thirteen British, eight Americans, five Swedes, three Belgians, one German, one Latvian, and one Soviet, including a honeymoon couple who were married in Guling on Sunday.

### Congratulations Telegraphed by Various Circles in Shanghai to Pan Gongzhan

After Pan Gongzhan was appointed Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, members of the education community in this city telegraphed their congratulations the day before yesterday. Various national goods organizations in this city believe that Pan has made many contributions to social undertakings over the years. He is now appointed Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and he will certainly be able to serve the country with pleasure. Yesterday, they jointly sent a letter to Huang Yanpei and Hu Xiyuan in Chongqing, asking them to represent all national goods organizations in Shanghai in expressing their congratulations to Pan.

The Shanghai Factory Federation yesterday telegraphed former Social Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, congratulating him on his appointment as Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. The message read: "Respectful greetings to Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee in Chongqing. We were overjoyed to hear of your appointment as Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. At a time when final victory is approaching, we rely on the sincerity of the people to unite and overcome difficulties. Your achievements in Shanghai have always been admired by all circles. We specially send this telegram to offer our congratulations and hope that you will greatly display your talents and publicize national policies, so as to align international opinion and guide the enthusiasm of the people."

### German Ships Again Carry Jewish Refugees

Approximately Eighty People

The North China Daily News reports that eighty-five Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 24th) aboard the German ship Xianghuosituo. The total number of Jewish refugees now living in this city will reach 3,500. According to sources in this port, another seven or eight hundred are expected to arrive before the end of March.

### Guerrillas Control the Shanghai-Taicang Line

Japanese Soldiers Are Alarmed Several Times a Night, Once Withdrawing from Luodian

According to a person who came to Shanghai from Luodian Town on the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus route yesterday, in addition to the guerrillas already scattered along the Jinghu Railway and the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, the guerrillas' tracks have recently expanded to the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus route. Because the Japanese soldiers are few in number and tired of dealing with the guerrillas, they once left the town (referring to Luodian Town) for five or six days. Now, the area along the route is under the control of the guerrillas.

### Residents of Eastern Shanghai Hear Loud Gunfire Again

Two Trucks of Japanese Soldiers Covered in Mud Are Seen Again

It Is Likely That the Guerrilla Unit in Wusong Has Inflicted Heavy Damage Again

The Continental Daily News reports that the residents of Yangshupu and Hongkew were awakened by loud rifle fire yesterday morning (the 24th). The gunfire started around 3 AM and lasted for two hours. It seemed to be coming from between Shanghai and Wusong. According to residents of the area, the gunfire stopped around 5 AM. Observers in the area saw two trucks of Japanese soldiers covered in mud passing through the streets around 7 AM, heading towards the barracks. Although there is no official news about this, it is likely that the guerrillas are active. Residents of Yangshupu and Hongkew further stated that the gunfire was loud and only occasionally interrupted.

### Japanese Warships Patrol Outside the Jiaojiang Estuary, Strict Precautions Still in Place in Eastern Zhejiang

Japanese Planes Bomb and Reconnoiter Zhejiang

Salt Stored in Haimen Has Been Transported to the Rear

Since the Japanese warships' attempt to land in Haimen, Zhejiang failed, they have blockaded Jiaojiang, hindering the passage of foreign ships. Japanese warships still patrol outside Haimen, and Japanese planes fly over various parts of Eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance and bombing. The situation in Eastern Zhejiang remains tense, and the precautions taken by the Chinese army are even stricter. The details are recorded as follows:

Japanese Warships Patrol the Blockaded Jiaojiang

The Japanese warships have blockaded Jiaojiang outside Haimen, and have built a blockade by sinking gravel sailboats, marked with bamboo poles. Although the bamboo pole signals have been destroyed by our army, it will be difficult to achieve the passage of Jiaojiang in the short term. The German ship Feikang, when passing through Jiaojiang on its way from Wenzhou to Shanghai the other day, saw two Japanese warships patrolling in the distance. As for the waters of Dinghai, Yueqing, and Putuo, Japanese warships are occasionally found patrolling, so the situation in Eastern Zhejiang remains serious.

Japanese Planes Reconnoiter and Bomb Zhejiang

Japanese planes occasionally fly over various parts of Eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance and bombing. On the morning of the 22nd, five Japanese planes flew into Zhaobaoshan in Zhenhai and dropped three bombs, destroying one house. They also dropped a bomb on Dinghai Island, but there was no loss. Yesterday, six Japanese planes flew over Zhuji, Jinhua, and Ningbo in Eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance. Since February 18, Japanese planes have occasionally flown over various parts of Eastern Zhejiang. Most of the bombs they dropped have landed in barren areas, so there has been no major loss in Eastern Zhejiang. The air raid alarm equipment in Eastern Zhejiang is becoming increasingly complete.

Salt Stored in Haimen Transported to the Rear

The reporter of the New Sound News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Japanese warships' attempt to land in Haimen was reportedly based on a report from a Chinese traitor, stating that there was salt waiting to be loaded and transported to the coastal defense. Since the landing failed, they blockaded Jiaojiang to prevent the salt from being loaded and exported. However, our side had already transported the salt from Haimen to a certain place in the rear. Currently, there is no salt in Haimen, and Haimen is not a salt-producing area. As for the precautions in Haimen, they remain strict to prevent Japanese warships from landing again.

Strict Precautions in Coastal Areas of Eastern Zhejiang

The coastal areas of Eastern Zhejiang, such as Ningbo and Haimen, as well as Jiaojiang, Yongjiang, and Oujiang, had already been ordered by Commander-in-Chief Liu of the Tenth Army Group to be prepared by the two garrison commanders of Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo, who deployed defense projects and stationed heavy troops. In order to maintain the export of local goods, Ningbo and Wenzhou ports are temporarily allowed to open for traffic. Since the Haimen incident, in order to prevent Chinese traitors from mixing into the mainland, foreign ships must first anchor in the heart of the river before being allowed to dock after being strictly inspected by the military police.

### Brazilian Minister Laigue Came to Shanghai with His Family

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the Brazilian Minister to China, Laigue, arrived in Shanghai with his family yesterday (the 24th) from Peiping. It is expected that he will stay here for some time.

### Promoting the Cloth Clothing Movement

And Designating This Year as Cloth Clothing Year, Meeting to Discuss Promotion Methods Within Days

The Cloth Clothing Association, organized by the business, industrial, and academic circles of this city, aims to promote the wearing of cloth clothing and practice thrift. Its purpose is pure, and its intention is profound. Since its launch, people throughout Shanghai have responded enthusiastically. The association has received a mountain of membership application letters in recent days. Because the association does not charge any fees, applicants only need to swear to wear cloth clothing and fill out an application form. However, due to the limitations of the association's constitution, it has not been able to accommodate everyone, which is deeply regrettable. It is now learned that the association has decided to expand its current organization in response to requests from various parties. In the future, there will be no limit on the number of applicants. The association has also decided to actively promote the cloth clothing movement from now on and designate this year as cloth clothing year. In addition to sending letters to all public and private schools, shops, and factories in the city for unanimous assistance, it is also heard that leaders from all circles will be invited to gather within days to discuss promotion methods.

### The Western District as a Den of Iniquity: Rampant Terrorist Cases

Assassination Incidents Are an Inevitable Consequence

Armed Fights Over Land Have No Political Nature

Mainland newspapers report that terrorist incidents are rampant in the Western District, with several pseudo-police, spies, and other thugs killed. However, contrary to what the Japanese side claims, these cases have no political nature. Yesterday (the 24th), according to sources in the local police, these assassinations are an inevitable result of the development along the roads outside the Western District concession. The Western District is a "crime zone," as recently evidenced by the frequent

Thug Fights

In the first half of this month, sixteen new opium dens were opened in the area outside the concession roads. They all applied for registration to the Japanese advisor of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and the person in charge of the uncompleted opium monopoly. As far as is known, they have not yet been approved. Therefore, these opium dens cannot obtain "black goods" from other sources and have to resort to

Private Opium Smugglers. Regarding this matter, a certain Chinese director of the Opium Den Association (whose name is best kept undisclosed here) made a deal with the Japanese advisor of the pseudo-"Shanghai Municipal Government" in mid-January. Both parties agreed that the Association (located at No. 19 Route des Soeurs, Astor House) would purchase at least 100,000 yuan worth of opium per month for three months, and the Japanese advisor would then supply the opium. The director of the Association agreed to distribute the opium to various opium dens. However, he was not satisfied with obtaining this

Monopoly in the Western District and refused to sell opium to opium dens that were not members of the Association. Only thirteen of the eighteen opium dens in the Western District are members of the Association, so the remaining five had no goods to sell and had to buy privately smuggled opium. However, the director did not allow smugglers to intrude on his territory and hired ten people from the Opium Den Association to form a spy group to curb "private" opium sales. As they pursued more fiercely, the smugglers' smuggling methods became more cunning. First, they competed in intelligence, then they resorted to violence. After the spy group of the Association armed themselves, one of the smugglers

Also armed themselves. Therefore, there have been constant concerns about armed fights between the two sides in the past, and it is still the case today. Both sides have their own customers who buy opium, so they are very jealous of each other. According to well-informed sources, even the killings of several pseudo-police officers have no political nature. They now increasingly feel that most of these so-called "political assassinations" should be attributed to the opium trade.

### The Wanli Steamer Released by Japan

Will Start Sailing on the Shanghai Port Line

The Portuguese steamer Wanli, formerly represented by the Anping Company, with a gross tonnage of 759 tons and a net tonnage of 423 tons, built in 1891, has been moored at the Japanese naval wharf in Hongkou since being detained by the Japanese Navy. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry that after the Portuguese consulate negotiated with the Japanese side, the ship has been released and sold to other merchants. It is now represented by the Hengfeng Shipping Company. As soon as the repairs are completed, it will start sailing on the line between Shanghai ports.

### The Port of Beisha is Blockaded: Ships Cease Docking

Only the Beisha Route Still Operates

Foreign shipping companies operating on the Beisha route received a telegram yesterday morning from the Italian steamer De Yao, stating that the port of Xinhai has been blockaded by Chinese guerrillas, prohibiting ships from docking. Although the Beisha route of each company is still operating as usual, docking at the port of Xinhai is temporarily suspended. The Beisha route operates between Haimen, Qidong, and Sanhe Port.

### The Sanmin Corps Headquarters Begins Training Members

Since the Central Corps Headquarters of the Sanmin Zhongyi Youth Corps sent investigator and commander Xue to Shanghai, he has established a headquarters in the suburbs of Shanghai and reported it to Commander Gu of the Third War Area for reference. Now, Xue believes that the significance of the anti-Japanese war and the original tasks they bear in the future have not been thoroughly understood by the people in the guerrilla areas and the self-defense groups of various counties. Therefore, there have been cases of defection and joining the enemy, and it is urgent to provide them with military and political common sense training to enhance the strength of the anti-Japanese war. He has now recruited young intellectuals and tasked the training group of the corps to conduct training as soon as possible in accordance with the promulgated outline, so as to distribute them to various troops and mass groups for universal training, and to help launch a full-scale war of resistance. It is said that most of the staff of the headquarters are graduates of the Central Military Academy who are hard-working and have been welcomed by the people. The headquarters has a member registration group. Regardless of military, police, party, government, and youth, anyone with patriotic enthusiasm, regardless of gender, can request to join the corps with the introduction of two or more members. According to the organizational regulations of the corps, the Central Corps Headquarters is followed by the branch corps, with the province as the unit, and then the district corps, with the city as the unit. The two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already had personnel sent by the central government to prepare for the establishment of branch corps respectively, and there is no other organization to disrupt the system. It is also planned to organize a directly affiliated district corps in Shanghai in accordance with the charter. Xue has also submitted a special report based on his investigation results, requesting that personnel be sent to assist in the process.

### The French Mailboat Company Mansion Completed

Officially Opened on the 27th

The new mansion of the French Mailboat Company on the Bund of the French Concession in Shanghai has been fully completed and is scheduled to officially open at 11:45 am next Monday (the 27th). This new building is located next to the French Consulate General on the original site of the company. All the equipment is very modern and can be regarded as one of the best on the Bund of the French Concession. In addition to the company's own use, the south half of the lower floor is rented by the Sino-French Bank. The entire second floor is for the company's own use, and the other floors can be rented as offices. There are two elevators for going up and down.

### Gravel Industry Holds Emergency Meeting

Some Workers Have Resumed Work: Hope That Wantai Will Stop Monopolizing

The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after the gravel industry association opposed Wantai's monopolistic operations and declared a strike, the striking workers have now resumed transporting sand from Sijiao to Shanghai. In order to discuss how to deal with the Wantai incident, the gravel industry association decided to hold a temporary emergency meeting at the association's office at 2 pm today. At that time, the following will be discussed: (1) Wantai Gravel Company's monopolization of sand transportation affects the city's construction and the livelihoods of more than 10,000 sand transportation workers. It is hoped that the company will stop monopolizing and cooperate to avoid harming each other's rights; (2) Although Wang Pinrong, the captain of the guerrilla team stationed in Sijiao, has approved the original sand transportation method, the sand transportation workers of each gang have not fully resumed work. It is planned that relevant members will send personnel to persuade them on the spot within a few days. As for the case of Wantai Gravel Company accusing Fang Jinxiang and others of obstructing business, the Shanghai First Special District Court announced the judgment after three hearings yesterday. Based on three days of business calculation, the total loss reached 511.5 yuan, which was compensated by the defendants Fang Jinxiang and others. It is said that the defendants expressed dissatisfaction and filed an appeal.

### Chen Lu's Funeral: Heavily Protected

Several Japanese People Attended the Funeral: Pseudo-Police Stationed at the Alley Entrance of Bingshe

Mainland newspapers report that Chen Lu, the "Foreign Minister" of the pseudo-Nanjing regime, was buried yesterday (the 24th) afternoon. His procession departed from Xujiahui, crossed the boundary of the French Concession, passed through various roads, and reached a street outside the Great West Road. The patrolmen of the two concessions provided strict protection. There were two motorcycles with patrol teams riding in front and behind the hearse. They passed through Avenue Joffre and entered Route Paul Beau, traveling quite fast. Along Route Paul Beau to Route Haig, plainclothes and uniformed

French Concession patrolmen were stationed every certain distance. The Public Concession Police Department's security was even tighter on Route Haig. A red police car carrying a team of armed patrolmen and two motorcycles with patrol teams were stationed at a certain Bingshe house next to the Great West Road, and patrolmen were stationed on the roadside. When the four cars of the funeral procession and the hearse arrived at the Public Concession, the red police car escorted them into the vicinity of the alley entrance leading to Bingshe.

A large crowd of onlookers was blocked by a large number of patrolmen. One armed pseudo-police officer was stationed on each side of the alley entrance, and other pseudo-police officers were stationed along the road. According to what was seen, there were several Japanese people in a car with tightly closed curtains. It was said that the other three cars contained the deceased's close relatives. It was learned that after Chen was killed yesterday, pseudo-police officers were stationed at his residence at No. 668 Yuyuan Road, and they repeatedly dispersed the crowd gathered near the house.

### Yang Hainan Retires: A Grand Banquet Held by Dongya

### Overseas Chinese in the United States Launch Movement to Stop Transporting Iron to Aid the Enemy

Propaganda Against Transporting Steel to Japan: Foreigners Show Sympathy, Achieving Significant Results

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese people all over the world were generously donating money to their motherland. Overseas Chinese in the United States donated a large amount of money. The local overseas Chinese also launched a "movement to stop transporting iron to aid the enemy." According to Mr. Wang, an overseas Chinese businessman who recently returned to Shanghai from San Francisco, the overseas Chinese in San Francisco, in addition to actively raising donations and donating to the national crisis, launched a "movement to stop transporting iron to aid the enemy" at the beginning of last month. The purpose of this movement is to persuade overseas Chinese and Americans not to transport steel and other metals from the United States to Japan, so as not to increase the raw materials for Japanese military equipment and increase their power to invade China. Since its promotion, many knowledgeable overseas Chinese have joined in droves, automatically propagating to their friends or foreigners, and have won the sympathy of enlightened Americans, achieving significant results. Recently, the amount of steel and other metals transported by ships leaving the United States for Japan has been greatly reduced, even to the point of none. At the same time, overseas Chinese in other ports have also responded one after another, voluntarily propagating to all parties not to transport metal materials to Japan. This move by overseas Chinese is of great benefit to the motherland's war of resistance.

### Colluding in Theft and Abandoning the Elderly: Defendant Claims Property Has Been Divided

Old Woman Also Files Civil Suit Requesting Return of Leather Suitcase

Case Requires Detailed Investigation, Summoning Witnesses for Further Trial

Zhang Bingxin, a deceased wealthy Shanghai jeweler, held a high position in the jewelry industry association of the old schoolyard. He came from a poor family in his early years. When his father died, Bingxin was only eight years old. He relied on his mother, Zhang Ou (now 75 years old, residing at No. 31 Continental Square, Rue de la Tailles), to raise him with hard work. After he started doing business, his family gradually became wealthy. He originally lived in Shipinong, Ximen, which was self-owned real estate. Bingxin married a wife but had no children.

He adopted a son named Haoqiu, who is 23 years old this year and has been married. Bingxin then took two concubines, Qin (45 years old this year) and Dai (30 years old this year), both from Suzhou. Qin also had no children, only Dai gave birth to a daughter named Haoju, who is seven years old this year. Bingxin's wife died three years ago, but the wives and concubines lived separately, each establishing their own household. When the August 13th incident occurred two years ago, Bingxin welcomed his old mother, son, daughter-in-law, and two concubines to

Seek refuge and moved to No. 234 Route D'elias. Unexpectedly, Bingxin fell ill and died in the Red Cross Hospital in November of that year. The valuable jewels, jade, antiques, and real estate he left behind were worth nearly one million yuan. Bingxin's friends Tu Zhengge (the turncoat lawyer who served as the president of the pseudo-Shanghai District Court, Tu Fuxian, has been killed) and Huang Ruisheng (currently residing at No. 74 Rue Massenet), together with relatives, inventoried the items and sealed them in a leather suitcase.

Tu issued a seal and handed it to Zhang's mother, the old lady Ou. In March of the 27th year, Bingxin's two concubines, Qin and Dai, and his son Haoqiu, took out the suitcase while Ou was out and deposited it at Huang Ruisheng's house, never to return. In May, Haoqiu welcomed Ou to live at No. 31 Continental Square. Then Haoqiu and his wife moved out again, leaving Ou alone and neglecting her. Zhang Ou recently entrusted lawyers Ge Zhitan and Sun Deji to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Special Court,

Accusing her son's concubines Qin, Dai, grandson Haoqiu, and Huang Ruisheng of colluding in theft of entrusted stolen goods and abandoning the elderly. She requested that they be investigated and prosecuted according to law and filed a civil suit to recover the stolen leather suitcase, requesting urgent disposition and that the suitcase be seized to prevent loss. After receiving the complaint, the court once held a hearing, but because the defendants did not arrive, the date was changed. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao Qingbang

Held a continued hearing. The defendants Zhang Qin, Zhang Dai, and Zhang Haoqiu arrived in court with their defense lawyers. The fourth defendant, Huang Ruisheng, was represented by lawyer Song Yunhui due to illness. First, the plaintiff's attorney stated the intention of the prosecution. Zhang Tu then testified that after her husband's death, Kong Shunlin helped her copy the property into five shares and opened the bank safety deposit box. Since her residence was insecure, she deposited the leather suitcase at Huang's house.

Now I have divided one-tenth of it with Dai and my mother-in-law, and the remaining seven-tenths are evenly divided between Haoqiu and Haoju. Zhang Haoqiu testified that when the family was divided on December 31 of the previous year, he notified his grandmother, but she did not attend. He put her share in the Salt Industry Bank safety deposit box and sealed it by a lawyer. At this point, the plaintiff's attorney presented the newspaper advertisement posted by Zhang Haoqiu, which stated that the inheritance must be analyzed with the consent of the grandmother, and the letters. The court believed that the case needed to be thoroughly investigated and witnesses were necessary. Therefore, the court ordered a change of date for another hearing and adjourned the court.

### Planting False Evidence: Seven Years of Imprisonment

He then reported it to the sentry Chinese police. After the police investigated, they found the drugs and brought them back to the police station together. However, after a detailed investigation by the Chinese detective Han Shoushan, he learned all the secrets. Therefore, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for the crime of planting false evidence and possessing drugs. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide yesterday morning, Wang Haihai was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights for the crime of planting false evidence against others and intending to sell drugs.

### Involved in the Yitaihing 40,000 Yuan Robbery Case: Fierce Bandit Finally Caught

Escaped While Resisting Arrest at the Old Dongfang Hotel: Four More Robbers Arrested Based on Informants

Yang Chengcai, a Chinese detective of the Laozha Police Station, based on the report of informants, said that there were robber gangs hiding in Room 223 of the Old Dongfang Hotel at No. 245 Zhejiang Road. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month at 4:15, he secretly went with the Western detective Smimus, the Chinese detectives Cao Qishan and Huang Cifu, etc., and arrested the robber Li Jianming (aka Amao). While interrogating, Li took the opportunity to suddenly take out a pistol from his pocket

And shot at the detectives, causing Yang Detective's arm and Cao Huang's hands to be injured by bullets. Li then escaped in this chaos. After the police station sent a large number of detectives to arrive, the murderer had already fled far away. Afterwards, the police station, seeing that Li dared to resist arrest and escape, was bold and reckless, ordered all police stations to

Strictly pursue and arrest him. On the evening of the 23rd of this month at 10:30, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Xinzha Police Station learned that Li Jianming was hiding in the house at No. 219 Yunfu Road, and immediately went to arrest Li again and brought him to the police station. Two bank deposit books, two checkbooks, one pawn ticket, and 732 yuan of legal currency were found on his body. He was ordered to be detained and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court on the morning of the 24th. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case,

Applied for detention, and the court ordered approval. However, the detectives handling the case continued to investigate without sparing any effort. On the afternoon of the 24th, the accomplices Chen Baosheng and Li Dazhang from Jiangbei, who were exchanging gold jewelry, were arrested at the Qiu Tianbao Jewelry Store at No. 592 Nanjing Road. Then, based on the confession, Huang Xingyang and Sang Rongxiang from Shaoxing were arrested at No. 492 Avenue Edward VII and No. 11 Lane 876 Penglu, respectively. They were brought to the Xinzha Police Station for detention.

Chen and the other four were sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case and requested a change of date for the trial to be combined with Li Jianming's case. After Fu Lin's judge verified the confession and briefly interrogated each defendant, he ordered them to be detained and tried together with Li's case. However, it is reported that each defendant who was arrested is related to the giant robbery case of more than 40,000 yuan from Yitaihing.

### Gambling Arrest

Twenty-One Men and Women Arrested: Taken to the Police Station for Detention and Interrogation

The Chinese and French detectives of the gambling squad of the French Concession General Patrol Room were ordered to strictly prohibit the drawing of heads and gambling gatherings, so they were specially divided into groups to conduct strict searches in the big hotels. On the previous (24th) night, it was detected that a large number of gamblers were gathering and gambling on Pai Gow Yaotan in Room 14 on the fourth floor of the No. 2 Baxian Inn in Donggaodi Lane, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII on Dongzilai Fire Street. After 11 o'clock, they secretly went to arrest them. When each gambler was at the height of excitement, they arrested 15 male gamblers and 6 female gamblers on the spot and brought them to the police station along with the gambling tools for detention and interrogation.

### Betrothed Woman Sues for Compensation After Fianc√© Suddenly Marries Another

Requesting contract fulfillment and compensation of 50,000 yuan, with compulsory enforcement of the contract, scheduled for pronouncement

Zheng Zuoyi, 22 years old this year, the son of Zheng Mengyuan, a Chaozhou native and owner of the Kou Cheng pawnshop in the Taihe Lane of the Marshall Road, became acquainted with Zhang Xiuying, a Wuxi woman (20 years old this year), residing at No. 42, Lane 4, Route Lorton, in 1935. They cohabited at No. 76, Jing'an Villa, and their love deepened. They agreed to marry, and on August 18, 1938, both parties went to Lawyer Chen Yong's office to sign a contract, scheduling the official wedding for September 22 of the same year. If the man
reneged on the agreement, he would have to compensate the woman with 50,000 yuan for living expenses. However, when the date arrived, Zheng Zuoyi actually went against the agreement and became engaged to a woman with a different surname. Zhang Xiuying sent a letter of reproach, but a satisfactory resolution could not be reached. Recently, Zhang Xiuying hired Lawyer Ma Zhenzong as her agent and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Civil Division against Zheng Zuoyi for breach of contract. Judge Wu Xiaoke of the court held a hearing on the 11th of this month. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The defendant commissioned Lawyer Sun Zuji to respond to the defense and filed a counterclaim, requesting
the cancellation of the contract. Court discussions were adjourned to a later date for further examination of witnesses. Details of these events have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held. Both parties were again represented by their lawyers. Lawyer Chen Yong, as a witness, testified that on August 18, 1938, the defendant Zheng Zuoyi, accompanied by Cao Wufeng, came to his office and asked him to witness and draw up a contract, scheduling the wedding with the plaintiff Zhang Xiuying for September 22. In case of reneging on the agreement,
compensation of 50,000 yuan would be paid for losses. After he drafted the contract, they went to the woman's home to formally sign it. He asked the defendant why it was necessary to go through this procedure and why such a large sum was to be paid as compensation. The defendant replied that he loved her dearly and feared that the woman might change her mind, so a contract was necessary, and money was no problem. Cao Wufeng testified that he had known the defendant for nearly two years. Before the contract was signed, Zheng came to his house twice and said that he wanted to marry the plaintiff and that a contract had to be signed. On August 18, Zheng sent a car to pick him up and they went to the lawyer's office together. After drafting the document, they went to the woman's home to formally sign it. When asked whether the woman showed any

coercive behavior during the signing, he answered no. After hearing the testimonies, the court considered the case clear and ordered closing arguments. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendant loved the plaintiff and signed the marriage contract without coercion. As for the defendant's claim that he suffered from meningitis, which caused mental confusion, the defendant had studied at Fudan and Chi Chih Universities and is now working at Ning Shao Insurance Company, indicating that he has considerable experience and education. There is no reason to believe he would handle matters carelessly. The court should order him to pay compensation according to the contract and enforce it compulsorily, and bear the litigation costs, and reject the counterclaim. Following the defendant's lawyer's response, the court announced the end of the proceedings and scheduled the pronouncement for March 2.

### Country Woman Takes Her Life Due to Gambling Addiction

A local woman, Xu Ma Shi, has a penchant for gambling. Recently, she became addicted to playing "flower society" games, incurring significant losses. A few days ago, she pawned all of her husband's clothes for over ten yuan and took it to a "listening tube" parlor in Caojiadu for one last desperate gamble. Unfortunately, heaven did not favor her, and she still lost. Filled with resentment and despair, she decided to end her life. She secretly entered the kitchen of a flower society parlor, intending to hang herself. Just as she was putting the noose around her neck, she was discovered by someone. They immediately took measures to rescue her. After learning her address, they escorted her home.

### Hairdresser Beaten to Death for Disturbing Peaceful Sleep Late at Night

The perpetrator sentenced to five years

Several hairdressers in a barber shop at No. 665 Hankou Road suddenly started singing loudly at midnight on the 4th of the month, when all was quiet. They sang in various dialects, laughing and making noise. The neighbor behind them was the Cuihua Printing Shop at No. 28 Cide Lane, Zhejiang Road. The workers at the printing shop, having worked hard all day, needed to rest at this time. They found it difficult to fall asleep due to the noise. So they went to question the hairdressers, saying that they should not be making such a ruckus and disturbing people's peaceful sleep late at night. Unexpectedly, the hairdressers became angry and a conflict broke out. Initially, there was a verbal argument, which then escalated into a physical fight. During the fight, a hairdresser named Lin Fusheng, also known as Lin Shiji, was injured with an iron bar. After being taken to the hospital, he unexpectedly died from his injuries on the evening of the 6th. The Zhabei police station learned of the incident. Detective Wang Shusen went to the scene and arrested ten people who participated in the fight, including hairdressers and printing workers Mei Chunhua and Mao Xiaocai. They were sent to the First Special Court. Zashi Ru Baoyi of the police station filed charges according to the law. The interrogation has been completed. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division announced the verdict. Mao Xiaocai was sentenced to five years in prison for causing serious injury resulting in death. Mei Chunhua, Lu Ziquan, Yang Sanduo, Wang Delin, Zhu Shengzhang, Guo Laidou, Xu Jinrong, Liu Shengquan, and Zhu Xianhong were all found not guilty.

### Hotel Guest Verbally Abused After Dispute

Witnessed by a Westerner who signed as a witness, the case was brought to the Central Police Station for investigation

Xu Wengui, a 28-year-old Suzhou native and guest at the fourth-floor dormitory of the Sichuan Road YMCA, residing in Room 53, has been living there for nearly half a year, paying nine yuan per month in rent. Recently, the association increased the rent by ten percent, which dissatisfied the guests. Xu's words were perhaps somewhat extreme. The staff of the association took his suitcase, bedding, and other belongings without permission and stored them in the second-floor office before 11 PM the previous evening, before Xu returned to the dormitory. Around midnight, Xu returned from outside and learned of the incident from other guests. Another verbal dispute ensued, and Xu was punched in the chest and arms. The police station sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to mediate, and the matter was temporarily resolved. Unexpectedly, Xu returned to the association around 7:30 PM last night. As soon as he reached the second floor, he was blocked from going upstairs by four refugees and several tea attendants who were lying in wait. Words failed, and he was beaten by several people, tearing his suit, tie, and other items. A Westerner witnessed the situation when the attack occurred and, motivated by righteous indignation, immediately signed his name and gave it to Xu Wengui, willing to be a witness. Someone called the police, and everyone was taken to the Central Police Station for investigation.

### Husband Dies Suddenly of Enteritis, Wife Falsely Accused of Murder

The truth comes to light after an autopsy

Chu Jiagui, a 31-year-old native of Rugao, made a living pulling a rickshaw in Shanghai. He and his wife, Bai (25 years old), rented a room at No. 24 Zhicheng Lane, Keller Road, in the French Concession. Chu suddenly felt abdominal pain and discomfort on the 18th of this month, which was Lunar New Year's Eve. He consulted a doctor and took medicine, but the treatment was ineffective. He died at 4 PM on the 19th. His wife and his brother, Jiafa (36 years old, residing at No. 17 Tongchang Lane, Haining Road), prepared a coffin and funeral arrangements. The coffin was sent to a boat on Suzhou Creek at Pinlang Road in West Shanghai, waiting to be transported back to their hometown for burial. Unexpectedly, on the 24th, Chu Jiafa suddenly reported to the French police that his sister-in-law, Bai, was not at peace and that Chu Jiagui's death was unclear, with a suspicion of murder. The police chief, after receiving the report, sent detectives to investigate. They brought Chu Bai, the wife, in for questioning. At the same time, detectives, together with the Public Concession police, hoisted the coffin to the autopsy site at Tongren Hospital. Yesterday, they reported to Judge Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who arrived at the site with a forensic doctor to open the coffin for examination. The body was already severely decomposed. The exterior showed no signs of injury or illness. An autopsy was performed, and the results proved that the deceased, Chu Jiagui, had indeed died of enteritis and there was no other cause. The official instructed that the body be returned to the brother and wife for re-coffining. However, before the examination, the brother and wife accused each other. The brother accused the wife of misconduct and adultery, murdering her husband. The wife accused the brother of attempting to harass her after her husband's death and falsely accusing her of murdering her husband out of spite. After the examination, the truth became clear, and the brother was speechless and silently withdrew.

### Gambling and Opium Smoking are Rampant in the Western Shanghai Towns

Fights frequently erupt due to gambling disputes

Since the fall of the western Shanghai towns of Longhua, Caohejing, and other villages, opium and gambling have been openly rampant everywhere. Since the Lunar New Year's Day, the teahouses and gambling dens have become even more prosperous. Gambling addicts neglect sleep and meals, indulging in it. Currently, in the towns of Zhujiahang, Changqiao, and Meilong, under the management of the Japanese army, people shout and gamble day and night. As a result, verbal disputes and fights occur from time to time. Yesterday morning, in the teahouse opened by Mao Xiaodi, a native of Chongming in Longhua Town, two gamblers argued over gambling money and physically fought. Although bystanders mediated at the time, they temporarily dispersed. Unexpectedly, in the evening, the two sides clashed again. A disagreement led to a big fight. Several gamblers, including Qian Jinmao (a local resident who sells fresh produce), were seriously injured. The teahouse's benches and teapots were smashed to pieces, causing considerable damage.

### Tan Huang Actress Wang Caiying Sues to Dissolve Engagement

Fianc√© requests rejection, pronouncement scheduled for March 2

Wang Caiying, also known as Wang Miaojin, a 29-year-old Anhui native who used to perform Tan Huang at the Tianyun Lou of Wing On Company, currently residing at No. 13 Yixing Lane, Qipu Road, recently hired Lawyer Mu Qi as her agent and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Civil Division against her fianc√© Wu Xianglin (31-year-old Ningbo native, residing above the Kangfa Western-style Clothing Store at Nos. 81-83 Avenue Joffre), to
dissolve the engagement. The reasons for the lawsuit are roughly as follows: The defendant met the plaintiff in the summer of 1936. He claimed to be an inspector at the Jianghai Customs, boasting of abundant profits and a wealthy family. He had recently lost his wife and was looking for a woman to remarry. He regarded the plaintiff as a celestial being, pursuing her relentlessly and seeking marriage. The plaintiff, being a woman with limited knowledge, was confused and agreed to the engagement. Before two months had passed, the defendant changed his demeanor, claiming that the customs job was too arduous and he wanted to switch to the shipping business.
He demanded that the plaintiff provide a guarantee of 500 yuan. When she refused, he scolded her for being heartless and insulted her at will. Subsequently, taking advantage of the plaintiff's lack of preparedness, he secretly took the plaintiff's diamond ring. After the plaintiff and her brothers negotiated with him, his brother took responsibility for returning it. Later, while the plaintiff was going to Hangzhou to burn incense, he falsely claimed to entrust her with the repair of a wireless radio. He tricked the maid into giving him a six-tube radio worth 200 yuan. The defendant is so idle and unwilling to work that it is difficult to marry and live with him. She has no choice but to sue, requesting
permission to terminate the contract, etc. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court, on the 28th of last month, had Judge Wu Xiaoke try the case in Civil Division 7. The plaintiff mistakenly went to the Fourth Tribunal to wait for trial, resulting in the defendant being the only one present for questioning when this case was being tried in the Seventh Tribunal. The court concluded the single-party argument as the plaintiff was not present and scheduled the pronouncement. When the plaintiff learned that she had mistakenly gone to the Fourth Tribunal, she rushed to the Seventh Tribunal, but the court had already adjourned. Therefore, the plaintiff petitioned the court, stating the error and requesting that the debate be reopened. Details of these events have been reported in this newspaper. This case has been approved by the court,
and the debate was reopened yesterday morning. Judge Wu still tried the case in Civil Division 7. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer and the plaintiff stated the reasons for the lawsuit, saying that the defendant's various actions were inappropriate and that they could not get along together, requesting permission to dissolve the contract. The defendant's side argued that Lawyer Lu Qi had witnessed the engagement and that he had repeatedly requested to marry, but the plaintiff had refused. When they became engaged, the plaintiff had investigated and found that the defendant had considerable wealth. There is no substantial reason to request cancellation.
He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff's side also presented documents as evidence, saying that after obtaining a love letter from another woman in the defendant's pocket earlier, the defendant had sworn not to associate with other women, but the defendant claimed that this happened before the engagement and the written document could not be used as evidence, etc. The court reviewed the situation, announced the conclusion, and scheduled the pronouncement for March 2.

### After the War, Chinese Shipyards Were All Occupied by the Japanese

All Eleven Shipyards were Occupied and Reopened with Hired Workers

Shanghai's shipbuilding industry was quite developed before the war. According to investigations, there were ten large and small Chinese state-run shipyards along the banks of the Huangpu River: the Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi, and the privately-run Laogongmao in Bailianjing, Sanbei in Rihuigang, Dachunghua in Dinghaiqiao, Hongchang and Hexing in Nanshi, and Caili, Longchang, Hengchangxiang, Hongxiangxing, and Merchants' Inland River in Lujiazui. There were three British-owned shipyards: Ruirong in Yangshupu, Hefeng in Gaomiao, and Xiangsheng in Lujiazui (now merged into United British). There was one French-owned shipyard: Qiuxin in Nanshi. Japanese merchants had no foothold in this industry, so Japanese merchant ships had to be entrusted to Chinese and foreign shipyards for repairs. After the war, with the exception of the foreign shipyards, all eleven Chinese state-owned and privately-run shipyards were occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation obtained government assistance and seized the Jiangnan Shipyard, renaming it Mitsubishi Shipyard and hiring workers to reopen it, hoping to expand its influence in the shipbuilding industry. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Nissin Company, also with the approval of the Japanese authorities, forcibly moved all the machinery and assets of five Chinese shipyards in Lujiazui, Pudong ‚Äì Caili, Longchang, Hengchangxiang, Hongxiangxing, and Merchants' Inland River ‚Äì to the vacant land of Taitong Warehouse in the eastern district, and established the so-called Nissin Shipyard. It has already employed five or six hundred ignorant workers, led by foreman Zhang Linhua, to specialize in repairing Japanese merchant ships, while other foreign merchant ships are ignored. In addition, the Laogongmao Shipyard in Pudong was occupied by the Japanese Navy, and the Dachunghua Shipyard in Dinghaiqiao was occupied by the Japanese Army. All Chinese-owned shipyards have been plundered by the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese ambition to control Shanghai's shipbuilding industry is becoming increasingly active.

### Quislings Grieve for Each Other After a "Hare Dies, a Fox Laments"

The puppet "Vice Minister" Lian Yu concurrently serves as "Foreign Minister." Xiandai News reports that after the puppet "Local Court President" Tu Fu, the puppet "Foreign Minister" Chen Lu of the Reformed Government, and the puppet "Minister of Transportation" Li Guojie, and others were assassinated in Shanghai one after another, all the villains were terrified and discussed "methods of comforting the dead," a truly pitiable situation. It is now known that the puppet organization, in addition to discussing "compensation" methods, will give the deceased puppet officials a relatively "solemn" memorial service and has scheduled a memorial service for Tu Fu on March 1 at the puppet Local Court on Penglai Road in Nanshi. A live drama will be performed to express the meaning of "a hare dies, a fox laments." It is also known that after the puppet "Foreign Minister" Chen Lu was killed, it has now been decided that the puppet "Vice Minister" Lian Yu will concurrently serve.

### Pudong Commercial Bank Debt Registration

Creditors' Meeting Scheduled for April 8

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in handling the reconciliation case filed by the Shanghai Minhang Pudong Commercial Bank, has scheduled a deadline for debt registration and the convening of a creditors' meeting, and has issued a special announcement stating that: According to a letter from the Shanghai Minhang Pudong Commercial Bank, "Our bank is now unable to balance receipts and payments due to the impact of the war. We hereby apply for reconciliation in accordance with Article 41 of the Bankruptcy Law, and have attached the reconciliation plan and register, etc., to the meeting." The application was deemed legally compliant and the bank was informed that it would be accepted for processing, and the Executive Committee of this Chamber, Pei Yunqing, and accountant Wang Haifan, were appointed to handle it together. It is now scheduled that the period from now until April 7th (Gregorian calendar) will be the period for registering debts. All creditors of the bank are requested to bring their debt certificates within the aforementioned period and go to Wang Haifan's accounting firm at No. 2 Avenue Edouard VII (at the intersection of Rue Kin-Lienweg), French Concession, to register in accordance with the law. A creditors' meeting will be held on April 8th (Saturday) at 2 PM at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club (i.e., the 5th floor of the Bankers' Association) to discuss the reconciliation plan. Please pay attention and act accordingly. This announcement is hereby issued.

### Qichang Wharf Not Yet Open, Pudong Ferry Business is Sluggish

In order to control the Pudong River's short-distance transportation, the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company has recently opened a new cross-river line from the Bund of Beijing Road to the Qichang Stack in Pudong, dispatching a ferry to transport passengers. However, because the Qichang Stack wharf in Pudong has not yet been opened, and those without Japanese passes cannot enter or exit, the number of passengers is very small. The company has approached the Japanese army in Pudong, allowing civilians to exchange their counterfeit "citizen's certificates" with a photo attached for Qichang Stack entry and exit permits. However, the public ignores this initiative to forcibly attract customers to prevent danger, so no one goes to get a permit.

### Rampant Banditry in Nanshi

Armed Robbery and Carrying Away Loot, Demonstrating the General State of Local Security

Xue Taisheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 75 behind Tianwangtang, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, used to set up a preserved goods stall in the local vegetable market, selling salted fish. His business was not bad on weekdays, and he had some savings, which attracted the attention of local bandits. Around 11:00 PM on the previous (24th) night, more than a dozen bandits suddenly broke into his house, armed with torches, single-edged swords, and iron bars, and rushed to the upper floor. At that time, Xue and his wife were already asleep. The bandits dragged them out of bed, forced them to hand over cash, and when they refused, they brutally beat Xue with iron bars, covering him with injuries. Xue, unable to bear the pain, called his wife for help. The bandits then tied Xue's wife with ropes and burned her breasts with candle flames. Xue's wife, in excruciating pain, finally agreed to hand over 42 yuan in cash, 3.7 yuan in fractional currency, and more than 2 yuan in copper coins to the bandits. But the bandits were still unsatisfied. They took more than ten cotton robes, cotton pants, single-layer clothes, four cotton quilts, a basket of salted hairtail, and more than five dou of white rice, packed them all in sacks, robbed them separately, and fled.

### Finance Frenzied Pursuit‚Ä¶It's All About Gold's Inherent Value! All Quarters Vigorously Pursue Cash Markets Peak Price Reached 2,145 Yuan Reportedly, Hong Kong Market Also at 2,190 Yuan Is It True That Everything Besides Gold Is Worthless?

Yesterday, the cash gold market was volatile and the situation was chaotic. The extreme scarcity of gold led to a surge in gold prices, soaring to unprecedented heights due to a severe shortage of available gold. Trading was exceptionally active, reaching 1,180 taels citywide. Initially, securities firms, led by firms from northern China, aggressively pushed prices up, opening at 2,110 yuan. Hearing that Hong Kong gold prices were around 2,190 yuan, Hong Kong firms continued to commission cash brokers and certain money exchange houses to accumulate gold, believing that the profit margin from transporting gold to Hong Kong remained substantial. Reportedly, certain Chinese banks and foreign banks were also buying in, while certain parties were secretly active in relentless accumulation. This further fueled public anxiety, leaving sellers helpless, and intensifying the price surge. The price then soared past the major milestones of 2,120 and 2,140 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the price hit a record high of 2,145 yuan. However, as Shanghai and Hong Kong gold prices converged, leaving little profit margin after accounting for transportation costs, approximately 200 taels were released by brokers on commission, and wealthy local merchants also reduced their positions. Buyers, seeing the high prices, stopped accumulating, causing the market to weaken and prices to fall back down by 10 yuan. Nevertheless, the closing price still rose sharply by 26.5 yuan. The day's trading was extremely frenzied, with jewelry gold changing hands as many as five times, setting a new record for price volatility since jewelry gold trading began. English pure gold and customs gold declined slightly. (Editor's note: Gold market fluctuations usually follow foreign exchange rates. However, the recent surge in gold prices, while the foreign exchange market has been stable, is an unusual occurrence.)

Gold Soars by Twenty-Six and a Half Yuan Since the morning opening, the initial bid price from buyers was 2,108 yuan per strip (ten taels). However, sellers demanded 2,115 yuan before agreeing to sell. The stalemate continued until 10:15 AM, when a northern firm entered the market with 50 taels at the opening price of 2,115 yuan, which was 6.5 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. After the opening, sellers were scarce, leading to further market chaos and continued upward price movement. A money exchange house bought 50 taels for 2,118 yuan, and a cash brokerage bought another 50 taels for 2,118 yuan, both sold by a certain money exchange house on behalf of local firms. Later, a jewelry store, acting on behalf of Hong Kong firms, bought 50 taels from its peers for 2,120 yuan. Subsequently, the same cash brokerage bought another 50 taels from jewelry stores at the same price. At that time, a northern firm bought another 50 taels at 2,122 yuan, and a jewelry store bought 50 taels at 2,121 yuan, all supplied by a certain gold firm. After accumulating, the northern firm abruptly sold 50 taels back to jewelry firms at 2,121 yuan. A cash brokerage then bought 50 taels from jewelry firms at the same price. Following that, another cash brokerage bought 50 taels from money exchange houses at 2,122 yuan. Afterwards, sellers became even scarcer, and a certain money exchange house aggressively accumulated gold on behalf of foreign banks, further fueling the price surge. A cash brokerage bought 50 taels from jewelry firms at 2,144 yuan for the noon closing price. In the afternoon opening, the buying interest from jewelry firms remained strong, causing further price increases. Jewelry firms bought 50 taels from money exchange houses at 2,145 yuan, the highest price of the day. Subsequently, gold firms continued to sell, leading to a downward correction. A gold firm sold 50 taels to jewelry firms for 2,141 yuan. Subsequently, cash brokerages and others stepped in, pushing the price down from 2,141 yuan to 2,135 yuan. Finally, a jewelry firm sold 30 taels to a money exchange house at 2,135 yuan for the evening closing price, which was 26.5 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price (marking five consecutive days of gains, totaling 79 yuan). Throughout the day, there was a price range of 30 yuan. The selling price of branded gold from cash brokerages reached 2,145 yuan, with a buying price of 2,130 yuan. The current margin is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with no trading activity.

Jewelry Gold Jumps Four Times in a Row The selling price of jewelry gold from jewelry stores was initially unchanged. However, at 10:25 AM, it was raised by one yuan per tael. After half an hour, it was raised again by one yuan. Then, at 11:40 AM, it was raised again by one yuan. New businesses listed the price at 215 yuan, all reaching unprecedented peaks. Later, at 4:05 PM, due to a slight pullback in raw gold prices, the price was also lowered by one yuan. The old Qingyun firm revised its price to 216 yuan, while the new businesses revised their prices to 214 yuan, with a buying price of 200 yuan.

Pound Sterling Strengthens, Pure Gold Falls On the 24th, a London cable stated that English pure gold fell due to the strengthening of the pound sterling, decreasing by half a pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 3 and a half pence. This caused the China cash buying and selling price of the Central Bank to also decrease to 1,210 yuan and 0.6 jiao. The listed customs gold price fell by 2 li, amounting to 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also decreased by 3 jiao, amounting to 1,205 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Stable as Always! HSBC Maintains Position on Tianjin and Peking Front Money Exchange Houses Dump Forward US Dollar

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw favorable conditions, with increased buying activity by foreign banks on behalf of Tianjin and Peking, as well as various major trading houses and Chinese speculators. However, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to offer ample supply, and money exchange houses also dumped forward US dollars, resulting in little change throughout the process. Trading was relatively active in the first half of the day. The Hong Kong market remained stable due to balanced supply and demand. However, according to a certain person in the industry, the buying frenzy may tighten the market slightly next week.

Initially, the recent short-term London Cable contract continued to shrink by 0.0625, while the long-term contract remained flat. New York silver prices also remained stagnant. The London spot gold price shrank by half a pence. The exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars increased by 1 centime and 3 mils, while the rates against French francs and Shanghai dollars remained unchanged. The US dollar rate against British pounds increased by 0.1875, while the rates against French francs and Shanghai dollars remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained stagnant as before. The banks' opening selling prices were 8 pence and 0.125 for British pounds and 15 yuan and 875 for US dollars, with no change from the previous closing prices. After the opening, the market was quite sluggish. When HSBC's listed prices were released, they remained unchanged. The white silver equalization tax was also announced to be reduced by 0.25, with a tax rate of 7.75%. At that time, foreign firms again, on behalf of Tianjin and Peking foreign merchant banks, as well as trading houses and Chinese speculators, scrambled to buy British and US dollars. However, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to supply the market steadily, so the situation remained unchanged. Trading houses and Chinese firms bought British pounds from HSBC for 8 pence and 0.125. Subsequently, trading houses bought US dollars from a certain bank for 15 yuan and 875. Near noon, a money exchange house suddenly sold (March) US dollars to a foreign bank for 15 yuan and 75. After this, trading houses again bought Hong Kong dollars from a foreign Chinese-Italian exchange house for 54 yuan and 375, so the process remained quite stable. The banks' noon closing selling prices were 8 pence and 0.125 for British pounds and 15 yuan and 875 for US dollars, the same as the morning opening prices. As a result, there was still no change in the British and US dollar rates from the previous closing prices, and the Hong Kong dollar rate also remained unchanged. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday.

### Long-Term Cable Nears Contraction, US Silver Remains Stagnant

A London cable on the 24th stated that speculators were selling while India was buying, resulting in a flat market. After the closing, the market remained flat. A small number of Indian firms bought at the listed prices. The short-term cable contract shrunk by 0.0625, while the long-term contract remained flat. A New York silver cable stated that US silver prices remained stagnant. A Bombay silver cable stated that the Indian silver market had turned flat, with the spot price shrinking by one anna, while the near and far-term prices remained unchanged.

### Driven by Gold Craze, British Gold Pound Soars by Nine Jiao

Yesterday, English pure gold fell by half a pence, and the exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars increased by 0.1875. Foreign exchange trading houses still had strong demand, and banks provided a steady supply, due to occasional sales from Hong Kong. The market price was stable throughout the day, with little change. Raw gold opened high, with Hong Kong firms actively accumulating it, followed by gold firms and jewelry stores. The availability of gold was originally very scarce, and once it was sought, the market price skyrocketed. Wealthy firms in Tianjin and Hong Kong relentlessly pursued it, with the soaring price seemingly endless. Although there was a slight decline at the closing, it ultimately did not stem the tide, leaving it uncertain where it would end. Foreign currencies were affected by the gold market, with the British gold pound surging by approximately one yuan. Wealthy individuals were insatiably greedy, with few sales and strong buying interest, making supply difficult and trading scarce. Trading in US dollar bills was very active, with the price increasing by one point only. The majority of other currencies remained unchanged due to stable exchange rates. There was no trading in the Association market. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British gold pound rose by nine jiao, English gold rose by eight fen, US gold pound rose by seven jiao, US dollar bill rose by one fen, Hong Kong bill rose by half a li, French franc bill rose by 2.5 hao, Singapore bill rose by two fen, Australian gold bill rose by one jiao, and all other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities Market Sees Many Optimistic Factors Is It Real, Or Is It Not?

The securities market yesterday was still rather firm, there were many rumors of peace in the market, and the issue of resuming operations at the exchange was also being prepared. In addition, new international loans have been established, and the morale of the market is gradually increasing. Since the change in interest law on January 16, the market has plummeted and has only recently gradually woken up and slowly returned higher. In the past, the process has mostly been affected by the outflow of spot goods from Xie Da. Sales have gradually shrunk to this day, and most of the goods issued by this firm have been absorbed by the financial industry at low prices, so the market does not take it seriously, and retail investors have also been absorbing it quite a bit. Therefore, the future market price may still be able to return to its previous state. Yesterday, it was still only half a day of trading. The first buyers were Runli and Tongkang, and the market price tightened. Although there were a few sales from No. 46 and Xie Da, retail demand was still strong, and No. 38 was trading in type B for type C and E, which was quite a large amount. The market is still seeing demand exceeding supply, and the market trend is still rising. There was still no trading in type D, and the market price resulted in a continuation of good conditions, with increases of 2.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was approximately 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Bond Type Highest Lowest Closing Previous Day

### Cotton Yarn The Main Reasons for the Sharp Drop in Yarn Prices Difficult Southern Transportation, Spring Sales Not Yet Started Tianjin Chinese Yarn Arrives in Shanghai for Sale Warehouses Stockpile More Than 100,000 Bales Small Spinning Mills Reopen

The long-standing high yarn market has recently shown a downward trend due to the fact that actual demand has not picked up after the opening of the new year. In fact, at the end of last year, wealthy people were enthusiastically collecting, expecting that there would be a new atmosphere in the new year, that customer sales would be smooth, and that prices would rise. Therefore, the closing price last year had risen to 403.5 yuan. However, the opening price of the new year was not as high as expected, and the period of high prices was very short. The high price had reached 406 yuan, but customer demand was sluggish and undeveloped. Since the Japanese invasion of Hainan Island, the war has continued. As for eastern Zhejiang, although our military positions are solid and the people are peaceful, Japanese warships are constantly harassing the area. All of the above conditions have prevented the market from moving forward and have put heavy pressure on it. Therefore, prices have fallen instead of rising. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn has fallen by about 10 yuan compared to the end of the year. According to reliable sources, the products of Tianjin Chinese yarn have been squeezed out of the market by other yarns and have no foothold there. They are now being transported south to find a way out. Soon, 4,000 to 5,000 bales will arrive in Shanghai, and the next batch will have several thousand bales. According to research, the amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth stored in the warehouses in this city is full, with an estimated inventory of more than 100,000 bales, of which Chinese yarn accounts for more than 60% and Japanese yarn accounts for slightly less than 40%. In terms of the current situation, it cannot be said that the 100,000 bales of yarn in stock is not a lot. However, yarn sales are still in the peak season of spring sales. If prices fall, there may be a large amount of development. Therefore, Mr. Wu and the financial community are absorbing and maintaining prices in the market every day. There is also a saying that the newly created small spinning mills, with nearly 100,000 spindles, have already been able to fully operate, and the amount of production has certainly increased. However, the raw cotton cannot be relaxed, and the factory's costs are higher than in the past. (A)

Transactions Between Industry Peers Account for 80%

The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline became more and more severe. Due to the poor environment, sluggish actual demand, and the lack of appetite from customers, most speculators, seeing the poor momentum, sold off according to the market. The trading floor was very loose, but certain industry peers absorbed a large amount of long positions, and continued to buy at low prices. Their intention was that it was still early in the spring sales season, and according to folk customs, the villagers were still entertaining themselves, and customer sales would only develop after the Lantern Festival. The market still had hope of rising, so the amount of money they ate in continued to increase, and their desire to see prices rise was very deep. According to a survey of the market transactions throughout the day, the transactions between industry peers and hoarders accounted for more than 80%.

Double Horse Yarn Falls 4.5 Yuan

As for the situation of existing yarn, the market was tired at the opening in the morning. Because actual transactions were not active, the market was overwhelmed with sellers, and the opening price fell by 1 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 399 yuan, and 30 bales were transacted between industry peers. A cotton company also came to vomit. The market price gradually decreased. The final price of Double Horse was 395.5 yuan, but the trend was still weak. Fortunately, a certain person came to buy 100-200 bales of Double Horse yarn from a foreign warehouse, and the market was able to stabilize. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 1,645 bales throughout the day. Industry peers transacted 1,310 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell 5.5 yuan, Double Ball fell 4 yuan, Te Jincheng fell 3 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell 5 yuan, and coarse yarn fell 1-2 yuan. The Xinhe Yarn Factory opened with 150 bales of 20-count Five Sons at a price of 395 yuan. Yesterday, 640 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, and 35 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each group is listed on the left.

Industry Peers 1,310 Xiamen 25

Yunnan 185 Shantou 80

Wenzhou 35 Ningbo 10

Total 1,645

Crystal Yarn Also Falls by 2 Yuan

Trading in Japanese yarn remained as sluggish as ever. The needs of all parties were sparse, and market prices also tended to go downstream. The price of 20-count Mizuki yarn was 335-333 yuan, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 330-328 yuan, both falling by 2 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Although Yarn Prices Fall, Raw Cotton Is Not Affected Due to Difficulty in Shipping From Production Areas

The raw cotton business has not seen much development, but Chinese and foreign factories have gradually become more active. Therefore, although yarn prices have fallen, raw cotton prices have been able to maintain their stability. In fact, the stock is weak. In addition, in this chaotic environment, the best cotton from the various production areas has already been loaded and exported by others. What remains are inferior goods, and the roads are difficult and the taxes are heavy, making it difficult to ship them out. The few that can reach Shanghai are like fish that have slipped through the net. According to this situation, how can market prices fall? There is still no supply from Tonghua. However, a British ship arrived in Shanghai from Europe the day before yesterday, with 2,600 pieces of cotton from Bombay, all purchased by Japanese merchants. The current cotton transaction volume and market prices are listed on the left.

### Shenxin Purchases High-Grade Indian Cotton

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was exceptionally quiet, with no new developments. Smith's proposal may be passed in two weeks, and all industry peers are very supportive of his proposal. Recently, due to sluggish sales of cloth, factories have ample inventory, so there have only been sporadic transactions in spot goods. Yesterday, New York rose by 3-4 pounds, India fell by half a rupee including the forecast, and Egypt rose by more than 10 pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate was flat, and converting to legal currency, the price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 1 jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by 4 jiao.

Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai remained sluggish. Factories were all taking a wait-and-see attitude towards purchasing raw cotton due to the weak yarn prices. If there were any particularly cheap prices, they would buy a little. Yesterday, Shenxin bought 500 bales of high-grade Indian cotton, which was white, moist, and clean, with long and soft fibers. The factory price was only 73 yuan, and the quality was much higher than that of Changyinsha, making it very cheap. On the Japanese side, Gongda bought 500 bales of Indian cotton, Toyota bought 500 bales of Indian cotton, and Shanghai and Yufeng each bought 500 bales of Indian cotton. The cotton prices from yesterday are listed below.

Recently, due to requests from students who have come to Shanghai from afar and are eager to pursue further studies, it has been decided to hold another enrollment examination on February 28th to avoid regrets. As for the attached middle school, it is heard that an examination will also be held on March 1st.

School Overview

Nanyang Tutorial School

Nanyang Tutorial School, located at No. 302 Baker Road, is jointly run by Wu Hesi, renowned in both education and science, and Qian Fuqu, the principal of the First Elementary School of Nanyang Middle School. Although it was established this semester, the directors and teachers of each department are mostly experts and university professors. The school's purpose is not only to provide supplementary lessons and cultivate vocational talents in spare time but also to pay special attention to improving the skills and knowledge of elementary and secondary school teachers and training experts. It is divided into three departments: Supplementary, Specialized, and Vocational, with courses including Chinese, English, Japanese, Russian, Mandarin Conversation, English Conversation, Japanese Conversation, Russian Conversation, Mathematics (from Arithmetic to Calculus), Natural Sciences (Biology, Physics, and Chemistry), History and Geography, Commercial Courses (Commercial Bookkeeping, Bank Accounting, Government Accounting, Corporate Accounting, Cost Accounting, Commercial Abacus), Document Application (specializing in applied writing such as official documents, correspondence, contracts, etc.), Calligraphy, Painting and Sculpture (Calligraphy, Chinese Painting, Sculpture, etc.), Stenography (Chinese, English), Chemical Handicraft, Specimen Making, Wireless Engineering, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Western Medicine, and Harmonica. The directors of each department include Zhu Jianmang for Chinese (the author of the Chinese textbooks for all levels of the World Book Company), Principal Wu personally teaches Document Application, Fang Guangtao for English and English Conversation (Professor of Linguistics at Jinan University), Xu Zhuodai for Japanese (also known as Li Amao), Russian Slaloff for Russian and Russian Conversation (Professor of Literature at Moscow University), Bi Jingqian for Mathematics (former Professor of Mathematics at Fudan University), Xue Deyu for Biology (Biology expert and instructor at the Central Political School), Gui Chengtai for Higher Commercial Courses (accountant), Cai Rui for Calligraphy, Painting, and Sculpture (former president of the Shenzhou Chinese Medicine University and director of the Central Chinese Medicine Museum), and Zhang Zanchen (famous surgeon, director of the Central Chinese Medicine Museum, and editor of the Medical Spring and Autumn Society), etc. Other departments also have specialized experts. Since the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, the number of faculty and students from universities and middle schools who have sacrificed on the front lines and in other areas is alarming. It is currently urgent to replenish talents to meet the needs of the country and society. If the elementary school education, which is the foundation of education, and the secondary school, which is the backbone, are too slow and time-consuming, it is currently appropriate to focus on university and supplementary education, especially the latter, which has rapid results. Therefore, Mr. Wu is running this Nanyang Tutorial School to test whether the results can meet his ideals. If the students develop well, it will be expanded into a university. For example, the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine will be changed to a Medical College, the Department of Calligraphy, Painting, and Sculpture will be expanded into an Academy of Art, and the Language Departments will be combined into a College of Liberal Arts. A University Preparatory Committee has been organized. Furthermore, Nanyang Tutorial School has set up individual tutoring classes every Saturday and Sunday to help students from various schools improve their studies. It provides detailed guidance according to the subjects and levels that the students intend to study, which is of great benefit to the students. It is heard that the opening date has been set for March 6th, and the time is from 4:00 pm to 10:00 pm every day. Except for the individual tutoring classes, every week is from Monday to Friday. Recently, the number of people who have been asking for brochures and registering has been quite enthusiastic.

Western Youth Basketball: Hualian vs. Maihong

A Conflict Occurred Last Night

With Ten Seconds Remaining, the Game Could Not Be Completed

The Audience Clamored and Threw Seats

The Referee Declared Maihong the Winner

The Western Youth basketball game between Hualian and Mai Linghong started at 9 pm last night. No fewer than eight hundred people, all eager to see the game, watched from the sidelines. This was even more crowded than the game between Hua University and Bailao. The referees were Zhai Honglu and Bolang. The competition between the two sides was extremely fierce. In the first half, Maihong took the lead with 33 points to 25. After changing sides, Maihong continued to lead. When the score reached 61 to 42, with only ten seconds remaining in the game, Wang Erde and Shen Yugong suddenly had a conflict. The audience clamored, and the game could not continue. The referee announced Maihong the winner. The audience repeatedly berated the referee.

Disrupting Order

Throwing seats at the end was inappropriate. At the beginning of the game, Hualian's Shen and Li scored continuously, and Ren and Kong each made a free throw, taking a quick lead of 6 to 0. The momentum was overwhelming. Muer scored, and Zhenzhong made a free throw. Maihong suddenly turned the tide, adding 11 points to take the lead with 13 to 7. After that, Maihong took the lead step by step, and Hualian followed closely. When Zhaoxiong came on, Zhenzhong made contributions. At the end of the first half, Maihong had 33 points and Hualian had 25. After the break, Guiqi and Ti Luo each made contributions. When the score was 45 to 37, Guangyi was fouled out four times. At 51 to 40, Muer was also fouled out. After Sailituo and Li Zhenzhong each scored a goal, Paiman scored three consecutive goals, and then was fouled out. Boluntuo made a basket, and the shamanic dispute arose. At that time, there were only ten seconds left.

The Game Ends

Maihong won with 61 points to 42. The sports director of the association, Bolatuo, said that the Western Youth League was purely to promote sports and did not favor any team. The referees hired were all experienced. The audience should not make things difficult for them and should not damage the association's gym. Although there were ten seconds left in the game, the referee had the right to declare the end of the game. In short, he expressed his deep regret for this unfortunate incident. In addition, Maijin and Youlian won two games. The results of yesterday's game and the final battle are recorded below.

The Private Shanghai Cup Soccer Tournament Concludes

Samsung Wins the Championship

Yesterday's Final Decisive Match

Defeats Yousheng 1-0

The final decisive match of the Private Shanghai Cup soccer tournament, Samsung vs. Yousheng, was held at the school's stadium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The referee was Shen Huichun. Nearly a thousand spectators attended, creating an unusually enthusiastic atmosphere. After the initial contact, Yousheng launched an attack but was blocked. Samsung countered, and Yan Shijin passed the ball forward. Jin Peigen advanced along the side and hooked it into the goal. Wu Shaotai acted too hastily, shooting over the crossbar, missing a great opportunity. It was a pity. After 20 minutes, Wu Shaotai dribbled the ball forward but was blocked. He passed it through a gap to Jin Peigen, who shot from ten yards away, hitting the net. The first half ended with Samsung leading 1-0. After changing sides, the competition between the two sides was fierce, and the performance was exceptionally wonderful. Neither side scored. As time ran out, Samsung defeated Yousheng 1-0 to win the championship. Two friendly matches were also held. Jingxing defeated Baimen A 3-0. Jingxing led 2-0 in the first half. In another match, Baimen B vs. Mixed, although Baimen B had Jia Youliang, Cao Qiuting, and Xu Chengxun, Mixed also had Zhang Mingsheng, Tan Fugen, and Prometheus Rongzhong. The two sides were evenly matched, and the battle was difficult to resolve. In the first half, Zeng Rongzhong of Mixed fouled, and Cao Qiuting scored a nine-yard penalty, giving Baimen B a 1-0 lead. In the second half, Zhang Mingsheng equalized. In the last five minutes, Zeng Rongzhong scored a goal, sealing the victory. As a result, Baimen B lost to Mixed 2-1.

And Perform in Various Countries After the Games Conclude

Chu Wishes to Take on the Preparatory Affairs for the National Games in Shanghai

China has decided to send football and basketball teams to participate in the 12th World Games. Chu Minyi sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education the day before yesterday, requesting special attention to martial arts and organizing a martial arts delegation to perform at the Games.

To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education in Chongqing, Deputy Ministers Gu and Zhang, and forwarded to Dean Dai, Brother Li Tao, and Brother Wang Rutang: The 12th World Games is scheduled to be held in Finland next year. China should participate as usual. Recalling the results of participating in the previous Games, all kinds of competitions were behind others.

All organizations and athletes should be wider in scope and better in quality than last time. Regarding the tasks in Shanghai, if entrusted, I will do my best to serve. I hope that the results of this fully prepared will bring international honor, and the martial arts delegation can take this opportunity to perform in various countries after the Games to promote China's inherent martial spirit, which is also conducive to the propaganda of the War of Resistance and national construction. Are these ideas appropriate? How should it be carried out? Please consider and reply by telegram. Your brother, Chu Minyi.

Children's Weekly: A Person Cannot Be Shameless¬†¬†Jun Peng

Shame is something everyone should have. In other words, "A person cannot be shameless."

Children! The two words "shame" are very important to our "character" and are connected and inseparable. Look! There is a person who is so poor at home that he has no food to eat. Isn't he going to starve to death? Is he just going to sit and wait for death? So he thinks of stealing money from the wealthy man next door. If he steals the money, he can live. But if he is caught, he will be sent to the government to face charges. There are also people who gather a group of companions to become robbers. But once they are caught by the government, needless to say, they will be sentenced to life imprisonment or even executed! Children! Do you think it's scary? Why did he become a thief? Why did he become a robber? Of course, it was for survival, but unfortunately, he took the wrong path in life. On the one hand, it is a social pathology, taking risks due to unemployment; on the other hand, most are blinded by greed, forgetting "shame."

In school, you must pay great attention to character, and it must be very strict. But when you find something on the ground, do you return it to the owner? Have you ever lied to your classmates? Are you loyal? Are you diligent in your studies? Or are you not paying attention? Have you ever stolen anything from others? These many questions for reflection must be asked of yourself every day. The punishment of conscience is the most painful. Children! If we steal things from others, we are thieves. If we tell lies, we are deceiving ourselves. If we don't study diligently, we are letting down our teachers, our parents, and ourselves. We must know that robbers and thieves cannot be tolerated, even without legal sanctions, where is our personality? Personality is the second life and is even more important than life because there is a saying: "One wrong step leads to eternal regret; it is too late to turn back after a hundred years!" Experience it deeply!

Making a Rabbit Lantern with Duck Eggshells¬†¬†Xinsheng

Once the Spring Festival holiday arrives, children inevitably follow their parents to stroll down the street. Some younger brothers and sisters are attracted by the colorful paper lanterns and inevitably clamor to buy them. As a result, it's always a costly expense.

Here, I will teach children how to make eggshell lanterns. I think you must have the time to make some to play with. You can practice your handicrafts, and you can give them to your younger siblings to play with. Why wouldn't you do such a win-win task?

The main material for making the lantern is, of course, a duck eggshell. Open a hole in the side (middle) of the duck egg and trim it with scissors (Figure 1). This is the body of the rabbit. There are two ways to make the rabbit's head: Figure 2 is three-dimensional; Figure 3 is a single piece, which needs to be glued together on both sides and then glued to the eggshell along the dotted line. In Figures 2 and 3, the rabbit ears and eyes are drawn on the original paper. If you cut the two ears separately and then glue them to the top of the head, and then thread thin bamboo strips through the eyes, and thread two swollen soybeans on both ends of the bamboo strips, and then dye the soybeans red with red ink, the shape of the head will be more vivid. The rabbit's tail is a small piece of cotton, glued to the other end of the eggshell with glue.

After the rabbit's whole body is made, we can prepare the lamp. There are two types of lamps: one is a hanging type (Figure 4), drill four small holes around the opening of the eggshell, and tie them with four thin copper wires. In this way, it can be hung. If you want to hold it, prepare another bamboo pole and tie the copper wire to the head of the bamboo pole. The other type is a towed type (Figure 5), use cardboard to paste a rectangular paper box that is slightly larger than the matchbox core, thread two thin bamboo poles through the side of the box in parallel, to serve as an axle, and then use four wooden abandoned chess pieces, each with a small hole drilled in the center, and insert them on both ends of the bamboo pole to form a small car with two pairs of wheels. Then glue the finished rabbit body inside the car, and then install a small ring in front of the car, so that you can tie the line to tow it.

The rabbit lamp can be dyed in various colors, colorful and bright are the most suitable. Because it is a toy, you don't need to worry about its natural body color. The lamp's internal lighting device is very simple, you only need to find a small iron pot for oil paste, and then cut a round iron sheet, and use cotton thread as the wick; fill the box with a little soybean oil to be used as fuel. This oil lamp is placed inside the eggshell. (As shown in Figure 6)

From the above rabbit lantern, we can also make: goldfish lanterns, duck lanterns, airplane lanterns and car lanterns. The front end of the goldfish lantern should be made into two protruding eyeballs, and in addition, install a paper star and a pair of soft paper fins for the chest, abdomen, buttocks, and back can be omitted: The head and tail of the duck lamp can refer to the rabbit lamp's production method; The airplane lamp's fuselage should be made of cardboard glued to the eggshell; The above three types are hanging type, the last one is a car lamp which is towed type, and its production method is simpler than the rabbit lamp, only need to install two car lights at its front end, and then install a car window in the middle to complete it. The colors of the above various eggshell lanterns can be arranged by yourself, but you must pay attention to the average weight before and after. I think the children will also be able to turn out other more fun eggshell lanterns!

Passing the Pond Company (Continued)¬†¬†Bai Zheng

The manager of the company and Mr. Li were from the same hometown. They were talking in Anhui dialect, which Ming'er couldn't understand. They talked for a long time. Later, Mr. Li said to Ming'er's father: "Recently, the situation here is very tense. The boats in the Qiantang River have been seized for military use, and the price of boats has soared, almost doubling the usual price. Because those boatmen are very timid and dare not come here. I have asked him to think of a solution for us."

People were constantly entering and leaving the company. Some were carrying large packages out, and some were carrying things in. The staff members held a string of bamboo sticks and gave each porter a stick. Ming'er wanted to go up. He was sure that each stick was the price of each decision. He watched silently from the side.

Mr. Li asked the manager to prepare their dinner. Before long, four bowls of dishes were placed on the table, two meat and two vegetarian. Ming'er was already very hungry, and there was never such a rich meal on the small boat. Therefore, he sat down unceremoniously. At that time, the drool in his mouth was about to slide from the corner of his mouth, but he restrained himself. That night, he ate heartily.

Ming'er's father and Mr. Zhang and Li went out to inquire about the recent battles. Ming'er also followed his father. In a grocery store, there was a radio broadcasting news of the war. They stood and listened for more than ten minutes. The news of the war did not disappoint them too much. They quickly returned to the company, hoping to get a boat tonight and leave here, because this place was not suitable for a long stay.

Becoming a Little Radio Expert (3)¬†¬†Xi Ren

(2) Knowing Parts

"Then what is the use of a capacitor?" Wang Min asked. "The use of a capacitor is to store electricity, so it is called capacitance. Capacitance means that it can accumulate electricity." His cousin paused and said, "Capacitors can be divided into two types. One is fixed, called a fixed capacitor (see Figure 1 in the previous issue). The other is adjustable, called a variable capacitor."

"Then are there only these two styles of capacitors?" Wang Min quickly continued his cousin's words and asked.

"No, there are more than these two styles of capacitors. The adjustable ones also have three-gang and four-gang types, which are made by connecting three or four adjustable capacitors together to form a single capacitor." His cousin took out a handkerchief to wipe his nose and continued, "But this kind of capacitor is only used in large radios. We will talk about it later. Oh, I forgot to tell you that these capacitors are available in radio shops. But the people in the shop call it a 'condenser.' As long as you say 'condenser,' they will give you a capacitor."

After saying a lot, Wang Min didn't say a word. His cousin turned around to look at him and saw that he had opened his mouth and was listening intently, so he couldn't help but laugh and say, "Hey, Min, what are you doing?"

"Oh, brother, I'm listening to you," Wang Min said happily. "I already know a little about capacitors. I think you can teach me again this afternoon‚Ä¶" Wang Min hadn't finished speaking when his mother came to call them for lunch. His cousin said, "Let's go eat. We'll talk about something else this afternoon."

Wang Min's mother made a lot of dishes because Wang Min's cousin rarely came. Wang Min ran back to the side room after only eating one bowl of rice because he only remembered his cousin talking about the radio. He picked up various things and looked at them by himself, but he didn't understand anything. He only saw all kinds of things filling a table.

He unintentionally picked up something round with pointed ends (see Figure 2A). While he was looking at it, his cousin ran in. He ran forward and asked his cousin, "Brother, what is this called?"

His cousin picked up the thing in Wang Min's hand and looked at it and said, "Oh, is this it? It's called a mineral. Haven't you heard of a mineral radio? A mineral radio must use this." His cousin put the thing with pointed ends on the table and then picked up something like Figure 2B on the side and continued, "There are several kinds of minerals. The one you just saw is called a fixed mineral." His cousin raised the thing he was holding in his hand and said, "This is called a variable mineral, but there are two kinds of variable minerals. One is covered with glass (see Figure 2C)." As his cousin spoke, his eyes saw something wound up with something like a wire, and he pointed to it and said to Wang Min, "Do you know what this is called?"

Wang Min replied, "I don't know."

His cousin said, "This is called a coil. It is the most important thing in a radio. There are two kinds of coils: one is wound with a paper board like a spider web, called a spider web coil; the other is wound with a cylinder, called a cylindrical coil (see Figure 3)." His cousin paused here and then continued: "Now, almost all the parts for a simple radio have been discussed, except for a headset. A headset is something that is put on the ears and has two black circles (see Figure 4)."

The Story of Mud¬†¬†Ailian

On the bank of a small river, there was an ordinary, rough, and heavy clod of mud. Although it was so ordinary, it often fantasized about its great value, and there would eventually be an opportunity to be discovered in this wonderful world.

Initially, in the warm sunlight of spring, plants gradually awakened, revealing their flowers and leaves, whispering to each other about their future glory. Forests also grew on the beautiful earth, adorned with millions of tiny rubies and green jade scattered among the light, drifting clouds. Vivid flowers brought shocking joy as they bowed their necks and whispered to their sisters when caressed by the gentle breeze, "You are so lovely, making this day bright and radiant."

The meandering river also joyfully kept time, striking against the riverbank, producing musical tones, telling how they had gained freedom from the ice's confinement, with new vitality flowing down from the snow-capped mountains, stirring the water wheels in the mill, doing great work, and making the huge ships drift on the vast ocean.

At that time, the mud waited dumbly on the bank for its opportunity, comforting itself that it would have a valuable future. "My opportunity will come," it said to itself. "I will not be buried forever. This season, honor, beauty, and praise undoubtedly belong to me."

One day, the mud felt a flat iron shovel under itself, lifting it up from the place where it had waited for so long, and throwing it into a cart with another pile of mud. The cart took it away. After going through rugged mountain roads, enduring many bumps, it was not afraid at all, but encouraged itself: "This is necessary. The road to glory must have bumps. Now I am on the road to contributing to the world."

Although this journey was difficult, nothing more painful followed. It was placed in a narrow trough, mixed, hammered, stirred, and trampled, which almost made it unbearable. But it was full of hope - only after this hardship could there be a beautiful and valuable result, so it received great comfort in its spirit. So it waited deeply, even thinking that the perfect result was prepared for it.

Then it was placed on a light spinning wheel, it worried that such a fast spin would split its body into thousands of pieces. Then there was a great pressure and a mold added to its body, and after another spin, it felt a dizziness and pain, and it became another appearance.

A hand, no one knows whose, put it in the stove. The fire was so blazing - terrible and sharp - hotter than the shore in the hot summer. After all this hardship, it could endure it like this, because it believed that it would have a great future. "Of course," it thought, "I am willing to suffer, as long as I become a gorgeous item. Perhaps I am an ornament in a chapel, or a precious vase in front of the emperor."

Later, this baking process was over. It was taken out of the oven and placed on a wooden board. It saw the blue sky, and in this cool air, it felt comfortable all over. Ah! The suffering is over! Glory is near!

Next to the wooden board, there was a not very clear pool, but it was still enough to reflect the shadow. At first, when it was picked up, it saw its new look from the pool - this was the reward for patience and suffering, its expectations were fulfilled - an ordinary vase, hard and straight, red and ugly. It felt that it would not be displayed in the emperor's palace or the palace of art, because it was made so unbeautifully. It was deeply dissatisfied and complained to its maker: "Why did you make me like this?"

It was depressed and unhappy for many days. Later, it felt that it was full of soil, and there was something brown and rough, like death, placed in the soil. It was prepared to resist this new shame. "I am full of dirty waste. This is obviously bad for me. I am undoubtedly a failure."

But now it was placed in the greenhouse, where the sun gently caressed it, and clear water irrigated it. It waited for opportunities every day. Suddenly, it felt that something inside it was moving - this was brand new hope. But it remained ignorant, not understanding the meaning of this new hope.

One day, it was picked up again and taken to a solemn chapel. Its expectations had indeed come. It occupied a good position in the world. Glorious music played. Many flowers surrounded it, making it confused. It gently asked a vase nearby, "Why did they put me here? Why are so many people looking at us?" The vase replied, "Don't you know? Your belly brings the emperor's precious lilies, with their snow-white petals and golden hearts. So many people are looking at them because they are the most peculiar in the world. Their roots are in your belly, and you are so glorious!"

Finally, the mud was greatly satisfied, deeply grateful to its maker,

### Grain Prices: Flour Mills Rush to Manufacture, Anticipating Flour Adjustments; Wheat Market Merely Ornamental

The flour market has not seen any special changes. Due to the weekend period, merchant demand is slow to move. In recent days, both northern and southern merchants have transacted a total of 200,000 bags of various brands of flour, all of which need to be transported and loaded successively. Flour mills are rushing to manufacture to meet the demand, in order to supply the market. It is heard that sales during the New Year period in this street were also quite good. The wholesale price of old brands, including the delivery cost, is 4.805 yuan per bag. The retail cash price is 4.65 yuan per bag. It is also heard that flour mills are expected to make adjustments for the merchants' futures flour orders but are very firm on sales in this street. Yesterday, transactions in this street were estimated at about 7,000 to 8,000 bags. Transactions from the Shandong, Hebei, and Shantou merchants totaled about 30,000 bags. The market is still brewing. Yesterday, 41,000 bags of flour were shipped to Shantou.

Wheat market transactions continue to be sluggish. The day before yesterday, only 3,000 bags were opened for trading. Yesterday, the market only opened with 400 bags. This is because the mills currently have imported wheat arriving, and the need for local wheat is naturally not strong. However, the owners of the goods are holding onto prices due to high costs and lack of spot goods, resulting in few transactions and only serving as a mere ornament to the market. The total sales included two types of wheat, Yangzhou and Nanjing wheat, amounting to only 400 bags, all of which were purchased by the Fufeng Mill. The Fuxin Mill made no purchases yesterday. The market has become ordinary.

### Speculators Actively Purchase Du Rice in the Afternoon

Yesterday's supply of domestic rice from Heshang only arrived at the fourth warehouse, with over 3,000 bags transported by trucks. The initial market was quite sluggish, with only this street being slightly active. However, after purchases by speculators in the evening, the market turned from sluggish to tight. As a result, various types of goods showed mixed trends. Thick japonica rice rose slightly for northern merchants, while there was not much change for southern merchants. The path for special grade thin rice was relatively strong, showing a good trend. Medium-grade rice was slightly weak. Du foreign rice, pointed rice, and top-quality goods were scarce and also saw a slight increase of a few cents to a dime. The increased price of Bi√†nyu√°n rice reduced demand slightly, and the price turned stable.

### Early Rice Continues to Rise Outside the Corners

Yesterday's arrival of early rice was very scarce, and stores and brokers have already begun to inquire. Due to high costs and production prices not being low, owners insisted not to sell easily. Therefore, the entire day's transactions did not exceed 2,000 bags, and prices continued to rise. Nanjing high early rice opened at 11.5 yuan, while Wu early rice opened at 11.1 yuan. Newly arrived Taixing machine early rice also opened at 11.25 yuan. Although current inventory in Shanghai is sufficient, transporting it is quite profitable. Moreover, merchants from Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other regions have demand. Therefore, stores and speculators are even more hopeful about the market.

### North-South Goods: Lychees and White Lotus Seeds; Spring Dishes All Firm

Yesterday, the first batch of Jinshan lychees from Hong Kong firms opened for trading. Top-grade round lychees were priced at 62.2 yuan, and flat lychees were priced at around 63 yuan, with subsequent grades slightly lower. Glutinous rice lychees opened at 153 yuan, and Chen Hainan pulp opened at 43 yuan. New goods were not transacted due to unreasonable counter-offers. However, given the thin inventory and firm base, if demand continues, there is a definite possibility of further price increases in the future market.

Lanxi white lotus seeds do not have many arrivals and inventory, and the market is firm. A small amount was offered yesterday. Those with better color were priced at 100 yuan, and those of secondary quality were priced at 97 yuan. There was a batch of Hunan lotus seeds from a merchant, sold through brokers. The merchants' offer was still 4 to 5 yuan short, and no transaction was made.

### Building Materials: Foreign Pine Has Little Change; Hardware Inevitably Hoarded

Building materials are mostly domestic, but foreign goods occupy a significant position in hardware. Due to tight foreign exchange and rising prices, people are optimistic and inevitably hoarding. Therefore, prices for this spring's trading all see rises. Although foreign pine is a foreign good, it is constrained by domestic pine and fir wood, and prices are inevitably suppressed.

### Coal: 2,000 Tons of New White Coal Unsuitable to be Sold

The white coal business sees a decline in sales due to the reduced use of stoves. Therefore, at the beginning of the New Year's trading, Hongji white coal remained unchanged at 45 yuan per ton. Unexpectedly, on the second day of trading, due to the small initial arrival of goods, buyers eagerly purchased them. The new 2,000 tons were not enough to meet the sales demand, and the owners seized the opportunity to raise prices. Hongji medium chunks were priced at 47 yuan per ton, screened chunks at 49 yuan, and roasted chunks at 51 yuan. Delivery by the Yangjingbang carts of the same trade incurred additional handling fees.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bran Manipulation Fails

The bran market situation has been like a rudderless boat, with people feeling uneasy. Although skilled manipulators have employed their usual tactics, the strategy of using Chinese to control Chinese has ultimately failed. Yesterday's situation showed a slight relaxation, with the Guandao market falling back and the company showing signs of wavering. In the market yesterday, only 4,000 bags of old warehouse receipts for small packages from Fufeng Huafeng were transacted at 3.2 yuan, an increase of 2.5 cents compared to the previous market. Today, 1,000 bags of bran will be shipped to Shantou.

### Hardware: Sales to Out-of-Town Merchants Particularly Strong

Since the prices of various types of hardware gradually rose after the beginning of the year's trading, and because only half of the local factories in Shanghai have resumed operations, sales have been scarce. However, sales to merchants from out of town have been particularly strong. Merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao have purchased large quantities. For example, No. 26 Da Ma Kou tinplate sold for 120 to 130 yuan per box, with over a hundred boxes reportedly sold. Other items, such as new steel plates, new lead wire, angle iron, black iron sheets, plain white iron, round nails, and iron from new and old steel mills, such as US Steel, were also purchased in large quantities. Prices were similar to the beginning of the year.

### Silk and Tea: Factory Prices Have Soared by 400 Yuan in the Last Four Decades

Yesterday's silk market continued to advance in a rising trend. Foreign firms sold 7-8 grade raw silk at 1,720 yuan, not considering it a good price. Ordinary raw silk for domestic users, such as the TH brand, has been sold at 1,000 yuan. Jili silk, the Python brand, is priced at 1,020 yuan. Market expectations are for further advances. According to the statistics of the Foreign Silk Association, the average price of 7-8 grade R-brand raw silk in the first half of February has soared 280 yuan compared to the first half of January (the price before January 15 was 1,300 yuan, and the price before February 15 was 1,580 yuan). From February 15 to the recent ten days, the same grade of raw silk has soared another 140 yuan. Such a rise can be described as unprecedented. The increase in the rate of the Jili silk XA grade is quite alarming. The price in the first half of January was 810 yuan, the price in the first half of February was 920 yuan, and the current selling price has soared another 100 yuan.

Yesterday, the overseas silk market remained firm. Although the exchange rates in the Japanese and American exchanges slightly decreased, the actual sales prices in New York all opened at the original price, and prices in Lyon all rose. In terms of silk sales in Shanghai, foreign firms sold 50 loads of raw silk, printing houses sold 20 loads of local silk, and domestic users sold 25 loads. Market prices were all tighter than before. Both buyers and sellers still consider these transactions to be auspicious for the new year.

Yesterday, 12 pieces of Huzhou silk and 998 boxes of tea were shipped to Europe.

### Textiles: Congestion in Coastal Defense Warehouses; Sichuan and Yunnan Helpless

Eastern textiles are slightly stable.

Domestic cloth sales are scarce and the market is weak. This is because both local and out-of-town cloth merchants have gained substantial profits in the past year, with abundant funds and inventory accumulating at double the previous rate. This inevitably exceeds demand. Additionally, during the new year's trading period, Zhejiang Province issued warnings, and goods pre-ordered by the Wen and Yong merchants from the previous year all remained in Shanghai and were unwilling to be shipped. Yesterday, Sichuan and Yunnan also stopped purchasing goods due to congestion in coastal defense warehouses. However, ports in Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and the Fujian coast are all unobstructed, and purchases are still made sporadically. Merchants from the northern route of Tianjin purchased nearly 200 boxes of plain silk, woolen cloth, blue cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. Wholesale shops in this street are selectively replenishing products in response to the new year's season, as they had a successful business last year. Dafeng, Hengfeng, Central, and Lunchang factories sold two hundred and several tens of boxes of dark-colored and white-ground satin crepe printed fabric. Merchants from Jiangxi purchased forty to fifty pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth from brands such as Dapeng. Market prices for white fine cloth and fine twill were 10 to 20 cents lower than the beginning of the year's trading, and dyed and processed goods were also reduced by 10 to 30 cents. However, printed goods were relatively firm, and white-ground satin crepe was out of stock. Lunchang printed cloth increased by 5 cents, and straight tribute satin increased by 2 dimes. The surge in gold prices increased the manufacturing cost of fabrics, so people in general are still optimistic.

Yesterday, the market for white goods in eastern textiles was slightly stable. Although sales remained sluggish in terms of actual sales, factories and merchants insisted on not relaxing on futures orders. Large firms remain optimistic, and retail investors have limited short-selling power. Therefore, sales prices for fine cloth and fine twill have slightly turned upward, with fine cloth shouting higher by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Fine twill has no gains or losses, and it is on the path to stability. Retail customers in this street purchased more than 400 pieces of spot goods.

Today, 400 pieces of textiles will be exported to Shantou, 2 pieces to Hong Kong, and 110 pieces to Guangzhou.

### Woolen Cloth and Flannel Red Opening, Add 5 Cents to 1 Dime of Silver

Yesterday was the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, and the woolen cloth and flannel industries all opened for business on the fifth day of the lunar month. Yesterday, brokers ran around taking samples, which was quite busy. Looking at the prices in general, the market prices were all higher than the closing prices by 5 to 10 cents of silver. Fellow merchants are very optimistic. However, buyers‚Äô purchases were limited because (1) the opening price was too high, (2) merchants had made considerable profits last year and they made more search and absorption than in previous years, and (3) there real sales are still pending after the Lantern Festival. Due to these three reasons, most people have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so there were not many large-scale transactions.

Shanghai Educational Circle: Opinions on Reforming Education

### The Problem of In-Service Secondary School Teachers Continuing Education After the Establishment of Normal Colleges (2)

‚Äî Huang Shijin

(2) The Current Situation of In-Service Secondary School Teachers

What is the current situation of secondary school teachers in our country? Several people have conducted investigations. According to Mr. Tong Runzhi, only 15% of teachers nationwide have received professional training in the past. Among ten teachers, eight do not understand what education is, and three are teaching secondary school students with a secondary school education. Education in Zhejiang Province is known to be developed, but according to the statistics of the province in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the qualifications of teachers in secondary schools throughout the province are also not sound. Those who have graduated from normal universities and higher normal schools account for only 10.44%. In 1935, Mr. Zheng Xigu was commissioned by the China Education Society to study the issue of secondary school teacher training. According to his statistics, currently, teachers in secondary schools with university degrees account for 40.28% of the total, graduates of specialized schools account for 14.11%, graduates of higher normal schools or specialized courses account for 2.99%, graduates of domestic normal universities or colleges of education account for 11.35%, and those who have studied abroad and obtained degrees account for 5.02%. From the above figures, we can know that most of the current secondary school teachers in our country are unqualified and lack professional training.

Someone analyzed various professions in society and found that there are only four specialized professions that take "people" as their work object: doctors, lawyers, pastors, and teachers. Doctors work to save lives, lawyers work to protect human rights, pastors work to cultivate people, and teachers work to improve life. People who engage in these four types of work must receive professional training in order to achieve something. In Europe and the United States, the qualifications and status of these four professions are highly valued. In our country, there is no tolerance for doctors who prescribe the wrong medicine and lawyers who misjudge cases, but there is no attention paid to teachers who mislead young people. This is a serious oversight. Is it that the treatment of diseases requires professional doctors, the judgment of laws requires professional lawyers, but the cultivation of personality and the training of thought do not require professional teachers? This shows that we have put the cart before the horse, regarding the body as more important than character and property as more valuable than personality. We should know that modern teachers are different from those in ancient times. Since the evolution of modern political organization, the state has taken on the responsibility of education. At the same time, education has been regarded as a tool for implementing national policies and a path to revitalizing the nation. Therefore, modern teachers cannot be dismissed by anyone who has received a little general education. Mr. Zheng‚Äôs survey of the opinions of 46 middle school principals pointed out many weaknesses of incumbent teachers, such as (A) in terms of knowledge, (1) lack of professional knowledge, (2) lack of education knowledge, (3) inability to thoroughly understand the subject they teach because they do not teach what they have learned, etc.; (B) in terms of skills, (1) lack of training in teaching skills, (2) only knowing how to teach books but not learning guidance, (3) lack of management skills to maintain classroom order, lack of industrial skills to manufacture teaching aids, etc.; (C) in terms of ideals, (1) lack of sense of responsibility, (2) lack of spirit of cooperation, (3) inconsistency in words and deeds and inability to set an example, (4) only seeking perfunctory performance and not assuming the responsibility of training, (5) lack of educational beliefs and the determination to devote themselves to education for life, etc.; (D) in other aspects, (1) lack of sound physical fitness, (2) lack of proper hobbies, etc. From this, it can be seen that the current situation of incumbent secondary school teachers in our country is unsatisfactory.
